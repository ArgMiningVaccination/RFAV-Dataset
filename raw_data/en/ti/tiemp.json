On a personal level, I am working with a distinguished faculty who have been friends and colleagues throughout my 14 yearsleading Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. This issue of Robert Wood Johnson Medicine highlights people at this school who make academic med- icine so exciting as, together, we pursue continued success in our commitment to providing great care toevery patient. Our cover article, \"TeamSTEPPS: Student-Led Teamwork Training Focuses on Patient Safety\" ( page 17), underscores the importance of student-led initiatives. Piloted by two student-veterans, the project is fulfillingour vision of teaching strong teamwork skills to reduce medical risk and improve patient outcomes. We turn to the career of Stephen R. Brant, MD, professor of medicine and chief, division of gastroenterol- ogy and hepatology (\"Sails Up,\" page 27). Dr. Brant identified key regulators of inflammatory bowel disease and later expanded research into afflicted but unstudied populations. As associate director of the Crohn'sand Colitis Center of New Jersey, he regularly sees patients\u2014his favorite part of the week. As we continue to grow our clinical enterprise to make top-notch care accessi- ble to all patients, andrologist Nikhil Gupta, MD, assistant professor of surgery,helps us achieve that goal by restoring sexual function and hope to men of allages (page 10). A second andrologist, Aaron Grotas, MD '02 (page 46), is an assistant profes- sor of urology at Mount Sinai Beth Israel. A cofounder of the Mount SinaiCenter for Transgender Medicine and Surgery, he performs gender-affirming sur-gery and reconstructs past procedures that have become problematic. Vera Bennett, MD '91 (\"Advocating for Mothers and Babies in the White Mountains of Arizona,\" page 44) is a pioneer in breastfeeding medicine and a fearless champion for her patients. She is pursuing a degree in public health while supporting local efforts to provide shelter, care, andadvocacy for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and elder abuse. Dedication flows both ways. Lawrence J. Goldstein and his wife, Barbara, are confident that gastroen- terologist Michel Kahaleh, MD ( page 35), saved Mr. Goldstein's life during an episode of acute pancreatitis. Their $1 million pledge to the medical school will support Dr. Kahaleh's research on minimally invasive pro- cedures to treat bowel and pancreatic disorders. We could not be more grateful for their generosity. This issue of Robert Wood Johnson Medicine has given me a new level of appreciation for my colleagues' dedication to patient care. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I have. L E T T E R F R O M T H E D E A NANDREW HANENBERG Sincerely, Robert L.

PHOTOS BY: JOHN EMERSON 4RobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINEC\u00e9line G\u00e9linas, PhD, professor and chair, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, remembershow an internship changed her career direction. \"One summer when I was a chemistry major as an under-grad, a series of experiences in research led me to becomemore interested in biochemistry, virology, and cancer. Theseopened my mind to pursue a new direction,\" she says. Sincethen, her own forays into research have gained her an inter-national reputation. Her vision for the department is no lessambitious. Dr. G\u00e9linas has been part of the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School faculty since 1988, when she became a resi-dent member of the Center for Advanced Biotechnology andMedicine and assistant professor in the Department ofBiochemistry. Prior to her appointments at the medicalschool\u2014where she became senior associate dean forresearch in 2013\u2014she studied retroviruses and oncogenesduring postdoctoral training in the laboratory of Nobel lau-reate Howard M. Temin, PhD, at the McArdle Laboratoryfor Cancer Research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"I would say my postdoc training was transforma-tive in how I view and think about science,\" Dr. G\u00e9linassays. His way of thinking was truly inspirational and igniteda sense of curiosity that drives her to this day. \"I became even more fascinated with what we can learn from viruses tounderstand what's going on in cells and to develop betterapproaches for therapy,\" she says. That same sense of curiosity is behind the research that has earned her an international reputation\u2014investigatingthe signaling pathways that are critical in infection andinflammation and how they also contribute to cancer devel-opment and progression. \"These signaling pathways are soimportant for cells and viruses,\" she says. \"Our goal is tounderstand how they contribute to cancer and resistance totherapy.\" Other research related to HIV is also ongoing\u2014finding ways to eliminate latent HIV infection that canremain hidden for a long period of time in individuals onantiretroviral drug therapy. Dr. G\u00e9linas is a member of the Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences Council of Research Deans and has servedon many institutional and external committees, including aseditor and as reviewer for several study sections of theNational Institutes of Health. She is also the recipient ofnumerous honors for academic and research excellence, hasreceived two postdoctoral fellowships, and was presented anaward from the New Jersey Commission on CancerResearch. In addition, Dr. G\u00e9linas was inducted into theStuart D. Cook, MD, Master Educators' Guild in 2006 andwas elected a fellow in the American Academy ofMicrobiology in 2010. Dr. G\u00e9linas has a clear vision for the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. The focus on excel-lence is a given. Her goal is to build on its strengths, makingit more collaborative, inspiring, and mission-driven. \"This isa group of highly accomplished faculty. I want to fostertogetherness, help build bridges, and make us even more col-laborative and successful than we are currently,\" she says.Dr. G\u00e9linas points out the importance of building relation-ships outside the department and the school as well\u2014con-necting with others to better support and grow its researchprograms, and attract new outstanding faculty. \"It is important for us to do all we can to help those with- in the medical school achieve their full potential, to fulfilltheir own dreams of accomplishment and to celebrate theirsuccess,\" she says. \"The world of science will benefit inturn.\" C\u00e9line G\u00e9linas, PhD JOHN EMERSON6RobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINEJOHN EMERSONKeith P. professor and chair, De- partment of Anesthesiology and PerioperativeMedicine\u2014who began his career in pharmacy and cancer chemotherapy at Yale University\u2014brings focus andmotivation to improving periprocedural safety and rethinkingprocesses. \"I pursued a career in pharmacy first. I was alwaysintrigued about the safety element of medicine,\" he says.\"When I worked in a cancer chemotherapy clinic, the personwho hired me told me I would be a good candidate for med-ical school\u2014and here I am.\" Dr. Lewis' r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is a testamentto his never-ending pursuit of changing the paradigm. At Boston University School of Medicine and Boston Medical Center (BMC), Dr. Lewis served as professor andchair, Department of Anesthesiology, and chief of anesthesi-ology, respectively. He facilitated the merging of the BostonCity Hospital and Boston University Medical CenterHospital operating rooms. He served for 20 years as a senioranesthesiologist and is a past president of AnaesthesiaAssociates of Massachusetts\u2014one of the largest academicand private practices in the Boston area. There, he helped todevelop a high-risk bariatric surgery program, a state-of-the-art multimedia center, a multidisciplinary pain clinic, and asurgical robotics program, among others. He also helped toestablish a cutting-edge simulation center focusing on teamtraining. Under his leadership, his department received mul-tiple nationally recognized safety awards. Practicing anesthesiology led to Dr. Lewis' development of imaginative workspace designs. He gained renown for theconceptualization and design of the Moakley AmbulatorySurgery Center's \"ORs fast-track anesthesia techniques.Last fall, BMC introduced the Integrated Procedural Platform, another concept that Dr. Lewis helped to design,which consolidates all procedural-based specialties side byside on one floor, facilitating integrated care for patientsrequiring interventional procedures. Dr. Lewis' educational background speaks to his inner drive for constant discovery. He completed his internship insurgery at New England Deaconess Hospital and his anes-thesiology residency training at Brigham and Women'sHospital after receiving his medical degree from theUniversity of Connecticut School of Medicine. Dr. Lewisalso trained in cardiac anesthesia at Brigham and Women'sHospital and served on the Harvard faculty for 14 yearsprior to joining Boston University School of Medicine. The general theme throughout Dr. Lewis' career has been to minimize or eliminate the variables that can impact patientsafety. He designed and rolled out the official universal pro-tocol focusing on quality and patient safety at BMC, and hehas received national awards for that and other safety initia-tives. Not only did he spearhead a national symposium,\"Positioning Your ORs for the Future,\" but, with his team,he wrote a book on patient safety, OK to Proceed? What Every Healthcare Provider Should Know about PatientSafety. \"The book's 52 chapters offer strategies on how to potentially avoid adverse outcomes,\" Dr. Lewis says. \"It's allabout making the experience the safest for our patients.\" In addition to chairing the Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine at Robert Wood JohnsonMedical School, Dr. Lewis is serving as chief of anesthesiaand director of perioperative quality and safety at RobertWood Johnson University Hospital, an RWJBarnabas Healthfacility. He sees enormous potential for synergy. \"I am excit-ed that there is so much passion and commitment here, andthat everyone is invested in the concept of patient safety andstreamlining and improving the way we practice,\" he says. \"Ifeel like this is an outstanding opportunity to create leading-edge changes, providing the best value-based integrated careand putting the patient at the center of it all.\" Along with changing traditional practice and revolution- Keith P. Lewis, RPh, MD Anil Nanda, MD, MPH, Peter W. Carmel MD chair of Neurological Surgery, professor and chair, joint Department of Neurosurgery, and senior vice pres- ident, neurosurgical services at RWJBarnabas Health, knew when he was 5 years old that he wanted to be a surgeon.\"My dad was a physician,\" Dr. Nanda says, \"so I wasexposed to medicine from a young age.\" To him, surgery isthe amalgamation of science and art; it has a creative side.Add his fascination with the brain, and you can see why hespecialized in neurosurgery\u2014a career path that has garneredhim international recognition for clinical, research, and aca-demic achievements. When you ask about his interest in the educational and academic side of medicine, he offers a proverb: \"A man of70 should plant olive trees.\" You should always want toleave the next generation in better hands. \"Our children andour grandchildren should have better care,\" he says. Dr. Nanda served for 27 years as professor and founding chair of the Department of Neurosurgery at Louisiana StateUniversity Health Sciences Center in Shreveport, where helaunched a residency training program\u2014now the largest in Louisiana. He also helped build the department's Gamma Knife Radiosurgery and Neuroendovascular programs. He is recognized as a global leader in neurosurgery by the World Federation of Neurological Societies and serves as director of the American Board of Neurological Surgery. Dr. Nanda hasperformed more than 16,000 surgeries, including those for skull-based tumors and aneurysms, in which he specializes, and other procedures. Dr. Nanda is an in-demand visiting lecturer and visiting pro- fessor at conferences. He has published hundreds of articles in peer-reviewed journals and written dozens of book chapters and four books, including Complications in Neurosurgery . Dr. Nanda earned his medical degree with honors from Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education andResearch, University of Madras, in India, but he is a nativeNew Yorker. He completed his internship in surgical oncologyat Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, his residency inneurosurgery at Hahnemann University School of Medicine,his pediatric neurosurgery residency at Children's Hospital ofPhiladelphia, and his fellowship in microneurosurgery andcranial-based surgery at University of Pittsburgh MedicalCenter, Presbyterian Hospital. Dr. Nanda also holds a master of public health degree from Harvard School of Public Health and\u2014rememberinghis proverb about the olive tree\u2014helped to pass theLouisiana Youth Concussion Act, which requires all youthathletic programs to provide athletes and their parents withinformation about concussion and the potential long-termeffects of playing after a head injury. His dream is to create a destination neuroscience center at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and RWJBarnabasHealth. \"The Rutgers neurosurgical department in Newarkand the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in NewBrunswick are positioned to play a pivotal role in providingneurosurgical care for the state of New Jersey,\" he says. Thehealth care system is uniquely positioned to serve in that role,since it has a service area with 11 acute care hospitals cover-ing more than 5 million people. His goal is also to nurturescientific inquiry, publish papers, and spark interest in theclinical neurosciences, as well as develop continuing medicaleducation programs on a statewide level that target familypractice doctors, internists, neurologists, and neurosurgeons.A clinical outcomes data center is also part of his grand planto add depth to research initiatives and add impetus to pub-lication opportunities. \"We want this to become a destination for superb research with one of the best training programs in the country,\" Dr.Nanda says. \"We want to educate, be compassionate, andmake significant contributions to science.\"izing processes, Dr. Lewis also looks forward to what hecalls \"flipping the classroom\" by integrating simulation intothe educational experience. He sees great value in utilizingnew technological advances to train all health care staff. The holistic goal, as always, is to work with the communi-ty to make it healthier. That requires a willingness to look atthings differently. He believes there is great benefit in seeingthings from many perspectives while making active listeningcentral to his management style. One thing is for certain: hecan't wait to see where all of this new energy leads. 8RobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINEAnil Nanda, MD, MPH MM JOHN EMERSON10RobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINERobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINE 11Andrology : ANewSubspecial ty n the world of modern medicine, andrology is a relative new- comer. The field acquired its name only 70 years ago, bring-ing under one umbrella a variety of areas concerned withmale reproductive health, including urology, endocrinology,surgery, and genetics. In May 2018, Nikhil Gupta, MD, assistant professor of surgery, became the first andrologist and male sexual func- tion subspecialist appointed to the faculty of RutgersRobert Wood Johnson Medical School. \"To have a compre-hensive program, urology must offer this subspecialty,\"says Isaac Yi Kim, MD, PhD, MBA, professor of surgeryand acting chief, division of urology. Dr. Gupta's character,interest in research, and approach to patient care made himthe right person to inaugurate the field at the medicalschool, adds Dr. Kim, who looks forward to continuinggrowth in the division of urology. Dr. Gupta discovered andrology during his residency at the Smith Institute for Urology in New Hyde Park, NewYork, part of the Northwell Health network. He had orig-inally planned to specialize in treating patients with kidneycancer, but he found andrology to be such a \"hopeful\"field, he says, that he changed paths. Subsequently, Dr.Gupta completed a fellowship at Southern IllinoisUniversity School of Medicine under the renowned androl-ogist Kevin McVary, MD, and ultimately narrowed hisIBy Kate O'Neill Portrait by John Emerson A s an andrologist, Nikhil Gupta, MD, assistant professor of surgery (facing page), helps couples to conceive by focusing on the man and devoting a lot of time to helping them understand that infertility is neither partner's \"fault.\" He emphasizes instead what the diagnostic tests will show and how their results may help the couple start their family.12RobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINEfocus to the treatment of male infertility, sexual dysfunction, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (noncancerous enlargedprostate). He is also trained to address erectile dysfunction. It's No One's Fault Acouple is considered infertile if they have not conceived after one year of regular intercourse, without contra-ception. Often it takes two to five years for a pregnancy to occur, but it is not unusual for a couple to see Dr. Gupta after trying to conceive for a year without success. \"Often, when no pregnancy occurs, the woman is the first to see an infertility specialist, believing that the problem must orig-inate with her,\" says Dr. Gupta. But in fact, he adds, only 50percent of infertility is attributable to the female partner alone;50 percent of couples with this problem have a male factor. Ifthe woman's specialist finds no issues, she and her partnerwould most likely be referred to a specialist in male infertility. As an andrologist, Dr. Gupta's role in helping a couple to conceive focuses on the man, but he always starts out by meet-ing with both partners. He devotes a lot of time to helping thecouple understand that infertility is neither partner's \"fault,\"emphasizing instead what the diagnostic tests will show andhow their results may help the couple start their family. Infertility creates a special kind of anxiety in men, says Dr. Gupta. \"Boys are raised to believe that if you try hard enough,you can develop the strength to overcome challenges, likereaching the next level in sports. My patients fear there is some-thing wrong with their manhood, because they haven't beenable to father a child.\" Evaluating and Treating Male Infertility Evaluation starts with blood screening to determine the signaling ability of the patient's testosterone, the hor-mone that stimulates sperm production. Subsequent semen analysis provides a wealth of information as well. Findings may indicate the inability of ejaculated sperm to travel efficiently through the woman's reproductive system and pene- trate the outer covering of the egg, which awaits fertilization in her fallopian tubes. It also may show a low sperm count or an absence of sperm, which could stem from a variety of potential causes: for example, earlier trauma, childhood illness, unde- scended testis or testes, or chemotherapy. The andrologist will look for autoimmune factors in the reproductive systems of either partner, as they can be toxic to sperm. Genetics can also be a factor. A blood test can detect a microdeletion (missing gene) in the Y chromosome, a fairly common cause that is responsible for approximately 13 percent of male infertility. A clinical examination can reveal other issues leading to maleinfertility. Even if normal sperm are being produced, they may be encountering an obstruction in the male ducts, blocking themfrom their route out of the testes. Physical obstructions mayresult from a variety of other causes, including earlier hernia sur-gery or congenital abnormalities. If few or no sperm are found in the semen, Dr. Gupta can perform a microsurgical testicular sperm extraction, com-monly known as micro-TESE. With the patient under generalanesthesia, Dr. Gupta explores the testicle with a microscope,identifying and harvesting areas likely to harbor sperm thatcan be used for fertilization. Solutions for Erectile Dysfunction One of Dr. Gupta's great satisfactions is to be able to help his patients father a child. But further along theage spectrum, many other men, past the stage of starting a family, suffer from erectile dysfunction (ED) and miss this part of the pleasure of a sexually active relationship. The usual cause of ED is the failure of blood flow to the ultra-narrow arteries of the penis, and it can be a reliable pre-dictor of heart disease. Just as plaque in the arteries of theheart or brain can cause a heart attack or stroke, plaque in thearteries of the penis can prevent an erection. So Dr. Guptaoften refers his patients to a cardiologist when they come to hisoffice for treatment for erectile dysfunction. For many people, the most familiar treatments for ED are drugs such as Viagra and Cialis, which dilate the arteries of thepenis, allowing increased blood flow and a successful erection.However, Dr. Gupta offers options that have a greater successrate\u2014more than 80 percent, versus approximately 60 percentfor medications. These methods include a painless penile injec-tion that causes the penile arteries to dilate and an implanted,three-part penile prosthesis that is manually activated by asmall, built-in hydraulic pump. \"These alternatives sound so strange that when I tell men about them, their eyes pop,\" says Dr. Gupta. \"But they're will-ing to try them because they are motivated to regain the inti-macy they have lost, and other methods have failed.\" The patient's partner also plays an important role in the suc- cess of ED treatment. \"This is important,\" says Dr. Gupta,\"because any remedy is most successful when both partnersare involved together as a team.\" Dr. Gupta's career is just beginning, but with his direct and easy manner, broad knowledge, and clinical expertise, he hasalready helped previously infertile men to father children,when they were losing hope. At the same time, he has restoredintimacy for couples who thought that part of life was lost for-ever. Certainly Dr. Gupta chose well when he switched pathsand opted for the \"hopeful\" field BY JOHN EMERSONPediatric neurologist Vikram Bhise, MD, associate professor of pediatrics, chief, division of child neurology and neurodevelopmental disabilities, and medical director of the Pediatric MS Program, has dedicated his career to treating MS and other central demyelinating diseases. 14RobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINEAlexander Wallerson was 12 years old when he saw a popular movie with his mother. Now 26, he remem- bers that specific day vividly. It was the first time he experienced the signs of multiple sclerosis (MS). \"I walked like I was drunk,\" says Wallerson, who lives in New Brunswick. \"I was limping but not in pain.\" His mother, a nurse, was concerned and brought him to their family doctor. Imaging tests revealed that Wallerson had relapsing-remitting MS. It's estimated that more than 8,000 American children are currently fighting MS. The most common presentations of thedisease include optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, arm-legweakness, sensory disturbances, or balance problems. Andlike most diseases, early intervention offers the greatest hopeof mitigating patients' symptoms. Pediatric neurologist Vikram Bhise, MD, associate profes- sor of pediatrics and chief, division of child neurology andneurodevelopmental disabilities, has dedicated his career totreating MS and other central demyelinating diseases. The uni-fying characteristic of these diseases is that they damagemyelin, the substance that coats the brain's nerve fibers. As themedical director of the Pediatric MS Program, located at theChild Health Institute of New Jersey, Dr. Bhise evaluates andtreats patients presenting with neurological symptoms, focus-ing on each child's functional and cognitive status. Finding and Fighting MS When a patient experiences symptoms that might indi-cate a neuroimmune condition, Dr. Bhise orders an MRI of the brain and often a lumbar puncture\u2014the two mostuseful clinical indicators. The number and pattern of lesionson the brain visualized by the MRI help determine the level ofseverity. An MRI of the spinal cord and a blood test to deter-mine biomarkers in serum provide more clinical clues, includ-ing if the condition is one that will recur, such as MS. Then hefacilitates a frank discussion with patients and their familiesabout his findings and the treatment options, including thepotential side effects and risks of each. Establishing a relation-ship of trust is key. The only dedicated pediatric MS program in the state, Rutgers Health works in collaboration with pediatric-specificophthalmology, rehabilitation, physical therapy, psychology,urology, nephrology, and cognitive specialists to provide cutting-edge therapies, patient and family education, and access to clin-ical trials. Education in particular is a key component to care,Dr. Bhise says, since general pediatricians and neurologists may A lexander Wallerson experienced the signs of multiple sclerosis (MS) when he was 12 years old. As a patient of Dr. Bhise's at the Pediatric MS Program, Alexander received a personalized comprehensive care plan that addressed his condition and his quality of life.not have fully explained the disorder prior to referral. A comprehensive care plan is developed for each patient to address education, cognition, social functioning, mental health, daily activities, and quality of life. The disease often is moreinflammatory in children, causing younger patients to havemore frequent attacks than adults. The goal is to prevent furtherrelapses by pairing disease-modifying medical treatments withadjunct therapies, such as physical therapy, to preserve function. \"Every day that a patient lives with MS, the disease is work- ing against them,\" Dr. Bhise explains. \"The challenge is notknowing if what we do now will be effective in the future.\" The Subtle\u2014Yet Serious\u2014 Signs of Neurological Disease Like Wallerson, many patients first expe- rience motor and body-movement issues. Other signs of MS include sensoryissues, such as numbness and tingling in thebody; optic neuritis, which can appear asblurred vision, pain in the eye, and/or colordesaturation; and bladder leakage orurgency. Wallerson's high school years were punctu- ated with short episodes of double vision,right-side numbness, and left-side weakness.He discussed these issues with Dr. Bhise, whoprescribed a regimen of Rebif (interferonbeta-1a) injections every other day.Throughout his teen years, Wallerson contin-ued to play tennis and exercise, and he fol-lowed a healthy diet. He suffered only onemajor attack in high school and was able tograduate near the top of his class, garneringscholarships for college. Another disorder treated at the center is neuromyelitis optica (NMO), an incurable autoimmune disorder that attacks the opticnerves and spinal cord, and in some cases thebrain. Damage to the optic nerves causesinflammation, pain, and loss of vision, while damage to the spinal cord can lead to weak-ness or paralysis in the legs or arms, loss of sensation, and prob- lems with bladder and bowel function. Alana Essien was blindsided with recurring headaches and eye pain in fifth grade. Within a month, she was nearly blind. Diagnosed with NMO, she was referred to Dr. Bhise after seeing specialists in New York and Philadelphia. \"We didn't know much about NMO. Dr. Bhise explained thecondition thoroughly and put my mind at ease,\" says Essien,now a high school junior in South Plainfield. Despite a courseof steroids and several cycles of plasmapheresis, she has perma-nently lost 50 percent of the vision in her left eye. The vision inher right eye is typically around 20/20, while her left eye is20/50 to 20/70. She also has impaired color vision in both eyes,but the condition is worse in her left eye. She receives two infu-sions a year of Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody medication. The goal of treatment is to prevent further attacks. The attacks are what are associated with disability. Each time some-one has an attack, he or she doesn't always return to the samelevel of health. Medication keep patients like Essien from hav-ing more attacks or \"relapses.\" \"Often, diagnosing neurological disorders requires combin- ing clinical results with insights from others in the medical com-munity,\" says Dr. Bhise, who participates in periodic webinarswith neurologists across the country to share research and expe-rience. \"We have a great amount of expertise in this field, whichmeans we can provide rapid diagnostics and detailed input oneach RobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINE 15 D the fifthgrade, Essien was referred to Dr. Bhiseafter seeing specialists York and Philadelphia.\"We didn't know muchabout Dr. at ease,\" she says.16RobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINEThose who remain attack-free do well in the long term. However, those who aren't diagnosed properly or live in areas of the world with limited access to care can become blind orparalyzed from the disease. Helping Patients Hold on to Hope Fostering hope in his patients is one of the most impor-tant services that Dr. Bhise provides. He helps patients feel empowered about their care and invested in continuingtreatment. \"Committing to the care plan is how patients can exercise a sense of control over their health. I explain to patients, 'Everything that you're doing today will have a positive impact on your future.' It's easy for them to become over-whelmed, so I help remind them of the ways that life is still pretty good,\" says Dr. Bhise. \"I consider myself very fortunate,\" says Essien, who is a singer, songwriter, and pianist. \"It could be worse. There's always a way to do what you want, so keep your head up andkeep moving forward.\" At times, a diagnosis means adjusting expectations. By talk- ing with patients about their goals, Dr. Bhise helps paint a more realistic picture of living with an immune disorder. Heurges patients to discuss any issues with depression or anxietythat they're having, and he shares the latest research withpatients to keep them motivated. The program's nurses arespecially trained to engage patients to talk about their mentalstate and, if needed, can refer them for formal counseling. For Wallerson, the potential loss of dexterity interrupted his goal of becoming a neurosurgeon. Instead, he studiedinformation technology at Rutgers University and is now a3-Dmodeler for a solar energy company. Essien plans to studymusic in college. In fact, her first song, \"Dashiki Woman,\" pre-miered on iHeartRadio last year. A Commitment to Patient-Centered Care The program is involved in a number of research initia-tives designed to improve care, including developing a serum specimen bank that researchers can use to investigatenew therapies. Studies to improve patients' sleep habits andquality of life also are in motion. The program has partneredwith the New Brunswick-based Embrace Kids Foundationto provide free rides to infusion appointments for patientswho need them, as well as free iPads to use while waiting. \"That's the magic of medicine: just being good human beings to each other,\" Dr. Bhise says. MMFostering hope in his patients is one of the most important services that Dr. Bhise provides. He helps patients feel empowered about their care and invested in continuing treatment. RobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINE 17 RobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINE 17 TeamSTEPPS : Student-Led Teamwork Training Focuses on Patient Safety In military settings, teamwork is key to safe practices and successful outcomes. With this knowledge well ingrained, student-veterans at Rutgers Robert Wood JohnsonMedical School are sharing the lessons of teamwork training and experience, uniting a growing group of students and faculty behind an initiative to bring about change. Student-veterans and cocreators of the TeamSTEPPS-based program Rick Lang '19 (above left) and Kevin Fitzpatrick '19, with fellow veteran and pilot program leader Stephanie Latham '21.B Y K A T E O ' N E I L L P HOTO BY JOH N EM ER SON18RobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINE 18RobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINEThe seeds of the TeamSTEPPS-based program were sown in 2015, by student-veterans Richard Lang '19 (above left) and Kevin Fitzpatrick '19 (above right). They compared their early clinical experiences and observed areas where better teamwork and communication could improve outcomes, if health care teams would apply principles similar to those followed in the military.RobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINE 19After four years of meticulous research, planning, and initial implementation, their pilot team-building initiative is receiving significant local and even national attention. It is ready to move to the next level: changes in the health care sys- tem culture. The seeds of the program were sown in 2015, by then-first- year (M1) student-veterans Richard Lang '19 and KevinFitzpatrick '19. Lang is a U.S. Naval Academy graduate and PatTillman Foundation Scholar with 12 years of active duty serviceas a Navy F/A-18 jet pilot and instructor at the Navy FighterWeapons School (popularly called TOPGUN). Fitzpatrick graduated in 2004 from Rutgers University with honors in electrical and computer engineering. As a 2007 U.S.Army enlistee, he completed the Special Forces QualificationCourse and served as a Green Beret medic. On his last tour, inAfghanistan, he led a multinational assault team and earned aBronze Star as a casualty care instructor. Defining Teamwork Training Two weeks after his last military assign- ment, Lang matriculated at the med-ical school. That fall, he began volun- teer service at The Promise Clinic, a student- run project that provides primary care forlocal, medically underserved and uninsuredresidents. Four-member clinical teams arecomposed of one student from each yearwho follow the same patients throughoutmedical school. Assuming that health careteams would apply teamwork principlessimilar to those followed in the military,Lang was intrigued to find key differencesin the functioning of Promise Clinic teams.Team members did not convene before anappointment to agree upon goals, clarifyroles and responsibilities, or discuss contin- gency plans. In addition, \"debriefs\"\u2014meet- ings to identify areas for improvement dur-ing subsequent appointments\u2014were not the norm. In a clinical reflection for his \"Patient- Centered Medicine\" (PCM) course, Lang described the team- work of military aviation missions. \"The designated mission leader must hold a preflight briefing with all participating air- crew. They cover mission goals, roles and responsibilities, risk management, and contingency plans. After each mission, they hold a 'debrief' to review whether they accomplished mission objectives and identify areas for improvement,\" he wrote. \"These practices are likely as important in improving out-comes in medicine as they are in military aviation,\" Lang adds.\"Consequences of errors are similar, but instead of risk to yourown life as a pilot, it is a patient's life that may be at risk.\" Early on, Lang and Fitzpatrick compared impressions of their early clinical experiences and found that the behaviors they hadseen were not unique\u2014both had observed areas where betterteamwork and communication could have improved patientoutcomes. They wondered if incorporating lessons learned fromthe military might be beneficial in medical school teams. A Network of Champions Lang received a strongly supportive response to his reflec- tion from his PCM facilitator, Carol A. Terregino, MD '86,associate professor of medicine, senior associate dean for education and academic affairs, and associate dean for admis- sions. She responded that she had read his report \"with goosebumps,\" recognizing, \"in his Promise Clinic experience, a gapin the curriculum that had long been on my mind. Teamwork is not instinctive, and teamwork training could enhance produc- tivity and patient safety.\" She suggested that Lang andFitzpatrick build a network among students and faculty andbegin researching models of team training instruction thatmight be tailored to medical education. \"Things need tochange,\" she added. \"Perhaps your help and faculty supportcan be the answer to comprehensive curricular and culturalchange.\" Richard Lang '19 is a U.S. Naval Academy graduate and Pat Tillman Foundation Scholar with 12 years of active duty service as a Navy F/A-18 jet pilot and instructor at the Navy Fighter Weapons School (popularly called TOPGUN). JOHN EMERSONCOURTESY OF RICHARD LANG '19Dr. Terregino referred Lang and Fitzpatrick to acute care surgeon Gregory Peck, DO, assistant professor of surgery and director of trauma performance improvement. The collabora-tion was well timed: Dr. Peck had recently begun developinginternational, multidisciplinary teams to improve surgical ser-vices worldwide. Without hesitation, Dr. Peck agreed to joinDr. Terregino as a faculty co-adviser for the project. Meanwhile, the initiative had acquired its first \"student champions.\" Kristin N. Raphel '19, a former EMT field super-visor, and Thomas Kuriakose '19, a former high school teacherand coach, broadened the skill sets of the project leaders andshared the workload. The TeamSTEPPS Model and Master Training Researching the medical literature, the student project leaders discovered TeamSTEPPS (Team Strategies andTools to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety), an evidence-based program designed to optimize team perform- ance throughout the health care delivery system. While its pri-mary goal is increasing health care teamwork and communica-tion, its ultimate goal is the improvement of patient safety. TeamSTEPPS was developed by the nonprofit Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in conjunction with theDepartment of Defense, after fusing decades of data and bestpractices. The four project leaders chose TeamSTEPPS as themodel for their initiative, based on the goals of the program,the depth of research behind it, and the degree to which itreflected the student-veterans' experience. All four leaders completed the TeamSTEPPS master trainer course, qualifying them, in turn, to train their peers. They thendesigned a student-led TeamSTEPPS intervention for the cur-riculum. \"We hoped to provide fellow students with usableteamwork tools and strategies to improve patient care at everystage of their career,\" says Lang. Two-Phase Survey Brackets Team Training The leaders designed a two-phase survey that would pre- cede and then follow the TeamSTEPPS curricular interven-tion, providing the tools needed to assess current student teamwork behaviors and perceptions about teamwork in speci- fied courses. In addition, the post-intervention survey would provide students' observations about barriers to effective team- work. After approval by the Rutgers Institutional Review Board, the phase-one, pre-intervention survey was distributed to stu- dents throughout the medical school. It focused on three team- based settings: anatomy lab (M1s), interprofessional home vis- its (M2s), and Promise Clinic (students from all four years). Responses to the pre-intervention survey indicated that a 20RobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINEThe prior experience of our TeamSTEPPS leaders made them aspirational peers of all medical students, continually striving to advance medical educ a- tion to the end goal: ensuring quality care and safety for patients,\" EMERSONRobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINE 21 RobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINE 21A.

Raphel '19.22RobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINEmajority of medical students operating in team environments did not conduct routine briefs or debriefs. The survey alsofound that students strongly desired that teamwork training beintegrated into the curriculum\u2014with specific tools to helpthem become more effective team members. Following administration of the pre-intervention survey, the student leaders conducted the TeamSTEPPS training interven-tion in 90-minute, interactive sessions for 650 students. Withthe endorsement of the Curriculum Committee, the trainingwas integrated into the health sciences thread, where the pro-gram had found crucial early support. Integral to the trainingwas distribution of a single-page \"white coat pocket reference\"of TeamSTEPPS tools for the students. Responses to the post-intervention survey, taken about six months after the first survey, showed significant increases in the frequency of student briefings and debriefings, leadership behaviors, and student-perceived preparedness for team events. \"We went from the pre-intervention survey, where 60 percentof students reported that briefing 'sometimes or never' hap-pens, to the post-intervention response, in which 60 percentreported briefing 'always or most of the time,'\" says Lang.Student responses also helped to identify programmatic barri-ers: opportunities for improvement on subsequent curricularinterventions. An Unforeseen Champion and a New Leadership Team In 2018, soon after completion of the survey, the TeamSTEPPS project acquired an unforeseen new champion, when AndyAnderson, MD, was appointed chief executive officer of the Combined Medical Group of RWJBarnabas Health and Rutgers Health. Dr. Anderson previously served for seven yearsat the 15-hospital Aurora Health Care system, in Milwaukee. In leading a redesign of Aurora's primary care practices, Dr. Anderson had used TeamSTEPPS and found that the program'sflexibility makes it effective in settings from interprofessionaltraining to clinician skill development. Moreover, he says, itsteam-based approach leads to greater safety for patients andstaff. \"Let's meet and talk about how best to incorporate TeamSTEPPS into our practices,\" Dr. Anderson wrote to Lang.\"The students' positive energy encourages the kind of non-hierarchical bottom-up top-down culture we need,\" he added. The student team won the Association of American Medical Colleges' Northeast Group on Educational Affairs 2019Innovation in Medical Education Award. In addition, theyearned second place in the American Medical AssociationHealth Systems Science Student Impact Competition. As a result of their work on TeamSTEPPS, two of the pilot program leaders earned their medical degrees with distinction:Lang's in medical education and Raphel's in leadership in aca-demic health care. Lang will serve his residency in orthopedicsurgery at the Naval Medical Center San Diego, where helooks forward to continuing his work on TeamSTEPPS. BothRaphel and Fitzpatrick are pursuing residencies in emergencymedicine, while Kuriakose will serve his in pediatrics. \"The prior experience of our TeamSTEPPS leaders made them aspirational peers of all medical students, continuallystriving to advance medical education to the end goal: ensuringquality care and safety for patients,\" says Dr. Terregino. Although most of the pilot program leaders will graduate this year, a strong student base is ready to sustain the proj-ect's momentum. Stephanie Latham '21\u2014also a Pat TillmanFoundation Scholar and former Navy F/A-18 pilot\u2014hasworked with the group for two years. She will be leading agroup of other M1 and M2 students to further refineTeamSTEPPS training and expand its reach within the cur-riculum.

Alejandra Bolanos'22 : Full Four-Year Scholarship \"Means the World to Me\" On a study break for the first final exam of her first year at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Alejandra Bolanos '22 (above)decided to check her email. She discovered completely unexpectednews: the medical school had awarded her an annual$43,000 scholarship, covering her tuition for all four years.\"I couldn't believe my eyes,\" she says. \"I showed it to myfamily and asked everyone if they saw what I thought I'dseen.\" And, of course, they had. \"The scholarship was a welcome vote of confidence, and it means the world to me,\" adds Bolanos. \"It means thatpeople besides my family and friends see my potential, andthat I was chosen for a reason. It means that I can continueto focus all of my time and energy on learning and becom-ing the best physician I can be without the added pressureof how much student debt I will have upon graduation.\"A native of Colombia, Bolanos became interested in med- icine while accompanying her mother to checkups, servingas a linguistic interpreter and facilitating physician-patientinteractions. The experience inclined her toward familymedicine, and the scholarship will help her realize that goal.\"It means that I can go into whatever specialty I desirewithout having to consider the financial aspect. It's a giantweight lifted off my shoulders,\" she says. Bolanos completed her premed requirements as a biology major at Monmouth University, in West Long Branch.While at Monmouth, she took advantage of a shadowingprogram at Monmouth Medical Center, offered by the uni-versity. In addition, she independently found a summer pro-gram at Weill Cornell Medical Center, in New York, whichprovided insights into clinical and research opportunities. RobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINE 25Also on her own, she arranged for shadowing opportuni- ties, first with her mother's doctor and then with an osteopath in family practice. \"He demonstrated the impor-tance [in osteopathy] of touch in physician-patient interac-tion and its importance in localizing and diagnosing a prob-lem,\" she says. \"I liked that, and I liked the age range of hispatients, from babies to adults.\" During the three years after graduation, Bolanos worked as a technician in two medical practices\u2014a retinal ophthal-mologist and a dermatologist\u2014gaining hands-on patientcare experience and solidifying her decision to apply tomedical school. After her interview at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, she had no doubt that it would be her first choice.\"I loved everything about it\u2014every interactionwas friendly and welcoming,\" she says. Bolanos got off to a strong start academically. At the same time, she found opportunities togive back, volunteering at The Promise Clinic asa student doctor and interpreter. She is alsoactive in the Latino Medical Students Associ-ation and was elected vice president of thegroup during her first semester. The donor of the scholarship has been delighted to get together with Bolanos on sever-al occasions. Bolanos shares that feeling. \"Itwas great to meet my donor\u2014a truly relatable,friendly, and wonderful person,\" she says.\"We've forged a bond, and I'm happy that I'mable to demonstrate my appreciation Family Scholarship Rosanne and Ronald Nahass' ties to Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and Rutgers University stretch back almost 40 years.In 1980, Ronald Nahass, MD '82, then in histhird year of medical school, met first-year stu-dent Rosanne Vita; by the end of her secondyear, they were celebrating their marriage as well as hisgraduation. Both completed their residencies in internal medicine at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, where Ron alsocompleted a fellowship in infectious diseases. Since 1986,he has almost continuously served on the clinical faculty. APhi Beta Kappa graduate of Rutgers University, RosanneVita Nahass, MD '84, majored in piano performance. Afterpracticing as an internist for 18 years, she rediscovered herlove for the piano and left medical practice to perform andlecture\u2014often at the Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers,where she was pianist in residence. The couple's two youngest children, Meghan Nahass, MD '16, who is married to classmate Louis Chai, MD '16,and Thomas Nahass, MD '17, are among the medicalschool's newest alumni. Their older brother, Ronald, fol-lowed a different path, going into finance. He is the fatherof the Nahasses' two grandchildren\u2014\"perhaps our greatestachievement,\" his father says. Ron and Rosanne Nahass (above) are longtime donors to the medical school, but with their children's schooling com-plete, they agreed that \"it was of great importance to dosomething a bit more enduring,\" he says. \"As a Jersey girland boy, we wanted to support a local institution and helpChancellor's Chal lenge JOHN EMERSONstudents with the high cost of medical school.\" The Chancellor's Scholarship Challenge offered a perfect opportunity to do exactly that, leveraging their gift to multiply the base amount of their endowment. The criteria for the scholarships provided by their endowment are flexible, but they also reflect the Nahasses' own backgrounds and strengths, showing \"achievementor interests in the arts, sciences, humanities or technologythat demonstrate dedication, innovation or excellence.\" They hope that by establishing the Nahass Family Endowment, they have created a vehicle that will inspiretheir children to sustain their vision long into the future.\"We are proud of New Jersey. There are so many excellentpeople here, and our family has had such a positive expe-rience at the medical school,\" says Ron Nahass. \"By doingour small part, we hope we have provided a base that willhelp make our state competitive in attracting the best stu-dents and keeping high-quality doctors here in our state.\" Alumni Association Endows $50,000 Scholarship Fund With a unanimous \"yea,\" the board of the RobertWood Johnson Medical School Alumni Associa- tion voted in September 2018 toestablish the first scholarship endow-ment in the organization's history. Thevote followed a proposal by TreasurerHank Lubin, MD '83, to create a newscholarship, knowing its impact wouldbe doubled by Chancellor BrianStrom's Scholarship Challenge, whichwas set to culminate on Dec 31. \"We had an exciting discussion leading up to the vote, with everyone taking part,\" says Paul F. Weber, MD '87, RPh, MBA, then president of the association. \"We set three goals: first, to qualify for the challenge; second, to address our mounting concern over students' ability to afford tuition; and third, to have a long-term impact on the school.\" The board debated two options in particular: whether to make a one-time $25,000 gift that would be matched by the challenge, or to leverage thematch amount to establish a $50,000 scholarship endow-ment. Ultimately, the board members' vote for the endow-ment resulted not only from their confidence in its long-term impact, but also from their vision of a growing bodyof alumni engaged in supporting the fund for years tocome. The annual payout from the fund will depend onmany economic factors, but Dr. Lubin estimates that astarting balance of $50,000 might provide $2,500 in thefirst year. Future gifts to the endowment will build the bal-ance and allow for larger scholarships. The Alumni Association will continue its long tradition of offering students loans at a minimal2 to 3 percent interest, while also con-tributing to scholarships and support-ing programs such as Career Night. Deborah Saez-Lacy, MD '86, associ- ation vice president, believes that theopportunity to make a gift that is 100percent designated for scholarship sup- port will motivate alumni to becomedonors. \"Alumni understand the bur- den of student debt,\" she says. \"It canbe a constant concern, and the prospectof loan payments influences students'perspective on career choices.\" Dr. Weber first joined the associa- tion board in 1992; Dr. Lubin has beena board member since 1983 and hasserved as treasurer since 2007, when the position was created; and Dr. Saez-Lacy was able to increase her partici- pation four years ago as her OB/GYN practice sloweddown. Elena Frid, MD '06, joined the board several yearsago, eager to be more involved in the medical school, and amere three years later, she succeeded Dr. Weber as president. As a student, Dr. Frid looked forward to the association's annual Career Night. In fact, one year, after speaking withalumni representing neurology, she realized she had discov-ered her career path. \"Our student ambassadors play anintegrative role on the board and were very important tothis discussion,\" says Dr. Frid. \"We are pleased to serve asa resource for them, and they keep us in touch with the day-to-day student life.\" \"All the alumni on the board are very involved with the school,\" says Dr. Saez-Lacy. \"We're very lenge Hank Lubin, MD '83COURTESY OF MEDICINE PRINCETON HEALTH Paul F .

B Y K AT E O ' N E I L L P O RT R A I T S B Y J O H N E M E R S O N28RobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINEFor Dr. Brant, one of those changes of direction came in the spring of 2017, when he was offered the opportunity to serve as a division chief at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson MedicalSchool. He had spent 25 years on the faculty at the JohnsHopkins University School of Medicine and was in his eighthyear as director of the school's Meyerhoff Inflammatory BowelDisease Center. Rutgers offered Dr. Brant a compelling option:the chance to build a new program\u2014an exciting challenge at avery successful stage of his career. Dr. Brant brought to Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences his extraordinary record in research and deep dedication to caring for patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease(IBD). He also is an adjunct professor at the Human GeneticsInstitute of New Jersey at Rutgers University and at RutgersCancer Institute of New Jersey. Specialty Care at the Crohn's and Colitis Center of New Jersey While leading the gastroenterology division and building on its many existing strengths, Dr. Brant serves as asso- ciate director of the Rutgers Health Crohn's and Colitis Centerof New Jersey, a multidisciplinary regional referral center thatoffers diagnosis and expert, comprehensive care. The centerhas both a pediatric and an adult component, each on a sepa-rate floor, and a clinic where Dr. Brant sees patients twice aweek. \"It's my favorite part of my job,\" he says. \"At JohnsHopkins, I had some patients I'd been seeing for 25 years. Imiss them, but I'm already making new relationships here.\" Nearly 1.5 million people in the United States suffer from IBD, which is also common and increasing worldwide. Mostfrequently, the disease is first diagnosed in young adults; how-ever, young children represent 12 to 15 percent of the patientsatthe center, where they are cared for by pediatric gastrointesti-nal (GI) specialists. Dr. Brant recalls that his personal concernfor people with IBD began in junior high school, where he had a good friend who suffered from Crohn's disease. Thankfully, his friend's disease is under control, and he is doing well. The IBD umbrella covers a variety of chronic diseases, in- cluding Crohn's and ulcerative colitis. Although their symptoms are similar\u2014including persistent diarrhea, abdominal pain,rectal bleeding and bloody stools, weight loss, malnutrition, and fatigue\u2014in Crohn's disease, any portion of the digestive tract may be inflamed, whereas in ulcerative colitis, inflamma- tion is confined to the large intestine and rectum. IBD stems from a complex interplay of genetic and environ- mental factors that cause the immune system to have an uncon- trolled inflammatory response in the intestinal tissues. Dr. Brant surmises that genes that once mutated to protect us from in-fection may have become dysregulated, developing a damagingautoimmune response in today's relatively sterile environment. The goal of treatment is to achieve and retain remission, restore quality of life, and minimize complications, includingthose that require removal of portions of the small intestine orcolon. Patients are also at increased risk for small bowel orcolon cancer. Immunosuppressants\u2014comparable to medica-tions that prevent rejection of a transplanted organ\u2014have beenwidely successful in controlling symptoms. The use of immune-modifying agents, however, requires a delicate balance: immunesuppression, while preventing flare-ups and disease progres-sion, can leave the patient vulnerable to infection. IBD: Commitment, Support, and Discovery As an undergraduate at Brandeis University, Dr. Brant stud- ied enzyme function in the laboratory of the renowned biochemist William Jencks, MD. A North Miami Beach native, Dr. Brant earned his medical degree at the University of Florida.He completed his residency at Indiana University Medical Center,following Dr. Jencks' advice to specialize in internal medicine,allowing him to balance his interests in patient care and research. Subsequently, as a gastroenterology fellow at Johns Hopkins University, he worked in the laboratory of gastroenterologistMark Donowitz, MD, doing epithelial biology research. Duringthis time, he discovered and cloned the NHE3 gene, a key regu-lator of sodium absorption in the digestive tract. Later, working with Theodore Bayless, MD, his clinical men- tor in IBD at Johns Hopkins, Dr. Brant used similar approaches RobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINE 29to map the location of genes responsible for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, investigating families affected with IBD.He also collaborated with Judy Cho, MD, then at the Univer-sity of Chicago. Their research led to the identification ofNOD2 as the first gene causing a risk for Crohn's disease.NOD2 helps immune cells and cells within the lining of thesmall intestines detect and respond to bacterial invasion. Soon thereafter, Dr. Brant identified NFKB1, a master regula- tory gene of inflammatory response, as a gene associated with ulcerative colitis. These and other discoveries paved the way for the identification of numerous\u2014now more than 200\u2014addition- al genes that play a role in IBD. \"Doing research on genetics, you get an exhilarating feeling that you may be the first person on earth to discover the natureof a human disease,\" says Dr. Brant. \"But that understanding extends only so far. Next you have to piece together a multilay- ered puzzle, maybe looking for bacteria that interact with the gene, and solving the mystery of why people get this disease.\" Since 2002, Dr. Brant has received continuous funding from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and KidneyDiseases (NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health(NIH). The first award, $1.25 million, established the center atJohns Hopkins that focused on the genetics of IBD. In 2007 hereceived a $2.4 million, five-year renewal, bringing the total to$8.4 million. When Dr. Brant's grant followed him to Rutgers, the Crohn's and Colitis Center of New Jersey became one of six centers inthe NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC); it is also a col-laborating center of the International IBDGC. The center atRutgers will continue to work with faculty at Johns Hopkins,and Dr. Brant has begun to involve additional researchers fromRutgers New Jersey Medical School. When the center at Johns Hopkins was established, extensive genetic studies of IBD had been done among people ofEuropean ancestry. But none focused on African Americans,among whom the disease had become increasingly common. Dr.Brant chose to apply the NIH grant to an in-depth geneticanalysis of IBD in African Americans, who are descendents ofthe oldest civilization centers on earth and have one of the mostdiverse human genomes. Subsequent research was rewarded by the discovery of mul- tiple genetic variants associated with ulcerative colitis that wereexclusive to patients with African ancestry. Reinvigorating the GI Program For Dr. Brant, one of the principal attractions of coming toRutgers was the opportunity to recruit new faculty and reinvigorate the GI program. He is as pleased to be workingwith long-term faculty\u2014including the former division chief,Kiron Das, MD, PhD, professor of medicine\u2014as he is with hisfive new recruits, whose expertise ranges from pharmacologyto therapeutic endoscopy. Dr. Brant is a sought-after mentor to fellows and new facul- ty. Gastroenterologist Ruby Greywoode, MD, assistant profes-sor of medicine, joined the division in the summer of 2018, fol-lowing a fellowship at Mount Sinai Hospital, in New York.Primarily a clinician, she was familiar with Dr. Brant's work withthe consortium, and his study of IBD in the African Americanpopulation made the program feel like a good fit for her. \"His door is always open,\" says Dr. Greywoode, grateful to Dr. Brant for enhancing her first faculty experience by demon-strating the value of her contributions to the group. As he recruits outstanding faculty and young researchers, meets new patients, and pursues his fascination with the genet-ics of IBD, Dr. Brant is confident that his midcareer course cor-rection was on target. And although he left the Chesapeake Bayand his 24-foot sloop behind in Maryland, he looks forward toindulging his passion for sailing along and beyond the waters ofRaritan Bay. MMDoing research on genetics, you get an exhilarating feeling that you may be the first person on earth to discover the nature of a humandisease,\" says Steven R.

Educating patients like Varghese in the South Asian community, helping physicians recognize problemsendemic to those from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh,Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bhutan, and conductingresearch into this population's health issues is whySunanda Gaur, MD, professor of pediatrics at RutgersRobert Wood Johnson Medical School and director ofSATHI, helped create the initiative at the medicalschool in 2007. \"There are a number of health issues from which the community suffers, particularly cardiovascular,diabetes, and mental health, and also cancer,\" explainsDr. Gaur. \"The problem is that a lot of South Asians haveimmigrated to this area [Middlesex County], and there are notmany health programs directed at them and their more Easternways of thinking about health and practicing health care.\" One of the significant health concerns in the community is a lack of preventive care. While South Asians will visit doctorswhen sick, they tend not to practice preventive care becauseprophylactic tests such as colonoscopies or mammograms arenot yet part of the culture. Educating Physicians Is Key Physicians are not always aware of the health risks that are more common among South Asians, in part because of insufficient studies. The paucity of research means a lack of knowledge for treating patients. Once research-based evi- dence is found and disseminated, it moves from researchers to practitioners to patients. Eventually, those findings becomeenmeshed in health care. For example, when a woman undergoes a routine mammo- gram, a standard question is if she is of Ashkenazi descent, since that Jewish population runs a higher risk for breast can-cer. The query is on a standard form for everyone, despitefocusing on the small minority affected. For the South Asian community, such warning flags are not yet raised. \"We know that for South Asians, mortality and morbidity set in 10 years earlier,\" Dr. Gaur says. \"Why? We don't know.That research is lacking; even though we start prevention pro-grams, they are not informed by research.\" With approximately 200,000 South Asian residents, New Jersey experienced a population surge of 133 percent in a 20-year period, based on the 2010 census. Despite such numbers,there remains a lack of understanding on both sides. Amongphysicians, there is an absence of the usual data; among manySouth Asians, there remains a stigma about seeking help forailments such as mental illness and physical and behavioraldisabilities. \"South Asians are at very high risk for different health issues\u2014metabolic syndrome, diabetes, heart disease, and car-diovascular disease,\" says Usha Ramachandran, MD, assistantprofessor of pediatrics and associate director of SATHI. \"Weare at high risk for these problems even when not obese by the \"My dream would be to get more funding so we could turn SATHI into a center, and engage in more research directed toward the health issues in this community, \" says Dr. Gaur.RobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINE 33general definition. Health care providers need to be more aware, and there needs to be more effort to address these risks.\" Research Is Needed While studies are conducted in India and other SouthAsian countries, Dr. Ramachandran stresses the impor- tance of research in the United States, because lifestyles anddiets are different. In its quest to educate the public, SATHI partners with com- munity-based organizations and meets in temples and othercommunity venues, where nutritional information and otherhealth care concerns are discussed. It's vital to begin healthfulnutrition as soon as possible, and SATHI is participating in aresearch project funded by the National Institutes of Health onhow babies between 6 and 18 months old are fed. This research, which aims to reduce common risk factors for obesity and caries in South Asian babies, is in conjunction withAlbert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. SATHI is also working on a project to study tuberculosis (TB), in collaboration with Saint Peter's University Hospital, inNew Brunswick. They have completed a large survey of theSouth Asian population to learn people's views on TB and whythey don't access treatment, and the group is entering the secondphase\u2014education of the community, Dr. Gaur notes. Making a Difference on the Grassroots Level Teaching people through creative outreach programs remains a hallmark of SATHI. Topics tackled at SATHI events have included stroke, TB, HIV, and nutrition, saysBishakha Ghoshal, MPH, the initiative's coordinator, who hadbeen a physician in India and earned her master's degree inpublic health at Rutgers University. The events usually includelunch, and SATHI works with a dietitian who creates healthfulalternatives to traditional dishes. \"The first was a healthy sugar for gajar halwa, which is a car- rot mishmash with butter. It is cooked in Indian homes for holi- days, and it is super unhealthy. Instead of clarified butter, a die- titian used olive oil, and instead of sugar she used honey,\" says Ghoshal. Over the years, SATHI's work has included educating South Asians about the risks of stroke, cancer, childhood obesity, and HIV, as well as discussions on healthy pregnancies. Through awebsite, Facebook page, and outreach to community groups,SATHI continues to grow its presence. It sets up tables athealth fairs a few times a year and tries to hold events monthly in temples. Among the innovative methods SATHI employs to improvehealth is introducing easy ways to exercise. Dr. Gaur notes,\"People don't usually engage in going to the gym and exercis-ing very much.\" To counter a sedentary lifestyle, SATHI hasshowcased unusual, and intentionally not strenuous, activities,such as laughter yoga to combat hypertension, shoulder relax-ation, and walks. Since SATHI holds many community out-reach programs in Hindu temples, it is working out a methodof demarcating paths for worshippers to use while circlingdeities so that a mile is completed when the worshipper circlesthe deity the customary 108 times; each circumambulation isbelieved to cleanse sins. Reaching Out to Other Medical Professionals In addition to the community, SATHI strives to work with fellow health care professionals. Among those efforts was an October 2010 conference from which SATHI generated areport,Addressing Health Disparities and Health Literacy Challenges in the South Asian Community , which notes that as many as 40 percent of South Asians may not have a regularsource of health care. Another striking statistic is that \"preva-lence, hospitalization, morbidity and mortality from coronaryartery disease among South Asians are 50 to 300 percent higherthan in Europeans and Americans.\" A second conference, in April 2013, focused on maternal and child health issues in clinical practices for South Asian families.According to Robert C. Like, MD, MS, professor of family med-icine and community health, and director, Center for HealthyFamilies and Cultural Diversity, \"The importance of educatinghealth care professionals and learners in the provision of cultur-ally and linguistically appropriate services was emphasized dur-ing the conferences.\" SATHI collaborates with the South Asian Studies Program at Rutgers, presenting series at which experts discuss social, cultur-al, and environmental determinants of health in the South Asiancommunity. SATHI works diligently at getting its messageheard, such as partnering with EBC Radio, a South Asian radiostation in central New Jersey; some shows have been listened toby as many as 15,000 people, Ghoshal says. This groundswell of popularity encourages those working on the initiative as they apply for additional grants, work on stud-ies, and remain committed to their goal of helping South Asiansbecome healthier. Neither Dr. Gaur nor Dr. Ramachandranappears daunted by the tasks before them. \"My goal would be to grow it further,\" Dr. Gaur says. \"My dream would be to get more funding so we could turn it into acenter, and engage in more research directed toward the healthissues in this community.\" MMR W J M SNEWS 34RobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINEThe 9th Annual Scholar- ship Gala, on April 6 at the Heldrich in New Brunswick, grossed morethan $210,000 for studentscholarships.

Goldstein and his wife, Barbara, were walking back to their New York City apartment between Yom Kippur services when he doubled over with an excruci- ating stomachache. After returning to their apartment and quickly real-izing that a traditional stomach remedy would not work, they took acab to NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, where the renowned gastroen-terologist Michel Kahaleh, MD , diagnosed him with acute pancreatitis, caused by a blockage in his pancreatic duct. Facing a life-threateningcondition, Goldstein put his faith that day in Dr. Kahaleh, who operatedand removed the blockage. Goldstein's recovery was not easy, requiring a weeklong stay in the intensive care unit followed by several more weeks in the hospital. He couldn't eat ordrink anything fora few more monthsafter that, to allowhis pancreas toheal. Goldstein, now 83 and still putting in full days as president of SMP Asset Management, an investment firmhe founded in 1982, credits Dr. Kahaleh with saving his life. In early2018, Dr. Kahaleh joined the faculty of Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School as distinguished professor of medicine, clinical director of gastroenterology, and chief of endoscopy. While recovering from the surgery, Goldstein learned about Dr. Kahaleh's research on minimally invasive procedures to treat bowel andpancreatic disorders. Their conversations spurred the Goldsteins topledge $1 million to establish the Edna and Charles Goldstein ResearchFund, in memory of Lawrence's parents, to support Dr. Kahaleh'sresearch at the medical school. \"Barbara and I wanted to help himachieve his research goals,\" Lawrence Goldstein says. One procedure Dr. Kahaleh hopes to improve is endoscopic ultra- sound, which allows a doctor to view the digestive tract from inside thepatient and remove lesions or obstructions, eliminating the need forinvasive surgery. Such procedures benefit patients by lowering the riskof infection, reducing pain and scarring, cutting health care costs, anddecreasing the time patients spend in hospitals. \"Patients undergoing less invasive procedures heal faster,\" Dr. Kahaleh says. \"If we can meet patient demand for minimally invasiveinterventions while reducing health care costs, it's a home run.\" \u2014Originally published by the Rutgers University Foundation.

Mackenzie, MD, Endowed Chair inSurgery, and Shaohua Li, MD , assistant professor of surgery, has taken animportant step toward the goal of making diseased hearts heal them-selves\u2014a new modelthat would reducethe need for bypasssurgery, heart trans-plants, or artificialpumping devices. The pub- lished Cell involvedremoving heart,reverse-engineeringthem them into heartmuscle cells. Theteam's true break-through, however, is that the newly created cardiac muscle cells clumpedtogether into a single unit that visiblypumped under the microscope. Dr. Lee, who is senior author of the study, said cardiac cells made in this waydon't normally come together and beatas one. His team succeeded in makingthis happen by overexpressing a proteinin the cells called CREG. According toDr. Lee, fibroblasts, particular cells inconnective tissue, were isolated from theheart tissue and reverse-engineered fortransformation into stem cells. This wasdone so that when the CREG proteinwas overexpressed, the stem cells woulddifferentiate into cardiac cells.

A leading scientist in the field of molecular biologyand biochemistry, Dr.Inouye joined the medicalschool in 1987 as professorand chair, Department ofBiochemistry, a position heheld until 2007. In 2008,he was appointed distin-guished professor. He has made a number of important discoveries inlife science. His pioneeringcontributions are represent-ed by his more than 650publications. His researchhas led to significantadvances in the fields ofprotein folding, bacterialstress response, and generegulation. Most notably, in 1984 Dr. Inouye discovered anew principle of gene regu-lation by RNA, whichopened an unprecedentedavenue for engineeringgene expression from bacteria to humans. Inaddition, he made anotherimportant discovery thatgene expression can be regulated by protein-basedmRNA interference byenzymes, destroyingspecific mRNAs in living cells. This findinghas had a significantimpact on the develop-ment of therapeuticmethods for cancer andAIDS. Dr. Inouye is one of a select group of 2,347 activemembers of the NationalAcademy of Sciences.

The study focused on a fatty acid derivative of the neurotransmitterserotonin, called EHT (Eicosanoyl-5-hydroxytryptamide), that is found in the coffee bean's waxy coating.The researchers found that EHTprotects the protein accumulationassociated with Parkinson's diseaseand Lewy body dementia. Dr.Mouradian's team gave mice small doses of caffeine or EHTseparately as well as togeth-er. Each compound alonewas not effective, but whengiven together the two compounds boosted theactivity of a catalyst that helps prevent the accumula-tion of harmful proteins in the brain. This suggests that the combina- tion of EHT and caffeine may beable to slow or stop the progres-sion of these diseases.

I have served on the board the past four years, and am looking forward to continuing to build our alumni activities and strengthen the bondbetween our alma mater and allits alumni. Among my goals are to help connect alumni with similar inter- ests and offer more opportunities for social activities, as well as raise more funds for students. Check ouralumni website (rwjms.rutgers.edu/alumni) , follow us on Facebook (@RWJmedicalschool) and Instagram (@RWJMS) , and update your email address to make sure you are receiving special alumni communications and invitations to these events. I am proud to report that so far this year, alumni have participated in numerous activities at the school. The Annual Career Night, on March 5, brought together more than 65 alumni who returned to the Great Hall toshare their career paths with students and reconnect with their classmates. Alumni interested in further men-toring students can sign up for the alumni-student mentorship program , found at the alumni website.

Then an opportu-nity arose to work in pediatric drugdevelopment,\" Dr. Desai says. \"Eachexperience has been amazing and agreat learning opportunity. There areso many opportunities in medicine. Ithink it's important to develop newskills and keep learning.\" It was while studying at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School withSoula G. Koniaris, MD, MS, nowassistant professor of pediatrics andchief, division of pediatric gastroen-terology, and Susan Rosenthal, MMS'75, MD, now clinical professor ofpediatrics, that Dr. Desai becameinterested in pediatric gastroenterolo-gy. That interest became a careerdirection when he did his residency ingeneral pediatrics at St. Christopher'sHospital for Children in Philadelphia.Afterward, when he did his fellowshipwork at Boston Children's Hospital,he conducted research in lipid metab-olism. Work on obesity and fatty liverdisease, as well as the study of pedi-atric dyslipidemia, followed. After hisfellowship, he worked with Sarah deFerranti, MD, MPH, chief, division ofcardiology outpatient services, and director, preventive cardiology, at Boston Children's Hospital; he beganresearch projects regarding the effectsof statin therapy on liver enzymes inchildren and became interested in rarecauses of pediatric lipid disorders. In 2013, Dr. Desai became medical director of the adolescent bariatricsurgery program at Boston Children'sHospital. \"This was a fascinatingpopulation of patients,\" he says. \"Itwas We were help-ing those with fatty liver disease, ele-vated lipid levels, and other complica-tions of obesity.\" The programemphasizes safe and effective weightloss, addressing the medical, surgical,nutritional, emotional, and socialneeds of children who are candidates. Dr. Desai is also passionate about correcting the misperception that chil-dren and bariatric surgery don't mix.This is a medically complex need thatin many ways mirrors that of adults.Many pediatric patients have tried tolose weight but haven't been success-ful. \"Aside from their medical issues,patients have significant psychosocialcomorbidities\u2014patients suffer fromdepression and anxiety, are teased bytheir peers, don't have large supportnetworks, and need someone they cantrust on their side,\" Dr. Desai says.\"They benefit from this comprehen- urrently serving as a global clinical develop- ment lead at the pharmaceutical company Shire, Nirav Desai, MD '05, has made some unconventional careerchoices since he received his medical degree fromRobert Wood Johnson Medical School. Following hisinstincts and pursuing different opportunities as theypresented themselves make for a very interesting CV.

In the United States,according to the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention, the percent-age of children and adolescents affect-ed by obesity has more than tripledsince the 1970s. Data from 2015 to2016 show that nearly one in fiveschool-age children and young people(6 to 19 years old) in this country hasobesity. Teens who are accepted into the Boston Children's Hospital programmust have a body mass index of atleast 35; most have a BMI greaterthan 40 and are well over the 95thpercentile in their weight class. Priorto surgery, a multidisciplinary teammeets with patients to give them regu-lar nutritional, social work, and med-ical counseling assistance. Patientsalso connect with other specialists during the process. The vast majorityof the patients in the program lose atleast 50 percent of their excess weightpost-surgery and improve or resolvemedical comorbidities such as sleepapnea and high cholesterol.Dr. Desai maintains his clinical in- volvement in the adolescent bariatricsurgery program. In fact, he has estab-lished a mentorship with medical stu-dents at Boston Children's Hospital.He is especially passionate about get-ting the word to community physi-cians about the impact of weight-losssurgery on certain patients with severeobesity. \u2014Continued on page 50 STEVE HOCKSTEIN \"My experience in medical school gave me a window into the diversity of the field and the many ways you can impact a child's life,\" says Nirav Desai, MD '05, whosepassion for this specialty was ignited when he was a student at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.44RobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINEA L U M N I P R O F I L E Vera Bennett, MD '91: Advocating for Mothers and Babies in the White Mountains of Arizona My philosophy is to take advan- tage of every opportunity that you have to learn, because the moreyou learn, the more you can offeryour patients,\" Dr. Bennett explains. It was her drive to learn more that propelled her toward a specializationin breastfeeding medicine. When shehad her first child, Jacob, during herpediatric residency in 1993, she hadtrouble breastfeeding. Despite her clinical education, she had little instruction on how to breastfeed. \"He didn't latch well and was cranky,\" says Dr. Bennett. \"Despitebeing told 'breast was best,' I receivedvery little education about how to doit\u2014either as a patient or as a resi-dent.\"Becoming an Expert\u2014and Advocate\u2014in BreastfeedingMedicine Determined to provide the best for her baby, Dr. Bennett called the La Leche League to learn all that shecould about proper breastfeeding tech-niques. In 1998, she became certified by the International Board of Lactation Consultant Examiners. Now Dr.Bennett is a national expert in breast-feeding medicine, a field that encom- passes every facet of breastfeeding, from treating mastitis, clogged milk ducts, and yeast infections, to counsel-ing mothers on breastfeeding tech- niques and what medications they can take while breastfeeding. \"I became an expert in the field because there wasn't anyone else whowas,\" Dr. Bennett says.As a mother of four, Dr. Bennett recalls breastfeeding her childrenwherever she needed to: atDisneyland, Cub Scout meetings, evenat her mother's funeral. Fittingly, she'san advocate for providing safe, cleanplaces for women to breastfeed orpump breast milk. Coupled with herbelief in the benefits of breastfeedingis compassion for those who aren'table to or choose not to, for a varietyof reasons: \"I'm an advocate forbreastfeeding, but I'm not going to tella woman that formula is poison. Wecan't sit in an ivory tower; we must beaware of the realities of other people'ssituations. Ultimately, the goal is tofeed the baby, so I support every momin her decision on how to do that.\" Dr. Bennett's path to personal and professional fulfillment has not beenwithout its trials. An alcoholic in re-covery, she relished the opportunityfor a change when presented with anoffer in 2011 to take over a hospital-owned practice of a retiring pediatri-cian in the White Mountains ofArizona. Four years later, she openedPediatric MultiCare West, specializingin breastfeeding medicine and treat-era Bennett, MD '91, is a Renaissance woman. A board-certified pediatrician, she's also an actress, scuba diver, livestock farmer, and soap maker, among other talents. Each interest stokes the fire of her curiosity,enabling her to grow personally and professionally.V B Y J O D I MCC A F F R E Y\"RobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINE 45ment for children with \"high needs,\" such as autism. As with breastfeeding, Dr. Bennett's expertise in this area developed froma personal need: her third son wasborn with autism. To learn more about the condition, she read journalarticles and attended industry confer-ences. In rural Arizona, her expertiseis what sets her practice apart,often attracting patients from two or three hours away. \"Neurological issues are com- plex and challenging to understand,\"Dr. Bennett explains. \"I'm not willing to cut corners. I give my best to everypatient who walks in my door.\" In the White Mountains, which are about three hours from Phoenix bycar, many children are raised bygrandparents or are in foster care. Thepoverty rate is high, with many livingwithout running water, electricity, orproper nutrition. With a large numberof Native Americans and a smallamount of resources, Dr. Bennettoften makes complicated diagnosesbased on a mixture of intuition andintellect. This ability, she says, is oneof the ways that Robert WoodJohnson Medical School prepared herfor private practice. \"The physicians who trained us gave us a lot of autonomy,\" Dr. Bennett \u2014Continued on page 50 PHOTOS COURTESY OF VERA BENNETT, MD '91 Vera Bennett, MD '91, is a national expert in breastfeeding medicine.\"I became an expert in the field because there wasn't anyone else who was,\" she says.Dr. Grotas served his surgical internship and his residency in adult and pediatric urology at BethIsrael Medical Center in New York.Today, he serves as an assistant pro-fessor of urology at what is nowMount Sinai Beth Israel, where hepractices general urology and has asubspecialty practice in transgendermedicine. As a medical student, Dr. Grotas found an ideal faculty mentor in pedi-atric urologist Joseph G. Barone, MD'87, MBA. In his fourth year, Dr.Grotas coauthored two papers withDr. Barone, who now serves as profes-sor of surgery, and chief, division ofpediatric urology, at the medicalschool, and The Bristol-Myers SquibbChildren's Hospital at Robert WoodJohnson University Hospital. Dr. Grotas continues to publish, presenting multiple abstracts and writing numerous articles and bookchapters, the most recent concerningmale and female sexual dysfunction.\"Transgender surgery actually has itsroots in pediatric urology, wheremany of our reconstructive techniqueswere used to correct birth defects, forexample,\" says Dr. Grotas. As a resident, Dr. Grotas saw andtreated LGBT patients, recognizingtheir personal and medical challenges.At time when transgender women(male-to-female) had difficulty find-ing a urologist who would and couldprovide specialized treatment, Dr.Grotas became known as open, com-passionate, and highly competent.\"Robert Wood Johnson MedicalSchool is rooted in primary care andfamily medicine, and, true to thoseroots, they taught us to care for thewhole patient,\" he says. \"Transgender issues were not dis- cussed when I was in medical school,however,\" he adds. \"Learning theendocrinology and reconstructivetechniques available to transgenderpatients has allowed me to extendgreat care to patients who just wantto be respected like everyone else.\" In 2012, Dr. Grotas was on the team of four who founded the multi-specialty center for LGBT health serv-ices at Beth Israel Medical Center.Later, the center evolved as the MountSinai Center for Transgender Medicineand Surgery (CTMS), with a team of23 specialists providing comprehen-sive, integrated health care for trans-gender Transgender SurgeryA L U M N I P R O F I L E he Grotas family forms an alumni trifecta: Jay Grotas, MD, graduated from then Rutgers Medical School in 1974. His sons, Jason and Aaron, graduated from Robert WoodJohnson Medical School in 2000 and 2002, respectively.Following in their father's footsteps, both chose to specialize inurology, enjoying the diversity of a field that Aaron Grotascalls \"the perfect marriage of medicine and surgery,\" serving abroad spectrum of patients, male and female, throughout theirlives.T B Y K A T E O ' N E I L LRobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINE 47the founding and development of the center,\" says Barbara Warren, PsyD, director, LGBT Programs and Policies, Office for Diversity and Inclusion, Mount Sinai Health System, who worked on the center's founding team with Dr. Grotas. Gender-reassignment surgery usedto be provided primarily at private hospitals and clinics. One of a fewpioneers nationwide in this field, CTMS was the first center of its kindin New York State, where insurancecovers transgender medicine. More-over, Mount Sinai is a leading teach-ing hospital affiliated with a majormedical school, where high-qualitycare is provided in keeping with thestandards of all surgical procedures. Patients from throughout the world come to the center for top-level sub-specialty care across the medical disci-plines\u2014primary and specialty care,surgical behavioralhealth care\u2014in a transgender-affirma-tive setting. \"Many of today's patientshave waited years to decide on sur-gery,\" says Dr. Grotas. \"And as thepopularity of gender reassignmentsurgery increases, and proceduresbecome safer, it creates overwhelmingdemand.\" By combining techniques of urolo- gy and plastic surgery, Dr. Grotas cre-ates novel approaches to gender-affirming surgery. A transgender man(female-to-male) might elect to have ametoidioplasty, known as \"meta,\"which entails extending the urethraand constructing a penis that makes itpossible to urinate from a standingposition. Phalloplasty, described by Dr. Grotas as \"the holy grail of sex reassignmentsurgery,\" involves construction of a fullpenis and is both more complex thana\"meta\" and more expensive.

COURTESY OF AARON GROTAS, MD '0248RobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINEAs assistant dean of medical educa- tion for instructional design and development at Boston University School of Medicine, Dr. Cohen-Osherwants medical schools to examinehow they teach and how those lessonsare measured. She wants emphasisput on early clinical exposure and onreenvisioning the role of the medical student on the clinical team. \"If we really want to create the doctors we desire, we need to thinkdeliberately about how to do that,\"says Dr. Cohen-Osher. \"Sometimeswe are not quite teaching and assess-ing the right thing. So yes, we knowdoctors can take tests and put a lot ofinformation in their heads, but beingable to research on the internet is agame changer.\"Given instant, easy access to infor- mation available online, which allowsstudents to fact-check, Dr. Cohen-Osher suggests that medical studentscould better use their time to under-stand medicine rather than unques-tioningly absorb facts. Ideally, shewants to see critical, rather than rote,learning stressed. Careful not to den-igrate generations of instruction, sheinstead notes that technology couldbe used to help create better physi-cians as they look up what is neededwhile spending more time listening topatients. \"It is not about how much they know and can memorize,\" Dr. Cohen- Osher says, \"but how well can youaccess things? And what kind of com-municator are you? And how do youclinically reason? It is really about pushing education to that next leveland driving home critical thinking,teamwork, and the doctor-patientrelationship.\" Mulling over how people learn and the best methods to educate comesnaturally to the Randolph native.Her mother, grandmother, and uncleare teachers, and her sister is a lawprofessor. Like her siblings, Dr.Cohen-Osher chose to attend a stateuniversity. At Rutgers, she pursuedthe BA/MD program, studying biolo-gy and psychology as an undergrad. Postdoctoral training included an internship in family medicine at theUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison,then a residency at MacNeal FamilyMedicine in Berwyn, Illinois. Whenthe opportunity arose to participatein a master teacher fellowship in theTufts University Family MedicineResidency Program, Dr. Cohen-Osher accepted it, heeding a mentor'sadvice to seize exciting opportunitiesas they presented themselves. Takingthat advice to heart, she continuedher journey and earned a master'sdegree in medical education from theUniversity of Dundee in Scotland.

ChandlerHealth Center. \"And two was howcomplicated all of the medical needswere that this primary care doctorwas able to take care of, and beingstruck by the relationship he was ableto cultivate with his patients.\" Honoring the importance of relation- ships\u2014between physician and patientand between professor and student\u2014iscrucial to her. In both cases, thereneeds to be open communication, Dr.Cohen-Osher stressed. Though spend-ing the bulk of her time rethinkingmedical education and teaching edu-cational theory and instructional designin master's programs at Boston Univer-sity and the MGH Institute of HealthProfessions, a graduate university ofhealth sciences founded by Massachu-setts General Hospital, also in Boston,she still considers herself \"very mucha family doctor\" and one who revelsin the variety and joy her work brings. \"What I try to impart on fellow educators is that we need to rememberhow vulnerable you are when you arelearning, and how important the roleof being the more knowledgeable per-son to a learner can be,\" Dr. Cohen-Osher says. \"Rather than thinkingabout teachers at the top of the hierar-chy, we need to think about all of us,teachers and students, as learners whomake mistakes and have to grow, andwe need to create that space for oneanother.\" RobertWoodJohnson IMEDICINE 49 COURTESY OF MOLLY COHEN-OSHER, MD '05 Honoring the importance of relationships\u2014between physician and patient and between professor and student\u2014is crucial to Molly Cohen-Osher, MD '05.
