Kalkbrenner, PhD, MPH,1Rebecca J. Schmidt, MS, PhD,2,3and Annie C. Penlesky, MPH1 In the past decade, the number of epidemiological publications addressing environmental chemical exposures and autism hasgrown tremendously. These studies are important because it isnow understood that environmental factors play a larger role incausing autism than previously thought and because theyaddress modiable risk factors that may open up avenues forthe primary prevention of the disability associated with autism. In this review, we covered studies of autism and estimates of exposure to tobacco, air pollutants, volatile organic compoundsand solvents, metals (from air, occupation, diet, dental amal-gams, and thimerosal-containing vaccines), pesticides, andorganic endocrine-disrupting compounds such retard-ants, non-stick chemicals, phthalates, and bisphenol A. Weincluded studies that had individual-level data on autism,exposure measures pertaining to pregnancy or the 1st year oflife, valid comparison groups, control for confounders, andadequate sample sizes. Despite the inherent error in themeasurement of many of these environmental exposures, which is likely to attenuate observed associations, some environmentalexposures showed associations with autism, especially trafc-related air pollutants, some metals, and several pesticides, withsuggestive trends for some volatile organic compounds (e.g.,methylene chloride, trichloroethylene, and styrene) and phtha-lates. Whether any of these play a causal role requires further study. Given the limited scope of these publications, other environmental chemicals cannot be ruled out, but have not yetbeen adequately studied. Future research that addresses theseand additional environmental chemicals, including their mostcommon routes of exposures, with accurate exposure measure-ment pertaining to several developmental windows, is essentialto guide efforts for the prevention of the neurodevelopmentaldamage that manifests in autism symptoms. Curr Probl Pediatr Adolesc Health Care ]]]];]:1-42 Introduction and Scope of Review Autism Spectrum Disorder, commonly called autism, is now known to occur in about 1 in 68 children in the U.S.,1increasing the likelihood that clinicians will care for children, adolescents, andadults with autism. All people with autism havedifculties in social communication and restricted interests and behaviors. The severity of the symptoms and the level of functional impairment vary widely.A review in this journal has covered the important topics of screening/early warning signs, the role of the pediatrician within a multidisciplinary team, and theevidence base for treatments, 2with another reviewcovering pharmacological interventions, genetic test- ing, and treatment across the life course.3 Herein, we focus on processes occurring earlier in the life history of autism \u2014exploring xenobiotic risk factors that tip the balance to cause the emergence of autism symptoms in a child. We have focused on environmental chemicals; agents that arise outside of the human body;and enter via the routes of ingestion, inhalation, dermal absorption, injection, and placental transport from mother to fetus. Other risk factors ti n t ot h eb r o a d e r denition of environment and are likely important, such as nutrients, medications, obstetric complications, mater- nal medical conditions, and social/demographic in fluen- ces, but were not included in this review. The traditional environmen tal chemical exposures that we included are important in part because exposure to these factors can be reduced, opening up viable avenuesfor the primary prevention of autism. Increasingly, clini- cians are called upon to play a role in identifying, researching, educating about, and advocating for changeregarding these modi able chemical exposures.

Exercising behavioral or consumer choices, however, cannotentirely protect a patient from these widespread exposures, especially for chemicals that are ubiquitous, such asair pollution, or for contaminants thatare unknown to the patient. Environmental chemical expo- sures are increasingly understoodto be important in causing autism, with current theories positing that autism is caused by the interplay of multiple genetic and environmentalcontributions that differ from individual to individ- ual. 4,5While initial studies suggested a strong genetic heritability of autism, recent studies with larger samplesizes have demonstrated a lesser in fluence, including a study of over 14,000 children with autism in Sweden that demonstrated a heritability of 50%, supporting an equally strong role for environmental risk factors. 6 Genetic and environmental factors may combine to disrupt the normal processes of nervous system devel- opment, interfering with neuron formation and migra-tion, synapse formation, or neurological connectivity, ultimately causing autism. Environmental chemical exposures may act through pathophysiologies, includ-ing the direct disruption of cells and structures of the nervous system, endocrine hormone- or immune system-mediated impacts, epigenetic changes, andmore ( Table 1 ). The important role for environmental chemical exposures in these processes has received data support and increased attention. 7-9These calls for research are bolstered by the dearth of understanding ofthe role of our complex, human-created chemical environment on development, with estimates that, out of a chemical universe topping 80,000 agents, over1000 have laboratory evidence of neurotoxicity, but only a small fraction have been studied in humans during crit-ical windows of develop- ment. 10,11Human exposures to these chemicals are common:250 xenobiotic chemicals weredetected in biological samples from a 2013 representative sam- ple of the U.S. in the NationalHealth and Nutrition Examina- tion Survey. 12Furthermore, chemical mixtures pre- dominate; in earlier data from this same study, 100% ofpregnant women had detectable levels of ve chemical classes that were examined. 13 Although a mere decade ago publications addressing the environment and autism could almost not be found,now epidemiological publications have examined the association of autism with estimates of exposure to tobacco, air pollutants, vol atile organic compounds, metals, pesticides, and org anic pollutants, such as plasticizers and non-stick chemicals. The state of evi- dence regarding autism and exposures to some of thesepollutants has been reviewed. 14,15In this review, we provide contextual information about these chemicals, along with an assessment of the current state ofepidemiological knowledge regarding exposures to these chemicals and autism, with special attention to assessing validity, integrating results, and evaluating evidence forcausality. Our goal is to evaluate and summarize thecurrent state of knowledge, while informing clinicians about the complexities surrounding study in this area together with current approaches. We seek to engageclinicians in the continued identi cation of, and ulti- mately, the reduction of, environmental factors that harm neurodevelopment, speci cally autism ( Box 1 ). TABLE 1.

Our inclusion criteria are listed in Box 2 and described in greater detail following. Population-Based Human Studies This review focuses on evidence regarding environ- mental chemical exposures and autism from human,population-based literature, that is, epidemiologicalstudies, published as primary research reports in English-language, peer-reviewed journals with publi- cation dates prior to March 1, 2014. We also includedarticles under review when one of us was an author. Findings from controlled laboratory studies on other animals are important in elucidating mechanisms,screening many exposures, and creating highly con- trolled conditions that strengthen causal inference, but cannot directly address the full spectrum of autism orthe real-world human living condition. We separately included estimates for multiple chem- icals within a publication that met our inclusioncriteria, for example, reporting on inhaled dieselparticles, metals, and volatile organic compounds from one publication. 16We did not, however, include multiple measures for one chemical-autism ques- tion from a given publication, but instead includedonly the measure most illustrative of the ndings, as follows: when results were presented for both the continuous autism phenotype and a dichotomousautism classi cation, we chose the association that had the most precision, or was of the same type of comparison as the other studies of the same chemical. When exposures were categorized into different levelsor geographic distances, we chose either the results emphasized by the authors, or the comparisons that were the most extreme, such as presenting the 4thquartile comparison of an air pollutant rather than the 2nd quartile comparison, or the closest geographic distance to a pesticide application rather than amoderate distance. Individual-Level Data on Autism Diagnoses or Behaviors We restricted our scope of review to studies that were able to include individual-level data on autism or thedimensional nature of autism-like symptoms in analy- ses, excluding those studies that only had access to aggregated data on autism occurrence (e.g., community-level or ecological outcome data). Although ecologicalstudies are useful in generating hypotheses, weBox 1 -Abbreviations CDC: United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention EPA: United States Environmental Protection Agency FDA: United States Food and Drug AdministrationDSM: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association, various versions ICD: International Classi cation of Diseases, morbidity and disease codes, various versions ASD: autism spectrum disorderAD: autistic disorderAsp: Asperger 's disorder ASD w/ ID: ASD with co-occurring intellectual disability ASD w/o ID: ASD without co-occurring intellectual disability ASD w/ Reg.: ASD with developmental regressionASD-NOS: ASD not otherwise speci ed PDD: pervasive developmental disorder dence interval NATA: National-scale Air Toxics Assessment model of the US EPA CALINE4: California line source air emissions dispersion model Box 2 -Review inclusion criteria Primary report of population-based human (epidemiologi- cal) research.

Curr Probl PediatrAdolesc Health Care, Month 3excluded such studies because of some inherent limi- tations in this design. In aggregate outcome data, it cannot be known that the individual experiencing the exposure is the same individual within the group thathad an autism diagnosis. Furthermore, it is not possible to account for individual-level confounding in fluences in this type of design, biases that are critically importantto remove before concluding that an observed statisticalassociation represents a causal relationship. 17,18In contrast, we did include studies that measured exposure at the community level (ecological exposures ). Community-level exposures (e.g., an air toxic pollutant estimated for a census tract) often serve as reasonable proxies of individual-level exposure, although theyinclude some degree of expo- sure measurement error. Importantly, when these stud-ies include an individualmeasure of autism, proper confounding control is possi- ble and they are not subject tothe ecological fallacy. The studies included in this review included data frommulti-faceted research studies and from pre-existing records (Table 2 ). Different means of diagnosing autism or measuring autism symptoms and characteristics (the continuous autism phenotype) were included ( Table 3 ). Measures of the continuous autism phenotype in a general population differ from clinicaldiagnoses because fewer study children will exhibit symptoms at the upper extreme that would lead to an autism diagnosis, and because the behavioral traitsmeasured may differ from the constructs that led a clinician to diagnose autism. We have included thesestudies because the psychometric autism screening tests used have been validated, the continuous meas- ures allow for robust statistical properties, all children are tested and so an outside comparison group is notneeded, and these studies allow greater feasibility for prospective, and therefore more accurate, measurement of prenatal environmental exposures. Prenatal and Early Postnatal Exposures We restricted this review to studies that addressed chemical exposures during, or pertaining to, concep- tion, pregnancy, and the 1st postnatal year, to assure that the exposure could have been part of the multi- factorial landscape that pre- ceded and caused the emergence of autism symp-toms. Although the precise crit- ical periods of susceptibility to environmental factors forautism have not been fully elucidated, evidence from neu- roanatomical, animal, and epi-demiologic studies support and early postnatal origins of autism. 19-24A crit- ical period in early pregnancy was suggested from a study of autism cases suspected to be caused by thalidomide exposure in early preg- nancy.22Later pregnancy and early postnatal life are additionally implicated by accumulating molecular and pathological evidence pointing to altered neuronal connectivity and a resultant perturbation in signalingpathways, systems under intense development in theseperiods. 25,26These developmental windows are a time of known neurodevelopmental susceptibility, and it is TABLE 2.

For example, metals in hair during childhood may indicate altered metal metabolism and clearance, or altered diet or medication use, any ofwhich could result from autism, instead of contributing to the development of autism. As illustration, we provided a partial list of publications excluded becauseof exposure timing criteria ( Table 4 ), but this is not a comprehensive list, especially in the case of metal exposures, for which there is a large literature measur- ing metal exposure in childhood. Valid Comparisons We included studies without major validity concerns of selection biases and confounding, because when theseinfluences can be ruled out, epidemiological studies reporting associations can suggest a population-level causal association between the risk factor and autism.Across all studies, we evaluated whether the comparison group, typically children without autism, was a valid representation of the underlying population that gener-ated the group of children with autism diagnoses. Selection bias is common in studies of autism because children receiving an autism diagnoses may differ fromthe set of all children who could, under ideal conditions,receive a diagnosis. For example, disadvantaged racial/ ethnic or sociodemographic groups have been shown to have lower rates of diagnosis 1,29and up to 20% of children are not diagnosed by 8 years of age,1perhaps because of limited health care access or parent knowl- edge of developmental milestones. We excluded a studywhen we assessed that the comparison population may be meaningfully different from the underlying popula- tion that generated the group of children with autism,when key confounding factors (which differed by chemical group) were not accounted for, or when publications did not provide the details to assess theseconsiderations. We reported on the speci c reasons for every publication excluded due to major validity prob- lems that otherwise met inclusion criteria ( Table 4 ). Adequate Sample Sizes and Statistical Precision An alternate explanation of an elevated (or reduced) measure of association between an environmentalchemical and autism is sampling error, often ruled out using standard statistical testing and pvalues. In this review, we emphasized the magnitude of the associationtogether with the precision with which it was estimated, where the precision is re flected by the width of the condence interval. We, and others, prefer this approach over dichotomizing results into those that do or do not pass a statistical signi cance threshold, because more information on the strength of the evidence is consid-ered. 30,31Study estimates that have greater precisionTABLE 3.

We have excluded some estimates with poor preci- sion, which we de ned as estimates with a con dence interval ratio or difference (upper 95% CI divided by,for ORs, or with a subtraction of, for slopes, the lower 95% CI) 410. These estimates arose when fewer than ve children with autism had the xenobiotic exposure, a commonly used criterion of insuf cient sample size. Every publication excluded using precision criteria is listed in Table 4 . Identifying and Reviewing Publications We used a multi-method, iterative approach to locate all publications that met these inclusion criteria, as follows. We searched our personal libraries andperformed online searches in PubMed and Google Scholar, including the PubMed feature \"Related Cita- tions.\"These searches used the outcome keywords: autism, Pervasive Developmental Disorder, and socialimpairment, combined with keywords pertaining to the exposure (e.g., for air pollutants: air pollution, airtoxic, and traf c). We then searched for additional publications by the authors and parent studies that were generated from the initial search (e.g., CHARGE). We reviewed all citations from each located primarypublication, from two recent reviews of environmental factors and autism, 14,32and from reviews of individual exposure groups, such as thimerosal-containing vac-cines and autism, 33,34and endocrine-disrupting com- pounds and autism.35When publications were located outside of the online literature searches, we thenperformed repeat online literature searches after adjust- ing our keywords and approach. We recognized that associations of tobacco and autism were often reportedin descriptive tables of publications without beingmentioned in the title or abstract, and so we widened our scope of consideration for tobacco publications. For each exposure group (e.g., pesticides) at least twoof us performed independent, iterative searches. Among primary, human population-based publica- tions pertaining to our included chemical groups, weTABLE 4.

This resulted in a set of 58 publications that met inclusioncriteria 1 -5 (see Box 2 ). We thoroughly reviewed these 58 publications, excluding 26 due to validity and precision criteria 6 -7(Table 4 ), resulting in the nal set of 32 publications included, several of whichreported on multiple environmental chemicals. Evidence Regarding Environmental Chemical Pollutants Tobacco Tobacco use, despite its known harmful health impacts, is still common: more than 13% of women smokedcigarettes during pregnancy in the U.S. in 1999 -2006 and even more infants live with a parent who smokes. 36Both direct smoke and secondhand smoke are complexmixtures including thousands of chemicals, 37including nicotine, volatile organic compounds, and metals such as cadmium and lead,38,39and so tobacco smoke overlaps with chemical groups covered later in this review. Increasingly, it is understood that there are important differences in the chemical make-up of smoke inhaled bya smoker (direct) vs. smoke inhaled by a non-smoker(secondhand smoke), with each representing a different toxic load with suspected different impacts on neuro- development. These exposures are strongly suspected todisrupt the developing nervous system, with evidence supporting links with attention-de cit disorders and intellectual disabilities. 40-42Mechanisms responsible for the harmful effects of tobacco include direct interaction of nicotine with the receptor of the neurotransmitter acetyl- choline, impacts on the immune system, interference withfolate homeostasis, general oxidative stress, epigeneticalterations, and placental blood flow impacts. 43-49 Tobacco exposure is currently one of the more-studied chemical exposures in relation to autism, in part becauseit is reported on birth certi cates and in medical registries, and so is often studied in concert with other obstetric factors (e.g., C-section and pr eterm birth). Because of the strong associations between tobacco use and lower income or education, which are related to many other health-detracting factors such as stress and poor nutrition,socioeconomic status is an especially important potential confounder of this question, and so we excluded studies that did not account for this ( Table 4 ). We included seven studies ( Table 5 ), taking place in the U.S., Canada,Sweden, Finland, Norway, and England/Wales. These studies included cohort and nested case -control samples and varying measures of autism, ranging from parent report of diagnosis to direct evaluation of children.Tobacco use in pregnancy was measured by parent recall, which is subject to some degree of under-reporting because of stigma, and by medical data (e.g., birthcerticates) that was collected pr ospectively and consid- ered reasonably valid for measuring in utero tobacco exposure, 50but was still subject to under-reporting.36 Results of these studies were scattered above and below the null, with most con dence intervals crossing the null, consistent with no association between direct maternal smoking in pregnancy and Autism SpectrumDisorder diagnosis, overall ( Fig. 1 ). Some studies also examined autism subtypes, including lower-func- tioning groups (e.g., autistic disorder and AutismSpectrum Disorder with co-occurring intellectual dis-ability) and higher-functioning groups (e.g., Asperger 's Disorder and Autism Spectrum Disorder without co- occurring intellectual disabilities). Associationsbetween maternal smoking during pregnancy and higher-functioning autism were elevated compared to associations with lower-functioning autism for twostudies, including a study for which one of us (A.K.) was an author ( Fig. 1 , green and purple). 51,52Two studies examining the continuous autism phenotypealso suggested that tobacco may impact higher- functioning autism ( Fig. 1 ). 53,54These associations between tobacco and higher-functioning autism andcontinuously measured autism behaviors could (1)indicate that direct maternal smoking causes elevation of some domains of autism, such as social functioning; (2) re flect random error; (3) be caused by confounding bias that acts differently for different autism subtypes; or (4) actually re flect associations with other neuro- developmental disorders, for example, attention-de cit problems, which are suspected to be in fluenced by tobacco, and are highly comorbid with autism. 55,56 The importance of social class confounding for studies of tobacco and autism was af rmed in the results: associations were altered after adjustment for factors such as maternal education or income. The direction of this confounding differed by country. In the U.S. andCanada, associations were higher after adjusting for sociodemographic variables, 52,57whereas in European countries (Sweden, Finland, and Norway), associationswere attenuated after adjustment. 51,53,58,59These patterns may re flect different practices of autism screening and health services access between the U.S. vs. Curr Probl PediatrAdolesc Health Care, Month ]]]] 7TABLE 5.

A possible link with higher- functioning autism was suggested, but complicated by sociodemographic confounding and the phenotypicoverlap with other neurodevelopmental disabilities. The published literature on the role of tobacco is currently limited by the absence of any measures ofsecondhand smoke exposure to the mother during pregnancy. This is an important gap, given that (1) secondhandsmoke is a different chemical mixture than primary smoke, (2) there is evidence that sec-ondhand smoke exhibits neuro-developmental toxicity, 61,62and(3) it is a very common exposure. Given the complex- ity of tobacco mixtures and the biologic plausibility of impact, future studies should evaluate the role ofsecondhand exposure and consider biomarker meas-ures of tobacco; these measures are objective, quanti- tative, and integrate all sources of exposure and, although not yet used in this literature due to thepreponderance of retrospective designs, could be used when biologic materials have been stored or can be prospectively collected. Research on the neurotoxicityof tobacco should additionally resolve different com- ponents of the combustion mixture, which may openup more customized direc- tion for preventive actions. Lastly, future studies shouldconsider the possibility ofconfounding by genetics. 59 Fig 1. Associations between autism and maternal smoking in pregnancy.

In summary, evidence does not support a strong causal link between direct maternal smoking during pregnancy and autism. Curr Probl PediatrAdolesc Health Care, Month ]]]] 9Women who continue to smoke when pregnant may be genetically predisposed toward addictive behavior, which in turn may pass along increased genetic loading for neuropathologies that are related to autism risk (e.g., through dopamine or serotonin pathways), compli- cating the study of tobacco and neurodevelopment. Regulated and Trafc-Related Air Pollutants Outside air pollutants include hundreds of chem- icals, present as particulates, droplets, or gases. These pollutants arise mostly from human activities, conven- tionally grouped into (1) point pollutants arising fromspatially separated large plumes (factories, powerplants, and waste incineration); (2) area pollutants associated with population density (gas stations, dry cleaners, and residential and commercial heating andcooling); and (3) mobile pollutants associated with vehicles, primarily from roadway traf c. After enter- ing the atmosphere, pollutants move and undergochemical reactions, creating new pollutants. In this section, we discuss air pollutants that arise from traf c or that are regulated in the U.S., such as particulatematter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), and ozone. In the next section, we cover volatileorganic compounds (VOCs) inthe outside air together with indoor sources of VOCs. Lastly, we cover airborne met-als such as mercury, lead, and manganese in the section on metals. Although levels ofsome air pollutants have declined in the U.S. because of the Clean Air Act andvehicle emissions standards, these declines have notput an end to concerns about the health impacts of air pollutants, in part because the developmental impacts of current levels of ambient air pollutants have notbeen adequately studied. Furthermore, recent reduc- tions may be offset by future population growth, climate change 63and international transport of air pollutants.64 Air pollutants enter the human body via inhalation and by direct translocation from the nose to the brainvia the olfactory bulb. 65Particulate pollutants have mixed chemical properties and are de ned by size, such as particulate matter o2.5m( P M 2.5)a n d particulate matter o10m in diameter (PM 10).Smaller particulate pollutants penetrate more deeply into the lungs than larger particulates and have greater surface area, increasing their biological activity. Chemical constituents of air pollution can enter bloodcirculation; the level of absorption and half-life in the body vary from chemical to chemical. Some air pollutants are known to induce oxidative stress andcause a systemic in flammatory reaction, a proposed mechanism whereby air pollutant exposures may perturb neurodevelopment. 66-68Fetuses can be expos- ed to the chemical constituents of the air pollutantitself (e.g., metals) and also to the elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines (or other resultant biologic factors) in the maternal circulation. Given the chem-ical and physical complexity of air pollutants, some likely cause additional pathophysiologies that have not yet been fully explored, such as epigeneticalterations. 69 Air pollution exposures are widespread. While urban areas are hotspots for air pollutant mixtures \u2014given that air pollutants arise from traf c and population density \u2014rural areas can also have high levels of air pollutants when they are close to factories, waste incineration facilities, and thelike. The spatial patterns of air pollutant exposures coincide with other drivers of autismoccurrence and detection, neces- sitating the strong control of socioeconomic confounding forquestions about air pollutantsand autism. As an example, indi- viduals with high pollutant expo- sures may be living nearhighways in neighborhoods that are impoverished, full of social stressors, and reduced access to healthy food orhealth care. Seven publications of traf c-related and criteria air pollutants met our inclusion criteria for further consid-eration ( Table 6 ). These studies all took place in the U.S. and included case -control studies with controls sampled from a population base and one prospective cohort study. 70The studies had adequate sample sizes (ranging from 284 to 7594 children with autism) and controlled for appropriate confounders such as mater- nal age and parents 'education level. Although con- founding by such family social characteristics was expected, the degree of this confounding was not strong and acted in opposite directions across studies,The spatial patterns of air pollutant exposures coincide with other drivers of autism occurrence and detection, necessitating the strong control of socioeconomic confounding for questions about air pollutants and autism. 10 Curr Probl PediatrAdolesc Health Care, Month ]]]]TABLE 6.

Season of birth was accounted for in one of the included studies. 74 One potential confounding in fluence was not explor- ed in any study: that of noise due to traf c. Noise can cause a stress response or interfere with sleep and hasbeen associated with cognitive performance. 75It is possible that associations observed between autism and air pollutants from traf c could be due wholly or in part to traf c noise, although one attempt to adjust for noise in studies of traf c pollution has not borne this out.76 Results for the included studies showed elevated associations between autism and measures of mixed air pollutant exposures and diesel particulate matter (Fig. 2 ) and for the individual air pollutants PM 2.5, PM 10,a n dN O 2, with less consistently elevated associ- ations for NO, ozone, and CO ( Fig. 3 ). The size of the ORs was not consistent across studies, despite thestandardized comparison of air pollutant concentrations that we calculated, for example, ORs were around1.5 per 10 ppb increase in NO 2for the California CHARGE study ( Fig. 3 ,r e d ) ,72but only 1.04 for the California Department of Developmental Services study (Fig. 3 ,g r e e n ) .73Reasons for this different size in impact could re flect air pollutant differences between California regions, a greater degree of exposure meas- urement error in the DDS study, or that this studyadjusted for a possible mediating factor, gestational age,which did result in the attenuation of ORs for some air pollutants. 73For almost every pollutant and every study, associations were stronger for exposures in the 3rdtrimester of pregnancy and the 1st year of life compared to in earlier pregnancy ( Fig. 3 ). All of these studies estimated exposure to outside levels of these air pollutants using historical data that could be related geographically to the home residence of the pregnant woman or infant. Direct person-based airsampling was not possible in these retrospective studies.The residence-based metrics included measurement error due to inaccuracies in geo-locating residences, air modeling assumptions, and the inability to include timespent away from home, measurement error that would be expected to attenuate ndings. Yet elevated associations were found for some air pollutants. As pointed out by theauthors of these studies, the likelihood is low that exposure measurement error could have resulted in overestimated associations (possible if measurement error was related to autism status). It is therefore possible that these study results are conservative, that is, these air Fig 2. Associations between autism and estimates of exposure to mixed trafc and diesel air pollutants.

In summary, the published literature shows associations between traf c-related and criteria air pollutants and the development of autism and possibly increased suscepti- bility when exposures occur in late pregnancy or early postnatal life. These ndings are bolstered by strong study designs and consistent ndings across different means of measuring pollutant concentration and identifying chil- dren with autism. Reasons for these ndings include a true causal relationship, a consistent bias such as residualsocial class confounding, or the impacts of traf cn o i s e . Questions about the size of the impact and the individual chemical pollutant most responsible for these ndings remain, as most studies have not accounted for the correlations between multiple chemical pollutants or the differences in air pollutant mixtures between the West andEast coasts of the U.S. Volatile Organic Compounds/Solvents Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) include a large group of chemicals that become gaseous close to roomtemperature and are released/emitted from products or processes (sometimes called \"off-gassing \"or\"out-gas- sing\"), chemicals such as formaldehyde and benzene. VOCs overlap partly with other chemical groups: organicsolvents (a group de ned by their ability to dissolve other chemicals) and some air toxics (de ned as chemicals detectable in outside air that are known to harm humanhealth). VOCs are emitted from many human products and activities, including indoor residential and workplace paints, furnishings, and air fresheners; vehicle fuel com-bustion (benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylene, abbreviated BTEX); dry ing (tetrachloroethylene, also known as or PERC); refrigeration;cigarette smoke (benzene, ethyl benzene, formaldehyde,and xylenes); hair and nail salons (toluene); and in other industries involving fuels, lubricants, paints, and more. Organic solvents have been reported as among the mostprevalent occupational chemical exposures for women. 77VOC concentrations are generally 2 -5 times higher in indoor compared to outdoor air,78,79and have been hypothesized to cause Sick Build-ing syndrome. 80VOCs are ubiq- uitous and occur in combination with other VOCs and pollutantscovered elsewhere in this review:tobacco, benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylenes have been widely detected in biological samples from a U.S. representative sample in2013. 12These body burdens are especially notable given that the biological half-lives of VOCs range from minutes to days, indicating frequent exposure to these chemicals. The primary route of exposure to VOCs is by inhalation, although VOCs can be ingested through contaminated drinking water and can be dermally absorbed.81Biologic mechanisms of harm include oxidative stress after metabolism by P450 enzymes and direct interference with cell membrane integrity for the many VOCs that are lipophilic.82VOCs interact with many organ systems, including the nervous system, as demonstrated by evidence in rats of neuro- developmental toxicity.83Epidemiological studies of the impacts of early-life VOC exposures are few, buthave demonstrated that women occupationally exposed to multiple VOCs have children with cognitive and visual -motor functioning de cits 84,85and symptoms of attention-de cit disorder.86 The seven studies of VOCs included in our review (Table 7 ) measured exposures with the following meth- ods: (1) self-report or birth certi cate report of parental exposure in the workplace and occupation, which was coded into multiple chemical classes based on the workduties and products manufactured 87,88; (2) parent report of exposure to \"textiles \"and\"newly built homes \"89;a n d (3) a vehicle and factory emissions-based air pollutantmodel of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency thatmodels census tract levels of air toxics for selected years, the National-scale Air Toxics Assessment (NATA), including a study for which one of us (A.K.) was anauthor. 16,70,90The NATA model predicted concentra- tions of over 30 air toxics in 1996 and over 180 air toxics in 1999, 2002, and 2005. In summary, these exposuremethods had the following strengths: (1) corresponding to the pertinent prenatal and early postnatal time periods; (2) independent expert veri cation/coding of occupa- tional exposures 87,88;a n d( 3 )p r o - spective measurement, along with a reduced chance of a recall bias, in the studies of air toxics and theoccupation study based on birth certicate-reported occupation. 16,70,88,90 Results for VOC exposures and autism were scattered above and below the null, a pattern expectedVOC concentrations are generally 2 -5 times higher in indoor compared to outdoor air, and have been hypothesized to cause Sick Building syndrome. 14 Curr Probl PediatrAdolesc Health Care, Month ]]]]TABLE 7.

Upon closer inspection, a few groups of VOCs (paints and chlorinated solvents) showed elevated associations compared to other groups.Some individual VOCs had consistently elevated asso- ciations, although the VOC concentration comparisons differed somewhat across studies: methylene chloride,trichloroethylene, and styrene. Given this consistency,and that some of these associations had the statistical power to rule out no association, these VOCs deserve future study as candidate risk factors for autism. Published results for this research question often had wide con dence intervals re flecting small numbers of exposed children with autism, especially for the occupa-tional studies. This imprecision and uncertainty in estimates also resulted from the inherent measurement error of VOCs in these studies. Despite the strengths ofthe exposure methods, all of these methods providedonly a rough approximation of the internal dose of VOCs to the developing nervous system. The emissions- based NATA model is especially problematic for VOCsbecause it relies on proximity to sources emitting VOCs outdoors, such as traf c and large factories, ignoring the important unique indoor sources for several VOCs. 79 In summary, studies of VOCs and autism, despite being underpowered with some degree of exposure measurement error, have shown patterns suggestive ofcausal associations that point to the need for more research on certain VOCs (e.g., methylene chloride, trichloroethylene, and styrene). Other VOCs are notcleared from culpability, but instead have simply notbeen adequately studied. Given that VOCs themselves occur in mixtures and also occur together with other pollutants, large studies with multiple detailed measuredexposures would be required to disentangle a potential causal impact of an individual VOC, ubiquitous chem- icals with high biologic plausibility of damaging thedeveloping nervous system. Metals From Air, Occupation, DentalAmalgams, and Diet Lead and mercury have strong and consistent evi- dence of harming the devel- oping nervous system,resulting in impairments such as the loss of IQ points and behavioral problems. 42Othermetals, including arsenic, fluoride, and manganese, are increasingly recognized as also being human neuro- developmental toxicants.11,91-93These health impacts are not restricted to high-exposure scenarios, but havebeen seen with typical exposure levels, leading to \"silent toxicity. \" 94Metals cross the placenta and the blood -brain barrier, accumulate in developing brains, and interact directly at the cellular level through avariety of mechanisms, including interfering with key cellular receptors and causing reactive oxygen species. Metals are widespread in the environment, each metal with different sources of exposure, via ingestion and inhalation, illustrated here using the examples of lead, arsenic, and mercury. Historically, leaded gaso-line and lead-containing paint resulted in the contam- ination of homes and soils, and many families in the U.S. remain exposed to lead hazards, especially thoseliving in poorly maintained older homes. Sociodemo-graphic and neighborhood factors, therefore, are important potential confounders when studying lead (and other metal) exposures. Lead can still be meas-ured in outside air, and air may constitute an impor- tant source of lead exposure for some families. 95 Arsenic is found in contaminated drinking water resulting from arsenical soil, including in some parts of the U.S., with secondary sources including arsenic- treated wood, arsenic-containing pesticides, and somedietary sources (e.g., rice). Mercury exposure, espe- cially the most toxic form, methylmercury, occurs primarily from diet, because it bioaccumulates in theenvironment. Persistent environmental chemicalslike mercury often have af nity for fatty tissues (they are lipophilic) and so are not readily broken down. After widespread use and distribution, such chemicalsdeposit in waterways and concentrate toward the top of the food chain in predatory sh and human milk. The same sh that contain methylmercury accumulate other persistent organic pollutants, such as those covered later in this review, and also contain bene - cial nutrients (e.g., fatty acids),leading to problems of nega-tive and positive confounding from the mixtures of chemicals present in some sh. Less important sources of mercury exposure include dental amal- gams (during placement andfrom continual release of trace amounts of mercury vapor for the life of the amalgam) andLead and mercury have strong and consistent evidence of harming the developing nervous system, resulting in impairments such as the loss of IQ points and behavioral problems. 16 Curr Probl PediatrAdolesc Health Care, Month ]]]]Fig 4.

Five epidemiological studies of metal exposure from air, occupation, dental amalgams, and diet wereincluded ( Table 8 ). The studies addressed multiple airborne metals among a panel of other air pollutant exposures measured using the emissions-based airtoxics model, NATA, 16,70,90metals from parental occupation in the California-based CHARGE Study,87 mercury from dental amalgams present in mothersduring pregnancy, and mercury in maternal hairstudied in the Republic of Seychelles, a high sh- consuming island country in the Indian Ocean near Madagascar. 96 Across all metals in these studies, results were predominantly above the null, a pattern consistent with either higher risk due to metal exposure or consistentresidual confounding across designs, confounding nothighly likely given that all of these studies adjusted for socioeconomic status and maternal age, but possible (Fig. 5 ). The pattern of elevated associations was especially striking given the measurement error inher- ent in the emissions-based air pollutant model used in three of these studies, which would be expected toattenuate observed ORs. 16,70,90 For the metals chromium and nickel, the ORs were of consistent magnitude across studies, although the expo-sure concentration comparisons differed somewhat; if combined in a meta-analysis, the expectation would be that precision would improve, resolving elevated asso-ciations ( Fig. 5 ). In one study, lead, and, to a lesser extent, manganese, appeared inversely related to autism risk, which could have been caused by a stronger association with the comparison group in this design:children with speech and language impairment ( Fig. 5 , purple). 16Autism risk due to mercury exposure was supported by the studies of airborne mercury,70,90but not from the Seychelles longitudinal biomarker study reflecting all sources of mercury ( Fig. 5 ,r e d ) .96One possible reason for the lack of observed elevatedassociation in the Seychellesstudy is that mercury exposure was almost entirely from sh consumption in this popula-tion, so that the impacts of brain-enhancing nutrients con- tained in sh may have coun- teracted any toxic impact of mercury. Mercury from dental amalgams was also associatedwith increased autism severity ( Fig. 5 , dark green). 97In this study, some typical confounders were not accounted for, but were unlikely to strongly bias results: maternal age, while a strong risk factor for autismdiagnosis, may not be relevant for autism severity, 98and sociodemographics were somewhat homogenous in this study population in which all study children hadreceived an autism diagnosis and were attending agenetic clinic. In summary, the existing studies of autism due to metals from air, occupation, dental amalgams, and dietare suggestive that metal exposure may cause autism but are, for the most part, limited in scope. The only biomarker study took place in a high sh-consuming population with limited generalizability to other pop- ulations. The other studies only pertained to less important routes of metal exposure (e.g., air), and soare unlikely to represent the full impact of these metalson autism risk. For example, although three studies measured arsenic in ambient air, no studies addressed the most common source of arsenic: drinking water,and no studies addressed lead exposure from ingestion of items contaminated with house dust and soil. Given the established neurotoxicity of many metals and thesuggested trends shown here, future research to address the common sources of metal exposure and autism is essential. Metal (Ethylmercury) From Vaccinations Metal exposure, speci cally ethylmercury from the vaccine preservative thimerosal, has been studied in relation to autism and we reviewed these publications.Thimerosal contains ethylmercury, considered a less toxic form of mercury compared to methylmercury. 99 Because of the biologic plausibility that thimerosal may pose neurotoxic harm, the U.S. Food and Drug Admin-istration suggested removing, or reducing, thimerosal in childhood vaccines in 2001. Currently, the only vac- cines containing more than trace amounts of thimerosal are some in fluenza vaccines, to which both infants and pregnant women may be exposed. 100Of note, additional community and research attention regarding vac- cines and autism has focused onmeasles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which never contained thimerosal and so isoutside the scope of this review.Currently, the only vaccines containing more than trace amounts of thimerosal are some influenza vaccines, to which both infants and pregnant women may be exposed. 18 Curr Probl PediatrAdolesc Health Care, Month ]]]]TABLE 8.

The included studies utilized pre-existing data from government health registries or linked medical records from health maintenance organizations participating in the Vaccine Safety Datalink or the U.S.National Health Interview Survey and were all cohortdesigns or case -control designs nested within these cohorts ( Table 3 ). We included studies that adjusted for suspected confounders. Additionally, for this exposure(but not some others in this review), we also included studies that did not account for the potential confound- ing in fluences of maternal age or sociodemographics. This decision was based on our assessment that these factors did not act as strong confounders in the four studies that were able to adjust for these factors: ORswere identical after adjusting for maternal age (OR of1.12 and 1.12), 101similar when adjusting for education [OR of 3.0 vs. 2.8 (unadjusted)],102and similar in two studies that adjusted for both maternal age and educa-tion, among other factors [OR of 1.0 vs. 1.1 (unad- justed)] 103and [OR of 1.12 vs. 1.13 (unadjusted)].104 For all but two of the associations between thimerosal and autism, results were most consistent with a pattern due to chance, demonstrated by ORs of small magnitude (most between 0.9 and 1.2), above and below the null,and with con dence intervals spanning the null, suggest- ing that thimerosal does not increase autism risk ( Fig. 6 ). This assessment is consistent with previous reviews,including the Institute of Medicine review from 2004,which concluded that \"the body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism, \" 105 several other reviews,33,34,106-109and a meta-analysis published in 2014.110One exception to the pattern of no association was an estimate of thimerosal from multiplevaccines and Autism Spectrum Disorder with regression; this result was markedly protective/inverse but imprecise and inconsistent with biologic plausibility ( Fig. 6 , orange). 104The second exception was from a study of thimerosal from hepatitis B vaccination in the 1st month of life, limited to males, that showed an elevated association ( Fig. 6 , purple).102This result has not been included in prior reviews. Alternate explanations of this elevated result include (1) the failure to adjust for temporal trends, (2) random error and a consequent biasaway from the null given that only 30 cases were included, or (3) that non-mercury constituents of the hepatitis B vaccine could increase autism risk.Concluding that a factor like thimerosal is not causative using epidemiological studies is dif cult, however, and requires ruling out biases that may articially attenuate ORs. Although the studies we included met our validity criteria, some minor flaws may have created such an in fluence. For example, in a California study, 103it was assumed that all children obtaining Rh immunoglobulin received thimerosalexposure even though only about 50% of market formulations contained thimerosal. 15This situation could lead to attenuated observed ORs comparingbetween children who did and did not receive any RhIg vs. the ORs that would have been observed if thimerosal content was measured directly and wasrelated to autism status. Another example of compli- cations in this literature is that the healthiest babies may be given vaccines earlier, and may be independ-ently less likely to develop autism, possibly leading toan arti cial in fluence where earlier vaccines are associated with less autism. 15 When patterns of autism risk were examined by the timing of the vaccine, more associations for prenatal vaccines were above null compared to the later postnatal vaccines, such as in the case -control study conducted using the Vaccine Safety Datalink ( Fig. 6 , orange).104Whether these data support that the earlier, prenatal, vaccines deserve more research for causingautism is tenuous, but warrants mention because the only vaccines currently containing more than trace levels of thimerosal (in fluenza vaccines given to pregnant women) can be given prenatally. In summary, the published literature on thimerosal, although not consistently adjusted for some potential confounders and with other potential biases, does notsuggest an association with autism. The public health importance of this controversial issue has diminished given the prophylactic removal of thimerosal frompediatric vaccines, although pregnant women may still receive thimerosal-containing in fluenza vaccines. Of note, these studies have not examined the potentialinfluence of vaccine co-factors. Vaccines contain carriers and adjuvants (e.g., aluminum), each of which could possibly cause toxicity, and the active ingredient is an immune trigger that, itself, may be deleterious forthe developing nervous system.

Pesticide exposure is widespread, for example, ina representative sample in the U.S., OC pesticides were detected in over 97% of bio- samples, while OP pesticidemetabolites were detected in 70%. 12Pesticides can pass through the placenta and theblood -brain barrier. 113 Many pesticides act to control insects through direct impacts on the insect nervoussystem, with suspected analogous impacts on humans.Demonstrated biological mechanisms also suggest pesticides as candidate risk factors for autism. 112OP pesticides inhibit acetylycholinesterase production inthe brain, 114restricting neurotransmission in the peripheral and central nervous systems, ultimately impacting synapse formation, axon transmission, cellmaturation, and programmed cell death. 115In contrast, OC pesticides act on the nervous system via gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-mediated chlorideion channels through their endocrine-disrupting properties.117 Population-based human studies have shown some pesticides to cause neurodevelopmental decre-ments. 118-121 OP and OC pesticides are currently used most often in agricultural applications,122and so the primary route of exposure to OP and OC pesticides is via diet.123,124 Many different pesticides have been detected in fruits, vegetables, grains, and breast milk.125,126Secondary routes, especially for areas close to farms, include inhalation from pesticide drift after agricultural appli- cations127and dermal absorption from direct contact with a pesticide, most common in occupational set-tings. OC pesticides are persistent pollutants and some are detectable in the environment and human tissues decades after they have been banned, such as the OCpesticide DDT. 128 Pesticide exposures occur together with factors that may harm or bene t the developing nervous system, factors that can act as confounders in studies of pesticides and autism. Examples of pollutants that co-occur with pesticides in diet include metals fromsoil and chemicals in non-stick cookware (per co-exposures include aerosols from high- pressure cleaning,130and from fertilizer and animal waste.131Benecial co-exposures include vita- mins and minerals from the fruits, vegetables, and grains that contain pesticide residues. Sociodemo-graphics are also important to consider because dietarypatterns, including the consumption of an organic diet, determine pesticide exposure and also the ability to obtain an autismdiagnosis. Maternal age is another potential confounder because total body burden of pesticides increa-ses with age 132and advanced maternal age is a well-supported risk factor for autism.133,134 Seven epidemiological studies of pesticides and autism met our criteria for inclusion in this review (Table 10 ). All of these studies exhibited reliable information on autism diagnosis or characteristics,used suitable controls with limited selection bias, and accounted for important confounders such as social class and maternal age. OP and OC pesticides and theirmetabolites, as well as some other pesticides, were measured using maternal and child biological sam- ples, 135-137residential proximity to agricultural appli- cations,138,139and retrospective parent question- naires.87,140These studies generally supported an association with elevated risk of autism with pesticideexposure, with most point estimates above the null,many with large enough impacts and statistical pre- cision to rule out sampling error ( Fig. 7 ). Elevated associations were not limited to one pesticide class, butwere found for OC, OP, and other types of pesticides, and were not limited to one exposure route, but seen across studies addressing agricultural drift, use of flea/ tick pet treatments, and dietary sources as re flected by biomarkers ( Fig. 7 ). The largest measured impacts were seen in a study of agricultural drift for twodevelopmental windows: a period in the 1st trimesterof pregnancy corresponding to central nervous system development (pregnancy weeks: 1 -7), and a period that emerged, a posteriori , from the data (pregnancy weeks: 4 -12) ( Fig. 7 , orange). 138 Limitations in these studies include that none adjusted for other agricultural exposures, and it istherefore possible that observed associations between pesticides and autism may, in actuality, be re flecting a causal in fluence of another chemical along for the ride.Pesticides can pass through the placenta and the blood -brain barrier.

In one study among a largely Hispanic, agricultural community, the association between pesticides and autism may have been over-estimated because of unusual performance of thepsychometric test in this population and because the study used an OR, which is best suited for rare diseases, for a common outcome. 15 The elevated associations observed across this liter- ature may also be attenuated compared to the true relationship, given that pesticide exposure measure-ment methods included error. For example, residential proximity to agricultural applications may incur error from wind patterns, time spent away from home, orlimitations in the pesticide application data sour-ces. 138,139Another example is that blood and urine pesticide/metabolite biomarkers used in some studies only re flected the past 48 h of exposure,135so that even repeated measures in pregnancy may not have accu- rately re flected the true dose to developing neuro- logical structures. Another attenuating in fluence may be negative confounding by nutrients in the fruit and vegetables that contribute pesticides, which could counter-balance the toxic impact of the pesticide givensome evidence that nutrients like folate are associated with reduced risk for autism. 141,142 In summary, the results from these studies suggest that several types of pesticide exposures may, for somechildren, be part of what causes the emergence of autism. A period of susceptibility in early pregnancy was suggested by one study, but this trend did not holdin other studies and requires con rmation. Importantly, many pesticides have not been studied in relation to autism, though most give rise to neurotoxicity. 143 Continued study of varying pesticides, combinations, and developmental windows is necessary to substan- tiate the current evidence of the deleterious effects ofpesticide Polychlorinated Biphenyls, Flame Retardants, Non-Stick Chemicals, Phthalates, and Bisphenol A Persistent organic pollutants are synthetic, carbon- based chemicals that accumulate in the environment and in human tissues, including legacy chemicals thathave since been banned along with chemicals currentlyparity, and pet ownership during prenatal period Braun et al.136Cincinnati, Ohio, USA2003 - 2006175 Cohort Health Outcomes and measures of theEnvironment (HOME) StudySocial Responsive- ness Scale at ages 4 and5 yearsContinuous autism phenotypeMaternal age at delivery, race, marital status, education, insurance status, IQ, serumcotinine, and employment, parity, household income, prenatal vitamin use, depressive symptoms in2nd trimester, and HOME scoreLaboratory analysis of serum sample during gestation, usually around 16 weeks, lipid normalizedPregnancy aResults in Figure 7 . bSample size is presented by a single number when statistical models included a continuous measure of autism phenotype, or, otherwise, as the number of cases/controls. cAutism data sources are described in Table 2 . dAutism diagnostic and psychometric tools are described in Table 3 . eVariables in parentheses were evaluated but not included in nal models because they did not impact results.

Persistent organic pollutants that were banned by the Stockholm Convention in 2001 include PCBs (heat-stable lubricants used throughout industry) and some dioxins (such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-dioxin, TCDD, the dioxin present as a contaminant in the used as flame- retardant additives to textiles and plastic casings of electronics) and per fluorinated compounds (PFCs, used as non-stick coatings in cookware and outdoorgear). Some of the pesticides reviewed in the previous section are persistent organic pollutants (e.g., DDT). Also covered in this section are two groups of non- persistent organic pollutants: bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates. Although these chemicals are not persis- tent, that is, they are readily cleared from the humanbody in part because they are water soluble, exposureis ubiquitous and continuous, so is important to examine for chronic effects. BPA is used in plastics and resins, including linings of canned foods, receipts,toys, and medical equipment. High-molecular-weight phthalates are plasticizers, used in medical tubing, food packaging, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics andflooring. Low-molecular-weight phthalates are used in cosmetics, fragrances, and medication coatings. These persistent and non- persistent chemical groups are all suspected to interferewith hormone systems andhave thus been termed endocrine-disrupting chemi- cals. Some chemicals cov-ered in other sections of this review, such as pesticides, also act to disrupt the endocrine system. Such chemicals have been shown to mimic, block, oralter hormone signaling of steroid hormones, oxytocin, or thyroid hormones. 145For example, PBDEs are structurally similar to thyroid hormone, which isrequired during discrete periods of neurodevelop-ment. 146Other pathophysiological mechanisms of these organic pollutants include neurotoxicity or immunotoxicity.147-149Epigenetic mechanisms are suggested by a mouse study that demonstrated trans- generational impacts on social recognition following BPA exposure,150and the involvement of mitochon- drial impairment is supported by the demonstration that a flame retardant interfered with brain mitochon- drial function in mice.151Human epidemiologicalstudies have widely examined a role for these chem- icals in various neurodevelopmental end points, with reviews concluding a plausible role in attention-de cit disorders121and autism.152 Diet is a predominant source of exposure for many persistent pollutants (PCBs, PBDEs, and PFCs), because they bioaccumulate in predatory sh and breast milk. In addition, these chemicals can be widely present ininterior spaces because they are not chemically bound in the products in which they are used, and so are readily liberated into the environment, leading to further inges-tion or inhalation. Examples here include PBDEs in indoor dust after release from computers or carpets and phthalates released from fragrances and scented prod-ucts. All of these chemicals, whether banned or not, or persistent or not, are near-universally detected in repre- sentative human biological samples from the U.S. 12 Some chemicals are even increasing in body burden, forexample, PBDE flame retardants 153and some, but not all, types of phthalates.154Body burdens of PBDE flame retardants may correspond to regulatory standards: dustbiomarker levels are especially high in California, where flammability standards had until recently been more strict than in the U.S. as a whole. 155Additional drivers of exposure include lifestyle patterns, such as greater consumption of canned food or having older homeupholstery or electronic equipment, and neighbor- hood, because of proximityto polluting sources, and sosociodemographic and neighborhood factors are plausible confounders for this question. 156Calendar time and child-rearing practi- ces are similarly important: maternal age, because older moms were living in times prior to chemical bans andincurred more years to accumulate body burdens, and birth order and breast-feeding practices, in part because breast-feeding is one of the most effective methods ofexcreting lipophilic chemicals. 157 Five studies, from different countries and using different valid measures of autism diagnosis or the continuous autism phenotype, met our inclusion cri-teria ( Table 11 ). Two studies used parent questionnaire to measure exposures, 58,89and three studies used prospective biomarkers pertaining to pregnancy,including a study for which one of us (A.K.) was an author. 136,137,158Pregnancy biomarkers are especially valid for the persistent pollutants (PCBs, PBDEs, andThese persistent and non-persistent chemical groups are all suspected to interfere with hormone systems and have thus been termed endocrine- disrupting chemicals.

In contrast, biomarkers for phthalates and BPA may incur more measurement error because they only re flect exposure for a few days instead of the entire relevant period of development. Still, biomarkers of phthalates and BPA have strengths of being objective, quantitative meas-ures, and in one study were collected more than onetime in pregnancy. 136All of these studies adjusted for important sociodemographic confounders, and all except for one adjusted for maternal age.58 Associations between PCBs (individual congeners and mixtures) and autism were scattered above and below the null and so were not consistent with a causalrelationship. Associations between PCBs and autism from a pilot study in Finland were mostly elevated; however, the modest sample (75 children with autism)did not allow for precise, conclusive results, and thelack of adjustment for birth order may have slightly biased these ndings ( Fig. 8 all from one publication, showed mixed ndings, with suggestions that some congeners may be associ- ated with more autistic behaviors (e.g., PBDE-28),whereas others may be associated with fewer autistic behaviors (e.g., PBDE-85 and PFOA) ( Fig. 8 , red). 136 Associations between autism and BPA from two studies were not consistent with a causal associa- tion.136,158Several phthalate congeners, in contrast, appeared associated with increased autism across threedifferent studies, although results were not consistentacross these studies and most lacked the statistical precision for conclusive results. 58,136,158 In summary, the emerging literature on autism and persistent and non-persistent endocrine-disrupting com- pounds does not allow de nitive conclusions regarding ar o l ef o rP C B s , flame retardants, non-stick chemicals, or BPA, while results for phthalates are more suggestive that exposures to some phthalates may be risk factors for autism. Given the dif culty in measuring exposure, especially for phthalates and BPA, which have shorthalf-lives, it is not possible to rule out any of these chemicals from causing neurodevelopmental harm. Their known endocrine-disrupting properties are also areason not to dismiss concern regarding these chemicals. Two caveats deserve mention. Studies to date have focused on the important prenatal period, yet if trans-generational impacts are implicated via epigenetic mechanisms, these studies may completely miss the relevant exposures that occurred for parents orgrandparents. Lastly, the studies to date have not addressed numerous other chemicals that disrupt hor- mone signaling and are ubiquitous in the environment, such as dioxin and the anti-bacterial compound,triclosan. Susceptibilities and Heterogeneity of Response to Xenobiotic Exposures Greater Susceptibility in Males or Females Being a male is one of the strongest predictors of being diagnosed with autism, especially higher- functioning autism, and while reasons for this have been explored,159-162there is currently no de nitive explanation. Given the link between autism and child 's sex together with the endocrine activity of many environmental chemicals, there is good reason toexplore sex-speci c susceptibility to the impacts of xenobiotic exposures (i.e., sex modi cation or inter- action). While greater susceptibility may be a priori expected in males as a driver of their higher autism prevalence, either sex may be more susceptible. Addi- tionally, whether males or females are more susceptiblemay vary from one chemical to another. Some studies reviewed here have addressed suscep- tibilities in males vs. females, without nding clear trends. 70,136The very strength of the child sex -autism association presents a research challenge because the number of females with autism in any given study will be much smaller than the number of males, limiting thestatistical power to assess sex /C2environment interac- tions. This is an important research area, and future studies may need to over-sample females with autismor pool data across studies to better answer questionsabout sex-speci c susceptibilities. Genetic Susceptibilities It is likely that the autism risk associated with a given xenobiotic exposure will differ based on the child 's genes or the mother 's genes. Genetic polymorphisms of possible relevance include those encoding proteinsinvolved in the metabolism or biological activation of the xenobiotic, genes allowing improved resiliency to neurodevelopmental damages, or genes that confersome degree of autism risk that, when combined with xenobiotic damage, result in autism. Some examples of research in this area include a study demonstratinginteraction between traf c-related air pollutants and a Curr Probl PediatrAdolesc Health Care, Month ]]]] 31Fig 8.

Failing to account for genetic susceptibilities may result in the missed identi cation of an environmental risk factor: If a genetically sus- ceptible subgroup is combined with a non-susceptible group, the overall impact of the xenobiotic exposure onautism risk may be diluted or obscured. Future research is needed in this area, and will require expanded knowledge ofbiological pathways to selectcandidate polymorphisms and sufciently large sample sizes required to detect gene /C2 environment interactions. Different Responses Across the Spectrum of Neurodevelopmental Phenotypes Epidemiological studies of environmental chemicals and autism are also complicated by the fact that children diagnosed under the autism umbrella exhibit a very wide range of symptoms, level of disability, and co-occurringconditions. Furthermore, autism, like other psychiatric disorders, is diagnosed based on observable symptom clustering, not causal pathways, and so diagnosticdenitions may not be ideal for causal research, a phenomena termed \"etiological heterogeneity. \" 165-167 The environmental chemical risk factors for a given phenotype, such as high-functioning autism, may bequite different from risk factors for children with severe autism and intellectual disability. When multiple autism subtypes are combined in a given study, true causalimpacts may be diluted or masked. However, de ning a discrete disorder that re flects a common causal pathway remains elusive. The de ning variables are not known. A corollary to etiologic heterogeneity is that autism is one manifestation of developmental neurological dam- age, part of the broader set of neurodevelopmentalproblems including cognitive impairments, attention-decit disorders, sensory processing disorders, and more. Instead of studying autism in isolation, a more holistic approach would comprehensively de neneurodevelopmental impairments along multiple cross-cutting dimensions of behavior and abilities, and this nuanced \"phenome \"approach may aid in the further discovery of modi able, environmental chem- ical risk factors that may impact neurodevelopment. Conclusions The environment is not one entity, and the question about whether environmen tal exposures/compounds, as a whole, cause autism, is not suf cient to guide the primary prevention of autism. Instead, impor- tant questions address individual environmentalchemicals, during discrete critical periods of develop-ment for the fetus or infant, in relation to speci c phenotypic domains of autism symptoms. De nitive causal con- clusions cannot yet be drawn from this emerging body of liter- ature. So far, evidence suggeststhat some criteria air pollutants, some metals, and several pesti- cides, with suggestions that some volatile organic compounds (e.g., methylene chloride, trichloroethylene, and styrene) and phthalates, may be linked to autism. These associations have emergeddespite dif culties of study in this area, most notably the error in accurately measuring exposure concentra- tions and obtaining suf cient sample sizes. Increasingly, studies that examine exposures by developmental time period suggest that all windows are not equal. Although evidence for a discrete devel- opmental window of susceptibility for autism is in itsearly stages, results shown here suggest that early pregnancy may be a period of susceptibility to pesti- cides, whereas later pregnancy may be a period ofsusceptibility to criteria air pollutants. Different criticalwindows for different exposures is not unexpected given the various biological activities of environmental chemicals and the many, interwoven events of neuro-development, taking place during pregnancy and post- natal life, which, if disrupted, could manifest in autism symptoms. The volume of questions that remain are staggering, constituting an important gap in pediatric health. The number of chemicals not yet studied is large \u2014chemicals that are widely detectable in humans and have animal or mechanistic evidence of the endocrine, immune, epige- netic, and other pathophysiologies that may be involvedin causing autism. Even more daunting is the largeDenitive causal conclusions cannot yet be drawn from this emerging body of literature. Curr Probl PediatrAdolesc Health Care, Month ]]]] 33number of permutations of relevant research questions when it is considered that each chemical exposure isbest studied in combination with many critical windows of exposure, several autismphenotypic subdomains,each child 's gender, and a myriad of genetic suscepti- bilities, many of whichremain undiscovered. Lastly, the issue of potentiation due to chemical mixtures and autism, that is, whether the neurodevelopmentalresponse to chemical X differs when combined with chemical Y (and Z, and so on), has only been addressed in a handful of reports. In the meantime, clinicians have an important role to play in protecting the vulnerable brains of fetuses, infants, and children. Clinicians are on the front lines of autism diagnosis and can advocate for the equitableearly diagnoses that are so important in assisting children toward appropriate therapy, diagnoses that ultimately support the validity of research studies inthis area. The demonstrated racial/ethnic and social disparities in the timely recei pt of an autism diagnosis remain pressing public health problems. Cliniciansserve as the experts on autism symptomatology, raising observations that may provide the clues for future study, re ning the understanding of autism phenotype, and participating as autism experts inepidemiological research. C linicians advise pregnant women and parents toward avoiding harmful sub- stances in their environment. Yet more powerful thanthese is the leadership role of the clinician in advocating for a healthy environment and the societal prevention activities that have the most impact.Clinicians increasingly must have a strong voice in advocating for policies that protect the public 's health, including calls for research into environmental chem- icals, potentially modi able factors that may contrib- ute to autism or other neurodevelopmental problems in childhood.
