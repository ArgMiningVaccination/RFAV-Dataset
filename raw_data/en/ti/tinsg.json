The painting is by Jennifer Summerfield, an assistant health educator of Nganampa Health Council, South Australia and is used a s a health promotion instrument. The pupil of the eye represents the instructor, while the iris represents Umuwa, the administrativ e and training centre. The eyelashes represent the Aboriginal Health Workers learning about trachoma and general eye health. The foot prints represent the health workers returning to their communities symbolised by a flower shape in each corner. The flower petals repr esent members of the community surrounding the health workers who are discussing trachoma and its prevention in their communities. Th e smaller eyes represent blind and painful eyes and the white dots signify trachoma follicles. The elongated thin \"worm-like\" str uctures represent degrees of scarring tissue in the tarsal conjunctiva. Somewhat hidden toward the corners are acronyms use d for different stages of the disease.

Dr. Hugh Taylor is just the person to tell it. Dr. Taylor is probably the most influential expert in the field, and certainly the most tireless advocate for the WHO's elimination program. The book is a comprehensive tour de force\u2014the story spans centuries from the pharaohs to 2020, and from the laboratory to rural villages. What's more, it reads well ... TOMLIETMAN F.I. P , SANFRANCISCO Trachoma is a neglected, often blinding disease, of antiquity, common in neglected people. Hugh Taylor relates very poignantly the story, full of pathos, of the long battle to eliminate blindness from this scourge, from the face of the earth. He shows us that there is light at the end of the tunnel, with victory in sight. R P ARARAJASEGARAM FORMER PRESIDENT , INTERNATIONAL AGENCY FOR THE PREVENTION OF BLINDNESS CONSULTANT , W ORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION This is a unique book, which gives a very comprehensive and detailed insight into trachoma and its control. The history, impact and pathogenesis of trachoma, along with the clinical and epidemiological aspects of the disease, are covered in an excellent way, with numerous valuable references; the same goes for the overview of the evolution of trachoma classification systems, and a very didactic section on modern diagnostic techniques. The author also discusses many scientific and programmatic matters, often based on his vast field experience. A very valuable reference book for all those who want to learn much more about trachoma and its control. BJORN THYLEFORS FORMER DIRECTOR , PROGRAMME FOR THE PREVENTION OF BLINDNESS , W ORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION I am delighted to stress the importance of this book that adopts a comprehensive approach to stress the very special nature of trachoma, a disease that shifted from a global threat to a marker of poverty. SERGE RESNIKOFF COORDINATOR , C HRONIC DISEASES PREVENTION & M ANAGEMENT WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION This book on trachoma is a great work. I believe it is an important milestone in the study of trachoma. In recent years many people speak about trachoma but often know very little about the disease. I do hope this book will become an important reference for all. K K ONYAMA DEPARTMENT OF OPHTHALMOLOGY JUNTENDO UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE , TOKYOThis book, by a leading ophthalmologist who has devoted more than 30 years to research on trachoma, is the first monograph on trachoma\u2014the leading infectious cause of blindness\u2014to have been published since the 1960's. It includes a fascinating account of the history of this ancient disease, detailed descriptions of its clinical features, pathogenesis and treatment, and a critical review of strategies for its control. It looks forward to the prospects for its elimination as a cause of blindness by the year 2020, as proposed by a Global Alliance convened by the World Health Organization. It will be of interest to ophthalmologists, public health and infectious diseases specialists, and all those interested in the history of medicine and the control of infectious diseases. DAVID MABEY LONDON SCHOOL OF HYGIENE & T ROPICAL MEDICINE . Among the infectious causes of blindness, trachoma continues to be the leading contributor globally and there is no single source of information on this important subject that is current. This monograph by Hugh Taylor fills this void and should immediately find a niche for itself. The author's background and wide experience in trachoma makes him uniquely qualified to undertake this onerous task, which he has completed most efficiently and elegantly. This is a \"must\" for all ophthalmology and public health libraries as well as for all professionals involved in the fight against trachoma globally. This book will remain a magnum opus on trachoma for many years to come. GN R AO PRESIDENT , INTERNATIONAL AGENCY FOR THE PREVENTION OF BLINDNESS CHAIRMAN , V ISION 2020 This book sheds light on the past, present and future of trachoma control. Professor Taylor has been involved in the front line of trachoma control, and represents a perfect blend of basic researcher and public health officer, ideally placed to successfully deliver the fascinating story of trachoma across decades and countries. SILVIO P M ARIOTTI COORDINATOR , G LOBAL ALLIANCE AGAINST TRACHOMA , WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION This book is the most comprehensive review of trachoma, a disease that has afflicted mankind for centuries and which continues to cause disabling blindness throughout many countries of the world. Dr. Hugh Taylor captures the history of this disease and the advances that have been made over the years in diagnosis, treatment, and control. The book objectively reviews what is known about the epidemiology and pathogenesis of trachoma and how we can utilize effective interventions including advancements in diagnosis and treatment to limit its spread. This book will become a classic for all scientists and clinicians in helping achieve WHO's plans for trachoma elimination by 2020. THOMAS QUINN DIRECTOR , JOHNS HOPKINS CENTER FOR GLOBAL HEALTHTRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:17 PM Page viForeword TRACHOMA IS AN ancient disease and has long been a major cause of ocular discomfort and visual disability and blindness. It was once prevalent around the globe. Indeed, the right of passage most feared by would-be immigrants to the United States at the turn of the 20th century was their eye examination on EllisIsland\u2014evidence of active trachoma precluded their entry. Happily, trachoma has receded from most wealthy countries, presumably with improvements in living standards, particularly better hygiene practices. But it remains prevalent among the economically \"bottombillion\". As Professor Taylor points out, trachoma still remains a significant problem in many Aboriginalcommunities in the Australian outback. Research during the past four decades has shed important new insights into the reasons trachoma persists among the poor\u2014and given the world a proven intervention, SAFE (\"Surgery for trichiasis, Antibiotics, Facialcleanliness and Environmental improvement\") that properly applied allows populations to leap-frog thepoverty trap and control, if not entirely eradicate trachoma as a blinding entity. Professor Hugh Taylor has spent much of his remarkable career at the center of the trachoma research revolution and played a major role in the development and application of all four components of the SAFEstrategy. This authoritative and richly illustrated text, the first full explication on trachoma's origins,consequences and control in decades, is destined to be a classic in the field. Alfred Sommer MD, MHS Dean Emeritus and Professor of Ophthalmology, Epidemiology and International HealthThe Johns Hopkins UniversityAbout the author HUGH RINGLAND TAYLOR , AC, was born in Melbourne and trained in ophthalmology. After first working on trachoma with the late Fred Hollows, he became a faculty member of the Johns Hopkins University where he conducted pioneering studies on trachoma and other causes of blindness over 13 years. In 1990, he becamethe Ringland Anderson Professor of Ophthalmology at the University of Melbourne, and later the foundingdirector of the Centre for Eye Research Australia (CERA). In 2008, he became the Harold Mitchell Professorof Indigenous Eye Health at the University of Melbourne. He has studied trachoma in five continents forover 30 years, advised the World Health Organization and served the International Agency for the Preventionof Blindness, Vision 2020 and the International Council of Ophthalmology. He is Australia's most publishedophthalmologist with more than 650 scientific papers, 16 books and over 60 book chapters. He wasappointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) in 2001.

Hugh R TaylorMelbourne, December 2007Summary THIS BOOK IS a comprehensive review of trachoma, from antiquity through to the present, with predictions about the future elimination of this ancient blinding scourge. Known since Pharaonic times, this infectiouscause of blindness has been targeted by the World Health Organizaton (WHO) for elimination by 2020.Currently 84 million children in 56 countries are affected and 1.5 million adults are blinded by trachoma. Trachoma: A Blinding Scourge from the Bronze Age to the Twenty-first Century reviews the historical evolution of our understanding of trachoma, its clinical appearance, its epidemiology, the disease processesinvolved and the four-pronged SAFE Strategy used to combat the disease. TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:17 PM Page xviiipublished a book in English in 1967 that detailed his work on trachoma vaccine development. The WHO has published a series of very useful and important manuals that deal with specific technical or practical aspectsof trachoma control, and the quadrennial series of reports presented at international chlamydial meetings isan outstanding source of information. This book tells the story of trachoma. It starts with the ancient writings and understanding of trachoma. It outlines the explosion of trachoma in Europe associated with the Napoleonic Wars and the IndustrialRevolution, and the social impact that trachoma had including the development of specialisation withinmedicine. The second chapter reviews trachoma in the 20th century, with the development of controlprograms and the elimination of trachoma from the developed world. The next three chapters review theclinical recognition and grading of trachoma, the laboratory methods for diagnosis and the biology ofchlamydia. Chapter six reviews the epidemiology and individual risk factors which highlight facial cleanlinessin children as the final common pathway. The next chapter examines the pathology and the importance ofcellular immune response and repeated episodes of reinfection. Fifty years of work on trachoma vaccines isthen explored in chapter eight, followed by a review of the integrated approach to trachoma control, theSAFE Strategy, including the use of azithromycin. The concluding chapter evaluates the current status oftrachoma and its gradual decrease in a number of areas over time. I have tried to complete the circle betweenspecific and targeted interventions and general socioeconomic development. In this final chapter, I also addresssome of the issues around the persistence of trachoma in Australian Aboriginal communities. Introduction To know trachoma well one must have examined, treated and followed up thousands of cases KARL LINDNER , 1949 THE YEAR 2007 marks a number of milestones for trachoma. Chlamydia trachomatis , the bacterium that causes trachoma, was first identified in 1907 and first cultured in 1957. The W orld Health Organization (WHO) launched the Global Initiative to Eliminate Blindness from Trachoma (GET 2020) as a public healthproblem in 1997. Data from 2002 show the number of people who are blind from trachoma is decreasing. One hundred years ago trachoma was a major problem worldwide. Before then, it had been a major political problem in European countries as a significant cause of infection and disability in troops, and alsoamong the urban poor in slums created by the Industrial Revolution. Trachoma has now been eliminated frommost developed regions, but the disease still affects some 84 million people in 56 developing countries. Although great progress has been made, there is still much work to do to eliminate trachoma as a major blinding disease. Those areas in which trachoma persists are the most difficult to address. Trachoma hasbeen named as one of the major diseases in the new WHO initiative on Neglected Tropical Diseases and itscontrol is closely linked with a number of the Millennium Development Goals. The distribution ofazithromycin by Pfizer is a model for successful public-private partnerships, a key strategy for povertyalleviation and disease control promoted by the United Nations (UN) Global Fund. I am not sure if I live up to Lindner's standards, but in this book I reflect on what I have learnt about trachoma from my experiences, both in the field and the laboratory. I wanted to review findings over the last30 years and indicate how they have helped us combat the disease. I explore what old information has beenrediscovered and what new information has changed the way we understand or deal with trachoma. Werethere lessons from the past that we had overlooked? I have also tried to assess whether we were actuallymaking the best use of new knowledge at our disposal. This approach brings together a diverse range of information about trachoma, from cellular and molecular biology to public health policy, and places this information in a historical context. This is not a simpletextbook, nor a technical book on the microbiology or molecular genetics of chlamydia. I have tried to conveyan understanding of trachoma that would be useful for those working in the field, and for those responsiblefor designing, supervising or funding trachoma control activities. By introducing a somewhat broader socialand historical context, I hope this book will be of interest to a wider audience working in public health andsocial development. In addition, it should constitute an important summary of the subject and therefore finda place in the libraries of ophthalmologists and medical schools. Currently there are no books devoted to trachoma, although chapters on the subject appear regularly in textbooks. The last major book on trachoma published in English is MacCallan's in 1936.

Trachoma is a disease that has come with us from antiquity. It is discussed in ancient Egyptian texts, written on papyrus and even in early writings from ancient China. Chronic infection with theorganism, Chlamydia trachomatis , can lead to blindness. The disease came to prominence in Europe during the Napoleonic Wars when tens of thousands of British and French troops returnedwith trachoma after fighting in Egypt. It spread rapidly through the armies of Europe where thetroops lived in crowded and unsanitary barracks (1). Other papers may start with: One quarter of all blindness in the world is due either directly or indirectly to trachoma. At present, it affects some 300 to 500 million people, with some seven to 10 million peoplewho are blinded by this disease. Although once common worldwide, over the last centurytrachoma as a blinding disease has disappeared from most cities and towns of developedcountries and today is most commonly found in the poorest arid rural areas ofunderdeveloped countries. These are the areas where hygiene is the most inadequate (2). CHAPTER ONE Trachoma is an ancient disease and a weapon of mass destruction We have to try hard and to practise, so that we can describe the past, recognize the present and predict the future HIPPOCRATES , 420 BCTRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:17 PM Page xxiihygiene in these early settlements would have been key determinants for the development of what werecognise as trachoma\u2014the endemic blindingdisease. Blinding trachoma is seen to be differentfrom occasional episodes of chlamydial inclusionconjunctivitis that still continue to occur aroundthe world, even in the most developed countries. This early settlement and the historical trade routes that developed westward along the northand south coasts of the Mediterranean andeastward into Asia give plausible means for the\"spread\" of trachoma that accompanied humanagriculture and settlement and the building ofhouses and villages. Centuries before Christ,trachoma was probably well known andwidespread in the four great river valleys thatsheltered the development of early civilisations;those of the Yangtze and Hwang Ho in China, theIndus and Ganges in South Asia, the Euphrates andTigris in the Middle East and the Nile in Egypt (6). References to trachoma in China date back to the 27th century BCwhen Emperor Huang Ti Nei Ching had surgery for trichiasis (8). Inscribed animal bones and tortoise shells dating from the16th to 11th centuries BCinclude references to a range of eye disorders (8) (see Figure 1.2).However, the earliest specific references totrachoma that could be found by Eugene Chan (Chen Y aozhen 1899-1986), both a great ophthalmologist and a great Chinese scholar , date back to the Northern and Southern Dynasties(420-581 AD). He noted the traditional Chinese terms for trachoma included \"pepper-seed-likelesions\" and \"millet-like granules\". Pannus andtrichiasis were well known. The use of coppercompounds and the rubbing of the lids withoctopus bone and garlic were traditional Chinesetreatments of great antiquity. Trachoma is alsobelieved to have existed in Sumeria in the BronzeAge and epilation forceps, dating from around2600 BC, were found in Ur (9) (see Figure 1.3). Writings attributed to the Indian surgeon Susruta (between 1000 and 500 BC), describe the roughening and thickening of the inner surface ofthe eyelids as well as the development of trichiasisand entropion (10). Treatment involved scarification followed by a variety of topicalmedications including ginger , rock salt, honey, sulpharsenic acid and ferrous sulphate. Trichiasiswas treated with either surgical incision of the lid,with everting sutures made of human hair, orcauterisation of the lash follicles. Julius Hirschberg (1843-1925) wrote an amazing 11 volume history of ophthalmologybetween 1889 and 1905. Hirschberg was apractising ophthalmologist who lived in Berlin butalso travelled widely. He read ancient and modernGreek, Latin, English, French, Italian and Arabic.Frederic Blodi did ophthalmology an enormousservice by translating this opus into English (11).This work has provided an enormously rich sourceof information on the evolution and developmentof ophthalmology from the earliest recordsavailable at the time. It benefits greatly fromHirschberg's ability to read the original documents.He pays particular attention to the two major eyediseases\u2014trachoma and cataract. Trachoma was common and well recognised in ancient Egypt. The Ebers' papyrus was discoveredin Thebes in 1872 by George Ebers. It is the oldestTRACHOMA IS AN ANCIENT DISEASE 3 More recent papers may quote figures from the2002 estimate by the World Health Organization(WHO) of 84 million people with active trachomaand 7.6 million with trichiasis (3). However, the history and evolution of our understanding of trachoma is more complex and much more interesting. Furthermore, it isimportant to have an understanding of theevolution of our knowledge of trachoma, as itcontains many clues that are relevant to today'sefforts to finally eliminate this ancient blindingdisease so well described by Hippocrates in 420 BC. The early history of trachoma Some have asserted that trachoma first arose in thepeoples in Central Asia and then spread eastwardsinto Asia and westwards into the Middle East andthe Mediterranean (4). It seems more likely thattrachoma as such was first seen in the earlysettlements in Mesopotamia, the so-called \"FertileCrescent\". The ocular strains of chlamydia firstdiverged from the genital strains some two millionto five million years ago, about the same time asHomo habilis and Homo erectus evolved (5) (see Figure 1.1). The strains of chlamydia that affect other species separated even earlier. The variation within thetrachoma biovar of Chlamydia trachomatis developed about a million years ago. This showsthe very early association of chlamydial ocularinfection and human evolution. Human ocularchlamydial infection must have been sufficientlycommon to allow chlamydia themselves to surviveover time and must date back some millions ofyears. Homo sapiens did not evolve until about 120,000 years ago and did not aggregate into largecommunities until the end of the last Ice Age about10,000 BC. People aggregated in the earliest settlements and towns that were formed inMesopotamia. The increased crowding and poor2TRACHOMA LEFT Figure 1.1 The evolutionary history of Chlamydiales (Stephens 2002 (5); courtesy, Richard Stephens).

Aristophanes' play relates thatAsclepius, the god of healing, had tried to restorethe vision of Neoclides with an ointment of fig treesap, garlic, lentisk and vinegar. This ointment wasapplied to the everted eyelids but it causedconsiderable pain. Plutous opted for an alternatecure for his blindness and with the help of thedaughter of Asclepius, Panaceia, he covered hishead with a purple cloth and two snakes emergedfrom the temple and licked his eyelids and restoredhis vision. Plato wrote at length about healthy lifestyles and gave advice as to where one should live to reducethe likelihood of developing ophthalmia. Platosuggested ophthalmia was contagious and Aristotle(384-322 BC) went further and concluded that one could catch trachoma just by looking at someonewho was infected. This controversy about the\"infectivity\" of trachoma flared again in the early1800s (16) and was not really settled until Pasteur's work in the 1880s led to the identification ofbacteria and the establishment of germ theory . Ophthalmia or trachoma was an important cause of morbidity and vision loss in ancient times.As Hirschberg points out, almost every medicalwriting that has survived from ancient timesincluded at least some reference to trachoma, itsdiagnosis or treatment (10). Hippocrates (460-380 BC) is the earliest of the Greek physicians whose writings are known. Thereare some 70 books attributed to him and theseinclude descriptions of trachoma, which he termed\"ophthalmia\" and \"lippitudo\" (bleary or drippingeye). He recognised the fig-like appearance of theeverted upper lid and \"trichosis\", the term he usedfor inturned lashes. In About the Air , he gave advice to avoid the cold winds from the northwhich caused severe ophthalmia, as well as thewarm south winds which would cause a wet andmild ophthalmia. In one of his famous aphorisms(Aphorism VI 31), he stated that ocular disease canbe cured by drinking wine, by bathing, purging,bloodletting, or by a cleansing medication. Hippocrates describes four eye operations only; three were for trachoma ( About Vision). The first was for the scarification of the granularconjunctiva, ophthalmoxysis. This procedure used adense, clean piece of wool wrapped around awooden stick to scarify the everted tarsalconjunctiva. The abraided bloom\" to form an eschar or scab.Second, if the lids were markedly thickened,Hippocrates recommended the surgical excision ofas much of the fleshy granular tissue as possible.This was followed by cauterisation with a heatediron and copper bloom treatment. The thirdoperation Hippocrates described was a suturingmethod to correct entropion and trichiasis. Twohair sutures were passed through the lid and tiedtightly to evert the lid. The sutures would eventuallyslough out. His last eye operation was an anteriorchamber paracentesis to drain a hypopyon. He alsoadvocated local bloodletting incising the scalp inthe parietal area (Common Diseases ). This led to two millennia of almost tortuous incisions,bloodletting, cupping and leaches variously appliedto the temple, scalp and neck. Aurelius Cornelius Celsus (25 BCto 50 AD), a Greco-Roman physician who lived in Provence, isbest known for describing the four cardinal signs ofinflammation. He wrote an encyclopaedia ofmedicine that included descriptions of cataract andknown \"book\" on medicine and was written in the18th Dynasty between 1553 and 1550 BC(see Figure 1.4). The papyrus basically contains acollection of prescriptions and only in passing doesit mention various diseases by name. It is thoughtthat there were companion volumes on diagnosisand surgery that have not survived. One-tenth ofthe 700 or so prescriptions in the Ebers' papyruswere to treat eye disease. Much Egyptian medicinewas based on topical treatment, a variety ofbiological products including onions, myrrh andgazelle excrement. These were to be applied to theeye with the feather of a vulture. Blood from lizardsor bats was to be applied to the eyelid afterepilation, the only surgical procedure mentioned inthe papyrus that has survived. Mineral componentssuch as lead sulphate, lead acetate and kohl (madeout of soot or finely ground antimony powder)were also applied to the eye. It is interesting to notethat many of these remedies are still in traditionaluse in Egypt today (12). Epilation forceps have been found in tombs of the New Empire Kingdom (1570-1070 BC) as well as pots containing copper and zinc oxide, and leadand antimony sulphates (4). These pigments areused to make \"kohl\", a mascara-like substancecommonly used to outline the eyes, as well as totreat conjunctivitis. MacCallan also refers to thefuneral stele belonging to the earliest knownophthalmologist, Pepi-Ankh Iri, who served thecourt of the Sixth Dynasty in about 2500 BC. Although there are many biblical references to eye disease and blindness, trachoma is notspecifically mentioned in the bible. However, whenSt Tobias used fish bile to cure his father Tobit ofblindness, he was probably treating trachoma (13,14) (see Figure 1.5). Fish bile and bile from animals was an accepted treatment for trachoma.Goat bile was later used by the Romans to treattrachoma and eel and ox bile were widelyadvocated to treat eye disease in 16th and 17thcentury Europe. Sterile isotonic solutions aredifficult to make and store and have only becomeavailable in the last century . Before then, people used naturally available solutions: blood, urine,breast milk or bile. Their use was widelyrecommended and practised, although the conceptsof sterility and isotonicity were unknown. Ophthalmia was well known to the Greeks and is referred to in several of the plays written by theAthenian playwright Aristophanes (466-388 BC), including Plutus (388 BC) and the Frogs (405 BC), and in the writings of Plato (427-347 BC). Trachoma became particularly troublesome during the longsiege of Athens during the Peloponnesian War (431-414 BC) (15). This was a major war between the two leading states of Greece, Athens and Sparta.It marked the zenith of the power of Athens, thelosers. The siege caused the prolonged over - crowding of people within the Athenian city walls.

The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg \u00a9 The State HermitageMuseum). Figure 1.4 A sheet from as well as Muslims. Honian ibn Is'hag (808-873 AD) (also known as Johannitius), a Christian physician in Baghdad, wrote \"The ten treatises of the eye\". He was thefirst to write in detail about pannus or \"sabal\". Thecorneal vascularisation in trachoma had not beendescribed by the Greeks or Romans. Arabophthalmologists such as Al Razi (850-924 AD) (also known as Rhazes) and Ammar ibn Ali Al-mawsili (996-1020) described several differentsurgical methods to remove pannus. Al Raziremonstrates \"in eye inflammation remember toevert the lids and you will find trachoma\". He alsogave a description of snow blindness and describedhow the reflection of the sun's rays contributed tothis condition (19). The classic Arabic textbook on ophthalmology was written by Isa ibn Ali (d. 1010 AD, also called Al-Kahh\u00e3l, the ophthalmologist). He lived inBaghdad and wrote an encyclopaedic textbook ofophthalmology that survived intact. It was largelybased on the extensive Greek writings and was thefirst systematic textbook of ophthalmology inwhich the chapters followed an anatomic sequence:each chapter was arranged systematically in whichmore important and frequent diseases such astrachoma, cataract and conjunctivitis received moreattention (18). Probably the most famous of theArabic writers was the Persian physician andphilosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna) (980-1037) whowrote 450 books, although his description oftrachoma is quite cursive (18). Arabic texts emphasise the important distinction between acute ophthalmia and chronic, blindingtrachoma. The \"oculists\" of the 19th century hadforgotten this distinction and this became a point ofintensive debate and disagreement (18). Even the First W orld Health Organization Expert Committee on Trachoma in 1952 argued whether trachomaalways had to start with an episode of acutepurulent conjunctivitis, or whether it could startinsidiously (20). Eventually the Arabic learning and leadership started to wane in the 14th century . At the same time, the Renaissance was gainingstrength in southern Europe. Interesting insights into the management of trachoma come from documentary fragmentsfound in the genzia or storeroom of the Ben EzraSynagogue in Cairo. These documents were left byninth to 14th century Jewish doctors andpharmacists (21). They defined Ramad (trachoma)as having four stages, with the description of sagograins or a cut fig for active trachoma. To treattrichiasis they recommended either epilation orsurgery to remove lid skin. There were specialistswho only treated eye diseases and who chargedthree dirhems a week for treatment, although thepoor were treated for free. It had been suggested that St Francis of Assisi (1182-1226) acquired trachoma during the Crusades and became blind as a result (22). St Francis visited Palestine on at least two occasionsbetween 1218 and 1221. By 1223 he was describedas having severe trachoma and trichiasis (see Figure1.6). He was blind when he died in 1226. Many returning crusaders and pilgrims to the Holy Landsmay have returned with trachoma which theyintroduced to Italy and elsewhere in Europe in the13th century (22). During and after the Renaissance not much attention was paid to trachoma in Europe: The clear anatomical definition of granular conjunctivitis used by the ancient Greeks wasobscured by the Arabs who used rather uncleardescriptions and called the disease also scabies orherpes; only after Napoleon's campaign in Egypt wasthe Egyptian eye disease again the centre of medicalattention. However, due to the epidemics caused byNapoleon's campaign, surgical treatment of trachomawas re-introduced during the first third of the 19thcentury and dominated the treatment during the lastone-third of that century (18). The first European text on ophthalmology, Practica Oculorum, was by Benvenutus Grassus ofJerusalem who worked in a monastery in Salerno,Italy in the late 13th century. Salerno was the first medical school in Christian Europe (7).HeTRACHOMA IS AN ANCIENT DISEASE 7 trachoma (17). He used the Latin term \"aspritudo\"for \"rough\" to describe trachoma and he reiteratedthe subsequent development of trichiasis: This roughness is usually a sequelae of an inflammation. Occasionally it is more advanced,occasionally less developed. Sometimes the roughnessresults in severe tearing which in itself may increasethe roughness. In some patients it lasts only a shorttime, in others a long time or never disappears at all.In this chronic form some physicians scarify thethickened and hard lids (on the inner surface) with afig leaf or a rough probe or a knife. The lid should bedaily rubbed with medication. This should only beperformed in cases of chronic or severe roughness andshould not be frequently repeated. The same objectivecan be better achieved by diet and by appropriatemedication. We therefore recommend gymnastics,baths, frequent heating of the eye with warmcompresses, the food should be spicy and diluted. As a medication we recommend the imperialcollyrium (an ointment made of copper, iron, zinc and antimony) (10). If an ointment was not available the bile of a goat or very fine honey could be used. The treatmentpreferred by Celsus for trichiasis was cautery of thelashes with a hot iron needle\u2014ancient\"electrolysis\". He also recommended several othersurgical methods for treating trichiasis including lidsurgery using women's hair for sutures. Pedanius Dioscorides (40-90 AD), a Greek physician originally from Asia Minor but whopractised in Rome, was the first to use the Greekword \"trachoma\" to describe the roughness ofeverted eyelids. Dioscorides wrote the firstpharmacopoeia and describes some 600 medicinalplants. The pharmacopoeia included a wide rangeof animal, vegetable and mineral products to treattrachoma including copper sulphate fashioned inpencils and the use of a fig leaf to scarify the lid.Treatments ranged from egg white to the ear of amouse, mother's milk to frogs' blood. Claudius Galenus (Galen) of Pergamun in Turkey (129-200 AD), a practising physician who also couched for cataracts, built on and extendedthe work of Hippocrates and provided acomprehensive summary of Greek medicalknowledge. His writings were translated intoArabic and ultimately provided the foundation forrenaissance medicine in western Europe. Hiscollected works total some 22 volumes, but thisalso includes material attributed to him and almostcertainly written by others (10). In his work on theeye, \"De Oculis\", the term \"trichiasis\" is used forthe stages of trachoma aredescribed: psorophthalmia, (trachoma),sycosis, tylosis (roughly translated trichiasis). These four stages were morefully described by Aetius of Amida (502-575 AD). This staging foreshadows MacCallan'sClassification nearly 2000 years later. With the fall of the Roman Empire, the centre for medical knowledge, and in fact all westernlearning, moved to Alexandria and its fabledlibrary. Paulus of Aegina (625-690 AD) was a Greek physician who worked in Alexandria at thepeak of the Byzantine era. His MedicalCompendium in Seven Books became the standard Byzantine medical text. He described trachoma as adisease of the inner surface of the lids with fourstages, rough (trachoma), fig disease, scarred andtrichiasis. Wine and red iron ore were usedtopically followed by ointment. Cuttlefish bone ora raspatory (lid scraper) were used to smooth outthe roughness (18). Trichiasis was treated by the removal of an ellipse of skin by pressure necrosis ofa fold of lid skin held tightly between two tiedsticks. MacCallan found this method was stillcommonly used by the Fellahin in Egypt in the1900s (4) and it is still in use in Oman in the 1980s. Boldt concludes: Trachoma even in ancient times was a common and familiar disease, not only in Hellas Proper, and thecoasts of Asia Minor, Sicily and Lower Italy, but alsoin the Hellenic Empire of the Roman Emperors, which embraced the countries bordering on theMediterranean Sea (15). The development and spread of Islam from the eighth century led to a flowering of Arabicknowledge and discovery. Arab authors used theterm \"jarab\" (or scabies) to describe trachoma.Between 800 and 1300 ADsome 60 textbooks on ophthalmology were written in Arabic (18). Arabic scholars were centred in Baghdad, Cairo andDamascus where specialist eye clinics existed.Other centres included Jerusalem, and Cordobaand Seville in Spain. The authors included6TRACHOMA Figure 1.6 St Francis of Assisi (Annibale 20/12/07 2:17 PM Page 6amputated or blind soldiers who were forced to land in Sicily, where all were captured or killed. Asecond convoy of 200 blind soldiers was sent backto France in February 1799. They reached Francesafely, where some with dense corneal opacities hadoptical iridectomies that partly restored vision. InEgypt, the ophthalmia subsided during the winterof 1798 to 1799 and was less severe in thefollowing year, when it was overshadowed byepidemics of plague amongst the troops. The French physicians and military surgeons firmly believed that the ophthalmia was related tothe damp, cool evening air in the delta regions\u2014thenoxious night vapours\u2014but they also blamed thehot winds blowing from the south. The Frenchrejected the notion that ophthalmia could becontagious. In contradistinction, the English rapidlyformed the impression that ophthalmia wastransmissible. The argument about whethertrachoma was contagious raged until Pasteur'sdemonstration of the existence of bacteria and theproof for infectious agents contained in Koch'spostulates. In Egypt, further outbreaks of acute ophthalmia were also experienced by the Turkish Army thatinitially fought alongside the British, but laterfought against them. However, it was the BritishArmy who seemed to suffer most from the Egyptianophthalmia, and for whom copious documentationexists. After winning the Battle of the Nile, theBritish Navy blockaded the Egyptian coast fromAugust 1798 to September 1801. The British forceswere not affected by ophthalmia until their troopslanded outside Alexandria in March 1801; the\"sun-glare, dust of the desert and humidity\" caused the rapid development of ophthalmia. Eventhough it was believed that the ophthalmia mayinitially have been acquired from the \"myasm\",once established, cases were quickly recognised byBritish surgeons as being contagious. Edmonstonpublished a comprehensive account of hisexperience with troops returning from Egypt (27). TRACHOMA IS AN ANCIENT DISEASE 9 classifies the acute stage of ophthalmia as asanguine disorder to be treated with herbalremedies. Granular trachoma andtrichiasis were phlegmatic disorders; the first to betreated with excision of granules followed by theinstillation of egg whites and trichiasis by epilationor double armed compression lid sutures (23). Peterthe Spaniard (1210-76) also worked in Salerno. Hewas a Portuguese physician, later Pope John XXI,who wrote Liber de Oculu, a reiteration of the works of Galen, translated by Honian ibn Is'hag (7). European references to trachoma continued to appear in the 14th to 16th centuries including Guyde Chauliac (A opinion, they addednothing of value and reiterated previous work,often incorrectly (18). Writings of trachoma also originated from France, Germany , Holland, Spain, Portugal and England (15,24). It is hard to tell which reports actually deal with blinding trachomaand its sequelae as we know it, and which describethe effects of episodes or epidemics of acute orchronic untreated bacterial or viral conjunctivitis. A number of Europeans who had visited Egypt over the years commented on the presence ofophthalmia. In 1598 Baron Harant of Poljitz,Bohemia commented that the masses of flies onchildren' s eyes were the cause of their frequent eye infections (4). In 1683, the Venetian consul inCairo, Prospero Alpino, noticed the occurred summer(25). The Frenchman Tourtechot de Grengerlabelled Egypt the \"land of the blind\" after a visitin 1745 (25). The Egyptian or military ophthalmia Egypt and eye disease were branded into Europeanconsciousness during the Napoleonic Wars (1798-1815), starting with the Battle of the Nile and theEgyptian Campaign (1798-1802). Probably thebest review of the devastating epidemics of ocularinfections that first occurred amongst Europeantroops in Egypt in the 1800s is given by MaxMeyerhof in a presentation to the Royal Society ofMedicine in 1931 (26). He recounts how on 1 July1798 Napoleon Bonaparte landed near Alexandriawith 40,000 French troops and marched to Cairowhich he reached on 9 July (see Figure 1.7). Duringthe march through the Egyptian desert in themiddle of summer, the troops suffered fromdelirium and thirst (probable heat stroke),dysentery and night blindness. Without properprotection one must wonder whether there wassome component of photokeratitis, \"snowblindness\" associated with this \"night\" blindness.Certainly at this early stage in the campaignxerophthalmia is unlikely. After winning the Battleof the Pyramids on 21 July and occupying Cairo, amilitary hospital had to be established at Giza toaccommodate the wounded, those with dysentery,and those with ophthalmia. By 17 August that year, the soldiers, particularly those on guard duty, were advised to takeprecautions and protect their eyes during the coolermoist nights, because the humidity was thought tolead to \"inflammations of the eyes which withoutbeing dangerous, are very troublesome andpainful.\" These initial epidemics of ophthalmiawere probably due to infection with the Koch-Weeks bacillus ( Haemophilus aegyptius ) (26). However, the epidemic of ophthalmia spread rapidly and became more severe by late September.In one battalion, 125 of 350 men had ophthalmia,now complicated by marked lid swelling, chemosisand purulent discharge that together effectivelyblinded the affected soldiers. Despite their loss ofvision, they still had to man the trenches and \"theirmuskets were pointed at the enemy by theircomrades whose sight had not been affected.\"Although self-limited in many cases, other casespersisted for months (26). An expedition to upper Egypt had to be aborted in October 1798 when 1400 developed ophthalmia from a force of 3000 men. On evacuation \"therewere more blind men than there were healthy . Every soldier who was able to see or who had onlyone eye attacked served as a guide for severalcomrades who had, however, to carry their armsand baggage.\" Although initially most infectionsresolved without corneal involvement, by the endof the year many cases became \"complicated\" withcorneal lesions including \"specks and staphylomashypopions and other diseases\" (Assalini quoted byMeyerhof (26)). The intense sunlight was thoughtto be the principal cause of these changes. On 25 November 1798 Napoleon evacuated 1508TRACHOMA Figure 1.7 Napoleon leading his troops in the desert (Gerome, Jean-Leon 1863. Napoleon in Egypt. The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg \u00a9 The State Hermitage Museum). TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:17 PM Page 8islands ophthalmia rapidly spread to the civilian population. The same thing also occurred inBritain: After the peace in May 1802, the regiments were disbanded in England and the soldiers carried theinfection with them to the civil population, the lowerclasses of which did not at the time have such notionof cleanliness ... Ophthalmia appeared at the sametime in the most distant parts of Great Britain andthat particular modification of it, denominatedEgyptian ophthalmia is now (1806!) familiar toalmost every medical practitioner ... (Edmonstonquoted by Meyerhof (26)). The Egyptian ophthalmia continued to rage through military institutions. John Vetch (1783-1835) gave a compelling and celebrated descriptionof the incapacitating effect it had in the secondbattalion of the 52nd Regiment of Foot, where between August 1805 and August 1806, 606 of700 soldiers developed ophthalmia, 50 becamebilaterally blind and a further 40 unilaterally blind(16). He redescribed the granulations under the upper lid and the use of silver nitrate and coppersulphate. He was firm in his conviction of theinfectious nature of the disease, which hedemonstrated with a number of experiments bytransferring infection with infected secretions.Vetch enforced strict hygiene measures that reducedtransmission (28). In particular, he warned of the danger of the common use of towels and handbasins by soldiers and the need to isolate infectedsoldiers. In 1804 Sir Patrick Macgregor reported on the outbreak of ophthalmia in the Royal MilitaryAsylum, a boarding school for the children ofsoldiers who were serving overseas (29). Theinfection was apparently introduced by two Irishbrothers and over six months or so, nearly 400children were affected with ophthalmia with sixbecoming bilaterally blind and 12 losing one eye.Three of the nurses at the asylum were alsoaffected, again confirming the contagious nature of ophthalmia. British troops returned to Egypt in 1807 in an attempt to remove the T urks, who had taken control after the British had defeated the Frenchand then retired. During this ill-fated and under-resourced expedition the British Army was affectedby further outbreaks of ophthalmia, as did theBritish garrison in Sicily when the troops returnedto England (26). By 1811, 2317 British soldiers were bilaterally blind (30). Macgregor wrote that the ophthalmiahas \"crippled many of our best regular regiments tosuch a degree as for a time to render them unfit forservice\" (30). The British Army implementedseveral changes to curb ophthalmia. First, itrecognised that ophthalmia was communicable andtherefore all troops needed to be inspected and anycases were to be isolated. Second, it recognised theimportance of cleanliness and prohibited soldiersfrom using the same tub or water for washing.Faces had to be washed under running water andeach soldier was to be issued with his own towel.Third, bedding was seen to be an importantmethod of transmitting infection. Pillow cases wereintroduced and sheets and pillow cases had to bewashed regularly . These measures did much to curb the ophthalmia, although trachoma continued to bea problem throughout the British Army,particularly in centres where many troops passedthrough, such as Malta, Gibraltar and Cape Town.In the Crimean War (1861-67), 4% of all disabilityin the army was due to ophthalmia and 5% of thetotal discharges were because of blindness,although these rates were approximately half whatthey had been in the 1830s (30). In the 1882 expedition to Egypt, British troops were issued with blue veils and a pair of goggles.Their eyes were to be freely bathed in clean purewater. Again no two men should ever use the samewater and every man had to have his own towel,which was to be washed daily. This regime workedwell until the troops went into battle. Subsequently9% developed ophthalmia (30) and this has beenattributed to infection with the Koch-Weeksbacillus (4). Hundreds of thousands of British and other colonial soldiers, including those from Australia,passed through Egypt during the First W orld War (1914-18) (see Figure 1.9). Although trachoma wasstill widespread in the civilian population, few casesof conjunctivitis occurred in these soldiers (26,31). This is a testament to the improvement in standardsof British military hygiene from 1801 to 1915.However , in this war many Turkish prisoners of war did have trachoma (4). Although at the time theEgyptian ophthalmia was regarded as a singleTRACHOMA IS AN ANCIENT DISEASE 11 A division of 8000 men from India, half of whom were British and half Indian, had 1600soldiers develop ophthalmia in September andOctober 1801 and 158 became blind (26) (seeFigure 1.8). The descriptions of acute purulent conjunctivitis with corneal ulceration and perforation are entirelyconsistent with seasonal epidemics of gonococcalconjunctivitis more common in Egypt in the latterpart of the year. Differences were noted in therelative infrequency with which officers wereinfected and the need for frequent and carefulwashing of hands and eyes. Edmonston particularlynoted how infection was passed from one soldier to another, especially when they were confined inbarracks or in ships quarters when returning toEngland. Men sleeping in the same bed or even thesame room would be infected within 24 hours. Itwas common practice to have two or even fourmen share one bunk. However, Edmonston likeAristotle, suggested infection could be contractedjust by looking at a case, a view rejected by Vetch (16). An outbreak of acute conjunctivitis, \"Ophthalmia Gibraltariensis\", occurred inGibraltar which was identical to that seen in Egypt.It occurred as troops returned from Egypt and asimilar outbreak also occurred in Malta. In both10 TRACHOMA LEFT Figure 1.8 British troops around an oasis during the Egyptian Campaign (1801-1802). BELOW Figure 1.9 Australian troops encamped at Giza in 1915. On the left of Artillery Road are the lines of the first Australian DivisionalArtillery and on the right those of the thirdInfantry Brigade and the divisional engineersbehind them (Australian War Memorial, negativenumber CO1880). TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:17 PM Page 10men and the right eye was more frequently affected. Unlike catarrhal conjunctivitis that oftenstarted with a foreign body sensation, the firstsymptoms of contagious ophthalmia were amarked discharge and lid changes. Chemosis couldbe marked and coupled with marked swelling ofthe lids. The purulent discharge usually decreasedafter 12 to 14 days and with time, granular(follicular) changes could be seen in the conjunctiva(see Figure 1.11). The inflammation often extendedinto the cornea, causing ulceration and perforation.Pain was a prominent feature, particularly withcorneal involvement. The granular prominenceswere thought to be enlarged acini of theMeibomian glands . Much attention was directed to identifying and classifying the different types ofpain and defining specific therapies for each type ofpain (see T able 1.1). Mackenzie goes on to stress that \"in every case in which this ophthalmia has spread through aregiment, a school or a family , there has been a suspicion of actual contact by means either offingers of the patients or of towels or other utensilswhich they were in the habit of using in common\".Mackenzie sets out recommendations to preventthe spread of trachoma amongst soldiers (see Table1.2) and quotes Dr Vetch: \"Each company has aseparate room in which the intercourse among themen is necessarily great. Many things are used incommon ... washing their faces in the same water... and having recourse to the same towel\". Vetchsubsequently demonstrated the contagious natureof the purulent conjunctival mucous by applying itto the urethra and producing typical gonorrheae (16). Another surgeon of the times, Dr Guillie, also demonstrated the infectious nature by transferringpus from one eye to another (29). This interestingand confusing experimental differentiation ofophthalmia and gonorrhoea has been reviewedrecently by Benedek (35). Mackenzie recognised a third condition, ophthalmic granular conjunctiva, that also causedtrachoma. It was characterised by the thickened,fleshy and rough membrane lining the lids,especially the upper lid. He explained at somelength that this was not actual granulation tissue,but the granular appearance was due to changes inthe Meibomian follicles. W ithout treatment, the great thickening and roughness of the tarsalconjunctiva would lead to the total opacity of the cornea. In cases of granular ophthalmia, a good prognosis could be expected if there were\"sufficient clothing, proper diet, restriction fromintemperance, good air and judicious medicaltreatment\" (Hippocrates' aphorism restated).Treatment should include \"scarification of theconjunctiva, the application of escharotics and theuse of counter irritation\". Several days afterscarification or incision of the eyelids silver nitratepencil was to be applied to the tarsal conjunctiva.This should be repeated every two to three daysand then could be replaced with copper sulphate.The juice of the root holcus avenaceus and red precipitate salve could be used. It was considered ofutmost importance to keep a blister open on thenape of the neck until the eye was healed. Alternatively, a skilled surgeon can remove the roughened conjunctiva with a \"small and verysharp lancet shaped knife ... (using) a steadymotion\". Although this operation causes \"veryconsiderable pain\", one had to be careful not toremove too much conjunctiva as the consequentscarring would cause more damage to the corneathan the disease itself. All this was essentially thesame treatment as first recommended byTRACHOMA IS AN ANCIENT DISEASE 13 entity, there clearly was a problem of not being ableto differentiate between multiple causes ofconjunctivitis. With little in the way of therapy andno diagnostic resources other than signs andsymptoms, these Georgian military surgeons wereoperating in an uncharted area. Many infectionsmust have been mixed infections with chlamydiabeing concurrently passed with other bacteria,especially the also another outbreak ofrelatively mild ophthalmia that was both \"verycontagious and joined with a kind of influenza\"(26), possibly an adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis. Meyerhof subdivides acute catarrhal conjunctivitis caused by Koch-Weeks bacillus that may become purulent and severe, but usually resolves without permanent sequelae (usuallyseen in the early summer when flies increase andbefore the weather became too hot). 2. acute purulent conjunctivitis due to gonococcus and occasionally with secondary infection fromstreptococcus or pneumococcus. Untreated, thisfrequently led to corneal ulceration and perforation oropacification (usually seen in late summer after theflies return as the high temperatures fall somewhat). 3. post-gonococcal conjunctivitis with residual papillary hypertrophy and occasionally ectropion of the lids. Inthe 1930s he advocated a strong solution of silvernitrate to treat this or ectropion surgery for the moresevere cases. The clinical description of this issomewhat reminiscent of chronic staphylococcalconjunctivitis. 4. \"genuine\" trachoma with its four stages as classified by MacCallan. Meyerhof recognises the easy confusion of an initial acute bacterial conjunctivitis that was thenfollowed by the chronic blinding changes oftrachoma. He makes the point strongly thattrachoma can develop insidiously on its ownwithout the need for an antecedent acuteconjunctivitis. This was a particularly contentiouspoint and as mentioned, even in the 1950s somecontended that trachoma always started as acute,purulent conjunctivitis (20,33). The seasonal epidemics of flies in Egypt would have undoubtedly contributed to the rapid spreadof infection. The fly population is also likely tohave increased considerably around the soldiersand their camps. The accumulation of faeces andother rubbish around the hastily erected armycamps would have provided excellent breeding sites for flies. The Egyptian ophthalmia in Europe In 1830 William Mackenzie (1791-1868) (seeFigure 1.10) wrote A Practical Treatise on the Diseases of the Eye which became the definitive British textbook of ophthalmology for the next halfcentury (29). Mackenzie differentiated three typesof ophthalmia relevant to this discussion oftrachoma. He borrowed heavily on the experienceof Vetch and the other military surgeons. The ophthalmia or ophthalmia that\"attacked the British and French armies in Egypt(and) was an atmospheric puro-mucousconjunctivitis, but that it afterwards degeneratedinto a contagious, perhaps infectious, disease\".However, it was thought that catarrhal ophthalmiawas usually acquired because of atmosphericchanges, especially exposure to cold and wetconditions or to the night air (34). Wet feet werealso an important cause. It usually presented as amild conjunctivitis, but in severe cases chemosismay develop when bloodletting and purging wererequired. In some cases the cornea also wasinvolved and could perforate. The second condition characterised by Mackenzie was contagious ophthalmia or purulentophthalmia, also known asthe Egyptian ophthalmia. Theseverity of this purulentcondition was thought to varywith climate, the time of yearand the constitution or generalstate of health of those whenthey become affected. It wasless severe in women than12 TRACHOMA Figure 1.11 The effects of granular conjunctivitis \"combined with a hazed condition of the cornea which is marked or streaked by numerous conjunctival vessels carrying red blood.The greater numbers are situated on the upper part of theglobe, where the eyelid exerts most pressure. The term'Pannus' has been given to this complaint\" (Morgan J. Lectureson Diseases of the Eye. 2nd ed. London: Samuel Highley,1848). Figure 1.10 William Mackenzie (Lebensohn JE. An Anthology of Ophthalmic Classics. Baltimore: The Williams & Wilkins Company, 1969).TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:17 PM Page 12Hippocrates and passed on through Galen, the Arabic texts and subsequent Latin and Europeantranslations. Mackenzie also listed a number ofoperations that could be used to treat chronicentropion and trichiasis (see Table 1.3) Dr Julius Boldt, a regimental surgeon in the Prussian infantry, published an outstanding bookon trachoma. The English translation of this wasprepared by Herbert Parsons (1868-1957) andpublished in 1904 (15). He gives an excellent summary of the early European experience oftrachoma and many have subsequently used Boldtas a reference. Boldt traced the spread ofophthalmia through Europe. Following the landingof French troops at Sicily in 1801, Italian troopsstarted to be affected. An epidemic raged for yearsthrough Italy and peaked in 1813, but continuedintermittently until 1826. Italian troops stationed inHungary in 1809 took the infection with them. The Napoleonic W ars (1805-15) had Europe in upheaval with large armies hurriedly recruited,quartered in temporary barracks, marched acrossEurope and fighting with and against soldiers frommany countries. The Prussian Army was mobilisedin 1813 with universal conscription. The firstaffected Prussian troops had been stationed withFrench soldiers in the Baltic provinces. When thesetroops returned to their barracks after the Battle ofWaterloo (1815), ophthalmia spread extensivelyand then waxed and waned. From 1813 to 1821,25,000 Prussian troops were affected and 1100were bilaterally blind. Similar outbreaks occurredin the Austrian Army after 1815 with epidemicscontinuing until 1851. The Russian Army was notaffected until 1818, when ophthalmia firstappeared in its garrison in Warsaw, and by 1839nearly 80,000 Russian soldiers had been affected.Epidemics continued throughout the Crimean War(1854-6). A major epidemic broke out amongst the Dutch and Belgian Armies in 1815, but a further severeepidemic occurred in Belgium in 1834. This left4000 Belgian soldiers \"totally blind\" and another10,000 partially blinded. To solve this problem, allthe affected soldiers were discharged in 1834 and\"by this brilliant but disastrous experiment the lasttrace of doubt as to the contagiousness of trachomawas dispelled\" (15). This settled the controversy that had raged between the \"Contagionists\" andthe \"Anti-Contagionists\" or \"Compressionists\": The latter would not hear of any other cause for the extraordinary epidemic of trachoma in Belgium thanthe glare of light reflected from the white tunics of theinfantry, and the continuous compression of theirnecks by their cravats. Yet the epidemic was not in theleast diminished by complete change of uniform (15). This disaster in Belgium by and large partly led to the First International Congress of Ophthalmologyconvened in Brussels in 1857. Outbreaks of ophthalmia are recounted in the Swedish, Danish and Portuguese Armies through tothe 1860s. As with the British Army, the otherEuropean armies placed variable emphasis on theselection of recruits who were not infected, cleaningand disinfecting old barracks, separating patientswith ophthalmia and following the lines oftreatment already outlined.TRACHOMA IS AN ANCIENT DISEASE 15 14 TRACHOMA Table 1.1: Treatment options for the ophthalmiae, Mackenzie,1830 (29) 1. Bloodletting - to depress the strength of the response; (i) venous, (ii) arterial, (iii) leeches, (iv) the use of incision of the conjunctiva. It is \"the veriest of folly\" to bleed very large quantities of blood for Egyptian ophthalmia because it does not work well; one would need to remove too much blood to have a good effect and there are other milder forms of treatment. However, for chemosis, 10 to 40 ounc es of blood should be removed from the arm using a large orifice. The patient should sit or stand to ensure syncope. This should be repeated every 24 to 36 hours if the symptoms have not abated. Scarification of the conjunctiva should be repeated every second or third day. One to 20 leeches can be used over the temples and on the side of the nose. Consideration to be given to transection of the temporal artery, scarification or cupping at the temple. Consideration could also be given to cutting individual conjunctival blood vessels, 360 degree conjunctival resection or anteri or chamber paracentesis. 2. Purgatives - depletory to remove excess fluids, especially calomel and jalap, for the sympathetic effect. Purgatives should be used in all cases of trachoma.Local treatment - irrigation of the eye with lemon juice has been advocated, as has irrigation with urine and salt water. 3. Emetics - to stop digestive organs causing irritation elsewhere in the body, to lower circulation and to relax the skin. Not useful in trachoma. 4. Diaphoretics - useful adjuvants to lower inflammation by increasing perspiration. Diaphoretics should be used as soon as the active inflammation has subdued. 5. Alteratives - to reduce inflammation and to remove effused coagulable lymph. These, particularly mercury, are essential for u se in uveitis and internal ophthalmia. Alteratives are the most useful in severe cases linked with venesection. 6. Tonics such as cinchona were especially useful for scrofulous ophthalmiae. Sulphate and quinine were also used.7. Narcotics - laudanum for pain, applied locally to the temple or forehead, as well as opium and calomel. In addition, belladonna or hyoscyamus can be used to dilate the pupil. They are delivered as an ointment smeared on the eyebrow and are particularly important for internal ophthalmia. 8. Refrigerants - cold water. Although tepid water can also be used; as it evaporates it will also cool by latent heat. Nitre is used as an internal refrigerant and as a diuretic. 9. Astringents including lead acetate and zinc sulphate give uniform bad results; instead, silver nitrate and murias hydrargyri are recommended. 10. Stimulants and escharotics - silver nitrate, but only in solution and never used as an ointment on its own. One could also use vinum opii. 11. Counter irritants - rubefacient liniments, blisters and \"issues\", particularly useful for chronic disease.12. Dietetical - an improvement in the mode of life, including protection from glare, fresh air, rest, quietness, a good diet an d regulated exercise. Table 1.2: Recommendations for the prevention of trachoma, Mackenzie,1830 (29) 1. Prevent exposure to night air; soldiers on guard should cover their heads well and should avoid currents of air. 2.

In a way somewhat reminiscent of Helen of T roy, trachoma was the disease that 'launched a thousand hospitals', and even more careers over the last two centuries. It was the reason that the famous ophthalmic hospitals were established around the world during thelast century. These hospitals include Moorfields in London, the Massachusetts Eye and EarInfirmary in Boston, and even the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital in Melbourne (36). In this chapter, I will examine trachoma in more developed countries by reviewing the impact trachoma has had on the practice of medicine and the evolution of ophthalmology,and observing what was happening as trachoma disappeared from these countries. Institutions formed in response to trachoma Eye hospitals In late 18th century Britain ophthalmology had one of the worst reputations for quackery in the medical profession, but it became the first and possibly the most successful medicalspecialty (37). Before 1800, most eye care was provided by travelling surgeons: 17CHAPTER TWO Trachoma development, institutions and the 20th century Trachoma retreats as civilization advances ANDRE CUENOD , 1901 TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:17 PM Page 16and professionals (38). After the invention of the ophthalmoscope by von Helmholtz (1821-94) in1850, physicians started to examine the eye in evengreater detail and the ophthalmoscope became asmuch a tool of medicine as the stethoscope. In addition to the establishment of eye hospitals and the creation of the specialty of ophthalmology,the number of people blinded from ophthalmia wasalso a spur to the ongoing development of specifichomes and institutions for the blind. Another driverfor this, of course, was the presence of childrenblinded by ophthalmia neonatorum. The high ratesof trachoma in children in orphanages and otherinstitutions led to special trachoma schools beingestablished in and around London in the 1870s and1880s and then elsewhere (30). Attention was givento housing the children in small groups, washingand bathing were performed frequently, and thechildren received regular treatment with coppersulphate or silver nitrate. International organisations One of the first international medical meetings was the International Congress of Ophthalmologyheld in Brussels in 1857. This meeting had twogoals: to discuss military ophthalmia (see Table 2.1)and to discuss the ophthalmoscope that since 1850had completely changed the scope and outlook ofophthalmology (41). At the end of the meetingAlbrecht von Graefe (1828-70) gave the firstpresentation of his revolutionary cure for (angleclosure) glaucoma\u2014peripheral iridectomy. As previously discussed, military ophthalmia was a major political concern and threatened nationalsecurity across Europe. Its spread to the civilianpopulation was of particular concern in Belgium.After the Napoleonic Wars, the Belgium Army had 4000 soldiers blind and 10,000 partiallysighted (15): in their desperation the authorities emptied the barracks of suffering and blinded soldiers, epidemicsof unprecedented proportions spread amongst thecivilian populations, transferring the political andmilitary problem into a social calamity of the first magnitude (41). Although much was discussed at the first International Congress, little could be done abouttrachoma. The International Congress reconvenedfour years later in Paris and with interruptionsduring the World Wars it has continued to meetregularly. The International Congress ofOphthalmology is the oldest international medicalmeeting, and in 1929 its organising body wasformalised with the formation of the InternationalCouncil of Ophthalmology. In that year, theInternational Council participated in the creation oftwo further organisations, the InternationalAssociation for the Prevention of Blindness and theInternational Organization Against Trachoma (41). Led by Charles Nicolle (1860-1936), Nobel Laureate for Medicine in 1928, and Victor Morax(1866-1935), Le Ligue Contre le Trachome wasfounded in Paris in 1923. With the InternationalCouncil, the League helped found the InternationalOrganization Against Trachoma (IOAT) that firstmet in Geneva in 1930 (4). The IOAT continues tomeet annually in association with either theInternational or the European Congresses ofOphthalmology and has provided an importantand ongoing forum under the current leadership ofGabriel Coscas. The League continues to publishLe Revue Internationale du Trachome , a journal started in 1923 by Morax. The International Association for the Prevention of Blindness first met in 1930 and held annualmeetings until the 1950s with a break during theSecond World War. The Association entered into anTRACHOMA DEVELOPMENT , INSTITUTIONS AND THE 20TH CENTURY 19 who palmed themselves upon the public under the name of oculists, operated at fairs and markets and inpublic places, upon raised platforms, something afterthe manner of itinerant showmen of the present day , and whose arrival in any town or village wasannounced by blast of horn (38). The most famous of these was Chevalier John Taylor (1703-72), an English cataract surgeon who\"travelled and stayed in the continent, in a carriagedrawn by four horses, and its panels emblazonedall over with eyes, indicative of his calling\" (38).He was appointed ocularist-in-ordinary to KingGeorge II (39). The explosive appearance of the Egyptian ophthalmia forced a reconsideration by establishedmedicine about the role and importance of eyedisease. The Egyptian ophthalmia was sounexpected, so widespread, so incomprehensibleand so horrid that every medical practitioner hadto know something about it (16). An immediate response in the army was to form separate eyehospitals to take care of soldiers with ophthalmia.This was replicated in civilian life and hospitals,such as the Royal Infirmary for the Diseases of theEye and the London Dispensary for CuringDiseases of the Eye and Ear , were both founded in 1805 in London (see Figure 2.1). The Dispensarybecame the London Eye Infirmary, the LondonOphthalmic Hospital and ultimately MoorfieldsEye Hospital. The military and political imperativeto do something about trachoma helped raise thefunds to establish these hospitals.The introduction of ophthalmia also occurred at a time of growing social and political concernabout the adverse effects of the IndustrialRevolution and the philosophic content ofutilitarianism. Among other things, utilitarianismadvocated that it was the responsibility of thecommunity to enable the visually disabled andblind to undertake productive work (37). Equally,the philosophy of the Enlightenment viewed theprogressive development of humans to a superiororder of being. Those who were deprived of theirsight were also deprived of the ability of reachingfull comprehension and thereby enlightenment.This gave both a moral and philosophical impetusto address ophthalmia and its consequences. Although the Royal Infirmary was established by Jonathan Wathen (later Sir Wathen Waller, 1769-1853) three months before John Saunders(1773-1810) established the London Dispensary,Saunders positioned himself as the father andoriginator of British ophthalmology (37). Saunderswas a controversial figure, but his early death in1810 was followed by years of controversybetween his supporters and advocates and hisdetractors. The new eye hospitals were particularlyvalued and well attended. Following the lead of thehospitals in London, similar eye hospitals rapidlyappeared throughout England, Europe and theNew World. In Britain, 52 Eye or Eye and EarHospitals were established (40). In most instances these hospitals were initially set up to deal withophthalmia or trachoma. W ith new eye hospitals came the need for eye doctors to staff them and this led to furthercontroversy. Prior to the early 1800s, physicianshad shunned ophthalmology and left it to charlatansurgeons and travelling oculists. With the upsurgein the need to care for those with ophthalmia,physicians could no longer neglect eye disease andsuddenly ophthalmology became a mainstreamactivity. There was ongoing controversy for over 50 years as to whether ophthalmologists should beseparate specialists or whether they should begeneralists, with an interest in ophthalmology.There were powerful advocates for both sides.William Wilde (1815-76), an ophthalmologist inDublin, displayed the eloquence that his morefamous son Oscar became renowned for and gavean impassioned justification for separate hospitals18 TRACHOMA Table 2.1: Announcement of the First International Congress of Ophthalmology to be held in Brussels in 1857 (41) Without wanting to terminate any other program, we can say that the issue of military ophthalmia, a disease that for years has affected the many armies of the continent, and also daily claims new victims in the civilian population amongst whom unfortunately it is propagated, will take an important place in our deliberations. An exact statistical analysis of this disease in different countries; a study of the ways by which it is introduced; the examination of the proper measures to halt its progress; the results that could be obtained or expected followi ng their application; and the discussion of the indications of cure and the most satisfactory treatment methods and ways to apply them w ill help to clarify the nature of the disease\u2014imperfect though our knowledge is\u2014and to exercise a beneficial influence on its prophylaxis a nd treatment.

In 1975, the Association was recast as theInternational Agency for the Prevention ofBlindness (IAPB) under the leadership of Sir JohnWilson of the Royal Commonwealth Society of theBlind, with both the International Council ofOphthalmology and the World Blind Union asfounding members. The IAPB has grown to be themajor international organisation co-ordinatingglobal activities for the prevention of blindness (42)and with the WHO, the co-founder of Vision 2020:The Right to Sight Initiative (43). Although the League of Nations was established after the First World War, at that time there was noseparate organisation comparable to the WorldHealth Organization. The international functionsrelating to health were predominantly organisedand co-ordinated by the League, either through itsown health organisation or the International RedCross. In 1929, the League of Nations HealthCommittee endorsed and reprinted the report ontrachoma prepared by the ICO and recommendedthat \"States members should lend [their] full moralsupport\" (44). In 1931 there was concern that trachoma was \"the principal cause of blindness in certainMediterranean districts and in hot countries.\" It had \"considerable significance from aninternational standpoint, because of its worldwidedistribution and because of the restrictive measuresagainst immigration\". An enquiry into \"thelegislative, public health and medical measuresadopted in different countries for the preventionand cure\" of trachoma was established (45). TheInternational Council of Ophthalmology, theInternational Association for the Prevention ofBlindness and the International OrganizationAgainst Trachoma advised both the League ofNations and the International Red Cross aboutvision issues and trachoma. The report on trachomawas published by the League of Nations in 1935 (46). The World Health Organization was established in 1947 and the Association alsoestablished an official relationship with the WHO in 1948. At that time, the WHO and UNICEF established a number of vertical programs including trachoma.A study group in trachoma was established in 1948 (47). The First Expert Advisory Committee on T rachoma met in 1952 and was charged by aresolution of the Third World Health Assembly (48)to \"study the problem of trachoma with a view to submitting practical recommendations\" asto \"the possibility of successfully eradicating it[trachoma] by the application of modern methodsof control\" because \"in a great number of countriestrachoma and a number of other relatedophthalmias constitute an urgent health problem\"(20). This Committee and the subsequent groupsthat met in 1956 (33), 1962 (49) and 1966 (50) consisted of a number of people heavily involved in trachoma research (see Figures 2.2, 2.3). Some have been quite critical that when charged tosubmit \"practical recommendations\" their reportscontained a list of 28 problems for future research (51). Working with UNICEF, the WHO initiated trachoma control programs in 11 countriesincluding Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Taiwan,Burma, India, Oman, Vietnam, Brazil, Libya andSudan, and by 1962 had treated 7.5 million people.Other programs were run in Argentina, Uruguay,Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, the USSR, Turkey,Palestine, Japan, China, Egypt and South Africa(52). The basic strategy was to use tetracyclineointment, provide trichiasis surgery and promoteeducation programs addressing individual andcommunity hygiene. Some of these programs werehighly successful, but others ran into problems thatoften led to frustration and disappointment (53).After 1957 when it became possible to culturechlamydia, a vaccine seemed an attractive pathwayfor a quick solution. In the 1960s and 1970s as the WHO moved from vertical interventionprograms to a more horizontal primary health care approach, specific disease programs, such asthe trachoma programs, gradually fell away. Insome countries such as Thailand this decrease intrachoma activity was linked to both thedevelopment of primary health care capacity and the decrease in trachoma (54). The Alma-Ata Conference in 1978 clearly stated the principles of primary health care andsummarised them in the catch call of \"Health ForAll\" (55). In 1978 this was associated with therecasting of the WHO vision-related activities froma trachoma program to a prevention of blindnessprogram. This had been preceded by World HealthAssembly Resolution in 1975 ( WHA 28.54 (56)) and the selection of prevention of blindness as the20 TRACHOMA Figure 2.3 Members of the Third Expert Advisory Committee on Trachoma, 1962; from left to right: Snyder, unknown photographer, Larmande (foreground), Thygeson, Bietti, unknown, Mann, Carvalho, WHO staff, Scott (foreground), Kamal, WHO secretary (in background), Litricin (courtesy, Chandler Dawson).Figure 2.2 First Expert Advisory Committee on Trachoma outside The League of Nations building, Geneva, 1952; from left to right: Pages, PM Page 20Figure 2.4 World map of trachoma prepared by the International Council of Ophthalmology, 1929 (Wibaut 1929 (58) courtesy, ICO).

At the peak of the Industrial Revolution, peoplewere flooding to the cities and living in appallingconditions in crowded tenements and the workhouses of the urban slums, so well described byHogarth and Dickens. In 1848 Poor Law schoolswere established for the poorest of the poor.Ophthalmia was noted to be a particular problemin children in these schools and often the conditionswere quite terrible. In 1873, 400 children withophthalmia were removed from one Poor Lawschool and treated successfully in a special\"school\" for a year (30). In 1875 EdwardNettleship (1845-1913) reported that activetrachoma ranged from 17% to 66% in the PoorLaw schools, and 9% of children had impairedvision due to corneal scarring and other trachomaschools were established across England (64). In 1888 the Central London District Schoolestablished the \"Hanwell Ophthalmic School\".This school was replaced in 1903 by two newschools, White Oak in Swanlea (see Figure 2.8),Kent and High W ood in Brentwood, Essex. These schools had separate cottages for small groups ofstudents, live-in nursing staff, spray taps in showersand numbered pegs for each child's towel. Thenumber of children admitted progressivelydecreased until in 1938 only 10 children had beenadmitted (64). The High Wood school had been closed in 1918 and the other , now also known as the London Country Council Hospital, finallyclosed in 1944 when there was no more trachomareported (65). The advent and use ofsulphonamides accelerated the treatment ofremaining cases. Similar schools in other Englishcities were closed once trachoma had altogetherdisappeared (66). In the UK, trachoma aggregated in the institutionalised groups; children living in the PoorLaw schools and troops living in crowded andsubstandard barracks. Personal hygiene wascompromised in both crowded settings. However,trachoma was also gradually disappearing fromother areas of Britain, although the documentationis patchy. Trachoma was made a notifiable diseasein Glasgow in 1914 and so better data are availablefor Glasgow than any other city in Britain (64,67).In Glasgow, a specific trachoma clinic wasestablished, all notified patients were treated, andtheir contacts examined and treated, if needed.Until 1933 the number of new cases remained moreor less constant at about 20 cases per year. Thisnumber had fallen to just seven new cases in 1937 (64). The rest of England followed a similar trendTRACHOMA DEVELOPMENT , INSTITUTIONS AND THE 20TH CENTURY 25 theme for World Health Day \"Foresight\" on 7April 1976. The new WHO Prevention of BlindnessProgram (PBL) concentrated on cataract,xerophthalmia and onchocerciasis, in addition totrachoma. Subsequently, it was expanded to includedeafness (PBD). Its mandate has continued tobroaden with the launching of the Vision 2020Initiative in 1999 to include childhood blindness,refractive error and low vision (57). Trachoma in the 20th century World maps Although many had listed countries with trachoma,the first major effort to develop a systematic globalpicture of the distribution of trachoma appears tobe the work of the International Council ofOphthalmology undertaken by F. Wibaut inAmsterdam. He spent two years working on anextensive survey during which he distributed aquestionnaire to representatives of all the existingophthalmic societies (58). This remarkableundertaking was presented at the InternationalCongress in Amsterdam in 1929 (see Figure 2.4).Wibaut summarised the current knowledge oftrachoma that indicated that no races seemed to beimmune and women were affected more severelythan men. Trachoma was a disease of the poor; itwas contagious, secondary infections wereimportant, its incubation period was four to 10days, transmission took place in the family,children aged less than seven years had the highestprevalence and younger children were infected byolder brothers and sisters. The control measuresrecommended were control of the nationalfrontiers, compulsory notification, and theexamination and treatment of schoolchildren andarmy recruits. More trained staff were needed inaffected countries and free treatment wasadvocated for the poor. To eliminate trachoma,general hygiene measures and the improvement ofthe general welfare were needed, as were scientificinvestigation and international collaboration. In 1949, the WHO undertook an initial mapping exercise of trachoma (59) (see Figure 2.5). In 1961 a major world atlas of endemic diseases was published (60). Included amongst thecomprehensive lists of diseases was trachoma. Aworld map was produced and more detailed mapsof several continents were included, with anarrative description of the presence and severity of trachoma and associated conditions (see Figure2.6). In Europe only Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland were free of trachoma, althoughprobably at this time trachoma had disappearedfrom Glasgow leaving the United Kingdom alsotrachoma free. The trachoma clinic run by theGlasgow Royal Infirmary in the docks area ofGlasgow ran until the 1960s (61). Trachoma wasnow recognised to be widespread both in NorthAfrica and sub-Saharan Africa, and throughoutAsia and the Pacific. Trachoma was also a problemin Brazil and the southern cone countries of LatinAmerica, with occasional reports from othercountries in South America; focal areas occurred inCanada, Mexico and the United States. The most recent attempt by the WHO to map the global distribution of trachoma shows thattrachoma has now disappeared from all the \"easy\"countries in Western Europe, North America andmany countries in Asia and the Pacific thatpreviously had a low prevalence (62). By and large,trachoma persists today in those \"hard\" countriesin which it was a major problem 50 years ago (seeFigure 2.7). Polack also prepared maps on the distribution of trichiasis. Country examples Now we will look at some developed countries inwhich blinding endemic trachoma disappeared overthe 20th century. In these countries it is hard to tellwhether the trachoma control activities played animportant role in the elimination of trachoma. Itseems quite likely that the isolation of children intrachoma schools and their improved hygiene wereimportant, but health education in the absence ofmaterial improvement of the environment isunlikely to have made a great or lasting impact.The newly available antibiotics hastened thedisappearance of trachoma in some areas. The onlyreport of a specific attempt to eliminate trachomaby environmental change that I am aware of wasthe slum clearance of the ghetto areas inAmsterdam (63). United KingdomIn the first half of the 18th century , in addition to being a major military problem, there was an24 TRACHOMA Figure 2.8 White Oak Trachoma School or Hospital in Kent for children with trachoma (late 19th century) (\u00a9 Peter Higginbotham, <http://www.workhouses.org.uk>).TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:18 PM Page 24All immigrants were examined with a painful double version of the upper lid, so the upper fornix could be examined as well as the tarsus. Often abutton hook or forceps were used. Even PresidentTheodore Roosevelt was concerned about thechance of cross contamination and after a visit toEllis Island he commented that \"the doctors madethe examinations with dirty hands and with nopretence to clean their instruments\" (72). Suspectimmigrants had the letter T marked in blue chalkon their clothes and were sent to spend five days inthe Contagious Disease Hospital to see if theyrecovered from acute conjunctivitis or whether theyhad trachoma (71). Even though there was frequent argument about whether a particular person had trachoma or not,or whether a case of trachoma was infectious orcured, a final ruling was made and over 95% ofthose with trachoma were deported. To bedeported was a crushing blow and often broke upfamilies and the deportee returned to theirhomeland penniless. A USPHS officer in Baltimorestated \"Deportation is unquestionably a hardship... One had better have smallpox than severetrachoma\" (71). After rigorous examination by aBoard of Inquiry, a fortunate small percentage ofthose with trachoma were permitted to remain inthe Hospital for treatment that took six months onaverage (72). The treatment consisted of resting ina dark room with cold compresses and irrigation ofthe eye three or four times daily with silver nitrateor argyrol solution. More severe cases would betreated with follicular expression and scarificationfollowed by copper sulphate treatment. Grattagewith rubbing of the tarsal conjunctiva with a steelbrush dipped in bichloride of mercury was alsoused. Once \"cured\", immigrants were admitted tothe USA. In 1902 a fine of US$100 was imposed on the shipping companies for every case of trachoma theybrought to the United States (30). This induced theshipping companies to set up their own screeningcentres in Europe to detect trachoma in theirpassengers before they embarked. Centres were setup at country borders and at the major ports ofembarkation in England, Ireland, Germany andalthough it was less well documented. However, the picture was very different in Ireland. In 1903 trachoma cases formed less than1% of eye outpatients seen in seven major hospitalsthroughout Britain, but trachoma still accountedfor 3% of patients seen in Dublin (30). Trachomahad been rife in the Irish workhouses established in1841 with some 15% to 33% of people affected.Severe epidemics of eye disease were reported in1849 and 1850 after the great famine (30). Wilderefers to an epidemic of ophthalmia in Ireland in1701 although it seems unlikely that this wascaused by trachoma (38). In 1937, two to three per1000 schoolchildren in the Republic of Ireland stillhad trachoma (9) and the disease caused 9% ofblindness (66). After the Second World Wartrachoma gradually petered out. United States It is unclear when trachoma first arrived in NorthAmerica and there are no clear indications thattrachoma had been a pre-existing problem in eitherNorth or South America before the arrival ofEuropeans. It has been supposed that trachomawas introduced by European migrants duringcolonial times (68). Others point to the waves ofimmigration from Ireland and Central Europe after1848 until the early 1900s (30,51). Some proposedthat trachoma was brought from Asia by migratingIndian peoples in prehistoric times (4,69). It maywell be that ocular chlamydial infection had beenlongstanding and it was the changed livingconditions that increased the transmissionfrequency that led to blinding trachoma. The Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary which opened in 1850 was modelled on Moorfields (37)and other similar specialist eye or eye and earhospitals were set up across the then United States.The US Army was well aware of the problems ofmilitary ophthalmia. Dr J.S. Hildreth, Surgeon-in-Charge of the US Army Desmarres Eye and EarHospital in Chicago, presented a review of recentcases of gonorrhoeal and purulent ophthalmia atthe inaugural AmericanOphthalmological Society in 1865 (70). Parenthetically , he proposed using pressure dressings for patients with profusely purulentcorneal ulcers, a suggestion some of his audiencevehemently disagreed with. Epidemics of purulent ophthalmia were observed in the USA from 1825, but whether these wererelated to trachoma or other causes of acuteconjunctivitis is unknown (15). Boldt also quotesthat 40% of the wards of a workhouse in NewYork had trachoma in the 1890s, although theprevalence of trachoma in Southern California wasless than 1%. In 1897 Surgeon General Walter Wyman (1848- 1911) of the US Marine Hospital Service declaredtrachoma to be a \"dangerous contagious disease\"and instructed his medical officers to examine allimmigrants (30). Would-be immigrants or alienswere also excluded if they were imbeciles,epileptics, insane, paupers, or if they hadtuberculosis or other loathsome or dangerouscontagious diseases that included trachoma,cholera, typhus, ringworm or other fungalinfections (71). All those suspected to have red,watery or sore eyes were to be examined. Trachoma came to be the central character \"on the national stage of infectious disease andimmigration\" (72). Newly arrived immigrantspersonified the threat of trachoma to thecommunity and local outbreaks of trachoma wereblamed on immigrant children and their families.The aetiology and epidemiology of trachoma werepoorly understood. However, it was clearlyrecognised by the public, professionals andpoliticians alike that trachoma was extremelycontagious, and could be spread through touch anddirect contact, and was particularly prevalent inareas where the weather and personal hygiene werepoor. The presence of trachoma was used as apolitical weapon to stigmatise immigrant groups,especially eastern European Jews and migrantsfrom the eastern Mediterranean and Asia (72).Trachoma surveillance of immigrants also becamethe major activity of the United States PublicHealth Service (USPHS). It \"protected the nationagainst imported germs\" and 80% of its resourceswere directed to the medical examination ofimmigrants (see Figure 2.9). Between 1897 and1924, some Trachoma of 44% of those with infectious diseaseand 9% for those debarred for all reasons (seeFigure 2.10). 26 TRACHOMA LEFT Figure 2.9 Trachoma poster, fund for the relief of Jewish victims of the war in eastern Europe and the Federation ofUkrainian Jews, London, 1923 (Markel 2000(72), from the Archives of the YIVO Institutefor Jewish Research, New York).

A numberof surveys followed that defined the \"trachomabelt\" in the USA (68) (see Figure 2.11). Trachoma was widespread, from the Allegheny Mountains and rural Appalachia through toKansas and Oklahoma. The highest prevalence of trachoma reported amongst Americans (exclusiveof Indians) was 13% in Kentucky , but the average rates of trachoma for Indian populations was 23%.Trachoma was a particular problem in the southwest and mid west, and a prevalence of 92% wasreported in Indian boarding school students inOklahoma in 1912 (76). Trachoma also occurred on the east and west coasts. This was attributed toimmigrants from Europe and Asia living insubstandard and crowded housing after theirarrival. In total, 35 of the 48 states in the USAreported cases of trachoma (68). Many drew attention to the fact that Afro- Americans had much lower rates of trachoma thanthe Europeans amongst whom they lived andworked (30,68,69,71). At that time trachoma wasalso believed to be rare in sub-Saharan Africa,although this misconception was later corrected. Itwas noted that Africans in the West Indies had highrates of trachoma but this apparent conundrumremained unexplained at that time (30). Allen and Semba have given a very good overview of the efforts to control trachoma in theUSA (74). Their report includes a photograph of\"the blind leading the blind\" as a result oftrachoma (see Figure 2.12) reminiscent of thephotographs of onchocerciasis in Africa, and otherphotographs included in Stucky's paper (75).Briefly, the control measures aimed to treat everyexisting case and to prevent new cases fromdeveloping by means of health education.Education campaigns were used to teach peopleabout the spread of disease and to encourage theimprovement of personal hygiene. In 1913 the USCongress made a specific allocation of US$25,000to combat trachoma (74). The importance of family transmission was well recognised, as was the link to poor personalhygiene (75,76); the use of a common towel was \"an almost certain invitation to disease\" and\"improvement in economic status with itsconcomitant improvement in sanitation andhousing\" was seen as the key to elimination ofdisease (6). Living conditions were remarkablysimilar to those often reported from less developedareas of Africa today . People lived in \"the rudest kind of hut ... No windows, a lean-to chimney, alittle stove in that room and in this room live theparents and anywhere from seven to 13 children ...Everyone wiped on the one towel\" (77). In Ohio,another area with a high prevalence of trachoma,most houses had outdoor privies, no running waterand there was no garbage collection. Boarding homes were considered to particularly facilitate the spread of trachoma, where peoplewould often sleep two to a bed, with eight to 10workers sharing a single room, sometimes sharingbeds between night and day shifts (74). Trachomawas found to be a particular problem in New York,especially in the schools and in the Lower East side.This has been linked to migration especially fromIreland and later central Europe (30), although itseems likely that the appalling crowding andunsanitary conditions in the tenements were alsovery important factors. A visit to the TenementMuseum in New York will confirm this view. Up tohalf the children in orphanages in New York hadtrachoma in the late 1800s (78). As in London,special trachoma schools were established in NewYork in 1912 and these also emphasised hygieneand daily washing. TRACHOMA DEVELOPMENT , INSTITUTIONS AND THE 20TH CENTURY 29 Italy. Some centres such as that in Naples wasactually staffed by USPHS officers. One centre,Atlantic Park in Southampton, was still inoperation in the 1930s (73). An increase in thenumber of people with trachoma was reported inLondon reflecting those who had been rejected bythe shipping companies (30). It was common tohave 2% to 5% of prospective immigrantsrejected\u201485% because of trachoma (72). In 1901a similar problem occurred in Montreal after theUS authorities had started to examine all thoseentering the USA from Canada (30). In 1902 theCanadian Government enacted legislation toprohibit entry into Canada to those with trachoma. By 1905 the US Congress had mandated that every single immigrant to the United States had tobe examined for trachoma and US immigrationservice facilities, such as Ellis Island in New York,Locus Point in Baltimore, and in Boston,Philadelphia and elsewhere became centres forscreening (74). The examination on arrival mightbe more cursory for First and Second Classpassengers, but it was rigorous for those Third andFourth Class \"Steerage\" passengers (72). Allpassengers would have already been screened onceor twice before they boarded the ship. From 1905,a million immigrants arrived in the USA each yearuntil the First World War when the numbershalved. It is interesting to reflect on the amount oftime, money and effort that was spent on thesetrachoma activities. Little attention was given to endemic trachoma within the USA until 1911, when Dr J.A. Stucky ofLexington, Kentucky reported the frequentoccurrence of trachoma in eastern Kentucky (75). The Committee on the Prevention of Blindness inthe American Medical Association, pressed the USPublic Health and Marine Hospital Service to ABOVE Figure 2.11 The \"trachoma belt\" in the United States in 1940 (Gradle HS.

TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:18 PM Page 28The US Public Health Service established trachoma hospitals in regions such as Kentucky and Tennessee (51) (see Figure 2.13). In other areaslike Illinois and Arkansas, a system of permanentfield clinics and dispensaries was created. Fieldnurses held outreach clinics three times a week andprovided health education about trachoma and theneed to use separate towels. They also gave talks atschools and distributed pamphlets. Cases of trachoma were treated with copper sulphate and silver nitrate until sulphonamidesbecame available in the late 1930s (6). In 1939 there were some 35,000 cases of trachoma in non-Indian Americans (two-thirds had active trachoma)and 10% were blind (68). Another 25,000 American Indians had trachoma. Siniscal recounts how in Missouri, trachoma caused 25% of theblindness in the 1930s, but by 1955 this haddropped to only 10% (6). As part of the New Deal in 1935, the American Government turned over trachoma control to thestates to administer (74). By the early 1950s trachoma had ceased to be a major problem.Trachoma control activities continued in Illinois forfive years after the last active case was detected in1949 and ceased in Oklahoma and Arkansas in1955 (6). The trachoma program in Kentuckyended in 1953 when no more cases could be foundand all the surgery had been completed (51). Theprogram continued in Missouri in 1953 when only14 cases were detected (6). In the 1960s the rates ofsurgery for nasolacrimal duct obstruction anddacrycystitis were supposedly much higher in St.Louis (in the middle of the old trachoma belt) thanin other parts of the USA. Trachoma continued to be a problem in the Indian populations in Arizona and New Mexicoand the Indian health service re-establishedtrachoma control units in 1965 (79). Intenseinterventions, including the community-widedistribution of sulphonamides, with improvingsocio-environmental conditions led to a decline inthe occurrence of trachoma (80) (see Figures 2.14,2.15). However, trachoma was still reportedoccasionally in Indian communities until the 1980s(81) (see Figure 2.16). It is interesting to reflect on how much time and effort was spent on the eradication of trachoma inthe USA when, in reality, so few people wereaffected. A similar observation can be made for theUK. This gives us an important benchmark tocompare monitoring and evaluation targets in thecurrent endemic areas. There was no argument thata prevalence of less than 5% or 10% was notimportant and treatment activities could be juststopped; in these developed countries \"every lastcase\" had to be eliminated. FranceT rachoma is thought to have existed in southern France from Roman times and was further spreadby pilgrims in the Middle Ages (24). Although theFrench Army was severely affected by trachomaduring the Egyptian campaign in the early 1800s,the disease did not become a major problem in thecivilian population in France, although it was quitewidespread. In 1900 the prevalence of trachoma inParis was 1.7% but most trachoma was evidentalong the Mediterranean coast (15). The rates ofoccurrence in Marseilles in 1929 were between 2%to 5% (58) and much of this occurred in immigrantworkers from French North Africa. Another focusof infection was the industrial area around Lillewhich also had a prevalence of trachoma between2% to 4%. Here it was related to migrant workersfrom North Africa and Poland. It is interesting tonote that in 1884 the rates of trachoma reportedfor Lille were 50% (82). Comprehensive recommendations for the management of trachoma were developed andwidely circulated in France (24,73). AlthoughFrench ophthalmologists were not confronted withhigh levels of trachoma at home, they undertookoutstanding work in their colonies, particularly inNorth and West Africa. The work of Nicolle,Morax, Andre Cuenod (d. 1954) and Roger Nataf(1901-86) is particularly noteworthy. Japan It is unclear when trachoma was first recognised in Japan but in the 14th century it was known as\"borome\" (wretched eye) (54). Some havecommented that it was not documented before themiddle of the 1800s when Japan reopened tradewith the West (9). In 1897, just after the SinoJapanese War (1894-5), the prevalence of trachomain Tokyo is reported to be 14% and between 25%to 75% of eye patients had trachoma (15) asTRACHOMA DEVELOPMENT , INSTITUTIONS AND THE 20TH CENTURY 31 Figure 2.14 Dr WP Whitted examines eyes of trachoma patient, Trachoma School, Fort Defiance, Arizona 1941 (from collections of the National Archives and RecordsAdministration).

TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:18 PM Page 30This continued as a vertical program until 1976, by which time trachoma rates were falling, and Thailand had started to develop a primary healthcare model. The trachoma program was considereda prototype for primary health care and led directlyto the development of a primary eye care system(54). The screening of all schoolchildren fortrachoma continued as did individual treatment. When the program started, active trachoma rates were of the order of 20% with 66% of thepopulation showing some signs of trachoma (54).There was not a clear gender difference andtrachoma was responsible for 9% of blindness.During this period there was considerablecommunity development and by 1984, theprevalence of trachoma in children had fallen to0.6%, and trichiasis rates were 0.2%. Based onthese data, the Ministry of Public Health ceasedtrachoma services in primary and secondaryschools and replaced this with a refraction servicefor schoolchildren. Until that time, allschoolchildren were still routinely examined fortrachoma. The work in Thailand is a wonderfulexample of a successfully planned verticalintervention campaign against trachoma thatbecame integrated into the ongoing primary healthcare system during its consolidation phase. There is neither enough time nor is it my intention to document trachoma trends in everycountry. I have briefly considered a few countries to give an outline of the way trachoma has beenmanaged and disappeared. The unusual situation in Australia will be dealt with in more detail inchapter ten.infected soldiers returned home from Korea andManchuria (54) (see Figure 2.17). In 1919 the Trachoma Control Law called for the entire population to be periodically examined andbetween 7 million to 10 million people wereexamined each year (9). The Japan TrachomaSociety was established to co-ordinate this activityand provide training and guidelines. All men wereexamined at the age of 19 and again, one year later,when they were called up for military service. Allschoolchildren, teachers and those with closeoccupational contact with others such as nurses andhairdressers were examined every year. Any personwho was diagnosed with trachoma was treated (atno charge for the poor) and they and their relativeswere given proper hygiene instruction (4). In 1929the population prevalence was reported to be 13%(58). Trachoma Prevention Day was later markedwith educational films and lectures and eventuallybecame the Japanese World Sight Day and is stillcelebrated on 10 October (\"10/10\"). With the rapid social change and economic development in Japan, the number of people withtrachoma had fallen dramatically in the 1950s,even given the disruption of activities during theSecond World War (1939-45) (83) (see Figure2.18). The amount of blindness due to trachomahad fallen from about 15% of blindness in the1930s to 0.1% in 1974 (84). In 1983 the TrachomaControl Law was repealed and the Japan TrachomaSociety became the Japanese Society for thePrevention of Blindness. USSR At the start of the 20th century Russia had thehighest rates of trachoma of any European country(15). Trachoma had been thought to exist in theCrimea \"from time immemorial\". In the early 20thcentury trachoma was thought to be presentthroughout the Soviet Union (59) and in the 1920s,the reported rates of trachoma ranged from 6% inRussia to 15% to 20% in the Central AsianRepublics, with some areas as high as 86% (58).The first Ophthalmological Congress of the SovietUnion (1926) established guidelines for newdispensaries and \"flying columns\" to be created tocontrol trachoma. Enabling legislation was passedin 1927 that authorised health authorities toexamine anyone thought to be at risk of havingtrachoma and to compel infected persons toundergo treatment (59). The specific trachomaintervention program was enhanced in 1938 whentrachoma was made a notifiable disease. Theprogram continued through and after the SecondWorld War (52). Trachoma control was againincluded in Stalin's fourth five-year plan in 1946. The USSR campaign was designed on the model developed in Egypt by MacCallan and hiscolleagues. It involved the establishment ofophthalmic hospitals, some stationary and somemobile, and numerous local and regional schooldispensaries (52). The ophthalmologic co-ordinating centres provided eye care services butalso provided training, liaison and co-ordinationfor those working in regional and village programs.Regional ophthalmologists co-ordinated fieldactivities that were predominantly carried out byvillage physicians and trained assistants. Regionalhealth education campaigns were conducted withthe emphasis on the eradication of trachoma as asocietal disease of the collective. Good progress was made with general health education campaigns, case identification, treatmentof cases with copper sulphate and silver nitrate(and later the sulfa drugs), and socioeconomicdevelopment. The advent of tetracycline in the1950s led to a speedy elimination of trachoma inmost areas and similar programs were initiated inYugoslavia, Hungary, Poland and Rumania. Thailand Trachoma has been a major problem in Thailand,particularly in the central and north-east areas.These areas are extremely dry and dusty with poorwater supply and are very similar to adjacent areasin Myanmar and Cambodia. Trachoma was knownas \"Ta Nam\" (watery eye) (54). A verticaltrachoma control program was started with WHOsupport in 1959. Having started as a pilot projectin one province, Korat, it extended in 1967 tocover nine provinces in the north-east region.Household surveys were performed with door todoor registration and examination of all familymembers. Health education was promoted throughcommunity and school meetings and specifictraining of medical and non-medical supportpersonnel was provided. Individual topicaltetracycline treatment was administered bycommunity volunteers and trichiasis surgery wasperformed at subcentres by mobile teams. 32 TRACHOMA LEFT Figure 2.17 Trachoma prevalence in Japanese military conscripts (Konyama 2004-2005 (54), reproduced with permission from Wolters Kluwer,France).

Active trachoma is characterised by an inflammatory response associated withthe variable presence of demonstrable infection. The inflammation can vary in intensitybut when severe, it leads to tarsal scarring and corneal pannus. Cicatricial trachoma ismarked by in the lid with tarsal scarring and trichiasis. In this case,inflammation is variable and chlamydia are infrequently seen. In an endemic area, a well-established case of active trachoma can be very easy to diagnose. I first started trachoma fieldwork in Port Augusta, South Australia, in 1976. Onour second day in the field, young schoolboys whom we examined the day before, wereeverting each other's lids and examining for trachoma. The difficulty with diagnosing activeinflammatory trachoma in an endemic area is not so much in making the diagnosis inestablished cases, but the differentiation of borderline cases from normal, or sometimes,distinguishing cases of severe inflammatory trachoma from acute bacterial or viralconjunctivitis. The detection of trichiasis only requires careful examination. However, the diagnosis of trachoma can be much more difficult to make in areas of low endemicity,although severe tarsal scarring, corneal pannus with Herbert's pits and almost pathonomonic any setting.TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:18 PM Page 34\"granular conjunctivitis\" and the were be distinguished from papillae. Bendz in Copenhagen undertook histologic studies and described the granulations as \"collections oflymphoid cells\" (85). He identified them as follicles pointed out the similaritiesbetween the conjunctival follicles and Peyer' s patches concretions that may be seen ascalcified inclusions or grains of sand in scarredlids. By the end of the 19th century, the term\"follicle\" was widely used. Boldt gives an interesting description of the progressive change in the definition in trachomathat was used by the Prussian Army in the 19thcentury (15). These changes reflected what was happening elsewhere in Europe. From 1815, allsoldiers with contagious ophthalmia were senthome after all pain, inflammation and dischargehad \"passed off\". Their commanding officer wasfirst to notify the district council of a soldier' s discharge. Contagious ophthalmia was not definedfurther, although any recruits with severecontagious ophthalmia were rejected. Men withmild cases of ophthalmia were still recruited. As Boldt states \"an extraordinary difference of opinion often arose over the passing of recruitsbetween the army surgeons and the medicalofficers\" (15). In one instance, 328 possible recruits were initially rejected because oftrachoma, but none was thought to have trachomawhen they were re-examined. Boldt points out theclinical difficulty of making a precise diagnosis, the occurrence of doubtful cases, the seriousness of the consequences of missing a case of purulentconjunctivitis that could spark an epidemic, andthe possibility that potential recruits mightaggravate \"any slight conjunctivitis\" todeliberately avoid conscription. W e still encounter similar difficulties today, especially in lowprevalence areas. In 1863, the Prussian Army further defined infectious diseases of the eye to recognise thefollowing conditions: primary granulations,granular conjunctivitis, acute blennorrhoea, chronic blennorrhoea and secondary granulations. By 1880 a large controversy raged between the so-called \"Unitarians\" and the \"Dualists\" (15). Bythis stage what we now know today as inclusionconjunctivitis (primary granulations, or mildfollicular conjunctivitis) was seen to have many similarities with trachoma, but it was self-limitingand did not lead to the chronic blinding sequelaeCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS 37 The key sign in active trachoma is the \"trachoma follicle\", that is, lymphoid follicles orgerminal in the superior tarsal conjunctiva.However, the intense diffuse inflammatoryinfiltrate that surrounds the follicles causes tissuedamage that leads to scarring and the subsequentlid changes, trichiasis and eventual blindness.Although the presence of superior tarsal follicles isused as the primary diagnostic feature in thegrading of active trachoma, it is the intenseinflammation shown by conjunctival inflammatorythickening and papillae that reflects the criticalprocess in the pathogenesis. In this regard, whenwe grade trachoma, we may have been\"hoodwinked\" by the follicles. The ancient classification of trachoma Although trachoma was well recognised in ancientEgypt and China, we have no written descriptionsof its clinical evolution. The ancient Greeks andRomans were familiar with trachoma and knew itwell, both as a purulent ophthalmia (or lippitudo)and as a cause of the subsequent trichiasis(trichosis). All the surviving ancient medical textsthat deal with ocular disease include descriptionsof trachoma and its treatment (10). Hippocrates first recorded the terms \"ophthalmia\" and \"trichosis\" (in 400 BC) and compared the changes of the thickened lid to a cutopen black fig\u2014both thickened, red and studdedwith white dots. The Greco-Roman encyclopaedistsurgeon Celsus described the roughness of the lidin disease \"rough eye lids\" (aspritudo oculorum palpebrarum) or aspritudofor short. This seems to refer to the changes ofactive trachoma, but may also have been used torefer to the roughened surface of the tarsus causedby scarring when viewed by the naked eye. TheGreek translation of aspritudo is \"trachoma\", aterm first used by Discorides (~60 AD). A book called De Oculis by Claudius Galerus appeared long after Galen's death in 201 AD. Although attributed to Galen, this book is thoughtto be a collection of Greek writings put together byan Arabian author (10). Trachoma is described ashaving four stages. These stages were \"itchy eye\",\"rough\", \"scarred\" and \"trichiasis\". These fourstages were more fully described by Aetius ofAmida (540 AD) and subsequently repeated by many authors. This grading seems to have beenwidely used around the Mediterranean and wasstill used in the Middle Ages (21). The Arabianophthalmologist Ali Ibn Isa of Baghdad (~1000 AD) used the term \"sarab\" (scabies) in the eye in his classic textbook and this term became widelyused. This term was also taken up by medievalEurope as the Arabic texts were first translated toLatin and then from Latin into the vernacular (18). The 19th century In the excitement generated by severe purulentconjunctivitis spreading in epidemic proportionsand the frequent corneal ulceration thatcharacterised Ophthalmia aegypticus in the early 1800s, the ancient classification was eitherforgotten or swamped. Vetch was familiar with the ancient texts and treatments and quoted them(16). However, most military surgeons who accompanied the French and British forces inEgypt were not trained in ophthalmology andwould not be versed in such matters. Their job wasto treat the wounded and sick. As we have seen,most ophthalmologists, such as Mackenzie in his landmark textbook, concentrated almost entirely on the acute manifestations of the ophthalmia (29). They classified the type and severity of theconjunctival discharge, almost infinite variations in ocular pain to which great diagnosticimportance was attached, and the degree ofcorneal involvement, although conjunctivalscarring and trichiasis were clearly recognised aslate complications. Mackenzie based much of his material on the work of the British military physician John Vetch, who had written a very interesting monographdetailing his experiences with the Egyptianophthalmia (16). In his introduction Vetch does refer to the ancient writers, Hippocrates, Aetiusand Paullus of Aegetius, as well as Celsus He differentiated the ophthalmia as the Ancients\"from ocular gonorrhea the importanceof conjunctival \"granulations\" under the upper lid(see Figure 3.1). This led to the use of the term36 TRACHOMA Figure 3.1 Granular conjunctivitis. \"Represents a granular state of theconjunctiva of the upper lid,with the first effects by thepressure upon the globe; theinflammation conjunctiva,and the haze of the upper partof the surface of the cornea\"(Morgan J. Lectures onDiseases of the Eye. 2nd ed.London: Samuel Highley,1848). TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:18 PM Page 36This then progressed to Chronic Trachoma of which there were three further stages. The firstchronic stage (\"Stage 2\") was characterised by anincrease in of follicles, themarked development of papillae nextstage featured cicatrization, as thelid became pale and was no longer swollen, withthe ultimate development of entropion andtrichiasis. In untreated cases, up to two-thirds ofthose infected would develop trichiasis or somecorneal changes, and 5% would developdacryocystitis. Boldt was convinced that the development of conjunctival and tarsal scarring was essential states No scarring, cure\" (15).Although he also observes \"The greater and deeperthe diffuse infiltration and follicle formation, themore marked the subsequent scarring\" (15). However, despite having described the stages proposed by Raehlmann and the histologic studiesthat underpinned it, Boldt, a military surgeon withan eye on the military consequences (15),recommended grading or grouping of trachomacases into four classes following the plan ofHirschberg (87) and Greeff (88): A Suspicious cases.B Mild cases with moderate hypertrophy of the conjunctiva and a few follicles in the tarsus. C Moderately severe cases, showing many follicles in both lids and marked lid swelling. D Severe cases which already showed cicatricial sequelae such as tarsal scarring, pannus, entropion and trichiasis. The presence of distinct and infiltration of the tarsal conjunctiva or papillary hypertrophywas regarded as essential for the diagnosis oftrachoma (classes B and C). MacCallan Classification, 1908 In 1903 a British merchant banker who hadfinanced the building of the original Aswan Dam,Sir Ernest Cassel (1852-1921), donated \u00a340,000to the Egyptian Government to establish aprogram to address eye disease in Egypt and totrain local doctors in ophthalmology (30). ArthurFerguson MacCallan (1873-1955), anophthalmologist from Moorfields, went to Egyptto start this program (see Figure 3.3). Thisprogram used both mobile and permanent eyehospitals and soon started school treatmentCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS 39 of trachoma. The Unitarians believed that bothinclusion conjunctivitis and trachoma weremanifestations of the same disease. The Dualistsbelieved they were two quite separate diseases. TheUnitarians tended to work in endemic areaswhereas the Dualists tended to work in areaswhere endemic trachoma had become rare (15).This controversy continued to involve intensedebate throughout the 1930s and 1950s. It waspartially resolved when chlamydia was cultured in1957, but this issue also underlies the currentdiscussion of reinfection and persistent infection. The presence of follicles on the upper tarsus was used as the key determining sign betweentrachoma and inclusion conjunctivitis or follicularconjunctivitis. In 1880, the Prussian Army issuednew regulations. The Dualists had prevailed andrecruits could be accepted with acute or chronicconjunctivitis with only moderate discharge, slightcases of follicular conjunctivitis with a normalupper tarsal (follicles but without appreciableconjunctival oedema or thickening). Presumablynew soldiers were hard to find after the Franco-Prussian Wars and so pragmatically the criteriawere weakened. During this time, Eduard Raehlmann (1843- 1917) had reported his extensive histologicalstudies showing the similarity of inclusionconjunctivitis, primary granulations and trachoma(86) (see Figure 3.2). This lent further weight tothe Unitarians who prevailed when the PrussianArmy regulations were rewritten by von Hippel in1893. Now recruits with any follicles in the upperlid were excluded (15). The concurrentdevelopment of bacteriology and the ability topositively identify gonococcus greatly clarified theconfusion between the blennorrhoeic, catarrhaland granular forms of conjunctivitis that hadpreviously confused the diagnosis of acute oractive trachoma from other forms of acuteophthalmia. On the basis of his histological studies, Raehlmann also described trachoma as having fourstages (86). The first, Acute Trachoma, hadfollicles present as part of an acute conjunctivitis. 38 TRACHOMA Figure 3.2 Raehlmann's drawings of follicles.

After the end of the First World War, the Memorial Ophthalmic Laboratory was built atGiza with support from the Imperial War GravesCommission (4) (see Figure 3.4). In 1908 MacCallan published his classification system that was to become the standardclassification worldwide (89). He subsequentlyacknowledged this as a natural development of the system previously described by Raehlmann(25). By 1913, his apparently simple four-stageclassification actually contained eight stages or sub-stages (see Table 3.1 and Figure 3.5). MacCallanoptimistically states \"with a comparatively smallamount of experience, most cases of trachoma canbe placed easily in one or other of these stages.Some cases are borderline between two stages andmay be so indicated, eg trachoma I to to III\". He further states that\"unmixed trachoma is always a chronic disease. It frequently commences with acute manifestationsor exhibits acute exacerbations, but these are theresult of superadded infections with well-knownbacteria\" (25). The MacCallan Classification was soon taken up by others. Ernest Fuchs (1851-1930) in Viennaand Edmund Landolt (1846-1926) in Paris in Egypt before 1914, and theytook his grading back to their clinics where theyadopted and promoted it, as did Cuenod andNataf in Tunis and other leaders in the field. Itbecame the standard classification for English andFrench ophthalmologists (73). In fact, theMacCallan Classification was the world standardfor over 60 years. However, the MacCallan Classification had many shortcomings. In 1967 Ida Mann (1893-1983), a distinguished British ophthalmologistwho after migrating to Australia did extraordinarywork in outback Australia and the Pacific Islands,wrote \"We now realise that the old concept of aclearcut clinical entity running a known coursedivisible into stages through which each casepasses, is largely untenable\"(90). Again in 1975,Barrie Jones (1921-), a New Zealander who wasthe first Professor of Ophthalmology in London,suggested that the MacCallan stages of trachoma: have come to offer a barrier to elucidation for they tacitly suggest that the disease runs a single cycle andon their own they give no quantification of theintensity of active inflammation, nor a sufficientdescription of the scarring that leads to the evolutionof trichiasis and entropion. The most urgentrequirement is to appreciate that the disease isfrequently a multi-cyclic infection (91). The World Health Organization (WHO) was established after the Second World War. Trachomawas one of the high priorities that it inherited fromthe preceding League of Nations. The first WHOExpert Committee on Trachoma met in 1952 (20).They adopted the MacCallan Classification as thestandard for use in administrative documents andfor collecting national level data, but as we will seebelow, they also created a much more detailed andprecise grading scheme for \"clinical and scientific\"use. They developed a complicated coding systemto further specify the presence of follicles, papillaeand scars and to grade their severity (see Table3.2). They also advocated recording the presenceand extent of corneal vessels and corneal infiltrate. In 1962, the third Expert Committee reviewed the grading system and proposed further changes(49). They suggested the term \"TrD\" (trachomadubium) be used for clinical signs suggestive of anearly conjunctival response to invasion by atrachoma virus. They suggested another newcategory of \"ND\" (not determined) to indicatedoubt as to whether more advanced lesions were Figure 3.5 MacCallan Classification of Trachoma (Wilson 1932 (32). This figure was published in the American Journal of Ophthalmology, Vol 15, Wilson RP, Ophthalmia (89) Trachoma I, seen typically soon after infection has occurred.

A further classification of \"PrTr\" (or proto-trachoma or pre-folliculartrachoma) was also added. These changes addedfurther complexity to the MacCallanClassification, but did not address the aboveshortcomings by Mann and Jones. Workers in the field also made their own adjustments to the MacCallan Classification. Forexample, Roger Nichols and the Harvard groupworking in Saudi Arabia graded individuals as beingnormal, or having hyperemia, muco-purulentconjunctivitis, or stages II, III or IV of trachoma(92). However, the MacCallan system was wellembedded and continued to be described intextbooks and in WHO publications until 1981. It was still in use in reports appearing as recently as 1997 (93). World Health Organization trachoma classifications, 1952-62 The World Health Organization Expert Committees on Trachoma brought togetherexperts on trachoma from all parts of the world.Membership of the four Expert Committees heldbetween 1952 and 1966 changed somewhat andeach member brought their own particularexperience and hobby horses. The first Committee(1952) reinforced the status quo and theMacCallan Classification, but as mentioned theysuggested a new level of complexity and sub-specification for researchers (Table 3.2) (20). The second Committee (1956) was more preoccupied with setting a research agenda fortrachoma (33). They established the criteria neededto make a clinical diagnosis and insisted that atleast two of the following signs be present: follicles(conjunctival or limbal), epithelial keratitis in the42 TRACHOMA Figure See legend oppositeFigure 3.6 Clinical stages of trachoma (Cuenod & Nataf 1934 (97), reproduced with permission from Elsevier Masson).

Early trachoma in eight-year-old child: to the naked eye, the conjunctiva presents some \"white-yellowish\" points composi ng \"granulations\" that at this initial stage only project a little.Fig 2. A small portion of the tarsal conjunctiva of the upper eyelid. The vascular system of the tarsal conjunctiva is very bl urred, as though covered by a veil. The follicles appear as \"half-blisters\", lightly covered and opalescent, with vessels between and ar ound them that seem to come from normal vessels. In addition, one can see on the surface of the conjunctiva the flowering bouquets of the neo-vascularisation raising perpendicular to the conjunctival plane. The upper border of the tarsus and the superior tarsalconjunctiva in addition to follicles also show darker papillae with poorly defined contours. They create a mosaic of papillae around the follicles. In general, the follicles seem to be situated at the bifurcation of the normal tarsal vessels.Fig 3. An early trachoma follicle: this a defined, raised, half-blistered bulge; opalescent but ne arly translucent through which one can discern a network of normal conjunctival vessels. This hemispherical bulge has imprecisecontours and is surrounded by vascular plumes that rise from the normal network of vessels. Some of these vascular plumes givebranches that cross the surface of the follicle and some may penetrate them. The vascularisation of the follicle is essentially at theperiphery and on the surface, the trunks of the small capillaries wind over the surface, and only the terminal branches penetra te the follicles. This is the opposite of what is seen in papillae that usually have one, or sometimes two, central vascular trunks w ith terminal branches that expand on the surface.Table 3.2: WHO Expert Committee on Trachoma First Report 1952 (20) Note: in administrative documents, only the indications of the basic stages of trachoma should be used.ExamplesTr I = trachoma at onsetTr II established trachoma florid forms)Tr = cicatrizing trachomaTr IV = cicatrized or healed trachomaNote: for documents requiring more precise clinical and scientific recording of observations, additional symbols should be used.(1) Stages of trachoma (Tr I, Tr II, Tr III, Tr IV)(2) Presence of an associated disease, mixed form (M)(3) Indication of verification of cure by a recognised test (v)(4) Presence of scars (C)*(5) Presence of follicles or of prefollicular lesions (prF)(6) Presence of papillae (P)*(7) Presence of corneal vessels (V)**(8) Infiltration of the cornea (i)** * to be graded by severity of the lesions ** to be graded in mmTRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:18 PM Page 42Figure 3.6 Continued- see opposite Trachomatous pannus - see above (a) Trachomatous pannus in a developing stage: biomicroscopy clearly confirms pannusmerits the name of a \"V asculo-granular Veil\". The superior third of the cornea shows an extensive infiltration. Instead of stopping at the limbus, the vessels of the bulbar conjunctiva continue directly towardsthe centre of the cornea, perpendicular to the limbus.These vessels stop at the limit of infiltration and anastomose, making vascular arcades and loops. Studies ofearly pannus indicate that the infiltration precedes this vascularisation of the infiltrated zone and that focalinflammatory condensations are usually situated at the points of vascular branching.These focal collections more or less crimp the vessels; they are lightly covered by the corneal epithelium andconstitute true follicles, some are vascularised and clearly resemble the trachoma follicles of the conjunctiva.Beyond the zone of infiltration and in the healthy cornea there are more or less isolated focal points ofinfiltration that seem to precede the infiltration and the vascularised pannus.(b) Trachomatous pannus and limbal changes: thinned pannus; the \"veil\" has regressed.The infiltration is gray and transparent in the upper third of the cornea; with very fine vascularisation. Allalong the superior arc of the limbus is a veritable chain of small excavations of varied shape and size, with atransparent base that more or less crimps the fine vessels. These are the \"limbal ocelles\" of Bonnet orHerbert's Pits that are the remainder of the follicles that occur in trachomatous pannus and particularly thelimbal follicles (the Sago limbus of Bonnet) that have now healed and now are empty. Trachoma scarring - see page opposite Fig 1. Early trachoma scarring (Tr III): the star-like scars are shown as if they mark the position of old follicles.

The slit lamp was invented in 1911 by the Swedish ophthalmologist Alvar Gullstrand (1862-1930, Nobel Laureate in 1911) but was notwidely used until the 1920s. Prior to this, loupes ofup to 10 times magnification had been used tostudy and describe the corneal changes. The slitlamp facilitated these studies and several detailedstudies of the conjunctival and corneal changesappeared (96,97) (see Figure 3.6). This led to anincreased awareness of corneal neovascularisationand pannus. In milder cases pannus and cornealchanges may only be seen by slit lampexaminations. However in 1904 Major H.Herbert, a British ophthalmologist serving inBombay had described his characteristic limbal pits (98). Subsequently pannus and Herbert's pitsbecame prerequisites for the diagnosis of trachoma(see Figure 3.7). Detailed studies and drawings ofthe corneal vascular changes had been made byRowland Wilson (1896-1981) in Egypt in 1932(96). Wilson, a New Zealander, had succeededMacCallan as the Director of the Giza Laboratoryfrom 1926 to 1945. During the \"aetiology\" wars fought in the 1930s over claims such as Noguchi's for B. granulosis , the presence of corneal changes became the defining criterion for real trachoma for many strong characters. Thygeson had putmuch store on the fact that the studies of B. granulosis had not produced these corneal changes, and he used this fact to argue that B. granulosis could not be the causative agent of trachoma.Similar criticisms were laid against any human\"volunteer\" or animal study that did not generatecorneal changes. The third Committee accepted thenecessity to precisely monitor and documentcorneal changes, although they recognised thatthere was \"a difference of opinion in the diagnosticimportance of pannus\". Some very detailedclassification schemes for grading pannus in fieldstudies were devised (99); the proponentsdeveloped considerable skill and accuracy, whetherusing a slit lamp or loupe, and even graded the firstmillimetre of pannus into quarter segments (100).However, the detailed grading of pannus ultimatelyproved to be of little practical use. The WHO trachoma grading system, 1966-81 The fourth WHO Expert Committee (now a Scientific Group) finally tackled the issue oftrachoma grading head on in 1966 (50). Althoughthey did not actively condemn the MacCallanClassification, they did introduce a new gradingsystem. The new system came in two forms: Acould be used for a full examination whichrequired the use of a slit lamp and the staining ofthe cornea, and B was a minimal examinationusing the naked eye or a binocular loupeconsidered suitable for field studies. Twenty signswere to be graded for the slit lamp exam and eightwere used in the minimal exam. Most signs weregraded from 0 to 3, although some were gradedfrom 0 to 2, 4 or 5 (see Table 3.3) (50). Thegrading of these signs, in some cases 22, provedexceedingly tedious to perform in 16 fields andhighly complex to analyse. The concepts ofgrouping signs to give measures of intensity,severity and gravity were further refined. Althoughthe intensity index proved useful and all signs werefurther refined, it seems that the gravity index wasonly used by its originators. This Scientific Group also spent considerable time discussing the issues of distinguishingtrachoma, inclusion conjunctivitis and ocularinfection with the lymphogranuloma venerum(LGV). All three diseases were caused bychlamydia and although agreeing on the differentclinical features of each \"syndrome\", this ScientificGroup recommended continuing research into thisissue. Subsequently, further refinements and modifications to the trachoma grading system wereput forward by the staff of the WHO TrachomaProgram. In 1967, Fakhry Assaad and PeterMaxwell-Lyons more fully developed the conceptof the aggregation of signs of trachoma intocardinal signs for diagnosis, signs that indicatedthe intensity of the disease and the gravity orlikelihood of visual loss (see Table 3.4) (101). The next development in 1973 was the publication of a new WHO grading system byMario Tarizzo (d. 1980), then Director of the WHO T rachoma Program (102). This revised the 1966 WHO Scientific Group Classification andCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS 47 upper cornea, superior corneal pannus, or typicalconjunctival scarring. They also reaffirmed thattrachoma could arise as an acute disease even inthe absence of secondary bacterial or viralinfection; but they considered such an acute onsetto be rare as most cases of uncomplicatedtrachoma had an insidious onset. The third Committee (1962) was particularly concerned with the laboratory methods used todiagnose trachoma (49). Since chlamydia was firstcultured in 1957, there had been a rapid develop-ment in a wide range of laboratory diagnostic tests.The ability to culture chlamydia also opened theway to vaccine development and the Committeedeveloped some guidelines for the design andparameters for vaccine trials. They also formulatedand introduced an index for the clinical grading ofseverity and gravity that was subsequently furtherdeveloped (94). The fourth Committee was also preoccupied with the importance of changes in the superiorcornea; the development of micro and macroscopicpannus, subepithelial opacification and superficialpunctate keratitis. Phillips Thygeson (1903-2002),the Founding Director of the Francis ProctorFoundation in San Francisco, was a man whomade enormous contributions to the field overnearly 70 years. He was also known to hold firmopinions and was one of few people on each of thefour Expert Committees. He stated elsewhere that Figure 3.7 Corneal changes in trachoma (a) the string of small elevated limbal follicles can be seen at the limbus with surrounding pannus (b) very large limbal follicles clearly displacing the vessels in the limbal pannus(c) fine residual pannus after the resolution of fine trachomatous pannus with typical Herbert's 1 20/12/07 2:18 PM Page 46Table 3.3: Fourth WHO Scientific Group on trachoma 1966 (50) Methods of scoring and recording trachoma A.

(1952) Biomicroscopie et histopathologie de l'oeil , Zurich). 3.These scores apply to immature follicles. It is also necessary to record the presence of mature follicles.

They also developed a better definitionof the signs and zones of the tarsus. Barrie Jones,who was familiar with this work, also used thisscale in his studies in Iran (105). This gradingsystem provided the basis for the 1987 simplifiedgrading. However, the refined WHO gradingsystem became quite widely used and is still usedin some research (106). It has a broader range ofcategories and is more useful than subsequentsimplified grading for detailed studies, especiallythose comparing the presence of infection withclinical disease. The grading of the intensity of inflammation was further promoted in a revised WHO TrachomaGrading Manual published in 1981 (107). This newmanual simplified the grading to use just five signs,upper tarsal follicles (F graded 3.6) (107). It defined three zones in theeverted upper lid (see Figure 3.8). The manualcontained useful figures and photographs. The fourstage MacCallan Classification was again describedin this publication.recommended the use of only nine signs to gradetrachoma: upper tarsal follicles (1-4), mention was made of the fourthScientific Group's use of signs to describe relativeintensity and relative gravity, a new definition ofgrave lesions (disabling and/or potentiallydisabling) was given as F 3C1, C3, trichiasis, pannus 4+mm or corneal opacity. Severity wasnow to be expressed as the average (or the sum) ofthe grading of all signs except for papillae, limbalfollicles and Herbert's pits. The MacCallanClassification with the use of TrD for trachomadubium continued to be recommended. In Australia, Fred Hollows (1929-93) and the National Trachoma and Eye Health Program(NTEHP) team developed a somewhat similargrading scheme in 1975, although they gradedonly seven signs, for the first time, one of whichwas specifically trichiasis (103). The NTEHPgraded the presence of superior follicles,papillae and scarring, and Herbert's pits, limbalfollicles and trichiasis, all on a scale of 0-3 exceptpannus, which was graded 0-5. This group gradedwith loupes and a hand torch. This grading wassimple to use, had good reproducibility bothamong observers and between observers and waswidely used in Australia (103). The NTEHP constructed two scales to report their data, one for follicular trachoma and one forcicatricial trachoma. Severe upper tarsal or limbal follicles3 or papillae 3 in Intermediate follicular trachoma or scarring 3, intermediate (CTB) scarring 2or pannus 4, a third category forlesser scarring, pannus and Herbert's pits. Chandler Dawson (1930-), who became the fourth Director of the Proctor Foundation, and agroup working in Tunisia, further developed theidea of assessing the severity of infection anddeveloped an intensity scale based on the WHOgrading system (104). Their intensity of50 TRACHOMA CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS 51 Table 3.6: WHO Trachoma Grading, 1981 (107) The scores follicles (F) are: F0 No follicles F1Follicles present, but no more than five in zones 2 and 3 together F2More than five follicles in zones 2 and 4 together, but less than five in zone 3 F3Five or more follicles in each of the three zones.

In the grading systems discussed here, follicles must be at least 0.5mm in diameter, ie at least as large as those shown Care should be taken to distinguish follicles from spots due to small scars and from degenerative deposits in the conjunctiva. Small scars are not round, but have angular borders with sharp corners, whereas follicles have rounded edges that are not sharply defined. Dege nerative deposits include conjunctival concretions that are yellow or white opaque masses with clear-cut edges, as well as cysts that appear as clearbubbles in the conjunctiva.Trachomatous inflammation - intense (TI): pronounced inflammatory thickening of the upper tarsal conjunctiva that obscures more than half of the normal deep tarsal vessels The key feature of this grade of trachoma is the pronounced inflammatory thickening, which is defined as being present when, in more than halfthe area of the tarsal conjunctiva, the large deep tarsal vessels are not visible because they are obscured by inflammatory infiltration of follicles.In severe trachomatous inflammation, the tarsal conjunctiva appears red, rough and thickened. This is due to diffuse inflammato ry infiltration, oedema, or enlargement of vascular tufts (papillary hypertrophy); also there are usually numerous follicles, which may be partially or totallycovered by the thickened conjunctiva. Inflammatory thickening and opacification of the conjunctiva should not be confused with that caused byscarring, especially diffuse fibrosis or formation of a fibrovascular membrane. Trachomatous scarring (TS): the presence of scarring in the tarsal conjunctiva Scars are easily visible as white lines, bands, or sheets (fibrosis) in the tarsal conjunctiva. Characteristically, they are glistening and fibrous in appearance, with straight, angular or feathered edges. Scarring, especially diffuse fibrosis, may obscure the tarsal blood vessels, and so must not be confused with diffuse inflammatory thickening.Trachomatous trichiasis (TT): at least one eyelash rubs on the eyeball Evidence of recent removal of inturned eyelashes should also be graded as trichiasis.Corneal opacity (CO): easily visible corneal opacity over the pupil This sign refers to corneal scarring that is so dense that at least part of the pupil margin is blurred when viewed through the opacity. The definition is intended to detect corneal opacities that cause significant visual impairment (less than 6/18 or 0.3 vision), and in such cases the visual acuity should be measured if possible.Method of examination The examination should normally be performed with binocular loupes (x2.5) and adequate lighting (either daylight or a torch). If appropriate,loupes of higher magnification or a slit lamp (biomicroscope) can be used, but the same optical aid and level of magnification should be used for all examinations. The grading obtained with a higher magnification may not necessarily be directly comparable to that with x2.5. Eyes should be examined first for inturned eyelashes (TT), and the cornea then scrutinized for opacities (CO). In order to check for inturn ed eyelashes, the upper lid should be pushed upwards slightly to expose the lid margins. The upper eyelid should then be examined for inflamm ation (TF and TI) and scarring (TS). Each eye must be examined and assessed separately. Clinical signs must be clearly seen in order to be considered present. If in doubt, a sign should be regarded as absent. 52 TRACHOMA The WHO simplified grading system, 1987 In the early 1980s, various attempts were made to use these grading systems and to codify them into asingle system for field studies and research(108,109,110). We developed a simplified gradingsystem for our field studies and although there wasgood intra-observer agreement, the agreement wasless consistent (111). However, it becameincreasingly apparent that the existing gradingschemes were confusing, lacked clear descriptionsand were not really suitable for field use. They alsocollected a lot of information that was of little valueand much of which was never analysed orpresented. Why go to all that effort to collect datathat were never used? Dr Bjorn Thylefors had taken over as Director of the WHO Prevention of Blindness Program thatevolved out of the WHO Trachoma Program in1977. Thylefors put together a group of \"experts\"that came to include Dawson, Jones, Daghfous,Pararajasegararan, Lwin, West and myself (seeFigure 3.9). The first stage was to refine the number of signs that were being graded and five were finally RIGHT Figure 3.9 Field testing the prototype WHO simplified grading, (from left to right) Chan Dawson, M Hassayoun, MT Daghfous,driver, Bjorn Thylefors, Fetuhri cicatricial trachoma (established andlate) and corneal scarring (a surrogate for visionloss) as a measure of the impact of trachoma. Eachsign was to be graded present or absent and eachwas mutually independent. The next step was to devise both verbal and visual criteria to define each sign. This is a difficulttask because the skill in grading trachoma involvespattern recognition more easily learnt frompatients, photographs or other visual images,rather than the written word. With a working setof definitions and photographs, extensive observertrials were held in Tunisia. The results were quitegood except for the sign TI that did not have goodreproducibility. The definition of TI was revised,further observer trials were successfully conductedin Burma, and the simplified grading system wasfinalised and published in the WHO Bulletin in 1987 (see Tables 3.7 and 3.8 and Figure 3.10)(112,128). At the same time, a study from Tanzania showed that the grading system could be learntquickly by ophthalmologists and ancillary healthpersonnel (ophthalmic nurses) and was suitable forwidespread use in field studies (113). Furtherstudies showed that with the simplified system,there was generally good agreement between theclinical grading performed in the field and thegrading of photographs (114,115). This isparticularly important for clinical trials andlongitudinal studies where it is almost impossibleto control for observer drift when exams arerepeated months or years apart. As well, it may bedifficult to mask an examiner to the interventionthat has taken place. Photographs taken atdifferent times of study subjects can be graded atthe same time in a masked fashion to control forboth observer drift and observer bias. The grading of TF (the presence of five or more follicles in the upper tarsal conjunctiva) was basedon the 1981 WHO grading of F 2and F3. The zone defined for simplified grading was taken to be thesame at zones 2 and 3 of the 1985 WHO grading.These zones were derived from the division of thetarsal plate into thirds by the fourth WHOScientific Group. For the first time, simplifiedgrading set a minimum size of follicles (0.5mm)and provided an illustration with accurately sized dots. The definition of TS was defined as easily visible scarring. It was intended to be comparable to C 2 in the previous grading. However, field reportssuggest this was used only for more severescarring, possibly because of the fairly advancedscarring shown in the definitional photograph (see Figure 3.11). TT was intended to approximate T/E 2of the previous WHO grading. Before then trichiasis hadnot been graded separately, but served as a sign forthe ultimate grade of tarsal scarring. The inclusionof epilation as evidence of trichiasis was new. Afurther subclassification of TT has been proposedby several authors (116,117). The definition of CO followed the WHO 1981 grading of CC 2of corneal opacity, but relied on the54 TRACHOMA CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS 55 Figure 3.11 Cicatricial trachoma (a) typical basket weave scarring in the tarsal conjunctiva that already leads to (b) single lash trichiasis (in the same eye as (a))(c) advanced trichiasis and dense corneal scarring(d) broken lashes from epilation and dense corneal opacity.(a) (c) (b) (d) Table 3.8: Key measures for assessing the importance of trachoma in a community, WHO, 1987 (128) The proportion of trachoma inflammation (TF, with or without TI) amongst children less than 10 years oldThis demonstrates how widespread the infection is in the community.

CO was selected as anindicator of visual impairment and its definitionwas based on collective experience. I was unawareof a paper at that time which reported 99% ofpeople in Qatar who had central diffuse cornealopacities had visual acuity of < 6/18 (118).Subsequently in Tanzania, 85% had < 6/18 visualacuity (119).As it happened, during a visit to Australia I had shared the provisional grading criteria we had usedin a study (120) with Fred Hollows who liked itssimplicity and straightforwardness. He adopted itas a new grading system in Australia, even thoughthe WHO working definition of TI turned out to beunsatisfactory. Subsequently there were somedifficulties bringing the grading in Australia intoline with the final WHO simplified grading system.TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:19 PM Page 54Reflections on the WHO simplified grading system In general, simplified grading has been taken up with much enthusiasm and has been widely used(121). To my mind, this enthusiasm needs to betempered in two areas: the grading of TI and theuse of the simplified grading system in detailedstudies. First, the grading of the sign TI is quiteproblematic. The key feature of this sign isinflammatory thickening, that is, thickened, red,velvety inflammation and infiltration of the tarsalconjunctiva, often with masses of papillae. TI is ameasure of this marked inflammation in the tarsalconjunctiva (see Figure 3.12). When this sign was developed, an arbitrary decision had to be made as to the extent of theinflammatory thickening required to meet thecriteria for the sign to be present. The obscurationof the underlying tarsal vessels was taken as the indicator of the presence of sufficientinflammatory thickening in that part of theconjunctiva to reach the criteria of TI. The initialdefinition of TI required this degree of thickeningto extend over the whole tarsus so that no normaltarsal vessels could be clearly seen. This followedthe definition used by the fourth WHO ScientificGroup (1966) (Diffuse cellular infiltrationpapillary hyperplasia; pronounced conjunctivathickened and opaque, normal vessels obscured(score 3)). With this extreme definition and theneed for such extensive inflammatory thickening,only a very small number of people were affectedand observer agreement was poor. With the initialdefinition TI was not a particularly useful sign.The revised definition recommended at least halfthe tarsal vessels should be obscured, that is,inflammatory thickening of sufficient depth toobscure tarsal vessels had to extend over at leasthalf the area of the tarsal plate. The reviseddefinition was essentially identical to P 3in the 1981 WHO system. This was more workable andbecame the final definition. Unfortunately, many have misunderstood the definition of TI, and have taken the inability to seetarsal vessels, or even just the presence of rednessof the lid, to be sufficient to grade TI, without anyregard to the presence of inflammatory thickening.This has led to the overgrading of TI. Typically inchildren one might expect the ratio of TF to TI tobe of the order of 3:1 to 10:1 (122,123), but somestudies have reported ratios stronglysuggesting overdiagnosis of TI or else severe,unreported epidemics of acute bacterial or viralconjunctivitis. One study specifically looked foradenovirus in children with trachoma in Tanzania.It found 2% had polymerase Theconjunctivitis in epidemics of adenovirus is ofrelatively short duration (about two weeks). Of more concern is the reported high frequency of TI in elderly people. With densely scarred tarsalplates, the tarsal vessels can be obscured by tarsalscarring. Conjunctival inflammation is alsocommon if there is trichiasis or chronic bacterialconjunctivitis and the conjunctiva will be red. Inneither of these cases is obligatory inflammatorythickening required for TI to be graded present. A recent example of the probable misdiagnosis iswhere 44% of children were reported to have TI,as well as 20% to 30% adults (125). Anotherexample is where TI was seen in 37% of thoseaged over 15 years and everyone over the age of 35 years (126). The overdiagnosis of TI led to itsomission in the most recent revision of the WHOTrachoma Guidelines (127). This may helpstandardise field assessment, but it does mean thatwe are totally reliant on follicles, and it de-emphasises the importance of TI as an indicator ofthe high frequency and load of infection and thehigh risk of subsequent scarring. The second area of concern about the misuse of the simplified grading system has been its use indetailed studies, especially those looking at thecorrelation of infection and clinical signs. This willbe discussed in further detail, but when one isusing the most sophisticated diagnostic orlaboratory tests such as PCR, the assessment ofclinical diseases needs to be as detailed andsensitive as possible. One should surely use the1981 WHO grading system, or possibly thedetailed 1962 grading. It seems an elementarymistake to use a simplified grading system for suchdetailed research analyses. One must remember: The simplified grading system was developed for use by trained non-specialist personnel to provide reliableinformation on trachoma and population-basedsurveys and for the simple assessment of the disease atthe community level. Clearly the system gives a less56 TRACHOMA detailed picture of trachoma than more complexmethods for use by specialists, but should providemore reliable for less experienced observers (112). Since the simplified system was published nearly 20 years ago, it has formed the basis of the GET2020 program of the WHO and SAFE Strategy(127,128). There has been little suggestion forfurther change or refinement. However, at onetime Dawson and co-workers suggested that thedefinition of TF would be strengthened if it weretightened to be the same as F 3in the 1981 WHO grading rather than F2and F3, and if TI had been loosened to be equivalent to P2and P3, rather than exclusively P3(129). This suggestion was based on their 18 year longitudinal examination of thepredictors for scarring and trichiasis in Tunisia,but this has not been further developed. Figure 3.12 TI is characterised by inflammatory thickening (a) typical diffuse inflammatory thickening with many follicles (TF and TI) (b) diffuse red velvety thickening of the tarsal conjunctiva with many small follicles (TF and TI)(c) very extensive inflammatory thickening with marked accumulation of follicles without much redness (TF and TI)(d) old scarred eyelid with no inflammatory thickening, although the tarsal conjunctiva is quite red (TS but not TI).

Thedifficulty in es tablishing the differential diagnosis of trachoma from other forms of infection severelyimpeded the military surgeons of the early 1800s(see T able 3.9) (35). However, by 1900 a reasonable differential diagnosis could be made, inlarge part because of the ability to identify many ofthe bacterial causes of acute and chronicconjunctivitis (see Table 3.10) (15). With theintroduction of Giemsa cytology it became mucheasier to make more specific diagnoses ofchlamydial infection. The differential diagnosis setout by MacCallan (4) is instructive (see Table3.11) (25) and shows an interesting progressionfrom the 1904 list (15). It was not until chlamydia could be cultured that the causative organism for many of thevarious forms of follicular conjunctivitis could beconfirmed. The third WHO Expert Committee still 2006 changes: a new grading? As people gained more experience with simplifiedgrading, it became apparent that knowledge of theprevalence of TS was of relatively little practicaluse, and the prevalence of TI could be quitevariable, possibly due to misclassification asdiscussed above. This led to a further revision bythe WHO in 2006 that recommended data becollected on TF, TT and CO only. TF was to beused as the sign of preference in assessing the needfor trachoma control programs and monitoringresults. TT would indicate people in need ofsurgery and calculate requirements for surgery. COwould continue to be used as an indicator of theburden of blindness and visual impairment due totrachoma (127). What is needed are some bettershort-term measurements of the effect of antibioticcontrol programs (100). Waiting for 20 years todetermine changes in corneal scarring or blindnessis not very useful. The obvious intermediatesurrogate is the presence of conjunctival scarring inchildren using either TS or C 2/C3. This degree of conjunctival scarring incurs a high risk of trichiasisa couple of decades later (129). Testing forinfection may prove useful to determine theefficacy of antibiotic treatment because clinicalsigns may persist long after treatment. Some 2400 years after Hippocrates, we have gone from regarding trachoma as a relativelysimple disease of having a rough lid and latertrichiasis, through increasing degrees ofcomplexity, countless hours or decades of intensearguments, disputes and debates, impossibleclassifications and ever expandingsubclassification, using a multiplicity of terms tobring it all back to a definition of a disease with aroughened lid (TF) and trichiasis (TT). Oh, theprice of progress!

Much effort was spent indifferentiating the signs of inclusion conjunctivitisfrom those of trachoma (130). The 1981 WHOmanual limited the differential diagnosis to casesof chronic follicular conjunctivitis that wereneither caused by chlamydial infection nor bychronic bacterial infection that could often mergeinto endemic trachoma (107) (see Table 3.13). It was probably due to the development ofbetter diagnostic tests that the somewhatephemeral conditions of folliculosis and variouschronic follicular keratoconjunctivitities are nolonger seen. Perhaps these conditions are nowdiagnosed as sporadic chlamydial infections orsome other more recently chlamydial inclusionconjunctivitis and Moraxella conjunctivitis canpersist for more than a month, and LGVconjunctivitis can occur rarely (see Figure 3.13). 60 TRACHOMA Table 3.11: Differential diagnosis of trachoma, MacCallan 1913 (25) This subject may be studied in the following subdivisions: 1.

Can be confirmed with laboratory evidence of C. trachomatis infection. Inclusion conjunctivitis Generally occurs in adults not living in trachoma-endemic areas and is related to the genital strains of C. trachomatis. Viral conjunctivitis Is a common cause of follicles; it can be distinguished from trachoma by an acute history and the presence of a mucopurulent discharge. Bacterial conjunctivitis Bacterial infection, such as Moraxella , can be a rare cause of follicle formation. Hypersensitivity conjunctivitis Occurs following chronic exposure to drugs or eye cosmetics; a careful history is important. Vernal conjunctivitis Is an allergic disorder; patients often have associated atrophy. Symptoms include itchiness, lacrimation, photophobia, foreign body sensation and burning. Parinaud oculoglandular syndrome Is a rare ophthalmic condition that may cause follicles; it is associated with cat-scratch fever, tuberculosis, syphilis,lymphogranuloma venereum glandular fever.Table 3.9: of ophthalmia Egyptian ophthalmia (trachoma) Usually unilateral Usually bilateral Onset more rapid Onset more gradual Becomes severe more gradually Becomes severe rapidly Affects bulbar conjunctiva Affects palpebral conjunctiva Mucous thinner Keratitis occurs infrequently Keratitis is usual Cornea is destroyed from the surface Cornea is destroyed from the underside Table 3.10: Differential diagnosis of trachoma, Boldt and pseudoleukaemiaRetained foreign bodies, seeds, grains, hairs from plants and caterpillars Artifactitious (especially in military conscripts) Scarring Post gonococcal conjunctivitisPost diphtheria conjunctivitisPemphigusBlepharoconjunctivitis.Tables 3.9 to 3.14 show the changing diagnosis oftrachoma from 1841 1 psittaci (psittacosis) and C. felis (cat scratch fever) can rarely produce chronic follicular conjunctivitis. A more up to date differentialdiagnosis is shown in Table 3.14. (See Figure3.14). One also needs to be aware that the concurrence of acute or concomitant bacterial infection was thecause of so much confusion amongst the variousophthalmias of the 19th century. In any areas withendemic blinding trachoma, bacterial conjunctivalpathogens are common (see Figure 3.15). The reported frequency of bacterial conjunctivitis in cases with trachoma varies widelywith the criteria used to define the bacterialinfection. Frank purulent conjunctivitis was seen in2.5% of children Arabia(92) and mucopurulent conjunctivitis in 16% ofchildren in Lebanon (131). In Southern Tunisiahaemophilus species were cultured in 40% ofchildren with trachoma and Moraxella in 16%(132). Another study the same group ofchildren Giemsa identified probablehaemophilus and streptococcus) in 49% (133).A further analysis of data from these children withtrachoma showed that in those who were inclusionpositive 83% had severe intense trachomairrespective of the presence of H. aegyptius infection. However, in those who were inclusionnegative, 28% had intense trachoma in the absenceof H. aegyptius , compared to 68% where H. aegyptius was seen on Giemsa stains (134). Twenty-five per cent of children in Egypt have been reported to have a concomitant bacterialsecondary infection (135). In Palestine, pathogenicbacteria were cultured from 75% of eyes withmoderate to severe trachoma (136). The organismsisolated included staphylococcus aureus,staphylococcus albus and conjunctivitis andneisseria conjunctivitis in Egypt and in July to September have been welldocumented (32,137). In Lebanon these seasonalepidemics have been termed \"harvest\" (July andAugust) and \"fig\" (August and September)conjunctivitis (131). Similar epidemics are reportedCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS 63 Figure 3.15 The severe purulent discharge associated with gonococcal conjunctivitis. across North Africa including Tunisia (138) and Morocco (139). Dacryocystitis and dacryoadenitiswere found to occur three times more commonly inthose with trachoma than those without, andcorneal ulceration was four times more common inthose with trachoma (136). There was no increasedfrequency of herpes simplex viral keratitis. It is important to remember some of the othercauses of tarsal scaring that may include kerato-conjunctivitis. Severeblepharitis with chalazion can also cause tarsalscarring that may at times be confusing. In each ofthese conditions, fine corneal pannus may also beevident. 62 TRACHOMATRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:20 PM Page 62CHAPTER FOUR Laboratory diagnosis In trachoma, the lack of simple, definitive, laboratory diagnostic procedures suitable for wide application has placed the onus largely and usually exclusively, on clinical observation FAKHRY ASSAAD & P ETER MAXWELL -LYONS , 1967 The laboratory diagnosis of chlamydial infection in general, and trachoma in particular, has been frustrated by the frequent occurrence of apparently false negative tests HUGH TAYLOR , 1991 MANY STUDIES BY a wide range of people in the early 1800s had shown that ophthalmia (or trachoma) could be transferred by means of inoculation of ocular discharge from one eye to another or from an eye to a urethra (35). For many people, this confirmed the contagiousnature of trachoma. However, it was not until Louis Pasteur (1822-95) irrefutablydemonstrated the presence of bacteria in the 1860s, that the theory of spontaneous generationwas disproved. With the work of Robert Koch (1843-1910) in Berlin that established thegerm theory of disease in the 1870s, the notion that trachoma could be acquired from themyasm was finally dispelled. Quickly thereafter, bacteriological knowledge exploded withthe rapid identification of a multitude of organisms. Albert Neisser (1855-1916) identified the gonococcus Neisseria gonorrhea in 1879, the fourth bacteria to be identified. In 1884 Koch went with Neisser and a French team to Egypt to study cholera where Koch identifiedthe Koch-W eeks bacillus, subsequently . In 1896 the Morax and Axenfeld bacillus was first identified in Egypt by Victor Morax, subsequently renamedNeiserria catarrhalis and then Moraxella catarrhalis (141). Trachoma was considered to be a viral disease, an infectious disease for which a bacteria had not been identified (15). It was suggested it shared many similarities with malaria andmay be caused by a plasmodium. Like malaria, it also seemed to have two types: one foundin people living in marshes and delta regions and the other associated with dry dusty areas. 65 TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:20 PM Page 64It was the era-defining confirmed the infective nature of trachoma (142). For the first time, this enabled a definitive positive laboratory identification of the trachomaorganism, hence the laboratory diagnosis oftrachoma. Although Giemsa cytology wasessentially 100% specific, it had a low sensitivity , and the issue of the low sensitivity of subsequenttests combined with the inability to demonstrateorganisms in every case of clinical trachoma,continues to bedevil the field a century later. Giemsa cytology Gustav Giemsa (1867-1948) of the Hamburg hadexplored the number of analine dye derivativesdeveloped in Germany at the turn of the century.Austrians Stanislaus Batavia (Jakarta) with Neisser to study experimental syphilis infections in monkeys . They found trachoma was common and undertookfurther experimental studies, first infecting orangutans with conjunctival secretions (142). The orang utans developed an conjunctivitis with marked tissue swelling but follicles andtrachomatous scarring were not reported. However , the infection did spread to the opposite eye and thesecretions could be used to infect other orang utans. Conjunctival scrapings from orang utans were stained stain and showed the nowcharacteristic blue intracycloplasmic inclusions.Halbestaedter and von Prowazek also recognisedsmall red bodies they called \"elementary bodies\"(see Table 4.1, Figure 4.1). The blue inclusion bodywas thought to be a \"plastin-like\" mantle or cloakthat concealed or masked the tiny red elementarybodies. This led to the name Chlamydozoa or\"mantled bodies\". Similar inclusions and freeelementary bodies were seen in scrapings frompatients with active trachoma, but were not seen intreated or old cases of trachoma. In 1907 Nicolle and colleagues in Tunis had already confirmed the infectiousness of this agent inmonkeys and they undertook a range of verysophisticated studies in monkeys and humans(143). They showed the agent was small and passedthrough a fine Berkefeld V filter . It could be destroyed by heating to 50 \u00b0C and by drying forone hour at 32 \u00b0C. Karl Lindner (1883-1961), an ophthalmologist in V ienna, had identified the complete life cycle of chlamydia between 1910 and 1913 (144,145). Hedemonstrated that the inclusion was made of manyblue-staining reticular bodies, each of which wouldcondense to form an elementary body. He alsoundertook experimental infections in baboons (146). The findings of Halberstaedter and von Prowazek were controversial. Their inclusionscould be found in cases of ophthalmia neonatorumand gonococcal ophthalmia, and many questionedthe specificity of the conclusions. Subsequently, it was shown that inclusions were present inpatients with ophthamia neonatorum, inclusionconjunctivitis and urethritis from whomgonococcus could not be (147,148). In the 1930s Thygeson conducted some quite66 TRACHOMA Table Description of chlamydial by Halberstaedter & von Prowazek (142) In the Giesma-stained preparations, dark blue, non-homogenous irregular inclusions were visible within the epithelial cells in the light blue protoplasm near the nucleus (first observed by von Prowazek). These initially small round or oval deposits gradually grew larger, assumed a mulberry-like form and, simultaneously with progressive enlargement, underwent an increasing disaggregation which sta rted in the centre. Eventually, they mostly assumed a cap-shaped form over the nucleus. Within these inclusions red-stained, discrete, very fine particles appear, which rapidly multiply, displacing the blue-stained masses and gradually causing their disappearance. Finally, they occupy the greater part of the protoplasm, whereas the blue-stained substa nces are evident only as small islands between them. In the smears one can also observe free particles besides the cells. In some animals these inclusions disappeared after about a week and reappeared several days later. Figure 4.1 Giemsa cytology TOP low power view to show an epithelial cell with an inclusion and the mixed inflammatory cellular exudate with both lymphocytes and polymorphs BOTTOM high power view to show intracytoplasmic inclusions in epithelial cells, again with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate.TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:20 PM Page 66tarsus (see Figure 4.2). Later the tarsi were act ually removed for histology so further observations were confined to the fornix conjunctiva. Superior fornixfollicles in monkeys are common; they are a non-specific sign of conjunctival inflammation and onceinduced, may remain for months or years inotherwise \"quiet\" eyes. T o my mind, Noguchi had not produced disease that looked anything liketrachoma. A second problem Noguchi faced wastuberculosis in his monkey colony. In differentstudies he notes some 10% to 15% of his monkeysdied from tuberculosis. It is impossible to determinewhat impact this may have had on his findings. Robbins summarised more than 100 papers published between 1927 and 1935 on B. granulosis(155). Sixteen laboratories confirmed Noguchi'sisolation of B. granulosis from trachoma but in many papers, the work was not well described orsubstantiated. Another 15 laboratories could notrepeat the work. Interestingly, Thygeson was listedin each group with different collaborators. Therewere eight reports of successful infection inmonkeys and two reports of failure, one by Wilsonin Egypt and another by Proctor, Finnoff andThygeson. Finally, Robbins lists 23 reportedattempts to infect human volunteers; only onevolunteer became infected and was graded asTrachoma Stage III by Proctor. Thygeson reportedthat another boy developed trachoma afterinoculation (149). Robbins concluded that Noguchi had isolated a previously unknown organism from cases oftrachoma. This organism induced a \"granularconjunctivitis\" in monkeys that was not identical totrachoma and that human experiments had beenfailures. For these reasons B. granulosis could not be considered the cause of trachoma (155). This controversy around B. granulosis generated a lot of intensity and finally it was accepted that theinitial observations were flawed. However, the key finding that was used to discredit the animalstudies was the absence of corneal changes. Theparamount importance of the presence of cornealchanges in trachoma was subsequently transferredto the clinical grading of trachoma and included inthe WHO grading systems of the 1950s, 1960s and1970s. It was finally discontinued in the 1980s.Even when chlamydia was cultured in 1957,monkey experiments were dismissed because singleinoculations did not lead to marked pannus orchronic disease. The notion that a single infectionwould lead to blindness in trachoma was eventuallyproven to be inappropriate, as the importance ofrepeated episodes of reinfection became recognised. Chlamydial culture The second major revolution in the identification ofchlamydia occurred in Beijing in 1957 when T'angFeifan (1897-1958), Chang (Zhang) Xiaolou(1914-90), Huang Yuantong (1924-) and WangKeqian (1923-) from Tong Ren Hospital (seeFigure 4.3) successfully isolated the trachoma\"virus\" in a chick embryo (156). They reported theisolation of three strains of chlamydia obtainedfrom humans with trachoma. Four innovations made the Chinese break- through possible. First, they inoculated theirsamples into the egg yolk of the embryonated egg,rather than the chorio allantoic membrane. Otherworkers had assumed that because chlamydiainfected epithelial cells, if they were to grow in anegg culture they would grow in the chorio allantoicmembrane not in the yolk sac, although the yolk sacculture of LGV had been in use for some time (157).Their second innovation was the concomitant use ofpenicillin and streptomycin. Fortuitously, theseantibiotics were essentially ineffective againstchlamydia, but they prevented bacterialcontamination that would otherwise haveLABORATORY DIAGNOSIS 69 extraordinary experiments, preparing sterile filteredpreparations of purified elementary bodies fromchildren with trachoma and infected humanvolunteers and baboons (149,150). This confirmed that elementary bodies from the inclusions ofchlamydiae could be transmitted to cause infection. Giemsa cytology became the standard laboratory test for trachoma and it is hard to estimate howmany hundreds of thousands of hoursmicroscopists have spent carefully scanning slidesfor the elusive inclusions. T ypical smears, for example, may have 500 to 5000 cells, but mightonly include one or two inclusions (151). Somelaboratories accepted slides with as few as 50 cells (131). Although there were multiple steps in the collection and processing of a Giemsa smear wheremistakes could be made, the single most criticalcomponent was the skill, experience and patienceof the cytologist. In addition to epithelial cells and inclusions a range of inflammatory cells and bacteria can berecognised with Giemsa cytology . The cells include Polymophonuclear neutrophils, and plasma cells, blastoid cells, Leber cells (macrophages with cytoplasmic debris) andmultinucleated cytology were attemptedincluding scoring of the inflammatory cellscontained in the smear (153). The intracytoplasmicinclusions could also be stained with iodine andiodine staining was advocated by someinvestigators as a cheaper alternative, although this reduced the sensitivity even further (152). Bacillus granulosis Many people from countries around the worldcontinued to attempt to culture and identifychlamydial organisms that could be seen inGiemsa-stained inclusions. Over time, differentbacteria were described, but until the 1950s noneof the claims were substantiated. Perhaps the mostnotable of these was the discovery of Bacillus granulosis by Noguchi. Hideyo Noguchi Noguchi Memorial Institute for MedicalResearch in Accra, Ghana, is named after him. In1927, he isolated a new bacterium from the eyes ofAmerican Indians with trachoma in New Mexico(154). Noguchi initiated extensive studies in avariety of primates. He also shared his isolate withother laboratories (154), but unfortunately died the following year in Ghana while studying yellowfever . His work was continued by colleagues for some time and others tried to repeat his workelsewhere. There was uncertainty as to whether theminute organism was a Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacillus, and various attempts to inducetrachoma in orang utans, chimpanzees and rhesusmonkeys by others were mostly unsuccessful or notrepeatable. For example, samples of the organismsent to Egypt were found to be ineffective andothers could not identify B. granulosis from patients with trachoma (4). By 1935 researchershad discarded the notion that B. granulosis was the cause of trachoma (155). It is instructive to look at this episode because it shows some of the difficulties of working withtrachoma, casts some light on the relation betweeninfection and disease, and shows the role forcefulpersonalities can play in shaping current and futureperceptions. Noguchi was a careful and respected researcher in a leading laboratory. He went toconsiderable lengths to collect specimens fromIndian children in Albuquerque with Stage II(active) trachoma (154). He had assistance from Dr Francis Proctor (1864-1936) and the IndianMedical Service. The organism he isolated wasdifficult to grow and grew best in a semi-solidleptospira medium. To confirm the pathogenicity of B. granulosis, he used a monkey model. The monkeys were infected by subconjunctivalinjections of B. granulosis into the upper fornix followed by scarification of the conjunctiva.Twenty-one of 25 monkeys developed at least\"mild subacute\" conjunctivitis, which Noguchiclaimed to be trachoma, but the elusive organism could only be re-isolated occasionally, one to fivemonths after inoculation. Several attempts weremade to inoculate two chimps and an orang utanbut the results are difficult to interpret. The drawings Noguchi made of the upper lid show follicles in the upper fornix, but none on the68 TRACHOMA Figure 4.2 Conjunctivae of Macacus rhesus 824 days after inoculation with culture. Follicles can be seen in the upper fornix bordering the tarsus but only some encroaching on thesuperior tarsus (Noguchi 1928 (154); Reproduced fromJournal 2:20 PM Page 68overgrown the chlamydia and destroyed the embryo. Bacterial contamination had been a majorbarrier in attempts to culture chlamydia. Third, theyincubated the eggs at 35 oC, the temperature of the conjunctiva, rather than 37 oC. Finally, T'ang used repeated blind passage where the contents of oneinoculated egg were reinoculated into new eggs. Therepeated passaging of material increased thelikelihood of finally obtaining a positive culture. Having isolated chlamydia, T'ang and colleagues immediately undertook a series of experiments tocharacterise the new organism. They assessed itsphysical characteristics and tested its susceptibilityto heat, pH change, drying, freezing, freeze-thawing and various chemical inactivationmethods, including glycerine, alcohol and formalin.They also tested its susceptibilities to the range ofavailable antibiotics and identified its susceptibilityto sulphonamides and tetracycline. They conductedanimal experiments and infected mice, rabbits,guinea pigs, pigeons and hens without success.They were able to produce acute, inclusion-positiveconjunctivitis in rhesus monkeys that developed aself-limited acute conjunctivitis within seven to 10days, lasting two to three months. Two of theirseven monkeys had inclusions on Giemsa stain(156). They performed preliminary studies withtissue culture of conjunctival epithelium but thesewere unsuccessful. They initiated toxicity studies byinjecting mice with chlamydia intravenously or intothe brain. They subsequently reported thesuccessful infection of volunteers with culturedmaterial (158). The culture of chlamydia was an amazing breakthrough and in a noteworthy spirit ofinternational collaboration, the Chinese sharedspecimens so that Collier and his group in Londonwere soon able to grow chlamydia, andsubsequently cultured new isolates from TheGambia (159). Similarly, within a few years groupsaround the world were growing new isolates. However there is another part to this story. In 1937, Atilis Macchiavello, a Chilean consultantepidemiologist working with the Pan AmericanSanitary Bureau in Lima, Peru, developed a newstain (Macchiavello Stain) that detected bothrickettsia and chlamydia (160). In 1943, he obtained conjunctival scrapings from a 17-year -old Ecuadorian student with typical Stage II trachomaand inoculated this into the yolk sacs of seven eggs(161,162). Despite contamination in a number of eggs, infection that developed in the remaining eggsshowed characteristic intracellular inclusions,reticulate bodies and free elementary bodies. Thismaterial remained sterile in bacterial culture andcould be passaged serially . A six-year-old child was experimentally infected and developed acuteconjunctivitis within six days, and by three weekshad started to develop corneal vascularisation. Thechild was treated with sulphonamides with areduction of symptoms within four days, wasessentially normal at two months and completelycured at one year. Inclusions were identified inconjunctival scrapings at day 10 and the agent wasre-isolated by egg culture. These exciting experiments were overlooked by other workers in the field. They were published inSpanish during the middle of the Second WorldWar from a relatively peripheral centre by someonewho was not known to be working in the field.However, a summary of these findings waspublished in English after the war in 1948 (163). T wo groups picked up this work and confirmed the findings (164,165). To reduce contamination of theeggs, the Egyptian group first inoculated the eyes ofbaboons and grivets with trachoma scrapings(165). They then took further scrapings from theinfected monkeys that were used to inoculate eggs.By using serial passage from monkey to egg tomonkey, they were able to serially pass theorganism multiple times. Without antibioticsattempts at repeated egg passage would rapidlybecome infected. When infected with the culturedorganism, monkeys developed a typical follicularconjunctivitis at about 14 days. Unfortunately the work of Macchiavello was not fully accepted. The report was consideredincomplete and the number of experiments wasrelatively small (148). Further, Macchiavello didnot or could not share his isolate with otherlaboratories for confirmation. His impressiveresults failed to receive the attention they probablydeserved. In 1956, the second WHO ExpertCommittee formulated the following criteria tovalidate the isolation of chlamydia: typicalinclusions needed to be demonstrated on serialcultures, the agent needed to induce experimentaltrachoma in monkeys, a serologic relationshipbetween the cultured virus and trachoma needed tobe established and finally human infectionexperiments were required (33). In contrast, the work of the Beijing group was undoubtedly aided by the use of streptomycin.They were able to produce large quantities ofchlamydia in the laboratory and undertook animpressive range of studies to characterise theirorganism. However, they did not initially undertakethe human experimental infections until later.Moreover, they were able to provide their isolate toother workers in the field, particularly to the groupworking in London, who rapidly extended thiswork and isolated further strains. AlthoughMacchiavello may have been the first to culturechlamydia, it was the work of T'ang and colleaguesthat really changed perceptions in the field. Theability to culture chlamydia led to an explosion ofresearch activity. Work progressed at a rapid paceto develop serology testing and vaccines, refine theculture method, study the life cycle includingstudies with the newly available electronmicroscope, and assess growth characteristics andfurther antibiotic susceptibility studies. A wholenew research field had thus been initiated. There was a lot of confusion about nomenclature and the general recognition ofsimilarity, but also significant differences betweentrachoma and inclusion conjunctivitis, as the general term chlamydiawas finally widely accepted (see chapter five). Tissue culture methods Although considered an outstanding technicaladvance, embryonated or fertilised egg culture wasextraordinarily tedious, difficult, expensive andslow. It required careful attention and considerablelaboratory skill. Laboratories performing eggculture would have dozens of fertile eggs deliveredeach week. After inoculation on day six, eggs wereexamined and \"candled\" each day until harvestingat nine to 13 days. Often two further blindpassages were performed before a specimen wasdeclared negative and laboratory accidents weredifficult to avoid. Researchers looked for other ways to grow chlamydia. The first effective tissue culture methodwas described by Gordon and Quan from theNaval Medical Research Institute in Bethesda(166). They used a monolayer of McCoy cellsirradiated to prevent further multiplication. McCoycells were a transformed mouse fibroblast line.Glucose had been added to the media to make theelementary bodies (EB) \"more sticky\" and afterinoculation, cells and culture werecentrifuged to bring the chlamydia into contactwith the monolayer's cell surface to facilitate cell70 TRACHOMA Figure 4.3 The Chinese scientists credited with the first reliable culture of chlamydia FROM LEFT TO RIGHT Dr T'ang, Dr Chang, Dr Huang, Dr Wang, (courtesy, Hu Ailian).LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS 71TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:20 PM Page 70adhesion and EB uptake. With a series of minor modifications, this became the standard tissueculture method. Tissue culture was shown to be atleast as sensitive as egg culture, but much cheaperand more convenient. It was also faster and lesssusceptible to bacterial contamination. Over time, other modifications to tissue culture included the use of HeLa cells, a human cell line ofcervical origin, the use of idoxuridine orcyclohexamide instead of irradiation to inhibit celldivision, the change from vials to microtitre platesand the use of DEAE-dextran instead of glucose toimprove EB adhesion (see Figure 4.4). Various stains were used to identify infected cells. Iodine was used initially, but both polyclonaland monoclonal immunoperoxidase and immuno-fluorescence detection have also been used (seeFigure 4.5). A positive culture isolation is definitive proof of the presence of viable chlamydia and for this reasonculture was regarded as the \"gold standard\" forchlamydial detection. However, culture methodshave a finite sensitivity and some 10 to 100 EB maybe required to be inoculated to obtain one inclusion.Specimens for tissue culture need to be carefullystored and shipped, and strict attention paid to themaintenance of a continuing cold chain of storagefrom the field to the laboratory. Tissue culture issusceptible to inhibition and infection and multipleblind passages may be required before a particularculture becomes positive. At times, non-viable EBcan be seen in negative cultures. Blind passage mayincrease the positive isolation rate. Using up to sixblind passages 84% of cultures were positive on thefirst passage, 10.2% on the second, 4.7% on thethird, and 1.1% on the fourth to sixth passage(167). DFA and PCR studies have confirmed thatspecimens that only become positive after multipleblind passages have lower numbers of EB than thosespecimens that are positive on the first passage(167,168). Culture is still a relatively slow procedure requiring several days to obtain an initial result andlonger for each blind passage. It requires speciallyequipped laboratories with specially trained andskilful staff. Although tissue culture became thestandard in reference and research laboratories, itwas not widely used outside these dedicatedfacilities.Serology The first serologic diagnostic test for chlamydiawas developed in the 1930s (169). It was acomplement fixation assay that used a groupspecific polysaccharide antigen prepared fromcultures of either the psittacosis agent or LGV.Although regarded as an advance at the time, it hadpoor specificity because of broad cross reactivity. Itwas not widely used for trachoma, but was usedquite extensively for psittacosis and LGV diagnoses(170). When more specific tests were developedcomplement fixation was rapidly superseded. TheFrei Test (a skin test) was developed to diagnoseLGV. It used LGV heat-inactivated antigen initiallyobtained from LGV discharge and later cultured inmonkey or mouse brains (170). The ability to culture chlamydia also provided antigen and paved the way for a new range ofserologic tests (50). Many laboratories started todevelop their own serology assays includingneutralisation tests using serum, and micro-agglutination tests using purified elementarybodies. Other work included skin testing withelementary body preparations. A radio isotopeprecipitation (RIP) test was subsequently developedthat used group specific antigen, which was moresensitive than the complement fixation test(105,171). The development of the micro- immunofluorescence PingWang (1920-2001) serology. This test was first explained indetail with a series of papers at the 1970Symposium on Trachoma held in Boston(172,173,174,175) and expanded in 1977 (176). A range of type-specific polyclonal antibodies had been developed by Wang. He used these toserotype different strains of chlamydia. Wang andGrayston identified the four classical trachomastrains, A, B, Ba and C, as well as the three mostcommon genital strains: D, E and F and the threeLGV L 1, L2and L3. Wang's microIF classification was an order ofmagnitude more sophisticated than theclassification being developed by the Harvardgroup who had identified only three types ofchlamydia (177). The ability to serotype chlamydiaalso made redundant ongoing attempts to classifychlamydia by antigen identification using gel72 TRACHOMA Figure 4.4 Chlamydial inclusions in tissue culture of cyclohexamide treated McCoy cells TOP stained with iodine stain BOTTOM stained with fluorescent monoclonal antibody. RIGHT Figure 4.5 Plating out a chlamydial culture in a microtitre plate. TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:20 PM Page 72gained rapid and widespread adoption (188) (see Figure 4.6). Although specificity could still be a problem with genital specimens due to non-specific stainingof genital discharge, bacteria and other debris ingenital specimens, the specificity with ocularspecimens was usually very high. The sensitivitywas superior to Giemsa cytology and tissue culture,both in longitudinal studies in infected animals(189) and in human ocular infection (190,191,192,193,194). An adequate DFA cytology specimen required 100 to 200 epithelial cells. An advantage of acytology specimen over a swab for culture or othertests was that one could assess the adequacy ofeach cytology specimen. A study in Tanzaniashowed that 11% of specimens collected in thefield had an inadequate number of cells, althoughsome of the slides with small numbers of cells stillhad EB identified and could be graded positive(167). However, compared to tissue culture, fortrachoma, DFA had a sensitivity of 88% and aspecificity of 87%. This relatively low specificitymay have been a reflection of the lower sensitivityof the putative \"gold standard\" of culture, whichwas to become more of an issue in the assessmentof the even more sensitive, new DNA-based tests to be discussed in the next section. Although muchquicker to read than Giemsa cytology, a DFA slide could still take up to one hour to readcarefully (195). Five EB was found to be theoptimal cut point for a positive test for trachomaspecimens (167). Lavelle Hanna and co-workers reported a marked increase in positivity of fluorescentantibody cytology following rescraping (151). Theinclusion count increased on rescraping in 66%,compared to a decrease in the inclusion count seenin 6% of individuals. The positivity rate more thandoubled when people were rescraped one to sevendays later. This was attributed to the trauma of thescraping leading to an increase in the rate ofpositivity, although it could equally have been dueto increased non-specific staining in inflamed,previously scraped eyes as relatively non-specificpolyclonal antibodies were used. An effect of thismagnitude has not been reported by other authors. Using DFA, the discordant rate of specimens taken five minutes apart was 10% and 25% for those taken two days or more apart (195).Specimen adequacy could be determined in each case by identifying epithelial cells. Thisinconsistency in positive specimens was attributed diffusion, mouse toxicity testing and other studies. In addition, Wang and co-workers presented detailed serologic studies demonstrating serotype-specific IgM and IgG antibodies in serum, IgG andIgA in tears (174) and the correlation of the serumIgM with active infection (176). Antibodies to thetype-specific antigen were also found to beneutralising (175). The presence of tear antibodieswas more closely correlated with clinical diseasethan serum antibodies (178). Subsequent work byHarlan Caldwell showed these antibodies weredirected against the major outer membrane protein(MOMP) (179). By 1973 the WHO recommended the microF assay (102,105,153). Although this was a veryuseful test, it was still susceptible to minor changesand required considerable expertise to performreliably. Variability was reduced with the generationof much \"cleaner\" and more specific monoclonalantibodies in the 1980s (180). Many laboratoriesdepended on slides prepared by Dr Wang in Seattleinstead of preparing their own reagents (167). MicroF serology was quite widely used in animal studies, various trachoma vaccine trials and field studies (105,181). Although tear anti-chlamydial IgG and IgA titres correlated with thepresence of active disease were serovar specific, thecorrelation was not strong and less specific thanimmunofluorescent cytology (167). However,serology was much more widely used fordiagnosing sexually transmitted diseases thantrachoma (171). As distinct from ocular infection,genital tract infection was not amenable to readyclinical diagnosis or Giemsa cytology, and culturewas problematic. Over time, as better diagnostictests were developed, serology has gradually beenabandoned. Direct immunofluorescent cytology The ability to culture chlamydia provided a supplyof purified elementary bodies that could be used toimmunise animals to produce specific antibodies.This allowed the development of fluorescentantibody cytology that used polyclonal antibodiesto detect infection (182). Immunofluorescentcytology was found to be more sensitive thannormal Giemsa stain, and twice as sensitive andmuch more convenient than egg culture (183).Fluorescent cytology was also much easier andquicker to read than Giemsa cytology. Nichols and collaborators from Harvard used quantitative immunofluorescent cytology fordetailed studies of the community load of chlamydiainfection in Saudi Arabia (92). They demonstrated avery high level of positivity in children under the ageof four years. The highest number of inclusionswere seen in children aged between three and ninemonths, although age specific prevalence rates ofpositive cytology continued to increase up to 36months. Young children under the age of one year,were the most prolific shedders of chlamydia, Fluorescent was anexciting advance. For the first time it allowedmeaningful quantification of the infectious bacterialload of individuals. Not all polyclonal preparations were sufficiently specific and cross-reactivity was a problem. Onestudy in American Indian children demonstratedthat 35% with either no trachoma or TrachomaStage IV tested positive with fluorescent cytology(184). The authors concluded that \"beyond doubtTRIC agent antigen occurs in persons withoutevidence of inflammation and clinical activity in theconjunctiva\" and postulated at length aboutsubclinical or latent infections. However, they wereunable to culture chlamydia from these eyes andmany had persistently positive fluorescent cytology,even after topical tetracycline treatment. Theseaberrant findings were more likely to have beendue to cross-reactive antibodies with a poorspecificity that gave false positive results, ratherthan a new, transiently observed, biologicalphenomenon. These antibodies could adhere non-specifically to bacteria in the smear, for example.With time, better, more specific polyvalent serawere developed, and fluorescent cytology becamethe method of choice for the laboratory diagnosisof trachoma (105,152,185). The identification and subsequent purification of MOMP (186) and the development of monoclonalantibody technology led to the next advance inchlamydial diagnosis. Direct antibody(DFA) antibodies gave asignificant improvement specificity and whenproduced commercially, the MicroTrak test (Syva)74 TRACHOMA LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS 75 Figure 4.6 Direct fluorescent antibody cytology (DFA) showing LEFT brilliantly staining cytoplasmic inclusion in an epithelial cell and multiple single extracellular elementary bodies. Inflammatory cells can also be seen RIGHT scattered extracellular EB.TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:20 PM Page 74either probing or amplification techniques. The rapid developments in DNA biology andtechniques in the 1980s were also applied todevelop tests to detect chlamydial infection. Thefirst generation of nucleic acid detection tests useda radio labelled DNA probe to bind to the targetDNA. The first DNA hybridisation detection ofchlamydia was reported in 1985 (207). Later a nonradioactive DNA probe (GenProbe Pace II) becamecommercially available (204,208,209). Theseassays used a DNA probe directed to the DNA inthe cryptic plasmid contained in all serovars of C. trachomatis not present in the other chlamydial species. This assay gave a sensitivity of 93% with adisappointing specificity of 83%. DNA probe testswere not widely used in trachoma (see Figure 4.9).Several probe assays to detect ribosomal RNA werealso developed, although they had limited use(200,210). The development of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) lifted the detection of chlamydia toa higher plane by using nucleic acid amplification.By cleverly using the ability of DNA to replicate,PCR essentially provided a \"photocopier\" thatallowed minute amounts of specific sequences ofchlamydial DNA to be multiplied to give sufficientquantities of DNA for easy detection. This involveda significant increase in complexity and cost (seeFigure 4.10). In 1989, Deborah Dean and colleagues from San Francisco reported the first use of PCR amplifiedDNA probes to assess trachoma (211). They used aprobe to the 7.0-KB cryptic plasmid and comparedPCR to tissue culture with repeated blind passageand to DFA. On replicate specimens collected fromchildren with trachoma in Nepal, PCR had asensitivity of more than 96% compared to tissueculture and was 100% specific. Three studies using PCR to detect C. trachomatis were presented back to back at the 1990International Chlamydial Meeting in Harrison HotSprings (212,213,214). Two of these studies relatedto sexually transmitted diseases, but the thirddiscussed patients presenting with chlamydialto both sampling variation and biologic variationin shedding. Both problems have continued tohaunt the laboratory diagnosis of trachoma (196).Another study reported the detection of humanDNA in only 70% of samples when tested by PCR(124). A more recent study found levels of humanDNA confirmed that more than 100 cells had beencollected in each specimen (197). Advances in diagnostic technology also led to the development of a direct antigen detection byenzyme immunoassay (EIA). This technique initiallywas called enzyme linked detected swabs. immunoassay involves thebinding of antichlamydial antibodies to antibodies detection of anumber of commercial EIA kits became available.Probably the most widely used was Chlamydiazyme(Abbott) that used a polyclonal antibody to identifya number of antigens including LPS and MOMP(200) (see Figure 4.7). Another popular test was theIDEIA (Boots CellTECH) that used a mousemonoclonal antibody against chlamydiallipopolysaccharide. EIA were easy to perform, large batches of specimens could be processed at one time and EIAspecimens did not require refrigeration. Theenzyme induced colour change that indicated apositive test was machine-read and commercial kitscontained all the reagents required. However, EIAtests were also susceptible to false positives fromcross reaction with contaminating bacteria. Thiswas observed in some trachoma specimens, but wasmore of a problem in genital tract specimens wherethe bacterial contamination was more frequent andof a much higher load (201). With trachoma field specimens EIA performed slightly less well than DFA cytology, but were lessdependent on laboratory technical experience(195). EIA were not used widely in trachomaresearch with the exception of the London groupworking in The Gambia (126,202,203) but thesetests were extensively used in STD clinics fordiagnosing genital infection (200). Overall, thesensitivity of the EIA for eye specimens was of theorder of 80% to 95%. The lack of specificity reallyprecluded the use of EIA tests for rectal orpharyngeal specimens. Further improvement and refinement led to second generation EIA withincreased sensitivity . The use of confirmatory or blocking assays may have increased their specificityto around 99% (204). However, commenting on EIA, Julius Schachter (1936-), Professor of Laboratory Medicine at theUniversity of California, San Francisco, and aleader in chlamydial diagnostics and research,stated: All positive results seem to be accepted as valid. The same holds true, in a sense, with amplified DNAprobes, where researchers often accept positive resultsas the truth without the adequate verification systems.Such an uncritical approach of accepting laboratoryresults is liable to cause considerable misunder-standing about the distribution of chlamydialinfection and their clinical spectrum (204). It is still worth reflecting on Schachter's words today. EIA tests were eventually replaced as the detection of DNA became possible with nuclearacid amplification (NAAT) tests. However in 2006,a new EIA test specifically developed for detectingtrachoma was reported (205). This rapid test or\"point of care assay\" was developed as a \"dipstick\" to detect chlamydial lipopolysaccharide. Ithas a sensitivity threshold of about 2500 EB per testand is thought not to cross react with the commonlyfound human ocular pathogenic bacteria. The initialstudy compared the new test to a PCR test andfound that the dip stick test had a sensitivity of 84%and a specificity of 99.5% (205). It was easy and rapid to perform and four novice operators hadvery high inter- and intra-agreement. It will beinteresting to follow the future development of thisrelatively cheap, quick and deceptively \"lowtechnology\" test, to see if it replaces the clinicalgrading of trachoma to monitor trachoma rates inprevention programs (206) (see Figure 4.8). Nuclear Acid Amplification Tests (NAAT) Nucleic acid detection is the newest and mostsensitive test and relies on the identification ofunique chlamydial DNA or RNA sequences using76 TRACHOMA ABOVE Figure 4.7 The self- contained instrument provided for reading the Chlamidiazyme EIAassay. RIGHT Figure 4.8 Field assessment of the new point-of-care EIA test(courtesy, Claude Michel). TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:20 76specimens in trachoma studies (see Figure 4.11). Eversion of the upper lid is required and a series ofspecimens are collected from one person afteranother. All schoolchildren in a class or allmembers of a family or community are likely to beplaced in line and examined one after the other. Inother settings, such as in an STD clinic, specimencontamination may be much less important. Specimen contamination can occur in multiple ways. The most obvious is the specimen collectorswho may have chlamydial EB or DNA on theirfingers and contaminate a specimen. During eitherexamination or cytology specimen collection, mosttrachoma field staff were not accustomed toscrupulously scrubbing their hands to remove alltraces of foreign DNA between cases. In someareas, such as Tunisia or Egypt, the provision ofalcohol swabs for wiping the fingers after eachexamination was supposed to be part of a long-standing ritual, but more often than not, they saton the shelf unused. Only recently have thosecollecting PCR swabs started to glove andspecifically wash their hands between handlingeach case (197,217). Another very potent source of contamination can be an assistant who holds the child's head andmay evert or \"flip\" the lid to facilitate specimencollection. These staff may well carry EB orchlamydial DNA from one eye to the next. To date,I am not aware of any instances in large fieldstudies that have collected specimens for PCRwhere individuals have separately gloved andwashed their hands between each case.Inadvertently, they could easily carry over infectionfrom one individual to the next so that EB orchlamydial DNA is placed in or around the eye ofthe next child before the specimen is collected. Asimilar increased risk of contamination wouldfollow for anybody else, such as a clinical grader ora photographer, who had examined or handled thechild before specimens were collected. Studies haveshown an occasional positive swab that is just openand closed in the field (an \"air swab\") (217).Others have used duplicate swabs (218), butpositive PCR swabs have been reported from fieldstaff fingers, chairs and tables (219). Without being absolutely certain there is no chance of inadvertent contamination of thespecimen, the explanation of unusual results fromfieldwork is fraught with difficulty because of theconjunctivitis. Each study reported sensitivities ofthe order of 98.5% and specificities also in therange of The new technology alsopermitted the genotyping of chlamydia and the firstreport was also presented at this meeting (215). Linda Bobo and co-workers from Johns Hopkins used PCR based on the detection of the MOMPgene in a study in Tanzania and compared theirdata to DFA and the clinical status assessed withsimplified trachoma grading (216). Each of thePCR assays at this stage was in-house and theirdata are quite confusing. In humans who did nothave active trachoma, only 1% tested positive forDFA were positive for DFA, but 54%were positive for PCR testing. For TI, thepercentages were 60 and 95 respectively. Inhibitorswere subsequently identified in 75% of specimensthat were positive for DFA but negative for PCRtesting. These data were interpreted as indicatingthat PCR was more sensitive than clinical grading.Commenting on the finding of positive PCR resultsin humans who did not have TF, the authors said\"clinical grading is subject to error and it ispossible that less obvious clinical disease may havebeen present in these subjects\". As the WHOsimplified grading was used this is possible but thepossibility of specimen contamination duringcollection does not seem to have been considered. NAAT testing, specimen contamination and other issues In a clinic setting one patient is seen at a time, and usually the medical staff will have washed theirhands and possibly seen many patients between thecollection of one swab and the next. In a STDclinic, it is also very likely that examiners will begloved, and use at least a semi-sterile technique.However, trachoma fieldwork is conducted undervery different circumstances. With Giemsa cytology, there is almost no chance of having inadvertent contamination, as cells wouldhave to be carried over from one patient to another.It has been a long-standing practice to flame theplatinum spatula between cases or at least wipewith alcohol. Similarly, there is little likelihood ofcontamination of other cytology specimens such asDFA or with the collection of tears for serology.There is a theoretical risk of contamination ofchlamydial culture specimens but given theirrelatively low sensitivity, this issue does not seem tohave been raised or seriously explored. However, with modern PCR, it is a very different story. The importance of even minor specimencontamination is greatly changed with the ability todetect 100, 10 or possibly even one elementarybody\u2014dead or alive. The potential for specimencontamination is a particular problem for ocular Figure 4.9 DNA probe indicates the presence of chlamydia in a conjunctival smear. 78 TRACHOMA LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS 79 Figure 4.11 Specimen collection in the field TOP an eye with marked discharge and active trachoma (TF and TI) that could easily act as a source of specimen contamination CENTRE collecting a specimen for DFA.

Figure 4.10 A laboratory set-up LCR or PCR.TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:20 PM Page 78olds. There was almost no change with age with LCR positivity (infection); infection rates of 30%or higher were maintained in those over the age of10. The authors concluded that \"clinically activetrachoma is not always a reliable marker ofinfection.\" This could well have been rewritten as\"PCR positivity is not always a reliable marker ofclinically active trachoma.\" And the authors didnot consider the possibility of cross contaminationfrom one individual to another during specimencollection. The LCR test was later withdrawn fromthe market because of reproducibility problems(226). Further developments in PCR technology ledto the development of quantitative PCR that intheory allowed the quantification of the number ofcopies of the C. trachomatis omp1 gene in samples. Quantitative testing initially gave somewhat confusing data, with many people having low levelsof detectable organism irrespective of clinicalstatus, possibly due to low level contamination(168) (see Figure 4.12). The distribution of theselow levels varied from one site to another and maybe linked to the different field teams and protocolsfollowed. Nevertheless, there was a clear picture foryoung children and those with more severe diseaseto have higher levels of organism detected. Thiswas an exciting advance and added greatly to thearmamentarium available to study the amount ofchlamydia present or shed. These data confirmedthe findings from previous laborious studies whichhad used fluorescent cytology techniques (92).Quantitative PCR has also been useful formonitoring levels of infection after communityantibiotic treatment. NAAT testing of trachoma specimens used DNA assays of one sort or another, apart from one earlyreport that detected RNA (210). However in 2006,Burton and co-workers used a 16S TheRNA results were strongly correlated withincreasing disease severity but in general, there wasa relatively poor correlation between the DNA andRNA results. This suggested at least some of theDNA may have come from small numbers of non-viable chlamydia. In particular, of the 34 tests thathad less than 100 DNA copies per swab, only twotests were positive for RNA. Some have argued thispotential risk of artefact. It is the exquisitesensitivity of PCR techniques in detecting suchsmall trace amounts of DNA that makes this suchan important issue. Robin Bailey, then a student at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and co-workers compared an in-house PCR assay with anEIA (IDEIA) and clinical grading in The Gambia(220). The percentage of positive results with PCRwas higher than EIA in each severity of diseasecategory. Overall, they reported a sensitivity ofPCR to clinical grading of 72% with 93%specificity; the sensitivity of EIA was 62% with94% specificity. At the six month follow-up, themajority who had been clinical disease negative butPCR positive had not developed any clinical signs,although 17% developed TF, compared to only 8%of those who had been PCR negative at baselineand developed TF at six months. Across the full range of chlamydial infection, PCR is a much more sensitive test than previoustests with a sensitivity generally in the range of90% to 95% and a specificity of 99.5% (204). Thecommercially available system Amplicor (Roche)became widely used. Another commonly used testwas the Ligase Reaction (LCR, Abbott) inwhich the DNAstrands, an additional enzyme, polymerase wasused to close a gap of two nucleotides between twoincomplete ends of the ligated strands. The LCRtest was particularly favoured by the San Franciscogroup and used in most early azithromycin fieldstudies (221). A problem that arose in the assessment of NAAT tests was that they appeared to be much moresensitive than chlamydial culture. If chlamydialculture was used as the \"gold standard\", NAATtesting would identify positive specimens that werenegative on the \"gold standard\" test. This wouldshow a lack of specificity. There was muchdiscussion in the literature about the appropriategold standard and the need to stop using culture asthe standard. For example, while assessing an earlyDNA probe, Schacter and co-workers (135)\"defined a true positive as a child who yielded apositive tissue culture, a positive Giemsa specimenor a specimen that was positive in two of the otherthree non-culture methods.\" Using this newdefinition, they found the sensitivity of culture tobe of the order of 75% to 90% (204). Much has been written about the reliability of in-house NAAT assays for the detection ofchlamydia (222,223). Apfalter and co-workers alsogive a comprehensive review of the difficulties ofNAAT testing for chlamydia (222). They list fourmajor areas of error in specimen collection,although they overlook specimen contamination.Presumably this oversight is because the authorsdeal predominantly with STD patients in a clinicalsetting. They also list eight major sources oflaboratory error, four major sources for test designerror and two major areas for interpretation error. NAAT testing can also be affected by the presence of inhibitors (201). It is unclear whetherinhibitors may have played a role in the somewhatunusual LCR results published from Nepal in 1999(224). Although working in a relatively lowprevalence area, the prevalence of active trachomawas less than 6% and none of the LCR specimenswere positive. The interpretation of these resultswas that a \"low prevalence of clinically activetrachoma is not necessarily evidence of the presenceof chlamydial infection\". This suggests thattrachoma may occur as some unique event withoutthe need for chlamydia. Other experimentationmight include the possibility that the test did notwork for a variety of reasons. Amplification testsare susceptible to a number of inhibitors, many ofwhich are unknown, but some like phosphate havebeen identified (225). Manufacturers will provideadvice on further manipulation or \"confirmation\"tests to help resolve this issue. In addition, theremay have been misclassification in the clinicalgrading or chlamydia may have been presentintermittently to stimulate disease, but were notdetectable at the time of testing. The latter hasincreased relevance when one considers the cyclesof reinfection and the immunopathology oftrachoma where delayed-type hypersensitivity isthought to be important. One of the first trachoma studies to use LCR was the Azithromycin in the Control of Trachoma(ACT) in Egypt (221). Overall, 31% of those withactive trachoma (TF or TI) were positive with LCR,as were 31% who did not have active trachoma.The age-specific prevalence of clinical diseasedropped markedly with increasing age, from over60% in four year olds to less than 10% in 16 year 80 TRACHOMA Figure 4.12 Results of quantitative PCR showing estimated number of copies of omp1 gene per swab by age.

Alternatively, the low levels of organism detected by the DNA PCRcould reflect spurious contamination and could inreality be false positives. A second study used acommercially available 16S rRNA-based APTIMAC. trachomatis (ACT) assay (Gen-Probe) and compared it to DNA PCR (218). This study foundthat the RNA assay was more often positive andwas more sensitive than the DNA assay. Theyspeculated that rRNA is more abundant than DNAand may therefore contribute to increasedsensitivity. This issue cannot be resolved with thecurrent data and further studies comparing RNAand DNA testing will be of interest. Current status of NAAT testing Ribosomal RNA is of particular interest, as there issome debate as to whether 16S rRNA is present inelementary bodies, but we know that reticularbodies have about twice as many copies of rRNAas gene copies of DNA (228). This may makerRNA assays a better indicator of the presence ofactual chlamydial infection. Other studies haveshown that chlamydial DNA may persist for up toa week (204). In addition, residual killed EB maybe detected in the conjunctival scrapings up to aweek after ocular installation (229). Both PCR and LCR became widely used. They provided convenient and automated assessment ofa large number of specimens and did not require acool chain for specimens. For STDs they performedwell on non-invasive urine specimens and this wasa significant advance. Best of all, these tests werehighly sensitive. Their major downside was expenserelative to other tests available (230), althoughpooling specimens was widely recommended toreduce costs (225,231). Schachter has recently reviewed the current commercially available diagnostic kits (223). Hedismissed in-house assays (or \"home-brew\" tests)because of problems of targeting a 23S RNAsequence. GenPROBE also 16S RNA assayrecommended as a \"confirmation test\", APTIMACT (ACT). The second generation tests include atarget capture step that reduces their susceptibilityto inhibitors. The sensitivity of these assays is about 92% to 96%, and the specificity in excess of 99%.Specimen pooling for STD testing when theprevalence is less than 5% can reduce the cost oftesting by half. Schachter speculated that furtherimprovement in NAAT testing would come withimprovements in specimen processing, methods fornucleic acid extraction and the use of internationalstandards for quality control. This would in turnreduce the variation in test sensitivity. He previouslystated \"we are now approaching the level wherefalse positives are more likely due to labelling errorsand mistakes in specimen collection or processingthan problems with technology\" (225). Correlation of clinical grading and laboratory tests Despite modern, highly sensitive NAAT, many have reported a poor correlation between clinicalexamination and laboratory tests(196,232,233,234), particularly in areas with lowprevalence of trachoma. A study in The Gambiaidentified 7% of the population with infectionbased on PCR, but only a quarter of these PCRpositive individuals showed clinical signs oftrachoma (227). In Nepal, where 6% of childrenhad clinical trachoma, none had LCR evidence ofinfection (224). Similar reports with LCR testingalso came from China (235). Some have suggestedthat nucleic acid tests should replace clinicalgrading for control activities and antibioticdistribution (196,236,237). As detectable chlamydial infection rapidly declines after mass antibiotic treatment, it has beensuggested that a reliance on clinical examinationmight lead to unnecessary antibiotic treatment incommunities with clinically active trachoma, butwith no or low levels of demonstrable infection(196,205). Anthony Solomon, a young Australianinfectious disease doctor working in London, haswritten a useful review that includes the correlationof laboratory tests and clinical signs in which heconsiders factors that influence the accuracy of the82 TRACHOMA Figure 4.13 Prevalence of infection in active trachoma in children.

A good estimate of prevalence is deemed by many to be desirable, if not essential, formonitoring when one needs to establish baselineprevalence and then repeat prevalence surveysperiodically (240). The suggested criteria for thecertification of the elimination of blindingtrachoma is to mandate multiple prevalencesurveys. These surveys are seen as an essential partof the azithromycin donation program.Conceptually, large prevalence surveys are fairlystraightforward. They can keep a lot of people busyfor a long time, but often become an end inthemselves rather than the means to an end. Inprogrammatic activities, as distinct from researchactivities, careful consideration needs to be given towhether a detailed population-based prevalencesurvey is required, or whether some other samplingor indicator methodology can suffice. The WHO has published extensive guidelines on the methodology of prevalence surveys includingthe selection of random sampling and data analysis.The 2006 Trachoma Control, A Guide forManagers (127) is a useful update of many previous versions (102). There are many goodpublished examples of prevalence surveys(125,241,242,243,244,245). However, population-based prevalence surveys are relatively weak atdistinguishing between low level trachoma and itsabsence, unless they use a large sample size. This isparticularly important when a disease liketrachoma has a lumpy distribution and classicallyoccurs in pockets. The focal nature of trachomabecomes especially marked as prevalence levels fall. In an attempt to give some flexibility to programs in determining whether trachoma stillexists in certain areas and in making some firstorder assessments for prioritising intervention, theWHO developed the Trachoma Rapid AssessmentMethodology (TRA) (246). A further refinement ofthis has been suggested with the use of Lot QualityAssurance Sampling, a methodology developed formonitoring manufacturing processes. Thistechnique became known as Asymmetric SamplingTrachoma Rapid Assessment (ASTRA) (247). It isanother attempt to estimate the prevalence in thecommunity without a full population-based study. In 1997 at the start of the WHO program \"The Global Elimination of Trachoma by the Year 2020\"(GET 2020) (248), there were some 55 countrieslisted as being either known to have or thought tohave endemic trachoma. In some of these countriestrachoma had been a serious problem in the past,but no further data were available from the last 10or 20 years. In these countries, one had the optionof doing a population-based prevalence survey toascertain whether trachoma still existed anywhere LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS 85 test, the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and thosethat relate to the natural history of infection (196). The increasing sensitivity of laboratory tests is reflected in their ability to identify chlamydia inhigher proportions of individuals with activetrachoma (234). In areas hyperendemic fortrachoma (>20% prevalence), swabs taken fromchildren with active and 65% 4.13). The sensitivity of laboratory tests alsoincreases with the prevalence of clinical disease. Inthis case PCR was positive in 19% of children withactive in areas 20%prevalence) and 65% in hyperendemic regions(>20% prevalence). The intensity of the clinical disease is an important determinant of test sensitivity (see Figure4.14). Children with intense inflammation (TI), forexample, are more likely to have organismidentified from a swab than those with activetrachoma (TT) without TI (234). Quantitative PCRhas confirmed this finding by demonstrating higherlevels of organism in those with TI with or withoutTF than those with TF alone (122,168). Chlamydia can be identified in people who do not have signs of current active trachoma (seeFigure 4.15). However, the frequency with whichthis occurs is vastly different with PCR than withother tests, and the possibility of specimencontamination needs to be remembered. However,it is quite clear that a small percentage of peoplewho are not graded as having TF do havedemonstrable chlamydia. This is an instance where the WHO simplified grading system does not give enough discriminationand a finer clinical grading scale is required. Somehave used the 1981 WHO trachoma gradingsystem (238) and others have used customisedsystems for grading milder disease. In a study of1671 people in Tanzania, we subdivided follicularor active trachoma further into definitely normal,equivocal, definite but mild disease and TF or TI(239). Of the 47 who tested positive on culture orDFA and who did not have TF or TI, (\"normal\"),six (13%) were normal on fine grading, 15 (32%)had equivocal disease and 26 (55%) had a mildform of the disease. Thus only 1% who were trulyclinically normal tested positive on DFA. The sixwho were clinically normal included one girl andfive mothers, four of whom had children withactive trachoma in their families. Of equal importance are cases misdiagnosed as having trachoma when the clinical disease is relatedto another cause. These clinical \"false positives\" forfollicles could include other types of follicularconjunctivitis, or even the misdiagnosis of apapillary reaction and a severe allergic or vernalconjunctivitis. Some have suggested that infectionwith other organisms such as staphylococci maycause the re-expression conjunctivitis from a number of causes cancause the changes associated with correctlydiagnosed TI (extensive thickening) and manyfactors can cause the misdiagnosis of TI (the simpleobscuration of tarsal vessels). A more completediscussion of the differential diagnosis of trachomais discussed in the final section of the previouschapter. From this one concludes that chlamydia can be identified in the eyes of some people who areclinically normal at that time. Without closefollow-up, one cannot separate those who may beincubating an infection and will shortly producesigns. In human volunteer and monkey studies, theincubation period for clinical disease is usually fiveto 10 days. Alternatively, it may represent thetransient carriage of chlamydia in immune or non-immune people or possibly low levels of specimencontamination, although the latter is unlikelywithout NAAT tests. Whatever the ultimateexplanation, this seems to be a relatively rare event. Equally, it is clear that a large proportion of people with active trachoma, including some ofthose with intense inflammation (TI), do not havedemonstrable organism. As discussed in detail inchapter seven, this is a reflection of thepathogenesis of trachoma as an immune mediateddisease. Community assessment of trachoma The only way to establish the prevalence oftrachoma is to conduct a prevalence survey,although population-based prevalence surveys 84 TRACHOMA Figure 4.16 Examining villagers at a central site during apopulation-basedprevalence survey inthe Kongwa district ofTanzania (1986).TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:21 PM Page 84method has been used that selects a random sample of children using the method suggested for ASTRAbut does not apply the stopping rule (253). This is avariation of a population-based survey and gives atrue prevalence of trachoma in the age groupexamined. Many of these surveys have used a technique that randomly selects the starting household andsystematically moves to either the next closesthousehold or the next house in a given directionknown as the \"Random Walk\" (254). Thesesampling techniques are still susceptible to a certaindegree of subjectivity in the selection of households,particularly when village guides are used. The\"helpful\" village guides may bias the sample bysteering enumerating teams towards particularhouseholds (255). All these assessments of trachoma are based on clinical grading. Others have suggested thatlaboratory tests for the presence of chlamydiainfection use either NAAT tests, or the new dipstick could be used instead (205). Anothersuggestion was to use quantitative PCR to developa community ocular chlamydia trachomatous load(COCTL) (256). The use of these new laboratorytests to assess trachoma has not been fullyevaluated and begs the question of the relativeimportance of clinical and laboratory indicators oftrachoma, and which method is the better indicatorof the need for intervention to prevent the ultimatedevelopment of trachomatous blindness. Efforts to control trachoma are undertaken to prevent vision loss from trachoma or eliminatetrachomatous blindness (257). It is well establishedthat the development of trachoma blindness isstrongly correlated to the preceding presence andseverity of clinical disease. Active clinical diseasegenerally correlates with infection load, but thereare clear exceptions (122,168,258). Those withmore severe \"active trachoma\" are more likely totest positive for chlamydia, but it has not beenestablished that they have a higher infection load.The frequency of positive laboratory tests(prevalence of demonstrable organism) increasesmarkedly with more severe active disease, that is,TI compared to TF (234). However, the highestlevels of infection (the number of organisms shed)are usually seen in young children, whether this bedetermined by cytology or NAAT testing(92,122,168). Cost is another factor to consider in comparing clinical and laboratory diagnosis. Laboratory testswill always cost more than field examination. Thelogistic costs of putting a team into the field andidentifying a sample of children will be the samewhatever test was used, but once a team is in placeand the children identified, there are essentially noadditional costs for clinical examination. However,even if the total costs including labour were onlyone dollar per child, it would add a very significantcost to any large-scale assessment. LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS 87 in the country. This would have been an almostimpossible task that certainly would be expensiveand utilise valuable resources better spent onvarious specific health intervention programs.Alternatively, one could use a more targetedapproach by seeking out and visiting areas mostlikely to still have trachoma, and examine thechildren who were most at risk. If these childrendid not have trachoma, then it would be highlyunlikely that trachoma would exist elsewhere. The methodology for rapid assessment has also been set out in some detail (246), using a two phasetechnique to obtain \"optimally biased\" samples inthe \"worst places\" within communities mostlikely to have trachoma. At risk communities areselected within a region using available informationfrom past records of trachoma and current socio-economic and hygiene conditions. Within thesecommunities, the children from the families withthe poorest hygiene and highest risk are examined(see Figure 4.17). It is important to emphasise that TRA does not indicate a prevalence, although it is likely to set theupper bound of a possible prevalence, that is, if 10of the 50 children examined during TRA havetrachoma (20%), it is unlikely that the trueprevalence of trachoma would be any greater thanthis percentage. If the highest risk children weretruly examined, other children would be at lowerrisk and have a lower rate of trachoma, if they hadtrachoma at all. This could only reduce its overallprevalence. Thus TRA can indicate the presence oftrachoma and maximum prevalence, although itgives no lower bound of prevalence (249,250,251). The ASTRA assessment uses the trade-off of a rapid survey using a random sampling methodagainst a relative lack of precision in prevalenceestimates. It applies a \"stopping rule\" so thatexaminations continue until a predeterminednumber of children with trachoma have beenidentified. At that point, there is no need toexamine the rest of the sample as the trueprevalence will lie within preset bounds. Forexample, if the threshold is set at four of 50children with trachoma, there is no need to identifyor examine the remaining 46. With ASTRA onecan determine whether the true prevalence oftrachoma in a community lies within a rangedefined by a preselected upper and lowerprevalence boundary (247,252).

The name Chlamydozoa (\"cloak\" or \"mantle\", and \"animal\") was first proposed by Halberstaedter and von Prowazek to reflect the way elementary bodies appear to be cloakedwithin the intracellular inclusion (142). However, over the years, a number of other names were used. The similarity between the trachoma organism and organisms associated withpsittacosis and lymphogranuloma venereum led to the transient use of the terms Bedsonia,Miyagawanella, TRIC (T rachoma and Inclusion Conjunctivitis) agents and PLT (Psittacosis Lymphogranuloma and Trachoma) agents. For a while they were considered to beRicketssia (162). The most recent classification was proposed by Karin Everett and colleagues in 1999 from the National Animal Disease Center, US Department of Agriculture(259). This classification has not been universally adopted and, in fact, has generated muchdiscussion. Most workers in the field continued to use the term chlamydia for the twogenera, Chlamydia and Chlamydophila (5) (see Table 5.1). Chlamydiae are characterised by their unique development cycle with the extracellular infectious form (elementary body) and the intracellular replicative form (reticulate body).They are Gram-negative bacteria, but they are smaller than many viruses and were initiallyclassified as viruses because of their small size. They could pass through the Berkefeld V 89TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:21 PM Page 88animals raised for food production, decreasing growth rates, fertility and milk production. Australian marsupials are unique animals and have been geographically isolated from the rest ofthe world for millennia. It is interesting to note thatin these animals not only have C. pneumoniae and C. pecorum been identified, but multiple new strains are still to be classified (261). One study found C. psittaci present in 70% of koalas, with only 9% showing symptoms (262). Analysis of sequence changes in 16S rRNA provide a molecular clock which can be used tomonitor the early evolution of bacteria (5). (Seealso Figure 1.1). Chlamydia appear to have separated from the Parachlamydiaceae acanthamoeba some 350 to 830 million years ago. Chlamydia separated from Chlamydophila between the Cretaecous and Jurassic era 50 to 200 millionyears ago. C. suis diverged from the other Chlamydia 31 to 74 million years ago as the mammalian species started to differentiate and C. muridarum about 19 to 46 million years ago. Primates first appeared about 20 to 30 millionyears ago and Homo sapiens some 500,000 yearsago. LGV diverged from the other strains of C. trachomatis four to 13 million years ago and the genital and ocular strains were differentiated abouttwo to five million years ago. The trachoma biovardifferentiation started about 0.8 to 1.8 millionyears ago. Richard Stephens at the ProctorFoundation in San Francisco points out that thissuggests ocular infection occurred surprisingly earlyin human evolution. The chlamydial developmental cycle The unique developmental cycle of chlamydia wasfirst documented by Lindner by 1913 (147) . isolated the psittacosis agent in the 1930s itwas possible to study this developmental cycle inmore detail (263). The ability to culture chlamydia, especially in tissue culture, greatly facilitated thesestudies. The length of the chlamydial developmental cycle varies considerably with different species andstrains of chlamydia and host cells. T ypically in the laboratory, C. trachomatis will take 24 to 48 hours to complete a developmental cycle, although in in vivostudies C. trachomatis may take more than twice that long (264) (see Figure 5.1). The host response or the presence of interferon- in vitro may arrest development and lead to \"persistent\"infection (265). Much has been learnt about detailed mechanisms involved in the chlamydial lifecycle and these have recently been reviewed andsummarised by Hackstadt (266), Hatch (267) and Clarke (268). Chlamydia use \"parasite-specific\" phagocytosis (269) to initiate an active process of phagocytosis.BIOLOGY OF CHLAMYDIA 91 EB attachment and entry tohost cellInhibition of phagolysosmalfusionPrimary differentiationEB RB Limited growth and viable ChlamydiaFigure 5.1 Simple schematic representation of the C. trachomatis developmental cycle in vitro.

The EB is typically 0.2 to 0.6 in diameter, with an RB up to 1.5 . The RB divide by binary division and after consolidation toform new EB, the inclusion ruptures or is extrudedto release the infectious but metabolically inactiveEB. Members of Chlamydiaceae share afamily- or epitopeand (260). The twogenera Chlamydia and Chlamydophila differ in that the former produce glycogen and have tworibosomal operons whereas the latter do notproduce detectable glycogen and only have a singleribosome operon. The genus Chlamydia contains three species. C. trachomatis only naturally infects humans and the four ocular serovars A, B, Ba and C areuniversally responsible for blinding endemictrachoma. C. muridarum was originally called the mouse pneumonitis agent (MoPn) which onlyinfects mice. It was initially thought to be similar toC. trachomatis . Recently a second strain of C. muridarum has been identified in hamsters. C. suis is endemic in pigs where it causes conjunctivitis,enteritis and pneumonia. It has a number of diversestrains. The genus Chlamydophila is still often referred to as chlamydia. Many of these species wereformerly lumped together as strains of C. psittaci . C. pneumoniae, formerly known as TWAR, is an important cause of pneumonia in humans and hasalso been associated with arteriosclerosis, asthmaand even age-related macular degeneration. C. pneumoniae also causes infection in a wide range of animals and reptiles including koalas,snakes, iguanas, chameleons, frogs and turtles. TheDNA of C. pneumoniae is about 20% larger than that of C. trachomatis . C. psittaci is predominantly an avian infection. Although persistent inapparentinfection is very common, C. psittaci is associated with epidemics in birds and causes respiratoryinfection psittacosis in humans and contains at leastfive serovars. C. pecorum predominantly affects mammals including cattle, sheep, goats and pigs,and also koalas. C. abortus is common amongst ruminants but also occurs in horses, rabbits, guineapigs, mice, pigs and humans. Infection is frequentlyassociated with abortion. C. felis is endemic amongst cats and causes feline conjunctivitis,rhinitis and respiratory infection. Finally, C. caviae occurs in guinea pigs and was formerly known asguinea pig inclusion conjunctivitis. Chlamydial infection is highly prevalent in animals and as such, over 70% of domestic cattleand pigs and nearly 60% of feral pigs will be PCRpositive (260). Most calves are infected within two weeks of birth and the prevalence and intensity ofinfection increases exponentially with crowding.T welve per cent of cats carry C. felis . In many cases animal infection is endemic and asymptomatic,although as mentioned, epidemics of infection willoccur, particularly in birds, if the animals arestressed or crowded together. More typically, theasymptomatic infection makes the animal moresusceptible to other infections and less able to resistother pathogens. Chronic latent or persistentinfection may also have important implications in90 TRACHOMA Table Genital \"up regulated\" during the development cycle (270) (see Figure 5.4). Twenty-nine genes are up regulated within the first hour and have been called \"immediate early genes\". By mid cycle (eight to 16hours) nearly all genes are expressed and 26 genesare expressed late in development (24 to 40 hours).Nicholson has grouped these genes into seventemporally cohesive clusters (271). Much is still tobe learnt about the fine control of thesemechanisms, but a picture is now emerging of theways in which chlamydia control gene expressionand use sigma factors to regulate the transcriptionof specific genes. The sequencing of C. trachomatis serovar D by Rick Stephens of San Francisco was a majorachievement (272). Since then, the complete sequences of C. trachomatis serovar A, C. muridarum, two isolates of C. pneumoniae, C. caviae, C. abortus and C. felis have become available (273). The chlamydial genome is small with approximately 1.04Mbp and codes for 894proteins (272). Some 28% of these proteins are unique to chlamydia. There is a strong \"coregenome\" of conserved genes that are commonamongst all chlamydia, but there is also an area ofgreater variability near the replication terminuslabelled the and the gene.

Multipleattachment mechanisms have been identified andthey may be used by different species with differentcell lines or under different conditions. Initially, areversible electrostatic adhesion is noted. Thisseems to be mediated by glycosaminoglycans,although it is unclear whether these arechlamydially derived or originate from the host cell.An irreversible attachment develops. The role ofType III Secretion (TTS) and tyrosinephosphorylation of Tarp is not yet known,although these mechanisms are activated. Inaddition, plasma membrane proteins (PMPs) mayalso be important. Changes are noted in actinfilaments within the cells and a number of GTPasesare activated along with cascades of other enzymes. Once inside the cell, the chlamydia replicate in a unique niche, the intra-cellular vacuole. There are avariety of mechanisms that are still not clearlyelucidated by which the vacuole containingchlamydia is able to avoid or delay liposomalfusion, and still interact with host cell microtubulesand metabolic processes. Chlamydia is dependenton the host cell ATPase, energy generation and alsolipids, such as sphingomyelin and cholesterol.Chlamydia release recently identified inclusion-modifying proteins (Incs) that modulate host cellresponse in unknown ways. Elementary bodies have a number of surface exposed proteins. The major outer membraneprotein (MOMP) is the predominant protein,which is also immuno-dominant. It has fourvariable domains and domain variation providesthe serotying classification ofC. trachomatis . MOMP is a porin with a molecular weight of 39 kDa. Other surface proteins includethe PMPs of which there are between nine to 20species. They are autotransporters and cleaved onthe surface to give a final molecular weight ofabout 70 kDa. PMPs are also thought to beimportant in attachment and may form a target forfuture vaccine development. The surface alsocontains chlamydial lipopolysaccharide.Unexplained hemispherical domes can also be seenon the of EB by electron microscopy. Elementary bodies are characterised by their small size, about 0.5 , compared to the RB of about 1.5 (see Figures 5.2, 5.3). The compact shape of the EB seems to be maintained bydisulphide bonds that tightly crosslink the surfaceproteins and compress the EB, almost like a tightnet. The chlamydia DNA is also tightly packed andhistone-like proteins prevent transcription and holdthe DNA tightly together. Once the EB has enteredan intracellular vacuole, the disulphide bonds breakand EB expands again to form RB. The histone-likeproteins are removed and their production isstopped. The chlamydia becomes metabolicallyactive and transcription starts within 30 minutes ofentering the cell. Some beautiful studies have been undertaken with micro arrays to identify chlamydial genes that 92 TRACHOMA Figure 5.2 Transmission electron micrograph of an inclusion showing LEFT reticular bodies and RIGHT elementary bodies. Figure 5.3 Scanning electron micrograph of an inclusion showing reticular bodies and elementary bodies,(courtesy, Michael Ward).TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:21 PM Page 92previously identified from studies of the ompA gene alone. The significance of these findings is yet to beestablished. The toxin expressed by somechlamydia ( C. muridarum, C. caviae and C. pecorum ) is similar to the large clostridial cytotoxins that block the GTPases activated byinterferon- (266). In addition to their own DNA, all chlamydia contain four to eight copies of a highly conservedplasmid whose function is unknown (268). Theplasmid, known as a chlamydiaphage, is 7.5 Kband features eight major open reading frames (seeFigure 5.5). Many chlamydia are also infected witha bacteriophage. These microviridae constitute thesmallest known DNA virus (22nm). Six differentbut related phages have been identified. Theycontain a single strand circular DNA of 4.5 Kbpwith eight open reading frames. The function of thephages is also unknown.

More detailed studies of the ompA gene have shown diversity within a given serovar. A study inEgypt showed five variations of genovar A and sixvariations in genovar Ba, but only a single genovarfor serovar C (274) (see Table 5.2 ). The over- whelming majority of isolates had the commongenetic sequence, but a small number of isolateshad one or two point mutations in either variablesegment 1 or 2 of the ompA gene. These minorgenovar variations could be used to trackhousehold clustering and were also used to monitorthe re-emergence of infection after treatment.Another study in Nepal had similar findings, butthree genotypes of Ba and six genotypes of C werefound (275). Again the vast majority shared acommon genotype with small numbers of isolateswith single point mutations. Another study examined multiple loci dispersed through the chromosome to determine theoccurrence of recombination amongst 19laboratory reference strains of chlamydia and 10recent isolates (276). They found thatrecombination was widespread, although pointsubstitution was relatively infrequent. Hot spots forrecombination were identified downstream fromthe ompA gene. These findings suggest there maybe more divergent clones of chlamydia than 94 TRACHOMA Table 5.2: Location and encoding outcomes of point mutations distinguishing genovars from the prototype A, Ba and C sequences (274) Genovar A56 (VS1)93125256 (VS2) A1 (138) CA A2 (7) None GA A3 (3) C T Gly Ser A4 (4) Ala Val A5 (1) Ser Ba2 (9) AG Ser'Gly Ba3 (2) AGG TC A Ser'Gly Ala Ser ProHis Ba4 (1) AGA GG T ThrAla Ser Gly Ala Ser Ba5 (2) AGC T SerGly ProLeu Ba6 (1) CTA GG T Ala Val Ser Gly Ala Ser Genovar C 56 (VS1)165 C1 (25) TCC T IleThr None Numbers in parentheses indicate genovar frequency and VS indicates variable sequence.

So trachoma is a disease of the home, especially when the home is also the cr\u00e8che FRED HOLLOWS , 1989 TRACHOMA IS A disease of the cr\u00e8che and clusters in large or small pockets. These pockets may be countries (currently 54 of 200), districts or regions, villages or household clusters within villages, but ultimately trachoma is a disease of individual families.Epidemiology can describe where trachoma occurs but more importantly, why some areaffected and others not. It can also explain the patchiness of these pockets of infection andthe basis of family clustering. Although there was much confusion in the 19th century about definitions of trachoma (its cause, its course and complications), by the 1900s, the clustering of trachoma within thefamily was well known and described. Boldt firmly stated \"The chief seat of infection is thefamily, especially the poor with their small dwellings\" (15). Thygeson later said \"Sincetrachoma is known to spread chiefly in the home, the characteristics of the homeenvironment are important ... One can almost pick out on sight the homes where trachomawill be found rampant\" (69). Similar observations came from Kentucky (75), Indianreservations in the USA (76) and Egypt (26) (see Figure 6.1). There are copious reports from around the world confirming family clustering of trachoma. These include studies from the USA (77), Japan (83), Tunisia (277), Jordan (278),Saudi Arabia (92), Iran (279), Egypt (280), Samoa (281), South Africa (282), Tanzania(241,283), The Gambia (284) and Brazil (285). About the only study to specifically look forfamily clustering and not find any evidence was undertaken at a time in Taiwan whentrachoma was rapidly disappearing (286). That study found marked regional variation andclustering by socioeconomic stratification, although many families had just a single personTRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:21 PM Page 96with residual disease. However, other studies in Taiwan did show family transmission (287,288).Our study in Mexico found family clustering in onevillage with a lower prevalence of trachoma, butnot in the other village with a higher prevalence,where most families were affected (110)(see Figure 6.2). Many of these studies, particularly the earlier ones, were not very detailed; they used theMacCallan Classification and often used onlyrudimentary analytic techniques. Other studieshave looked more specifically at the particularfactors within the family that are associated withthe family clustering of trachoma. Carl Taylor (later Head of International Health at Johns Hopkins) and his colleagues in the Punjabin India undertook one of the first trachoma studiesthat used the tools of \"modern epidemiology\"(289). They found the principal place of infectionwas in the home, and if the mother was affected\u2014irrespective of the status of the father\u2014the childrenwere at higher risk. Taylor described the possibilityof both the direct transfer of infection and indirectcontact with \"reciprocating infection\" betweenmothers and children, through the use of themother's dopatta (or shawl) to wipe children's eyesand faces and the use of suoormi (a Kohl-likesubstance placed around the eyes). He believed thatchildren who suffered a relapse after being treatedat school would have been almost certainlyreinfected at home. In the Samoan Islands, Ostler attributed the family clustering of trachoma to the custom offamilies eating together and sharing a commonbowl, and to using a comm on towel to wash their hands and faces before and after meals (281). Thiswas culturally important and meals were eaten byhand. Nichols and the group from Harvard studied the intrafamily spread of trachoma infection in SaudiArabia and concluded the \"reservoir infection liessomewhere in the household Their extensive cytology studies usedquantitative fluorescent antibody cytology andshowed the vast bulk of infection was in childrenunder five years of age (see Figure 6.3). They alsodemonstrated that a child was much more likely tohave trachoma if they had one or more siblingswith active trachoma. Similar findings werereported from Lebanon (291) and have beenrediscovered in more recent studies. Bailey and colleagues from London showed trachoma clustered in family compounds in TheGambia and furthermore, it clustered by bedroom(292). They postulated that trachoma spread wasfacilitated by prolonged intimate contact in thebedroom. This concept was consistent with thenotion of ocular promiscuity and the sharing andswapping of ocular secretions put forward byBarrie Jones (see below) (91). Bailey could find noother explanation for the spatial clustering andthere was no direct link with water supply (284). Further analysis from The Gambia showed that children who shared a bedroom with an active casehad a twofold risk increase of having trachoma(293). As the number of children with activetrachoma in a bedroom increased, there was also atrend for an increased risk of more severe activedisease. A more sophisticated study used ageographical information system (GIS) to mapvillages in The Gambia. It also confirmedsignificant clustering of trachoma in bedroomsafter adjusting the study for age, room size anddistance to water (283). A detailed study we undertook in Malawi quantified the very strong clustering of trachoma(294) (see Figure 6.4). This statistical analysiscompared the clustering of trachoma andxerophthalmia. Trachoma was found to be stronglyclustered in villages and even more so in families.For children, there was a 12-fold clustering effectfor trachoma. When one child was found to havetrachoma, it was more likely that other children inthe same family would have trachoma too. This hasimportant consequences for sample size estimatesfor trachoma prevalence surveys that would need tobe increased ninefold. A recent report from Senegalassessed this design effect to be about sixfold (253). Our large population-based study in Tanzania of 8409 also demonstrated strong family clusteringapparent even with controls for distance to water,religion and facial cleanliness (295) (see Figure 6.5).Similar findings came from a smaller study in Egyptof 1107, where both hygiene and crowding withinthe family were considered to be importantdeterminants for family clustering (280). Inaddition, pre-schoolchildren had a significantincreased risk if they had either another sibling of THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF TRACHOMA AND REINFECTION 99 Figure 6.1 American Indian home in 1915. \"It provides a splendid place for trachoma...\" reads the caption in Berry GL.

A further analysis showed the risk of an individual havinginfection demonstrated by PCR at two months wasrelated to their own status at baseline. Thoseinfected at baseline were more likely to be stillinfected at two months. The risk of infection at sixmonths was related to the presence of otherinfected individuals in their household (299). By 12months, households with recrudescent infectionclustered within 1.2 kilometres. This analysissuggested infection finally may spread betweenhouseholds with children, and that nearbyhouseholds will also share the same risk factors.Nearby houses are often interlinked by family ties,and there was a high level of interchange ofinfection between extended family members (283).To my mind, these observations firmly establish thenotion that trachoma is a family-based disease andtransmission occurs within this living unit.The age of first infection Active trachoma is a disease of early childhood, oras Fred Hollows succinctly put child-care group.However, information exists about thedynamics and acquisition of chlamydial infectionand the development of clinical trachoma in thefirst years of life. Very young children are often difficult to examine (see Figure 6.6). They are small, not co-operative and physically hard to hold. Trying toevert the eyelid of a crying infant is distressing toeverybody, especially the mother, and othermothers quickly become reluctant to have theiryoung children examined. For these reasons, manytrachoma studies have not examined children underthe age of one, in fact, some studies even confinethemselves inappropriately to schoolchildren. Rowland Wilson (who became Director of the Giza Laboratory after MacCallan's retirement)studied 40 newborn Egyptian children (300).Giemsa cytology was collected every two weeksand all developed inclusions within the first fewmonths of life. The number of inclusions decreasedrapidly after the first three months from their firstappearance. Sowa and co-workers studied the age of acquisition of trachoma in The Gambia (301).They followed 79 newborn children, five of whomdeveloped chlamydial conjunctivitis in the firstthree weeks of life. This was presumed to begenitally-acquired ophthalmia neonatorum,although two mothers also had active trachomawith positive chlamydial cultures. Twobabies resolved the infection without sequelae. Twoof the babies were twins; one of the twins and twoof the other three babies had ongoing chlamydialinfection and developed signs consistent withtrachoma including pannus. It is unclear if thosewith ongoing disease had persistence of their initialinfection or whether they were exposed to furtherinfection within their family environment. Thediscordance of disease in the twins was notdiscussed further. Eleven of the remaining 74 babiesalso acquired chlamydial infection with positiveocular cultures and signs consistent with trachoma,starting from three months. By three or fourmonths, the immune system is sufficiently matureTHE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF TRACHOMA AND REINFECTION 101 similar age, or an older sibling with trachoma.However, the Egyptian data suggested thattrachoma was transmitted between youngerchildren rather than from school-age youths totheir younger siblings. This notion was stronglysupported by earlier reports from Tunisia, Algeriaand Japan (46). Several studies have used serotyping of chlamydia to study family clustering. Those fromSaudi Arabia were amongst the first studies toshow the consistency of serovar specificity ofserologic response of family members (177).Similar findings came from Taiwan (288) andserotyping of isolates in southern Iran over fiveyears \"clearly confirms transmission on aninterpersonal basis mainly within the confines ofthe family\" (279,296). Studies in Tanzania showedstable serovar specificity of tear antibodies over a12 month longitudinal study of nine families (297).The use of PCR technology to look at geneticvariation in chlamydia in The Gambia alsoconfirmed strong household clustering (220), as didthe Tanzanian studies (124). As technology has developed, so has the sophistication of various studies. Genovar studies,for example, show frequent single point mutationsin the variable segments (VS1 and VS2) of MOMP,and this allows the \"finger printing\" of individualstrains of chlamydia. In Egypt, relatively raregenovars are confined to a single family andrecurrent infection after treatment is usually fromthe genovar prior to treatment (274). (See alsochapter five, Table 5.2). At the same time, it wasnot uncommon to find mixed infections with twogenovars present in the same family. Similar studiesin Nepal show that even though half the sampleswere of a single genovar, the number of genovarvariants increases as prevalence increases;presumably as more families are involved, morewill have their own genovar (275). Studies of the re-emergence of chlamydial infection after community-wide treatment withazithromycin strongly support intra-family spread.Baseline analysis showed strong householdclustering after controlling for other known riskfactors (298). After azithromycin treatment, therisk of new infection in a household member wasincreased 3.5 times if another member of the familywas also PCR positive. The occurrence of newinfection was not related to travel outside the Figure 6.6 Examining small children can be quite difficult. Note the nasal discharge, scabies and the flies around the face in this Tanzanian baby (1986).

This debate has been furtherfuelled by the apparent similarity of the chlamydiathat cause such different ocular outcomes intrachoma and inclusion conjunctivitis. Initially,most authors assumed that trachoma was a chronicdisease that resulted from a single chronic infection;once acquired, trachoma would progressrelentlessly like syphilis, tuberculosis or leprosy(148). This assumption was explicit in theMacCallan grading and it was based on theunderstanding of the evolution of other chronicinfectious diseases. Observations from the field suggest reinfection was in conflict with the notion of ongoing chronicinfection. These inconsistencies were frequentlyseen, but were glossed over or somehow tuckedinto the general theory of chronic persisting disease.At present, this issue is still unresolved and it ispossible that both mechanisms may operate tosome extent. However, I believe that most of thefeatures of the disease including its epidemiologyand pathogenesis can be explained by the notion ofrepeated episodes of reinfection. Further field observations suggesting reinfection include the rapid recurrence of active trachoma inIndian children, who had been treated at schoolwith topical tetracycline in some of the earlytreatment studies (289). This was attributed toreinfection at home. Trachoma was seen to become\"periodic\" in Taiwan, where living conditions weredramatically improving (312). First grade childrenshowed \"conversions\" from active disease withdemonstrable organism to apparently normalconjunctiva without organism, and then theybecame reinfected and had active trachoma again.This could occur three or four times over a periodof five years. Similar observations that trachomawas a disease that \"waxes and wanes\" were madein Saudi Arabia (92). Nichols observed that \"theduration of infection is thought to be primarilydetermined by the living conditions of the subject\".The occurrence of disabling sequelae wasdetermined by the duration of infection rather thanclimate, geography, race, virulence or susceptibilityto the \"force of infection\", a term introduced byAssaad (94). Barrie Jones in London promoted the concept ofocular promiscuity ( pro in favour of; miscere to mix) (91). He related the duration and severity oftrachoma to both the magnitude of the source ofshedding of infection and the level of ocularpromiscuity within a family, that is, the interactionof the individual with the family \"pool ofinfection\". Suggestions that trachoma was not a simple chronic infection also came from a study of Indiansin the Punjab and those who migrated to BritishColumbia (313,314). Those who migrated toCanada as adults had as high rates of trachomasequelae (scarring and trichiasis) as those who hadlived all their life in the Punjab. However, ifindividuals had migrated to Canada before the ageof 20, they had less disease and were less likely tohave severe complications. The chance of \"relapse\"in British Columbia was assessed to be very small,the prevalence of trachoma was reduced, thedisease was less \"active\" and milder and did notspread to young children. The authors pointed outthat as the children in Canada were not affectedthere was little chance of infection or reinfectionoccurring within these families after migration.This meant the only way the disease could progressin the migrant adults would be through\"endogenous relapse\". However, as the adultsshowed little progression, the authors concludedthat endogenous relapse was not occurring andtherefore did not play an important role in thedisease. This formalised the observation previouslymade anecdotally many times in areas wheretrachoma has disappeared. Probably Tom Grayston (1924-) in Seattle was one of the first to advocate the importance ofreinfection (287,288,315,316). A leader inchlamydial research for 50 years, Grayston startedwork on trachoma in Taiwan before moving toSeattle, where he later became Dean of PublicHealth. He has made many major contributions tothe field and is a friend and mentor to many.Grayston's evidence for reinfection came from twoareas. First, his experimental infections in monkeysshowed that a single primary inoculation withchlamydia would eventually resolve the infectionwithout cicatricial sequelae. However, withsecondary infection, or challenge infection ofpreviously immunised animals, a proportion (about12%) developed more severe disease with pannusor scarring. He concluded that the cicatricial THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF TRACHOMA AND REINFECTION 103 to be able to form follicles and germinal centres, sotrachoma can be clinically distinguished fromconjunctivitis. Detailed studies in Saudi Arabia show the bulk of chlamydial infection occurred in children underfive years, and infants between three to ninemonths shed the highest number of organisms(demonstrated by fluorescence cytology) (290).This was a striking finding as the prevalence ofinfection occurred well before the peak of clinicalinfection at 30 to 36 months. Clinical trachoma hasbeen commonly reported in children about fourmonths (123,162,300,302,303,304,305,306,307).In Egypt and Morocco almost all children werereported to have clinical signs within the first fewmonths of life (139,300). In the Sudan, 48% of children under the age of one year had already acquired trachoma with apeak prevalence of 71% in those aged one to fouryears (308). In Egypt, the highest age-specific rateof active trachoma was found in children under theage of one who had the most intense disease (304).Recent data from southern Sudan continue toconfirm the high prevalence of active trachoma inthe first two or three years of life (254). In fact, inthis hyperendemic area 56% of infants betweentwo weeks and 11 months showed signs of activetrachoma. Schachter and Dawson followed 88 infants from birth for one year and infection was defined bycytology and tear antibodies. They calculated theincidence of infection in the first year to be 6% permonth (309). These children form a huge pool ofinfection and the need to call on a genital reservoirof infection in their words was \"moot\". Whentrachoma was still endemic in Japan an incidenceof clinical disease in infants of 2.1% per month wasreported and 26% had trachoma by their firstbirthday (83). The difference between these twostudies may reflect real differences in the force ofinfection and transmission potential between hyperand mesoendemic areas, or they may reflectdifferences in ascertainment. There are multiple reports in the literature describing the age-specific rates of trachoma.Earlier studies that used the MacCallanClassification tend to be confusing because theprogression from one stage to another does notcorrelate with current concepts of disease, andactive trachoma can exist in the first threeMacCallan stages. The data become even moreconfusing when various composite indices ofgravity and severity were used, as they bear almostno relation to our current understanding of thedisease (286). The simplified grading givesprobably the clearest indication of the communitydistribution of trachoma (121). Studies show that peak prevalence of active trachoma is almost invariably in children, usuallyaged between two to five depending on the overalllevel of endemicity, and show a rapid decline in theprevalence of active trachoma after seven to 10years (see Figure 6.7). Interestingly, studies in Australian Aborigines also show a maximum age-specific infection in pre-schoolchildren, but there are also considerable ratesof active trachoma into the teenage years(103,310,311). The infectious pool Probably the single, biggest unresolved questionwith trachoma is the relative importance ofepisodes of reinfection versus the presence ofpersistent or latent infection. This issue has beenintensely debated for the last 100 years, ever since102 TRACHOMA Figure 6.7 Age-specific prevalence of trachoma in Australian Aborigines 1976-78 (NTEHP 1980 (103); courtesy, Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists). TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:58 PM Page 102sequelae were only seen with reinfection. His second line of evidence came from his family-basedstudies. These studies were hampered as trachomawas disappearing with rapid socioeconomicdevelopment in Taiwan. However, he undertookdetailed, longitudinal studies of families that usedtear and serum serology, chlamydial culture andclinical grading. They recoveryfrom infection in children, followed by relapse orreinfection. As in the animal studies, reinfection inchildren was associated with a more severeresponse and the development of cicatricialchanges, whereas initial or primary infection couldbe resolved without sequelae (178,316). As early as1963, Grayston clearly emphatically statedthat inclusion conjunctivitis was seen with singleocular chlamydial infection and that trachomaoccurred with repeated infection (315). An interesting discussion is recorded during the fourth International Chlamydial Meeting thatassessed the status on this debate in 1976 (317).Roger Nichols was one of those who spoke of theimportance of persisting infection and stressed thata small number developed long-term severe diseaseapparently from a single infection. Others includingGrayston, Dawson and Jones spoke of theimportance of reinfection. Dawson explained thedecrease in active infection in children after the ageof six as being due to \"increasing social distanceand better hygiene\", both of which would decreasethe likelihood of reinfection. The importance of reinfection While this meeting was going on, I was having myfirst experience of trachoma fieldwork with theNational Trachoma and Eye Health Program(NTEHP) in Australia, and was totally oblivious tothese erudite discussions. A year or so later at theWilmer Institute, the possibility of establishing ananimal model of trachoma was raised in discussionwith Art Silverstein, one of the first immunologiststo work full-time on ophthalmic issues, who had avery enquiring mind. My own field experience convinced me of the importance of reinfection for three reasons. Thefirst came to me in the first few months oftrachoma fieldwork. I had examined manyhundreds of Aboriginal children and a hundred orso European children living in the samecommunities and was struck by the different ratesof trachoma. Whereas trachoma prevalence inAboriginal children ranged between 40% to 70%,in those few non-Aboriginals it was only about1%. All lived in the same communities, shared thesame desks at school, played football together andshared the same flies. However, they went home todifferent families where they had vastly differentstandards of personal and family hygiene (seeFigure 6.8). This illustrates the importance of closeor continuous exposure to infection within thefamily. Much later, I learnt of similar observationspreviously made in different areas in North Africa (46). The second observation was the vastly different levels of personal and community hygiene one sawin trachoma areas. Thygeson had noted that youcould usually recognise people and families withtrachoma from a distance (69). Poor hygiene,copious ocular discharge and dirty faces gaveample opportunity for the sharing of ocularsecretions by ocular promiscuity, as Jones hadsuggested (91) (see Figure 6.9). Frequent exposureto infected ocular secretions could occur easily andoften with the poor hygiene present in thesetrachoma areas. The third observation was that none of our field staff developed trachoma or even inclusionconjunctivitis (318). Although we did not wash ourhands between every child we examined, the fieldteams did practise reasonable levels of personalhygiene in the clinic and during field activities (seeFigure 6.10). This suggested that chlamydia wasnot \"highly contagious\" and one needed fairlyclose contact to pick up infection. Jones related theclose interpersonal contact needed to exchangeocular chlamydial infection to that required for theexchange of genital tract infection and coined theterm \"ocular promiscuity\" (91). In my na\u00efvety, I replied to Silverstein that it would be easy to establish an animal model oftrachoma, and that all one needed to do was torepeatedly reinfect the animals. I had no knowledgeof previous controversies and the many \"failed\"monkey experiments. As detailed in the followingchapter, we were able to induce chronic diseaseresembling trachoma in monkeys with repeatedreinoculation. The monkey experiments reinforcedthe importance of repeated reinfection and my 104 TRACHOMA ABOVE Figure 6.9 A group of Australian Aboriginal children with a high prevalence of active trachoma. Many also show nasaldischarge and dirty faces (1977). RIGHT Figure 6.10 NTEHP field examinations in a schoolroom in CentralAustralia (1976).LEFT Figure 6.8 The strikingly TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:58 PM Page 104subsequent field studies were built on this premise. The next step was to return to the field to look at factors that favoured frequent transmission and episodes of reinfection. The first attempt was astudy of face washing we undertook in Mexico.This line of research led to further epidemiologicstudies into facial cleanliness in Tanzania, Malawiand elsewhere, the clinical trial of facial cleanlinessin Tanzania and the inclusion of facial cleanlinessas a component of the SAFE Strategy. Reinfection or persistence With all this information, one can make a veryconvincing argument about the importance ofrepeated episodes of reinfection. However, there aresome anomalies and outlying observations that donot entirely fit with this concept and these could beexplained by the occurrence of persistent infection. To properly evaluate \"anomalous\" results suggestive of persistent infection, one must ensurethat the possibility of repeated episodes ofreinfection are either totally excluded, or have beenmeasured and quantified. Without knowing thestatus of exposure to further infection, one cannotinterpret the finding of apparent presence ofongoing or persistent infection. One also has to beconfident of the validity of both the assessment ofclinical status and the detection of infection. Amore comprehensive clinical assessment is neededthan the WHO simplified grading system. Thereare always issues of test sensitivity and specificity,and with the supreme sensitivity of modern tests,the possibility of specimen contamination needs tobe confidently excluded. The occasional occurrence of individuals with apparent persistent severe infection needs moreunderstanding. Mabey found in The Gambia that achild with moderate severe disease at one visit was15 times more likely to have moderate or severedisease at the next visit, some eight or 13 monthslater (293). He observed that \"host factors may bemore important determinants of severity than thefrequency of episodes of reinfection\". This led to aseries of studies that suggested that majorhistocompatibility antigens may explain adifference in the immune response in someindividuals, and subsequent work has shownindividual variations in inflammatory mediatorsthat modify the risk of infection or sequelae(319,320). Longitudinal studies in Tanzania also have identified children with apparent persistent severeinfection. One such study of families we performedused culture, DFA and EIA and showed that youngage was a more important indication of thelikelihood of severe persistent disease three monthslater, rather than high inclusion counts on DFA andhigh antigen loads determined by EIA (297). Inanother study, we looked at environmental factorsthat may facilitate reinfection and the maintenanceof constant severe disease in three of fourexaminations over a 12 month period (321) . Thechildren with severe persistent TI were almost threetimes as likely to have a sibling with TF; twice aslikely to have a dirty face, live in a house more thantwo hours from water, or keep cattle nearby. Thestudy was confined to children aged one to seven,but girls were more likely to have persistent diseasein this age range than boys. West extended these observations and showed that children who had constant severe diseaseincurred a five times increased risk of developingconjunctival scarring at the seven-year follow-up,and were also more likely to still have intensiveinflammation at the seven-year examination (322).She also speculates that in addition to the roleplayed by reinfection, there might also be asubgroup of children who responded more stronglyto exposure to chlamydia, and developed moresevere diseases that they were unable to resolve.These children therefore would be at higher risk ofscarring. West noted that about 10% of childrenshowed constant severe inflammation over a 12month period, and the seven-year incidence ofscarring (TS) was 11%. 28%. The remaining 72% of TS would comefrom children who were not in the group withconstant severe disease. This is an importantobservation to keep in mind when assessing therelative importance of these mechanisms andindications for continuing programmaticinterventions. Another study from Tanzania examined a group of women who had positive PCR in twoexaminations three years apart; 73% were infectedwith the same genovar (323). Given half thesewomen were not living in households with 106 TRACHOMA children, this was taken as evidence for \"persistence of infection\". Those with persistent infection weremore likely to have scarring and trichiasis.However, none of these studies were able toquantify the ongoing exposure to chlamydia andtransmission. The source of infection What is the source of chlamydial infection that getsrecycled? Reinhards strongly stated that childrenbelow the age of four are the prime source forinfection within the family (324). Not only did theyhave the highest prevalence of trachoma andbacterial conjunctivitis, they also have the mostsevere disease and attract the most flies to theirface. The more sophisticated quantitativelaboratory studies, especially those using NAAT Figure 6.12 Nasal discharge can be an important source of chlamydial infection.THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF TRACHOMA AND REINFECTION 107 Figure 6.11 Distribution of chlamydial load in the total population by age and gender in Central Tanzania (West et al 2005 (122). Reprinted with permission from the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, \u00a9 2005).TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:59 PM Page 106presence of trachoma, both clinically and by PCR. West examined the effect of topical tetracyclinetreatment and concluded that nasal infection wasnot the source of ocular reinfection followingtopical treatment. further study usingquantitative PCR showed nasal carriage was higherin children with higher ocular loads or with TI(327). More recently, Gower has shown that nasaldischarge tested positive for chlamydia by PCR inone-third of Tanzanian children with trachomawho have nasal discharge, and this stronglycorrelates with a positive ocular PCR test (328).The presence of a positive nasal discharge wasmore likely in those with TI, and increased thelikelihood of the presence of infection two monthsafter treatment. Of course, chlamydia-infectednasal discharge could easily transfer infection fromone child to another by direct contact or viahandkerchiefs, sheets or other means. Chlamydial genital tract infection in adults has not been studied frequently in trachoma endemicareas. Some early studies in The Gambia (301) andSouth Africa (282) found it occurred relativelyinfrequently. More recent studies in Somalia usingEIA antigen tests demonstrated chlamydia in 6% of men, but 18% of women (329). Brunham andcolleagues examined families with trachoma inCentral Kenya (330). Although a range of serotypeswere cultured from the eyes of children (serovars A,A/L 2, B, Ba, D, E and F) only 4% of their mothers had positive cervical cultures and these were agenital strain (serovar E). It is worth re-emphasising the potential importance of children in the first year of life as asource of infection in their families, especially whenconsidering the efficacy of family or community-based distribution of azithromycin or otherantibiotic treatment. These young children mayhave very high infectious loads. Most treatmentprograms have only treated children aged one yearor more and in some cases, six months or more.This leaves this most potent reservoir of infection inthe family untreated with the youngest childrenbeing the family-based, infantile fountains ofinfection. The few existing studies suggest thatthese infants alone may account for 25% or even50% of the entire infectious load or pool ofinfection in the community!Trachoma in women It has become widely recognised that in generalwomen are particularly affected by trachoma.There are several good logistic and political reasonsto continue to emphasise this ongoing trend. Thepotential linkage of trachoma control activitieswith maternal and child health programs offersgreat advantages, as does the alignment with goalsto improve health, literacy and social standing ofwomen specifically re-enunciated in the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. The recognition that womenare disproportionately subject to trachoma isimplicit in the aphorism that trachoma is a diseaseof the cr\u00e8che, based on observations that in manyareas women have a significantly higher rate ofscarring and trichiasis than men (see Figure 6.13). Schereschewsky reported American Indian women were more affected than men (76). In India,the prevalence of complications was similar formen and women in hyperendemic areas, but asprevalence decreased, scarring trichiasis andblindness decreased more rapidly in men (289).Overall, Indian women had twice the rate ofcicatricial complications of trachoma compared tomen (302). In China, women were reported to havehigher rates of trichiasis and entropion (159) andsimilar observations were made in Poland (46),Morocco (331), Burma (332), Mexico (110) andVietnam (333,334). In South Africa, trichiasis was eight times and blindness four times more common in women(284). In Tanzania, trichiasis rates were four timeshigher in women with corneal opacity and visionloss was twice as common (295). In The Gambiascarring was 50% more common in women thanmen (293) and blindness from trachoma 3.5 timeshigher (335). Kupka and co-authors comment that in Morocco young girls are usually less well cared forthan boys, and females usually have constant andclose association with young children throughouttheir lives (331). They speculated that: Although the mother may at first be the source of infection for very young children, with the prevalenceof active cases among children close to 100 per cent,one can easily speculate on the possibility of theTHE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF TRACHOMA AND REINFECTION 109 testing, have confirmed earlier cytology findings that the vast majority of infection is in youngchildren, particularly pre-schoolchildren(92,301,324). In a longitudinal study in nine Tanzanian families, we used elementary body counts in DFAto give a measure of infectious load (297). Mostinfection was found in young children and in thosewith severe disease (TI) (297). Studies using semi-quantitative EIA in The Gambia showed apredominance of infection in children under 10.Bailey undertook a longitudinal study using EIA inwhich he examined some 250 people in 20households each week for six months (126). Theincidence of new infection decreased threefold withage. The highest infectious loads as determined byEIA were seen in younger children. He also notedan apparent reduction in the duration of episodesof infection with age; in 0 to 3 year olds infectionlasted some 13 weeks and in those 15 and above,infection lasted only 1.7 weeks. This notion ofdecreasing duration of infection with age isconsistent with field observations previously madeby Grayston, but in neither case was there ameasure of the exposure to potential episodes ofreinfection (126,316). Studies in Tanzaniasuggested TF would resolve in three to nine monthsafter a child ceased to be DFA positive (297). However, the advent of quantitative PCR gave a very compelling picture of the distribution ofinfectious load. Both in north and central Tanzania,studies showed the overwhelming predominance ofdemonstrable DNA was in young children(122,168). More than 90% of the community loadof infection was in children under the age of sevenin Rombo, a mesoendemic area, and twoindividuals with the highest loads were aged fiveand eight months. Over 50% was found in childrenunder the age of two in the hyperendemic area ofKongwa (122) (see Figure 6.11). However, young children in endemic areas not only have ocular infection with chlamydia, butchlamydia can also be cultured from other sites. InEgyptian villages 34% had extraocular infection(325). Positive cultures came from the eyes of 28%of children, and one-third with ocular infection alsohad extraocular infection. Nasopharyngealinfection was also examined in Tanzania where27% of children aged one to seven had chlamydiain nasopharyngeal swabs demonstrated by PCR(326) (see Figure 6.12). The presence ofnasopharyngeal chlamydia was correlated with the 108 TRACHOMA Figure 6.13 Women and children of the Terai in Nepal. Here, as in many places, women are more severely affected by trachoma than men (1989)TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:59 PM Page 108confirmed the slower age-related reduction of active trachoma rates in girls. In addition to contributing to the ocular pool of infection, mothers may interact with children inother ways. Reinhards postulated that trachomawas worse in women because they contractedbacterial conjunctivitis from children (324).Schachter and Dawson examined the role oftransmission of genital infection in women, andconcluded the genital tract was not an importantreservoir for transmission of trachoma (309). This isconsistent with the findings of Brunham and co-workers in Kenya, although they identifiedoccasional episodes of genital to ocular infection(330). A related study Nairobi found 7% ofbabies had chlamydial ophthalmia neonatorum andthe overall prevalence of genital tract infection withchlamydia in women was 21% (339). Although thiswas a hospital-based study, many women camefrom rural trachoma areas. However, the predominance of trachoma in women is not universal. As was the case in India,the gender difference was more marked in areas oflower prevalence (289). In areas of high prevalence,the rates between men and women may be moreequal. In Egypt where trichiasis rates were veryhigh (75% for women and 57% for men), thegender difference was quite small, although rates ofblindness and corneal opacity were still twofoldhigher in women (304). In Egypt, it was interestingto note that the rate of active trachoma in boys washigher than girls, even though women had higherrates of scarring. No gender difference in activetrachoma rates was reported from the large studyin Mali (242). A recent study in Ethiopia alsoreported no significant differences in rates of activetrachoma, scarring or trichiasis between men andwomen (243). There are some areas in which the rates of scarring, trichiasis and blindness are reported to be marginally higher in men than women\u2014forexample, Aboriginal people in Australia (103,340)(see Figure 6.16). Aboriginal boys and girls alsohave similar rates of active disease (311,341). Insome other areas, more severe disease is reported in boys, although these reports may be biased. InSamoa, this was attributed to boys tending fires and smoke irritation (281). In Okinawa,schoolboys had more trachoma than schoolgirls,but of course girls from poorer families would bemore likely to have trachoma and less likely toattend school (342). In Qatar it was noted thatmore males than females had scarring (118), butthis was a hospital-based study and may reflect thedifferential utilisation of health care services. If the explanation for the generally higher rates of trachoma in women was due to their prolongedexposure to children and the attendant risk of THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF TRACHOMA AND REINFECTION 111 mutual intensification of infection between mother and child reaching a vicious cycle. Higher rates ofreinfection amongst females and thus a prolongedcourse of the disease, increase the risk of severe lesionssuch as conjunctival or corneal complications and anearly age of onset of trichiasis (331). A Moroccan woman who as a child spent more than 15 years living with other children (brothersand sisters) incurred a 50% increased risk ofhaving grave trachoma (trichiasis or cornealscarring) (331). However, the risk was even greaterfor women who as adults had looked afterchildren. Those adults who cared for children formore than 15 years incurred a threefold risk ofgrave lesions. Women who had not looked afterchildren incurred the same risk as men. The higherexposure of women to (potentially infected)children is shown in The Gambia, where 95%shared a room with a child, but only 10% of mendid the same (293). Our population-based study in Tanzania confirmed the higher rate of cicatricial sequelae inwomen and increased rates of active disease inwomen who cared for children compared to thosewho did not (295). In another Tanzanian study, therisk of active trachoma in women was directlyrelated to caring for children with active trachoma,irrespective of facial cleanliness (336) (see Figure6.14). Compared to women living without childrenwith trachoma, the risk of active trachoma forwomen living with children with active trachomawas 1.6 times for non-caretakers and 2.4 times forcaretakers. A subsequent case control study of therisk of trichiasis in Tanzanian women identified anumber of indicators of poverty and poor hygieneincluding having a mother with trichiasis (337).The latter finding is tantalising and begs thefollowing questions. Is it nature or nurture, agenetic risk or a shared environment? The increased risk of trachoma for women starts from childhood. Girls tend to have more severetrachoma than boys. In Mexico most TI was foundin girls and active disease was also seen in oldergirls and young women. The rate of TF was twicethat in girls compared to boys (110). In this area ofMexico, girls aged five or more had a majorresponsibility in caring for their youngest siblings(120). Similar findings come from Tanzania, wheregirls incur higher rates of active disease whichcontinued for longer periods in girls than boys(338) (see Figure 6.15). Many studies have now 110 TRACHOMA Figure 6.15 A \"big sister\" looks after a baby sister in Nepal.Figure 6.16 The rates of trichiasis and blindness are marginally higher in Aboriginalmen than women.

Why were men still exposed to theinfectious pool? It is my impression that insubsistence farming settlements in Africa or Asiayoung children aged five to seven are more likely tomove away from the \"childcare group\". If they arelucky they may go to school, but if they are boys,they may well start farm work or tend animals. Onthe other hand, girls are more likely to stay at homeand care for younger children and assist theirmothers. This division of activities by gender is farless clear-cut in Australian Aboriginal communitiesfor example, with little commercial activity orsubsistence farming and intermittent schoolattendance. Natural experiments and the impact of socioeconomic development As discussed earlier, trachoma progressively decreased in Western Europe over the last centuryas living conditions improved. Over the last 60years, many have commented on the progressivedecrease in trachoma with concomitantsocioeconomic development and subsequentimprovement in living standards (162). Forexample, a decrease in trachoma was noted in thePunjab with decreased crowding, improvedsanitation and drainage, and increased provision ofopen space (289). In Jordan socioeconomicdevelopment led to a lower prevalence of trachomain towns than in surrounding villages (278). Thedecreased amount of trachoma in Indians whomigrated to Canada was ascribed to better personaland community hygiene with decreased crowding,dust and flies and cases of mucopurulentconjunctivitis (314). Jones related a specificdecrease in trachoma rates in southern Iran withthe development of oil pipelines and pumpingstations (91). Trachoma had declined in Malta by 1960 after it was made a notifiable disease in schoolchildren,overcrowded housing was addressed, piped waterwas provided, and sanitation and fly control wereintroduced (343). However, making trachoma anotifiable disease was not always an effectivemeasure in other areas. For example, Mackenzienotes it had little effect in France in the 1920s (46).The general improvement in the standard of livingin Saudi Arabian villages in the 1960s led to fallingrates of trachoma, although no specific factorswere identified (344). Thirty years later activetrachoma had essentially disappeared from SaudiArabia and the amount of blindness from trachomahad decreased dramatically (345). Trachomadecreased with the improved socioeconomicconditions in a Tunisian village after the opening ofa power station and chemical factory (138) (seeFigure 6.17). There was a dramatic decrease in theoverall prevalence and severity of trachoma in TheGambia over a 37 year period that paralleledimprovements in sanitation, water, education andhealth care (346). A similar decrease was alsonoted in Kenya (347). Economic analyses alsoquantify the link of less trachoma in areas ofgreater prosperity (348). None of these reports identified any specific intervention that led to a reduction in trachoma.Several explicitly state that \"no single factor\" couldbe identified (138,344). They share the commontheme of non-specific socioeconomic improvementsleading to a decrease in trachoma. However, severalhave noted that these general improvements firstled to a lowering in the intensity of activetrachoma. This was followed by a reduction in thelevels of infection and the incidence of activetrachoma that was followed in turn by a gradualdecrease in prevalence and ultimately a decrease inthe cicatricial complications (91,139,288,313,349).This sequence should have considerablesignificance when one considers the selection ofindicators used in the assessment of the impact oftrachoma control programs, where the emphasishas been on the prevalence of active trachoma (TF),almost the last measure to decline. Specific risk factors for trachoma The previous section broadly discussed somegeneral environmental factors that impact on theprevalence of trachoma. No doubt, if one sat andwaited for general socioeconomic development tooccur in every household in every village aroundthe world, trachoma would ultimately disappear.After all, it has disappeared from the whole ofTHE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF TRACHOMA AND REINFECTION 113 Figure 6.17 By the early 1980s, trachoma had essentially disappeared from Tunisia, with concomitant socioeconomicdevelopment that included TOP new houses CENTRE LEFT made roads and electricity CENTRE RIGHT more secure water supplies, and BOTTOM in one case, the building of a chemical factory.TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:59 PM Page 112Europe and North America and many other parts of the world over the last 50 to 100 years withprogressive improvements in the standard of living. One hundred years ago, Boldt was quite clear: \"There is no doubt that a low state of civilisation, want of cleanliness and overcrowding play an important part in spreading infection\"(15). Evenmore specific, MacCallan in 1908 listed a range of\"uncleanly habits of the lower classes\" thatincluded poor water availability, crowded huts,sleeping together and with their cattle, dust fromunpaved and unwatered streets, daily gales andsandstorms and for the rich, the presence ofinfected servants (89). In addition, of course,MacCallan also listed the epidemics of bacterialconjunctivitis in the early and late summer months.He also went on to state that \"trachoma is a purelylocal disease\" and maintained that \"the severity ofthe disease depends on ... the personal habits of theindividual and the conditions under which he lives\"(89). The beautiful back-to-back papers by Stuckyand Schereschewsky paint a strikingly similarpicture in Kentucky and American Indianreservations (75,76). The challenge for those of us who follow is to identify the specific personal habits and particularconditions that expose an individual to increasedrisk of trachoma, and then develop specificstrategies to address them. We cannot, with goodconscience, sit and wait for gradual improvementin socioeconomic status to reach the last familywith trachoma sometime in the next 100 or 200 years. The second WHO Expert Committee listed the risk factors for trachoma that included \"poverty,dirt, crowding and ignorance\" and associatedbacterial infection (33). The third WHO ExpertGroup expanded this list considerably (see Table6.1) (49). Although somewhat more specific, thiswas still a very broad umbrella and covered almostevery conceivable aspect of life, and did notmaterially advance our understanding, or foster thedevelopment of specific intervention strategies. Individual workers had identified various specific risk factors. Mann specifically identified theimportance of the introduction of textiles, clothesand blankets, in the absence of good personalhygiene in outback Australia, Papua New Guinea114 TRACHOMA Table 6.1: WHO Expert Committee on Trachoma, 1962 (49) Factors favouring transmission of infection Race, climate, including temperature, rainfall, altitude and amount of exposure to ultra-violet light Transmission by insect vectors (especially M. sorbens ) Density of population (crowding and institutions) Diet and nutrition Cultural and social customs, including organisation of the household; nomadic or stationary habits; religious practices; use of cosmetics; occupation (especially as a possible influence on varying sex or age distribution of cases); and availability and use of water General economic level of the area History, from the point of view of extrinsic contents (migration, invasion and trade routes) Status of education in the community Presence of other ocular or general diseasesInformation on as many as possible of the above points should be obtained in preliminary surveys of an area. This will require, in many cases, the co-operation of an epidemiologist and a sociologist or anthropologist; it is evident that any or all of these factors may have importance in explaining the incidence and characteristics of trachoma in a particular population. In heavily infected areas of low social and economic level, treatment campaigns alone have not been entirely effective, but education and sanitation, with emphasis on water supply, must also be improved concurrently.TABLE 6.2: Odds ratios for the range of community, family and individual risk factors for active trachoma (TF or TF/TI) examined by population-based epidemiologic surveys (significant associations are shown in bold) Author Taylor Tielsch Taylor Abdou 1985 1988 1989 1991 1992 1996 1992 2002 2003 2005 2006 2006 2007(110) (361) (241) (280) (285) (123) (360) (242) (372) (306) (253) (243) (394) Population Mexico Malawi Tanzania Egypt Brazil Nepal Ethiopia Mali Burkina Faso, factor all ages < 6 all ages all ages all ages 2 to 6.5 all ages <10 3 to 9 3 to 9 2 to 5 all ages 1 to 5 Community Development services n* nn 1.2 n Tube well 1.3 Altitude 4.2 Family Socioeconomic status n 2.0 n 1.1 Servants n Size/number of children n n n 1.3 1.5 n 3.4 n Crowding n 1.5 2.9 nn n Migration n n n Distance from school n Construction roof n n n n Construction walls n n n n n Construction floor n n n n Number of rooms n n n Separate kitchen n 2.7 n Family possessions nn n n Source of water n n n 3.7 1.9 nn n Distance to water n 2.6 1.3 n 1.3 / 1.4 nn n n Volume of water/household n Volume of water/person 2.8 n 2.2 Household flies 1.5 / 1.6 5.8 n Latrine absent n 1.7 n / 1.4 3.3 nn 1.9 n 2.0 nn n Rubbish disposal n 2.3 2.7 n 1.7 nn n n Religion 1.4 / 1.7 n Paternal education n 1.3 n 2.9 nnn 1.4 Maternal education n 1.6 nn n Maternal age n Maternal reproductive history n Knowledge of trachoma n Father's occupation 1.3 n nnn Animals owned n n n n 2.3 nn Cows/kept by house 1.4 1.5 n 1.2 1.8 3.1 nn Farm ownership/size n n Individual Frequency bathing n n 1.1 1.7 / 1.8 2.4 Frequency clothes washing n Frequency face washing 3.7 nn n n 1.25 n 2.5 1.4 Clean face 1.3 / 1.7 3.8 / 3.3 15.1 / 15.6 3.0# 4.1 3.1 Clean hair 1.7 Use of soap n 1.1 / 1.4 1.9 1.5 Use of towel/drying n 1.3 n n Use of used water n Nose cleaning method n 1.6 1.6 / 2.3 Clothes washed frequently n Clothes washing site n Washing bed linen n Facial flies n 1.9/1.5 3.4# 1.9 2.4 Sleeping with cooking fire 1.2 Number in bedroom n 3.9\u00b6 nn Siblings with trachoma 4.2 4.4 Preschool siblings n n *examined but no significant association found urban/rural, size, presence of store, market, mill, health centre/pharmacy, church/mosque, school, bus route family ownership of bicycle, car, watch, radio, television, iron, refrigerator, farm equipment \u00b6sleeping with other children #ocular discharge plus flies Odds ratio = 8.3TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:59 PM Page 114The National Trachoma and Eye Health Program My first experience of working with trachoma was in the NTEHP, directed by Fred Hollows, fundedby the Australian Government and run by theRoyal Australian College of Ophthalmologists. TheCollege conducted fieldwork across Australia from1976 to 1978. In total, 62,116 Aboriginal peopleand 38,616 non-Aboriginal people were examinedin 426 communities and towns (103). I spent a yearor so in the field as Assistant Director and learnt atremendous amount from Fred Hollows andexperience in the field (see Figure 6.18). Aspreviously mentioned, an overwhelming impressionwas the difference in hygiene in those individuals orcommunities with trachoma compared to thosewithout. The NTEHP examined Aboriginal people living over the entire continent with the exception ofmajor cities. Because of the broad geographic areacovered, the program was able to look atenvironmental factors such as latitude, daily hoursof sunshine, evaporation, rainfall, humidity and UVradiation. These analyses confirmed that trachomawas more common in the hot, dry desert areas ofAustralia than along the more humid or temperatecoastal regions (103) (see Figure 6.19). A high level assessment was made of six hygiene parameters: water access, nutritional status, foodstorage facilities, waste disposal systems, seweragesystems and housing (103,357). These werecollected at the community level, with a grading of \"worse half\" and \"better half\" of thecommunity (see Figure 6.20). An aggregate indexwas constructed known as the Waterford Index.Each parameter had four grades (except foodstorage and waste disposal, which were only giventhree grades). An extensive analysis wasundertaken, but it was limited to the presentationof stratified univariant analyses as multivariantanalysis was not generally in use at that time. Asthese factors are inevitably linked in various ways it would have been interesting to see the results of a more sophisticated analysis. Follicular trachoma,cicatricial trachoma and blindness were eachstrongly and significantly related to poor rankingsin each of the above hygiene parameters (see Figure 6.21). In reviewing these findings, Hollows stressed that good home hygiene required the use of certain\"health hardware\" and pointed out that: During the last 35 years, home hygiene for white persons in Australia has undergone significant butunsung improvement. For white Australians,reticulated and heated washing-water, showers,clothes-washing facilities, the single occupancy of bedsand no overcrowding in rooms have becomeuniversal; not so for most inland AboriginalAustralians. Hollows set out some basic housing requirements he considered everyone should have: All houses should have reticulated water supplied to them at a rate of 100 litres per person per day; oneshower for every 10 persons; a means of heatingwater; a means of washing clothes and bed linen (thisalmost always requires electricity in CentralAustralia); elevated, separated and ventilated beds; nomore than two persons per three metre squarebedroom; all exterior openings with fly screens;washable floor surfaces; all inside areas free ofanimals; and one toilet per 10 occupants. Having worked with Fred in the field as a mentor, and having developed a strong personal friendshiptaught me that if one disagreed with Fred, one wasusually wrong. Although I agree with his broadrange of requirements for healthy living, I hopethese subsequent sections dealing with somespecific epidemiologic studies of trachoma willshow why I believe a much more focused approachto facial cleanliness is the key to understandingtrachoma epidemiology and hence its control.Facial cleanliness seems to be the final commonpathway through which all the other health andenvironmental parameters impact on the one hand;and on the other, it is the pathway by whichinfection is spread from one eye to another. Crowding Many have suggested that crowding is animportant risk factor for trachoma and as aninfectious disease, this would not necessarily besurprising. Although attention to crowds wasdrawn by earlier observers, it was not until theTHE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF TRACHOMA AND REINFECTION 117 and various Pacific Islands (90,350). Others haddrawn specific attention to the use of mothers'clothes, a saree, dohti or shawl, to blow children'snoses and clean and dry their faces (289,302). Thiswas potentially a potent way of spreadingchlamydia, as chlamydia had been shown towithstand drying on cloth for several hours fromthe earliest studies (143,351,352). And, of course,face washing with clean running water and notsharing towels was enshrined in military practicesince the Egyptian campaign (15,16). Others produced encyclopaedic lists of problems such as poverty-stricken homes, lack of water forwashing, cultural and religious traditions,education, dust and flies (69), or smoke, dust, UV,sand grains, lack of water, poverty, overcrowdingand heat (332), or lack of water, humidity,mechanical trauma from sandstorms, dust, frequenthand shaking, flies and poor hygiene (308), director indirect contact with infected material (hands,clothing, towels, etc.) and environmental andbehavioural features including the presence ofyoung children, crowding and lack of safe water,inadequate disposal of human and animal wasteand increased flies (353). To advance, specificepidemiologic studies of risk factors were required.The list of potential factors that have beenexamined in rigorous studies is enormous andincluded community, family and individual factors(see Table 6.2). In examining these studies and the data they generated, it is just as important to look at thosefactors that were not included in particular surveys,for example, the work in Nepal did not collectindividual data other than the presence or absenceof trachoma in the child (123). This study couldtherefore not assess facial hygiene, although otherfactors that were indirectly linked (proxies) mightappear to be linked to trachoma. If the moreproximate factor\u2014a clean face\u2014had beenincluded, the proxy probably would no longerappear to be important. In the final analysis, it isthe individual's status and behaviour that is mostimportant. Without individual information, thefamily and community level data can only provideproxies or indicators of individual behaviour.Although these broad studies can give leads,without the ultimate or most proximate factor(s)they can only be indicative.The more consistent risk factors identified by these studies will be discussed in more detail in thefollowing sections. Many other studies have lookedat one or two risk factors, but have not had abroad enough scope to assess the impact ofpotentially confounding factors. They have alsobeen limited by their small sample size. A few haveexamined the link between nutrition and trachomabut consistent associations have not beendemonstrated (300,354,355,354). At the DanaCenter, we examined in detail a potential linkbetween xerophthalmia and trachoma in multiplestudies in Malawi, Zambia, Tanzania and Nepalbut failed to find an association, and these negativefindings were not published in detail. Beforemoving on to studies of specific risk factors, I wantto review the work undertaken by the NationalTrachoma and Eye Health Program (NTEHP) inAustralia. 116 TRACHOMA Figure 6.18 In the field Hollows during the NTEHP (1977).TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:59 PM Page 1161960s that its impact was quantified. Detailed studies in Taiwan showed that the number of people per ping (the Taiwanese unit of area approximately 3.3 metres square) was asignificant risk factor for trachoma after stratifyingfor water supply, parental occupation andsocioeconomic status (349,358). In areas of lowendemicity people with a lower socioeconomicstatus had increased risk of trachoma, but in areaswith a higher level of endemicity, even those with ahigh socioeconomic status were at risk. Theincreased rate of trachoma amongst the war-timecohort of infants and children was attributed toincreased crowding during the war. Other indicators and proxies have been used to assess the effect of crowding, such as family size orthe number of children in the family (282). Morerefined measures have ascertained the number ofpeople sleeping together in one bedroom (123,280,283,285,359,360,361). An even better indicator of the risk of acquiring trachoma attributable to \"crowding\" or sleepingclose together is the presence of another child withtrachoma who shares the same bedroom (see Figure6.22). This has been found to be a significant riskfactor in multiple studies in The Gambia (284),Malawi (361), Egypt (280) and Tanzania (283),although it was not significant in Mali (242) orSenegal (253). These studies have shown that by increasing precision in the measurement of \"crowding\", thekey effect turns out to be the close proximity ofchildren with other children with active disease,especially if this occurs during prolonged contactthrough the night when children sleep together,usually on the same cot or mattress or under thesame blanket or animal skin. Water It can be difficult to measure the availability ofwater. Should access to the water source bemeasured in time or distance, is an estimateacceptable or does access change with the season?Can other surrogates be used? These issues plaguethe assessment of water supply, let alone the actualutilisation of household water. Punjab villages withhand pumps or a well had less evidence oftrachoma than villages without (289). However, thereal difference was attributed to the quality ratherthan quantity of water. No link between active trachoma and distance to the water source was found in a study in Moroccothat examined distances from less than 50 metresto those over 2.5 kilometres (331). Nor was a linkTHE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF TRACHOMA AND REINFECTION 119 Figure 6.22 Map showing the distribution of cases of active trachoma by roomand compound in Jali(Bailey et al 1989 (284)with permission of OxfordUniversity Press).

However, families thatused more water used the extra water for hygienepurposes, particularly for washing their children,and there were lower rates of active trachoma.Thus the quantity of water used was important.These findings have been repeated in a recent studyin Tanzania (362). In Okinawa and the Ryukuyu Islands, the provision of piped water changed patterns of wateruse from \"water scarce\" to \"water rich\", and thiswas associated with a decrease in trachomaprevalence (342). As water became more readilyavailable more was used for personal hygiene. Thevolume of water was considered more importantthan its purity, the opposite conclusion to thePunjab study (289). A rather perverse occurrencewas noted in a school that had had piped waterinstalled. A long trough with multiple washing tapshad been installed. Each child was required to washtheir face and hands before eating and each wasexpected to bring their own clean towel. Manychildren forgot their towels and Marshallcomments: \"I observed the same towel used to drythe hands and faces of more than a dozenchildren\". He was concerned that this would leadto an increase in trachoma. Others have widely reported a variable association between water availability andtrachoma (110,120,284,332,358,361,363,364,365). Prost and Negrel undertook a thoroughreview of available studies of water and trachomain 1989 and concluded there was a generalreduction in trachoma rates as water accessimproved (366). Our population-based study in Tanzania looked at water availability in some detail (241,367).There was a significant linkage, for example,between water distance and the risk of trachoma(see Figure 6.23). Although definable, the increasedrisk was quite small; for those whose water sourceswere more than 30 minutes distance, the riskincreased by about 40% (odds ratio 1.45 for 0.5 totwo hours to the water source; 1.37 for greaterthan two hours). The total volume of householdwater was also assessed, although not adjusted forfamily size. Household quantities were grouped asusing less than 15 litres per household per day,between 15 and 45 litres or greater. Householdwater quantity was not linked to the risk oftrachoma. We also examined the relationship between clean faces and both the distance to water (time) andquantity of water used (367). Again, time was animportant factor with approximately 40% increasein trachoma risk with an unclean face in childrenwhose family lived more than 30 minutes fromtheir water source (0.5 to two hours, odds ratio1.14; greater than two hours, odds ratio 1.55) (see Figure 6.24). We concluded that distance to the water source was not the prime determinant for the presence of trachoma, but rather distanceinfluenced the value placed on water, and thereforeits priority. When water was seen as a scarceresource, it was not used for personal hygiene andthe children's faces were not clean. This wouldpoint to the importance of facial cleanliness.However, this not only showed the need to improveaccess to water but also the need to addressutilisation behaviour. Further work would show thecomplexity of this behaviour (368). Along with thenotion of health hardware learnt from FredHollows came the additional component of \"healthsoftware\" to make the hardware effective (2). Evidence to support this notion was also seen in studies in Brazil, where those with either anisolated tap outside the house or no piped waterhad lower monthly water consumption than thosewith piped water inside the house and the latterpopulation had higher rates of trachoma (285) (seeTable 6.3). Frequency of face washing could not beanalysed because almost every mother said theirchildren's faces were washed every day. An analysisof water use in The Gambia showed on averagethat children without trachoma used more water(6.4 litres/child/day) than children with trachoma(4.2 litres/child/day) (364). In northern Tanzania,only a weak association was found between GPS-determined distance to the water source andtrachoma after adjustments were made for thefamily clustering of trachoma (62). Other studieshave shown that household consumption of waterdoes not vary much when water is obtained fromsources between five and 30 minutes away (369). In general, water use increases when the source iscloser and decreases with distance, althoughextreme (greater than five hours) water use is muchmore restricted (370).

The family needsenough water to keep a child's face clean and alsoneeds to prioritise water use for this purpose. InTanzania, we found as little as 30mls of water wassufficient to wash one face. Faye in Senegal found the risk of trachoma doubled if less than 10 litres of water were used tobathe a child (253). Trachoma was not related tothe distance to water. In Mali, Schemann foundthat the presence of a well inside the compoundreduced the risk of active trachoma (TF/I) and alsoTI, but the volume of water used for washing wasnot significant in a multivariate analysis (242). Onewonders what the outcome may have been if thevolume of water used was substituted for distancein his final analysis. Possibly the presence of a wellin the compound is a better surrogate for the actualuse of water than the self-reported estimate ofvolume. Mesfin found an association betweenwater source or distance in Ethiopia (243). The use of water was studied in more detail in Northern Tanzania (362). Although those wholived closer to water (less than 85 minutes) had lesstrachoma and used more water, there was not asignificant correlation between quantity of Figure 6.25 Washing a child at a communal well in Nepal (1990).ABOVE Figure 6.26 A village in the Nile Delta where there is often a mixture of animal and human faeces that accumulate in large piles(1981).

Further analysis showed the importantfactor was the proportion of water prioritised forpersonal hygiene. Households closer to their watersource used more water for bathing and facewashing. The mean daily volume used for personalhygiene was 4.25 litres per person or 24% ofhousehold water. This study emphasises theimportance of behaviour and attitudes aroundwater use over the absolute availability of water. The role of latrines Some have seen the presence of a nice clean, butused latrine as the answer to trachoma, even aventilated improved pit (VIP) latrine. Certainlymany have observed that the absence of latrines, orother more advanced methods of human faecesdisposal, is an important indicator of inadequatefamily hygiene. In Egypt, the absence of a latrine increased the risks of trachoma about threefold (odds ratio 3.3)(280). For comparison, the odds ratio associatedwith trachoma in a school-age sibling was 4.4, andfor other preschool siblings 1.3. However, a morerecent study in Egypt found the association withlatrines to be inconsistent (371). Attention wasdrawn to the linkage between human and animalfaecal matter around the house and increased flydensity (see Figure 6.26). This issue was alsoexamined in some detail in central Tanzania (241).We found no significant association with thepresence of active trachoma (TF) and the methodof household faecal disposal, although thelikelihood of severe inflammation (TI) was reducedwith a latrine. Studies in Malawi (242), Mali (361)and Ethiopia (306) also found less trachoma inhouses with a latrine, whereas other studies inMexico (110), Brazil (285), Burkina Faso (372),Ethiopia (243) and Senegal (253) did not. GPSmapping in a mesoendemic area in northernTanzania also found no association betweentrachoma and the presence of a latrine or itsdistance from the house (62) (see Figure 6.27). The installation of improved household pit latrines in Gambian villages significantly decreasedthe numbers of eye-seeking fly Musca sorbens , although the domestic fly ( domestica) and a large green fly ( Chrysomya albiceps) were still present in unabated numbers (373). As discussedbelow, eye-seeking M. sorbens has been implicated in transferring trachoma infection from one child toanother or from one eye to another. This studyshowed M. sorbens can be controlled, at least in part, by improved human faecal disposal, althoughthis intervention did not significantly reduce theprevalence of trachoma (374). It is hard to determine a direct link between pit latrines and trachoma, although a reduction in eye-seeking flies could provide an indirect linkage insome areas. The presence of a nice new latrine, ofcourse, can be a proxy indicator of general familyhygiene. It is linked to the readiness to adopt newways and behaviours and also is an indicator ofsocioeconomic development and family attitudes topersonal hygiene. To my mind, as we will see, thekey is faces, not faeces. Flies References to flies around children's faces andtrachoma in Egypt date to the late 1500s andBaron Harant of Poljitz (4) (see Figure 6.28).Equally there are claims and examples that flieswere not important that date back almost acentury. Stucky commented that there were notmany flies in the mountains in Kentucky. Trachomapersisted in these small communities not because offlies, but because everybody used one towel: \"It is afilth disease. They are ignorant; they are unlettered.They know nothing of hygiene, nothing ofsanitation\" (77)\u2014strong words. MacCallan also quotes many other commentators on the importance of flies (4).124 TRACHOMA Figure 6.29 Fly-borne transmission of ocular discharges within a pool of ocular promiscuity (Jones 1975 (91) \u00a9 1975 Eye, reproduced with per mission).

He also stated that large numbers of flies were able to breed \"because ofcomplete lack of sanitary measures to dispose ofhuman and animal excretia\" (324). Flies contrib-uted to the spread of bacterial conjunctivitis (381)that in turn facilitated the transmission of trachoma.However, although fly control with chlordaneresidual insecticides gave a temporary reduction inbacterial conjunctivitis, it had no effect on trachomaprevalence or trachoma resolution (139). Flies were implicated in the transmission of trachoma in Malta (343) but not in Saudi Arabia(290) or in the Punjab studies (289). Sowa in TheGambia remarked \"flies are often blamed asvectors, but trachoma is known to flourish in areasthat are comparatively free of these insects\" (301).Mann also pointed out there are no flies in manyparts of the highlands of Papua New Guinea andvarious Pacific Islands, despite much evidence oftrachoma (382). However, in the Australianoutback Flynn commented on the incessantpresence of the eye-seeking Australian bush fly, M. vetustissima (383). It occupies the ecologic niche occupied by M. sorbens elsewhere (384) and is ubiquitous in the Australian bush (385). When preparing for our studies in the mountains of Chiapas, Mexico, my colleague Milan Trpis,Professor of Medical Entomology at JohnsHopkins, accompanied me to work out how wecould quantify flies in this area. It was too easy forhim, for there were none. This was yet another areawhere trachoma occurred in the absence of fliesand Milan spent the week collecting butterflies. For our studies in Tanzania, we developed a simple method of assessing household fly densities(386). A wooden board was moistened with sugarwater and set on either side of the door to thehouse (see Figure 6.31). These boards attracted M. sorbens and the number of flies that alighted on the board were counted. This method gave areproducible household count. Fly densities werehighest around the doorway to the house. Countswere fairly constant throughout the day and didnot vary markedly with sun or shade. Highercounts were associated with the presence of foodscraps and rubbish that attracted flies with theirmoisture, although this rubbish did not provide abreeding ground because M. sorbens breeds in human faeces (387). We found a significantcorrelation between household fly density and the presence of active and severe trachoma inchildren (241). Our study in Malawi found a weak association between the presence of flies on the face andtrachoma (388). This work was extended byBrechner and colleagues who found that themeasure of the presence of flies on the face had amore consistent and stronger association with theTHE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF TRACHOMA AND REINFECTION 127 Wilson and Meyerhof drew attention to seasonalepidemics of flies in Egypt and associated epidemicsof bacterial conjunctivitis that in turn were alsolinked to the transmission of trachoma (26,32). In 1911 Nataf showed that flies could transmit experimental trachoma infection from an infectedhuman to a monkey and from the eyes of onemonkey to another (4). Darougar showed fliescould transmit viable and infectious chlamydia (C. caevi ) from one guinea pig to another (375). Emerson found chlamydia DNA by PCR in 0.5%of flies caught on children's faces and documentedfrequent fly-eye contact In inbetween 15% and 23% of M. sorbens caught on the faces of children (377,378). Barrie Jones performed some beautiful experiments in southern Iran with a group ofwomen and children sitting together on a blanket(91) (see Figure 6.29). He placed a drop offluorescein into the eye of a child and examinedthem with a blue light 20 and 40 minutes later. Hewas able to demonstrate the transfer of fluoresceinfrom the child's eye to the eyes of the others in thegroup and also found \"fly spots\" around their facesand on their clothes. This elegant study indicatedthe ability of flies to easily transfer ocularsecretions from one human eye to another. The first WHO Expert Committee on Trachoma came out very strongly on the importance of fliesand the control of vectors (20) stating \"TheCommittee considers that fly control is reallyefficacious, at least in the prophylaxis of acuteconjunctivitis\". This was in the era when DDT wasfirst widely used to control many vector-bornediseases and its long lasting environmental effectshad not yet been appreciated. In the same year, amassive hygiene improving intervention in Egyptiandelta villages was underway that included thecontrol of flies with DDT (379). The impact thatfly control had had on trachoma was unclear,although there was a marked reduction ingonococcal conjunctivitis and some reduction inconjunctivitis associated with Koch-Weeks bacillus(379,380). Studies in India showed a marked seasonal variation in Koch-Weeks conjunctivitis with peaksin April and May and August and Septemberattributed to increased numbers of M. sorbens (302). These were similar to those trends seen inEgypt (32). However, in India there was noseasonal change in active trachoma in children.Female M. sorbens were particularly attracted to the faces of children with trachoma and they weremore likely to suffer from episodes of acutebacterial conjunctivitis (see Figure 6.30). Thisobservation is both consistent with flies beingattracted to ocular discharge and conveyingbacterial secondary infection. Reinhards considered flies to be the main vectorTable 6.4: Association between active trachoma (TF/I) and observed characteristics of children studied in Ethiopia, 2005 (n = 1960) (306) FactorNumber and percentage Multivariate odds ratio (95 per cent CI)* Discharge from eyes and flies in eyes No discharge or flies 627 (47) 1 Discharge but no flies 103 (75) 3.0 (1.94-4.55)Flies but no discharge 682 (79) 3.40 (2.37-4.88) Discharge and flies 539 (92) 8.30 (4.94-13.90) Clean hair Yes 1090 (64) 1 No 867 (82) 2.50 (1.66-3.76) *Adjusted for kebele , age, clean hair, discharge from eye and flies in eyes Figure 6.31 \"Mirinda\" boards used to quantify household flies in Tanzania (1986).

TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 3:01 PM Page 126presence of active trachoma than the household fly score and was less susceptible to seasonal variation(389). A similar significant association betweenflies on the face and trachoma has been confirmedin a number of other studies in Mali (242),Ethiopia (306) (see Table 6.4) and Senegal (253).Flies are preferentially attracted to the faces ofchildren with trachoma, especially those with dirtyfaces (376). In Burkina Faso, the presence of flieson the face increased the risk of active trachomanearly 5.8 fold, a dirty face increased the risk oftrachoma 15 fold, but a dirty face increased the riskof flies on the face 334 times (372). An earlierstudy in Ethiopia also found an associationbetween trachoma and both the presence of flies onthe face and cattle ownership (390). This studyfocused on the association with cows rather thanflies and recommended the construction of corralsto reduce trachoma. In a large and labour-intensive study Paul Emerson and colleagues used insecticide fogging tocontrol M. sorbens in Gambian villages (374). They found they could reduce the number of flies for aslong as they continued their fogging activities andsubsequently trachoma rates were also reduced.Interestingly, a recent study from Tanzania hasshown no added benefit to fly reduction in additionto the community-based treatment withazithromycin in a hyperendemic area (391). Thislarge, thorough prospective clinical trial objectivelygraded clinical disease with photographs andassessed infection by PCR. It used the same foggingmethods to control flies as the Gambian study, butcomplemented these with azithromycindistribution. However, a facial hygiene componentwas not included. In this context, fly control gaveno benefit in addition to antibiotic treatment. A number of studies have looked at the association between animal ownership andtrachoma. In some studies, animal ownership isregarded as a measure of economic wealth and hasa protective effect against trachoma (123,360). InTanzania and some areas in Ethiopia animals,especially cattle, are kept close to the house (seeFigure 6.32). This is usually associated withincreased numbers of flies and an increased risk oftrachoma (241,306,390) but not always (243,372). The cows themselves will not directly influence the presence or severity of trachoma. As mentioned,M. sorbens breed almost exclusively in humanfaeces and so the presence of animal faeces will notcontribute to breeding, although M. domestica and other flies will breed in animal faeces. However,animal faeces provide moisture and sheltered restingspots for flies. In this way, the housing of cows closeto the household may increase the overall fly densityincluding M. sorbens , and thus increase the likelihood of flies on the face. As Miller points out, flies can be convincingly implicated as vectors of trachoma and they fulfilBarnett's criteria of (1) effective contact undernatural conditions, (2) convincing temporal andgeographic association of the presence of vectorand infection, (3) the vector harbours the pathogen,and (4) experimental transmission can bedemonstrated (377). However, although flies mayplay a contributory role as vectors, they are clearlynot essential as blinding endemic trachoma can stilloccur in areas without flies. Facial hygiene In the Napoleonic Wars and in 19th centuryEuropean barracks, there was an inverted U-shapedassociation between face washing and militaryophthalmia or trachoma (16). Officers who washedtheir face in the privacy of their tents with theirown water were protected from trachoma as werethose soldiers who were dirty but never washedtheir face. The big risk factor for trachoma was thesharing of common washing water and commontowels amongst ordinary soldiers who washed fromtime to time. This led to fastidiousrecommendations about face washing practices forsoldiers and also laid the foundation for hygienepractices in trachoma schools that were establishedfor children in England and North America. New cases of trachoma amongst Indian children in the American south-west were attributed to thesharing of washing water and towels (76,359). Theuse of the mother's clothes or a common towel towipe children's faces clean was noted in Kentucky(75) and India (289). In Morocco, children underthe age of four had the highest frequency oftrachoma and bacterial conjunctivitis (324). Theyalso had the most severe ocular discharge andattracted the most flies because their faces weredirty, and \"they are touched by their mothers ortheir sisters in a most unhygienic way\" (324). Aspreviously mentioned, Marshall was concernedabout the sharing of towels when water wasTHE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF TRACHOMA AND REINFECTION 129 RIGHT Figure 6.33 A towel, wash basin and soap outside a school inMexico. It is unclear howoften it was used (1982). BELOW Figure 6.34 Trachoma fieldwork inChiapas, Mexico (1985).TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 3:01 PM Page 128Figure 6.35 The Tanzanian trachoma risk factor study ABOVE Sheila West co-ordinating fieldwork BELOW a household interview (1986).introduced to schools in Okinawa (342). However, when children in an Aboriginal community inWestern Australia were showered and providedwith clean clothes each day at school, trachomadecreased (365). My opportunity to examine the role of facial hygiene and trachoma first came aboutunexpectedly. I was working in a lovely little townin the highlands of southern Mexico called SanChristobal de las Casas. We were conducting drugstudies on onchocerciasis and I was examiningpatients in a dark room. A young Mexican publichealth doctor, Francisco Millan-Velasco, came inlooking for the ophthalmologist who was in townwho knew something about trachoma. Wesubsequently did a quick survey and confirmed thepresence of trachoma in the small Mayan Indianvillages clustered along the mountain ridges ofcentral Chiapas (109) (see Figures 6.33 and 6.34). We then undertook a more formal study specifically looking at potential risk factors fortrachoma, especially those that would favourfrequent episodes of transmission and thepossibility of reinfection (110). As shown, weselected a large range of possible indicators, one ofwhich was the frequency with which children hadtheir faces washed (Table 6.2). This study found astrong, consistent association between trachomaand children whose faces were washed less thanseven times a week and those children whose faceswere washed more often (see Table 6.5) (110). Thisassociation was independent of the use of soap ortowels, although the use of a handkerchief to cleanthe child's nose was also protective (odds ratio 1.5;for face washing, odds ratio 3.5). The populationattributable to risk of face washing was 57%. We were fortunate in this study as we seemed to get reasonably reliable answers to our questionsabout face washing. In a follow-up study in thesame area, we failed to demonstrate a statisticallysignificant association as two-thirds of the childrenwere reported to have their faces washed every day.In a separate study in Malawi, almost two-thirds ofthe children were reported as having their facewashed twice a day! (361). A clean face reduced therisk of trachoma by 40% but this finding was notstatistically significant. Similar reporting problemswere encountered in Brazil (285) and Ethiopia (360). Then the penny dropped and we recognised that it was not the process, or the frequency with whichthe face was washed, although this was important.It was the outcome. Did the child have a clean face?If the child's face was already clean it would notmatter if it were washed or not. If the child's facewas dirty and had been washed, but was still dirtyor had become dirty again, it required furtherwashing until it was clean. Another confoundingfactor may be the ascertainment bias related to thedifference between an observed clean face and thereport by the mother or child of the frequency offace washing. In our next study in Tanzania, we documented both the frequency with which faces were washed(process) and whether faces were clean (outcome)(see Figure 6.35). Facial cleanliness was found to bestrikingly important to protect against both activetrachoma (TF/TI, odds ratio 1.30) and severe inflam-matory trachoma (TI, odds ratio 1.72) (241). Thefrequency of washing was less strongly associated.A case control study in The Gambia supported theimportance of outcome; an unclean face increasedthe risk of trachoma 2.96 times, but the associationwith washing a child's face less than twice a day wasmuch less strong (odds ratio 1.14) (364). Other recent studies have also looked at the question of face washing and facial cleanliness.Jean-Francoise Schemann and his team from IOTAin Mali undertook a major study of 15,187children under the age of 10 (242). They found ahigh risk of active trachoma as their measure ofpersonal hygiene became more specific; for thosewho bathed less than once a day, the odds ratiowas 1.12, for those who usually used soap 1.14,washed their face less than once a day 1.32 and forthose with a dirty face 3.80 (see Table 6.6) (242). Afurther large study in Burkina Faso reinforced theimportance of facial cleanliness and found an oddsratio of 15.1 for active trachoma and 15.6 for TI(372). Similar data comes from Senegal wherethose whose faces were not washed daily incurred a2.50 risk of active trachoma and those with a dirtyface, 4.07 (253). In Ethiopia a correlation wasfound between the number of days since the child'sface had been washed and the risk of trachoma;odds ratio 1.35 per day (243) and the study in Malifound a linear reduction with the number of timesthe face was washed in a day (242). Although theseare interesting findings, these analyses address theprocess of washing and not the outcome of a cleanface (see Figure 6.36). 130 TRACHOMATRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 3:01 PM Page 130by Thygeson as \"poverty-stricken homes, want of water for washing, culture and religious traditions,education, dust and flies\" (69). The final commonpathway for all these environmental factors isthrough ocular and nasal discharge that produces adirty face in young children (see Figure 6.38).Adequate water is required to keep children's facesclean and in areas where water is in short supply,personal hygiene is given a low priority within thefamily. This is particularly true in hot, dry, dustyand dirty areas. In areas where water is not readilyavailable, the provision of adequate water oftencomes at a relatively late stage in socioeconomicdevelopment. Families that are better off will bemore likely to have better water supplies sooner.Thus trachoma can appear to be a disease ofpoverty. However, the volume of water itself is notcritical; even in those families who used less than15 litres of water per day, some children have cleanfaces and do not have trachoma. A dirty face and ocular discharge increases the possibility of the direct spread of trachoma bydirect face to face contact as children sleep together,or by indirect means through fingers with one childrubbing their face or eye and then playing withother children. Dirty fingers will contaminateclothes and other items. Mothers' fingers are alsoused at times to remove ocular nasal discharge. Adirty face is also more likely to attract the shawl orsaree of the mother who will clean or wipe one of her children's faces and then the next. A dirtyface is an attractant to flies which can pick upchlamydia with or without other bacterialpathogens, fly to the next child's face, andregurgitate the previous meal with its bacterial loadand ingest fresh ocular secretions. In this way, fliescould convey both trachoma and bacterialpathogens. Of course, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. In this day and age, one needs a prospectiverandomised clinical trial. With Sheila West and alarge team we undertook specific interventionpromoting facial cleanliness in central Tanzania(393). We were very careful to emphasise theoutcome\u2014clean faces, not the process\u2014facewashing. We studied 1417 children aged one toseven in six villages. At one year, children inintervention villages were 60% more likely to haveconsistently clean faces. As found in theobservational studies of hygiene improvement,severe trachoma (TI) was the first sign to reduce,and odds in intervention villages were 0.62. Of equal importance was that a consistently cleanface reduced the odds of active trachoma (TF/TI) to0.58 and TI to 0.35, over and above the impact ofcommunity-wide antibiotic treatment (topicaltetracycline). In 1989, I wrote: It seems likely that these two key factors, facial cleanliness and fly density, would both directlyinfluence transmission. An unclean face wouldincrease the likelihood of that child transmittingtrachoma to others either by direct contact or bycontact with fingers, flies, or with clothes or otherfomites. Similarly, a child with an unclean face is more132 TRACHOMA Table 6.5: Occurrence of trachoma in children aged 10 or less by the frequency with which their faces are washed in Mexico, 1985 (110) Frequency of face washing Number of childrenPercentage with trachoma (times per week)Severity of trachoma Both communities*NoneModerateSevere 01 1 8 2 4 8 1-2 77 36 7 36 3-6 207 35 5 27 7 154 17 1 10 *Comparison of the severity of trachoma between face washing 0-6 times per week and 7 times per week.

They demonstrated that the key componentof a dirty face was the presence of nasal discharge(see Table 6.7) (392). Of even greater importancewas the increase in risk associated with thecombination of both flies and nasal discharge (oddsratio 1.74). In families with three or more pre-schoolchildren, the presence of flies and nasaldischarge increased the risk of trachoma 2.1 times,with a sibling with trachoma 4.3 times, and bothhaving a sibling with trachoma and flies and nasaldischarge increased the risk 6.8 times (see Figure6.37). As mentioned earlier, chlamydia can beidentified in nasal secretions (328). To my mind, these studies in Tanzania really provide the key to unlock the critical components ofthe \"trachoma friendly\" environment characterisedTable 6.7: Facial cleanliness and risk of trachoma in children aged one to seven years in Tanzania (n=472) (392) Facial signPercentage with facial sign Age-adjusted odds ratio (95 per cent CI) Food 40 0.91 (0.63-1.34) \"Sleep\" in eyes 60 1.13 (0.77-1.64) Nasal discharge 70 1.31 (0.87-1.97) Dust 70 1.18 (0.79-1.76) Flies on face 1.37 (0.93-2.00) [sic] 1-2 49 >2 14 Nasal discharge and EPIDEMIOLOGY OF TRACHOMA AND REINFECTION 133TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 3:01 PM Page 132likely to become infected, as it is more attractive to the mucus-seeking flies that can transfer chlamydia.Within a family, an increase in transmission bychildren being either \"transmitters\" or \"receivers\",together with facilitated transfer due to increased flynumbers, would lead to more frequent episodes ofreinfection within that family. This would lead to ahigher prevalence and severity of disease and anincreased risk of eventual blindness (241). Today, I would give much more weight to the dirty face. As we will see, the recognition of facial cleanliness gives a clear focus and target forintervention strategies and means that we\u2014thosewho are interested in eliminating blindingtrachoma\u2014do not need to wait for the broadimprovement in personal and community hygienethat comes with socioeconomic development. Wecan hone in on facial cleanliness and immediateenvironmental barriers to achieve this in any givencommunity.

In part, this variation seems to be ecological as blinding trachoma occurs in certain environments, but disappears with improved living standards. Variation may be due to genetic factors inthe host (or in the organism). What is the evidence for host genetic factors to play a majorrole in determining the severity of trachoma? Trachoma is not really a \"disease of poverty\" but disease of immunopathology , characterised by a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction maintained by the continuing presence of infection. Trachoma can thus be likened to\"chronic poison ivy\". Most studies suggest the overwhelming importance of repeated episodes of reinfection in maintaining the presence of chlamydial antigens. However, the notion of persistent infectioncan be dismissed as merely unrecognised reinfection. There may be a few individuals inwhom chlamydia truly persists for prolonged periods, but the interpretation of thesefindings is difficult and one needs to balance the general and the particular. A tobacco industry analogy is instructive. If everyone smoked, lung cancer would be considered a genetic disease. In this scenario, even though everybody was exposed tocigarette smoke, only a proportion of people would develop lung cancer. Therefore onewould falsely conclude that genetics played the major role, overlooking the overridingimportance of exposure to cigarette smoke. In areas with hyperendemic trachoma, noteveryone becomes blind; usually \"only\" end up with trichiasis and maybecome blind without further intervention, even though \"everyone\" will have beenTRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 3:02 PM Page 136have travelled to deeper tissues (397). Alternatively they may represent an artefact with tissuedistortion from scarring with epithelium seen indeeper sections. However, it seems to be universallyaccepted that chlamydial infection in trachoma isconfined to the epithelium. Universally serovars A, B, Ba and C of C. trachomatis are associated with trachoma, although usually one or two serovars will predominate in agiven endemic region (5,296) and in fact, in a given family (274,275). Only occasionally are otherserovars isolated and their significance is unclear(330,398) (see Table 7.1) (296). Immediately following infection with chlamydia, a mild acute inflammatory response starts that isinitially indistinguishable from that seen with otherinfectious causes of conjunctivitis. However , within days there is the increased accumulation oflymphocytes (32) which will go on to form thecharacteristic lymphoid follicles fully described first by Raehlmann (86). Between the follicles is a dense mantle of lymphocytes and an intenseinflammatory infiltrate (see Figure 7.3). W ith time, this infiltrate is replaced with fibrous tissue andscarring. The epithelium The epithelium over the follicles is thinned and heavily infiltrated with polymorphs andmononuclear cells (395). The epithelial cells areactivated to express both Class I majorhistocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens andClass II HLA-DR antigens on their surface(395,399). This activation can be induced byinterferon- and allows the epithelial cells to present chlamydia surface antigens and react withTh-1 T-cells. In in the epithelium In addition, theepithelium is infiltrated with macrophages in thesuperficial layers and dendritic cells in deeperlayers. Many lymphocytes are present in theepithelium (mainly T-cells), with more CD8 +T-cells than CD4+T helper cells, and a few B cells (395). Studies of infected epithelial cells in culture show that when infected cells lyse and release theinclusion with new EB they also release IL-1 (402). IL-1 then stimulates other cells to release the pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines PATHOGENESIS 139 exposed or infected as children. Is this genetic orenvironmental? If environmental, is this due to apersistent single infection or repeated reinfection? Indeveloped countries, blindness from chlamydialconjunctivitis (trachoma) is no longer seen, eventhough trachoma may have been a major problemin that population as recently as half a century or soearlier. Chlamydia infections are still prevalent and15% or 20% of young adults may have chlamydialgenital tract infection and therefore episodes ofinclusion conjunctivitis are not uncommon (seeFigure 7.1). Why do people become blind fromtrachoma in areas where reinfection can occuroften, but do not become blind from chlamydialinfection in areas where ocular reinfection is rare?The genetics of the population have not changed.Persistent infection could occur in either setting butthe occurrence of reinfection seems to be the key(see also chapter six). Clinically we have seen how trachoma can be characterised initially as a conjunctivitis (active oracute inflammatory trachoma) with follicles andpapillae associated with inflammatory thickening.This is followed by the development of cicatricialchanges with conjunctival scarring and distortionof the lid (cicatricial trachoma). The pathologic changes in trachoma reflect the clinical picture. In active trachoma inflammationoccurs in all layers of the conjunctiva with strikinglymphoid development connective tissue resulting in scarringand distortion of the eyelid. This chapter will first review the histopathologic changes and then explore the information that hascome from animal and human studies on thedisease mechanisms and processes involved. Insome ways the studies on whole animals, whetherhuman or experimental, look \"outside the blackbox\", studies of cellular and molecular events look\"inside the black box\". Histopathology The infection in trachoma occurs in theconjunctival epithelium; disease in trachomaoccurs in the subepithelial tissues. canbe easily demonstrated growing in the epithelium incytologic smears. However, intraepithelialinclusions can be surprisingly difficult to find invertical histologic sections through the epithelium,although they exist (395,396) (see Figure 7.2). Thisdifficulty is due in part to the multiplicity ofsectioned nuclei and the difficulty in differentiatingthese from sectioned inclusions. Rarely haschlamydia been reported were ingested in macrophages that138 TRACHOMA ABOVE Figure 7.1 The lid changes in acute inclusion conjunctivitis in a young adult in Melbourne.

These molecules attract inflammatory cells, especially macrophages, and initiate inflammatory cascade. Findings in monkeys are strikingly similar to those in humans (396) (see Figure 7.4).Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showsmarked of patchy lesions withdecreased microvilli and extruded lymphocytes canbe seen on the surface (see Figure 7.5). These areaslay over follicles where the epithelium is thinnedand infiltrated by plasma cells, eosinophiles anddegranulating mast cells. Away from the follicles,the epithelium becomes hypertrophic beneathwhich large numbers of subepithelial plasma cells,T-cells and a few macrophages exist. Similarchanges are seen in experimental animals andfurther studies confirmed the presence of anti-chlamydia specific IgM, IgG and IgA-producing B cells in and around the follicles (403). Theplasma cells are prominent subepithelially andmainly IgA producing, with lower numbers of IgGand much fewer IgM or IgE expressing cells (395).In human tissue T-cells are mainly CD4 +, although CD8+cells in \"quieter\" eyes (404). Interestingly, decreased bulbar conjunctival gobletcells were seen in children with PCR positiveinfection, this did not correlate hallmark of trachoma. In humans thesefollicles have a pale centre containing lymphocytes,plasma cells and macrophages in the centre as aclassical lymphoid germinal centre. Occasionalgiant cells may also be seen in the centre (395).These germinal centres are uncapsulated and aresimilar to Peyer's Patches in the intestine. They aresurrounded by a mantle of small lymphocytes thatare predominantly T-cells, but also include someplasma cells, macrophages and polymorphonuclearleukocytes.

Type V collagen appears in patches in theupper substantia propria and around blood vesselsand accessory lacrimal glands. It can also be seen inthe cytoplasm of fibroblasts. Type V collagen iseven more predominant in those with markedtarsal scarring (see Table 7.2). Macrophages seem to play a central role in the pathology of inflammation and scarring. Inactive trachoma, various inflammatory cytokinesreleased thesubstantia propria (401). Gelatinase B or matrixmetaloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) is also released bymacrophages and thus digests T ypes IV and V collagen, elastin and fibronectin (411). In addition,connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and basicFibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF) are released bymacrophages and can be found in high levels insubepithelial tissues in active trachoma (400).CTGF is profibrotic and stimulates fibroblasts,collagen and extracellular growth is increased under the epithelium andaround blood vessels. It controls cell migration andadhesion during embryogenesis and wound healing(see Table 7.3). Together these studies show trachoma is associated with intense inflammation and therecruitment and activation of many macrophages.These macrophages release a number of cytokinesthat have now been identified and can lead toformation of new collagen (especially Type V)leading to scarring and new blood vessel growth.The latter may help explain papillae formation onthe one hand and corneal pannus formation on the other (400). Changes in the cornea include oedema of the epithelium and underlying tissues, infiltration bypolymorphonuclear leukocytes and subsequentvascularisation and pannus formation (412). Limbal follicles form. Later , of course, corneal opacification and scarring can occur as a result oftrichiasis or as a consequence of microbial keratitis. It is important to remember the changes that can occur in the nasolacrimal duct with cicatrizationand dacrocystitis (413,414). Inclusions have specimens of the lacrimal sac(415). Punctal occlusion has also been described inPATHOGENESIS 143 cells (CD8+) rather than T helper (CD4+) cells (396,405) (see Figure 7.6). As the subepithelial tissues become more heavily infiltrated, the thickened conjunctiva shows anincreasing papillary appearance that includes boththe projection of papillae above the surface and thepresence of downward projecting epithelial crypts (32). The papillae contain numerous dilated blood vessels with prominent vascular endothelium andsurrounding inflammatory cells. There is a markedincrease in the number of goblet cells and denseinfiltration of plasma cells around the accessorylacrimal glands (395). At times, the crypts betweenthe papillae become blocked with debris and formpseudo-cysts (32). Ultimately these may form calcareous deposits seen as small concretions. Scarring Although fibroblastic changes may be seen in theearly stages of trachoma, these changes are mucheasier to see as intense inflammation decreases.This inflammatory process overlies a denseproliferation of connective tissue that eventuallyforms compact scar tissue covered by a thinflattened layer of epithelium (see Figure 7.7). The thickened, compact subepithelial fibrous membranebecomes adherent to the tarsal plate (406). The tarsus thickens and develops retention cysts,hyaline degeneration and focal replacement byadipose tissue (406,407). The deformedmeibomium glands atrophy and show thickening ofthe acinar basement membrane with a loss ofgoblet cells (408). Similar cicatricial changes have been seen in the monkey model (108). M arked inflammation persists in some people with a largenumber of CD4 +T helper cells (404,407). In uninflamed biopsies predominated. Although B cells are still present, germinal centresare not found and polymorphonuclear leukocytesare rare. In the normal conjunctiva, Types I and III collagen are found in the substantium propria andType IV collagen forms endothelium and the lacrimal gland(409). Type V collagen is not normally seen. Inactive trachoma, an increased deposit of Types I, IIIand IV collagen is found (409,410). The increaseddeposition of Type IV collagen and the new142 TRACHOMA Table 7.2: Summary of collagen I + + + +++ +++ + +++ + + + + + III + + + +++ +++ + +++ + + + + IV E + ++ ++ +++ VE + +++ ++ ++ LG + + + +++ V - - - +++ +++ ++ + + + +++ ++ +++ VK C endothelium LG and/or patchy discontinuous staining ++ thicker homogenous Tarsal and trichiasis. The concept of repeatedepisodes of reinfection predicts the cumulativedevelopment of increasingly severe cicatricialchanges that are dependent on the intensity andduration of exposure to infection and inducedinflammation. In either case, the response couldalso be tempered by genetic variation. The deterministic approach to progression still surfaces periodically and will be discussed in moredetail. This arises in discussions of the interactionbetween the presence of infection (NAAT test +)and clinical disease (233). The model put forwardis -),active trachoma or \"patent\" trachoma (infection +and disease +), and a recovery phase (infection - butdisease +). This simplified linear model not onlyoverlooks the occurrence of episodes of reinfectionand the periodic presence of infection, butoverlooks the possibility of the ongoing presence ofa chronic, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction tooccasional exposure to chlamydial antigens. clinical signs of activetrachoma, particularly follicles, may even years after \"infection\" has beeneliminated (196,221,227,233,235,236) . Immunopathogenesis Much of our understanding of the pathogenesis oftrachoma has developed from the notion thatdisease processes in trachoma result from theimmune response to chlamydial infection. ArtSilverstein drew attention to the likelihood that along-standing immunopathologic response gave aconsistent explanation of the pathogenesis oftrachoma: \"The subepithelial immune response isunable to clear the organism, so that the diseasecontinues for long periods of time in ever increasingseverity\" (417). We will come back to the questionof what maintains the ongoing presence of theorganism in the epithelium. Silverstein's five pointssupport the notion of immunopathogenesis (417): 1 Chlamydia are found only in the conjunctival epithelium. 2 The infection appears to be chronic and chlamydia are present for a long period of time.3 Chlamydia are not efficiently cleared by the host immune response. 4 The disease process is \"not marked by overt signs of epithelial cytopathogenecity by theorganism but rather by subepithelial conjunctivalinfiltrates of lymphocytes and plasma cells withthe formation of extensive lymphoid germinalcentres\". 5 The disease progresses towards corneal and the organism, onecan conceive of the persistent release of antigensfrom this organism into the subepithelial tissue,stimulating a long standing immunopathogenicresponse\" (417). Chan Dawson has also pondered over the problemsof the pathogenesis of trachoma keyquestions, \"How the chlamydial agent persistfor so long in the conjunctiva to cause prolongedand repeated bouts of inflammatory disease?\" and\"Why is the inflammation of the subconjunctivalconnective tissue, while in chlamydial infection,confined to the epithelium?\" (121). Most now accept of immuno- pathogenicity: \"Like other intracellular bacterialpathogens, chlamydiae possess little intrinsictoxicity and manifestations of disease appear toresult from immune recognition of chlamydialantigens\" (418). Even in the 1950s before chlamydia was isolated, the follicular reaction inthe subepithelial tissue was seen as an indirectresult of infection possibly induced by a toxinreleased by the \"virus\" (383). To better understand how the extraordinarily successful intracellular parasite C. trachomatis causes disease, we will turn to experimentalinfections in animal models and humans. Animal and human studies Animal models The earliest animal model of trachoma wasrecorded by Vetch in 1807 (16). He caught a dogafter he collected discharge from the eye of a soldierwith Egyptian ophthalmia. He then applied thedischarge \"to the eye of a dog, and so produced aPATHOGENESIS 145 association with trichiasis. Involvement of thelacrimal gland, dacryoadenitis, is also reportedfrom time to time (4,15). The histopathology of trachoma has been well described over the last 120 years (see summary byDuke-Elder, 1965) (412). The early writers were convinced of the occurrence and importance ofcentral necrosis of the follicles (4,32). \"Necrotic\"material could be expressed from inflamed lids, andthe expression of this was part of basic trachomatreatment dating back to ancient Greece. Thiscentral necrosis was not seen histopathologically . It was thought that \"The follicles either rupturedspontaneously ... or else gradually absorbed withor without the formation of scar tissue. Usually thenecrotic tissue is replaced by scar tissue whichinvades the follicles from without\" (32). This concept underlies the notion of the beneficialinduction of scarring as a way of reducing oreliminating harmful inflammation. This interestingthinking is the reverse of our current understandingwhereby development of scar tissue is a conse-quence of the ongoing presence (and severity) ofinflammation. The modern aim is to minimise (oravoid) inflammation and so reduce the likelihoodof scarring and its severity . The progression of disease The implicit understanding in all the earlydescriptions is that trachoma was a chronic diseaseand once acquired would proceed relentlesslythrough four stages (25) (see Figure 7.8). In fact,MacCallan postulated three outcomes of a follicle:\"a gradual change into tough connective tissuewith absorption of the contents\", \"rupture of thefollicle on its epithelial surface, evacuation of itscontents and cicatrization\" or \"furtherdevelopment of capsule, common cutting off ofblood supply and resulting necrosis of the contentsof the follicle\" (25). The last process led to posttrachomatous degeneration. However, some notedthe periodic nature of infection and the propensityfor relapse and occurrence of reinfection(91,315,316,416). The epidemiologic observationsthat indicate the importance of reinfection wereaddressed in some detail in the previous chapter. The concept of reinfection leads to significant changes in pathogenetic pathways that are likely tobe involved. Implicit in the deterministic orpersistent infection approach is the inevitable144 TRACHOMA Table CTGF + - bFGF -- + + - VEGF + + + + + - - CD105 -+ + - - Tenascin -- - + + No staining; +, weak staining; + +, intense staining; + + +, very intense staining.

Chlamydia was firstdemonstrated during the utans (142). Early on Nicolle, Cu\u00e9nod andothers in Tunisia undertook an impressive range ofstudies in chimpanzees, barbary apes and a range ofmonkeys (143). Other animals seemed to resistinfection, but monkeys became quite widely studied(155). MacCallan also describes some more unusualanimal studies in which different authors implantedtrachomatous material into the vitreous chamber ofrabbits and chickens with mixed results (4). Much valuable information has come from animal models. MacCallan considered \"theexperimental disease in monkeys is reallytrachoma\" (4). However , with characteristic bluntness Thygeson stated \"At the present time,conclusions based on monkey studies in trachomamust be confirmed by inoculation experiments inhuman volunteers\" (419). Thygeson consideredthat a single inoculation of infectious material inmonkeys \"bore little or no resemblance to humantrachoma\" because the infection was mild, did notinvolve the tarsal plate or cornea, failed to causescarring and invariably healed spontaneously.Thygeson conducted a number of human volunteerstudies that reflected quite different ethics inresearch at the time. One study in 1935 involved aone-eyed 50-year-old man who was inoculated inhis only seeing eye (150). The volunteer wasidentified in the acknowledgements and said to bein poor health. Several reviews have been written on the types and role of more recent animal models used tostudy chlamydial infection that have included mice,cats, guinea pigs and monkeys (420,421,422, 423,424). In selecting an animal model it is essential that the features or characteristics of both the animaland the infectious agent are relevant to theparticular question being addressed. W ith each host and agent there will be some properties orcharacteristics that are similar to the human diseasebeing studied, but other characteristics or responsesmay be quite different. Picking and interpretingwhich phenomenon is which is critical. Thisdistinction becomes increasingly important as moreis learnt about both the fine variation in theimmune response of different hosts, and subtledifferences between species and strains ofchlamydia. For example, studies of intravenousinjections of chlamydia in mice will involve a rangeof systemic immune responses that may be verydifferent from the mucosal immune responsesinvoked by infection confined to the ocular orgenital mucosal surface. Studies using invasivelymphogranuloma venereum strains capable ofgrowing in macrophages are likely to be verydifferent from studies of other strains of C. trachomatis confined to epithelial cells. Recent studies have shown significant differences insusceptibility to interferon- between the C. trachomatis mouse pneumonitis agent (now classified C. muridarum) and human ocular and genetic strains of C. trachomatis (425). Further work has shown enzymatic differences intryptophan metabolism between ocular and genitalstrains of C. trachomatis (426). Some host responses are quite different in different animals.Reflecting a certain degree of frustration, thecryptic comment has been made that \"the immuneresponse against C. trachomatis in humans is much more complex than in mice\" (427). Given these great variations, one should be cautious wheninterpreting the results of various animal modelsand extrapolating for human trachoma. Ideally , studies should use an ocular strain of C.trachomatis, and the only successful ocular hostsfor these strains are human and subhumanprimates. Although not practical for allexperimental work, ultimately key findingsprobably should be confirmed in a monkey model. Monkey models of trachoma: single infections The most consistent subhuman primate modelseems to be the cynomolgus monkey (Macacafasicularis) (see Figure 7.9). It is a better modelthan the rhesus monkey ( M. mulatta )(424). Other species studied in depth include the T aiwan monkey (M. cyclopsis ) (428) and the pig-tailed monkey (M. nemestrina )(429). In general, the inoculum used in monkey experiments is comparable to that used inhuman experiments and is of the order of a humaninfectious dose of 10 1or 102organisms (191,430, 431,432,433,434). This serves as a contrast tosome other animal models where infectious dosesof 10 6organisms or greater are frequently required.146 TRACHOMA Figure 7.9 The monkey model of trachoma (a) monkeys were housed in positive pressure isolation cages and anaesthetised prior to handling(b) an infectious inoculum of 20 microlitres was used.Typically, it contained about 10 3 EB (c) animals were examined with a handheld slit lamp. (a) (b) (c)TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 3:03 PM Page 146Response of monkeys to a single chlamydial infection It is hard to estimate how many hours of argument, pages of journals, or numbers of monkeys wereused from mid 1800 until the 1970s to resolve thedifference between inclusion conjunctivitis andtrachoma. A lot of this distinction became mootafter chlamydia was cultured, and as thinkingmoved from the deterministic model for trachomato a model driven by repeated reinfection. Before chlamydia could be cultured, the results of experimental infection were quite variable anddifficult to interpret. There were problems indetermining the inoculating dose of chlamydia. The ability to track the infection was greatlyhandicapped, relying solely on Giemsa cytology andthe clinical response. The sine qua non of clinical response was seen by some to be the development of cicatricial changes, especially corneal pannus.However, the ability to culture chlamydiarevolutionised the scope for animal studies. The response of na\u00efve animals to a single inoculum with C. trachomatis is quite consistent and leads to an acute self-limited episode of \"inclusion conjunctivitis\" (143,315,435,436,437, 438,439,440,441,442 ). Chlamydia can week of inoculation, and acute follicular conjunctivitis develops rapidly and resolves over athree to four month period (see Figure 7.10).Cultures become negative after about one month. If animals are rechallenged after recovery from primary infection they show some partialprotection. After secondary challenge they have an abbreviated infection which is less productiveand resolves more rapidly. This partial immunitygives some protection to higher inoculations (see Figure 7.11). Ocular infection is accompanied by the development of serovar-specific IgM and IgGantibodies in serum and IgM, IgG and IgA in tears(442) (see Figure 7.12). Subsequent studies showedthe tear antibodies to be specifically directedagainst the species-specific MOMP (443) andserovar-specific T and B cells were demonstrated inthe conjunctiva (403,444). The response was similar in monkeys given a single inoculation with the following ocular andgenital serovars A (HA 13), B (TW3 and HA 36), C(TW3) and E (BOUR) (445). Partial protection wasseen with rechallenge with the same serovar, butthe response to heterologous challenge was similarto a primary infection (315,445). The length of time after inoculation that chlamydia could be reisolated varied greatly withthe sensitivity of the laboratory test (446). Giemsacytology would be positive for three weeks, culturewith iodine stain for four weeks, culture usingmonoclonal immunofluorescence for six weeks,and DFA cytology for 10 weeks (see Figure 7.13).Later studies showed DNA PCR was positive for14 weeks while an RNA probe was still positive inseveral animals at 20 weeks (210). Quantitative tissue culture and DFA cytology (210) showed a marked reduction in shedding oforganism after secondary infection. Reisolation bytissue culture was delayed (first positive cultures attwo to three weeks instead of one week afterprimary infection) and shortened (those animalsthat were positive by culture were only positive forone to three weeks). The number of inclusion-forming units was reduced by one to two log units.Similar changes were seen with DFA cytology,DNA PCR and RNA blot testing. This is the samephenomenon observed in the field when attributedto a change in immunity to chlamydia because ofincreasing age (126). To explore the mechanisms involved in clearance of infection, a group of animals was givencyclosporin A to specifically block IL-2 function. 148 TRACHOMA Figure 7.12 Mean serotype-specific antibody levels in tears and serum of six cynomolgus monkeys receivingthree single inoculations of C. trachomatis BOUR strain 15 weeks apart (Taylor et al 1982 (442).Reprinted with permission from theAssociation for Research in Vision andOphthalmology, \u00a9 1982).

After challenge with an E serovar they developed chronic disease. Chlamydia couldbe cultured over a 10-year period and the monkeysdeveloped pannus, trichiasis and corneal opacity. Repeated reinfection and chronic disease So far we have reviewed the effect of singleepisodes of infection. In animal studies, theoccurrence of reinfection can be controlled in waysthat are not possible in the field. How doobservations from animal studies align with fieldobservations? Can they help to resolve the relativeimportance and occurrence of persistent infectionversus reinfection in trachoma? Relying on my field impression of the likely importance of repeated reinfections, I beganexperiments on cynamolgus monkeys at the Wilmer Institute. Animals were housed inindividual containment cages and inoculated once a week with an E serovar (BOUR) (108). As long as reinoculation continued, these animals had amarked, persistent follicular disease with largefollicles on their upper tarsus and a papillaryresponse with inflammatory thickening for as longas reinoculation continued (see Figure 7.14).Limbal follicles also developed, although cornealpannus was not evident. By nine months definitetarsal conjunctival scarring was present, bothclinically and histologically (see Figure 7.15).Chlamydia could be isolated by culture for the firstsix weeks and seen on Giemsa cytology for eightweeks. Animals showed a brisk IgM and IgG serumand tear antibody response that was serotypespecific. Biopsies confirmed epithelial changes withinfiltration of the disrupted epithelium, thedevelopment of follicles with germinal andan intense cellular infiltrate in the conjunctiva withlater scarring (see Figure 7.16). A number of subsequent studies were undertaken to further characterise and define thismonkey model of trachoma\u2014chronic (HAR-1)inoculation (442). The infecting chlamydia hadbeen grown in egg culture, but repeated inoculationof egg yolk did not induce similar disease (442),nor did formalin-killed elementary bodies (434).Ocular immune animals that had recovered from aprimary infection and were partially immune tohigh dose single challenge still developed chronicdisease with weekly reinfection (460). The presenceof partial ocular immunity was not sufficient toprotect against the development of chronic diseasewith repeated reinfection. For us, this modelled allthe important features of trachoma. Even though repeated reinoculation with live organism was needed to maintain chronic disease,the presence of the organism could not bedemonstrated after the first eight weeks or so. New,more sensitive tests such as DFA cytology and theuse of immunofluorescent antibody for cultureidentified lower levels of productive infection for alonger period, but after 10 weeks even DFAcytology became negative (446). Unfortunately atthat time NAAT testing was not available to testchronically reinoculated animals. In the 1950s topical corticosteroids were considered a \"provocative test\" for trachoma. undetectable chlamydial infection(419,461). Animals with chronic disease were givenremarkably large doses of dexamethazone (2mg)subconjunctivally every second day (462). Thisdramatically reduced the inflammation and by twoweeks the animals were essentially normal, bothclinically and histologically. Cultures and cytologyremained negative throughout. This at leastconfirmed the immune nature of the clinicaldisease. Steroid injections were given to a secondgroup of animals in whom repeated reinfection hadbeen stopped five months previously. They alsoremained culture and cytology negative. It is notclear whether the steroid reactivation test has anyclinical validity, but it certainly did not revealpersistent infection in this model. Bacterial cultures had been taken from animals with chronic disease, bacteria were rarely seen andcommon bacterial pathogens were not isolated(442). Animals with chronic disease wereinoculated with one of three common bacterialpathogens: Haemophilus aegyptius, H. influenzaeType B and Streptococcus pneumoniae Type 3. This did not produce any exacerbation of disease. Theseresults strongly suggested that bacterial infectionwas not necessary to produce active diseaseobserved in monkeys which could be explained bythe ongoing presence of chlamydia alone. However,This inhibited T helper cells and the primary B cellresponse. Treated animals had a prolonged primaryinfection, although it eventually cleared (447).After recovery, they responded normally to asubsequent secondary challenge. Cyclosporin A didnot alter the response to secondary challenge inocular immune animals. Infant pig-tailed monkeys developed acute self- limited inclusion conjunctivitis when infected withB or C serovars of C. trachomatis (448). When rechallenged three or four months later, theyshowed a more marked response with thedevelopment of follicles. It was unclear whethertheir increased responsiveness was related tofurther maturation of the animals or a heightenedresponse to reinfection. In general, children areunable to develop follicles before the age of three orfour months due to immaturity of their immunesystems (449). Dorothy Patton at the University of Washington in Seattle also developed the conjunctival pocketmodel which used subcutaneous implants ofconjunctiva in pig-tailed Theseimplants formed small cysts that could then beinoculated or infected with chlamydia. These \"eye\"pockets showed a similar response to infection andshowed worse disease with reinfection. Adultmonkeys, in fact, show partial protection to cervicalreinfection similar to that seen in the ocular model (451). Human volunteer studies \"Volunteers\" had been infected with purulentocular secretions since the early 1800s. Somestudies were quite heroic. For example, in 1956Tsutsui infected himself, three co-investigators,three nurses and his wife (452). After a period oftime they were treated with antibiotics, but Tsutsuireinoculated himself 11 times. These studies aresomewhat hard to interpret, although the authorsconclude that the immunity induced by a primaryinfection was not enough to give solid protection tosubsequent inoculation, and increasing the timebetween reinoculations increased the likelihood ofa more severe reaction. Tsutsui also noticed thatalthough one eye was infected, the infectionfrequently spread to the other eye. A new era of human volunteer studies started once chlamydia could be cultured. After a singleinoculation, most investigators reported that eyesbecame positive for chlamydia within two to 14days and cultures remained positive for five to sixweeks (148,431,453,454). Once a patient wastreated with antibiotic it took two to four monthsfor the clinical disease to resolve. A number ofinvestigators, particularly the San Francisco group,commented on the frequent development ofsuperficial punctate keratitis; pictures of which arestrongly reminiscent of adenoviralkeratoconjunctivitis, although a response toadenovirus was not demonstrated by serology(431,455). The time taken for symptoms to develop,but not the severity of symptoms, varied with thesize of the inoculum (431). After a single infectionnone of the 41 volunteers developed scarring. Some serovar-specific resistance was noted to reinfection (432,454). The response to serovar-specific rechallenge was more variable and gavemilder and short-lived disease. However, sometimesa hypersensitivity response was seen withrechallenge and corneal changes could be moremarked (455). Lymphadenopathy was reportedquite commonly in infected volunteers and 14%developed otitis media. In one volunteer, inclusionscould be found in fluids withdrawn from the ear(455). This latter finding must have relevance to thefrequent occurrence of otitis media in trachomaendemic areas such as outback Australia (456). Early studies show that some chlamydia produced a free toxin and Mitsui undertook aseries of quite heroic studies with two teenage boyswho were inoculated 36 times every 24 hours for18 and 28 days respectively (457). No significantdisease developed, and Mitsui concluded that a freetoxin was unlikely to be important in trachoma.This toxin is now known to be elaborated by C. muridarum, C. caviae and C. pecorum but not by C. trachomatis (266). Some studies gave unusual findings. Hanna recounts a blind volunteer who had been reinfected11 times over a five-year period (458). He had beenexposed to three different serovars, F, Ba and D,and inoculated with doses of up to 10 6 Egg Infective Doses50. After each infection, he was treated for eight weeks with systemic sulpha drugs and topicaltetracycline. This volunteer developed long-termpositive cytology, although chlamydia could not becultured, and he was presented as a case ofpersistent infection. This was similar to a report oftwo monkeys that had been variously infected and150 TRACHOMA PATHOGENESIS 151TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:52 PM Page 150Figure 7.14 The effect of repeated reinfection in the monkey model RIGHT clinical response seen to weekly reinoculation with C. trachomatis BOUR strain (E serotype), with mean positive chlamydial reisolationcultures.

When monkeys wereinoculated every day with the extract theydeveloped a marked response (see Figures 7.18,7.19). However, there was also a significant butmuch smaller response to the daily inoculation ofthe Triton buffer. Presumably there was sufficientdetergent remaining in this initial preparation sothe daily inoculation was like putting dilute soap inthe monkeys' eyes, although the single controlinoculation had no noticeable effect. Nevertheless,the difference between treated and control eyes wasstriking. Once the monkeys' eyes had settled, afurther single inoculation of the extract againproduced a marked response and again there wasno response to the buffer. The ocular inoculation ofTriton extract had no effect in na\u00efve animals (403).Subsequent experiments showed no ocular responseto the Hsp70 antigen in immune animals (469).The characteristics of the immune response inducedin the conjunctiva by the Triton extract was thesame as that seen with chlamydial infection(403,444). The Triton extract antigen wassubsequently identified to be the heat shock protein60 (Hsp60) and cloned (470). It is the second mostabundant protein in chlamydia. Skin testing of immune monkeys gave a marked positive response to MOMP and chlamydial LPS,but gave an even stronger response to the Tritonextract; two of the three monkeys that were testedwith the Triton extract developed areas of necrosis(468). Normal animals did not respond to skintesting with live or killed EB, the control Tritonbuffer or other antigens. These monkey experiments used an extracted antigen preparation with the potential for somecontamination with residual detergent. The studiesin guinea pigs were repeated with the recombinantHsp60 antigen and produced the same results asthose with the Triton extracted antigen (470). Morerecently, these results have been confirmed in studiesusing recombinant Hsp60 in the monkey pocketmodel with fallopian tubes only Hsp60induced delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. Wedid not repeat the monkey experiments with therecombinant antigen and no studies of this naturehave been carried out in humans. Chlamydial Hsp60 shows strong homology to the GroEL protein in E. coli and also with human heat shock proteins. Several authors havecommented on the homology and possibility ofdeveloping an autoimmune disease process inhumans (418,470), although later human studies ofthe immune response in trachoma showed noevidence to suggest the presence of an autoimmunein a cat model, more severe disease was producedwith the simultaneous inoculation of C. felis and a streptococcus species isolated from felinekeratoconjunctivitis, rather than inoculating eitherorganism on its own (420). A series of studies were undertaken to characterise the immune response in the monkeymodel. Repeated inoculation led to more severedisease with much heavier cellular infiltrate thatpersisted for as long as reinoculation continued(405). When reinfection was stopped, theinflammation resolved over some butreappeared when reinoculation restarted. As withsingle inoculation, the follicles trachomamodel contained B cells and serovar-specific IgAand IgG producing B cells that could be isolatedfrom the conjunctiva (403). Large numbers of T-cells were also seen, particularly between folliclesand beneath the epithelium. in vitro (403). T-cells did not respond to either purified MOMP or Hsp60. Thelatter was extracted with a Triton detergent andresidual traces may have influenced theseproliferation assays. These studies conclusively show that the monkey model of trachoma can be induced by weekly,repeated inoculation with live chlamydia, eventhough live chlamydia cannot be recovered fromthe eye after a period of time. If dead chlamydia areused or if reinoculation stops, the disease will waneand disappear within two to four months. Ifanimals are then rechallenged they will againbecome culture positive and develop clinicaldisease. The next challenge was to identify whatcomponent of viable chlamydia could cause thisimmunopathologic response. Purified antigen preparations The chlamydial genome codes for 894 proteins(272). However, immuno-blotting studies showthat only a small number of these proteins elicit animmune response (443). The major antibodyresponse is directed to the major outer membraneprotein (MOMP). This 39 kDa protein is thepredominant surface antigen and is used as thebasis for serotyping. MOMP accounts for almosttwo-thirds of the total protein mass of thechlamydial outer membrane. Antibodies to MOMPare neutralizing in vitro (179,463,464). Our studies also showed partial neutralisation in vivo in monkeys (465). Another immuno-dominant molecule is the chlamydial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Antibodiesagainst LPS are neither neutralising nor protective.Weaker bands are seen for proteins with molecularweights of 60 kDa and 68 kDa. These proteinshave been shown to represent the heat shockproteins Hsp60 and Hsp70 (see Figure 7.17). Inserum a weak response can also be seen to a 32kDa protein which has been shown to be an EBspecific DNA binding protein (HctB) (418). Thereis an additional 57 kDa chlamydial antigen, thecysteine-rich outer membrane protein (OMP-2).This protein is not exposed and does not generatean antibody response (418). Nancy Watkins with Harlan Caldwell used a weak detergent, Triton X-100, to extract an antigenfrom live chlamydia. When instilled into the eyes ofpreviously infected guinea pigs, this extractstimulated a marked inflammatory reaction (466).Animals that had been infected at distant sites, suchas the vagina or the gut, also showed a delayedhypersensitivity response when challenged in theeye with Triton extract. It was exciting to repeatthese experiments in monkeys (467). We tested the ability of a variety of antigen preparations to elicit an ocular inflammatoryresponse in immune animals by inoculatingdifferent antigens into the eye once a week and thenonce a day (468). Purified elementary bodiesinactivated with either formalin or UV irradiationproduced no response, nor did UV-irradiatedinfected tissue culture material. Dead elementarybodies did not induce a response. In an attempt toexplore the effect of live chlamydia without anestablished infection, animals were pre-treated withco-trimethoprim and while still receiving thisantibiotic they were given a single inoculation oflive EB under antibiotic cover. Only a minimalresponse was induced. The ocular instillation ofMOMP or purified chlamydial LPS did not induceinflammation, nor did the subconjunctival injectionof LPS (468). However, a single inoculation of Triton extract154 TRACHOMA Figure 7.17 Immunoblotting analyses of the temporal tear antibody response of cynomolgus monkeys with experimental C. trachomatis conjunctivitis.

Hsp60 can also induce an immediate or innate inflammatory response (473). From these experiments we concluded the presence of antibodies to Hsp60 in either tears orserum were not protective, but the exposure ofimmune animals to Hsp60 stimulated a tissueresponse indistinguishable from trachoma. Thisintense delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to achlamydial antigen was entirely consistent with thenotion that trachoma was a disease ofimmunopathology. This was further supported bythe resolution of inflammation with intense localsteroid treatment. Copious quantities of Hsp60 areproduced during chlamydial replication, butresidual Hsp60 is easily removed from the surfaceof elementary bodies in purified preparations.Hypersensitivity is the undesirable or damagingresponse of the presensitised immune system on re-exposure to a given antigen. These hypersensitivityresponses are grouped in four types (see Table 7.4). The concept of trachoma as a disease of delayed-type hypersensitivity totally changes one'sthinking about the interaction between infectionand disease. The classic example of delayed-typehypersensitivity taught in medical schools in the USand elsewhere is poison ivy. Almost everybody inAmerica seems to have had experience with poisonivy, poison sumac or poison oak and can relate tothis analogy very well. The same is true for othercontact allergies induced by plants or otherallergens. The mere touch of a leaf by somebodypreviously sensitised will lead to the developmentof a painful skin reaction within a day or so thatwill take one to three weeks to resolve. There aremarked skin changes in the absence of any antigen.The antigenic contact is fleeting and occurs days orweeks before the inflammatory reaction finallyresolves. If one tries to translate this concept to trachoma, one would only need to postulate the occasional,transient infection of a few epithelial cells withchlamydia to allow sufficient time for chlamydia toelaborate and release some Hsp60. It is quite clearthat partially immune animals (whether monkeysor humans) are still susceptible to reinfection, andonly short bursts of infection would generatesufficient Hsp60 to maintain active inflammation.To my mind, the analogy with poison ivy iscompelling. Another analogy would be the way inwhich the occasional, appropriately aimed andwell-timed tap with a stick will keep a hoop rollingalong more or less indefinitely, or until one getsbored. An important corollary is that the diseaseprocess is related to a cell-mediated immuneresponse. As far as pathogenesis is concerned, thepresence or absence of a humoral response seems tobe of little importance. Guinea pig inclusion conjunctivitis ( C. caviae) has been a useful model to study genital tractinfection. Guinea pigs received recurrentsubcutaneous immunisation with recombinantHsp60 with or significant serum and ocular IgG titreswhen the animals were challenged. After ocularchallenge, immunised animals had somewhat lesssevere disease, as measured by conjunctivalerythema, oedema and exudate, rather than anexacerbation of disease.

TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:53 PM Page 156in conjunctival scrapings and their response to further rechallenge was not altered. This studyshowed that immunisation with Hsp60 neithergives consistent or significant protection, nor in thepresence of infection did immunisation inducegreater disease. However, it did not assess whetherexposure of an immune animal to Hsp60 wouldinduce disease. Studies of Hsp60 in humans A number of serologic studies were undertaken toexamine the role of Hsp60 in human female genitaltract infection (see review by Brunham 418 and473). Both the prevalence of antibodies to Hsp60and their titre increased progressively in womenwith increasingly severe chlamydia pathology; thatis, comparing fertile women with serology to women with chlamydialcervicitis, women with chlamydial pelvicinflammatory disease and women with chlamydialtubal obstruction who had the highest titres (418).Brunham also noted that although many womenmay have developed chlamydial infection, only asubset developed severe disease, and he wonderedwhether the antibody response to the Hsp60 wasgenetically determined. Brunham suggested thepossibility of autoimmune inflammation as a resultof molecular mimicry. There were very few studies of human cell- mediated immunity to Hsp60. Women withsalpingitis had higher lymphoproliferativeresponses to Hsp60 (475). The longer women wereexposed to chlamydia, the more severe theirdisease, and the greater their cellular response toHsp60. In women with STD, the presence of serumantibodies was not linked with a CMI response toeither EB or Hsp60, but women who had cell-mediated immunity to Hsp60 were stronglyprotected against incident infection (476). Anotherstudy reported increased responsiveness to Hsp60in women with tubal factor infertility and suggestedthat this response was regulated by HLA-D2 andIL-10 genes (477). Hsp60 will stimulate CD4 +T helper cells in vitro (478,479), and cytokines released by Th-1 cells such as interferon- play an important role in protection. Hsp60 from C.pneumoniae is also thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis (480). What do we know about the role of Hsp60 in causing damage in human trachoma? A study usingaffinity purified Hsp60 showed no increase inproliferative responses in Gambian children withactive trachoma, but significantly increasedresponses in those who had recovered from activedisease (481). The responses to MOMP showed asimilar pattern. Further studies also showedperipheral blood cells in people with scarring (TS)when exposed to Hsp60 responded Th-2cells and their cytokines are associated withfibrosis, a finding that further supports the role ofHsp60-driven fibrosis. A correlation has been found between the presence of trachomatous scarring (TS) andincreased levels of Hsp60 antibodies (483). Thosewith doubled their risk of TS but only32% with TS had Hsp60 antibodies. However , there was a poor correlation between serologicresponse and cell-mediated immunity to Hsp60(476). The importance of a delayed-typehypersensitivity reaction to Hsp60 in humans with trachoma awaits further testing, but current data are either supportive or they do not refute it. At the molecular level, the story of chlamydial Hsp60 became more complex as three homologuesof Hsp60 have been identified (484). ChlamydialHsp show strong similarities to bacterial andmammalian heat shock proteins such as GroELfrom E. coli. They belong to a group ofchaperonins that form heptameric rings with otherchaperonins. These proteins are responsible for thefolding and refolding of proteins and their correctdelivery into assembling cell membranes. It appearsthat the second homologue of Hsp60 has a relativeinhibitory effect to the function of the first, and istherefore produced in increased quantitites duringpersistent or non-productive growth by IFN- (485,486,487). 158 TRACHOMA Cells and cytokines So far we have looked at the pathogenesis oftrachoma from a relatively broad perspective, butwe will now look inside the \"black box\" andexamine some of the cellular and molecular eventsdescribed to date. This is a rapidly evolving fieldand the development of new technology can lead torapid advances in knowledge. There is a currentand broad review of this in a recent textbook (488). As mentioned, the interpretation of animal data is fraught with difficulty in relating changes in oneinfection/host model system to another due todifferences between different chlamydia (theirsensitivity to interferon (IFN- ), for example), the site of inoculation (superficial mucosal or systemic)and the animal host (human, subhuman primate,mouse or guinea pig). In animal studies, the timingand frequency of ocular challenge is controlled, buthuman studies in the field cannot control forreinfection. The latter also suffers from difficultiesin disease definition; people with mild but definiteand unequivocal active trachoma may be classifiedas not having \"active trachoma\" (TF/TI or F 2/P3) and regarded as \"normal\". The detection ofinfection will vary with the type of test (PCR, LCRor EIA) and the handling of specimens. Despite allthese difficulties some very interesting andimportant advances in our understanding havebeen made over the last 10 years or so. Human trachoma is almost invariably caused by serovars A, B, Ba or C (296). Although there isregional variation as to which serovarspredominate, only these four \"ocular strains\" areassociated with trachoma. Harlan Caldwell andhis group have shown that there is a specificbiochemical difference between ocular and genitalstrains of C. trachomatis (426). As we will see, one of the key responses to chlamydial infection is theproduction of IFN- (489). IFN- induces the expression of indoleamine-2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO).IDO in turn depletes intracellular levels oftryptophan, essential the metabolism ofchlamydia. The genomes of ocular and genitalstrains share 99.6% identity and the area that isnot identical is known as the plasticity zone (268),which codes for tryptophan biosynthesis, toxinproduction and purine metabolism. As it turns out,the genital strains are able to encode for tryptophansynthetase, but this gene is mutant in the ocularstrains. Having this functional enzyme enables thegenital strains to use indole to escapefrom inhibitory effects of IFN- . It has been postulated that the bacterial flora in the genitaltract produce sufficient levels of indole to providethis exogenous supply (273,426). Although bacteria are present in even the normal conjunctiva, they are present in vastlysmaller numbers than in the heavily colonisedgenital tract. There would seem to be insufficientocular bacterial flora to generate sufficient indole.Without this mechanism it is unclear as to how theocular strains cope with the relative depletion oftryptophan, or how this process may interact withproductivity or persistence of ocular infection.Tears do not provide a source of tryptophan eitheras tryptophan is not found in human tears(490,491). The inflammatory response in active trachoma has multiple components: one stimulatesinflammation, another damps down inflammationand third stimulates fibrosis and scar formation(see Figures 7.20, 7.21). An extensive series of studies including those using specific genetically modified \"knockoutmice\" have shown the importance of Type 1 Thelper cells (Th-1) or a pro-inflammatory responsein TNFand other cytokines. They involved in delayed-typehypersensitivity. Conversely, Type 2 T helper cells(Th-2) are thought to have contributed to thedisease resolution and were considered to be anti-inflammatory, although scarring and \"repair\" arepart of the process of the resolution ofinflammation (493). Th-2 cells release IL-4, IL-5and IL-I3 and other cytokines. They also stimulateB cells and antibody production. Studies inTanzania and The Gambia have shown thepresence of mediators released by Th-1 and Th-2cells as part of a pro-inflammatory delayed-typehypersensitivity the conjunctiva ofchildren with active trachoma (494,495). Burtonconcluded that the presence of active disease isassociated with the expression of pro-inflammatorycytokines (IL1/TNF ), noted PM Page 158\"back-lash\" (IL10) and evidence of changes in the regulation of the extra cellular matrix withincreased MMP9. In cases with active chlamydialinfection, an activated cell mediated immuneresponse produces IL12, IFN and perforin. This suggests the occurrence of down regulation of thecell mediated response with the clearance ofinfection. Cytokines were at their highest levels inchildren with intense trachoma (TI) and in thosewith the highest loads of infection. They were alsoelevated in adults with TS. Bobo postulated thatlevels of mediators may be high in those who wereunable to control high levels of infection and wouldtherefore develop more severe disease (494).Gambian children who recovered from infection,for example, had higher levels of cell-mediatedimmunity to chlamydial antigens (481). These pro-inflammatory cytokines can lead to activation of the epithelium as mentioned above andthe expression of matrix metallo proteins (MMP)\u2014enzymes released to digest collagen and otherproteins and ground substance that formsconnective tissue. Specifically activated was MMP-9(411,495) which degrades the extracellular matrix,especially basement membrane (Type IV collagen),and facilitates the migration of cells includingpolymorphs and fibroblasts (473). MMP-9 can alsoactivate TGF and so promote the formation of scar tissue and increases 10 fold in children with intenseinflammatory trachoma (P 3) (496) . Th-2 cytokines that have an immune regulatory and/or anti-inflammatory role are also released,specifically IL-10 (495). In mice IL-10 is thought tobe predominantly released by T regulator (orsuppressor) cells (493). IL-10 limits IFN- production and tissue damage caused by pro-inflammatory Th-1 mediators, but may also impedethe effective clearance of infection. IL-10 normallysuppresses collagen synthesis and scar formation(493). A specific genetic change in the IL-10haplotype in some people was associated with anincreased risk of scarring and trichiasis (320,497).Similar findings come from genital tract infection(477). People with this apparently less active IL-10haplotype expressed higher levels of IL-10 duringinfection, and this may alter their subsequent riskfor developing scarring (498). Why their risk wasincreased, however, is unclear. In knockout mice,the absence of IL-10 enhanced the clearance ofchlamydia, but also increased the severity ofinflammation (499). More needs to be writtenabout this complex interaction. The expression of different cytokines changes with the evolution of active trachoma. IL-1 , IL-10, TNF and MMP-9 active trachoma; whereas IFN-, IL-4, IL-12p40 and perforin were increased in children with demonstrable infection (495,500).IL-4 is expressed by Th-2 cells, other T helper cells,natural killer (NK) cells and mast cells. IL-4 may beindicative of damaging inflammation. In mousemodels IL-13, also released by Th-2 cells, may beresponsible for more fibrosis than IL-4 (493). IL-12is released by dendritic cells and macrophages. Itdrives Th-1 cells and the production of IFN- . Perforin is indicative of the presence of CD8 + cytotoxic T-cells. IFN-is a key molecule in the inflammatory response to chlamydia and has the direct effect ofimpeding chlamydial development by limitingtryptophan availability. In in vitro studies this leads to laboratory defined \"persistent infection\" or non-productive infection (489). Cultured chlamydia canbe kept in the equivalent of suspended animationuntil tryptophan levels are restored. In thelaboratory this state can be maintained for about30 days with care. This is as long as the infectedcell cultures remain viable. During this time,ribosomal assembly is blocked and the productionof chlamydial antigens such MOMP stops,although the production augmented(478,485,501). Hsp60 can detected in persistentC. pneumoniae found in atheromatous plaques (480,502). In trachoma areas, high levels of IFN- and IDO were evident in the conjunctival scrapingsof those who were infected, whether they hadclinical disease or not (503). IL-10 was also high inthose who had both clinical disease and infection.These data suggest that the increasing antigen loadstimulates high levels of IFN- that eventually leads to the control of infection with a balancing IL-10response to reduce inflammation (503).Alternatively, chlamydia could evade the IFN- /IDO pathway and continue to grow despite highlevels of the cytokines. It is still unclear whatmechanisms ocular serovars use to cope withPATHOGENESIS 161 Figure 7.20 All arms of the adaptive immune system help to control Chlamydia infection. (1) Professional antigen presenting cells (pAPC) process and present Chlamydia antigen on their cell surface in complex with MHC class I and II molecules. When antigen-specific CD4+T cells recognise MHC class II: foreign peptide complexes at the surface of pAPC, these T cells become activated. (2) Effector CD4+T cells produce cytokines, especially IFN-, which help to control Chlamydia infection. Not only does IFN- stimulate the bactericidal activity of macrophages, but it also helps to reduce replication of Chlamydia, presumably by depriving the organism of tryptophan and iron. (3) Activated CD4+T cells can also direct the activities of B cells and CD8+T cells. A subset of circulating B cells express antigen receptor molecules that recognise surfacecomponents of the Chlamydia elementary body (EB). This subset of B cells becomes activated by effector CD4 +T cells to proliferate and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. These secretedantibodies bind EBs and prevent them from infecting host epithelial cells ina process termed \"neutralisation\". Additionally, through a mechanismknown as \"oposonisation\", antibody binding of EBs facilitates the uptakeand destruction of organisms by pAPC. (4) Via their T cell receptors,CD8 +T cells recognise Chlamydia peptides complexed with MHC class I molecules. However, in order to become fully activated, antigen-specificCD8 +T cells often require \"help\" from CD4+T cells. Once activated, effector CD8+T cells that recognise Chlamydia-infected cells will respond by secreting the inflammatory cytokine IFN- , which helps to control Chlamydia infection. (5) Upon recognition of a Chlamydia-infected cell, it is also possible that effector CD8+T cells directly lyse the host cell and its intracellular niche (Balsara ZR, Starnbach Press Starnbach).Figure 7.21 Opposing roles for TH1 and TH2 (IFN-) directly suppresses collagen synthesis by fibroblasts. It achieves this through regulating the balance of matrixmetalloproteinase (MMP) and tissue inhibitor of matrixmetalloproteinase (TIMP) expression, thereby controlling therates of collagen degradation and synthesis, respectively, in theextracellular matrix. IFN- and/or interleukin-12 (IL-12) might also indirectly inhibit fibrosis by reducing pro-fibroticexpression by T H2 cells. The main TH2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13) enhance collagen deposition by various mechanisms;however, IL-13 seems to be the crucial mediator (Wynn 2004(493). Reprinted with permission from Macmillan PublishersLtd: Nature Reviews Immunology, \u00a9 2004).TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:53 PM Page 160increased the risk of CO more than twofold, and the risk of total CO more than sixfold (513). Many have stressed the importance of ongoing inflammation as a risk factor for the developmentof trichiasis, often associated with bacterialinfection (407,509,510). Pathogenic bacteria aremuch more commonly isolated from those withtrichiasis (106,514). Anyone examining peoplewith trichiasis is familiar with the discharge socommonly seen. In addition, about half of thosewith trichiasis have significant tarsal inflammation.More recently in those people with trichiasis who also have bacterial infection) (515). The relevance of persistence: infection versus reinfection How does this information further our understanding of the pathogenesis of trachoma andthe relative importance or contribution ofreinfection compared to persistent infection? It is quite clear that animals (human and experimental animals) that have recovered from achlamydial infection remain susceptible tosecondary challenge infections, even though theymay show partial resistance or immunity comparedto na\u00efve subjects. With secondary challenge, theduration of clinical disease and chlamydialshedding (infectious load) is reduced. This patternwas characterised almost 100 years ago by Nicolle(143) and 30 years ago by Grayston (288) andobserved in detailed longitudinal studies (126).Grayston first drew attention to the importance ofreinfection (315). Bailey attributed the decreasedduration of infection in older people to a changedimmunity relative to ageing, rather than an age-related change in exposure to reinfection. Thehighest load of infection is seen in the youngestchildren (122,168,298) and they also have thepoorest facial hygiene and ocular promiscuity. Theyare at maximum risk of reinfection, and it wouldseem that the apparent longer duration of infectionseen in children, may well represent the effect ofmultiple episodes of re-exposure/reinfection ratherthan a true immunologic difference. Observations of the kinetics of infection aretryptophan deficiency induced by IFN- and IDO (273). Once infection cleared but clinical diseasepersisted (resolving disease), the levels of a Tregulatory cell (T R) marker FOXP3 were elevated (503). TRcells are thought to limit and encourage repair. Holland used some clever new technology to detect antigen specific CD8+T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood (319). HLA peptide tetramers toepitopes of chlamydial MOMP were used to identifyHLA I restricted CD8 +cells present in low numbers in peripheral blood. They were related to thepresence of infection but not related to the load orresolution of infection, development of new infectionor the presence of clinically active trachoma. Thesignificance of these findings is still to be determined.Human T-cell clones can recognise surface exposedchlamydial antigens (504). As mentioned previously, Th-2 cells have been linked to the production of scarring. Both MOMPand recombinant Hsp60 stimulate cells to produceIFN-from normal control subjects and those with trachoma (482). However, Hsp60 also stimulatedcells from patients with trachoma scarring (TS) toproduce IL-4 and increased amounts of both IL-10and IFN- (482). An association with TS and HLA DR (Class II) histocompatibility antigens was notseen by Holland (482) or Conway (505), althoughConway did find an association with increasedscarring and Class I HLA *6802. A subsequentstudy of adults from The Gambia showed anincreased response to Hsp60 by those with HLADRB1*0701 and a decreased response with bothDQB1*0301 and DQB1*0501 (506). A study inOmanis with blinding trachoma showedsusceptibility and was linked to the presence ofHLA-DR16 (a in the genital tract causing tubalinfertility (477). With studies such as these chancefindings are possible and associations requireconfirmation. However, they open the door tofurther studies of differences in geneticsusceptibility as do studies of IL-10 haplotypes. Holland demonstrated that low levels of circulating CD8 +cells also recognise both MOMP and Hsp60 (472). He could find no evidence forautoimmunity. The antigen specific CD8 +cellsseemed to have little role in the inhibition of localinfection. His group postulated that changes in thebalance T and cells,both cytotoxic CD8 +cells and Th-1 and Th-2 cells, may lead to chronic infection (505). Ultimately, this complex inflammatory soup of T-cell cytokines from the cell mediated immuneresponse controls the recruitment and activation ofmacrophages and fibroblasts (493). As previouslymentioned, there is strong evidence for the ongoingactivity of macrophages and deposition of newcollagen by fibroblasts which forms the scars werecognise clinically and distort the tarsus to causetrichiasis and blindness. Progression of cicatricial changes from scarring to trichiasis As previously mentioned, the presence of severe inflammation is a clear risk factor for thedevelopment of scarring (138,322). Dawsonobserved that \"children with severe or moderatedisease develop sufficient scarring by the age of 15to make blindness an inevitable consequence for atleast some of them\" (138). Negrel has been evenmore succinct: \"scars today, trichiasis tomorrow\"(53) (see Figure 7.22). There is variation in the rate of progression from scarring (TS) to trichiasis (TT) with estimatesranging between 2% and 7% per year (323,508,509). The level of endemicity may also influencethese rates. The two Gambian studies showedapproximately one-third of those with minortrichiasis developed major trichiasis within four or10 years. In Tanzania, the five year incidence fortrichiasis varied with age and gender and rangedbetween 3.2% in women with TS (aged 15 to 19years), to 15.1% in women with TS (aged 55 to 59years) (510). The presence of chlamydia detected byPCR doubled the risk of developing trichiasis (511).Once trichiasis was present, up to 40% of olderwomen developed corneal opacity (CO) within 10years (510). The four year incidence of CO in TheGambia was 5% for those with minor trichiasis and10% with major trichiasis (509). Significantly, therisk of CO was increased eight times if TT waspresent (512). An important study in Ethiopiashowed that having trichiasis for two or more years162 TRACHOMA PATHOGENESIS 163 Figure 7.22 Early onset of cicatricial trachoma TOP a teenage Tunisian boy who already has CENTRE severe scarring and BOTTOM trichiasis. TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:53 PM Page 162clinical disease is maintained or slowly resolves (233). Implicit in this linear model is the concept ofa single defining episode of infection. If one is toentertain the possibility of reinfection, one needs tobreak the patent and recovery periods into a seriesof alternating episodes of ongoing clinical diseasewith the intermittent presence of infection. Further,one could suggest episodes of infection sufficient torelease Hsp60 to stimulate cell-mediated immuneresponse. Therefore we can deduce that in trachoma it is not the infection that causes blindness, but theinflammation. It is important to remember that asthe prevalence of trachoma decreases, the first thingto be reduced is the intensity of infection andinflammation; the second is the incidence; and thelast is the prevalence of follicles or active disease. Ifone considers trachoma as a chronic, delayed-typehypersensitivity with subsequent fibrosis, one alsoneeds to remember that only the occasionalexposure to antigen may be enough to sustain theongoing clinical disease. PATHOGENESIS 165 164 TRACHOMA thwarted by the infrequent examination interval ofmost field studies typically at two, six or 12months. We conducted a study with three monthlyexaminations (195); Bailey examined people everytwo weeks (126) and in her impressive work inTanzania, Bobo collected weekly specimens (124).However, even this may be too infrequent.Immediately replicated PCR swabs may have a 5%variation and a 1% false positive rate (217) andDFA smears taken every two days may show a25% discordance (195). Is this artefact or is it realvariation in shedding? The ability to finally resolve the importance of reinfection in trachoma areas will require muchmore careful field studies with more frequentexamination, stringent attention to the possibilityof sample contamination, and the use of the mostsensitive tests for both the detection of infectionand importantly measurement of clinical disease.For programmatic control activities, the outcomemay not be critical\u2014trachoma may disappearbefore this conundrum is finally resolved. However,for those attempting to develop computer modelsof trachoma, it is a central and critical issue (516). It seems apparent that instances of persistent infection of chlamydia may occur at leastoccasionally. It is important to differentiate thelaboratory term \"persistent infection\" from theclinical concept \"continuing infection\". we know that chlamydia can be held insuspended animation for several weeks instead ofcompleting their life cycle within two to four days.Persistent or continuing infection in humans relatesto either the ongoing presence of infection (monthsor years) after notionally effective antibiotictreatment, or the prolonged presence ofdemonstrable organism in the absence of exposureto reinfection. Prolonged infection has been observed in infants infected at birth, who have persistent chlamydialinfection of the eye and nasopharynx over twoyears (517). Cervical infection in women has beenreported to last for two to five years despite varioustreatments, although the possibility of multipleepisodes of reinfection cannot be excluded (518).Without treatment 54% of women with cervicitisare clear of infection within one year and 94%within four years (519). Another study foundpersistent infection in 8% of women withchlamydial cervicitis who had been treated anddenied having sexual contact (520). This suggestsprimary treatment failure with ongoing infection.Women whose partners had not been treated had a25% rate of infection, suggesting the occurrence ofreinfection. It has also been suggested thatpersistent C. trachomatis infection may be important in arthritis (521), and persistent C. pneumoniae infection may occur in atheroma (502) and possibly even in age-related maculardegeneration (522,523,524,525). An examination of naturally occurring infections in animals does not resolve this issue. Certainly thevast majority of infections in animals with C. psittaci, C. abortus and C. suis are asymptomatic (260). It is unknown whether these common,unapparent endemic infections result from slowhost elimination of infection (or persistence) orfrom reinfection. Information about trachoma is less clear, and certainly no study has been able to control for thepossibility of reinfection. Ongoing or \"persistent\"infection is commonly seen after antibiotictreatment especially with community-based studiesof azithromycin. These studies have not treated theyoungest children in the first few months of life andmany have not treated any children under 12months. These little children are known to have thehighest levels of infections and will remain assources of reinfection. The rate of return ofinfection after azithromycin treatment in Ethiopiais an astounding 12.3% per month (526). Persistent infection was suggested in Tanzania when half the women with infection at two PCRtests taken three years apart had either no infectedchildren or no children (323). These women mayhave had persistent infection, but without controlsfor specimen collection and more detailedbehavioural information, the possibility of artefactor reinfection cannot be excluded. As discussed, Tom Lietman and his group have reintroduced discussion about the concept of thelatent period of infection where infection is presentand the eye is normal; the period of clinically activetrachoma with the presence of infection (the\"patent\" period); and a recovery phase wheninfection can no longer be demonstrated, but TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:53 PM Page 164167 THE IDENTIFICATION OF chlamydia by Giemsa cytology and confirmation that trachoma resulted from infection opened the way for the first trachoma vaccine studies. This was a path previously followed for other infectious diseases. Chlamydia were identified in 1907 by Halberstaedter and von Prowazek (142). In the same year Nicolle and his group in Tunis began their experimental studies (143) inoculatinghuman volunteers and a range of subhuman primates including chimpanzees, various apesand monkeys. They confirmed the infectious nature of trachoma and noted that onceanimals had recovered from a single infection they were relatively resistant to infection butcould be reinfected. As previously mentioned (see chapter four) Nicolle's group confirmedthat trachoma should be classified as a virus because it was small enough to pass throughthe pores of a Berkefeld V filter and the \"virus\" was destroyed by heating it to 50 \u00b0C for 30 minutes or by drying on cloth for one hour at 32 \u00b0C. The virus could be stored for one week in glycerine. They then initiated a series of quite extraordinary vaccine studies using subconjunctival or intravenous injections of filtered material collected from conjunctival scrapings of patientswith trachoma (143). These studies were undertaken in humans and monkeys and vaccines gave variable and inconclusive results. They must have experienced great difficulties instandardising immunising doses and the infectious challenges. They noted some resistanceto rechallenge suggesting immunity in some cases but in others, the response to rechallengeled to worse disease, a finding frequently reconfirmed over the next 100 years.CHAPTER EIGHT Trachoma vaccine development The possibility of making with the trachoma agent a preventive and therapeutic vaccine was contemplated in 1960 when the problems connected with the isolation and the cultivation of the agent were solved GIAMBATTISTA BIETTI , 1967TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:53 PM Page 166Freund's adjuvant) caused considerable reactions to the booster injection (533). More immunisedchildren developed trachoma at two and a half years than placebo children. The Seattle group also conducted a trial in the Punjab assessing a very high dose bivalentformalin-killed vaccine (>10 9 EB) (534) administered to 450 children aged three months tofive years who did not have trachoma. Boosterinjections were given approximately three monthslater. At one year, vaccinated children hadapproximately half the incidence of trachoma.When followed up at 12 years, there was nodifference between vaccinated and placebo groups(535). Significantly, vaccinated children had notdeveloped more severe disease. At that timeGrayston predicted the future \"hope for the controlof trachoma would seem to lie in the explosiveadvances being made in immunology\" (536). The third major group working on a trachoma vaccine was the Boston group who worked withAramco in Saudi Arabia. In the laboratory theymainly studied owl monkeys (Aotus trivirgatus), anew world monkey that had a more florid responseto chlamydial eye infection (439). Animals againshowed a short-lived, partial resistance to reinfectionthat correlated with the presence of tear and serumantibodies (537). A major vaccine trial assessed abivalent vaccine in children under the age of threeyears. Although there was less clinical disease at sixmonths, the effect was reduced at 12 months anddisappeared by 18 months (538). However, childrenwho had received the higher dose aqueous vaccinewere three times more likely to develop clinicaldisease than those in the control group. The Italian group working in Ethiopia initially studied Grivet monkeys (Cercopithaecusgriseoviridis) and undertook a series of vaccinestudies evaluating alum orincomplete Freund's adjuvants. They amonovalent formalin-killed vaccine with 5 x 10 8 EB; half this dose was given as a booster at sixweeks (539). Between 1960 and 1962 threeseparate studies in several thousand childrenshowed this vaccine could prevent the acquisitionof new infection. The vaccine also showed atherapeutic effect as it \"hastened healing\" andsubsequently more vaccinated children moved fromactive trachoma (Stages II or III) to inactive (StageIV) disease with scarring. In these double-maskedstudies, the rate of development of new disease washalved with vaccination and about twice as manyvaccinated children showed a therapeutic benefit. In 1964 Bietti conducted a large field trial vaccinating 5000 children with the same number ofchildren as controls. This was the first of Bietti'strials to use computer analysis. At 12 months, lessvaccinated children had acquired trachoma andmore had resolved. Summarising his experience,Bietti noted that the preventive benefit of thevaccine lasts for approximately one year, whereasthe therapeutic effect could be observed at threeyears. The effects were more marked in childrenover the age of six and in areas with mild trachomaor where a large number of children wereimmunised. Each of these could be an indicator ofareas where trachoma might decrease because ofsecular changes. Bietti noticed no gender differenceand the vaccine was more effective in Grade IIdisease and had no effect in Grade III disease. Based on these findings, a commercial vaccine was developed with approval from the ItalianMinistry of Health. Bietti considered the vaccinewould be useful for several purposes: it wouldprevent infection in those entering the endemicareas such as expatriates; it could be used withantibiotic treatment to shorten the duration ofdisease; it could be used to prevent reinfection inthose already cured; and to protect the very youngfrom developing infection. Bietti found nosustained benefit by combining vaccination withtreatment with oral sulphonamides (539). Similarfindings also came from Taiwan (540). Bietti diedsometime after this and although commercialquantities of his vaccine were made, it was neverreally taken up because the vaccine was onlypartially effective. After about 15 years, the intense interest and activity in a trachoma vaccine ran out of steam. Avaccine could produce partial, short-termprotection both in experimental infections and inthe field. The protection in either subhumanprimates or human volunteers was comparable tothat seen after the recovery from a primary ocularinfection. In some instances, immunised individualsdeveloped more severe disease. As mentioned, acommercial vaccine had been developed, but wasnot used. TRACHOMA VACCINE DEVELOPMENT 169 There seemed to be little further work on vaccine development between the two world wars,although a lot of experimental work wasundertaken in both humans and subhumanprimates to identify and culture chlamydia (46). MacCallan opined that in humans: \"There is absolutely no immunity against reinfection by the virus of trachoma for an individual who hasapparently recovered from the disease. [However]when ... the normal epithelium has been replaced byscar tissue epithelium and a delicate layer of cicatricialtissue has been laid down beneath the epithelium of themajor part of the conjunctival extant, reinfection israre\" (4). Early vaccine studies The isolation of chlamydia in 1957 spurred another burst of interest in a trachoma vaccine. The abilityto culture chlamydia improved the quality ofresearch by several orders of magnitude. It wasnow possible to determine and quantify the size ofimmunising doses, infectious challenges and theinfectious load recovered after ocular challenge.The availability of organism made it possible todevelop antibody assays and it became possible totrack serum and tear antibody responses and afterthe introduction of microIF in 1967, to serotypedifferent strains and determine the serovar-specificity of antibody responses. In the 1960s four major groups worked on trachoma vaccine development; Leslie Collier'sLondon-based group working in The Gambia, TomGrayston's Seattle-based group in Taiwan, RogerNichols' Boston-based group in Saudi Arabia andGiambattista Bietti's Rome-based group inEthiopia. Each conducted initial studies insubhuman primates and undertook clinical trials ofvarying size. Small trials were also performed inSouth Africa (527). The Italian studies led to thefull-scale commercial production of a vaccine. The London group in the Medical Research Council Trachoma Unit studied baboonsimmunised with a so-called \"fast strain\" ofchlamydia, and subsequently this strain was shownto be LGV. They used live vaccine and showedpartial resistance of baboons to rechallenge for twoto six months (528). Some studies used intravenousimmunisation but this led to the widespreaddissemination of live LGV agent, particularly in thelymph nodes and spleen (529). Three human trialswere undertaken in The Gambia, but results werenot clear-cut, showing neither a protective northerapeutic effect (170,530). A further trial testingboth live and formalin-killed bivalent vaccines(with a total of 3.7 x 10 6or 4.3 x 108organisms) was undertaken by this group in Iran. Thesevaccines were given intramuscularly with a boostertwo weeks later. They showed a mild transientreduction of infection at one year, but had no effectat two years. \"This short-lived, moderatelybeneficial effect of trachoma vaccines is, however,not sufficient to be of practical value\" (91). The Seattle group worked at the Naval Medical Research Unit No 2 (NAMRU 2) in Taiwan.Extensive studies in the Taiwan monkey ( M. cyclopsis ) showed the development of partial protection after primary infection andimmunisation (315). Formalin-killed EB were usedand vaccines of high titre (10 9 organisms) gave some initial protection, although this protectiondecreased by nine months and had disappeared bytwo years (531). However, lower-dose vaccines (5 x10 7) did not protect consistently and the monkeys that became infected developed more severedisease. Partial protection was serotype-specific,although there was some cross reactivity related tothe evolutionary cascade of chlamydial antigenicchanges in MOMP, the so-called senior and juniorantigens (531). Animals that had a hypersensitivityreaction to challenge infection developed pannusand scarring was observed. Grayston also notedthat the hypersensitivity and increased disease withrechallenge lasted longer than the partial protection(316). This was a particularly significant findingthat clouded the future use of trachoma vaccines. Several vaccine trials were carried out in Taiwan that had a clever design. The youngest siblings offirst grade schoolchildren with active trachoma wereimmunised with a purified vaccine (532). An alumadjuvant was used. Although the results at one yearshowed a reduced incidence, any protection haddisappeared by two to three years and no protectionwas seen at six years. In those who received themonovalent vaccine infections were more severe andoccurred more frequently (316). Another trial with100 children using an oil adjuvant (incomplete168 TRACHOMATRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:53 PM Page 168IgM, with and B cells conjunctival T-cells.

The results of these studies were disappointing andfailed to induce immunity better than that seenfollowing recovery from a primary ocular infection(see Figure 8.1). They emphasise the imperative ofcomparing the of immunised animals withthe response of \"naturally immune\" animalsreceiving secondary challenge. Naturally immuneanimals have recovered from a primary infection.These vaccine trials did not lead to examples ofworsening of disease.170 TRACHOMA Monkey experiments with purified vaccines The vaccines studied in the 1950s, 1960s and early1970s used whole elementary bodies. With thedevelopment of the monkey model of trachoma atJohns Hopkins, we had the opportunity throughthe 1980s to examine the role of a number ofpurified antigen preparations that becameavailable. Also we were able to examine theimmune response of immunised and challengedanimals with much greater precision, and followthe antibody response and the development of cell-mediated immunity both systemically and locally.The various vaccine approaches for immunisingantigens are summarised in Table 8.1. These extensive studies showed:\u007f none of the immunising regimes or vaccines that were tested gave better protection than thatseen after recovery from a single, primary ocular infection \u007f immunisation immunisation gave good serum antibody titres, usually did not give tear antibodytitres.

Reprinted with permission from the Association forResearch in Vision and Ophthalmology, \u00a9 1988).TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:53 PM Page 170MOMP vaccines despite evidence of good priming, it is unlikely that conformational or adjuvantadjustments (546,547) will make the quantumchange in protection required for an effective anduseful vaccine. Anti-MOMP-specific antibody canbe neutralising in vitro. In tissue culture systems when one needs centrifugation and the use of highmolecular compounds to make EB attach to cells,an antibody that attaches to the surface of thechlamydia may provide sufficient non-specificinterference to block this artificial cell attachment.In vivo studies in animals suffer a similar problem when relatively huge titres of antibodies can beused to neutralise purified elementary bodies priorto inoculation. Clearly in both humans and animalsthe presence of tear antibodies against a range ofchlamydial antigens including MOMP does notprevent infection or even the culture and re-isolation of viable organism. However, the presenceof tear antibodies may control the shedding ofinfection and reduce the titres of organism that arerecoverable in culture. Another antigen currently being studied is the polymorphic membrane protein D (PmpD)(548,549). This cleaved protein is highly conservedand surface exposed. It seems to be morespecifically involved with the attachment ofchlamydia than MOMP and antibodies to PmpDcan be neutralising (267). This makes it anattractive vaccine. Attention is also being directedto the immunity-related guanosine triphosphatases(IRG or p47 GTPases). These involved in the intracellular control ofintracellular pathogens such as tuberculosis (550)and chlamydia (551). Another vaccine candidatecould be attachment targets for chlamydia andType III Secretion System (552,553). A wide range of adjuvants is now available and it may be possible to deliver chlamydial vaccinesthat are much better targeted and so induce a morespecific immune response (543,546,547). Based onthe cytokine studies, a vaccine should aim to inducea strong Th-1 response and reduce or minimise theTh-2 response. Toll-like receptors (TLR) arepathogen-recognition receptors antigens T-cells. Vaccines thatstimulate TLR signalling may be more effectivealthough this is not yet well established (554). So far we have examined the role of a protective vaccine. I do not see how a therapeutic vaccine assuch is likely to help. These vaccines were trialledby Bietti and based on the concept of an ongoingchronic disease following a single episode ofinfection. However, another approach would be tolook at a tolerising vaccine that reduced the hostimmune response to deleterious chlamydialantigens. Immune tolerance is a concept that hasbeen studied for 40 years, especially in tissuetransplantation, but is still not fully understood.However, if the hypothesis that trachoma is ahypersensitivity response to the Hsp60 antigenwere correct, in theory a vaccine that specificallydown-regulated this response should reduce theseverity and intensity of disease. However, a morepragmatic approach in the foreseeable future is thepublic health approach embodied in the SAFEStrategy outlined in the following chapter. Thisoffers a more likely way to eliminate blindness dueto trachoma than the development of a vaccine. TRACHOMA VACCINE DEVELOPMENT 173 Current status and future developments It is important to remember that vaccines againstchlamydia are widely and effectively used inveterinary practice (260). These vaccines against C. psittaci , C. abortus and C. cati contain either live or killed whole EB. The fact that whole EB vaccinesin animals are successful when they were clearlynot effective against trachoma, show majordifferences must exist in immune mechanisms thatoperate in different situations. With the explosion in tools and reagents available for cellular and molecular studies andgenetic manipulation, the mouse has become theprime experimental animal for chlamydial research(423). Mice are easy to handle, cheap, and inbredstrains can be studied in large numbers and providea good model to study genital tract infections(541). Although some work in mouse models hasused human pathogens that was initially classified as C. trachomatis , but has subsequently been reclassified as C. muridarum. MoPn can cause respiratory infection when inoculated intranasally, or genitaltract infection can occur in female animals aftertreatment with high doses of progesterone. Thesetwo model infections have been used extensivelyand have advanced our understanding of theresponse to chlamydial infection in many ways. However, when extrapolating these findings for human trachoma, one has to recognise that MoPndiffers significantly from human ocular strains ofC. trachomatis . For example, MoPn is quite different in its response to IFN- and the reduction in available tryptophan (273,544). There are alsosignificant differences between human and mouseimmune responses. Newer techniques allow us todissect the immune response in even greater detailand characterise finer components. This makeseven subtle differences between infective organismsand host responses potentially more significant. Anexample would be a study in women with tubalinfertility where the Th-2 response was found to beas important as the Th-1 response (427). Theauthors observe \"the results also suggest that theimmune response against C. trachomatis in humans is much more complex than in mice, where a strongTh-1 response correlates with the elimination ofbacteria and resolution of disease\". Most recent studies in the mouse model have looked at the mechanisms of systemic immunityrather than mucosal immunity. Systemicmechanisms are strongly involved in the lunginfection model. The salpingitis model also inducesstrong systemic immune response. This focus isunderstandable as much of the drive for achlamydial vaccine comes from STD andrespiratory fields. Trachoma on the other hand isan infection confined to the mucosal surface andsignificant differences exist between the systemicand mucosal immune responses. Given the necessary caution when extrapolating findings from the mouse model to humantrachoma, studies both in mouse and humansindicate the importance of a strong Th-1 responsein the resolution of infection (492,494,495).Darville recently reviewed this field summarising alarge number of experiments including those inknock out mice and other mouse models thatdemonstrate the importance of the Th-1 response(544). These findings are also consistent with thestudies of cytokine expression in humans(494,495). Genetic factors that regulate theinduction and activation of Th-1 cells and perhapsIL-10 producing T regulatory cells may beimportant in directing human immunity towardsprotection or pathology (498,544). A CD8 +T-cell response seems to be less important in protecting against infection both inthe mouse model and in humans, although the role of these cells in clearing human infection is lessclear-cut. Cloned human CD8 +cells found in the blood of people with trachoma (319) are capable of recognising chlamydial outer membranecomplexes on the surface of infected cells (504). The relevance of antibodies in protecting againstsecondary infection is quite unclear (476,482,503)although in the mouse model antibodies play animportant role (545). It would take a braver man than I to look into the crystal ball and predict the successfuldevelopment of a vaccine to control blindingtrachoma before 2020. Although MOMP may bethe immunodominant antigen and antibodiesagainst it are neutralising, it seems most unlikelythat an effective MOMP-directed vaccine could bedeveloped. After all the negative results with172 TRACHOMATRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:53 PM Page 172175Past treatments THEEBERS ' PAPYRUS (1553-1550 BC) was basically a collection of ancient Egyptian prescriptions of which about 70 were for the treatment of eye disease. Much Egyptian medicine was based on topical treatment; a variety of animal, vegetable and mineralproducts were applied to the eye, often with the feather of a vulture. The Greeks had a different notion of disease. They related most disease to humoral causes and so treatments were used to divert inflammation from the affected eye to other organs.By and large topical medications were not favoured. Hippocrates and the Greek physiciansin the fourth century BCadvocated curing ocular disease by drinking wine, bathing, purging, bloodletting, and with cleansing medications. Three types of operations were used to treattrachoma: the scarification of the granular conjunctiva or ophthalmoxysis by a variety ofmeans followed by the application of copper compounds such as copper oxide and coppersulphate (Discordes 60 AD, Celsus 43 AD); the surgical excision of the fleshy granular tissue in thickened lids, followed by cautery with a heated iron and copper treatment; and varioussurgical methods to correct entropion and trichiasis. These principles were subsequently followed by Greek and Roman practitioners (10), taken up by Byzantine and Arabic physicians and passed back again into western Europeanmedicine in the Middle Ages. These principles formed the basis of the treatment of trachomauntil the introduction of the first effective antimicrobials\u2014the sulphonamides\u2014in 1937. CHAPTER NINE Trachoma control and the SAFE Strategy Drugs? I'd prescribe water. If governments were to put water on nobody would have trachoma! IDAMANN , 1966 TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:53 PM Page 174Certainly for millennia copper sulphate and silver nitrate were the standard worldwide treatment including China (8), Egypt (12), Europe (4,29,46) and the USA (130). Cautery or bloodletting was also advocated to reduceinflammation (see Figure 9.1). An analysis oftraditional medicines used in Egypt in the 1980sshowed many of the compounds listed in Ebers'papyrus were still in regular use (12). Itineranthealers in the Middle East also continued toperform traditional lid surgery (see Figure 9.2).However, surgical interventions were lessemphasised and almost forgotten by Europeanwriters until the early 1800s when army surgeonswere confronted by troops with the Egyptianophthalmia. Tarsal excision became quite popularand was widely practised for a time. For example,it was the recommended treatment in the US intothe 1920s with disastrous results (74). Irradiationwith X-rays and radium was tried with limitedsuccess in the London Trachoma Schools at the end of the 19th century (30). The Greco-Roman medical management we have inherited has three pillars: surgery, medicines,and lifestyle and diet. These components bear astriking similarity to the elements of the currentSAFE Strategy. Now our approach to trachomacontrol is based on the notion of repeated episodesof reinfection and the need to use multiple interven-tions to break the vicious cycle (see Figure 9.3). Sulphonamides and tetracyclines Sulphonamide drugs were the first effectiveantimicrobial agents and they became available in1937 and were rapidly used to treat trachoma.Their use in England is said to have led to theclosure of the British Trachoma Schools in 1944(65). In Egypt their use in the treatment of selectchildren was found to be disappointing having littleimpact on trachoma, although corneal ulcerationrapidly responded to treatment (300). In 1949Lindner wrote \"A few years ago trachoma was one of the most serious diseases of the eye. Thatthis is no longer the case is due to thesulfonamides\" (560). In Indian reservations in the south-west of the United States they replaced the use of topicalcopper sulphate, and when used to treat the wholecommunity, they led to a marked reduction intrachoma (79). Their distribution was stoppedwhen the USA entered the Second World War in1942 as drugs were requisitioned for military use(see chapter two and Figure 2.15). A rebound intrachoma in Indian communities was noticed in the1950s (359) and a new program began in 1967(79). All school-age children were examined andany found to have trachoma and their familymembers were treated with triple sulphas for 21days (561). Those who were sensitive to sulphas (orsulfas in America) were treated with topicaltetracycline. Rates in schoolchildren were reportedto be as high as 74%. A nurse also made homevisits and gave further hygiene education. Improveddistribution of drugs, examination of allcommunity members and significant improvementsin housing led to an accelerated reduction (80). Theprevalence of trachoma in people of all ages fellfrom 16% to 7% in just three years, and furtherdropped to 3% by 1976, and the program wasstopped in 1985 when prevalence was less than 1% (398). In 1944 Father Frank Flynn, an Australian ophthalmologist and army chaplain in CentralAustralia during the Second World War, treatedpeople living in at least five Aboriginalcommunities in Central Australia with oralsulphanilamide he had requisitioned from armystores (562). Having done this once without properauthority it seems he was unable to convince theauthorities to provide more of this precious drug.After the war, he conducted large scale treatmentwith oral sulphas administered for two weeks withvariable results (383). Following the surveys of Ida Mann in Western Australia and the identification of trachoma inAboriginal people, all Aboriginal children weretreated with sulphadimidine in 1959 (563). Thenext year there were only a few cases of trachoma.Following a high rate of side effects with longeracting sulpha drugs used in 1961 and 1962,targeted treatment continued in 1963 and 1964 but enthusiasm had waned: The reason for the lack of success in controlling trachoma is, in my opinion, that we have expected toomuch from drugs alone. We have relied on tediously176 TRACHOMA Figure 9.2 Traditional surgery to correct trichiasis as performed in Oman ABOVE LEFT the lax eyelid skin was tented upwards with a large pair of forceps ABOVE RIGHT a split stick was then tied over the \"redundant\" skin causing pressure necrosis and so shortening of the anterior lamellar of the lid (courtesy, Mark Reacher). RIGHT Figure 9.1 Burns applied to the forehead and temples of a Tanzanianchild to treat trachoma follows thetraditional treatment first set out byHippocrates (1990).TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:53 PM Page 176long courses of not very efficient drugs while next to nothing has been done to improve the nativeenvironment which, with its overcrowding, dirt andflies and absence of personal hygiene remains ideal forspreading the disease (563). However, sulphas continued to be widely used in Australia. In 1972 Hollows treated all the membersof an Aboriginal community over the age of sixweeks for one month with oral co-trimethoxazol(103). Two months later there was a markedreduction in the amount of inflammation and atthree years active trachoma had dropped from 75%to 5% and residual cases had minor follicles only. Based on this experience, Hollows and the NTEHP used co-trimethoxazol for their massivetreatment campaigns (103). A total of 25,000people over the age of three months were treated infour large programs. The average dose distributedwas 26 out of 40 possible doses, with the targetbeing twice daily doses for 20 days. The poorestcompliance was amongst 20 to 40 year old men.Side effects occurred in about 5%; three-quarters of which were mild, the most common beingnausea and vomiting or a rash. Over 2000 childrenwere re-examined between six to 12 months posttreatment. There was a 48% reduction in theoverall prevalence of active trachoma in childrenfrom 52% to 27% and an 80% reduction in severe disease. Commenting on theseinterventions, Hollows considered antibiotictreatment to be an interim measure until adequatehome health hardware became available (318)(see Figures 9.4, 9.5). The mass distribution of oral sulphas was also one of the key components to the elimination oftrachoma in Malta (343). Extensive studies withoral sulphas were also undertaken in Ethiopiaincluding the use of lower doses of long-actingdrugs administered every second week (539). Thistreatment was still troubled by recurrent episodesof infection. The use of topical sulphas was associated with frequent allergic reactions. The new antibiotictetracycline, first discovered in 1945, was effectiveagainst chlamydia and well tolerated when appliedto the eye. In Pakistan topical treatment with silvernitrate, copper sulphate, sulphacetamide,chloramphenicol, three tetracyclines and threecombination treatments of antibiotic and curettagewere compared (564). The best results wereachieved with tetracycline ointment combined withcurettage and copper sulphate which gave a 55%cure at six months. A large study in South Africainvolved some 10,000 children in 36 schools whowere treated with a range of topical medicationthat included sulphacetamide, tetracyclines,neosporin and steroids (565). Only childrenattending school were treated. No difference wasobserved between the various antibiotics and at sixor 12 months trachoma rates were reduced byabout 25%. The addition of steroids did not seemto enhance or impede antibiotic treatment. A studyin China found topical tetracycline to be superiorto copper sulphate and although oral sulphas werehelpful with acute treatment, they were not neededfor long-term control (158). Dawson undertook two studies in Tunisia comparing topical tetracycline, topicalerythromycin and boric acid as a control. The first 178 TRACHOMA Areas of mass systemic trachoma treatment programs 1976-1977-1978 Figure 9.4 Community-wide treatment was given on a large scale during the NTEHP (1977) (a) aboriginal health workers assembling for atraining course in Alice Springs(b) Fred Hollows and a Pintupi elder (whose firstencounter with Europeans was less than 10 yearsbefore) during the training session(c) teams of medical students and Aboriginal healthworkers arriving at a community with three weekssupply of drugs(d) Septrin suspension given to a young girl.Figure 9.5 Area covered by mass antibiotic treatmentduring the NTEHP (NTEHP1980 (103); courtesy, RoyalAustralian and New ZealandCollege of Ophthalmologists).

There was a tendency for relapse at 12 months. The results aredifficult to interpret as the MacCallan grading was used, but an overall cure rate of about 35%was recorded. The intermittent schedule wasrecommended as it was as effective and consideredmore practical. Primary schoolteachers assistedwith the treatment of schoolchildren. Antibiotictreatment campaigns were also linked with healtheducation activities that included village meetings,leaflets, posters and the screening of a special film\"Trachoma\". Impressive work was reported from southern Morocco where Reinhards compared intermittenttreatment using tetracycline ointment twice a dayfor three days each month for six months usingoral treatment with triple sulphas administeredover four days (139). The impact of fly suppressionand the combination of different modalities as wellas untreated control villages were assessed.Extensive studies were conducted in three areasover a 10 year period. The copious amounts ofdata are again difficult to interpret, in part becauseof the use of the MacCallan grading, and in partbecause of the lack of computing power to producethe multivariant analyses that have now becomestandard. Overall, Reinhards found no benefit fortrachoma from fly control alone although flycontrol did reduce the amount of bacterialconjunctivitis (381). Only a small benefit wasobserved with the addition of oral sulphas totopical tetracycline therapy (139). Reinhardsobserved that intermittent treatment delayed theonset of infection and reduced both the intensityand gravity of infection. One outcome measure wasthe age at which cicatrization was first observed;this was used as an indicator that active trachomawas resolving. In one study this had decreased fromeight to three years\u2014a significant improvement.The onset of active trachoma was also markedlydelayed from three months to three years.Attention was drawn to the difficulty of treatinginfants, although treatment \"has not immediatelybeen sufficiently directed towards the infants andyoung children\" (139). This 10 year study alsoshowed that treatment needed to be repeated eachyear \"for many years\". Although initially topicaltetracycline had been distributed to families eachmonth, in the second year of the program, familieswere given a supply at the start of each summerand subsidised ointment was also made available inlocal tobacco shops. The report from Morocco was the largest and most detailed of the WHO studies, but in 1976Yuri Maitchouk summarised the experience withtopical tetracycline treatment in 15 countries in theEastern Mediterranean Region (569). Differentintermittent treatment regimes had been usedincluding once daily for six consecutive days eachmonth for six months, once daily for two weekseach month for three months, one or twice dailyfor five days for six months, or once daily for 10days for six months. All had an equal therapeuticresult and the particular regime seems to have beendetermined by local considerations. However, after10 years of treatment in the Sudan, for example,the rate of active trachoma in children under theage of 10 had fallen from approximately 60% toless than 10%. Severe trachoma had almostdisappeared from Syria with three years oftreatment and bacterial conjunctivitis was greatlyreduced in several study areas. Similar results withtopical tetracycline were reported in Ethiopia (570).One community health worker was assigned totreat 25 to 30 people and in one year there was a 45% reduction in severe active disease. As an alternative to topical tetracycline, studies were conducted with oral doxycycline, a long-acting tetracycline. In Iran, Jones conducteda community-based study distributing doxycyclinetwice a week for three weeks and the rate ofmoderate and severe active trachoma was halved at two years (571,572). Again using family-basedtreatment, a study in Palestine found that oraldoxycycline was as effective as tetracycline or oral sulphas and all gave an 80% cure at one year(573). Hollows and the NTEHP used community-based distribution of oral doxycycline to treat trachomain one Aboriginal community . A dose of 100mg was administered three times a day for two weeksto capitalise on the ability of higher doses ofdoxycycline to also treat holoendemic syphilis. Thisunpublished study was inconclusive due to poorcompliance. Many suffered gastrointestinalcomplaints as the morning dose almost universallywas taken on an empty stomach. A single oral dose of doxycycline administeredTRACHOMA CONTROL AND THE SAFE STRATEGY 181 study used daily treatment for 60 days in six tonine year olds. Although the antibiotic reducedbacterial colonisation and suppressed chlamydialinfection, no difference was observed at fourmonths between the three groups which all showeda reduction in trachoma (566). The second studyused intermittent treatment applied twice daily forfive consecutive days each month for six months(567). Again, no difference was observed andtrachoma decreased and then rebounded in bothgroups. A further study in American Indian highschool children compared oral tetracycline for three weeks and a placebo (568). A dramatic fall in infection was noted with immunofluorescentcytology in both groups. The intensity ofinflammation rapidly reduced, but follicles changedmore slowly. These temporal changes mirror thoseseen today with azithromycin. In 1952, the WHO recommended topical tetracycline four times a day for two months andoral sulphas were administered for two months(20). If the disease had not resolved, tetracyclinewas to be continued, and the three-week course ofsulpha treatment was to be repeated on two orthree occasions as necessary. Silver nitrate andcopper sulphate were still advocated for selectedcases. The recommended frequency of topicaltetracycline was reduced to twice a day in 1956(33) (see Figure 9.6). In 1962 erythromycin wasalso suggested as an alternative and the intermittentuse of topical tetracycline for three to six days aweek each month for six months was advocated(49). The assessment of the impact of treatmentshould be delayed for at least three or possibly sixmonths after the cessation of treatment. The WHO had supported major trachoma control activities in countries such as India,Pakistan, Burma, Morocco and Egypt. Theintermittent topical tetracycline schedule was alsotested in India (302). Overall, each treatment wasmore effective when given under supervision. Betterresults were noted at six months in older people 180 TRACHOMA Figure 9.6 Topical tetracycline has been one of the mainstays of trachoma control for 50 years (Tanzania and Burma 1986)(a) being applied by healthworkers(b) & (c) more commonly, tubes are normallygiven to children with the expectation theywill be used properly.(a) (b) (c)TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:54 PM Page 180isolated chlamydia. In 1964 he estimated that the prevalence of trachoma in China was 50%. Eye health promotion campaigns \"anticonjunctivitis fortnight\" (Quinzaine ANTI-RMAD) were held in Tunisia prior to the annualepidemic (52). They focused on simple hygienemethods and used a variety of media and schoolprograms. Intermittent tetracycline was latercombined with health education and the provisionof trichiasis surgery (577). Subsidised ointment wasalso made locally available. Over a 20 year period,in 13 of 18 governances, the prevalence oftrachoma in five to seven year olds had droppedfrom an average of 24% to 1.4%. In Australia, three small studies combined bathing at school with antibiotic treatment usingoral sulphas and topical tetracycline (578), topicaltetracycline (579) and co-trimethoxozol (365). Thelatter two showed a reduction in trachoma at oneyear of more than 50%, but none were sustained. In 1973, the WHO published Field Methods for the Control of Trachoma (102) that dwelt on the role of antibiotics, but also outlined the importanceof trichiasis surgery, training the health cadre andthe need to promote health education. It mentionedthe role of education of school-age children, andthe delivery of messages in maternal and childhealth clinics. Only a few examples of the areas tobe covered under health education were given, butpersonal hygiene and the provision of water wereincluded. The WHO also published an updated Guide to Trachoma Control in 1981 (107) setting out seven elements that should be included in programs tocontrol trachoma: 1 Assessment of the problem and establishment of priorities. 2 Allocation of resources. 3 Chemotherapeutic intervention.4 Surgical intervention to correct lid deformities.5 Training and utilisation of local health aids and other non-specialised health workers. 6 Health education and community participation. 7 Evaluation of intervention programs.Elements 1, 2, 6 and 7 really dealt with process issues. The chemotherapy recommended was eithersix weeks of topical tetracycline ointment or one oftwo variations of the intermittent schedule (eithertwice daily for five days or once daily for 10 dayseach month for six months and repeated asrequired). Alternatives included oral tetracyclinesor doxycycline for three to four weeks or the use oforal sulphonamides for two to three weeks.Erythromycin was given as a further alternative.For the correction of trichiasis, epilation,electrolysis and cryotherapy were suggested andeight different operations were recommended forentropion and trichiasis. The recommendations on health education were of a high level and quite general. Mothers of youngchildren were identified as the prime target forhealth education which emphasised the provisionof water, the reduction of crowding and theTRACHOMA CONTROL AND THE SAFE STRATEGY 183 once a day for two or three weeks was a viablealternative to the prolonged and difficult treatmentprogram required with intermittent topicaltetracycline (574). When Schachter and Dawsonbalanced the cost benefit advantages of thereduction of the likeliness of blindness against theside effects of oral doxycycline (dental changes,long bone deposition and photosensitisation), theyconcluded that doxycycline \"iswarranted for treatment of in children\" (574). When the prevalenceof active trachoma had dropped below 20%, forexample, they suggested it would be cost-effectiveto give doxycycline to all children with moderate or severe disease (575) (see Figure 9.7). Some clinical trials were also conducted with rifampicin (105,576). However, they were only moderately successful and this important drug forthe treatment of tuberculosis was not widely usedto treat trachoma. Trachoma control programs I have thus far concentrated on the assessment ofantimicrobial agents. Usually, although not always,antimicrobial treatment was combined with otherhealth intervention measures (20,52). In 1952 theWHO recommended that control activities shouldfocus on both the disease itself and the associatedepidemic bacterial conjunctivitis. This involved (i) case finding and treatment, (ii) health education,and (iii) the destruction of possible vectors togetherwith environmental sanitation measures (see Figure9.8). There was a need to emphasise prevention.Health education programs, for example, might useteachers and other measures. A vertical program toinitiate trachoma control would be needed for atleast two years and thereafter yearly follow-up tomaintain control. The successful model developedin Egypt by MacCallan was taken as the prototype(52) with a central national institute to co-ordinateactivities of static and mobile eye hospitals. It usedteams of nurses and doctors and had activeprograms in schools and in the media. Interestingly,the group reiterated that in Tunisia (with apopulation of 3.8 million people) 20 millionworking days were lost a year through trachomaand they used this as an argument for action (52). In 1956, the WHO Expert Committee emphasised the need for preliminary epidemiologicinformation; the conduct of pilot studies, thedesirability of mass campaigns as a way of reducingcosts; further cost reduction through co-ordinationwith other programs and the use of \"lay people\";and the ultimate integration of the program ofnormal activities of public health services (33). These messages were very much taken to heart in China during the Great Leap Forward whereProfessor Chang listed the five ways in whichtrachoma programs had been incorporated into thepatriotic health movement (158). First, the health system in the people's commune provided thefoundation for anti-trachoma work. Second, the\"Four Combinations\" provided the principles foranti-trachoma work: (i) closely combined with thehealth movement, (ii) education to improvepersonal hygiene, (iii) health linked to increasedproduction and (iv) the combination of traditionaland modern therapies. Third, the training of cadresto increase numbers of anti-trachoma personnelwas needed. Fourth, education propagandatogether with the patriotic health movementprovided the knowledge of prevention andtreatment of trachoma to the people (via films,radio broadcasts, television, newspapers, etc.). Eachperson was to have their own washing towel andwash their face and hands with running water.Fifth, continuing scientific research consideredessential for anti-trachoma work. Chang spokewith authority as one of the group that had first182 TRACHOMA Figure 9.7 The dental changes associated with use of oral tetracyclines in childhood. Figure 9.8 A poster advocating fly control and hygiene in Egypt from the 1960s (\u00a9 WHO, reproduced with permission).TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:54 PM Page 182identification and control of breeding sites of eye- seeking flies. The improvement of personal hygieneshould be actively encouraged and assisted.Movies, schoolchildren and teachers were allsuggested as a means of delivering the message.These were somewhat diffuse and ephemeralrecommendations for a trachoma control programand with the exception of a few countries such asBurma, Thailand, Tunisia, USSR and Vietnam (54),little programmatic trachoma activity continued onan organised national basis (see Figure 9.9). The observations of the importance of facial cleanliness in the 1980s led to calls for moretargeted trachoma intervention programs thatfocused on a more specific \"motivational message\"(388). The need for such programs to be sustainedand long term required appropriate sociomedicalresearch within the community (368,580). Othersalso recognised that the widespread use ofantimicrobial agents on their own would notreduce endemic disease in the absence ofsocioeconomic improvement or behaviouralchanges (581).The SAFE Strategy In the early 1990s, a number of factors werecoming together. Since 1985 the Edna McConnellClark Foundation, a New York-based philanthropicorganisation, had provided support for newtrachoma research (582). Epidemiologic studies had identified specific risk factors; new diagnostictests were being used; clinical trials had assessedtrichiasis surgery and facial cleanliness; and studiesof new antibiotics, especially azithromycin, were inprogress. This collective activity and progress led toa resurgence of interest in trachoma similar to thatseen in the 1810s, 1910s, 1930s and 1960s. In 1993 a new field guide was developed by the WHO called Achieving Community Support forT rachoma Control, a Guide for District Health Work (583) which became known as the \"green book\". This guide brought together the results of recently completed controlled clinical trials ontrichiasis surgery and facial cleanliness. It built onthe WHO Simplified Grading for T rachoma (128), the recently released publication Final AssessmentTRACHOMA CONTROL AND THE SAFE STRATEGY 185 Figure 9.9 Trachoma control activities.

In addition, the WHO Alliance for the Global Elimination of Blinding Trachoma was establishedto oversee this ambitious program that becameknown by its own acronym, GET 2020. Since1997, the Alliance has met annually. It includescountry representatives, NGOs, WHO staff andother experts in the field. With representatives fromPfizer it has formed a successful public privatepartnership. The Alliance has reviewed and guidedthe progress of trachoma control activities,integrating the results of ongoing operationalresearch and other field studies. To support thiswork, the WHO and various NGOs developed asuite of manuals and reports (3,127,240,248,584,586,587,588,589,590,591,592,593,594,595,596,597,598). In 1999 the WHO and the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB) jointlylaunched a new global initiative, \"V ision 2020: The Right to Sight\" that aims for the global eliminationof avoidable blindness by 2020 (57). Vision 2020 has three major strategies: disease control, humanresource development and infrastructure andtechnology development. Five areas have beenidentified under disease control, one of which istrachoma, and V ision 2020 has fully adopted the GET 2020 program and the SAFE Strategy. TheSAFE Strategy has also been endorsed by theInternational Council of Ophthalmology and isincluded in their international clinical guidelinesseries (599). The S component: surgery for trichiasis The surgical technique The surgical component of the SAFE Strategy was built around the bilamellar tarsal rotationprocedure described in the 1993 WHO publication (587). Mark Reacher, a young British ophthalmologist working in Oman, was confronted by many casesof trichiasis (see Figure 9.11). His review of theliterature showed more than 47 differenttechniques were currently advocated (600). Somewere modifications of ancient techniques datingback 100 years, but many had been advocated inthe preceding 20 or 30 years. He undertook aninitial study examining the five most commonprocedures with about 30 people in each group(601). Based on the outcomes of this study, he undertook a more definitive study that includedpeople with minor trichiasis (less than five lashestouching the eye), major trichiasis (more than fivelashes touching the globe) and those with defectivelid closure who had had previous unsuccessfulsurgery (116). The bilamellar tarsal rotation was clearly the superior procedure for both minor andmajor trichiasis; at two years 82% of patients withmajor trichiasis had no recurrence (see Figures9.12, 9.13, 9.14). In three-quarters of therecurrences, less than five lashes were touching theglobe. He also showed that two years after surgerythere was a small but significant improvement invisual acuity that averaged half a Snellen line ofvisual acuity, approximately the same as the overalldecreased acuity observed with 10 years of ageingof that cohort. Following bilamellar tarsal rotation,no patients had lid closure defects and only two of150 had a poor cosmetic result. Based on these results, bilamellar tarsal rotation became the recommended procedure in the SAFEStrategy (587). In francophone West Africa aTRACHOMA CONTROL AND THE SAFE STRATEGY 187 of Trichiasis Surgeons (584) and environmental risk factors identified by epidemiologic studies. Theauthors came up with the SAFE Strategy including Surgery for trichiasis, Antibiotic treatment for active trachoma (tetracycline), Face washing to keep children's faces clean, soon changed to Facial cleanliness, and Environmental improvements that focused on water provision, toilets and generalcleanliness leading to fly reduction. The Strategyincorporated the clever acronym, SAFE, although itgave the elements in the reverse order to theirpublic health importance. The acronym EFAS wasfar less catchy. Fortunately SAFE also translatedwell into French as CHANCE. The treatmentrecommendations did not yet include azithromycin(583) (see Table 9.1, Figure 9.10). In 1996, the WHO convened the first Global Scientific Meeting to review trachoma since 1966(257). Using available data (in many cases quite outof date), the group identified 47 countries whereblinding trachoma was known to exist, 13countries in which blinding trachoma wassuspected, and a further 16 countries plus \"somePacific Islands\" where non-blinding trachoma wassuspected. These were distributed in Sub-SaharanAfrica, the Middle East and Crescent, LatinAmerica and Asia. In total, 10% of the world'spopulation (or 590 million people) were at risk,with 146 million active cases of trachoma, and10.6 million people with trichiasis and 5.9 millionpeople who were blind from trachoma. This group strongly supported the adoption of the SAFE Strategy. It also reviewed newly availableresults of recent studies with azithromycin andrecommended its use in trachoma prevention. Thisworking group declared that the GlobalElimination of Trachoma as a Blinding Disease by2020 was an achievable goal, and called on theWHO to take a lead in developing and co-ordinating international efforts and on membercountries to address trachoma. Following this meeting and after a lot of work, a resolution was adopted by the World HealthAssembly in 1998 calling for the Global Elimination of Blinding T rachoma (585) . Subsequently blinding trachoma was defined as: 186 TRACHOMA Figure 9.11 Mark Reacher examining patients during his study on trichiasis surgery in Oman (1989).Table 9.1: Treatment of trachoma, WHO, 1993 (583) Proportion of treatmentAdditional treatment aged 1-10 years with trachoma TF: 20% or more, or Mass topical antibiotic treatment Selective systemic antibiotic treatment TI: 5% or more of severe cases TF: 5% to 20% Mass or individual/ As above family topical antibiotic treatment TF: Less than 5% Individual topical antibiotic treatment Not indicated Mass treatment: (all members of all families in the community) tetracycline one per cent eye ointment applied twice daily for six weeks, or as intermittent treatment, with ointment applied twice daily for five consecutive days per month, or daily for 10 con secutive days per month for at least six consecutive months per year.

Both theseprocedures had been long established in theirongoing national programs. There was discussionas to whether they should be compared with thebilamellar tarsal rotation in clinical trials. Suchcomparative trials have not been published, butgood one year results have been reported with theCuenod Nataf procedure (602). Good results with bilamellar tarsal rotation were reported for Morocco, where 84% were trichiasisfree (603). Of the others, 13.4% had minorrecurrences and 2.4% had lashes touching thecornea. Most recurrences occurred in the first yearafter surgery. Overcorrection was seen in 2.3%,18% reported their vision had improvedsignificantly and 52% reported decreasedlacrimation. The GET 2020 Alliance initially concentrated on the provision of surgical kits and ensuring thatsurgery was provided at a community level (248).Attention was directed to the importance oftraining and certification of surgeons and ongoingmonitoring and evaluation of the surgical program(592,593). Subsequently, recurrence rates rangingfrom 15% to 50% were reported and this causedconsiderable concern (594). Some reported that between 10% to 30% of people who were offeredsurgery refused (586). With a 50% failure rate this refusal might not be considered unreasonable. Factors influencing a recurrence of trichiasis Following reports of quite unacceptably highrecurrence rates, a number of specific studies wereundertaken to identify why this might occur andwhat could be done to prevent this. Women usuallyhave higher rates of scarring trichiasis or ongoingexposure to reinfection, so one obvious factor toexamine was gender. Although one study foundwomen had a 30% increased risk of recurrence(604), another found a 60% increased risk in men(605). People over the age of 40 had a somewhat high risk of recurrence, although this was notsignificant (53,604), and those with more severe trichiasis had an approximately three-foldincreased risk of recurrence (106,605). The presence of inflammation at the time of surgery was the major risk and led to a two- to six-fold increased risk of recurrence (106,605). At times this was associated with bacterialconjunctivitis (106,514). The presence ofchlamydia on PCR testing did not increase the riskof recurrence (106,604,605), although a small study in Nepal found a significant association(606). Similarly , there was no association with the presence of trachoma in the household (604), although if two or more people had activetrachoma there was some increased risk. Due to the potential importance of ongoing bacterial or chlamydial infection, three studies wereundertaken to assess the impact of azithromycinadministered at the time of surgery . One study in The Gambia found no effect (106) with a highrecurrence rate, 41% at one year. It may be that thesurgical technique of the nurses involved was lessthan optimal, masking the possible impact of theantibiotic treatment. In the study in Ethiopia, theone year recurrence rate was reduced from 10.3%in those who received tetracycline ointment to6.9% with azithromycin\u2014a statistically significantreduction (605). The final study in Nepal alsofound a reduction in recurrence with azithromycintreatment of those with major trichiasis, even with an overall rate of recurrence at one year of 29% (607). These results suggest that the presence of inflammation is an important risk factor forrecurrent surgery. Inflammation is more common inthose with severe trichiasis and is often associatedwith chronic bacterial conjunctivitis (515).Chlamydia do not seem to play a significant role inmaintaining this inflammation in surgical patients,as there is no change in surgical outcome with PCRdetection of chlamydia, or family presence oftrachoma (either someone with active trachoma inthe family or family-based treatment) (605). Previous histologic studies also failed todemonstrate the presence of chlamydia in the eyes of those having trichiasis surgery , even if they were inflamed (407). It seems likely that theperioperative use of azithromycin an effecton conjunctival bacterial pathogens rather than aspecific anti-chlamydial effect. Another important risk factor for recurrent trichiasis seems to be the surgeon, their level oftraining and attention to technique. Some studieshave shown no significant surgical variation (605)TRACHOMA CONTROL AND THE SAFE STRATEGY 189 Figure 9.14 Outcomes of randomised controlled trial of trichiasis surgery (Reacher et al 1992 (116).

Surgical factors found to be important in influencing the risk of recurrence include the lengthof the incision, meticulous surgical sterility andattention to suturing (598). Higher recurrence hasbeen observed in the left eye and recurrences aremore common temporally in the left eye andnasally in the right eye, consistent with increaseddifficulty in the accurate placement of sutures byright-handed surgeons (611). A useful review of trichiasis surgery has recently been completed for the Cochrane database (612). This review has the strengths and weaknesses of theCochrane evaluation approach but concludes thatthe bilamellar rotation is probably the besttechnique. Despite the outcome of the randomised trial in Oman (116), a number of programs continued to advocate the use of epilation for people with minortrichiasis. Certainly this is a time-honouredprocedure widely used by the people themselves,for example, 78% of those presenting for trichiasissurgery used epilation in Ethiopa (513). A study inThe Gambia showed that in 12 months one-thirdof patients with less than five lashes had increasedthe severity of their trichiasis, and one-third alsohad progression in corneal scarring (508). Bowmanalso noted that after surgery patients were twice aslikely to show an improvement in vision comparedto those who had not been operated upon.Epilation was usually performed by a friend orfamily member, although one-quarter of the timethe individual epilated themselves. Most of the timelocally-made forceps were used, but fingers werealso used, 20% of patients used hot ash as anadjunct and 20% used traditional eye medicine (see Figures 9.15, 9.16). A large case control in Ethiopia showed that in eyes with mild entropion (trichiasis) epilation didnot reduce the likelihood of corneal opacity (613).However, in eyes with more severe trichiasis,epilation may have reduced the frequency andprogression of corneal opacity. Both studies suggest that people with minor trichiasis should proceed to trichiasis surgery asexpeditiously as possible. However, it would seemto make good sense to epilate lashes while patientswait for surgery and epilate any recurrent lashespost surgery. Care must be taken with epilation notto damage the cornea or break the lashes. Brokenlashes can be even more damaging than intactlashes rubbing the eye because they often form stiffbristles that rapidly abraid the cornea. Surgical uptake Studies have shown that many patients will declinetrichiasis surgery. The numbers can vary greatly but may range between 8% to 35% (240). Havingsurgery performed in the village can increaseuptake (614,615) and several studies have shownthat women were less likely to have surgery thanmen. In central Tanzania only 18% of women withtrichiasis had had surgery in a two-year period(616). Barriers that prevented these women from having surgery included cost, the provision of carefor children left at home and having someoneaccompany them to a health centre. Of those whohad had surgery , two-thirds reported a decrease in pain, a subjective improvement in vision and animproved ability to carry out their activities of dailyliving. A further study in Vietnam showed that eventhough the rate of trichiasis was two to six-foldhigher in women, the rate of surgery wasapproximately equal between men and women(333). This was a further indication of genderdisequity. In a study in Malawi, Courtright found that accessibility to surgery and knowledge of otherpeople who have had successful surgery wereimportant indicators of the likelihood of womenaccepting surgery (617). In Nigeria cost was themain barrier (251). Similar findings come fromIndia where the average duration of symptomsbefore people came for surgery was 30 months (SD \u00b1 46 months) (618). Unoperated trichiasis hasa major impact on quality of life independent of thereduction of visual acuity (619) (see Figure 9.17). It affects physical, psychological and environmentdomains but not the social relationships domain.After surgery these three affected domains eachshowed a significant improvement. An economic analysis in The Gambia found the average cost of untreated trichiasis to the commu-nity was US$89 in 1998 (620). Surgery, including190 TRACHOMA Figure 9.15 Epilation forceps (1979 and 1990) RIGHT available from a local market in Kenya FAR RIGHT worn around the neck in Tanzania. BELOW Figure 9.16 Epilation can frequently lead to broken lashes. These short stubby lashescan be even more damaging thanthe normal inturned lashes.

In addition, by definition, trichiasis surgery isperformed in badly scarred and damaged tissue andcannot restore the normal anatomy or function.Negrel has called trichiasis surgery an attempt at\"squaring the circle\" (53). He sets out the criteriafor the ideal procedure as simple and quick; lowcost; permanent; effective in terms of function,anatomy and aesthetics; safe; and feasible forparamedical staff to perform in the communitysetting (see Figure 9.18). Trichiasis surgery is really a last resort in badly damaged and distorted tissue. Some have suggestedthat new trichiasis operations should be developed.Many of the cleverest surgeons have tried for over2000 years to develop new and better surgicaltechniques. Cataract surgery benefited from thedevelopment of anaesthesia, aseptic andmicrosurgical techniques as has trichiasis surgery.The quantum leap taken by cataract surgery wasthe development of the intra-ocular lens. I see nosuch major breakthrough on the near horizon fortrichiasis surgery. The way forward seems to be touse the tools and techniques we currently have andextend the coverage and quality of surgery. Withtrachoma control activities trichiasis should ceaseto be a public health problem long before a newbreakthrough in trichiasis surgery appears.The A component: antibiotic treatment In trachoma, antibiotics are used to reduce the level of chlamydial infection and break the cycle of repeated episodes of repeated reinfection. Ofcourse, they will also reduce any concomitantbacterial infection. For whatever reason, a singlecourse of antibiotics may not totally eliminatechlamydia. This is true in trachoma and also ingenital tract infection (623,624). It is unclearwhether this is due to poor compliance, reinfection,levels of antibiotic lasting less than the slowestreplication time, the presence of organisms in a true \"persistent\" and insensitive state, or the use of antibiotics that are really only bacteriostatic forchlamydia rather than being bacteriocidal.Whatever the reason, 70 years of experience showsthat antibiotic treatment needs to be repeated anumber of times. If the only change in an endemicarea is treatment with antibiotics then onceantibiotic distribution has stopped there is nothingto stop the recrudescence of trachoma to itsprevious levels. There are many examples fromSub-Saharan Africa through the Middle East toCentral Australia. For these reasons, the WHO supported antibiotic treatment with the other threecomponents of the SAFE Strategy to achieveTRACHOMA CONTROL AND THE SAFE STRATEGY 193 transport, cost US$6.13 per case and patients'expressed willingness to pay was assessed to beUS$1.43. This showed a lack of individual perceivedvalue in trichiasis surgery at a community level. The way forward In 2003, the WHO (3) estimated there were 7.6million people with trichiasis who required surgery.Even the largest current national programs are onlymaking a small impact on the number of trichiasisoperations needed. Clearly there is a growing needfor trichiasis surgery. Accordingly programs need toboost their capacity and expand their services. Thenumber of people who require trichiasis surgerywill continue to increase as the numbers of olderpeople in endemic areas increase (304). A three-foldincrease in 30 years has been projected (309).Surgery will be needed long after active trachomadisappears as the last cohorts who had severe activetrachoma as children progressively age. It makes good sense to treat patients who have active conjunctival inflammation at the time ofsurgery. As much of this inflammation seems to bedue to bacterial infection, the use of azithromycinor another convenient antibiotic at the time ofsurgery is good practice. Surgeons who are trainedneed to actually undertake the surgery they havebeen trained to do. The surgical output wasexamined in 95 surgeons trained in the preceding10 years and a further 28 trainees could not belocated, had died or retired (621). The mediantrichiasis operations were only seven per year,ranging from 0 for 22 to over 100 for fivesurgeons. Those surgeons who were linked withoutreach activities undertook more surgery. Goodsupervision and complete surgical kits wereimportant factors for increased output. There is a tremendous range in surgical outcome with recurrence rates varying from 5% or 6% to40% in one year. There is an urgent need to ensurethat every surgeon is properly trained in bothsurgical procedure and the use of sterile techniques.The WHO has developed a new publication Final Assessment of T richiasis Surgeons (584) that should improve standardisation and quality ofsurgery . Clearly the challenge for the foreseeable future is for programs to ensure that qualitytrichiasis surgery is consistently carried out andstrive for recurrence rates below 10%.Finally, each surgeon should actively monitor patients they have already operated on for thefollowing two reasons. A surgeon should monitoror audit their own surgery to provide importantfeedback to themselves as a means of qualitycontrol. This is basic surgical best practice. Of evenmore importance, it must be remembered thatscarring and trichiasis can be a progressive diseaseand trichiasis is likely to recur. Data from Oman would suggest that with a 17 year follow-up, some 47% of patients with mildtrichiasis may eventually have recurrence, evenwhen short-term (two year) results are excellent(622). Over half of the unoperated eyes thatinitially did not have trichiasis also developedtrichiasis. This underscores the progressive natureof this disease. Unfortunately many of those involved in trachoma field programs have been influenced bytheir experience with the delivery of cataractsurgery. On the one hand, modern intra-ocularcataract surgery is a miracle; significant sight canbe restored within hours of surgery and the patient,their family and the whole village celebrate thisrestoration of vision. However this is not the casewith trichiasis surgery. Post-operatively the eyelidslook funny. Although there may be a statisticalimprovement in vision and a reduction in the riskof further loss of vision, these indirect futurebenefits are often not perceived by the patient, theirfamily or community. In contradistinction, therestoration of vision after cataract surgery can be192 TRACHOMA Figure 9.18 Advanced trichiasis and corneal scarring (TT and CO). Lid surgery may make this Tanzanian woman more comfortable but it will not significantly change her vision. Figure 9.19 Molecular structure ofazithromycin.TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:55 PM Page 192There is little interaction with other drugs and there is no need to change its dosage with theconcomitant use of other drugs. Importantly, thereis no evidence of mutagenicity. It is not teratogenicat maternal toxic doses and teratogenicity has notbeen reported in over 15 years of human clinicaluse. A recent study shows no adverse effects ofazithromycin treatment during pregnancy onmalformations, spontaneous abortion, foetaldistress, gestational age or birth weight (633).Although azithromycin has not been testedspecifically for safety in children under six months,it has been found to be safe and effective inchildren over six months. It is listed as a Class B1drug, which means it can be used in pregnancywhen the benefits outweigh the risks associatedwith being untreated (629). Adverse reactions are rarely reported with azithromycin and include diarrhoea or nausea in5% or less, and less frequent reports of vomiting orabdominal pain. Azithromycin has fewer side effects than many oral antibiotics previously usedto treat trachoma such as the sulphonamides andtetracyclines (625). This has also been the experience in the field and most studies report fewif any side effects (634). Due to its broad spectrum, especially for Gram- positive organisms, azithromycin also offers theadditional advantage of concurrently treating manyrespiratory , skin and genital infections (635,636). This is often perceived in the community as themajor benefit of mass treatment. The use ofsystemic medication also leads to the treatment ofchlamydial infection in other mucosal surfaces, andthis may prevent chlamydial reinfection fromautoinoculation (637). Despite the advantages of asingle oral dose, azithromycin eye drops have alsobeen developed and are effective in treatingbacterial conjunctivitis (638). When used twice aday for three days they are as effective againsttrachoma as a single oral dose (639). Field trials with azithromycin The first three trials of azithromycin treatment intrachoma compared the drug against topicaltetracycline ointment (203,640,641,642). AlthoughGambian and Saudi studies examined the effect ofa single dose, the study in Egypt also examinedthree repeat doses at weekly intervals and six dosesat monthly intervals. These studies showed thatazithromycin treatment was as effective as topicaltetracycline (see Figure 9.20). No advantage wasseen with multiple doses of azithromycin. Both ofthese studies treated individual selected children.No treatment was given to other family membersand so there was no control for the possibility ofreinfection. Both studies assessed clinical diseaseand the presence of infection in conjunctivalsmears, and both showed a more dramatic decreasein the presence of chlamydia and a slower decreasein the reduction of clinical trachoma. A subsequent multi-centred trial was conductedsustainable trachoma control. When the SAFEStrategy was first promulgated tropical tetracyclinewas the only realistic option available. However, bythe time the Global Alliance first met in 1997,azithromycin had already undergone successfulclinical trials against trachoma and its use wasrecommended (248). In 2004, azithromycin was added to the WHO model list of essential drugsand to the WHO model formulary (597). Azithromycin and its mechanism of action Azithromycin was the first member of a newazalide subclass of macrolide antimicrobialsderived from erythromycin with a methyl-substituted nitrogen in the lactone ring (625).Azithromycin possesses a broad spectrum ofactivity against Gram-positive and Gram-negativebacteria and is more effective than othererythromycins against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (see Figure 9.19). Azithromycin is effective against chlamydia and binds to the 50S RNA ribosome and so blockstranslation of RNA and protein synthesis(625,626). In vitro, it prevents the growth of chlamydia at all stages of development (627).Unlike conventional antibiotics that are onlyeffective if introduced to the culture system in thefirst six hours, azithromycin can block chlamydialreplication in cultures up to seven days afterinfection. Unlike penicillin which blocks thedevelopment of chlamydia and leads to persistentinfection, azithromycin causes the development ofghost-like particles (627). Azithromycin has high acid stability and approximately 30% is absorbed. It can easily betaken with food. The assumed half life is greaterthan 60 hours and it is primarily excreted unalteredthrough the biliary and faecal routes (625). Themean inhibitory (MIC) forchlamydia is given at 0.125 g per litre. Early studies in genital tract infection showed that a single dose of azithromycin (1g or 20mg perkg) was effective as a full seven-day course ofdoxycycline (628). Azithromycin has high tissueselectivity and becomes concentrated inmacrophages, polymorphs and epithelial cells(625,629). Intracellular levels are 100 times higherthan serum levels. This is especially important giventhe intracellular growth of chlamydia. Pharmaco-kinetic studies have shown that serum levels areabove the MIC for 24 hours in serum. However, intears levels they are more than 10 times the MICand remain above the MIC for at least six days(630). In conjunctival biopsies of uninflamed eyesazithromycin levels far exceed the MIC for at least15 days (631). Azithromycin is the treatment recommended by Centers for Disease Control in the USA forchlamydial genital tract infection including inpregnant women (624). Although erythromycin isthe recommended treatment for chlamydialinfection in infants, the Morbidity & MortalityWeekly Report (MMWR) notes: Data on the use of other macrolides (eg. azithromycin and clarithromycin) for the treatment of neonatalchlamydial infection are limited. The results of onestudy involving a limited number of patients suggestthat a short course of azithromycin, 20 mg/kg/dayorally, 1 dose daily for 3 days, may be effective (624). They also point to treatment failure rates of 4% for genital infections and up to 20% in neonates. CDCalso recommends azithromycin for the treatment ofinfants with pertussis in preference to erythromycin(632). Azithromycin meets the criteria for the ideal drug for trachoma: \"A drug that is chlamydicidal,non-toxic and readily administered as a single dosewould be ideal for mass treatment\" (580). Inaddition, it also has high intracellular penetration(53). Because azithromycin provides a safe singleoral dose treatment, individual diagnosis is notrequired and its distribution can be integrated intoprimary health care. However, one must rememberthat repeated treatment will be required and for asustainable impact, antibiotic distribution needs tobe accompanied by other components of the SAFEStrategy. Azithromycin is registered for use in the treatment of infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae , H. influenzae, Moraxella and chlamydia moderate severity),pharyngitis, tonsillitis, otitis media, skin infection,urethritis, cervicitis and genital ulcers (629). It is contraindicated in those with severe pneumoniaand in people with demonstrated hypersensitivity.194 TRACHOMA Figure 9.20 The decrease in clinical signs of trachoma seen in The Gambia following a single oral doseof azithromycin compared to a six-week course of \"conventionaltherapy\" (topical tetracycline anderythromycin for severe cases) (Baileyet al 1993 (203).

Further, this analysis suggested thatoral treatment was neither more nor less effectivethan topical treatment. The Cochrane Collaboration brings great strength by the rigorous assessment of prospectiverandomised controlled trials and uses openlydisclosed criteria. This provides a firm evidencebase of efficacy. However, the rigorous criteria andprocedures of a Cochrane Review have strengthsand weaknesses (644,645,646). Since the Review, four large cohort studies have been reported, eachshowing a decrease in the prevalence of activetrachoma and infection following community-widetreatment. Several other cohort studies wereexcluded from consideration in the CochraneReview . The Review neither assesses the method of identifying and treating individuals, nor thepossibility of study subjects being exposed tocontinuing episodes of reinfection. Students whoare starting the school year in a boarding school,for example, are removed from the family pool ofinfection. The interpretation of placebo-controlledstudies using these students is therefore difficult.Similarly, treating individual school-age childrenwho continue to live at home is difficult becausethese children are likely to have falling rates oftrachoma, although they still may be exposed toreinfection at home. Studies of \"mass treatment\"that do not treat children less than one year or sixmonths leave untreated significant sources forreinfection within the family. The design of antibiotic trials needs to reflect that trachoma is \"a disease of the cr\u00e8che\". Thismeans it is the family unit that should be treated,not the individual. Another corollary of this is thatcommunity-based studies may not be necessary toevaluate the impact of antibiotic treatment, as theunit of transmission is the family, not thecommunity. The study of families instead of villagesor communities would greatly simplify the designof future studies. Currently studies usuallyrandomise a relatively small number of villages.They end up with a very large study but still withonly limited statistical power. If families were used,one could randomise a much larger number offamilies which would both decrease the size andcomplexity of the study and greatly increase itsstatistical power. A cohort study in the mesoendemic Rombo district of northern Tanzania showed a strikingreduction in infection (226). At baseline theprevalence of active trachoma was 20% and rates of active disease at each of the follow-upexaminations were approximately half the baselineprevalence. Each age group of children showed amarked initial drop and then some variation.Trachoma was graded using the simplified grading TRACHOMA CONTROL AND THE SAFE STRATEGY 197 in Egypt, Tanzania and The Gambia, theAzithromycin Control of Trachoma (ACT) study(221). This trial randomised villages to receiveeither community-wide distribution of oralazithromycin with three doses given one weekapart, or topical tetracycline daily for six weeks. Inthe azithromycin villages women of childbearingage were treated with either erythromycin oramoxicillin for two weeks. Compliance wasreported to be over 90% except for tetracyclinetreatment in Egypt. Clinically active trachoma wasreduced more effectively by azithromycin thantopical tetracycline at three and 12 months.Infection as determined by LCR was also reducedmore effectively by azithromycin in each of thethree countries at three months. A detailed analysisof clinical trachoma was not presented, althoughthe overall amount of trachoma in each area wasreduced by about half at one year, and theprevalence of severe inflammation was reduced to one-third or one-sixth of pre-treatment levels.This study analysis was based on LCR positivity,but interpretation of these results is hamperedbecause in two study sites 30% of children withoutdisease were LCR positive. In the third site the ratewas 1.8%. This strongly suggests the possibility of false positivities or specimen contamination attwo sites and this would significantly reduce the ability to determine the effect of a treatment (see Figure 9.21). A 10 year follow-up of Egyptian villages in the ACT study showed a marked reduction intrachoma in all three villages irrespective oftreatment allocation (643). This was attributed to socioeconomic development. The householdclustering of disease was noted to be even moreobvious as rates declined, emphasising the need forfamily-based treatment. A Cochrane Review has been undertaken looking at the impact of antibiotic treatment ontrachoma (642). It included some 15 studies dating back to 1966, half of which had been completedbefore 1973. This study concluded that \"there issome evidence that antibiotics reduce activetrachoma but results are not consistent and cannotbe pooled\" (642). Selected studies were \"consistentwith there being no effect of antibiotics but aresuggestive of a lowering of the point prevalence ofrelative risk of both active disease and laboratory Figure 9.21 The results of the ACT Study.

Most of the dataanalysis was based on PCR including quantitativePCR. There was dramatic and progressivereduction in infectious load after treatment so attwo years only one child was still positive by PCR,whereas 91 people had been PCR positive prior totreatment (see Figure 9.22). In this study all those over the age of 12 months were offered azithromycin. Children under the ageof 12 months and pregnant women were giventetracycline ointment for six weeks. Treatmentcoverage was quite extraordinary at 97.6%.Importantly, in addition at each re-examinationround, any person found to have active clinicaldisease at any exam was given a further course oftetracycline ointment. This study did not actuallyexamine the impact of a single dose ofazithromycin, but rather azithromycinsupplemented by six monthly retreatment of anyactive trachoma with topical tetracycline. Thisstudy has been misinterpreted by some to showthat a single oral dose of azithromycin caneliminate infection. Even though there wasextraordinarily good compliance with the initialround of treatment, infection was not eliminatedand a significant number of children were retreatedevery six months. The results could be used tosupport the efficacy of retreatment every sixmonths with either tetracycline or azithromycin.Significantly, this study did not implement any ofthe other components of the SAFE Strategy. A report at five years showed no residual infection in one to nine-year-old children in Romboand rates of TF had finally fallen (647). Thecommunity had been retreated with azithromycinat 24 months, although no further tetracycline hadbeen distributed. It was suggested that transmissionof chlamydia had dropped below the criticalthreshold required to sustain episodes ofreinfection, the so-called \"Allee effect\". Another cohort study in a hyperendemic area in central Tanzania is interpreted quite differently toshow that a single dose of azithromycin does noteliminate infection (122). Unlike Rombo, follow-up treatment was not given. This study aimed to treateverybody over the age of six months withazithromycin. Children under six months were nottreated and pregnant women who did not haveclinical disease were given topical tetracycline orotherwise they received azithromycin. Overall, thecoverage rate was 86%. Baseline prevalence oftrachoma in children under the age of 10 years canbe calculated as 72%, although data are notpresented on the impact of treatment on clinicaldisease in the initial report. However , at baseline, 57% of participants had chlamydia demonstratedby PCR and this was reduced to 12% at twomonths. Most of the residual load was inindividuals under the age of 10 (122). Further study of this village showed that the prevalence ofclinical trachoma in children aged one to sevenyears had dropped from 77% at baseline to 47% at12 months, but returned to 57% at 18 months. Thepercentage of those who were laboratory positivein this age group went from 68% at baseline andstayed around 21% at 2, 6, 12 and 18 months(299). Another report on this study uses slightlydifferent age ranges (298). Other cohort studies are reported from Ethiopia. One study of 24 villages treated all residents oneyear and older with azithromycin, pregnant womenwere offered tetracycline ointment, but childrenunder the age of one apparently were not treated(526). The coverage was 92% of those who wereeligible. Follow-up data on clinical given. was 56% at baseline,it dropped to 7% at two months and had risen to11% at six months. Another study published afterthe Cochrane Review examined eight villages thathad been treated and a further 15 untreated villagesthat served as a non-concurrent control (648).Again clinical data were not given and there was achange in the technique used to collect samples forPCR testing between the baseline examination andthe 12 month examination of treated villages,which coincided with the baseline examination ofcontrol villages. The treated villages showed adecrease from a mean level of infection of 44%before treatment to 5% at two months, with amodest recrudescence to 7% at 12 months, and11% at 24 months. In one of the eight villagesinfection seemed to have disappeared. The controlvillages showed what was attributed to a strong\"secular trend\" as their baseline infection rate wasonly 17%. The change in collection techniquesbetween the two \"baseline\" collections may have198 TRACHOMA accounted for some of this difference. These studiesconcluded that a single dose of azithromycin wasnot enough to eliminate trachoma. In the absenceof the other components of the SAFE Strategy orthe more frequent use of antibiotic, trachomawould return over a 24 month period. They alsoshowed that infection with trachoma can increasefrom very low levels. Mathematical modellingsuggested that in this area treatment should berepeated every six months (526). An earlier study of Ethiopian children under 12 months of age who had not been treated andchildren born after azithromycin distributionshowed a significant reduced risk of infection sixmonths after the treatment round (648). InTanzania no evidence could be found for aprotected cohort effect, although after two roundsof treatment given 18 months apart, levels ofinfection and clinical trachoma were lower in pre-schoolchildren than in the initial cohort (649). A cohort study was also undertaken in a hypoendemic area in The Gambia where 14 villageswere studied (238). The baseline prevalence of active disease was 8% and 7% showed infectionwith PCR. Everybody over the age of six monthswas treated, children under six months were giventetracycline ointment and women of child-bearingage were given oral erythromycin for two weeks.Thus antibiotic coverage was 83%. The resultswere variable with a poor response in two villagesattributed to a large number of village residentstravelling on a pilgrimage. However , in 12 of the 14 villages the initial mean prevalence ofinfection fell from 3% to 0.3%. The other twovillages had a baseline infection rate of 24% and at17 months had dropped to 11%. These datasuggest that in hypoendemic areas a single dose ofazithromycin can have a long lasting effect in theabsence of other intervention, although persistinginfection was seen especially in younger childrenwho had high loads of infection. In houses withlow levels of infection or relatively good hygiene asingle dose of azithromycin may eliminateinfection, but repeated treatment will be neededwhere there is a high pressure of reinfectionamongst young children. Another cohort study in Nepal compared the treatment of all children aged one to 10 years withthe targeted treatment of the whole family of thosechildren with active trachoma (650). For familytreatment, children over the age of six months weretreated with azithromycin and pregnant womenwere offered either erythromycin or tetracycline.The prevalence of trachoma at baseline was 29%and coverage was 95%. No difference was seenbetween the two treatment strategies and the ratesof trachoma approximately halved in each group.LCR testing was also performed but these data werenot presented. Other studies have reported the useof azithromycin in selected subgroups, usuallyschoolchildren and sometimes their families (310,651). However, the outcomes of these studies aredifficult to interpret because of study design issues. Antibiotic resistance To date, C. trachomatis has not developed acquired resistance to any antibiotic that has been used on alarge scale to treat chlamydial infection. Thesedrugs include sulphas that have been in use for 70years, tetracycline and erythromycin for about 50years and azithromycin for 15 years. There is asingle report in the literature of three isolates ofmultiple drug resistant C. trachomatis for genital swabs (652). Although chlamydia have a plasmid,because of its unique replication cycle, thehorizontal exchange of antimicrobial resistancefactors is not seen as an issue (653). Some strains of C. suis are naturally resistant to tetracycline. Gene insertion techniques indicated that this resistance isconferred by novel resistance genes contained inapparent plasmids that are integrated into thechlamydial chromosome (654). Concern has been expressed rightly about the possibility of other bacteria becoming resistant toazithromycin. Erythromycin-resistant Gram-positiveorganisms show cross resistance to azithromycin(625) but despite the extensive use of erythromycin over many years, only limited and sporadicoutbreaks of bacterial resistance to erythromycinamongst previously sensitive organisms are evident.The prolonged tissue levels of azithromycin reducethe likelihood of the induction of bacterialresistance following incomplete treatment courses,although it will always favour the selection of pre-existing resistant strains (655). The development ofresistance of ocular bacteria to tetracycline was notseen to be an issue after its topical use, although thedisappearance of Moraxella was noted (656). TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:55 PM Page 198In The Gambia a significant reduction in S. pneumoniae carriage in the oropharynx was noted after oral treatment with azithromycin (657). There was no change in H. influenzae frequency and a lesser effect was seen with tetracycline. An important study was reported from a community in Central Australia where there was asignificant reduction in the nasopharyngeal carriageof S. pneumoniae two months after azithromycin treatment, although at six months carriage hadrebounded (658). Before treatment only one of 54isolates of S. pneumoniae was azithromycin- resistant. Two weeks after treatment, six of 11isolates were resistant, at two months 10 of 29 andat six months two of 34 (see Table 9.2).T h e selective effect of azithromycin appeared to allowthe growth and transmission of pre-existingazithromycin resistant strains and furthersurveillance of this effect was stronglyrecommended. However , there was a significant reduction in invasive S. pneumoniae serotypes present at baseline and recolonisation occurredwith different serotypes. A subsequent report from the same community found colonisation ratesof Group A streptococci had dropped markedlytwo weeks after treatment but had returned to pre-treatment levels by two months (636).Azithromycin resistance was not seen. At two andsix months, the rate of skin sores was halved withtreatment (see Figure 9.23). Similar reductions inskin infections and in diarrhoea have also beenreported from Nepal (635). No resistance to S. pneumoniae was found before azithromycin treatment in Nepal, but threeof seven strains isolated two weeks after treatmentwere resistant (659). Two of these strains camefrom children who had had azithromycin-sensitiveS. pneumoniae at baseline. A subsequent study examined nasopharyngeal isolates one year afterazithromycin treatment and showed no residualresistance (660). A recent report from the Kimberley region in Western Australia shows the continuing sensitivityof S. pneumoniae to penicillin, the recommended first line therapy (661). In this area azithromycin isroutinely used as the initial treatment for peoplewith suspected sexually transmitted infection andtheir partners. Azithromycin resistance of S. pneumoniae does not seem to be a real issue as azithromycin is not recommended or used to treatS. pneumoniae infections (662). Although there is a global system of monitoring bacterial resistance to azithromycin (593), datafrom trachoma areas are more restricted. Data arealso collected in Australia, but they are notspecifically analysed for areas in whichazithromycin distribution has taken place (663). In these studies, as elsewhere, resistance toerythromycin is taken to represent resistance toazithromycin (664). Overall, resistance rates of S. pneumoniae have increased from 8% in 1994 to 23% in 2005 (see Figure 9.24). 200 TRACHOMA Table 9.2: Nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae: frequency and proportion of azithromycin (AZM)-resistant strains before an d after treatment with AZM for trachoma (658)Azithromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae No. of children Total no.

Figure 9.24 Erythromyin from these trachoma endemic communi- ties of the type of rebound phenomenon inferred byBrunham with one recent exception (666). In late 2006, a report from Vietnam presented the three-year findings of trachoma control in threeintervention villages; one village had S, another S, A and F and the third had S, A, F and E (669).The authors reported a four-fold increased rate ofinfection detected by PCR in the two villages whereazithromycin had been distributed for two yearscompared to the third village where topicaltetracycline had been used. They conclude that \"theincreasing reinfection rates suggest that treatmentmay interrupt the duration of infection required fordeveloping immunity, increasing the number ofindividuals susceptible to reinfection and disease prevalence over time\"(669). Inother words azithromycin treatment (combinedwith S and F in both villages and E in one) madetrachoma worse. This unusual finding stimulatedconsiderable press and email traffic. Editorials(670) and letters to the editor (671,672) pointedout some of the methodologic weaknesses of thisstudy and analysis. They included questions aboutthe diagnostic accuracy of both PCR testing andclinical grading, the highest prevalence of infection(21%) was in the older age group where there waslittle active disease (4%) and the prevalence ofinfection was similar in those with and withoutdisease. The question of contamination of PCRspecimens comes up again. The poor overallcoverage of antibiotic treatment resulting from thetargeting of schoolchildren resulted in the treatmentof only 11% with infection (PCR positive) and lessthan half with active disease. The study villages allhave low prevalences of trachoma (<5%), therewas only one village in each group and baselineinter-village variances were not analysed.Furthermore, no measures of the immune responsewere made which makes their inference speculative.It will be most interesting if such exceptionalfindings can be repeated by other, well-designedand carefully conducted studies. The next steps Despite 15 years of trials with azithromycin andtens of millions of doses distributed, there are somemajor questions about the distribution ofazithromycin that need to be addressed, even if onetakes a somewhat less acerbic view than theCochrane Review (642). There are at least sixmajor issues to be resolved: 1 Who to treat? (what about infants and pregnant women?). 2 How to treat? (family- or community-based). 3 Why treat? (a prevalence >10%, >5% or <5%). 4 When to treat? (six or 12 monthly).5 What to treat? (infection, clinical disease, blinding trachoma). 6 When to stop? (what test to use and what prevalence?). Clearly these answers need to be ascertained in areas where F and E components also have beenimplemented. 1. Who to treat? Several studies with quantitative PCR (168,122,227) have confirmed earlier observations (92) thatthe highest levels of infectious organisms are foundin the youngest children, particularly those withintense active disease. In fact, much of this infectionis in children under the age of one year. As alreadynoted, many studies have not treated childrenunder the age of one, and almost none have treatedchildren less than six months, even though CDCrecommends the use of azithromycin for thetreatment of chlamydial infection and pertussis ininfants in the first six months of life (624,632).This would seem to be a major gap in our currentprotocols for the distribution of azithromycin. Toleave untreated the family-based infantile fountainsof infection seems to me to be totally counter-intuitive. Equally, a strong case can be made for treating all women with azithromycin rather than relyingon their possible use of tetracycline or thecomplexity of a two-week course of erythromycinor amoxcillin. The WHO noted that azithromycinis a Class B1 drug for which there is no evidence ofadverse effects on the foetus, although there isinsufficient data to specifically recommend its usein pregnancy except in the absence of adequateTRACHOMA CONTROL AND THE SAFE STRATEGY 203 Tom Lietman and colleagues examined overall antibiotic usage in a village in Nepal (665). One-third of children under three years of age and halfthe children under 10 had taken antibiotics in thepreceding year. Two-thirds of these antibiotics wereeffective against chlamydia. Children received onaverage 3.0 defined daily doses of antibioticeffective against chlamydia each year. The annualmass distribution of azithromycin would increasethis by 2.6. Recrudescence of infection The WHO recommendation for the use ofantibiotic as part of the SAFE Strategy is to\"initially conduct mass treatment with antibioticpreferably azithromycin for a minimum of threeyears and not stopping until TF in one to nine-year-old children is less than 5%\" (3). If the prevalenceof TF is more than 5%, mass treatment shouldcontinue with subsequent surveys repeated everyone to three years as indicated. If the prevalence isless than 5%, individual or family-based treatmentshould be considered. The intent of theserecommendations is to give guidance to developmore effective and efficient programs. It is explicit that A (antibiotic treatment) is anintegral part of the full SAFE strategy. Despite these recommendations and almost without exception, the studies quoted so far haveassessed antibiotic treatment in isolation and havenot included the other components of the SAFEStrategy. Facial cleanliness and environmentalcomponents are designed to reduce the likelihoodof ongoing reinfection and give a sustainablereduction in trachoma. Without these componentsto reduce the possibility of transmission, trachomawould be expected to soon reappear after antibiotictreatment. In a hyperendemic area in Ethiopia the astounding, exponential rate of return of infectionof 12.3% per month has been observed (526). Inthis study children under the age of one were nottreated and pregnant women were only treatedwith topical tetracycline. In another hyperendemicarea in central Tanzania, infection levels wereinitially reduced to quite low levels, but started toincrease gradually from two months andaccelerated after 12 months (298). Incident infection at six months was 3.5 times more likely ifanother member of the household was alsoinfected. The risk was not increased by travel,visitors, gender , or whether the individual had been treated. Re-emergent or recrudescent infectionoccurred within the family. Further analysis usingspatial distribution confirmed the householdclustering of infection, and only after 12 monthsspread from one household to another was noticed (299). The persistence of chlamydial ocular infection after antibiotic treatment in the absence of obviousreinfection has been reported. For example, 32% of neonates who had been treated with both topicaltetracycline and oral erythromycin for two weekshad chlamydia carriage inchildren with trachoma did not seem to causeinfection after treatment in one study in Tanzania(326), although a more recent study in three siteshas suggested infected nasal secretions may play amore important role (328). An unexpected potential complication of antibiotic treatment comes from observing thenumber of notifications of chlamydial sexuallytransmitted diseases in British Columbia (666).Brunham has noted an apparent increase ininfection and reinfection after an infection controlprogram based on early case identification andtreatment had been introduced. He has postulatedthat early treatment may prevent the developmentof full protective immunity which would leave theperson more susceptible to subsequent reinfection.Some support for this notion comes from animalexperiments that show that mice treated within thefirst three days of inoculation will clear theinfection without time to develop the normalpartial immunity to rechallenge (667). Therefore onrechallenge they behaved essentially as na\u00efve mice.However, it is unclear whether any human diseasemanagement program could identify and treatpatients with genital tract infection within threedays of inoculation. Others have reported asignificant change in the frequency of positivereports following a change in chlamydial testingand have cautioned about the over-interpretation ofthese trends (668). When the transmission of trachoma has been reduced, a fall in the intensity of the infection isnoticed first, followed by a decrease in the incidenceof new infection, and finally a reduction in theprevalence of inactive disease. There has been no202 TRACHOMATRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:48 PM Page 2022. How to treat? The importance of family-based transmission of trachoma has been made repeatedly. This also leadsto the corollary of the importance of family-basedtreatment. The recommendation to treat the wholecommunity when prevalence levels are high (>5%or 10%) is really made on logistic grounds; it ischeaper and easier to go ahead and organise a masstreatment of the whole community rather than tryto examine and treat every family individually.However, this does not mean that future treatmentstudies cannot take the family as the treatment unit.It has been clearly shown to be the transmissionunit and the source of re-emergence of infection(298,526). The use of weight-adjusted dose of suspension for young children (20mg/kg) initially requiredeach child to be weighed. Borrowing from an ideaused successfully with the distribution of ivermectinto treat onchocerciasis (673), a height-adjustedschedule was also introduced for azithromycin(674) (see Tables 9.3, 9.4, Figure 9.25). Again borrowing from the experience of ivermectin distribution was the use of communitydirected treatment (675). Earlier experience in trachoma control activities in South Africa (676)and T anzania have used community volunteers to distribute antibiotics successfully (677,678).Successful community-based treatment ofivermectin requires community ownership andsupport of community leaders (679). Coverage was related to the ratio of distributors to people to betreated; two per 250 seemed optimal. Betterperformance (coverage) was seen when directincentives (cash or in-kind compensation) were notgiven. V olunteer distributors seemed to be motivated by political goodwill, personalsatisfaction and altruistic fulfilment. The WHO has set a target coverage of 80% for azithromycin distribution (3). Some studies havereported much higher coverage (221,226) andothers have reported lower rates (310,650) . Clearly coverage is important and likely to be lower inprogrammatic activities (680). A meta analysis ofTRACHOMA CONTROL AND THE SAFE STRATEGY 205 alternatives (596,633). However, CDC doesrecommend azithromycin for the treatment ofgenital chlamydial infection in pregnancy (624).Pregnant women, especially those with other youngchildren with active trachoma, must also be apotent source of potential reinfection within thefamily. They are also likely to have extraocularinfection that may place their unborn baby atconsiderable risk. A single oral dose ofazithromycin makes good sense.204 TRACHOMA Table /ml mg/treatment Adults 4 1000 Children >35 kg 4 1000 Children 25-35kg 3 750 Children 17-25kg 2 500 Children 15-20kg 10ml 400 Children 10-15kg 7.5ml 300 Children 7-10kg 5ml 200 One bottle POS = four children (under five years of age) One case POS/48 bottles = 192 childrenOne bottle tablets = seven adults or 11 children aged five years or overOne case tablets/48 bottles = 360 adults or 528 children Table 9.4: Standardised height-based treatment schedule for children aged six months to 15 years receiving azithromycin for the treatment of trachoma (674) Height (cm)Dose Children aged six to 59 years receiving tablets 74.0-87.8 250mg (one tablet) 87.9-120.3 500mg (two tablets) 120.4-137.6 750mg tablets) 137.7 1000mg (four tablets) Figure 9.25 Distributing azithromycin (courtesy, Sheila West) LEFT a child being weighed during azithromycin distribution in Tanzania RIGHT the suspension being delivered. TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:48 PM Page 204azithromycin distribution was significantly reduced (odds ratio 0.3) if the child had actually beentreated (649). This effect had disappeared at one year (odds ratio 1.18). This also suggests thatrepeat treatment every six months may be moreappropriate than annual treatment. An interestingmodelling analysis using Ethiopian data suggeststhat to be maximally effective annual antibiotictreatment should be given three months before the\"low\" season (684). Based on modelling their trachoma data, Lietman has clearly stated \"singlemass treatment will not eliminate trachoma\" (682)(see Figure 9.26). 5. What to treat? and 6. When to stop? The ultimate objective of trachoma control isclearly the elimination of blinding trachoma. Alsothe prevalence of active trachoma, particularly TFin children, is a relatively slow indicator to change,particularly if there is any ongoing reinfection. Alltreatment studies that have measured TI rates havefound they will fall much more rapidly than TF.The difficulty with the grading of TI is the problemof over diagnosis (see chapter three). However, itmay be that TI should be the clinical indicator usedto assess the shorter term efficacy of interventionsbecause it is more sensitive to change than TF andwill change more quickly. Also TI is a betterindicator of disease severity and the likelihood ofscarring and blindness. Proper standardisation ofgraders and probably the use of photodocumentation will be required to increase theprecision of this critical sign. The alternative promoted by many is to use laboratory tests as the indication of the presence ofchlamydial infection and thereby trachoma(202,258). Although laboratory tests have beenwidely used in clinical trials, added expense (685)and technical complexity have been barriers totheir widespread use in programmatic activities(206). If they were to be used one might select anindicator group, such as children under the age ofone, as a way of monitoring the load of infection ina community. An alternative to NAAT testingmight be the newly developed \"dip stick\" EIA test(205). This may prove a cheap and easy field-friendly laboratory test and the results of thefurther evaluation of this new test are anticipatedwith interest. However, the programmatic costs ofeven the cheapest tests can become significant whenrepeated thousands or millions of times. To help guide the distribution of azithromycin the WHO prepared a manual Trachoma Control, AGuide for Program Managers (127) that goes to some lengths to present the method of assessing therequirements for azithromycin and the process ofits distribution. This complements an earlierpublication by the International TrachomaInitiative (588). The F component: facial cleanliness Although facial cleanliness is seen as the critical,final common pathway by which a variety ofenvironmental factors affect the risk of trachoma,facial cleanliness is the component of the SAFEStrategy that has received the least attention. Inpart this may be because it does require abehavioural change and these are not necessarilyeasy to induce. It is much easier to drive in, bore awell, or tell people to take a pill, or even build a pitlatrine and drive out again. Behavioural change canbe hard to achieve and may need prolonged localinvolvement, but in the end, this is what is needed.As Fred Hollows would have said \"It is a heartsand minds job\". An interesting and fundamentally significant change in personal hygiene in western culture hasbeen the adoption of toilet paper (686). Before the1800s the use of paper was virtually unknown.Specially manufactured toilet paper first appearedin 1857 and by 1900 it was in general use. Thisdramatic change occurred in the absence of anyovert or co-ordinated public health educationcampaign. What was required was health\"hardware\". The increased provision of indoorplumbing, for example, was associated with theincreased use of toilet paper. In this case, the\"software\" came naturally. Many programs that have included facial cleanliness, or the F component, have also includedthe other components of the SAFE Strategy, andthey will be reviewed in the last section of thischapter. In this section, I want to review theevidence that specifically supports the notion of theimportance of increasing facial cleanliness. Several early studies in Australian Aboriginal children that encouraged face washing at schoolhave been mentioned previously (365,578), and aTRACHOMA CONTROL AND THE SAFE STRATEGY 207 treatment impact by coverage suggested a greaterimpact at six months with coverage over 90%, but this difference was not observed at 12 months(681). 3. Why treat? The threshold suggested by the WHO for the masstreatment of trachoma has been set at 10% forlogistic reasons as it is thought to be cheaper andmore efficient to treat the whole community ratherthan individual families at prevalences of greaterthan 10%. The initial suggestion of using 20% asthe threshold came from programs that usedtopical tetracycline. However, field experience withazithromycin from large programs in Morocco andMali suggested 10% was a more appropriatethreshold for azithromycin distribution for logisticand cost reasons. It is important to remember that the thresholds suggested or recommended by the WHO are broadindicators to provide guidance. Often they aremisinterpreted to say one must not treat (anybody)if the prevalence of active trachoma is less than10%, or that after three years one can just walkaway, or that three years is the longest any areawould ever need to be treated. Both of thesepositions are clearly wrong. One of the issues that arises with prevalence thresholds is the definition of the denominator, orbase population for whom prevalence isdetermined. This has been set at the \"community\"which may typically be 1000 to 5000 individuals inAfrica (3,598). This community or village shouldbe the smallest population grouping for whommass treatment would be given. When prevalence isless than 5% it may not be appropriate to continuecommunity-based mass distribution for a range ofreasons. However, it would seem to be both highlyappropriate and ethical to continue family-basedtreatment. Certainly any families that have childrenwith intense disease, or two children or more withactive disease, should be given family-basedtreatment. Remember that trachoma controlprograms in the UK and the USA were continueduntil every last case of active trachoma haddisappeared. They were not prepared to acceptrates of active trachoma of 5%, or even 1%, intheir children. 4. When to treat? The rate of recrudescence of infection seems to belinked to the starting prevalence of activetrachoma. An argument can well be made for theuse of six-monthly retreatment in areas of highendemicity (greater than 50%) (513,682,683). Inmeso- and hypoendemic areas single antibiotictreatment may be adequate, although success inRombo was based on ongoing selective repeattreatment every six months (226). Interestingly, therisk of having active trachoma six months after206 TRACHOMA Figure 9.26 Mathematical projections of trachoma prevalence derived from empirical pre-treatment, two- and six-month post treatment results (Meleseet al 2004 (526). Reproduced withpermission 2004, AmericanMedical rightsreserved). TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:48 PM Page 206similar study was reported from Ethiopia (687). Enforced face washing at school, with or withoutantibiotic treatment, decreased the amount oftrachoma in schoolchildren over one year. A largerstudy of schoolchildren in 36 Aboriginalcommunities used a factorial design to assesstetracycline drops and face washing. Thisincomplete study did not find a change in the rateof trachoma in schoolchildren at three months(688) and was limited by its very short follow-up. The landmark, randomised control trial on facial cleanliness was undertaken in central Tanzania(393). All members of each village were to receivetopical tetracycline daily for 30 days. Threeintervention villages were randomly selected tohave an additional program focusing on facialcleanliness in children. At the end of 12 months,the proportion of sustained clean faces (on two ormore visits) had increased by more than 60% in theintervention villages. The prevalence of intenseactive trachoma reduced by 38% (oddsratio 0.62, 95% CI 0.40-0.97) in all children inintervention villages irrespective of whether or nottheir face was clean (see Table 9.5). The effect onTF was similar but less marked (0.81, 0.42-1.59).More importantly, in children with sustained cleanfaces the rate of active trachoma was reduced by42% (0.52, 0.47-0.73) and the rate of intensetrachoma was reduced by 65% (0.35, 0.21-0.59)(see Table 9.6). It must be remembered that thiseffect of facial cleanliness was additional to thealready significant impact of the community-wideantibiotic treatment in all villages. Again, the moremarked reduction in severe disease (TI) before the reduction in milder (TF) disease is noted (seeFigure 9.27). Two studies have been recently published evaluating the additional effect of health educationto the distribution of azithromycin. In Ethiopia, 40villages were randomised into four groups (689).All villages received radio health educationmessages. Three groups of villages also receivedazithromycin distribution and \"NGO activities\". Inone of these groups, printed information, educationand communication (IEC) materials weredistributed and in another group of villages, theIEC package was supplemented with a videoprepared by the BBC World Service Trust. TheNGO activities included specific attention to facewashing and environmental improvements andthese were further emphasised in radio and videomessages. The starting prevalence of activeFigure 9.27 Health promotion activities in the Kongwa clean face study included (a) meetings with women and men(b) play acting to demonstrate face washing(c) and (d) examples of face washing(courtesy, Sheila West). 208 TRACHOMA Table 9.5: Odds of trachoma at one year for children in intervention villages compared with control villages (393) Odds ratio (95% CI) for severe trachoma (TI) Odds ratio (95% CI) any the relevant category Table 9.6: Effect of sustained facial cleanliness on trachoma in children at one year (393) Odds ratio (95% CI) for severe trachoma (TI) Odds ratio (95% CI) for any trachoma (TF/I) (b) (c) (d)(a)TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:48 PM Page 208The E component: environmental improvement The E component covers a very broad category of potential activities, and in some ways is the most difficult component of the SAFE Strategy tocomprehend and define. The WHO has producedseveral booklets mentioned above that providemore detail in this area, but most field andprogrammatic work is focused on the provision oflatrines, fly control or the provision of water. Several studies on fly control have been undertaken in The Gambia. In the initial study, twopairs of villages were randomised for one to receivedeltamethrim ultra-low-volume spraying to controlflies (691). eye-seeking Musca sorbens ) had been reduced by 75%, and this was associated with a 75%reduction in the expected seasonal increase in thenumber of new cases of trachoma. A larger studyfollowed and involved seven triplets of villagesrandomised to receive fly control, the provision ofnew latrines, or no additional activities (374).Individuals with intense trachoma treatedwith either tetracycline or sixmonths the number of M. sorbens on children's faces had decreased by 88% with fly control and30% in the villages with new latrines. At sixmonths, the prevalence of trachoma in children in the fly control villages fell from 14% to 7%, in the latrine villages from 11% to 8% andincreased in the control villages from 9% to 10%.Subsequently Emerson showed that the installationof a Gambian Improved Household Latrine coulddramatically reduce the number of M. sorbens (373) and new latrines were usually well received (692). However, a recent large study in a hyperendemic area in Tanzania did not support the addedimportance of fly control to azithromycindistribution (391). In a prospective study, 16neighbourhoods (balozi) were randomised to haveintensive fly control for 12 months. Azithromycintreatment was given to all residents in theseneighbourhoods. Although interventionsignificantly reduced fly counts, in the interventionvillages, there was no significant difference betweengroups of villages in either clinical trachoma orinfection rates determined by PCR (see Table 9.7).This study strongly suggests that intensiveinsecticide spraying to reduce flies gave no addedbenefit over community-based azithromycintreatment (see Figure 9.28). An Ethiopian study showed that mass TRACHOMA CONTROL AND THE SAFE STRATEGY 211 trachoma in these villages ranged between 64%and 72% and at one year prevalence was between22% and 24%. There was no significant differencein trachoma rates between the differentintervention villages, but there was a markedincrease in knowledge about trachoma and eyehealth, although the change in behaviour was lessmarked. This study suggests that even moreintense, grassroots intervention may be required toinfluence health behaviour. The other behavioural study that took place in Vietnam (334) compared two villages that both received S and A components, but the interventionvillage also had a major program of health educationand the provision of health hardware. Over 250houses were provided with latrines, bathrooms,wells and water tanks. Data on facial cleanlinesswere not reported. The prevalence of activetrachoma in children in the \"control village\"dropped from 10.2% to 5.5% at one year and13.8% to 2.3% in the intervention village. Thesefindings support the notion that improved hygieneand facial education are beneficial, although withonly two sites, other interpretations are alsopossible. Ethnographic studies in T anzania have shown that mothers tend to overestimate the amount ofwater necessary to wash a child's face, and thatthey were not able to change their water usepriorities without the consent of their husbands andthe support of the community (368). This implied ahealth education program would need to addressmisperceptions about the quantity of waterrequired, and also address the community as awhole, rather than focus solely on the women.McCauley recounts how, when given a gourd witha litre of water, the men estimated they could washone or two faces, but found they could actuallywash 12. The women thought they could wash fiveor six faces, but actually washed between 30 and35 faces with one litre of water. McCauley goes onto say \"When women learn that the men had beenable to wash fewer faces they commented that menwere always less careful with water than thewomen who had to carry it\" (368). Thecomponents required for a health educationprogram were subsequently developed (690) andused in the clinical trial of facial cleanliness (393). The WHO and members of the Global Alliance have prepared several useful background bookletsdealing with F and E components of the SAFEStrategy (127,589,590).210 TRACHOMA Figure 9.28 Mean fly counts by time in intervention and control balozi in Central Tanzania (Westet al 2006 (391).

It will be most interesting to see if these findings can be replicated in other regions. The full SAFE Strategy was also implemented in an area in southern Zambia (698) and new wellswere provided in 26 villages. Roxithromycin wasused instead of azithromycin due to differences incost. Five doses were administered to each personwith the intent to treat the entire community.Patients were screened for trichiasis and referred forsurgery as required. Health education messagesincluded facial cleanliness and fly control bycleaning villages and penning livestock. Latrineswere dug as required. After two years, theprevalence of trachoma in children under the age of10 had dropped from 55% to 11%. The number ofnew cases of active trachoma declined markedly.There was no documentation of the uptake ofinterventions or changes in parameters such as facialcleanliness. Nevertheless, this study also shows animpressive reduction in trachoma prevalence withthe implementation of the full SAFE Strategy. Two studies of the SAFE Strategy have been reported from Central Australia. One by Ewald wasa longitudinal study in a single community (699)and the other study by Lansingh compared theimpact of A, F and E in one community and A andF in the other (700). In each community surgical services were already available. The first studyshowed a modest reduction in the prevalence ofactive trachoma over the course of intervention,changes in environmental conditions were minimaland the number of houses with completely adequatehealth hardware facilities increased from 0% to 16% (699). The second study is interesting, although limited in statistical power with only two participatingcommunities (700). In both communities, azithromycin coverage was high and out of aTRACHOMA CONTROL AND THE SAFE STRATEGY 213 azithromycin treatment greatly reduced thefrequency with which chlamydial DNA could bedetected in flies (378). One year after treatment23% of flies from untreated villages were PCRpositive compared to 0.3% in treated villages.There was a strong correlation between the PCRpositivity rates in children and flies. A health education study in Mali used a factorial design and found that weekly health educationsessions in addition to topical tetracyclinetreatment led to a significant reduction in the sixmonth incidence of trachoma: 4.2% versus 7.6% (693). The Cochrane Review on this subject concluded that insecticide spray could significantly reduce trachoma, although the provision of latrinesdid not (694). They also concluded that health education may be effective in reducing trachoma. A rather unusual attempt at environmental improvement has occurred recently in WesternAustralia. Under a program of \"sharedresponsibility agreements\" with indigenouscommunities, the Australian Governmentcommitted to provide a petrol pump (gasolinebowser) (695). In exchange, the people in thecommunity agreed to keep their children's facesclean and undertake a range of otherenvironmental activities to reduce trachoma andskin infection (670). After some 18 months, thepetrol tank had not been installed, nor had the rateof trachoma dropped. There are no data availableon the prevalence of facial cleanliness.Subsequently, the Australian Government has madea renewed commitment to review its approach totrachoma and new guidelines have been releasedthat incorporate a more comprehensive approachto trachoma control (696). The SAFE Strategy and the next steps The first reports assessing the effectiveness ofimplementation of the complete SAFE Strategywith all four components have finally beenpublished. The first was a review of the activitiesconducted under the sponsorship of theInternational Trachoma Initiative and was purelyconcerned with process indicators (697). Anevaluation was undertaken in Ethiopia, Ghana,Mali, Morocco, Nepal, Niger, Tanzania andVietnam. In Morocco, the full SAFE Strategy wasbeing implemented across all endemic areas, but inthe other countries only a small proportion of theendemic communities were included. In most countries, only small numbers of trichiasis surgeries were being performed. Therewere usually enough trichiasis surgeons, but theoutput per surgeon was low due to bothcommunity and provider barriers. In mostinstances, the evaluation of surgical outcome wasinadequate. The mass distribution of azithromycinwas usually well done and coverage exceeded 80%in most areas. The review reported variation indistribution policies regarding the treatment ofwomen and young children. The impact of a facial cleanliness and health promotion program was much more variable andoften led to superficial knowledge rather thanbehavioural change. Environmental activities werealso difficult and required strong linkage with othercollaborators such as government agencies andNGOs. Unfortunately, no effort was made toevaluate the impact of these activities on trachomarates as such. The three-year evaluation of the implementation of the full SAFE Strategy in southern Sudan showeda much more encouraging picture (680). Theprogress in four areas was reviewed. Surgicalcoverage was low in all four areas (0.5% to 6%)and obviously needed further work. Antibioticcoverage was relatively high in three of the fourareas with 87% to 94% of houses that reportedreceiving at least one of three annual doses. Theseareas also had a high recall of the facial cleanlinessmessages (72% to 90%). Two areas had reasonableaccess to water, although latrine ownership waslow (3% to 16%) across all four areas (see Table9.8, Figure 9.29). The two areas with a good uptake of antibiotic, facial cleanliness and access to water had a markedincrease in facial cleanliness and a dramaticreduction in active trachoma (TF). The changes infacial cleanliness were less marked in the other twocommunities, as were the changes in TF. Theprevalence of TI was dramatically reduced in threeareas with good antibiotic coverage and facialcleanliness recall. These results are very encouraging and although this evaluation of an ongoing intervention programlacks the precision of a formal clinical trial, it hasgiven very encouraging results in a real world212 TRACHOMA Table 9.8: Uptake of SAFE components and trachoma status at baseline and after three years in southern Sudan (680) Area 1Area 2Area 3Area 20/12/07 2:48 PM Page 212combined population of 403, only one infant was known not to have been treated. An active health education campaign emphasising facial cleanlinesshad been instituted in the schools and radio clips, aposter (front cover) and storyboards were developed. Facial cleanliness rates improveddramatically. In one community, a comprehensive program of environmental improvement was undertaken (700).Sixteen of 22 houses in Community 1 wereearmarked for upgrades in areas related to the ninehealthy living practices outlined in the NationalIndigenous Housing Guide. Briefly, these practicesinclude washing people; washing clothes andbedding; removing waste safely; improvingnutrition; crowding; reducing negativecontact between people and animals, vermin orinsects; reducing the negative impact of dust;controlling the temperature of the livingenvironment; and reducing trauma around thehouse and living environment. Environmentalinterventions consisted of road sealing; demolitionof poorly built or maintained houses, and erectionof appropriately houses; bi-weekly trashcollection; rainwater tanks; house yard fences borderingroads, planting of trees, grass, and native plants inareas where wind and dust were prevalent;earthworks and diversions to create micro-catchments and water ponding; and installation ofdrinking water fountains in the school and healthclinic. These measures were intended to reduce thedust and fly population, and promote appropriatewater use and disposal. In total, theseimprovements cost about A$1.25 million. The rates of active trachoma (TF) dropped in both communities at three months from 48% and50% to 21% and 24% respectively and increasedto 24% and 30% at 12 months. There was nosignificant difference between the two communities(see Figure 9.30). Two conclusions can be suggested from these findings. To control trachoma in these areas, moresustained effort is required, possibly treating alarger area to reduce the impact of \"migration\",retreating every six months and certainlycontinuing A and F for longer periods. Despite theextensive and expensive efforts to improve E, theenvironmental improvements made no discernable difference to the rate of active trachoma over theduration of this study. In addition to these published reports of the success of the SAFE Strategy , the WHO and the Global Alliance have also reviewed annual reportsfrom countries implementing trachoma controlactivities. In April 2006, 36 of 46 countries thoughtto have endemic trachoma had activities underwayand in almost half, Ultimate Intervention Goals(UIG) had been set (598). Particularly impressivewere the achievements in Morocco (597) whereover 10 years, rates of trachoma in children haddropped from in excess of 80% to between 0.2%and 8%. Trichiasis rates in women had also fallendramatically as a result of a very large andcommitted program that operated in the fiveendemic provinces for 10 years. The programstarted with pilot projects in each province andincluded all four components of the SAFE Strategyspread to cover endemic areas in each of theprovinces. Programs were also implemented forwomen's literacy, school rehabilitation, roaddevelopment, income generation and localcommunity development. Although the trachomaprogram had well-focused national advocacy, itbuilt a decentralised administration with grassrootsownership. In addition to the SAFE strategies, otherdevelopment programs were implemented forwomen's literacy, school rehabilitation, roaddevelopment, income generation and localcommunity development. In just over 10 years,Morocco is now close to achieving the goals ofGET 2020 with the elimination of blindingtrachoma as a public health problem. Masstreatment ceased in 2006. Equally impressiveprogress is being made in Iran, Mali and Omanwith the development of large national programs(598). It is proposed that active trachoma may beeliminated as a public health problem from TheGambia, Iran and Oman in 2007; China, Ghana,Myanmar and Nepal in 2010; and Cambodia,Niger, Pakistan and Senegal in 2015. Interesting insights about the relative cost of the different components of the SAFE Strategycome from Ghana (240). They estimated that the S component would cost some US$600,000, the A component US$850,000, the F componentUS$800,000 and the E component US$22.5million. The huge cost for E activities reflects theenormous infrastructure costs in the provision ofwater and sewerage\u201410 times more than theothers combined! This is similar to thedisproportionate cost of E in the Australian studyquoted above. With a more precise focus on facialcleanliness rather than the universal provision ofnew wells and latrines it is quite likely that theresources required for the E component could besubstantially reduced. In addition, the provision ofthese basic services is an essential component ofrural development and other partners, bothgovernment and non-government organisations, aremore likely to assist. This development is clearlylinked to Millennium Development Goal 7. Thoseinvolved with trachoma control activities need toencourage development agencies to build theseactivities into their work and prioritise trachomaareas for development activities. 214 TRACHOMA Figure 9.29 Outcome of three years of SAFE Strategy intervention in southern Sudan (Ngondi 2006 (680)) (a) uptake of antibiotics, facial cleanliness, andenvironmental change interventions, and (b) percentage decrease in TF and unclean face in childrenaged one to nine years in the four intervention areas(reprinted from The Lancet, Vol 368, Ngondi J, OnsarigoA, Matthews F, Reacher M, Brayne C, Baba S, SolomonAW, Zingeser J, Emerson PM.

Trachoma is a public health problem of the highest importance and too much consideration cannot be given to its control JOHN MCMULLEN , 1913 What is the Problem? ITI SH A R D to tell how many people have trachoma, how many people need treatment and how many people need trichiasis surgery. From time to time the WHO has made estimates on the number of people suffering from active trachoma (33,59,102,107,575,701). Althoughthe best available data are used, there are often large gaps in the data and great variation indata quality. However, as can be seen, there has been a dramatic reduction in the estimatednumber of people with active trachoma since 1981 when 500 million people were thoughtto be affected (see Figure 10.1). The most current estimate in 2003 was 84 million (3). Therehas also been a marked drop in the amount of blindness attributable to trachoma. The 1981estimate was six to seven million whereas the estimate in 2003 was 1.6 million (3,702). When assessing the data in 2003, the WHO Scientific Group revised the list of endemic countries to include 56. Several had been excluded as more recent data showed blindingtrachoma was no longer a public health problem. To further refine the estimates provincialor district level data were used where possible. For countries for whom data were notavailable, prevalence data from similar countries were applied to the rural population. Thecurrent estimated numbers are shown in Table 10.1 (3). Global data were used also todevelop maps of the distribution of trachoma (see Figure 2.7) (62). Some have noted that each time a WHO Scientific Group reviews the numbers of people with trachoma, the numbers have declined. This has led to the rueful suggestion that if theseWHO groups met more often, trachoma could be eliminated quite quickly. TRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:48 PM Page 216Data for the two largest countries, China and India, show a high degree of uncertainty. Goodquality recent data were not available, and the2003 estimates were based on some very smallrecent surveys and historical data. As thesecountries have such huge populations, even a smallchange in prevalence makes a great difference inthe estimated number of people affected. In Chinasome 27 million people are estimated to have activetrachoma, nearly one-third of the world's total. A series of surveys and studies to refine theseestimates are underway (see Figure 10.2). It wasestimated that 1.14 million people in India hadtrachoma, although this number also needs to berefined and some have suggested that trachomamay no longer be a problem in India. Informalreports from both countries suggest rates of activetrachoma are now quite low and confined tosmallish pockets, although scarring and trichiasisremain significant problems especially in China. The secular trend Others have drawn attention to the gradual andprogressive decrease in the global numbers ofpeople with trachoma, and have recognised this asa \"secular trend\" associated with a generalimprovement in living conditions associated withsocioeconomic development (703). These non- specific changes led to the disappearance oftrachoma in western Europe and North America bythe middle of the 20th century (74,91) (see also chapter two for more detailed discussion). Similarchanges have been reported from a number ofother areas that have shown rapid developmentsuch as Taiwan (94), India (535), Saudi Arabia(704) and Vietnam (334), and from areas with lessobvious development such as Papua New Guinea(705), The Gambia (346), Malawi (706) and Nepal (707). It is worth dwelling for a moment on the factors that may have contributed to this secular trend thathas led to a tipping of the balance so that trachomahas slowly disappeared. Obvious factors toconsider include the broad range of improvementsin domiciliary and urban hygiene; piped water,good sewage systems, garbage collection and flyreduction or protection; the reduction of closecontact with animals, whether cattle in a ruralcontext, or horses in an urban setting as they werereplaced by cars. Paved roads and dust reductionalso contribute and electrification resulted inimproved housing. The separation of bedroomsfrom living and cooking areas, less crowding inbedrooms and less children sharing beds (reducedfamily size and heating will have both contributed),adequate hot water and indoor bathrooms.Education, especially maternal education with anon-specific emphasis on hygiene, will also haveWILL TRACHOMA DISAPPEAR BEFORE WE ELIMINATE IT ? 219 Figure 10.1 Sequence of WHO meetings on trachoma and WHO estimates of the total number of people with active trachoma since 1956. Figure 10.2 A school exam for trachoma in Yunnan Province (China 1999).TABLE 10.1: Regional and Global Burden of Trachoma, WHO, 2003 (3) WHO REGIONPopulation Population living in TF/TI cases all ages TT cases all ages estimates specifically (% of total) (% of total)year 2000 designatedUN Demographic endemic areasServices 2:49 PM Page 218contributed. These potential changes can only have had an effect on trachoma by reducing the ease orfrequency of transmission. To my mind, the finalcommon pathway here again revolves around facialcleanliness and factors that influence this (see alsochapter six and Figures 10.3, 10.4). To those changes associated with general socioeconomic development the introduction ofantimicrobial agents must be added. In 1949,Lindner wrote \"A few years ago trachoma was oneof the most serious diseases of the eye. That this isno longer the case is due to the sulfonamides\"(560). Their use was credited also with the finalelimination of trachoma in both the UK (65) andthe USA (6). Others have drawn attention to theeffect on trachoma of the widespread use ofantibiotics prescribed for other purposes. Lietmanand his group in Nepal have demonstrated theannual \"background\" use of antibiotics withantichlamydial activity is almost equivalent to anannual round of mass treatment with azithromycin(708,709). Computer models suggest that athreshold level of antibiotic use may reducetransmission rates sufficiently for trachoma toeventually disappear (the so-called \"Allee effect\")(710,711). Given all this, if we sat and waited long enough, it is most probable that trachoma would eventuallydisappear on its own as development slowly creepsto the last of the impoverished villages withhyperendemic blinding trachoma. However , as the Alma-Ata Declaration of 1978 says \"Grossinequities in health status (are) politically, sociallyand economically unacceptable\" (55). Thissentiment was reiterated in the World HealthAssembly Resolution on Trachoma in 1998 (585)(see Table 10.2). More recently Dr Silvio Mariotti, the WHO Co- ordinator of the Global Alliance GET 2020, haspointedly asked \"But can the internationalcommunity afford to wait for the promisedeconomic development while millions more peopleneedlessly become blind from trachoma? Theanswer is certainly no\" (685). However, even if it were possible to eliminate active trachoma today, there is still the generationof children who currently have active trachoma andtheir older brothers and sisters, who already havesufficient scarring to put them at high risk oftrichiasis and blindness. Estimates have suggestedthat the number of people with trichiasis in Egyptmay double or even treble over a 20 to 30 yearperiod due to changing demographics (304,309). Itis quite clear that even after active trachomadisappears, ongoing surveillance for trichiasis andthe provision of corrective surgery will be requiredfor a long time. China and Vietnam are other goodexamples. Certainly in the 1960s the rates oflacrymal surgery in St Louis were said to be twicethose of the rest of the United States because of theresidual effects of previous trachoma. Economic drivers As early as 1951, economic arguments have beenused to promote trachoma control activities. Natafpointed out that \"the control of trachoma andinfectious eye disease is relatively inexpensivecompared with the benefit derived by the country\",although he lacked firm evidence to support thisclaim (52). Initial estimates of the global burden oftrachoma were compromised by uncertaintyaround estimates of the number of people affected(712,713). Using the 2003 estimates, a more refined analysis suggested that the total costs oftrachoma were likely to be US$5.3 billion in 2003dollars (348). This calculation of productivity loss took into account the impact of blindness and lowvision. The presence of trichiasis alone, before itcauses vision loss, is also associated with asubstantial function limitation and disability that isquantitatively similar to that seen from vision lossitself (714). When trichiasis and vision loss occur together the disability is further increased. If thedisability associated with trichiasis was alsoincluded, the estimate of total costs of trachomawould increase by another 50% to almost US$8billion. However , even these estimates may be far too low as they do not fully take into account allthe indirect costs and costs attributable to the lossof well-being (or \"burden of disease\") (715). Frick points out that countries with blinding endemic trachoma are approximately 1.6 timesmore likely to be poor, that is, have an annualaverage value added per agricultural worker of lessthan US$1000 per year in 1998 compared tocountries that did not have trachoma (348).

If azithromycin were available atcurrent generic prices (pills I$0.47 and suspensionI$1.84), it would cost I$4.24 per DALY (717).Using the donated drug, treatment became evenmore cost-effective at I$3.92 per DALY, althoughthe distribution costs remain significant. The masstreatment of 80% of the children with activetrachoma would save some 4 million DALY peryear (717). A study in Tanzania showed thatalthough two-thirds were prepared to pay at leastsomething for azithromycin, one-third would not (719). This resistance would seriously limit an attempt to fund azithromycin distribution by cost recovery methods. A model has also been developed to assess the possible usefulness of a vaccine (720). This modelling showed that in hyperendemic areas, evena relatively ineffective vaccine would haveconsiderable economic advantage. However, as wehave seen in chapter eight, it may be a bitpremature to count too strongly on a vaccine. What tools do we have? The SAFE Strategy The SAFE Strategy concisely brings together thebehavioural, medical and surgical elementsrequired to address trachoma. The specific focus onfacial cleanliness and environmental barrierscoupled with a very potent antibiotic tool give ahighly targeted intervention to reduce both the levelof infection and pressure of reinfection. Thiscoherent strategy is based on solid evidence fromfield research and controlled trials (721). Itprovides an invaluable tool and is a significantadvance over previous attempts to controltrachoma. The identification of facial cleanliness as the key component, or critical pathway, through which theenvironment and socioeconomic conditions impacton trachoma has been a major advance. Thisenables programs to specifically focus on the clearlydefined and achievable goal of ensuring that \"everychild has a clean face\". Similarly, the advent ofazithromycin has been a major advance. Thedistribution of a single annual (or biennial) oraldose of azithromycin is a realistic goal, whereas thelong-term intermittent treatment strategies usingtopical tetracycline or weeks of oral antibioticswere not. Components F and A are the two majoradvances in our knowledge and armamentariumfor the elimination of trachoma by 2020 (see Figure 10.5). Some may see this as an oversimplification, but I firmly believe that we need to focus our attentionon these two issues and address thoseenvironmental and logistic barriers that stop usachieving clean faces and appropriate azithromycindistribution. This is not to say that other factorsalso may be important in a particular area and willneed to be addressed before F and A can be fullyachieved. These powerful tools have been translated into a comprehensive and accessible suite of backgroundteaching and material by the WHO and thepartners of the Global Alliance (127,128,583,587,589,590,722,723). This has made the necessaryinformation and practical technical procedureswidely available and accessible to programmanagers, those in the field and policy makers. The creation of the Global Alliance for the Elimination of Trachoma (GET 2020) is also amajor strength as it brings together the key NGOs,researchers, representatives of nationalgovernments and the corporate sector and WHOexperts. This group can help endemic countries set WILL TRACHOMA DISAPPEAR BEFORE WE ELIMINATE IT ? 223 again emphasises the inverse linkage between aproductive economy and the prevalence of blindingtrachoma, although it does not indicate cause oreffect. Trichiasis surgery has been shown to be highly cost effective. In Myanmar the surgical correctionof trichiasis cost $10 per Handicap Adjusted LifeYear (HALY) (716). In The Gambia, trichiasissurgery was associated with a total lifetimeproductivity gain of US$89 using 1998 dollars(714). Further analysis using international dollars showed trichiasis surgery cost I$13 per DisabilityAdjusted Life Y ear (DALY) and if 80% of those with trichiasis were to have corrective surgery thesavings would be 11 million DALY per year (717).Again, these figures are indicative but they do nottake into account the full cost of vision loss on theone hand, or long-term efficacy of trichiasis surgeryon the other. Modelling of the cost of azithromycin distribution showed that mass distribution wasmore cost effective than targeted householdtreatment (718). The overall cost benefit outcomeof the distribution of azithromycin was verydependent on the cost of the drug itself and on thedistribution process (348). Frick also modelled the effect of the price of azithromycin on the cost-effectiveness of the distribution program.

The ITI has partneredwith the national government, the WHO and othersin the very successful program in Morocco. It hasalso taken a lead in countries such as Mali, Sudan,Tanzania and Vietnam and has continued to workvery closely with the WHO. The ITI, following thelead of the Clark Foundation, has co-sponsored a number of publications expanding the SAFEStrategy. They include Implementing the SAFE Strategy for Trachoma Control (590), the SAFE Strategy Preventing Trachoma (589) and Trachoma Control, A Guide for Program Managers (127) and Guidelines for the Rapid Assessment for BlindingTrachoma (246). Behind the success of the ITI lies the very impressive Zithromax Donation Programestablished by Pfizer to distribute azithromycinworldwide for trachoma control (727). It followedthe Mectizan Donation Program that providesivermectin to treat river blindness. Started in 1987,the Mectizan Program was a trailblazing initiativealmost two decades ahead of its time. It became amodel for public private partnerships (PPP)(728,729,730). With the development of the UNGlobal Fund, the Millennium Development Goalsand the War on Poverty, the value of public privatepartnerships has been widely recognised and muchappreciated. This method brings the private sectorand for-profit corporations together withgovernments and non-government well-being of targetedcommunities. Hank President of Pfizer,recognised that most people with trachoma couldnot afford to buy azithromycin, nor could theirnational governments afford to purchase it for usein national trachoma control programs. Havingalready provided azithromycin at no cost forclinical trials and pilot intervention programs in anumber of countries, in 2003 McKinnellannounced to the United Nations that Pfizer wouldprovide 135 million doses over five years tosupport the global program (731) (see Figure 10.7). The engagement and strong commitment of what is now the world's largest pharmaceuticalcompany makes a tremendous difference to theprospects for success of the SAFE Strategy. In 2005Pfizer indicated that they would continue toprovide donated Zithromax to countries with aserious commitment to the elimination of trachomabeyond 2010 (598). In 2006 some 29 million dosesof azithromycin were distributed (598) and the ITIhad distributed nearly 54 million doses in total (seeTable 10.3, Figure 10.8). One of the problems faced by the GET 2020 program has been the ability to ramp up the WILL TRACHOMA DISAPPEAR BEFORE WE ELIMINATE IT ? 225 targets and provide technical assistance, monitorprogress or undertake operational research torefine or refocus programmatic activities. Theseactivities have added enormously to the likelihoodof the successful elimination of blinding trachoma(see Figure 10.6). Azithromycin, the International Trachoma Initiative and Pfizer In 1984 a meeting was held for the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation to review the currentknowledge of trachoma (582). Two broad areaswere considered: animal models and immuno-pathogenesis, and epidemiologic and field studies.This initiated the interest and support of the ClarkFoundation in trachoma research and they becamemajor players in the field. The trachoma activitiesof the Clark Foundation were guided by theirenthusiastic Medical Director, Joe Cook, who hadpreviously studied schistosomiasis in theCaribbean. The Foundation supported much of theepidemiologic research from the late 1980s and thefieldwork undertaken to assess trichiasis surgery,the use of azithromycin and other environmentalinterventions into the 1990s. They worked closelywith WHO to publish the key SAFE Strategymanuals including Primary Health Care LevelManagement of Trachoma (128), Achieving Community Support for Trachoma Control (583) and Trichiasis Surgery for Trachoma, theBilamellar Tarsal Rotation Procedure (587). In 1998, with the recognition of the usefulness of azithromycin for the treatment of trachoma, PfizerInc. initiated a major donation program to provideazithromycin for use in approved trachoma controlprograms in endemic areas. The Edna McConnellClark Foundation and Pfizer established theInternational Trachoma Initiative (ITI). The ITI is asingle purpose NGO that was established toachieve the global elimination of blinding trachoma(724,725). Initially the ITI had multiple rolesincluding the ongoing support of research activitiescontinued from the Clark Foundation, theinitiation of specific country programs and the co-ordination of the Zithromax (azithromycin)Donation Program. With time, the focus of the ITIhas sharpened, as it has progressively expanded thesize of its existing national programs and expandedthe number of countries in which it worked. In 2005 the ITI distributed over 16.5 million224 TRACHOMA Figure 10.6 Members of the eighth meeting of the WHO Alliance for the Global Elimination of Blinding Trachoma, Geneva 2004.

All this needs to be done in a milieu ofcompetition from multiple worthy causes rangingfrom HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB to the War onPoverty and even the War on Terrorism. Vision 2020 Vision 2020 is a major global initiative jointlyundertaken by the World Health Organization andthe International Agency for the Prevention ofBlindness (IAPB). Whereas the WHO bringstogether national governments and technicalexpertise, the IAPB brings together non-governmentorganisations and professional bodies that work inthe field of eye care and prevention of blindness. Vision 2020: The Right to Sight aims to eliminate avoidable blindness by 2020 (43,57). It has threemajor areas of activity: disease control, humanresource development and infrastructuredevelopment. Under disease control five majorconditions are addressed: cataract, trachoma,onchocerciasis, childhood blindness and refractiveerror and low vision. These conditions were selectedbecause of their public health importance and theavailability of public health interventions to addressthem (733). Vision 2020 has endorsed the programset out for the Global Elimination of Trachoma(GET 2020) and is working with members of theGlobal Alliance to achieve this goal. A strong link between GET 2020 and Vision 2020 is of great importance. Efforts to increase therecognition of the need to prevent vision loss willhelp to raise trachoma awareness, its interventionsand the need for raising funds. Clearly the timing ofthe Vision 2020 Initiative and the close linksbetween this initiative and trachoma are animportant strength, and increase the likelihood ofthe ultimate elimination of blinding trachoma,although close and continuing partnership will berequired. Millennium Development Goals and Neglected Tropical Diseases In addition to the natural linkage with Vision 2020 and prevention of blindness activities, trachoma isalso closely linked with a number of otherdevelopment objectives. Trachoma has obvious tiesto programs addressing poverty, women's rights,children's health or water, and to more specificprograms on neglected diseases, Africa orbehavioural change. The Millennium Development Goals (MDG) were adopted by member countries of the UnitedNations as a strategy to address global disequity by2015 (734) (see Table 10.4) . T rachoma control has a strong link with Development Goal 7, Target 10 \"halve by 2015,the proportion of people without sustainable accessto safe drinking water and basic sanitation\" (734).Access to an adequate water supply is an obviousprerequisite for facial cleanliness and basicsanitation will also reduce fly density (735). Development Goal 8, Target 17 \"in co-operation with pharmaceutical companies provide access toaffordable essential drugs in developing countries\"(734) also relates to trachoma. On the one hand itreinforces the importance of the partnership withPfizer and the Zithromax Donation Program. Onthe other, there is also the need to establish long-term sustainable supplies of affordableazithromycin that reach trachoma areas in everyaffected country. This may require more fullydeveloped public private partnerships to ensure thefull distribution of azithromycin everywhere it isneeded. In many ways trachoma activities also enable and interact with Goals 2 and 3: \"achieve universalprimary education\" and \"promote gender equalityand empower women\" , and ultimately may alsocontribute to the achievement of Goal 1: \"eradicateextreme poverty\" (734). It is vitally important for trachoma control activities to have close co-operation and collab-oration with national governments, internationalorganisations and civil societies that are workingtowards the achievement of the MDGs. It is apowerful way to gain additional collaborators andhelp focus and prioritise resources to address issuesrelating to environ-mental and behaviouralcomponents of the SAFE Strategy. The close linkswith Vision 2020 can only further strengthen thisintersectorial and collaborative approach (736). A new program is being developed by WHO and others to address Africa's neglected tropicaldiseases (737). It too builds on the PPP and theMDGs (729). This program has identified 13 neglected tropical infectious diseases caused byWILL TRACHOMA DISAPPEAR BEFORE WE ELIMINATE IT ? 227 capacity to distribute the donated azithromycin andco-ordinate this with the full implementation of theSAFE Strategy. One constraint is the cost of thedistribution of azithromycin including the initialdelivery to the country. Treatment for one millionpeople fills about 60 pallets or two truck loads. In2007 a cargo-carrying 747 aircraft was required totake the annual doses for 6.7 million people inNiger at a transport cost of about US$250,000(732). Shipping, clearance and storage fees and the considerable cost of donation programs are allborne by Pfizer . The actual in-country distribution costs of road transport and personnel are verysignificant but vary. Typically they may be aroundUS$0.30 per person. This is still US$300,000 permillion people which needs to be found by thegovernment or donors. The costs for S, F and Ecomponents are also considerable. Currently theITI facilitates programs in 12 countries and by2010 plans to increase its coverage withazithromycin and eliminate blinding trachoma inMorocco, Ghana, Mauritania, Nepal and Vietnam.This significant effort will have helped reduce theglobal burden of blinding trachoma by 25%.However, even these ambitious plans would stillleave three-quarters of the problem of blindingtrachoma unaddressed by 2010. Withoutadditional resources we cannot reach our goal. The magnitude of the programs that need to be implemented are quite staggering. The GlobalAlliance reviewed the needs of the 33 worstaffected countries and estimated their UltimateIntervention Goals (597). Over eight milliontrichiasis operations were required and excludingChina, 196 million people needed to be treatedwith azithromycin. If the suspected levels ofendemicity in China were confirmed, an additional156 million Chinese may also need to be treated(597). However, one can have some optimism whenone can see the achievements of other globalprograms for onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis orVitamin A distribution. The elimination of trachoma will clearly require the mobilisation of considerable additionalresources, increased national governmentinvolvement and ownership, the utilisation of226 TRACHOMA TABLE 10.3: ITI program progress since inception 31/12/06) (780) Ethiopia 76,198 facilitates Pfizer Inc's donation of the antibiotic Zithromax\u00ae.

This program includes trachoma and emphasises that theseneglected diseases both occur in poor areas andcontribute to poverty (598). These conditions oftenco-exist and are amenable to rapid impactinterventions. It has been calculated that at anannual cost of some US$0.40 per person, aprogram addressing these diseases could have amajor impact on the health and economic well-being of these disadvantaged African populations.228 TRACHOMA TABLE 10.4: Millennium Development Goals and Targets (734) GOAL 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger Target 1: Reduce by half the proportion of people living on less than a dollar a day.

This may provideanother opportunity for trachoma controlprograms to link and find synergy with otherdisease control initiatives in those areas wherethese diseases co-exist. Many of the other\"tropical\" diseases occur in tropical areas and areassociated with water, onchocerciasis (riverblindness), schistosomiasis and guinea worm. Thustrachoma is more a disease of the deserts. What is the likely outcome? Dominique Negrel has decades of experience oftrachoma in West Africa and worked with theWHO. In a report to the InternationalOrganization Against Trachoma (53), he outlinedthe four essentials he considered necessary for thesuccessful elimination of trachoma: knowledge,techniques, resources and political will. Heconsidered the necessary knowledge and resourceswere already available. They included thesimplified grading; knowledge from epidemiologicsurveys, rapid assessment and moderngeographic systems; bilamellar tarsalrotation; azithromycin; and the integration of thesecomponents into the SAFE Strategy. He regardedthese as the trump cards we held in what was \"thewinning hand to defeat trachoma\" (53). Although these trumps are important they need to be complemented by the other twofactors\u2014resources and political will. Through thecommitment of Pfizer, the Zithromax DonationProgram is a massive resource. The mobilisation bymembers of the Global Alliance and those involvedin Vision 2020 brings additional focus and further resources. A reflection of the political will that exists includes both the specific WHO Resolution onTrachoma in 1998 (585) (Table 10.2) and thereiteration of support for Vision 2020 by the WorldHealth Assembly in 2006 (738,739). Theseformally adopted resolutions at the World HealthAssembly reflect at least the official commitment ofnational governments to address the problem ofblinding trachoma. A further measure of thecommitment of governments of endemic countriesis their ongoing involvement and the reports theyprovide at annual GET 2020 meetings. In 2006some 34 countries provided updated reports.Already half the countries had prepared UltimateIntervention Goals and a number had linkedtrachoma with the Millennium DevelopmentGoals, particularly MDG 7. It would seem thatnecessary resources and political will are starting tocome together with the required knowledge andtechniques. Maybe we do have enough trumps. As we have seen, trachoma disappeared from western Europe and North America in the absenceof specific interventions, or in some countriesalmost despite their small efforts. The relativelylimited trachoma interventions conducted in theUK or the USA, for example, cannot be given fullcredit for the elimination of trachoma in thesecountries, although they were continued until nomore cases of trachoma could be detected. Asimilar situation probably applies to the rest ofEurope. However, in some other countries,specifically targeted trachoma programs may havebeen more important in contributing to thedisappearance of trachoma, although againsocioeconomic development proceeded in parallel.Such countries would include Japan (54), Malta(343), Tunisia (577) and Burma (303). Theseexamples give some cause for optimism that aspecific trachoma intervention will lead to theelimination of trachoma, particularly if it isassociated with parallel developments insocioeconomic status. What is the experience with the SAFE Strategy? Recent reports from the Sudan (680), Zambia(698) and Oman (244) give compelling examples of what may be achievable with the fullimplementation of the SAFE Strategy. In thesereports, rates of active trachoma have beendramatically reduced and in Oman, trachoma hasalmost been eliminated. However, as Negrel pointsout, S and A are probably the easiest componentsof the SAFE Strategy to implement (53). They areboth medically directed and lend themselves to beimplemented and controlled through \"vertical\"programs. On the other hand, F and E relate tobroader health and development issues. Theyrequire \"horizontal\" implementation andintersectorial co-operation. This makes them moreTRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:49 PM Page 228be implemented, for example, a defined group of households, one village, or a group of neighbouringvillages\" (3). Operationally, this may translate intogroups of 1000 to 5000 people. The elimination of blinding trachoma If one is to claim that trachoma has been eliminatedone has to be sure that it has. In internationalhealth this means \"certification\". The process ofdefining the certification of the elimination ofblinding trachoma has been initiated, although ithas not yet been completed (240). The actualcertification will be a complex procedure and manytechnical issues need to be addressed within theWHO. An informal working group identified threepossible categories of countries. These includeCategory A, endemic trachoma in at least onedistrict with a prevalence of TF greater than 5%, or TT greater than one per 1000 (current prioritycountries); Category B, an ongoing problem withTT, but in whom TF was now less than 5% (e.g.United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia); CategoryC, no recent history of TF or TT, althoughtrachoma may have been a problem in the past (e.g.United Kingdom, France and Italy). It had been suggested that to receive certification a country would need to demonstrate that it hadmaintained TF at less than 5% for at least threeWILL TRACHOMA DISAPPEAR BEFORE WE ELIMINATE IT ? 231 difficult to achieve and much more demanding. The S component requires scaling up of resources and close attention to the quality ofsurgery through education and careful post-operative follow-up. The A component needsgreatly increased resources to achieve widedistribution and attainment of the UIG in all areas.Long lasting behavioural changes in F will beneeded to achieve the sustained elimination ofblinding trachoma as a public health problem.Fortunately much of the E component can focusspecifically on those barriers that influence facialcleanliness. Mischievously one might even suggestthat E could be rebadged from \"EnvironmentalChange\" to \"Education\" with the particular focusof facial cleanliness and personal hygiene. Strategicalliances and collaboration with other developmentprograms will be the key to achieve changes in E.We need win/win co-operation with developmentactivities already occurring in endemic areas, andthe encouragement of the prioritisation of endemicareas for new activities for development programs. Ongoing monitoring Edward Jackson (1856-1942) was the doyen ofAmerican ophthalmology. In an editorial in 1925he listed three principal things to be done toeradicate trachoma: the avoidance of the crowdingtogether of infected and uninfected people; the localtreatment of active cases; and most relevant in thiscontext, \"prolonged supervision that will not bewithdrawn until improvement has been secured ...shall continue on the alert for recrudescences andrelapses\" (78). MacCallan was also of the opinionthat \"in a trachomatous country it is necessary toevert the lid of every person whom it is desirous tostate to be free from trachoma\" (4). The propensity for trachoma to have a massive resurgence after apparently successful interventionshas been manifestly demonstrated in countries suchas Ethiopia and Sudan. WHO reports showdramatic reductions in the amount of trachoma inthe 1970s after control programs using intenseantibiotic treatment (740), whereas recent surveys from these areas show the return of disease toextraordinary high prevalences (125,306). Similarly, the WHO program in Morocco led to a significantreduction in trachoma in the 1960s (139) that hadresurged again in the 1980s (245). Similar failures to control trachoma are repeatedly seen inAustralian Aboriginal communities (741,742).Intense antibiotic treatment, sometimes coupledwith health education and environmental messages,can have a short-term impact, but without sustain-able changes including having children with cleanfaces, trachoma will return. The WHO is develop-ing a process for the monitoring of the success oftrachoma control programs and the certification ofthe elimination of blinding trachoma (240). The first step was to create Ultimate Intervention Goals (UIG) (3) (see Table 10.5). The UIG were created to indicate the final targets that need to beachieved by each intervention to eliminate blindingtrachoma. These are dynamic numbers based onthe current best estimates of the burden of disease.The UIG were derived from definitions used toestablish blinding trachoma as a public healthproblem and were aimed at an 80% reductionbelow this threshold prevalence. Operationally , Annual Intervention Objectives (AIO) have beenestablished to build UIGs (see Figure 10.9). The threshold prevalence for TT was set at 1% or greater in the population aged 15 years andabove. This gave a UIG of one case of TT per 1000 of the total population. The thresholdrecommended for community-wide interventionwith A, F and E components for active trachomawas set at a community prevalence of TF of 10%,or higher, in children aged one to nine years. Masstreatment with azithromycin should continue untilthe community prevalence of TF drops to less than 5% when family-based intervention isrecommended. The operational target for A and F was to achieve at least 80% coverage of thecommunity with azithromycin distribution and80% of children with clean faces. Monitoring of the E component depended on education, environmental sustainability andpoverty alleviation which were all closely linked toMillennium Development Goals. For this reason,the monitoring of E should follow the MDGframework for measuring development. In the final instance, prevalences that define this target are set at the \"community level\". Thecommunity was defined as \"the minimum group ofindividuals for which mass trachoma control can230 TRACHOMA Figure 10.9 Percentage of Annual Intervention Objectives achieved in 2006 by 17countries providing coveragedata to WHO (GET 20202007, Cairo \u00a9 2007 WHO,reproduced with permission).

A study of Aboriginalskulls dating back to 14,000 BPshow abnormal changes in the lacrimal fossa of the orbits indicativeof chronic dacryoadenitis (747). Chronicdacryoadenitis can be associated with trachomaand these changes have been interpreted to indicatethe presence of trachoma in these ancientAboriginal remains. In the 1950s and 1960s, extensive efforts were made to remove the remaining family groups ofnomadic Aboriginal people from the WesternDesert. This had become the target area for rocketsfired from the Woomera Rocket Range. In 1957trachoma was found to be frequent in one group of42 people (748). In 1964, another group of 88\"desert Aborigines\" believed never to have hadprevious direct contact with Europeans had theireyes examined; half showed signs of trachoma, fourhad secondary conjunctivitis and another hadentropion (749). Two elders were totally blind andanother had a phthisical eye. Although it is possiblethese groups may have acquired European-derivedinfections indirectly following contact with othergroups of Aboriginal people, these desert peoplecertainly had not lived in the squalor of fringesettlements nor had they adopted a Europeanlifestyle. In white urban Australia, trachoma was a major problem in the last half of the 19th century and ledto the foundation in 1866 of what became theRoyal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital. In 1888 inMelbourne \"trachoma was easily the mostcommon (eye) disease met with, and occupied mostof the time and anxiety of the oculist\" (31).However, by 1909 Sir James Barrett (1862-1945),Chief Surgeon at the Eye and Ear Hospital,commented on the marked decrease in cases oftrachoma (750). He noted that most cases camefrom the Goulburn Valley and northern Victoria. Trachoma was known as \"sandy blight\" throughout Australia. Ophthalmia had been anintegral part of the mythology of the exploration ofoutback Australia. In 1872, the explorer JohnForrest (1847-1914) was temporarily blinded innorth western Western Australia and he named thelow mountain ridge where he was campingOphthalmia Range (see Figure 10.10). A road thatblazes straight across the desert in WesternAustralia, the Gunbarrel Highway, has only oneintersection, Sandy Blight Junction. However, bythe 1920s, even in rural Australia, trachoma wasdisappearing as most Australians moved intoproper housing with separate beds, running waterand adequate sewerage and rubbish removal. By the 1940s trachoma had almost disappeared from Europeans living in south eastern Australia,although blindness from trachoma was the fourthmost common cause and accounted for 4% to 6%of the registered blind (31, 751). However,occasional cases of blindness from trachoma werestill seen and in 1976, the first corneal graft I WILL TRACHOMA DISAPPEAR BEFORE WE ELIMINATE IT ? 233 consecutive years, that it had developed theongoing capacity and systems to handle incidentcases of TT, and that trachoma surveillance andcontrol activities had been incorporated into theongoing public health systems. Such a processwould require targeted prevalence surveysconducted three years after the cessation of massantibiotic distribution. The cost and complexity ofthis certification process was recognised as a majorimpediment and therefore much more work isneeded in this area. To summarise the current position, we seem to have the right tools and many of the resources andthe expression of political will that are needed toactually eliminate blinding trachoma. However, themethods of showing that we have actually achievedthis goal are still to be developed. At this stage, onecould reasonably state: We may therefore venture to conclude on a note of reasonable optimism and at the same time express ahope for the future. In many parts of the world, themost widespread world scourge has been or isreported to be overcome. Efficient methods of therapyare already in use and other still more effective onesmay be expected in the near future. If the nationalcampaigns already underway are continued and co-ordinated and meet with vigorous internationalsupport, our century may perhaps witness thedisappearance of trachoma (59). How much further advanced are we now than they were in 1949, and which century are we talkingabout? Trachoma in Australia It is anomalous that Australia should be the onlydeveloped country listed by the WHO as havingendemic blinding trachoma (3,62). Some have sug-gested that the way things are going Australia maybe the last country to have trachoma. As we willsee, the health and hygiene of Europeans living inAustralia showed parallel changes to those in west-ern Europe and North America and trachomadisappeared from Australia's coastal towns andcities 100 years ago. However, trachoma stillflourishes in Aboriginal communities in outbackAustralia. The past It is unclear when trachoma first reached Australia.One obvious suggestion is that the Europeanmigrants who came to Australia in the 1800sbrought trachoma with them from Europe (743).Certainly in the second half of the 19th centuryconditions in the urban slums or outback shacks ofAustralia were conducive to trachoma. It is possiblethat as Europeans moved into outback areas theytook trachoma with them as well as measles,syphilis and smallpox, all of which spread toAboriginal people. Others have suggested thattrachoma was introduced to Aboriginal people innorthern Australia by Malay traders, and elsewhereby Afghan and Chinese labourers who also came toAustralia in the 19th century (744). The first often quoted European description of Aboriginal people was written in 1688 by WilliamDampier (1651-1715) when he landed on the westcoast of Western Australia: Their eyelids are always half-closed, to keep the files out of their eyes; they being so troublesome here, thatno fanning will keep them off, they will creep intoone's nostrils and mouth too, if the lips are not shutvery close: so that from their infancy being thusannoyed with these insects, (the Aborigines) do neveropen their eyes as other people; and therefore theycannot see far, unless they hold up their heads, as ifthey were looking somewhat over them (745). This commentary shows that eye-seeking flies were common in Australia, but does not necessarilyindicate the presence of trachoma, and it also beliesthe subsequent finding that Aboriginal people havethe world's best visual acuity vastly superior toEuropeans (746). If trachoma were prevalent in Aboriginal communities, it is likely it would have had a devas-tating impact in a non-literate society where goodvision was essential for navigation, hunting and thepassing on of Aboriginal lore and law\u2014all vital forindividual and cultural survival. T o my knowledge there are no Aboriginal stories about widespreadblindness and Aboriginal culture and custom relieson the active involvement of the elderly, not theirmarginalisation due to failing vision. However, two interesting studies have suggested232 TRACHOMA Figure 10.10 The Ophthalmia Range WesternAustralia. 1 20/12/07 2:49 PM Page 232performed as a trainee was on an elderly man from north western Victoria who was blind fromtrachoma. Little information is available about trachoma in Aboriginal people before the 1940s. A Germanmissionary doctor, Erhardt Eylmann, foundtrachoma and blindness to be present in Aboriginalpeople in Central Australia and in 1911, trachomawas considered \"prevalent\" in Western Australiaand Queensland (748). A small survey in 1934reported a 20% prevalence of trachoma amongstAboriginal people on the east coast of Queensland(743). In the 1920s and 1930s many Aboriginalpeople in outback Australia were brought intosettlements or missions and supervised under a verypaternalistic regime. Others lived on extensivecattle properties or stations and worked from timeto time as stockmen or domestic help. Althoughmany still lived semi-traditional lives, their dietchanged to white flour and white sugar. Trachomawas reported to be present in Aboriginal peopleliving on a number of missions in Central Australiabefore the start of the Second World War(748,752). One report gave an overall prevalence of 91% for trachoma (753). The rate of blindness was reported to be 7.9% and drew attention topoor hygiene, dust and flies. Father Frank Flynn (1906-96), an Australian- born London-trained ophthalmologist turnedCatholic priest worked as an army chaplain inDarwin in 1941 (see Figure 10.11). He was the firstto systematically assess the frequent occurrence oftrachoma among indigenous people in theNorthern T erritory, and their welfare became his life's work. Starting in 1942 and continuing afterthe war he surveyed a number of communities inCentral Australia and found trachoma to be verycommon: \"At the age of two or three years a veryhigh percentage of children already show obvioussigns\"(383). Trichiasis and corneal opacity and thedevelopment of blindness were common in olderpeople (752). Further studies were undertakenacross the Northern Territory. Flynn used acombination of the MacCallan Classification and aseverity \"index\" borrowed from Ida Mann.Unfortunately, no age-specific rates for trachomawere provided, but some 20% to 30% of the totalpopulation had active trachoma and the presenceof chlamydia was confirmed by Giemsa cytology.Flynn noted that trachoma tended to be moresevere and cause more blindness in the centraldesert regions and was less severe in northerlycoastal regions. He initiated campaigns with thesystemic distribution of sulphas combined withtopical tetracycline ointment and non-specifichealth education. After World War Two, Dame Ida Mann, a remarkable English ophthalmologist with whomFrank Flynn had worked in London before the war,moved to Perth. She subsequently conductedextraordinary trips throughout the outback,examining and treating many Aboriginal peoplewith trachoma (382) (see Figure 10.12). She foundactive trachoma in 45% of children under the ageof one year and 80% of Aboriginal children agedone to nine years (754). Trichiasis was present in20% of those over the age of 60, and two-thirdshad corneal scarring. She organised sporadictreatment with oral sulphas in outback WesternAustralia. Further studies were undertaken in South Australia that confirmed a high prevalence of bothactive and cicatricial trachoma (755). This groupalso confirmed the presence of chlamydia byGiemsa stain and made the first chlamydial isolatesin Australia. An attempt to culture chlamydia from\"fly emulsions\" was unsuccessful. Trachoma was anotifiable disease in several Australian states (748).Data from 1954 to 1984 show that nine cases werereported in Victoria, some hundreds of cases werereported each year in Western Australia (untilnotification stopped in 1964), and very variablenumbers were reported from the NorthernTerritory and South Australia. Trachoma was notnotifiable in New South Wales, Queensland orTasmania. The reported data are so variable theyadd little useful information, and this is not anuncommon problem with some notifiable diseases. In the 1960s, Fred Hollows took up his position as Professor of Ophthalmology at the University ofNew South Wales and became aware of theimportance of trachoma in Australia (756). Firstworking with the Gurindji people at Wave Hill inthe Northern Territory and then with Aboriginalpeople living around Bourke in far western NewSouth Wales, he cajoled the federal government andthe Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologistsinto establishing the National Trachoma and Eye 234 TRACHOMA Health Program (the \"Trachoma Program\") (757). In 1967 a constitutional referendum gave full citizenship to Aboriginal people. The church-runmissions were closed and replaced by governmentfunds and control. Indigenous people received thevote, pensions and unemployment benefits andunrestricted access to alcohol. Between 1976 and 1978 the NTEHP visited every indigenous community in Australia andexamined over 62,000 indigenous people andnearly 40,000 others (103) (see Figure 10.13). Itgave a clear picture of the number of peopleaffected with trachoma and its distribution. TheNTEHP showed the widespread presence oftrachoma in Aboriginal Australians throughoutrural and outback Australia. This showed a higherprevalence of trachoma in central desert areas,lower prevalences in urban areas, and more settledrural areas in the south-east and coastal areas (103)(see Figure 10.14). The NTEHP also treated nearly25,000 people for trachoma and established clearguidelines and recommendations of what wasneeded to be done to eliminate trachoma. Following the report of the NTEHP, statetrachoma committees were organised to supervisethe running of ongoing trachoma control activities.Initially these committees were under federalsupervision, but later they were devolved to thestates with Aboriginal leadership (758). IncreasingAboriginal and community control was sought andmany Aboriginal organisations includingcommunity-controlled Aboriginal Medical orHealth Services were established. Some committeesin South Australia, Western Australia, the NorthernTerritory and Queensland continued into the 1990sand they became increasingly concerned with theprovision of visiting specialist eye care andspectacles and trachoma activities were morelimited. A meta-analysis of data collected in theNorthern Territory over a 40 year period showedmore evidence of survey variation than a consistentchange in trachoma rates (759). The present In 1997 I prepared a report on indigenous eyehealth for the Commonwealth Government (758).In addition to considering the broad issues relatingto ocular health, information was specifically WILL TRACHOMA DISAPPEAR BEFORE WE ELIMINATE IT ? 235 Figure 10.11 Frank Flynn at the time of his investiture as a Companion of the Order of Australia by Administrator John England at Government House in 1995 (NT govt. photographer,Northern Territory Library and Information Service \u00a9 NTL).

Trachoma had decreased significantly in some areas; in some of the largertowns and regional centres trachoma had almostdisappeared. In other areas, active trachoma wasless common, although the elders still had scarredeyelids and trichiasis. However, it was devastatingto return to some communities in the WesternDesert and Central Australia to find thathyperendemic rates of trachoma had not changedsince I first visited those communities with theNTEHP 20 years before. In one community in1997, 70% of the children had trachoma. Isummarised these observations: Although the prevalence and intensity of trachoma may have decreased in some areas, other areas showlittle or no improvement over the last 20 years. Manyseem to have disregarded trachoma and current dataon active trachoma underestimate the problem as theyoften come from incomplete cohorts of older children.Information on trichiasis was grossly inadequate andin most areas, cases were not actively sought. Anintegrated primary health approach was required tomanage trachoma. This should combine screening,azithromycin antibiotic treatment, personal hygieneand environmental improvement. This approach hasbeen codified by the World Health Organization in'SAFE strategy'. It is unconscionable that trachomaremains a blinding disease in Australia (758). This review recommended that eye care should be delivered to indigenous Australians through aregional public private model. Three specificrecommendations were made with regard totrachoma. These related to the development ofclinical practice guidelines, the provision ofazithromycin treatment through the NationalPharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and the need forfurther improvements in the regional delivery ofhousing, infrastructure and the resources tomaintain these (758). The Report alsorecommended the establishment of a nationalinformation network to provide a two-way flow ofinformation as a conduit of technical informationto those working in the field and to gather centraldata on both eye care activities (process) and ocularstatus (outcome). The most straightforward of these recommendations, the listing of azithromycin, was achieved in 1998 (1). Specialist eye healthguidelines for use in Aboriginal and Torres StraitIslander populations that included a section on themanagement of trachoma appeared in 2001 (760).These guidelines advocated the use of the WHOSimplified Grading, the implementation of theSAFE Strategy including the bilamellar tarsalrotation procedure, mass distribution ofazithromycin and emphasis on facial cleanliness.They also recommended the collection of a basicset of health information reiterating the priorrecommendation. Sporadic reports suggest fluctuating rates of ongoing trachoma in Aboriginal communities. Forexample, one report used data collected over 24years by three surveys each using different gradingsystems (307). It showed a possible decrease inactive trachoma in two to nine year olds fromabout 50% to 30% in these communities. A reportof school screening between 1999 and 2003suggested only 15% of children had activetrachoma (761). However, a population-basedexamination in some of the same communities in2000 showed a point prevalence of active trachomain children aged one to 10 years to be 49% (311).Moreover, over a one year period up to 79% of thechildren had TF on at least one occasion. Thesedifferences that highlight the vagaries of sampleselection are further reinforced by another reportusing data collected over 12 years (762). A population-based report from 11 communities in the Pilbara showed TF rates in children under theage of five ranged from about 12% to almost 100%(763). The prevalence of trachoma was lowest incommunities closer to the coast. This report alsostressed that 40% of Aboriginal people lackedaccess to a shower, toilet or washing machine andthat heated water was almost universally absent. Ameasure of the appalling standards of ocular\"promiscuity\" and hygiene prevailing in thesecommunities was an outbreak of non-sexuallytransmitted gonococcal conjunctivitis that infectedpeople from north western Australia through theNorthern Territory and into South Australia (764). Reports of trichiasis were also sporadic, but prevalences are still remarkably high despite thepresence of ophthalmic surgical services. In theKimberley, the overall regional prevalence in thoseover the age of 50 was 2.8%, although in somecommunities trichiasis rates ranged up to 11%(765). Another report from Central Australia WILL TRACHOMA DISAPPEAR BEFORE WE ELIMINATE IT ? 237 Figure 10.14 The prevalence of follicular trachoma amongst Aboriginal children found by NTEHP 1976 to 1978 and reported between 1989 and 1996 (Taylor 1997; Eye Health in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Communities, Hugh R.

In South Australia, rates of trachoma of1.3% have been recently reported (340). Visitingophthalmologists provide periodic eye care to thosein remote areas (767). People seen with cataract,trichiasis or diabetic retinopathy who needtreatment are usually transferred to a regional orstate centre for surgery. This means that trichiasiscan be surgically corrected if detected, but trichiasisis not systematically sought. In Adelaide, rates oflid surgery in Aboriginal people are six times higherthan in non-Aboriginal people (768) and most lidsurgery in Aboriginal people was for trichiasis. A recent population-based survey in one community in Central Australia found the rate ofTF to be 55% in children aged one to nine years(341). In adults over 40, 74% had TS, 11% hadTT and 5% had CO. Bilateral blindness was foundin 2% of adults over 40, and 40% was due totrachoma. Antibiotic treatment programs for trachoma were also rather sporadic and most focused onindividual interventions. Some programs hadimplemented targeted treatment of children withazithromycin, although the impact of thisintervention was quite limited (310,742,769). A trachoma control program has operated in the Kimberley for 15 years (742,770) treatingschoolchildren with trachoma and some familymembers. And yet the overall prevalence of 23%active trachoma in 2005 had not changed from1991! (742). Data for 2005 were available for 32of 38 schools; 18 had prevalences greater than20% and only four had no trachoma. These datashow that despite good intentions and efforts, theineffectiveness of inappropriately directedazithromycin treatment was compounded by thefailure to implement other components of the SAFEStrategy (see Figure 10.15). They stand in starkcontrast to the concurrent reports from the Sudan(680) or Zambia (698) (see Figure 10.9). Two short-term programs in Central Australia have tried to implement the full SAFE Strategy(699,700). Trichiasis control activities had beenimplemented previously. Antibiotic coverage wasrelatively limited in the first study and a realadvance in the improvement of the E componentwas not made (699). The proportion of houses with completely adequate facilities increased from 0to 16% (see Figure 10.16). However , the otherstudy showed no added benefit from a significantand comprehensive effort of environmentalimprovement over and above that obtained from Aand F (700). Both of these studies show that for a sustained reduction in trachoma a more sustainedeffort would be required. They also suggested thatin hyperendemic areas treatment every six monthsmay be preferable. Further , given the high mobility of many Aboriginal people, regional-basedinterventions would be preferable rather thanfocusing on the treatment of single communities.They also highlight the abysmal state of healthhardware in many of these communities. A muchbigger investment in time and effort is thereforerequired. Interestingly, a dramatic reduction in skin infections and otitis media was reported followingthe building of swimming pools in two Aboriginalcommunities (771). Unfortunately no thought wasgiven to assessing trachoma. Swimming poolsprovide an easy way to wash, but also provideexercise, recreation and a community focal point(see Figure 10.17). A \"no school no pool\" policyalso improved school attendance. This findinggenerated great interest and may be a way ofaddressing facial cleanliness, personal hygiene andtrachoma. This approach may be more successfulthan the promise of the installation of petrol pumps(695,772). A study to specifically examine theimpact of swimming pools on trachoma rates wasattempted but thwarted by prolonged delays ininstalling pools (341). In 2004 the report of a review on the implementation of the Aboriginal Eye HealthProgram was released (767). This review foundthat despite the presence of several Australianguidelines recommending trachoma control withthe SAFE Strategy, these recommendations had notbeen systematically implemented. They noted thatlittle data had been collected and these data werehighly variable in quality and form. Nevertheless,the review recognised that trachoma still occurredat a high prevalence in some communities and thepresence of chlamydia was confirmed by PCR.They also found that azithromycin distributionactivities had been conducted in some communitiesfor upwards of 10 years without any documentedadverse effects. They recognised the highprevalence of trichiasis occurring in somecommunities, and that many people, including238 TRACHOMA WILL TRACHOMA DISAPPEAR BEFORE WE ELIMINATE IT ? 239 Figure 10.15 Reported prevalence of trachoma in schoolchildren in the Kimberley region, 1991 to 2005 (dataredrawn from Johnson GH et al.

The key to adequate housing is regular and ongoingmaintenance and the provision of sufficient houses so that each familyhas their own functional house. some ophthalmologists and public health practitioners, did not necessarily give trachomacontrol activities a high priority. Their complex report contained some 38 recommendations of which only one related totrachoma: Trachoma control should be the responsibility of government-run and regional public health units andbe organised on a regional basis where populationmobility is high. Primary health care services should beinvolved in the detection and treatment of trachomaunder the co-ordination of public health units (767). The Commonwealth Government acknowledged the need for cross jurisdictional arrangements toaddress trachoma and for a \"... nationallyconsistent approach to collection and reporting ofprevalence data\" (773). The government alsoindicated that trachoma activities could beincorporated into ongoing well-baby and well-adults health checks. It was decided that theCommunicable Diseases Network Australia wouldbe the body to co-ordinate Australia's trachomaactivities. Endemic trachoma persists in Aboriginal communities because poor personal andcommunity hygiene permit the frequent spreadingTRAC_textMASTER_HH_20-12-07:Layout 1 20/12/07 2:50 PM Page 238Figure 10.17 Aboriginal children in swimming pools TOP children demonstrating how they blow their nose as part of facial cleanliness in front of a poster announcing the future construction of a swimming pool (courtesy, Heathcote Wright) LEFT children in the same community improvising while they wait (courtesy, Heathcote Wright) ABOVE RIGHT the community club pool in Oenpelli, NT. WILL TRACHOMA DISAPPEAR BEFORE WE ELIMINATE IT ? 241 TABLE 10.6: Summary of key recommendations from guidelines for the public health management of trachoma, CDNA, 2006 (776) Recommendation: Organisation Trachoma control should be organised and run on a regional basis by regional population health units in conjunction with primary health care services, community representatives and other key stakeholders. Priority should be given to areas with the highest number or the highest prevalence of active trachoma.Data should be collected in accordance with the national trachoma dataset. Surgery The detection and management of trichiasis should be organised regionally with full stakeholder involvement.The burden of trichiasis should be quantified in endemic regions.Where trachoma is or has been endemic, Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander people aged 40-54 years should be screened every t wo years and those aged 55+ years should be screened annually for trichiasis as part of an adult health check.Patients with trichiasis should be referred to an ophthalmologist for surgery and then followed up annually. Antibiotics The minimum target group for active trachoma screening should be Indigenous children aged 5-9 years living in communities/towns where trachoma is endemic. Annual screening for active trachoma is recommended until active trachoma prevalence is < 5% for five consecutive years.All children with active trachoma (TF and/or TI) should be treated with single-dose azithromycin.If the prevalence is 10% and there is no obvious clustering, all children aged six months to 14 years and all household contacts should receive single-dose azithromycinIf the prevalence is 10% and cases are obviously clustered within several households and health staff can easily identify all household contacts of cases, single-dose azithromycin is recommended for all household contacts. Community-wide treatment is not required . If the prevalence is < 10%, single-dose azithromycin is recommended for all household contacts.Antibiotic treatment should be completed within two weeks of screening.In regions where population mobility is high, screening and treatment activities should be completed in as short a timeframe as possible to minimise reinfection and achieve high coverage. Facial cleanliness Facial cleanliness in children should be promoted by including regular face-washing as part of a holistic personal hygiene prog ram. Environmental health Environmental health, school and health promotion staff should be involved as key stakeholders when regional population health units and primary health care services plan and implement trachoma control activities so that 'F' and 'E' strategies appropriate indiv idual 240242 TRACHOMA of infected eye secretion from one child to another (1) (Figure 10.18). If trachoma is to be reduced inAboriginal communities, the swapping of infectedeye secretions must be stopped by improving livingconditions (as occurred 100 years ago forEuropeans living in Australia). Australians living inurban and rural areas insist on the basic facilitiesrequired for healthy living, that is, a house,electricity, clean running water, sewerage, sealedroads and rubbish collection. Reports indicate thathalf the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territorydo not have adequate housing (774,775), and one insix communities do not have potable water. Thisbasic infrastructure is provided by local and stategovernments to everyone else in Australia. However,when one considers the conditions encountered inthe communities of American Indians in the southwest of America in the 1960s and how trachomawas subsequently eliminated with a sustainedcommitment (80), a similar outcome in Australiahas to be possible and is sorely needed. The future In 2006 the Australian Government took somesignificant steps in the recognition and prioritisationof trachoma control activities. The most notablewas the publication of the long-awaited nationalguidelines for the public health management oftrachoma in Australia (776) (see Table 10.6). These guidelines establish minimum best practice to be applied throughout Australia for the controlof trachoma and provide recommendations to befollowed by regional population health units in eachstate and territory . They advocate the co-ordination of activities with appropriate groups and the stronginvolvement of the local community. They provideclear guidelines for the implementation of the SAFEStrategy including the distribution of azithromycin.The Australian guidelines have some specific areasof difference from WHO recommendations,particularly with regard to the use of masscommunity treatment. Nevertheless, they are astrong forward move. The government will alsosupport the development of a national trachomadataset, monitoring of activities (696) and trainingof an appropriate workforce. A study of the barriers in implementing a trachoma control program in northern Australiashowed that a successful program needed inputfrom government, regional health networks, localhealth staff and the community (341). Althoughinput and engagement are required at each level, thekey driver for a successful program was seen to bethe presence of government policy and priorityfollowed by the commitment of adequate resourcesfor use at the more peripheral levels. Without these,those in the more peripheral levels would either notcommit to the program, or become despondent andgive up. At the local level, the provision of adequatetime and staff to undertake trachoma activities areessential. Data collation and feedback were alsoimportant. A review of the distribution of trachoma in Australia highlighted the variable way in which data had been collected. The reported communityprevalence of active trachoma varied from 5% to50% (741) although others still report activetrachoma in 60% or 70% in some schoolchildren(742). The reported prevalence of trichiasis rangesfrom 1% to 19%. Overall, these encouraging moves by the Australian Government to address trachoma arematched by other developments in the delivery ofAboriginal health. These include an increased focuson targeted operational research (777), moreeffective use of Aboriginal health workers (778)and the appropriate use of specialist outreach visitsto remote Aboriginal communities as an effectivedelivery of specialist care (779). The latter isparticularly relevant in the provision of trichiasissurgery. What is really required to eliminate blinding trachoma in Australia is an ongoing politicalcommitment at all levels of government. On aglobal scale we clearly have the tools and inAustralia the resources are available. What isneeded to eliminate trachoma as a blinding problemis sustained political will and the commitment to follow through.
