I've been extremely blessed and pleased with my choice to become a Hy-Vee pharmacist. I've had the opportunity to make an immediate impact on the lives of my patients. Every day I am allowed the fl exibility and autonomy to make a difference in their health needs. Being a pharmacist involves much more than simply dispensing medication. It allows me to be an integral part of the overall health care team. I have the ability to assist my patients and their physi-cians and insurance companies in determining the best courses to take in the treatment of medical problems. As a pharmacist, my patients have immediate access to me to discuss any questions or concerns. In the process, I have gained many meaningful relationships within my community. Among the customers I've been able to help, a woman named Neva stands out. When she needed help deciding which Medicare drug plan would be best for her, I prepared some information. But she could not get out to the pharmacy, so I took the material to her house to explain it to her after I got off work. We did our business, then we spent an hour visiting about her late husband and all the traveling they did. I really enjoyed my evening with her. People like Neva make my job so enjoyable. As you read through this issue of Hy-Vee Seasons, you'll discover more about our medical services in \"Prescription for Good Health,\" page 20. Your well-being is also the topic of the story \"Healthy @ Hy-Vee,\" page 58, which encourages all of us to eat better, engage in physical activi-ties and develop strong social lives. There are also stories about foods, and recipes, with an emphasis on good nutrition. Reading through the following pages will be time well spent. Here's my prescription: Relax and enjoy. Tracey 04-11 Super Foods2-AV.indd 4 12/1/11 4:20 PMAmazing Super Foods Though you may have heard of super foods, you may wonder what they are. These are the fruits, vegetables, lean meats and other foods that not only taste fresh and delicious, but are also highly nutritious. Rich in the powerful nutrients that your body needs, these foods naturally offer an array of disease-ghting substances that keep you healthy. By eating super foods, you can fuel your immune system with infection- and disease-ghting power. The immune system is a network of cells, tissues and organs that work together to defend the body against such invaders as germs and infectious substances that cause disease. Studies show a number of links between super foods and the effects they have on the immune system to protect against health problems. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, certain super foods have the ability to reduce risks of heart disease, cancer, stroke, high blood pressure, osteoporosis and birth defects. A popular media term today, super foods entered the language almost 100 years ago as scientists discovered that some foods are nutrition winners and others losers. Dietitians, food scientists and other professionals now prefer the term \"functional foods\" for nourishment offering signicant health benets. GET HEALTHY, NATURALLY The scientic side of super foods may sound complicated, but making them a part of your diet is simple. Most of these natural, unprocessed fresh fruits and vegetables, lean meats, low-fat dairy and hearty whole grains are readily available at Hy-Vee. Generally, these nutritious choices can be found by shopping along the outer walls, or perimeter, of your local store. \"Natural, whole foods give your body the nutrients that are needed to stay healthy and ght disease,\" says dietitian Amanda Devereaux of the Hy-Vee in Johnston, Iowa. \"Eating these foods every day can help you feel energized and upbeat.\" A diet of naturally healthful super foods beats out a diet of high-fat, high-calorie, sugary foods. \"Eating a diet of unhealthful processed foods can leave you feeling sluggish because you don't get the nutrition needed to keep going,\" Amanda says. Instead, put foods such as barley, quinoa and other ancient grains in your diet. Each food group has super foods to pick from, and all of them are good-tasting and easy to include in meals and snacks. While all provide something healthful, some boast extra benets. CITRUS SUPERSTARS One group of super foods that offers particularly strong health benets are citrus fruits, especially tangerines, oranges and grapefruit. These fruits contain powerful disease-ghting antioxidants and phytonutrients. \"Citrus fruits are excellent sources of vitamin C, which boosts the immune system,\" Amanda says. \"They're also packed with nutrients that can help heal wounds, lower cholesterol, ght colds and flu, decrease inflammation, plus reduce risk of cancers.\" Tangerines are high in pectin, a soluble ber that reduces the cholesterol in blood and can aid weight loss by providing a full feeling. Oranges are a good source of folate, which helps form healthy new cells and provides energy for your body. Pink grape-fruit has a high concentration of lycopene, the pigment that gives the fruit its color. Lycopene supplies antioxidants, which guard against cell damage that promotes heart disease and cancer. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about drugs that may interact harmfully with grapefruit juice. Citrus is just the start, of course. In the pages that follow are 30 more super foods. All are good for your body.When it comes to making your body stronger, certain foods have \"super powers.\" Including these natural foods in your daily diet provides an array of health benets\u2014and they're super tasty. Whether you're fending off a cold, trying to lower cholesterol or reducing the risk of cancer, count on these foods to pack a powerful punch. TEXT MARIA GIFFORD PHOTOGRAPHY ADAM ALBRIGHT AND TOBIN BENNETT seasons hy-vee.com 5 04-11 Super Foods2-AV.indd 5 12/1/11 4:20 PMEat regularly from this variety of beneficial super foods, which support good health, clear thinking and stronger bodies. All of these fruits, vegetables, nuts and other foods are rich in nutrients. 1. Spinach is a nutritional powerhouse, bursting with folic acid, vitamins C and K, iron, carotenoids and bioflavonoids. It also has a good dose of lutein, a weapon against cataracts and macular degeneration. 2. Chia seeds are a plant source for omega-3 fatty acids, which are good for heart and artery health. They are also high in antioxidants, fiber and minerals. 3. Broccoli is an excellent source of vitamins A and C. It also has vitamin K to build bones, and fiber to help with weight control and healthy digestion. 4. Kiwi, one of the most nutrient-dense fruits, is loaded with antioxidants, potassium, vitamin A and a full day's supply of vitamin C. It's a good source of fiber and one of a few fruits that provide vitamin E, an important antioxidant.5. Berries, especially blueberries, pack a powerful nutritional punch in tiny packages. Loaded with antioxidants and phytonutrients, berries are low in calories yet high in fiber and water. 6. Dark chocolate (with 70 percent cacao or more) lowers bad cholesterol (LDL) and increases good cholesterol (HDL). 7. Skim milk is a fat-free dairy food that's rich in calcium and high in protein, potassium and vitamin D. Bone health experts call a glass of skim milk a \"complete nutrition\" food. 8. Sweet potatoes, in bright orange, are high in vitamins A and C, plus calcium and potassium. To cut back on fat and sodium, a baked sweet potato with few or no toppings is a good choice with dinner. 9. Green tea contains catechins, the powerful antioxidants that target free radicals which damage DNA and contribute to cancer and heart disease. Green tea may inhibit the growth of cancer cells. 10. Tomatoes have a higher concentration of lycopene than any fruit or vegetable.Being amply supplied with this vital cancer-fighting antioxidant also provides the bright color. Interesting to know: Cooked tomatoes are higher in lycopene than fresh tomatoes. 11. Eggs offer quality protein along with 12 vitamins and minerals\u2014including choline, which is good for brain development and memory. Eggs are a nutritious, versatile, economical super food.

Fat-free Greek yogurt has double the protein and half the sugar of regular yogurt. Because it has less lactose than regular yogurt, it's also easier to digest. Look for Greek yogurt with probiotics\u2014cultures that improve digestive health. 13. Nuts are high in protein and are loaded with heart-healthy fats, disease- fighting antioxidants and lots of fiber. To keep fat intake down, choose nuts in the shell. Taking time to shell them slows down eating and helps with portion control. 14. Beans are loaded with insoluble fiber\u2014to help lower cholesterol\u2014as well as soluble fiber, which is filling and aids healthy digestion. Beans are low in fat while high in protein, carbohydrates, magnesium and potassium. 15. Peppers\u2014mild, hot or super hot\u2014 contain phytochemicals that have strong disease-fighting antioxidants. Peppers of all colors and flavors are among the richest sources of vitamins A and C.

Garlic is a welcome reminder that something mouthwatering is about to be served. The aromatic fl avor of garlic ranges from mild to intense, and this herb is a critical ingredient that adds dimension to numerous dishes\u2014from chicken to bread to potatoes to hummus\u2014in countless savory recipes. It awakens ordinary foods, allowing diners to enjoy them in new, delicious ways. A bland dish becomes lively; a lively dish becomes spectacular. Sometimes called the \"stinking rose,\" garlic belongs to the Allium class of vegetables that includes onions, chives, leeks and scallions. Garlic, which is easy to grow and can be cultivated year-round in any temperate climate, accounts for more than 400 varieties grown worldwide. Much of the garlic produced in the U.S. is grown in Gilroy, California, which calls itself \"The Garlic Capital of the World.\" All garlic falls into two categories: hardneck and softneck. Both types have the same nutritional properties. Most garlic in American markets is softneck garlic, speci cally artichoke garlic, which is very easy to grow and stores well. The distinctively familiar taste of garlic as well as its nutritional value is contained in the cloves\u2014from 10 to 20 in each bulb\u2014huddled tightly together and bound by thin papery skin and a root. THE WONDER DRUG Belief in its health bene ts is one reason that garlic has been cultivated worldwide for thousands of years. Today we are catching up on that knowledge. Research con rms many health bene ts of garlic, including that it acts as a natural antibiotic. On contact, garlic can destroy such viral infections as chicken pox, measles, mumps, rabies and scarlet fever. One study shows that the vapors from nearby crushed garlic may kill bacteria up to eight inches away in just a few hours. The National Cancer Institute reports that \"preliminary studies suggest that garlic consumption may reduce the risk of developing several types of cancer.\" Studies show that garlic reduces the size of tumors and helps white blood cells defend against and kill cancerous cells. According to demographic surveys, populations known to have above-average consumption of garlic show lower incidences of many types of cancer. Garlic, also known to control fevers, is used as a remedy for colds, coughs, sore throats and fl u. This favorite kitchen herb is a good source of manganese, vitamin B 6, vitamin C and selenium. MORE HEALTH BENEFITS Amber Jaeger, dietitian at a Dubuque, Iowa, Hy-Vee says, \"Garlic may help lower total cholesterol and increase HDL (good) cholesterol, which helps reduce the risk of heart disease.\" Garlic may play a role in preventing blood clots and reducing plaque buildup in arteries. \"It acts as an anticoagulant and has a Wherever you go around the world, the familiar, enticing aroma of garlic can instantly transport you home.

People taking blood- thinning medications should avoid eating large amounts of garlic. Talk to your doctor if you have any concern about this. WHAT TO BUY & HOW TO USE For maximum nutritional bene ts, it's best to consume fresh, preferably organic, garlic. Hy-Vee carries fresh garlic year-round. Amber says, \"Garlic in fl ake, powder or paste form has less desirable fl avor and fewer health bene ts compared to fresh.\" When buying, avoid bulbs that are shriveled or have begun to sprout. \"Look for plump cloves with unbroken skins,\" Amber says. \"Give the bulb a slight squeeze to make sure it's plump and rm but not damp.\" Bulb size has little to do with quality. How much garlic should you eat? \"Recommendations vary from half a clove to ve per day,\" Amber says. \"I recommend consuming at least half a clove once a day with meals for heart-health bene ts.\" Adding garlic to the menu is easy. Amber suggests cutting the tip off a clove then rubbing the clove on toast for garlic bread. For garlic-mashed potatoes, add softened cloves to just-cooked potatoes, then whip them together. Finely mince cloves to release full fl avor, then add to vinaigrettes to drizzle on salads and vegetables. Or roast whole cloves with a pan full of assorted root vegetables for a mellow, sweet taste. And don't let garlic breath be a concern; simply counteract it by munching fresh parsley. Or consider garlic supplements. Amber recommends a powder form of garlic because oil alone doesn't contain the same disease- ghting components of raw. Again, check with your doctor to make sure supplements will be helpful. STORAGE HOW-TO Store bulbs in a cool, dark place. Brown paper bags and garlic keepers are handy. \"Whole garlic bulbs should stay fresh about a month when stored properly,\" Amber says. \"Once the bulb is split open, shelf life is reduced to just a few days.\" After garlic is peeled, it can be frozen, although doing so reduces both fl avor and nutritional value. Peeled garlic cloves store well in wine or oil in the refrigerator. Never store garlic in oil at room temperature because botulism bacteria can form. \"Chop garlic with a pinch of salt. The salt will help absorb the ga rlic ju i c e s, and the abrasive grains help break down the garlic more easily.\"From Chef Curtis Stone When booking for fresh garlic, pick out rm, tight and When booking for fresh garlic, pick out rm, tight and When booking for fresh garlic, heavy dry bulbs. pick out rm, tight and heavy dry bulbs. pick out rm, tight and 14 seasons health 2012 owing with fresh herbs and vegetables, this offers a garden taste along with beef and pasta.

Peel off as many papery layers from the bulb as possible, then separate the number of cloves needed. To remove papery peel from a clove, slice off the root end. Lay the clove flat-end down on a stable surface and place the broad, flat side of a knife on top. Keeping clear of the sharp edge, press down firmly. The papery peel should slip right off. Then slice, chop or mince for the recipe. To slice: Cut widthwise slices with a small sharp knife. To chop: Use a chef 's knife in a rocking motion to chop through a small mound of sliced garlic. To mince: Use a chef 's knife as for chopping, except chop much finer. Or use a garlic press, see below . One clove equals about \u00bd teaspoon minced garlic. To press: Place individual cloves (with or without skins) in a garlic press, close and squeeze to produce finely minced garlic with juices intact. A press squeezes out garlic while leaving papery skin behind; just pluck it out and discard. PREPARING GARLICHere's how to oven-roast garlic to bring out its sweet and nutty\u2014almost buttery\u2014flavor and creamy texture. 1. Peel away the papery dry outer layers of skin from a garlic bulb, leaving skins of cloves intact. Using a sharp knife, cut off only about \u00bd inch of the pointed top of the bulb, leaving the bulb intact while exposing individual cloves. 2. Place garlic bulb cut end up in a custard cup, a garlic baker or on a double-thickness of foil. Drizzle with olive oil, then season with salt and pepper. Cover with foil or lid or bring foil up around bulb and fold edges, loosely enclosing while allowing steam to build. Roast at 400\u00b0F about 25 minutes or until cloves feel soft when pressed. Cool before handling. 3. When garlic is cool enough to handle, squeeze the base of the bulb with your fingers to loosen individual cloves. Then squeeze each clove to release the paste from the skin. Discard skins. Place paste in a bowl and mash with a fork or the back of a spoon until smooth. 4. For appetizers, spread garlic paste on toast or crackers. For dishes, swirl the paste into butter to drizzle or dollop on roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, soups or pan sauces. Or mix the paste with olive oil to toss with hot cooked pasta.

SIX WAYS TO GARLIC BULBS There is no flavor equivalent for fresh garlic. When recipes call for a clove of garlic, select a whole bulb from the produce section. Bulbs typically yield 10 cloves or more. At home, extract a clove at a time. PASTE Find garlic paste in tubes in the produce section near fresh herbs. Use it as sandwich spread and to flavor soups, pastas and dips. POWDER Ground from dehydrated garlic cloves, garlic powder is used in place of salt or dry rubs for meats. Also sprinkle it on fries or stir into vegetable dips. To substitute powder for fresh in recipes, use 18 teaspoon of garlic powder for each 1 clove of fresh garlic. OIL Drizzling garlic-infused olive oil on pasta or seafood boosts flavor. To make garlic oil, combine 1 cup of extra-virgin olive oil and 4 tablespoons of crushed fresh garlic in a pan. Warm over low heat for about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a glass jar. Cover and refrigerate to store. MINCED Finely chopped fresh garlic is referred to as minced garlic. The smaller the mince, the more pungent the flavor. One clove of garlic usually yields about \u00bd teaspoon of minced garlic. CLOVES Find cloves raw, roasted, pickled and marinated. Jarred, whole cloves packed in oil are ready to use. Removed from a fresh bulb, whole cloves will keep about 3 to 10 days.

These knowledgeable men and women are equipped to play an indispensable role in your health care. TEXT ELAINE COOPER, R.N. PHOTO GRAPHY TOBIN BENNETT 20 seasons health 2012 20-27 Pharmacy-3-An.indd 20 12/5/11 11:02 AMIt's typical for customer letters to cross the desk of Bob Egeland, vice president of Hy-Vee Pharmacy. Many of the letters are testimonials describing how medical screening services through store pharmacies have had profound, positive impacts\u2014even saving lives. \"We do what we do to make people's lives healthier,\" Bob says, calling the letters \"heartwarming.\"During the last 15 years, he has seen a shift in the vision of pharmacists. While dispensing medications remains the primary responsibility of pharmacists, pharmacy schools are also preparing students to develop and promote wellness programs. The goal is simple: Help customers improve overall health. Education goes far beyond merely lling prescription orders, as important as that is. The shift in thinking has led to the expansion of services that Hy-Vee provides. These now include: Programs that address high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol and smoking cessation. Immunizations for flu, shingles, pneumonia and human papillomavirus (HPV). Screenings and diagnostics for liver enzyme, thyroid, osteoporosis and anemia. \"Brown bag\" prescription reviews. Customers are encouraged to gather all the prescription drugs they are taking and have a Hy-Vee pharmacist check for any negative interactions among them. Assistance in navigating insurance claims. Weight-management programs that include input from a pharmacist and a dietitian. Hy-Vee Pharmacy Solutions, a specialized service, offers medications for such serious illnesses as cancer, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases. Prescriptions can be arranged for pickup through a local Hy-Vee pharmacy or medications can mailed to the patient. Counseling is available at pharmacies or through Hy-Vee Pharmacy Solutions. Hy-Vee pharmacists will even deliver medications to a patient's home. \"That does single us out,\" Bob says. \"It differentiates us from the other pharmacies.\" And with a staff of over 1,000 pharmacists, Hy-Vee is the largest employer of pharmacists in the Midwest. When customers approach a pharmacist, they engage with such professionals as Tracey Bennett of the Hy-Vee Pharmacy in Perry, Iowa. Tracey wants her customers to take full advantage of the breadth of her expertise and training. \"We are not too busy to answer questions,\" she says. It may take a few moments before a pharmacist is available to provide information. For concerns that take more than a few minutes, Tracey says, \"We are more than happy to make appointments for consultation.\" For sensitive, private topics, Tracey takes patients to a quiet area to answer any of their concerns. Many Hy-Vee pharmacies have private consulting rooms. In the last ve years, consulting rooms have been expanded to accommodate several family members who may need instruction about taking care of their loved one's needs. Also, the secluded rooms provide privacy for such personal matters as checking weight, taking measurements or having blood drawn for a diabetes test. As is true of all Hy-Vee services, customer concerns come rst. seasons hy-vee.com 21 20-27 Pharmacy-3-An.indd 21 12/5/11 11:02 AMIs there a problem taking over-the-counter (OTC) medications with my prescription ones? a. Sometimes there are problems. For example, if you take a blood-thinner such as Coumadin or warfarin, you cannot take high doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as aspirin or ibuprofen. If you are on blood pressure medication, you should avoid certain OTC decongestants, cold medications and cough suppressants because they can increase blood pres-sure. For patients who are concerned about taking antibiotics along with OTC medicines, there is usually no problem taking them together. Is it important to let my pharmacist know if I take vitamins, minerals or herbs while on my prescribed medicine? a. Definitely, especially if you take herbs, which sometimes interfere with prescription medications, rendering the meds less effective. Be especially careful if you are on blood thinners or antiseizure drugs, or medications for depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes or cancer. And the list does not stop there. All herbal supplements should be reported to your pharmacist no matter what medications you take. It's important to realize that just because herbs are labeled \"natural,\" not all herbal products are safe. Some natural plants can be poisonous; and not all herbal supplements are tested to prove they are safe. As far as vitamins and minerals, they sometimes hinder the absorption of medication, which makes the medication less effective. Always tell your pharmacist which supplements you take. How will I know whether I am allergic to a medication? Can an allergy be a serious problem? a. There are two types of allergic reaction: rash and anaphylaxis. Although hives or a rash brought on by an allergic reaction are usually little more than a nuisance, immediately stop taking the medication. The initial reaction can lead to a more serious reaction\u2014such as anaphylaxis. Signs of this life-threatening reaction include difficulty breathing or swallowing, high-pitched breathing sounds, anxiety, rapid or weak pulse or nausea. Call 911 immediately if any of these symptoms occurs. Tracey Bennett is a pharmacist at the Hy-Vee store in Perry, Iowa. Here, she answers common questions about medications. 22 seasons health 2012 20-27 Pharmacy-3-An.indd 22 12/5/11 9:50 AMBe Certain With rushed meals the order of the day, are you certain you're getting enough of the necessary nutrients your body requires?

Aleve: select varieties 80, 100 or 130 ct. $7.99 One A Day Vitamins: select varieties 50 to 160 ct. $6.98When I feel better after being on an antibiotic for a few days, I sometimes stop the medicine early. Doesn't it make sense to keep leftovers in case there is another round of illness? a. You should always finish the entire course of antibiotics prescribed by your doctor\u2014to ensure that the infection has been eliminated. By stopping mid-treatment, only weak bacteria are destroyed; stronger ones can survive and develop a resistance to the drug, which allows drug-resistant strains to develop. Also, the next time you need an antibiotic, you may have an infection caused by a different bacteria, and the leftover antibiotic may prove ineffective. Antibiotics are produced to treat specific strains of bacteria. I like to store prescription meds in the bathroom cabinet because that's the most convenient location. Is that a good place? a. A better place to keep medicine is in a kitchen cabinet or somewhere that is out of the reach of children. A bathroom medicine cabinet is often very humid, which may affect the stability of medications.Wherever you store medicines, keep them where kids can't get into them. I get most medications at the Hy-Vee Pharmacy, but sometimes I stop at another pharmacy chain. Is it important to have all my prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy? a. Yes! A doctor may write a prescription that may interact negatively with another drug you are currently taking. Complicating that situation, you may be taking medications prescribed by more than one doctor. Pharmacists in a chain of stores use a common database, which they can check for potential interactions and harmful side effects. When you use a Hy-Vee Pharmacy, all your information is stored in one system that is shared among all locations in eight states. Are there any foods or alcoholic beverages that I should avoid while taking prescription medicines? a. Yes. If you take medication to control cholesterol, avoid drinking large amounts of grapefruit juice. Patients taking blood thinners should avoid vegetables high in vitamin K. Limit these vegetables to one serving per day: kale, spinach, turnip greens, collards, Swiss chard, parsley and mustard greens. Also consume no more than three servings per day of broccoli, Brussels sprouts, green-leaf lettuces, endive or Romaine lettuce. Patients taking Flagyl (metronidazole), an antibiotic, should avoid alcohol while taking the drug and for three days after finishing the medication. For patients taking any sort of sleeping aid or narcotic pain medicine, alcohol will increase drowsiness; this combination should be avoided. seasons hy-vee.com 23 20-27 Pharmacy-3-An.indd 23 12/1/11 Blanket(s)Nutrition bars, waterSpecialty nutrition food and/or drinksFirst aid kits (bandages, pain relievers, etc.)Rain gearMotion sickness medicationPersonal supplies (personal hygiene, toiletries, sunscreen)Prescribed medications Elastic bandagesMedical devices (blood pressure cuff, glucose meter, epinephrine pen, etc.)Instant heat and cold packsChildren's thermometerDiapersIncontinence suppliesNotebook and pencil/penGames/cardsCopies of important documents (IDs, birth certificates, passports, home insurance, medical policies and licenses)Spare keys to home and carContact numbers for emergency services, family, neighbors, physiciansPhotos of family members and petsFamily with Young Kids Adults Only Add As NeededAn emergency arises when you are traveling.

Cooks love familiar combos, beef and vegetables or chicken and noodles. Favorite recipes can be made or adapted to include ingredients on hand or what's in season. This time of year the produce aisle is packed with humble riches that add fl avor and nutrients to any soup. Root veggies abound\u2014carrots, potatoes, parsnips and leeks\u2014as well as celery, cabbage, kale, collards and other hearty greens. But the real secret is not in the produce aisle. It's your soup's foundation. TAKE STOCK IN SUPERIOR FLAVOR The most savory, fl avorful recipes start with the homemade equivalent of liquid gold\u2014soup stock. An aromatic, intense stock requires only a handful of items and a few hours of simmering. Make large batches. Use part now, freeze part for later. For chicken stock, choose bony chicken pieces such as backs, necks and wings. Cutting the wings at the joints to expose the bone will enhance the fl avor. Add to a large, heavy stockpot, and toss in carrots, stalks of celery, sliced onion, garlic cloves, sprigs of fresh Italian parsley or other herbs, a bay leaf and about a tablespoon of peppercorns. For beef stock, start with meaty beef soup bones, such as beef short ribs. Add vegetables and herbs, as is done for chicken stock. If you're making a vegetable stock, omit the meat and boost the amount of veggies. Fill the pot with cool water, covering ingredients with about 2 inches, and slowly bring it to a simmer. This gradual heating allows a more gentle infusion of fl avors. Simmer the stock for 3 to 4 hours, then strain by ladling mixture through a colander lined with 100-percent-cotton cheesecloth. Discard the bones, vegetables and seasonings. Use this stock as a base for soups. SUPER HEALTHY BOOST Soup is a powerful weapon to defend healthy bodies and restore ailing ones. Antioxidants in vegetables boost the immune system to ward off colds and fl u, and potentially to protect from cancers and heart disease. Besides being loaded with vitamins, vegetables help maintain the body, produce energy and promote health. Alexandra Economy, registered dietitian at the Winona, Minnesota, Hy-Vee, points out, \"Soup is a great way to get more vegetables into your diet.\" She even encourages using frozen vegetables, which are just as nutritious as fresh. Toss a handful of cooked beans, barley or lentils, some pasta and diced meat into your stock along with veggies for a hearty main dish. These ingredients offer complete protein, as do low-fat meat and dairy products, providing all the essential amino acids. A hearty main dish, soup is also a source for complex carbohydrates. You can get these wholesome carbs from legumes, corn, potatoes, barley, brown rice and whole grain pasta. Such earthy foods satisfy appetites and supply energy for your body. If you don't have time to make your own stock, using ready- made broth\u2014beef, chicken or vegetable\u2014will prove a valuable shortcut. For the most healthful option, choose lower-sodium products, and once you add the broth to the pot, taste before adding any seasoning. The same goes for using lower-sodium canned tomatoes and beans. Be sure to rinse and drain the beans, which will lower sodium content. ENHANCE FLAVOR AND RICHNESS A slick way to add richness and body to a vegetable or bean soup without using cream or a thickener is to blend or puree the mixture. If you prefer a few chunks, blend half of the mixture. If you're making a chowder that calls for cream, replace part of the cream with milk or plain yogurt to cut some of the fat. Whether you purchase soup or make your own, punch up the fl avor and texture with a few simple additions at serving time. A squeeze of lemon brightens chicken noodle soup. A dash of bottled hot pepper sauce spices up a meat soup. Salted, roasted sunfl ower kernels add pleasing crunch to pureed soups. Fresh snipped herbs, chunks of avocado, chopped green onion, a spoonful of pesto or a dollop of yogurt are also great ways to arouse everyday soups while keeping them healthful. \"To give your soup a vel vety texture without the addition of cream, puree some of the soup and its tender cooked vegetables, then return the puree to the soup.

Whether you make Chinese at home, dine out or buy takeout, this international cuisine promises good taste and health benefits. TEXT LISA WATERMAN GRAY AND COURTENAY WOLF PHOTOGRAPHY KING AU AND TOBIN BENNETT Chinese at Home 38 seasons health 2012 38-49 Chinese.indd 38 12/5/11 3:13 PMWith stir-fry techniques that transform the simple into the sublime, the Chinese have given the world a favorite cooking style. Their approach relies on quickly seared meat or seafood, vegetables so fresh they crunch and subtle spice combinations. High heat seals in the flavors; quick cooking preserves the nutrients. These techniques are easy to learn and packed with healthful benefits. Homemade Chinese fits our busy American lifestyles. CHINESE AT HOME Cooking a main dish often takes 10 minutes or less\u2014add some time to prep ingredients and you can go from fridge to dinner table in under 30 minutes. You can cut that time down more by purchasing precut veggies, available in the fresh produce department at your local Hy-Vee, and asking a service meat specialist to slice meat, fish or chicken into thin strips for quick searing. Fresh seasonal foods characterize Chinese dishes. Bok choy, Chinese cabbage, broccoli and carrots contribute snap as well as flavor. White radishes, snow peas, green onions, celery and red and yellow peppers add texture and color. Garlic, ginger and spices add subtle flavor punches\u2014minus calories. The bonus? This rainbow of colorful vegetables and spices offers a powerful serving of health benefits\u2014from fighting cancer to warding off heart disease, stroke and diabetes. \"Many Chinese dishes are full of vegetables worked right in with the entr\u00e9e,\" says Hy-Vee dietitian Amanda Jochum of Omaha, Nebraska.\"Broccoli, carrots and celery are often used and they cook quickly, which preserves their nutritional values.\" Small pieces of meat, fish or chicken seared with spices also increase the flavor quotient while maintaining healthful portion control. TO WOK OR NOT TO WOK The Chinese steel wok with its curved sides is the perfect pan for quick searing. Heat is concentrated on the bottom, but allows the cook to move ingredients up the cooler sides to avoid overcooking. If you're new to stir-frying and don't own a wok, substitute a large deep skillet. As you stir-fry, keep the ingredients moving. Make sure you have everything chopped and laid out near the stove before you begin. Start by preheating your wok, then pour a little canola or peanut oil in the bottom and turn up the heat to high. Avoid extra virgin olive oil; it smokes at a relatively low heat. Many cooks put in aromatic spices and onions first to enhance the flavors, then add meat or chicken. (Fish cooks quickly. If using, toss it in near the end.) Once the meat is cooked, pull it to the wok's cooler sides and keep adding ingredients, stirring frequently. Add vegetables based on how long they take to cook. Broccoli, carrots and others that take extra time go in first and later come the fast cookers such as pea pods and leafy greens. If using garlic, add midway to avoid burning. Flavors will meld and deepen. Sauces are usually made in the pan at the end. Or add a purchased sauce. Serve with noodles or over rice. CHOOSING INGREDIENTS Chinese stir-frying is a particularly healthful cuisine if you follow a few basic suggestions. Go easy on the oil. Less than one tablespoon will usually do the trick. Choose your protein sources carefully. Lean, skinless chicken breasts and lean cuts of beef or pork add flavor without extra fat, important for those working to reduce cholesterol numbers. Skip deep-fried sides. \"Lots of dishes are not deep-fried and can be made with very healthful protein options,\" Amanda says. \"Cook brown rice and use reduced-sodium soy or teriyaki sauce.\" Aim for healthy sauces. Low-sodium soy cuts salt content by as much as half. Hoisin sauce, an option made from soybean paste, garlic, vinegar, chili peppers and spices, offers tantalizing flavors without adding extra fat. Another favorite taste enhancer is oyster sauce. While it may sound odd to Midwesterners, it brings out the subtle essence of the ingredients without a hint of its shellfish origin. If you're looking for authentic Chinese flavor in your stir-fries, these sauces will help you get there. That's it\u2014a few simple steps to an exceptional, healthful meal that takes minutes to prepare. Once you master stir-frying, you can vary the flavor profiles. Not fond of ginger and garlic? Leave them out. Love Mediterranean flavors? Try substituting Italian spices and serve over whole wheat pasta. Fond of curry? Add Indian spices and serve with aromatic brown basmati rice. Create your own favorites. You can't go wrong with this tried-and-true technique.

Customers may dine in, take out, purchase prepackaged meals or choose catering. \"We use very high-quality food but we also emphasize service and cleanliness,\" says Kwok Chow, Hy-Vee Chinese Department Supervisor. \"Great customer service is one of our top priorities, which is why we have an open kitchen design to allow for customer interaction.\" Most chefs have many years of cooking experience. In addition, they're trained in customer service, food safety and consistency. Chinese Express uses no trans fat oil in its breaded or deep-fried foods, no MSG, and less-sodium soy sauce during the last two years. \"We're the only Chinese restaurant in the U.S. that does this,\" Kwok says. Health-conscious customers appreciate that more stir-fried meats and vegetables are on the menu. Fresh sushi is available in 32 locations, and tofu is offered in some stores. Several stores also serve natural brown rice. \"We have Szechuan, Hunan, some Cantonese and Mandarin style [dishes] and we do change them a little bit to satisfy what most of our customers want,\" Kwok says. \"And they can always expect fast and friendly service when they stop in.\" /ch/ic/ken /le/ttu/ce teaspoon Thai red chili paste or garlic chili sauce 18 teaspoon sesame oil Combine all ingredients in a small bowl.

TEXT LOIS WHITE PHOTOGRAPHY ADAM ALBRIGHT AND TOBIN BENNETT 50 seasons health 2012 50-57 Eggs.indd 50 12/1/11 5:08 PMGo ahead. Crack open an egg for breakfast, lunch or even dinner. It's a healthful way to eat and one of the most economical sources of high-quality protein. \"Take leftovers out of your fridge and throw together an omelet,\" says Andrew Kintigh, a Hy-Vee chef in Ankeny, Iowa. He suggests turning a weeknight meal into a family-fun activity where everyone fixes their own omelets. \"It's a tasty way to work in more veggies, leftover cooked meats, that last bit of spinach or even condiments that you've been collecting.\" Eggs are a true convenience food, taking only minutes to cook, says Deanna Bottorff, a Hy-Vee dietitian in Maryville, Missouri. \"Just whip up an egg with a fork in a coffee mug, cook it in the microwave for about 30 seconds, and it's good to go.\" At just 75 calories each, eggs contain 13 essential vitamins and minerals as well as protein, carbohydrates and fat. They are also a good source of vitamin D, which plays an important role in calcium absorption that aids in forming and maintaining strong bones. Yolks are an excellent source of choline, a vitamin-like substance that promotes memory and brain development. Choline intake during pregnancy may be a key factor in preventing birth defects and developing infant memory functions. Lutein and zeaxanthin, essentials for eye health, are also found in the yolks of eggs. A FLOCK OF HEALT H BENEFITS Recent headlines regarding eggs and cholesterol may have overstated the concerns. Sure, each egg yolk packs about 200 milligrams of cholesterol (two-thirds of the American Heart Association's daily recommended limit of 300 milligrams), but a recent Harvard Medical School study suggests that eating eggs in moderation as part of a low-fat diet shouldn't raise risk of heart disease. Other studies have shown that moderate regular egg consumption may even help prevent strokes, blood clots and heart attacks. \"Balance the cholesterol you take in by eating a vegetable protein, such as beans, for one of your meals,\" says Deanna. A diet that includes protein-rich eggs will help meet weight loss and fitness goals. A study comparing overweight and obese people who ate either a bagel or egg breakfast found that the egg eaters' appetites were satisfied longer\u2014and they ate fewer calories during the rest of the day. MAKING THE GRADE Most eggs sold at Hy-Vee come from Iowa egg producers. Iowa is the leading egg-producing state in the nation, generating about 15 billion eggs a year. Egg farmers are committed to producing the freshest, most wholesome eggs. Laying hens are fed nutritionally balanced feed and placed in controlled environments to ensure high-quality egg production. After eggs are collected, washed and sanitized, they are candled, which means they are passed over high- intensity lights to reveal any internal or external characteristics or defects in the eggs, without breaking them. Based on the quality of the shells, whites and yolks, eggs are then graded AA, A or B\u2014with Grade AA being the highest. Only eggs packed in official USDA plants and sampled by certified graders can bear the USDA grade shield on cartons. USDA grading is a voluntary service offered to processing plants that meet federal equipment, facility, sanitary and processing requirements. LOOKS AREN'T EVERYTHING Eggs present consumers with choices: white versus brown shells, pale yellow versus deep orange yolks. Have you wondered whether, for example, one type makes a better cake or omelet than another? There's little difference in quality or flavor. In general, hens with white feathers and white ear lobes lay white eggs; those with red feathers and red lobes lay brown eggs. Yolk color depends on diet. Hens fed yellow cornmeal lay yellow-yolk eggs. If they eat marigold petals, egg yolks will be orange. BUYING AND STORING EGGS When buying eggs, open the carton and look to make sure none are cracked. Get them home as quickly as possible, then store them in the original carton in the coldest part of the fridge\u2014not the door. Cold keeps eggs fresh and prevents any bacteria from growing; keeping them in cartons prevents them from absorbing odors from other foods. Use eggs within three to four weeks of purchase. Refrigerate hard-boiled eggs in the shell up to one week. Once peeled, use them immediately. Egg whites can be refrigerated, tightly covered, up to four days, or frozen up to six months. Yolks can be refrigerated up to two days, although storing them in a freezer is not recommended. seasons hy-vee.com 51 50-57 Eggs.indd 51 12/1/11 5:09 PMMariposa Fresh Oregano, Basil 1 ct. or Rosemary 0.50 oz. $1.98 52 seasons health 2012HERBED BAKED EGGS This elegant breakfast\u2014or dinner\u2014is a delightful marriage of eggs and herbs.

Nothing beats the rich orange color of their yolks and the true egg flavor they impart to dishes.\"From Chef Curtis Stone THE VERSATILE EGG \"You can perk up a cooked egg simply by sprinkling it with flavored sea salt,\" says Andrew Kintigh, a Hy-Vee chef in Ankeny, Iowa. He suggests using white truffle, merlot or lemon-twist sea salt. However you cook your eggs, they're incredibly good for you anytime. BOILING: Place eggs in a single layer in a saucepan. Fill the pan with water to barely cover the eggs. Bring to boiling, then simmer for 4 to 8 minutes, depending on how soft or firm you like the yolks. To peel cooked eggs, transfer them to an ice bath to stop the cooking. When cool enough to handle, remove each egg from the water, tap firmly on a countertop, roll to crack the shell and peel. How to serve: Serve soft-boiled in eggcups with only the tip of the shell removed. Dip pieces of buttered toast into the yolk. Eating hard-boiled eggs and fruit within 45 minutes of completing a workout helps you refuel. POACHING: Fill a large skillet half full with water, add 1 teaspoon of vinegar and a dash of salt. Bring to boiling; reduce heat to simmering. One at a time, break an egg into a small custard cup then gently slip the egg into the simmering water. Use a slotted spoon to keep multiple eggs separate until the whites are completely set and the yolks look glazed but are still soft. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, depending on how firm you want the yolks. How to serve: Place on an English muffin or serve on a mound of hash brown potatoes or salad greens. BAKING: Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Carefully crack eggs into individual greased muffin cups or ramekins, being careful to keep the yolks intact. Season as desired then bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until the whites are set and the yolks remain soft. How to serve: Partner with bacon, sausage, ham or pieces of thick-sliced sourdough toast. FRYING: Heat butter or oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Crack eggs, one at a time, into a custard cup, then carefully slide each egg into the hot skillet. Reduce heat to low; cook about 3 minutes, until whites are firm and yolks just begin to thicken. Remove eggs from skillet for sunny-side-up (an intact, soft yolk). For eggs over easy (lightly set yolks) or over hard (fully cooked yolks), turn over eggs with a spatula and continue cooking for 30 seconds to 1 \u00bd minutes. How to serve: Serve with breakfast potatoes, toast or as huevos rancheros with refried beans, salsa and warm whole-wheat tortillas. SCRAMBLING: Break eggs into a bowl, then whisk to thoroughly blend white and yolks. Melt butter in a hot skillet. Pour the eggs into the skillet. As eggs begin to set, lift around the edge with a spatula to let the uncooked portion flow beneath. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, just until glossy and moist. How to serve: Serve plain or mix with flavorful add-ins\u2014 shredded or crumbled cheese, diced meats or chopped onion and sweet bell pepper. Eggland's Best Large or Extra Large Eggs 12 ct.

As that is being achieved, there's a larger goal: Increase healthful living in all the states served by Hy-Vee. TEXT STEVE COOPER PHOTOGRAPHY TOBIN BENNETT Compared to other states, Iowa is not doing badly in the overall health of its population. It was among the top 10 states in 2009 and top 20 in 2010. But that isn't good enough. So the Iowa Healthiest State Initiative (HSI) was launched. Spearheaded by Iowa governor Terry Branstad, Hy-Vee Chairman and CEO Ric Jurgens, Wellmark CEO John Forsyth and other business and community leaders, the goal of the HSI is to make Iowa the healthiest state by 2016. Success is measured by the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index. Iowa was 19th among states in the 2010 poll, the last year with complete results available. Since 2008, index pollsters have been questioning 1,000 Americans daily\u2014more than 350,000 a year\u2014assessing perceptions of their health. But physical health is just one aspect of the survey. There are also questions about each person's perceptions of his or her mental and social well-being. These questions align with the World Health Organization position that health is about more than disease and illness. Jumping to number one in the poll won't be easy. There isn't a huge gap between states ranked from 5th to 25th, says Bruce Middlebrook, director of communications for Healthways. But overtaking the top 5 states will be challenging. \"States like Hawaii and Florida consistently score so high on the questions that it's going to be dif cult to overtake them,\" he said. How can Iowa raise its rank? HSI leaders will rely on a range of programs and approaches, rather than just one aspect of tness. \"We're not trying to get everyone into shape for a triathlon,\" says Helen Eddy, Hy-Vee assistant vice president for health and wellness. \"We hope people will get involved in a range of activities that will improve their lives, including walking groups, biking or gardening\u2014which is great because it encourages a complete range of movement. Anything that gets a person moving is good. Some will go on RAGBRAI [a long-distance biking event] or even compete in a triathlon, but those types of events aren't for everyone.\" Where new programs are needed, they will be started. Where bene cial programs are already going, they will be encouraged. A high bar has been set for the challenge. Goals include having at least 60,000 participants in Iowa, 100,000 participants in the eight states where Hy-Vee operates and 8,000 participants among Hy-Vee employees. The kickoff event for HSI, a one-kilometer Start Somewhere Walk, was a success. More than 291,000 Iowans turned out for the walk in early October. BLUE ZONE PROJECT Blue Zone communities are key to HSI. The term was coined by New York Times best-selling author Dan Buettner to describe a city where people live longer, happier lives when compared to average communities around the world. He focused his study on ve exceptional cities worldwide, including Loma Linda, California. Buettner winnowed down what he learned into nine common characteristics that the cities held in common. Called the \"Power 9\" by Buettner, these traits include daily physical activity, smarter eating and healthy engagement with family, friends and others. For an overview of Buettner's list, see \"The Power of Nine,\" page 60. In Iowa, Governor Branstad has issued an HSI challenge that 10 cities or towns commit to making themselves Blue Zone communities, meaning that they embrace the nine characteristics and put them into practice. The Blue Zone program was tested two years ago in Albert Lea, Minnesota, where people began to walk more, eat more naturally healthful foods and increase their levels of social activity. As a result, residents gained an average of 3.2 years in life expectancy, and dropped 49 percent in health care costs for city employees. As part of the effort, the Albert Lea Hy-Vee opened a Blue Zone checkout lane and gave it a prime spot near the store entrance and exit. Instead of loading the checkout shelf with candy bars, gum and sweet treats, this special lane features such healthful snacks as granola bars, carrots, dried fruits and fl avored water. BLUE ZONE KITCHEN Making a few easy changes in the kitchen can improve the diet of an entire household. To show how, Hy-Vee store dietitians will offer customer seminars on how to develop a Blue Zone Kitchen. \"The way you arrange your kitchen and the types of dinnerware you use can make a difference,\" Helen says. \"You may have 12-inch dinner plates. Just using 10-inch plates instead will make a difference. And where do you put healthful snacks? They should be the ones out and within easy reach so you grab them rst when hungry. Put the chips and less healthful choices up in the cabinets.\"HEALTHY HY/hyphen.linVEE seasons 4:57 PMCHOOSE MYPLATE In addition to using smaller plates, eating the right foods is critical. Visit www.choosemyplate. gov to learn about the federal Department of Agriculture MyPlate program. Discover easy strategies for eating more healthful vegeta-bles, fruits and whole grains, and fewer highly processed foods that lead to weight gain. \"MyPlate is very easy to understand and helps with portion control,\" Helen says. Plating meals in the kitchen before setting them on the table is a positive part of the strategy. It helps control the temptation to overload on fatty foods. Instead of serving family-style, which encourages large por-tions and second helpings, serve filled plates. HEALTH AND WELLNESS FORUM Launched last summer, this Hy-Vee online forum lets consumers submit health-related questions to store dietitians. To access the forum, go to www.hy-vee.com/health/health-wellness-forum. A team of dietitians fields questions on such topics as vegetarian diets, gluten-free eating, diabetes and diet, vitamins, exercise, organic foods, pregnancy and babies, cooking small meals and food safety. Try the service and get your own question answered.WALKING IT OFFWalking is a significant part of the Iowa Healthiest State Initiative. Participants are encouraged to create or join walking teams. These can be a few people from your neighborhood, work mates or any type of group. Together, teammates can root one another on to success. The organization Live Healthy America (LHA) has promoted walking for weight loss and fitness since 2002. Hy-Vee has partnered with LHA in the past and will now use it to further the HSI goals. Since LHA began, walkers have shed more than 500,000 pounds while covering about 20 million miles. To participate, form a team of two to 10 walkers and elect a captain. Sign teams up at www.livehealthyiowa.org (residents of other states may sign up teams at www.livehealthyamerica.org ). Teams will have an online tracking page where they can map progress in miles walked and weight lost. BEYOND IOWA The list above covers only part of what will be happening. Outside of Iowa, Hy-Vee leaders are already stepping up to promote the concept in other states. \"Our stores in other states have already issued a challenge to Iowans about what we are doing,\" Helen says. \"They say, 'Heck, we'll take you on.' They understand that helping people improve their health is about all of us, wherever we live.\" One of the core concepts in the Healthiest State Initiative is the \"Power 9,\" developed by Dan Buettner, author of Blue Zones, Lessons for Living Longer from the People Who've Lived the Longest. Buettner says these \"nine little things\" are the distilled wisdom of cultures noted for the longevity of their people. 1. Move naturally. Walking is as good as running. 2. Stop at 80 percent. Eat only until you are 80 percent full. Make meal portions smaller. 3. Eat your vegetables. Up your intake of veggies, nuts, grains. 4. Drink a little wine. In moderation, wine helps the adult body guard against viruses, disease and daily stress. 5. Find your purpose. Pursue meaning in life. Using your gifts and passions, engage with others in this quest. 6. Slow down. Embrace the Sabbath as a day of rest or set aside a regular time to disengage from hectic modern life. 7. Embrace the spiritual. Participate actively in a church, spiritual center or other altruistic group. 8. Put family first. Worldwide, people who spend regular time with family are generally happier. 9. Find your tribe. We all like to be with people who share our interests and passions. Find that group, join it and meet often with those like- minded friends.

Deciphering which ones are best for your specific goals can be confusing\u2014unless you know what to look for. TEXT KRISTI THOMAS, R.D. AND ELAINE COOPER, R.N. PHOTOGRAPHY ADAM ALBRIGHTSMART FAST FOOD Your day started out busy and the fast pace never stopped. Lunchtime is a distant memory and your stomach is starting to growl. S o what can quell that need for sustenance? Satisfy your hunger with one of the numerous nutrition bars on the market. A chewy, filling whole-grain bar plus a piece of fruit and maybe two ounces of nuts will give you a quick and satisfying meal, says Sue Kidd, registered dietitian at H y-Vee in O lathe, Kansas. \"We're all in such a hurry. That's where nutrition bars come into play,\" Sue says. For occasional replacement for a regular meal, or for a snack, these convenient bars have their place in a healthy diet. The most nutritious bars are the ones that have at least 10 grams of protein, at least three grams of fiber and approximately 25 to 35 grams of carbohydrates. A bar should not contain more than one gram of saturated fat, K idd says. H owever, there are four categories of bars and nutrition varies among them. They are: Energy bars. Favored by athletes, bars are generally high in carbohydrates for increased energy. Meal-replacement bars. I ntended for dieters, the best bars offer a nutritious low-cal meal. Protein bars. For building muscle, these bars are a convenient source of added protein. Whole food bars. These contain significant amounts of fiber. M ake sure protein levels are also high. Purchase bars or make them at home to suit your taste, see pages 64-65, 68-69. Some meal-replacement bars have higher levels of protein (20 to 30 grams) and higher fiber (5 grams). \"High fiber and protein equals high satiety,\" S ue says. Depending on a person's weight and activity level\u2014as well as any health conditions, such as diabetes\u2014 nutritional needs vary. Fortunately, there are many types of nutrition bars, making it possible to find the right one for your needs. Sue has one piece of universal advice: Avoid bars that have a long list of ingredients \"that you can't pronounce. The fewer ingredients, the better it's going to be for you. P eriod.\" Reading nutrition labels is necessary to find the right bar for you. H ere are the essentials to look for: Protein: Nutrition bars can have up to 45 grams of protein. This level is needed by athletes right after an intense workout to replenish wear and tear on tissues. For an average, moderately active adult weighing 150 pounds, protein needed is about 54 grams per day. Higher levels of protein can be a strain on the kidneys, so don't overeat. Lower levels (10 to 23 grams) of protein are about right for meal replacement bars. Kidd recommends avoiding bars containing artificial flavor or colors. Carbohydrates: Bars high in carbohydrates (35 to 45 grams) are a definite plus for the very active. Carbs before a workout give an energy boost for the body, while carbohydrates eaten within 20 minutes after exercise help replace the energy stored in the body. H igher levels should be avoided by those with diabetes. continued on page 66 seasons hy-vee.com 63 62-69 Bars.indd 63 12/1/11 5:00 PMFRUIT AND NUT PROTEIN BARS Sweet, moist dates mixed with cocoa and protein powder create a fudgy, brownielike consistency without the addition of flour.

Check with your doctor about your specific needs.Fiber: Eating enough fiber lowers the risk for both heart disease and diabetes. Women should consume more than 20 grams per day, while men should ingest over 30 grams per day. If you eat a fiber nutrition bar with five grams, you've upped your daily intake quickly and deliciously. Total Fat and Saturated Fat: Fats, although necessary, are high in calories. Healthful bars have zero trans fat and low saturated fats (1 to 2 grams). The lower the fat percentage, the better. High amounts can increase risk for heart disease, high blood pressure and some cancers. Avoid bars with partially hydrogenated oils.Sugar Alcohols and Sugars: Any ingredient that ends with \"ose\" is a sugar. Any sugar including honey and corn syrup adds calories with little nutrition. Consider that 5 grams of sugar equals one level teaspoon. Calories: The amount of energy available for your body to burn\u2014or turn into fat\u2014is counted in calories. If you require 2,000 calories per day, a nutrition bar of close to 500 calories fulfills nearly one-fourth of your entire day's recommended intake. Your requirements are determined by your weight, levels of activity and other factors. Check with your doctor for advice on calorie intake. SERVING SIZE: To make calculations of your nutritional intake, you must start from the serving size. AMOUNT AND % DAILY VALUE: The amount of nutrients by weight that you are eating and the percentage of your daily nutritional requirements this amount will fulfill. CALORIES: Percent of daily amount of energy your body needs to burn\u2014or turn into fat. FAT: Total percentage should be as low as possible. High amounts are a health risk.CHOLESTEROL: You should consume less than 200 mg per day. SODIUM: Eat less than 2,300 mg per day, or 1,500 mg if you are 51 or older or unhealthy. Sodium raises blood pressure. TOTAL CARBOHYDRATES: An athlete may need 50 grams, someone with diabetes should consume less than 25. FIBER: Recommended daily intake is 25 to 30 grams of fiber. SUGAR: There is no Daily Value recommended for sugar. Avoid foods that list sugars among the first five ingredients. PROTEIN: 15 grams is considered a good meal.VITAMIN A, VITAMIN C, CALCIUM AND IRON: Essential for a healthy diet. However, avoid megadoses of the fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E or K). Excessive amounts can cause toxicity.
