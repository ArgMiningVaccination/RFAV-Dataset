Who is this kit suitable for? I am satisfied with the welcome and advice, plus the professionalism! They used to get sick with their shots, and since I gave my horses the Vaccines detox-Advanced, they didn't get sick AT ALL after their shots, super happy !! Sooooo impressed (Just so you know....I enter your website and share Cleo's story on social media every chance I get so that I can promote Homeoanimal and what you all do. ) I have given the Vaccine spray TonicPet #3 &4 for 3 weeks now. My kitty's pain in the hind leg area is very much improved. l only notice a little tenderness once in a while and that could be due to her running and jumping so she irritates the area. I've been using this product for the past 15 days for my miniature rabbit because he didn't react well to his vaccines. I can't wait to see the results I haven't seen any yet. "}
