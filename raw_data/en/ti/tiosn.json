If this is difficult for you will be relying heavily on the visual component of balance which works hand in hand with both the vestibular (inner ear) and proprioceptive (awareness of body position) systems to keep you upright. It's a good idea to have all three working well especially as functionality declines with age. With regards to the proprioceptive element, think about your feet being packed with sensory neurons and receptors that send messages to your brain about the nature of what you are standing on and how well balanced you are. Wearing shoes with big squashy soles can supress this feedback! Therefore aim to go barefoot around the house and try the following three exercises on a regular basis; - Roll a tennis ball under the sole of your foot - Make circles both ways and then a figure of 8 with your toes so that you are rotating your ankles and - Pick up a handkerchief or something similar with your toes. Meditation - where to start? Meditation practice requires little resources and can be done just about anywhere. All it takes is the time to do it - as little as 5 minutes a day to start with. However many people think there is a 'right' way to meditate and don't know where to start. It is really very simple; - Find a quiet, comfortable space to practice where you won't be disturbed and remember to - Breathe naturally and easily. - If thoughts arise, which will inevitably happen, try not to judge them, but rather refocus your attention back to your breathing. Tip: By the way, it is impossible not to have thoughts! Just acknowledge them and return to your breathing as many times as it takes. "}
