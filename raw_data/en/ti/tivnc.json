The portal allows you to obtain a record of the COVID-19 vaccinations you have received in Virginia. This may be useful if you have misplaced the vaccine card you received at a vaccination clinic; if your first, second, third and booster doses were written on different cards; or if you would like to give a copy of your record to someone else. The request portal will provide you a copy of your COVID-19 vaccination record that can be stored on your mobile device for proof of vaccination as well. - What is a COVID-19 Vaccination Record with a QR Code? The COVID-19 Vaccination Record with QR Code is an electronic vaccination record drawn from the data stored in the Virginia Immunization Information System (VIIS). The record also includes a QR code (a type of square barcode) that, when scanned by a tablet or smartphone with the [SMART Health Verifier App](https://thecommonsproject.org/smart-health-card-verifier), will display to the reader your name, date of birth, vaccine date(s), and vaccine type. The Vaccination Record with QR Code is an alternative to a paper vaccine card and also confirms the vaccine record as an official record of the Virginia Department of Health. - What information is in my COVID-19 Vaccination Record with QR Code? The vaccination record provided by the portal includes your name, date of birth, date of each COVID-19 vaccination you received; the manufacturer, description, and lot number; and the provider who administered it. No other personal information is returned. Because the Vaccination Record with QR Code is digitally signed by the Virginia Department of Health, it cannot be altered or forged. - What if my COVID-19 Vaccination Record with QR Code is incorrect? If the information on a digital vaccine record is incorrect (e.g., missing dose, wrong date(s) or incorrect brand), you may need to correct or update your immunization record. You can contact your provider to update your record or call 877-VAX-IN-VA (877-829-4682) for help. Assistance is available Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET. - Which vaccinations are included in my COVID-19 Vaccination Record with QR Code? The vaccination record provided by the portal includes only COVID-19 vaccinations entered in the Virginia Immunization Information System (VIIS) by providers, and may not include vaccinations administered outside Virginia or by federal government agencies such as the Department of Defense or the Department of Veterans Affairs. - What if I get a new dose, will it show on the COVID-19 Vaccination Record with QR Code? The COVID-19 Vaccination Record with QR Code does not automatically update. If you receive an additional dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, you will have to get a new Vaccination Record with QR Code through the [COVID-19 Vaccination Record Request Portal](https://vase.vdh.virginia.gov/vacapps/f?p=545:1). - Am I required to show my vaccination record to anyone? Individual businesses, employers, and other organizations are usually not prohibited from requiring vaccination or proof of vaccination for employees, customers, and/or other participants if they choose to do so. - How do I access my record? Is my information secure? To access your COVID-19 Vaccination Record, visit [vaccinate.virginia.gov](https://vaccinate.virginia.gov/) and click \"Need a copy of your vaccination record?\" Enter your name, date of birth, and ZIP code. If there is a match, the system will send a verification code to the phone number associated with your vaccination record, through either a text message or an automated voice call. This prevents other people from accessing your record. When the two-factor authentication is verified, you can view, save, and print your COVID-19 Vaccination Record with QR Code. With iOS 15, you can securely store verifiable versions of your COVID-19 test results and immunization records in the Health app on your iPhone or iPod Touch. The QR code is a secure copy of your vaccination record. To protect privacy, the QR code itself can only be scanned and read by a SMART Health-compliant device. - Is this system intended to be a vaccine passport? No. Constituents are not required to obtain a COVID-19 Vaccination Record with QR Code. It is an optional means to obtain COVID-19 vaccine information, and is the digital version of the paper CDC vaccine card. It is one of the options to show proof of vaccination. - How can I obtain assistance with the COVID-19 Vaccination Record Request Portal, or records of vaccinations for other than COVID-19? If you cannot locate your COVID-19 Vaccination Record through the portal, please call 877-VAX-IN-VA (877-829-4682), Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET.

Vaccine providers in Virginia submit vaccination records to the Virginia Immunization Information System (VIIS), but they may have provided information that's incomplete, out of date, or incorrect. So, it's likely we have your record, but not the correct information. For instance: - Mobile phone number does not match - Name is spelled differently - Address is out of date or incorrect To find the record, you should try re-entering their information without a ZIP code. If your record still isn't found, you can contact your provider to update your vaccination record or call 877-VAX-IN-VA (877-829-4682) for help. Assistance is available Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET. Some doses administered outside Virginia to Virginia residents may be in VIIS. Doses administered directly by federal agencies such as the Department of Defense or Department of Veterans Affairs are not reported to VIIS. - How do I test the COVID-19 Vaccination Record with QR Code on my own? The Smart Health Verifier App may be used by businesses to verify an individual's COVID-19 Vaccination Record with QR Code. Individuals do not need to test their own Vaccination Record with QR Code with the Smart Health Verifier App. If an individual would like to test their COVID-19 Vaccination Record with QR Code using the Smart Health Verifier App on their smartphone, it is recommended the individual print the record from a computer or smartphone prior to scanning it with the Verifier App because it is likely that the computer screen resolution of the individual may not allow the QR code to be read by the Verifier App. Also, the Verifier App does not allow the COVID-19 Vaccination Record with QR Code to be uploaded. The Verifier App is only for verification purposes. Please call 877-VAX-IN-VA (877-829-4682), Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET with any additional questions. "}
