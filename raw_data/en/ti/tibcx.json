Conducted at College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210 Summary MCS, [MA-631](https://www.mapi.com/products/rejuvenation-for-men), M-4, and M-5 have been shown to inhibit in-vitro human LDL oxidation. In the present study, the effects of [MA-631](https://www.mapi.com/products/rejuvenation-for-men), [SR](https://www.mapi.com/products/intelligence-plus), [LR](https://www.mapi.com/products/rejuvenation-for-ladies) and MCS on microsomal lipid peroxidation were examined in vitro. Rat liver microsomes were incubated with a sodium ascorbate and ADP-iron complex or with an NADPH generating system to stimulate non-enzymatic or enzymatic lipid peroxidation respectively. Aqueous or alcoholic extracts of [MA-631](https://www.mapi.com/products/rejuvenation-for-men), [SR](https://www.mapi.com/products/intelligence-plus), [LR](https://www.mapi.com/products/rejuvenation-for-ladies) and MCS, when added to these incubation systems, inhibited hepatic microsomal lipid peroxidation in a dose dependent manner. The alcoholic extracts were the most effective antiperoxidants in both systems. Alcoholic extract of MCS-inhibited ascorbate or NADPH-induced lipid peroxidation by 56% and 63% with 12 ugm and 22.5 ugm, respectively. These findings suggest that these Maharishi Ayurveda food supplements may be useful in the treatment of free radical induced injury due to their antiperoxidant properties.
