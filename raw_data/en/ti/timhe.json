I grew up in a culture that heavily believes in astrology and ayrvedha (a form of holistic medicine that's focused on promoting a balanced body and mind) - despite the close association and familiarity, I've always been somewhat of a skeptic about alternative medicine and crystal healing. My fascination with gemstones is attributed to their beauty and the unique journey of how they come to be, i.e. from beneath the earth, to being mined, then fashioned on to a piece of jewelry - this process in its self is pretty magical I think. But historical records throughout millennia points to the fact that people have always believed in metaphysical properties of gem crystals, and may have adorned them for more that just their beauty. It is believed, the ancient Egyptians used stones such as [lapis lazuli](https://www.crystalage.com/online_store/stone_type/lapis_lazuli.cfm), [turquoise](https://www.crystalage.com/online_store/stone_type/turquoise.cfm), [carnelian](https://www.crystalage.com/online_store/stone_type/carnelian.cfm), [emerald](https://www.crystalage.com/search/index.cfm?sSearchString=emerald) and [clear quartz](https://www.crystalage.com/online_store/stone_type/quartz.cfm) in their jewelry for protection, good health and fortune. They also carved grave amulets from the same gems for their burial tombs. Ancient Greeks attributed a number of healing properties to crystals and many of the names we use for gemstones today are of Greek origin. For instance, the word 'crystal' comes from the Greek word for ice, as it was believed that clear quartz was water that had frozen so deeply that it would always remain solid. In Greek mythology, a titan named Rhea gave the god of wine, Dionysus, an amethyst to help preserve his sanity. In fact, this myth led the ancient Romans to believe that amethysts could keep them from getting drunk. [Jade](https://www.crystalage.com/online_store/stone_type/jade.cfm) was (and is still today) highly valued in ancient China and some Chinese emperors are said to have been buried in jade armor. Jade is recognized as a kidney [healing stone](https://www.crystalage.com/online_store/healing_stones_908.cfm) both in China and South America. Chinese parents often give a jade bracelet as a gift to their daughters as a symbol of their love and protection. The South Asian subcontinent has been one of the major centers of colored gemstone trade over the past several millennia. Out of all the types of gems that are held in reverence in the subcontinent, Navaratna probably features in the top due to the mystical powers believed to be possessed by this combination of stones. The term \"Navaratna\" is derived from the Sanskrit word meaning \"nine gems.\" Diamond, ruby, emerald, coral, pearl, yellow sapphire, blue sapphire, hessonite garnet and cat's eye. Each of these gems are assigned a certain celestial significance and has been popular since ancient times due to the supernatural prowess ascribed to this nine gem combination. Even today, navaratna gems are used to prevent and cure illness and other evils in South Asian cultures. In fact, one of my wedding gifts from a family relative was a set of navaratna gems. With the New Age movement of the 1980s, popularity of healing crystals resurfaced in western cultures. And it's fair to say that today, healing crystals have crossed the boundaries of religious and spiritual beliefs - it's no longer viewed in the domain of alternative culture, it's more acceptable and more mainstream. Healing crystals are literally everywhere at the moment, I follow several very successful shops on instagram, Carol Woolton just released a book about living with crystals, rose quartz face rollers are the 'must have' beauty tool according to my girlfriends and just in general, more people ask me about healing crystals and metaphysical properties of gemstones to aid in their decision for buying a piece of jewelry. Metaphysical properties of minerals is not a topic widely discussed in Gemology. But what we do learn in gemology is the fact that energy resides in each gemstone and transmits energy at particular wavelengths and frequencies based on their unique molecular composition. Fluorescence and phosphoresce displayed by some minerals are proof of energy transmission in some minerals. In theory, these vibrations and energies could work in benefiting and uplifting our mood, mind, and health in a considerable manner, often in the way essential oils or aromatherapy would. While some of these benefits may be real, the scientific community views research as proof of effectiveness \u2014 and in this case, there hasn't been much of it. From what I've read and understood, modern Crystal therapy is based on traditional concepts borrowed from Asian cultures, most notably the Vedic (Hindu/Buddhist) concept of chakras. Chakra is an ancient asian meditation (yoga) practice and originates from the Sanskrit word, translating to 'wheel'. Chakra represents seven different centers of energy of the human body, and each believed to be connected to an emotional state. It is believed that by balancing these energies your emotional, physical and spiritual wellbeing would benefit. Attuning an individual's energy levels or 'chakra' to perform optimally is not always about giving a boost of energy, rather about brining down a certain energy component to the correct level in cases of hyperactivity. It is indeed a balancing act. For anyone interested to learn more about Chakras - I found this video helpful. (10mins) So how and why are Chakras associated with gems/crystals? The association is attributed to color (a component of light energy) and the scientific theory of selective absorption. Each of the seven chakras are associated with a specific color. The colors, you'll notice, are the spectral hues meaning the colors of the rainbow. The energy residing in gemstones emits light (a form of energy) of a particular wavelength and frequency based on its body color. Chakra beads work on the premise of passage of light (energy) through the gemstone into the human body - when a ray of light strikes passes through the gem crystal to the human body, its speed slows down and upon contact and in the process of its passage, selective absorption happens addressing the deficit of particular energies in the body bringing harmony to the chakra centers. Again, in theory this sounds legit. But there's no scientific research proof of the chakra balancing component of this theory. I am by no means an expert on chakra balancing nor, healing crystals, through some internet research I decided to purchase the following gemstones to create myself a chakra bracelet: Amethyst - Crown Chakra (relates t0 spirituality and is the highest chakra) Lapis Lazuli - Third Eye Chakra (has to do with your articulation/Throat Chakra (responsible for communication and self-expression) Aventurine - Heart Chakra (deals with the ability to be empathetic, and compassionate) Blood Stone - Heart Chakra (same as above) Citrine - Solar Chakra (has to do with your determination and self-esteem) Carnelian - Sacral Chakra (linked to our capacity to evolve and change) Tiger's Eye - Root Chakra (is about feeling \"grounded\"\u2014for a sense of safety and security) I wore my chakra beads on a daily basis for the past three months, and have to admit, I did feel a change in myself. I found myself feeling a lot calmer i.e. more balanced than my usual self - for instance I caught my self reacting to situations different to how I would have normally. At times like that I assumed it had something to do with the chakra beads, but it's not like I was constantly thinking about the beads and its energy. Most days I forget I had jewelry on until it was time to take them off. There's no way for me to know if this new found calmness is actually due to the beads, or some kind of unconscious psychological state due to placebo effect. I do nonetheless find my self wanting to always wear the beads - I enjoy the feeling of calm it brings me, psychological or not, I feel that it brings me some sort of healing. While this is my personal experience, there isn't any scientific evidence to prove the healing properties of crystals. Such a study may prove difficult to design and possibly the reason why no solid research exists in this department. According to crystal healers it is extremely important to get a proper gemstone recommendation before wearing a gem crystal for healing purposes, especially to cure illness. While I'm not sure how exactly the healers determine what's best for an individual, what I've read is that wearing an unsuitable crystal can backfire. If you are curious about healing properties of crystals, my recommendation is to get proper guidance - there are so many resources online, or you can consult a practitioner.
