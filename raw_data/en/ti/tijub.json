We care about the health and well being of our family and pets. We want our home to be a place where all the stress of life is washed away in a feeling of safety which, for most, includes a clean, peaceful space. As aromatherapists and holis c praconers, our clients come to us to achieve a state of wellbeing, part of which includes receiving their consulta on in a safe, healthy environment. But what about the toxins that are found in commonly used commercial cleaning products? Are our best e orts at crea ng cleanliness also crea ng side eects that are a health hazard? Researchers tell us that the air inside our ghtly sealed home and o ce is oen more polluted than the air outside due to trapped fumes from these products, and from scented candles, chemical air 'fresheners' or fragrances. What are these toxic substances and what e ects do they have? In the ar cle, \"Toxins in Household Cleaning Products,\" (hp://green.wikia.com/wiki/Toxins_in_Household_ Cleaning_Products ) we are told that despite being highly diluted these substances are \"bioaccumula ve, meaning the chemicals do not purge easily from the body and over me even mild exposures can add up to toxic levels.\" These toxins manifest in three ways as: 1. Carcinogens - Carcinogens cause cancer and/or promote cancer's growth. 2. Endocrine disruptors - Endocrine disruptors mimic human hormones, confusing the body with false signals. Exposure to endocrine disruptors can lead to numerous health concerns including reproduc ve, developmental, growth and behavior problems. Endocrine disruptors have been linked to reduced ferlity, premature puberty, miscarriage, menstrual problems, challenged immune systems, abnormal prostate size, ADHD, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and certain cancers. 3. Neurotoxins - Neurotoxins alter neurons, a ecng brain acvity, causing a range of problems from headaches to loss of intellect. And the main culprits are: Formaldehyde: Formaldehyde is commonly known as a preserva ve. Many people do not know that it is also a germicide, bactericide and fungicide, among other func ons. Formaldehyde is found in household cleaners and disinfectants. It is also present in nail polish and other personal care products. Formal- dehyde is a carcinogen. Organochlorines: Organochlorines result from the combinaon of hydrogen and carbon. Some types are highly deadly, such as DDT. OCs are bioaccumula ve and also highly persistent in the environment. OCs are present in pes cides, detergents, de-greasers and bleaches. OCs are also present in drycleaning fluids. OCs are carcinogens and endocrine disruptors. Styrene: Styrene is a naturally occurring substance derived from the styrax tree. Styrene is most commonly used in the manufacture of numerous plascs including plas c food wrap, insulated cups, carpet backing and PVC piping. Styrene is also found Con nued.....page 5 \u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reservedGo Green for a Healthy Home and Office: Clean with natural ingredients and essential oils Shellie Enteen, RA, BA, LMT 5Connued.....page 4 in floor waxes and polishes and metal cleaners. Styrene is a known carcinogen for those exposed to high levels at manufacturing plants as well as an endocrine disruptor. Exposure may a ect the central nervous system, liver and reproduc ve system. (*note: the carcinogenic e ects of styrene for those not directly involved in manufacturing are s ll being studied.) Phthalates: Phthalates are most commonly used in the manufacture of plas cs. Phthalates are also used as carriers for perfumes and air fresheners and as skin penetraon enhancers for products such as moisturizers. These chemicals are classi ed as inert and as such no product-labeling requirements exist for phthalates. They are endocrine disruptors and suspected carcinogens. Phthalates are known to cause hormonal abnormali es, thyroid disorders, birth defects and reproduc ve problems. Volale Organic Compounds: (VOCs) VOCs are emied as gases suspending themselves in the air. VOCs include an array of chemicals, some of which may have short- and long-term adverse health e ects, and are present in perfumes, air fresheners, disinfectants and deodorizers. VOCs commonly include propane, butane, ethanol, phthalates and/or formaldehyde. These compounds pose a variety of human health hazards and collec vely are thought to be reproduc ve toxins, neurotoxins, liver toxins and carcinogens. It may surprise us to hear that symptoms of this toxic exposure include: \"headache, backache, s joints, nausea, diarrhea, asthma or allergy a acks, dizziness, memory loss, stuering, premature puberty, low sperm count, reduced motor skills, sudden mood swings, dyslexia, ADHD, an -social behavior/au sm and birth defects, among others.\" Clear the air: There are some healthy ways to clean that are simple, inexpensive and e ecve. Far from causing health hazards, they will boost the immune system and have a posive eect on the mind and emo ons. They do require pu ng the product together, but the experience and e ects from cleaning this way is well worth the small e ort to do so. All you need is white vinegar, baking soda, water and some an sepc, an viral essen al oils of your choice. You can use well cleaned spray bo les from your former cleaning products to save money and recycle, too! Note: vinegar cannot be used on marble surfaces. Cleaning Spray: for countertops, other surfaces, mirrors, windows, massage table and face cradle, use the powerhouse an bacterial, an viral, anfungal, anmicrobial essen al oils of Lavender, (Lavendula angusfolia) or Lavindin (Lavendula hybrid) (which is far less expensive) and Tea Tree (Melaleuca alternifolia). Create a pleasant aroma by adding a citrus oil like Bergamot (Citrus bergamia), Orange (Citrus sinensis), Lemon (Citrus limon), Grapefruit (Citrus paradisi) and/or a spice like Cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) or Clove (Eugenia caryophyla a) (Anthemis nobilis) or Thyme (Thymus vulgaris)* or a or Pine (Pinus sylvestris).

Use 10 mls (250 drops approx.) of a blend of the chosen essences with Tea Tree and Lavender predomina ng. Dilute this into 2 cups of Vinegar and pour into a 32 oz spray bole, then top with water. Shake well before using. Cleanser: For a 'scrub' cleanser that will remove oil buildup, sprinkle Baking Soda on the area and spray with the cleaning blend, then clean with a moistened so scrub sponge. Floors: Use the same blend or create a Pine or Citrus based blend. Add 15 to 20 drops of the blend to 1 cup of white vinegar and add that to water and damp mop. To freshen carpets, put 15 to 20 drops into 2 cups of baking soda, mix well and let stand for a few minutes. Sprinkle onto carpets (can be used on cloth covered furniture, too) and allow that to stand for 10 minutes (keeping pets and children out of the room) and then vacuum the powder away. Fragrance: Get rid of commercial air fresheners and 'sck ups' and exchange your petroleum based scented candles for unscented soy candles. Add an essence or blend to mel ng candle wax. Or create an air spray with essen al oils and water, or use a diuser with true essen al oils. Try using di erent scents for di erent seasons, too. More ps: Make a safe an bacterial soap that won't create chlorine gas when it hits water...buy unscented casle soap (Dr. Bronner's is a good source) and add Lavender and Tea Tree. Hydrogen Peroxide can be used on its own to disinfect and remove stains.Those who clean with natural products and essen al oils have no ced the di erence (and not just in the cleaner air, but o en in posi ve behavior shi s in family members) and get many posi ve comments. It can even be a pleasure to clean with natural ingredients!

The key to choosing green in- gredients and cosme cs for your business lies in determining how you personally de ne green. Based on the con flicng informaon presented online, you may be surprised to nd that the very same ingredients you have been cauoned to avoid are actually some of the greenest ingredients on the market. Deciding the right ecological path for your company is in important process, and picking the ingredients for your company is an essen al component to this. The following is the scienc informa on that may aid you in making the green decisions that are right for your business. \"Natural\" vs. \"naturally derived\"The ne line between \"natural\" and \"naturally derived\" ingredients is hard to decipher, since many ingredients have a e back to a natural resource. There is added confusion caused by the fact that purely synthe c ingredients have a place in crea ng safe and a ordable cosme cs. Completely disavowing all synthe c ingredients would leave the majority of consumers priced out of the cosme c world and the types of products on the market very limited. Dening the right eco-ethical path for your business has never been more important than it is today, with so many consumers seeking a ordable, natural, organic and overall green cosme cs. Understanding the ne line between \"natural\" and \"naturally derived\" is the most important factor in choosing the best ingredients for your business. Products that are 100 percent natural are those made from ingredients from nature which simply need to be processed in order to express the ingredient from the natural resource. Examples include vegetable oils (olive, coconut, avocado, etc.), bu ers (shea, mango), essenal oils (lavender, orange, tea tree), dis llates (rose, orange blossom, lavender), clays (green, pink, kaolin), herbs, salts, sugars, waxes (beeswax, carnauba, candelilla) and so forth. Ingredients that are naturally derived are dependent on natural ingredients as a star ng point; however they are altered by some sort of chemical reac on. All of the ingredients used for the reac on may be natural, but the new ingredient is considered naturally derived due to the processing. The perfect example of this is sodium lauryl sulfate, which is created by a chemical reac on between the fa y alcohol acids (lauryl alcohol) of coconut oil with sulfuric acid (formed naturally by the oxida on of sulde minerals) which is then neutralized with the addion of sodium carbonate (naturally occurring). Another example of a chemical reac on that creates a cosmec product is cas le soap, which is considered natural but is formed by a similar chemical reac on as sodium lauryl sulfate. Cas le soap is made when lye (sodium or potassium hydroxide) reacts with oil through saponi caon (hydrolysis of an ester under basic condi ons to form an alcohol and the salt of a carboxylic acid (carboxylates), which creates soap. Sodium lauryl sulfate and cas le soap are both created through a chemical reac on of a plant derived ingredient; however one is vili ed and the other is praised as the ul mate natural product.* Chemistry is the ul mate measuring s ck in deciphering the origin of an ingredient. Determine which side of the line between natural and naturally derived that you want your business to fall into and review ingredients according to the standards that work for your philosophy. Con nued.....page 9 \u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reserved 9Sorting Through Green Kayla Fioravanti, RA Connued.....page 8 Biorenewable carbon indexThe biorenewable carbon index of cosme c ingredients is based on the value of the percentage of carbon derived from a biorenewable resource. Biorenewable ingredients are those that originate from animal, plant or marine material. The carbon index number is calculated based on the number of biorenewable carbon divided by the total number of carbons in the en re molecule. The index is one way that formulators are working to reduce the cosme c industry's carbon footprint. Examples of plant derived surfactant ingredients that score a 100 on the biorenewable carbon index are caprylic/capric triglyceride, ammonium lauryl sulfate and sodium lauryl sulfate. Synthec Ingredients Truly synthe c ingredients are those that are considered completely man-made. There are some ingredients that are more ethical to use in the synthec form rather than naturally sourced, and others that are best when taken from nature. A good example of an ingredient that is best sourced from nature is chamomile essen al oil (natural) versus chamomile fragrance oil (synthe c). Chamomile (Roman and German) essen al oil has a long list of properes that bene t your skin and health. Chamomile fragrance oil contains phthalates, undisclosed synthe c ingredients, and delivers absolutely no bene t to the skin. The synthe c ingredients used to make fragrance oils are known to cause derma s, eczema and allergic reac ons while chamomile essen al oil has been shown to treat those very condi ons. In this case, the natural and synthec versions have completely opposite e ects. A prime example of an ingredient that is more ecofriendly when sourced from a lab rather than from nature is potassium sorbate. The synthe c version is developed in the lab. Most natural companies claim that their potassium sorbate is naturally derived from mountain laurel ash berries. However, the volume produced by each berry is so low that it would take mountains of berries to produce a large enough Con nued.....page 10 The International Federation of Professional Aromatherapists invites enquiries from aromatherapists regarding: In Essence our quarterly professional aromatherapy journal - a dynamic and versatile forum for contributors of international standing Annual Weekend Conference held in the U K - an opportunity to be informed and inspired!

The energy needed to produce it and the massive waste of le over material from the plant makes it a clear cut case of synthe c lab created product being the green choice. Organic Whenever and wherever possible, organic and wild-craed ingredients win hands down over pescide and chemically fer lized crops. The debate in the cosme c industry over cer caon and denion of organic nished cosme cs has been raging for years and is not due to quiet down for quite some me. Organically cer ed cosme cs are complicated by the fact that the list of acceptable ingredients for them was designed for the cercaon of organic food. The emulsi caon, preservaon and stabiliza on needs of foods are vastly dierent than the needs of cosme cs. The market is flooded with cosme cs that are cer ed by organizaons with wildly di erent standards of organic. The key to organic decisions can best be found on the product's ingredient list. Fair trade The market-based social movement known as Fair Trade is designed to help producers of ingredients in developing countries to promote sustainability. Fair trade prac ces for cosme c ingredients are related to exports from developing countries to help producers and workers move towards economic self-su ciency and stability. The most noteworthy ingredients for fair trade in the cosme c industry include co ee, cocoa, sugar, herbs and essen al oils. Non-toxic The use of the term \"non-toxic\" in the cosme c industry generally relates to ingredients that are not toxic to the human body, meaning they do not result in health problems for the consumer. Determining whether or not an ingredient is non-toxic or not can be misleading and confusing when many online resources are used. Many companies make the claim that ingredients used by their compe tors are toxic in order to sell their own products. There are also organizaons that try to scare consumers into believing that more regula on in the cosme c industry is necessary in order to protect consumers from cosme c companies to ful ll their own agendas. There are two very good resources available to consumers and businesses that are unbiased and scienc. The best cosme c ingredient book on the market is A Consumer's Dic onary of Cosme c Ingredients by Ruth Winter. The best resource on the internet for unbiased and scien c informa on is the Cosmec Ingredient Review (CIR), found at www.cir-safety.org. I recommend relying on informaon from the CIR because it thoroughly reviews and assesses the safety of ingredients used in cosmecs in an open and unbiased manner, and the results are published in peer-reviewed scien c literature. Reduce, recycle and reuse. Help reduce the confusion in the cosme cs world by taking false informa on out of the recycling bin and reusing the truth instead. *There is a di erence between Cas le and sodium lauryl sulfate...they are both chemical reac ons, but dierent chemical reac ons resul ng in dierent products.

You may have no ced a surge in your symptoms, as well as a surge in television and radio commercials promo ng various over the counter and commercial allergy medica ons. Want an alterna ve to medica on? The rst step is to avoid contact with the allergy producing substance. You can take a lot of simple cauonary measures to avoid exposure to allergens. (Like keeping your windows closed at home, using air lters, keeping your sheets and pillows clean, and staying inside during peak pollen mes.) Use the Internet to your advantage by researching the sort of ps and steps that t into your lifestyle. For many, relief may be obtained naturally. A saline rinse (un-medicated) can do wonders for clearing and relieving nasal ssues. O nce you get past the weird feeling, it's actually very soothing. Essenal oils can be used to relieve nasal allergy symptoms.

Popular culture and adversing have cre- ated the sense that rooms are only clean and fresh if they smell \"clean.\" What you're not told is that air fresheners are full of chemicals that simply mask odors, hiding anything snky and exposing you to poten ally dangerous phthalates. Synthec fragrances are chemically-derived. Over the past several years, the phthalates in chemical fragrances have been linked to everything from asthma to childhood cancer. Recent studies have indicated that pregnant women and infants are especially at risk when exposed con nually to synthec fragrances. Does this mean your home should not be scented at all? Not necessarily. Pure, plant-derived essen al oils oer pleasing and therapeu c aromas without exposing you and your family to synthe c chemicals. Of course, the best way to ensure that your home smells fresh is to clean it regularly and avoid common odors like pet messes and garbage. You can also create your own spray air fresheners and cleaners without using any synthe c chemicals. For example, make an an bacterial spray using pure water and essenal oils like White Pine (Pinus strobus) and Lemon (Citrus limon). If you love crea ng a sense of atmosphere with aro- mas in your home, we recommend using essen al oils in a diuser. Play around with combina ons. You may nd that you end up with a favorite morning aroma\u2014maybe something with s mulang citrus oils or roman c florals. Then, in the evenings, you may be more drawn to calming aromas like for aroma c purposes can be a lot of fun, especially if you're a beginner and you're largely unfamiliar with the therapeu c components of essenal oils. Relax and follow your nose. This spring, throw out your aerosol and plug in synthe c air fresheners and breathe easily knowing you're ridding your home of harmful chemicals.

With the discovery of the anbioc uses of penicillin, and the many related compounds that followed, the medical community moved away from the tried and true aromatherapy of the past to a new age of manufactured an biocs. Penicillin, and the new classes of an biocs that have emerged since Fleming examined that rst piece of moldy bread, have saved countless lives but their indiscriminate use has lead to problems of an bioc resistance that opens the door for a re-examina on of the role of essen al oil therapy in infec on control. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an increasingly invasive and costly cause of both nosocomial and community acquired infec ons. MRSA infec ons are believed to cause considerable illness and mortality. Resistance of S. aureus was noted soon a er the common place use of penicillin in the 1940's despite warnings regarding the poten al for resistance by Fleming, and as stated by Schnaubelt (1995), \"an biocs are sll recklessly overprescribed, oen for condi ons for which they are ine ecve.\" Buckle (2003) provides addi onal reasons for anbioc resistance including: pa ents do not complete their en re course of an bioc therapy; anbiocs are prescribed for viral illness for which they are ine ecve; anbiocs are used prophylac cally without rst idenfying bacterial sensivity; anbiocs are frequently added to animal feed; and an biocs are used by the food industry and sheries. The current problem with overuse of man-made an biocs goes beyond the problems of anbioc resistance include: crea ng chronic infecons; allowing infecons to take hold; suppression of immune response; and an increase in the development of childhood asthma and increased incidences of chronic fa gue syndrome (Schnaubelt, 1995). Commonplace use of mupirocin ointment as a prophylac c and to decolonize pa ents with MRSA has lead to increasing incidences of MRSA resistance to mupirocin (Demling & Waterhouse, 2007). The scope of MRSA infec on is growing at an epidemic pace worldwide and it is a major cause of wound infec on and bacteremia. Although originally primarily a concern among hospitalized pa ents, most MRSA carriers now reside in the community (Demling & Waterhouse, 2007). According to Klevens, populaon based surveillance data obtained from 9 study sites in 2005 determined that there were 8987 observed cases of invasive MRSA with 5250 (58.4%) community onset, 2389 (26.6%) hospital onset, and 1234 (13.7%) community associated (2007). The standardized incidence rate of invasive MRSA was 31.8 per 100,000 with incidence rates highest among those age 65 years and older. Based on CDC data, the proporon of infec ons that are an microbial resistant has been growing. In 1974, MRSA infec ons accounted for two percent of the total number of staph infec ons; in 1995 it was 22%; in 2004 it was 63% (CDC MRSA in Healthcare Se ngs Updated, 2007). Kuehnert reviewed Na onal Hospital Discharge Survey data from 1999 and 2000 to calculate US hospital discharges lis ng S. aureus infecon as a discharge diagnosis and from this data the number of MRSA infec ons was es mated. Based on this data review it was es mated that 291,542 hospital discharges with an S. aureus diagnosis occurred annually from 1999 to 2000 and the overall rate of MRSA infec ons was reported to be 43.2% (2005). Of all the useful proper es of essen al oils that have been researched, an microbial ac ons of essen al Con nued.....page 18 18 \u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reservedThe Role of Essential Oil Therapy in Infection Control: MRSA Christine M. Gentry, RN, IAC Connued.....page 17 oils are one of the most extensively studied and research has been ongoing since the 1880's. Research has included both whole oils from aroma c plants with a long history of use as well as the individual chemical components of oils. \"Essen al oils are made up of an ever changing melange of ac ve main ingredients, secondary components, and trace compounds which lend oils their scents. The composion of an essen al oil depends upon many factors such as growing condi ons, climate, methods of harves ng, and dis llaon\" (Schnaubelt, 1995). Over and over this research concludes that essen al oils provide promising op ons for use in conjunc on with, or as a safe and e ecve alterna ve to, manufactured an biocs that are becoming increasingly ine ecve today. To date there have been numerous in-vitro studies however much more needs to be done in the area of in-vivo studies and human clinical trials. The most commonly used in-vitro method for determining suscep bility of microbial pathogens to oils is the agar di usion technique in which a bacterial strain is inoculated on agar medium and a series of sterile paper disks are saturated with oil at di erent concentra ons to determine a zone of inhibi on. The resulng aromatogram shows how e ecve each essenal oil is based on the size of the zone of inhibion and essen al oil concentra on (Buckle, 2003). Aromatograms are used widely in France and England where aromatherapy has been embraced more readily in mainstream medical prac ce. Michael Smith, a pathologist who performs aromatograms for numerous London hospitals, demonstrated the e ecveness of the following (Eucalyptus globulus and Eucalyptus smithi ) (Buckle, 2003). Unlike the reduc onist approach of modern medicine and pharmacology where the ac ve ingredient is sought out and isolated from a substance, modern aromatherapy stresses the importance of using the whole essen al oil for its therapeu c value as part of a holisc approach to care. It is important however to understand the ac ve molecular components that make an essen al oil anbacterial. Phenylpropanes including cinnamic aldehyde and eugenol are highly ansepc and contain an aroma c ring similar to phenols. Terpenes, which include the monoterpenes, diterpenes, and sesquiterpenes are found in some form in almost all essen al oils and are responsible for their therapeu c in the category of broad spectrum e listed pine (Pinus eecve against certain strains of bacteria (1995). Con nued.....page 19 19 \u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reservedThe Role of Essential Oil Therapy in Infection Control: MRSA Christine M. Gentry, RN, IAC Connued.....page 18 Several di erent mechanisms of ac on have been proposed regarding how essen al oils exert their bactericidal e ects. One model, common with monoterpenes, is cellular membrane toxicity. Monoterpene essen al oils are lipophilic, di use into cell membranes causing them to expand, increase fluidity, cause loss of potassium ions, and cause cellular damage. Terpenoids interfere with ATP formaon, energy metabolism, and inhibit oxygen intake (Ba aglia, 2003). Ba aglia explains that this eect on energy metabolism makes it impossible for bacteria to develop resistance to essen al oils. A wealth of in-vitro research data is available on the anbacterial proper es of essen al oils and for the purpose of this review the focus will be on essen al oils and their cons tuents that have a direct anbacterial e ect on Staph aureus and MRSA. Prabuseenivasan and colleagues (2006) presented a study on the in vitro an bacterial ac vity of twenty one plant essen al oils against six bacterial species, four gram-nega ve bacteria and two gram posi vebacteria (Staph aureus and Bacillus sub lis) at four dierent concentra ons (1:1, 1:5, 1:10 and 1:20) using the disc di usion method. Out of twenty one oils tested, nineteen showed an bacterial ac vity (dened as a zone of inhibi on >7mm diameter) against one or more bacteria with cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum), lime (Citrus auran um), and clove (Eugenia caryophyllus) showing maximum ac vity against all bacteria tested. Staph aureus was suscep ble to fourteen of the tested oils. Nostro and colleagues (2006) examined the eects of established bio on (BIC) for carvacrol and thymol were 0.031-0.125%. Scanning electron microscope observa on of S. aureus showed that a er twenty four hours in the absence of carvacrol bio lm forma on was evident but in the presence of carvacrol at concentra ons of 0.5 and 0.25 MIC bio lm was signi cantly reduced and almost absent at 0.5 MIC. The an bacterial ac on of geranylgeraniol, teprenone, and phytol, all diterpenes, against S. aureus was esmated by Inoue and colleagues using a broth dilu on shaking (BDS) method. All three diterpenes inhibited S. aureus growth at con- centraons of 0.15ug/ml and showed clear bactericidal ac vity. Geranylgeraniol suppressed bacterial growth most e ecvely at 1.25ug/ml and teprenone at 5ug/ml however at higher concentra ons inhibitory e ect decreased and beyond a certain concentra on these compounds were growth accelera ng (2005). Carson (2002) reviewed the mechanism of an - microbial ac on of tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) Con nued.....page 20 20 \u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reservedThe Role of Essential Oil Therapy in Infection Control: MRSA Christine M. Gentry, RN, IAC Connued.....page 19 and three of its components, 1,8-cineole, terpinen-4-ol, and a-terpineol on Staph aureus through me-kill, lysis, leakage and salt tolerance assays. It was found that these agents compromise the cytoplasmic membrane of S. aureus bacteria, cause loss of salt tolerance and leakage of cytoplasmic material. In this par cular study, S. aureus cells were killed by tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) while in their staonary phase of growth, a me that is usually less sensive to injury. Unlike other essen al oils and components with a mechanism of ac on that causes cell lysis, tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) did not provoke gross cell wall damage or Brehm-Stecher (2003) examined the sesquit- erpenoids nerolidol, farnesol, for their enhance bacterial permeability and suscepbility to an microbial compounds. Using disk diusion assay studies, it was demonstrated that nerolidol, bisabolol and apritone at low concentra ons of 0.5 to 2nM enhanced the suscepbility aureus erythromycin, e ecve anbioc sensizer for S. aureus in this study followed by bisabolol and apritone. This study suggests the poten al for ulizing these compounds to enhance bacterial permeability to an biocs as a means to overcome the increasing problem of anbioc resistance. The anbacterial e cacy of three monoterpenes (linalyl acetate, (+) menthol, and thymol) against S. aureus was reported by Trombe a (2005). Each of these monoterpenes inhibited growth of S. aureus and it was demonstrated that thymol (MIC 0.31mg/ml) and (+) menthol (MIC 0.62mg/ml) are considerably more toxic against S. aureus than linalyl acetate (MIC 1.25 mg/ml.) The mechanism of ac on of monoterpenes appears from this study to result from penetra on and perturba on of the plasma membrane. Lee (2007) studied the an microbial proper es of Dracocephalum foe dum, a popular essen al oil used in Mongolian tradi onal medicine. Dracocephalum foedum belongs to the family Labiatae and has been tradionally used for preven ng and curing diseases, bacterial and fungal infec ons. The terpenes make up the largest component of the essen al oil (monoterpenes 87.68% and sesquiterpenes 3.2%) with the main components being limonene, geranial, and neral.

Gentry, RN, IAC Connued.....page 20 the anmicrobial e ects of D. foedum against eight pathogenic organisms including S. aureus using agar diusion method and both direct inhibi on and eects of oil vola lity were tested. D. foedum showed marked inhibitory e ect on both S. aureus (MIC 1035ug/ml) and methicillin resistant S. aureus (MIC 572 ug/ml on MRSA2659 and 1035 ug/ml on MRSA9561.) Bearden (2008) compared the in vitro an microbial acvity of three topical wound care products against four MRSA isolates using a modi ed kill-me design. These products included benzethonium chloride 0.2% with essen al oils of tea tree was bactericidal against all MRSA strains by 6 hours and signi cantly more ac ve than the other agents against two strains. Anbacterial e ecveness of the an sepc Benzethonium chloride alone was not evaluated in this study so it is not possible to isolate the precise eect of tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) and white thyme however both have been studied elsewhere for their an -infecve proper es. A case report on the percutaneous treatment of chronic MRSA osteomyeli s in a 49 year-old male with an open le bia fracture was reported by Sherry (2001). Following unsuccessful treatment on long term anbioc therapy this pa ent was treated with an an microbial called Polytoxinol (PT) administered percutaneously via calcium sulfate pellets. At three months the wound was healed, symptoms had resolved, wound cultures were clear and the infec ve process had resolved as shown by x-ray. This case represents a possible alterna ve to long term systemic an bioc therapy. Alma (2003) evaluated the in vitro an microbial eects of Origanum syriacum (Lauraceae), commonly called Syrian oreganum, hyssop or wild marjoram. The leaves of O. syriacum are a popular Arab spice used tradi onally as a medicine, steam inhalaon, fragrance and flavor. An microbial acvity of O. syriacum at concentra ons of 2 and 4 ul/disc were compared to ampicillin, streptomycin and nysta n. This oil inhibited growth of S. aureus at both 2uL/disc (20mm zone of inhibi on) and 4 uL/disc (30mm zone of inhibi on) and was much more eecve than 10 ug/disc (16mm zone ug/disc of inhibion.) Nelson (1997) studied the vies of Suscepbility of bacterial strains to the oils was determined by broth micro dilu on with an MIC dened as the lowest concentra on of each oil that inhibited visible growth a er overnight incuba on. Tea tree oil (Melaleuca alternifolia) was the most potent oil tested with (Juniperus was found to be least potent with an MIC90 of >2%. Price (2007) presents a comparison of essen al oils and their components to the an sepc phenol. The phenol coe cient of a substance gives an indica on Con nued.....page 22 22 \u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reservedThe Role of Essential Oil Therapy in Infection Control: MRSA Christine M. Gentry, RN, IAC Connued.....page 21 of its ansepc strength compared to phenol (with a coecient of 1.0.) Of the oils listed, thymol (20.0), thyme fennel (6.2), citral (5.2), cinnamaldehyde (3.0), lemon (2.2), and lavender (1.6) are more an sepc than phenol (p. 85). The studies presented here provide compelling evidence for the use of essen al oils as an alternave or adjunct to current an microbial treatment par cularly with the prevalence of anbioc resistance. Domina ng the literature today are studies con rming the an microbial eecveness of tea tree oil (Melaleuca alternifolia) and there is no shortage of products available to the consumer containing tea tree oil for everything from acne control to an sepc hand wash and hair products. Nelson (1997) expressed concern over the poten al for such widespread cosme c use of tea tree and other essen al oils in dilute concentra ons to render them less e ecve as anmicrobial agents. Carson (2006) reported that clinical resistance to tea tree oil has not been reported despite medicinal use in Australia since the 1920's. Conven onal anbioc resistance has not been demonstrated to in fluence tea tree oil suscepbility. Price recommends avoiding any possible resistance to essen al oil therapy by always prescribing the use of 3 or 4 oils in combinaon (2007). Essen al oils by their nature vary in composi on from year to year and their varied mechanisms of ac on against the target organism make resistance unlikely.

Essen al oil therapy addresses not only infec on but it can enhance physical, emo onal, and spiritual health as well through other ac ve proper es. Essen al oils, parcularly in addressing infec on and wound care, are ansepc, an-inflammatory, an -spasmodic, calmave, and tonic and when used responsibly by knowledgeable prac oners oer a holisc approach to care. Clinical use of aromatherapy is well respected and widely prac ced in France and Germany as an extension of orthodox medical prac ce. The studies presented provide clear evidence of the enormous therapeuc potenal for essen al oil therapy and make a compelling case for con nued study in infecon control and wound care.

From Blog site CARE2 I rst moved to Malaysia in 1996, when I got a job with the Malaysian government to help them get their emerging tech sector o the ground. A er my contract expired and I had dabbled in the Internet bubble with a start up, I set up my own consul ng company that, broadly speaking, would commercialize ideas, technologies and policies. One of my clients, the venture capital arm of the Malaysian government, hired me to help gure out what to do with palm ber waste. Malaysia is the largest exporter of palm oil in the world and also the world's second largest palm oil producer. They handed me a sample of the raw material and I immediately saw some serious potenal to turn this renewable resource into something useful. The le over palm ber was mostly incinerated or dumped in land lls, causing many negave environmental impacts. I had been personally a ected by the incinera on of this material - the air pollu on was at mes so bad that I would get dizzy and my allergies became acute. So my mission began.The kernel of an idea to turn the waste into packaging was already there, but not really fully developed. The idea really took o aer my return to North America in 2004. A er living overseas for 15 years and not being accustomed to North American consump on pracces, I was overwhelmed to see how our society had become so addicted to plas c packaging and realized the moun ng waste problem. I knew that palm ber has the tensile strength of tanium, I knew it is mouldable, and what's more, I realized this natural, renewable resource had the poten al to help address several challenges: Malaysia's air pollu on caused in part by incinera on of palm ber, the sustainable development of Malaysia's palm oil industry, and North America's addic on to plas c and increasingly over flowing land lls. Earthcycle Packaging Ltd. was born! Since 2005, Earthcycle has developed an innova ve way to turn palm ber waste into environmentally responsible packaging alterna ves such as produce packaging, food trays and other applica ons. We source our raw ber from planta ons in west Malaysia that have been reviewed against principles and criteria established by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). It was really important to me that I would establish a company that from the beginning, would ensure that the sources of raw material we use have not replaced any primary forest, nor converted any Environmentally Sensi ve Areas (ESA) for the purpose of palm oil produc on. Our packaging follows the cycle of nature - our product life cycle starts with a natural renewable resource and through compos ng, ends up as humus, creang valuable nutrients for the soil. All our products have been cer ed as home compostable and will break down in the compost within 90 days. In the mean me, Earthcycle has become a trusted, award-winning leader in providing cer ed home compostable packaging across North America, Con nued.....page 25 25 \u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reservedShannon Boase Creates 'Down to Earth' Packaging from Palm Fiber Shannon Boase, Founder and CEO of Earthcycle Packagaing Ltd.

Many who be- come Aromatherapists do so because they have an acute sense of smell. This apprecia on for scents inspires us to burn scented candles, di use essen al oils and make aromac room sprays to create ambiance in our homes. You can also create an aroma c ambiance in your backyard, pa o, or balcony by adding plants that have scents you enjoy. What is Aromatherapy? Most de nions include 'the use of essen al oils', however the most basic denion is 'the use of aromas to bring about healing (physical, spiritual, emo onal, mental)'. Don't underesmate the healing e ects of the scents enjoyed right from the plants themselves in your own garden. Of course, there are physical bene ts to the aromatherapeu c garden; the exercise you get digging, plan ng and weeding; and your lungs will appreciate the fresh air. Addi onally, having a quiet place outdoors to relax and enjoy the wonderful aromas is very therapeu c for the spirit and psyche. Close your eyes and picture your favorite spot to relax; now, imagine what it smells like. Our sacred space should a ect all the senses: it should be visually appealing, comfortable, and pleasing to the ears (the quiet sounds of nature, a waterfall, and wind chimes). Most importantly, though, is smell; the scents we experience a ect us on an emo onal level. Deciding which aroma c plants you want in your garden can be a challenge; there are so many wonderful choices! You need to consider your climate zone and what plants you are able to grow in your area, the amount of space you have and then choose your favorite aromas. Below are a few sugges ons from my list of favorites; visit local botanical gardens, nurseries, and garden centers to get ideas of which aromac plants will grow best in your area. Zone informaon included here refers to the USDA plant hardiness zones; to nd out what zone you are in, go to: hp://www.usna.usda.gov/Hardzone/ushzmap.html Trees If you have the space for trees they can make a nice border or a shady area in the center of your garden. Plant evergreens on the north side of the house for protecon from the winter cold, plant deciduous trees on the south side to give shade in hot summers and allow sun in the winter. Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp.; Myrtaceae) the scent opens up the lungs and is invigora ng. Eucalyptus likes mari me climates without a lot of temperature fluctuaon. It does well in the Paci c Northwest to Southern California, and some species, e.g. E. robusta, do well in Florida. Fir (Abies spp.; Pinaceae) its scent is grounding, increases intui on, and helps bring clarity to mind and spirit. (Hardy to zone 3; depending on species can grow to a height of 20 to 70 feet; grows best at higher elevaons) Magnolia (Magnolia grandi flora, M. spp; Mag- noliaceae) is known for its large fragrant white blossoms.

(Zones 9-10, height 10 to 20 feet) Mimosa, Silk Tree (Albizia julibrissin, Fabaceae) the house I grew up in had a large mimosa tree in the front yard, which we loved to climb. The sweet scent of its fuzzy pink flowers sll brings back happy childhood memories of carefree summer days. (Hardy to zone 6; 20 to 40 feet tall; can be invasive) Orange (Citrus sinensis; Rutaceae) the fragrant white blossoms are used to produce Neroli essen al oil. Their scent is one of the most sensual and exo c; it helps clear the mind of nega ve thoughts and overcome anxiety. If you don't have a lot of space, dwarf varie es can be planted in containers on a pao. (Hardy to zone 9; moist soil)Mock Orange (Philadelphus lewisii; Hydrangeaceae) not related to the citrus, and not grown for its fruit; this shrub has highly aroma c flowers and grows well in colder climates. (Hardy to zone 5) Pine (Pinus spp.; Pinaceae) has a refreshing scent; it is known for its cleansing proper es, and can help cleanse unwanted or nega ve thoughts from the mind. (Hardy to zone 4, well drained soil, most are drought tolerant; depending on the species they can reach anywhere between 20 to 80 feet in height and 10 to 40 feet wide) Perennial Vines Vines make a great cover for walls, fences, and trellises, and can be used to create arches or arbors. Honeysuckle (Lonicera spp.; Caprifoliaceae) has fra- grant golden flowers whose scent inspires a posi ve outlook.

(Perennial; hardy to zone 5; can be grown in containers) Design There are many ways to design your garden,depending on how involved you want to get. It can be as simple as a few well-laced pots on a balcony or pao, or a corner of the backyard with a table or bench surrounded by aroma c plants, or a large area with walkways and arbors. Plant fragrant flowers such as jasmine, lavender and roses near or under windows and their scent can be enjoyed from indoors as well. The important thing is to make your garden a space that you will enjoy. In choosing what to plant, consider colors (which ones appeal to you), blending of scents, di erent bloom cycles, and the amount of maintenance and care di erent plants require. Choose colors that are visually appealing to you:White/Green Garden: jasmine, gardenia, white roses, sweet alyssum (white), rosemary, valerian (white), and moon flower Purple/Pink Garden: lavender, Virginia stock (pink, purple), sweet alyssum (pink, purple), violet (Viola wisteria chamomile, Virginia stock (yellow, white), honey- suckle, yellow roses Like blending essen al oils to create a perfume, you can blend scents in your garden to help set a mood: Calming: lavender, chamomile, lemon balm Sensual: jasmine, orange blossom/mock orange, rose Meditaon: patchouli, r, pine, rosemary Consider when plants bloom (some bloom early in the season, some bloom late, and others bloom all season); group plants together that bloom at di erent mes so you always have some that are in bloom. Flowers also open, or are more fragrant, at di erent mes of the day. If you like to relax in your garden in the evening, create a 'night-blooming' garden of plants such as moon flower, evening stock bicornis), nicoana (Nicoana addion to the bene ts of sing and relaxing in your garden and enjoying its fragrance, you can use many of these plants to create aromatherapy products. Con nued.....page 31 \u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reservedCreating an Aromatic Garden Deborah Halvorson, RA 31Connued.....page 30 You don't need a s ll to get the healing bene ts of the essenal oils. Making infused oils, dream pillows, bath herbs, and potpourri are great ways to use the flowers, leaves and roots from your garden. Loons and body care products using exo c essenal oils such as rose, melissa (lemon balm), violet, calendula, honeysuckle, jasmine and neroli can be quite costly. If you have these plants growing in your garden you can create amazing skin care products at a fracon of the cost by making infused oils. Calendula and lemon balm infused oils are wonderful for soothing and repairing the skin. Chamomile infused oil is good for reducing in flammaon. Place your plant material ( flowers, leaves, or roots) in a clean jar and pour in enough of your choice of vegetable oil (olive, sweet almond, jojoba) to cover the plant material. Cover and place the jar in a warm spot, away from direct sunlight, shaking daily and adding more oil if necessary to cover the plant material. A er two weeks, strain the oil into a clean jar, making sure all the plant material has been removed. If you need an infused oil right away, you can use a crock pot to speed the process. Place the plant material in the crock pot and cover with vegetable oil, then heat it on the lowest se ng for four to six hours; strain out the plant material and pour the oil into clean bo les or jars. Infused oils can be rubbed onto the skin or can be used as a base for your creams and lo ons. Herb infused oils can also be used to make ointments and balms. Lavender burn/sun burn ointment: 8 ounces almond oil1 ounce beeswax 4 ounces (by weight) fresh lavender flowers (2 ounces dried)\u00bd cup aloe gel Melt the oil and beeswax in the top of a double boiler. Add the lavender flowers and simmer gently for about half an hour. Strain the mixture through a muslin or paint strainer. Using gloves so you don't burn yourself, squeeze out the remaining liquid. A er straining out the lavender, blend the mixture with aloe gel using a hand held mixer. Pour into clean containers, label and date. Apply to burns, sunburn, cuts and chapped lips. Con nued.....page 32 \u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reservedCreating an Aromatic Garden Deborah Halvorson, RA 32Connued.....page 31 Vapor balm: 4 ounces olive oil\u00be ounce beeswax1 ounce fresh eucalyptus leaves1 ounce fresh peppermint leaves\u00bd ounce fresh thyme Melt the oil and beeswax in to the top of a double boiler. Add the herbs and simmer gently for about a half hour. Strain the mixture through a muslin or paint strainer. Using gloves so you don't burn yourself, squeeze out the remaining liquid. Pour into clean containers, label and date. For colds and conges on, rub the ointment over the chest, back and throat. If you grow roses, you can make your own 'rose water'. Harvest your rose petals early in the morning, and allow them to dry for a few hours or overnight. Take a large pot and place a medium sized bowl in the center. Place the petals from eight to ten roses in the pot around the outside of the bowl, and ll the pot 2 inches from the top with dis lled water (there should be no water inside the bowl). Place the pot lid upside down on the pot. Bring the water to a boil; the steam from the pot will rise, run down the lid to the handle in the center and ll the bowl with rose water. Pour into clean bo les and refrigerate. This makes a wonderful facial cleanser/toner. To create your own bath herbs blend, all you need is a muslin bag (or a large cloth tea bag). Roses, lavender, chamomile, calendula, lemon balm, and rosemary are some of my favorites for relieving tension and creang relaxaon. Harvest the leaves and or flowers and place them in the muslin bag. Tie the bag to the bath tub faucet and allow the hot water to run over it as you ll the tub. Once the tub is full, place the herb bag into the water. Relax and enjoy! Herbal pillows, or 'dream pillows,' are wonderful for helping children (and adults) sleep. Take two square, round, or heart shaped pieces of fabric and sew them together around the edges, leaving two to three inches open. Mix one half cup of flax seed to one cup herbs, and pour the mixture into the fabric. S tch the opening shut. Herb choices include chamomile, lavender, catnip (Nepeta cataria), lemon balm, roses and valerian root. Conclusion Your aroma c garden may take weeks, months or even years to create; it will also evolve over me as you get to know the plants and their needs and growth cycles. Growing and using your own aroma c plants is de nitely a worthwhile experience and has numerous emo onal and physical health bene ts. My garden is my 'sacred space' where I go to relax and unwind, enjoy the vivid colors, the sounds of the breeze through the trees and wind chimes, the birds and buerflies that come to visit, and most of all the aromas of the herbs and flowers. Have fun as you create and enjoy your own aroma c garden.

Go green with natural relief from bugs Kelly Holland Azzaro, RA, CCAP, LMT 33Is something bugging you when you go outside to enjoy your garden or talking a sunset walk? Apart from the bi ng bugs themselves, perhaps it is the commercial bug repellent products laden with toxic chemicals and irrita ng synthe c scents. It amazes me that people actually use these and similar products on themselves and even on their pets. Spring and summer outdoor ac vies are not complete without the company of some unwanted pests such as mosquitoes, flies, gnats and wasps. As more informa on comes forward on nega ve reacons that can be caused by ingredients in the commercial products used to deal with this problem, people are seeking alterna ve and natural ways to keep bugs at bay. Here are a couple of easy recipes for crea ng an aromatherapy based blend that is safe to use for both people and their animal friends (dogs/horses and farm animals, not for use with cats, birds or with infant children). 3 ounces Aloe Vera Gel (Aloe barbadensis) 1 ounce Witch Hazel (Hammamelis virginiana) or Lavender Hydrosol Pure Essen al Oils: 10 drops Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus citriodora) 10 drops Lavender (Lavandula 10 (Nepeta cataria) Pour the witch hazel or hydrosol into a jar, blend with the essen al oils then mix in the aloe vera gel and s r well. Cap the jar ghtly and shake well before each use. The aloe vera gel will take on a slightly cloudy white appearance which is natural. Apply a thin layer of the gel blend to exposed skin areas, such as the arms and legs. Do not use on the face. With pets such as horses, apply the blend to their chest area, legs and comb a bit through their tail and mane. I have received a lot of posi ve feedback with a similar blend that I call 'Bug O Gel' for use with people and it also works well for horses and farm animals. The gel also works double me as natural relief from actual bug bites and itching caused by bites, including flea bites. Added bonus: I had one report that it cleared up a case of poison ivy rash. Need more relief from bugs? Try the same essen al oils in a mist spray blend combined with a 50/50 blend of Witch Hazel and Lavender Hydrosol. I use both the gel and the spray for our horses when the summer heat kicks in and horse flies are at their peak. Place ingredients in a mist spray bo le and store in the refrigerator. Shake well before each use. If irrita on occurs from any of the above blends, discon nue use. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Do not get near or in the eyes. These blends are not for use with infants, cats or birds.

Trade controls (interna onal commercial trading strictly by permit only) will apply within 90 days for Aniba rosaedora (Brazilian rosewood), proposed for lis ng by for Bulnesia sarmientoi (holywood) from the Gran Chaco region of Central (from which guaiacwood oil, acetylated guaiacwood oil and guaiyl acetate is produced), proposed for lis ng by Argen na. Cropwatch has long drawn a enon to the decline in the ecological status of rosewood trees (see rosewood monographs in the Cropwatch Files sec on of website), and many essen al oil users have subsequently volunteered to stop purchasing the essenal oil. Unfortunately there is always the unethical element of the trade which will carry on using unsustainable species up un l the point at which it is actually illegal to do so Cropwatch has previously named and shamed these concerns, but they seem too set in their ways to take any no ce of environmental arguments. The status of holywood (guaiacwood) trees in the Gran Chaco Na onal Park which stretches across W. Paraguay, N. & N.E. Argenna & S.E. Bolivia was recently updated by Cropwatch in its Updated List of Threatened Aroma c Plants Used in the Aroma & Cosme c Industries v1.19 (see Cropwatch Files). Guaiacwood essen al oil is actually a brownish paste mel ng at 45\u00baC and acetylated deriva ves have occupied an important place in the perfumer's pale e. But will the lis ng really make any di erence? A CITES Appendix I lis ng would have been more e ecve, especially in the case of the rosewood tree, who's survival is more in the hands of the lawless loggers. Rosewood oil from unlicensed s lls deep in the forest connues to nd its way into the essen al oils market, although some batches show unusual composi ons, prompng queries about the species it was sourced from (see Cropwatch's Rosewood biblio in the Crop- watch Files). Will guaiacwood oil from Paraguay connue to be legally available, or is it just Argen- nean origins which will be unavailable? Time will tell, but these CITES lis ngs are, at least, a step in the right direcon.

Sni an apple. Despite 9000 years of history, aromatherapy has only entered mainstream consciousness within the last several decades. Known as the simpler, natural, and more accessible sibling to perfume, aromatherapy can be seen in the use of lemon scented air at businesses trying to increase employee produc vity or at museums using 'scent orbs' to evoke the smell of an erup ng volcano or a wooly mammoth. Aromatherapy has even been used in the weight loss industry with studies showing that it's possible to lose 5 pounds in 6 months by sni ng sweet smells when hungry! Aromatherapy is everywhere, but true aromatherapy products are a li le harder to nd thanks to a surplus of inferior products that claim to tout all the bene ts without actual results. In Aromatherapy: A Complete Guide to the Healing Art, Keville and Green show readers how easy it is to make inexpensive beauty and health products at home using all natural essen al oils, as opposed to the synthe c chemicals o en used by perfume companies. With over 75 combined years of experience, Keville and Green provide more than 90 formulas to help treat common ailments such as morning sickness (spearmint), cellulite (cypress), the flu (rosemary), and oily hair (lemongrass).
