(7) In lieu of an award by the Department of Corrections in felony cases , if a presentence report indicates that a defendant has accumulated sufficient sentencing credits under this section to allow for an immediate discharge from confinement upon pronouncement of sentence, the court may confirm the amount of the credit and aw ard the credit at pronouncement.
