Our mission is to serve our patients and their families through the provision of high-quality, safe healthcare ensuring the medical readiness of the force and a ready medical force. WRNMMC is One Team! Every member of our team directly supports our mission. Over the past year, WRNMMC achieved many successes and implemented multiple performance improvement projects to build on our excellent reputation in high-quality, safe clinical care; academics and research; fiscal responsibility; and leadership. In the Fall of 2019, we implemented Leader Walkrounds, also known as Gemba Rounds. These regular leadership rounds with our clinical and administrative leaders and staff built and nurtured relationships with our teams and improved the WRNMMC Board of Directors' understanding of the successes and challenges our team members face every day in the Gemba...\"the place where the work is done.\" Gemba Rounds improved leader presence, unit morale, and the safety and quality of the care we provide while elevating common issues and concerns to the organizational level for solution and action. WRNMMC prioritized implementation of the I-PASS system to enhance team communication, patient and staff safety, and quality of care across the hospital. I-PASS, an evidence-based communication tool, directly improves transitions of patient care between healthcare teams leading to improved safety and patient outcomes. I-PASS will continue to expand across all aspects of care at WRNMMC and will address and improve WRNMMC's number one patient safety concern... communication in transitions of patient care. In 2019, WRNMMC received numerous accreditations and certifications for outstanding care and service including reaccreditation of our Level 2 Trauma Program by the American College of Surgeons and recognition as a meritoriously performing hospital by the American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program placing us in the top 10% of all hospitals nationwide for all-cause and high-risk morbidity and mortality. More than 30 of our clinicians were acknowledged with Master and Associate Master Clinician distinctions reflecting excellence in clinical outcomes, superior patient satisfaction, high clinical volume, and contributions to medical education and research. WRNMMC Hospital Dentistry received zero findings on their 2019 Environment of Care inspection. WRNMMC experienced multiple improvements in customer service, access to care, and multidisciplinary healthcare in 2019. The Pediatric Patient-Centered Medical Home opened a Saturday Clinic in November focused on newborn follow- ups and urgent care patients. The entire Pediatric PCMH team worked diligently over several months to implement this great service for our youngest Warriors. In collaboration with the National Capital Region-Medical Directorate, the WRNMMC Pain Initiative Team improved patient and clinician education and revised policies and treatment guidelines reducing concurrent prescriptions for opioids and benzodiazepines by 35 percent compared to a 4 percent annual decrease in the civilian healthcare sector. Finally, a six-year collaborative effort between the Directorate of Nursing and the WRNMMC Medical Staff culminated in the implementation of the Accountable Care Unit (ACU) program on our medical-surgical inpatient wards. Created to improve communication, safety, quality, and clinical skills, the ACUs will utilize the power of the multidisciplinary team to continually improve healthcare for inpatients at WRNMMC. A proud member of the National Capital Consortium for Graduate Medical Education with the Uniformed Services University, Fort Belvoir Community Hospital, and Malcolm Grow Clinic and Surgery Center, WRNMMC graduated more than 300 healthcare and administrative professionals from 63 graduate medical programs in 2019. These graduates will go on to lead military medicine and provide care to our Warriors and their Families around the globe. Moving forward, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center will continue to lead the Military Health System with an unrelenting focus on safe, high-quality healthcare; innovative research; and world-class graduate medical education providing an ever ready medical force while maintaining a medically ready force. As always, we will keep the patient at the center of everything we do. We are proud of what we achieved in 2019 and we look forward to exceeding those accomplishments in the future.

The course has 480 hours of clinical practicum with emphasis on dialysis in the combat theater. Simulation The Department of Simulation is a founding member of the NCR Simulation Consortium. It is the only simulation program in the DOD, and one of only a few in the world to receive maximal accreditation from both the Society for Simulation in Healthcare and American College of Surgeons. Our Simulation Center developed and ran a new readiness training symposium in conjunction with ETR leadership. This initial training developed critical operational medicine skills within the staff at Walter Reed, ensuring optimal readiness posture of our medical staff to deploy in support of the operational forces at a moment's notice. The department also created a first of its kind training curriculum in conjunction with the Practical Nurse Course (PNC) to strategically train targeted skills gaps identified in the current training paradigm. This has allowed the PNC to maintain increased training output of new Army Licensed Practical Nurses without sacrificing quality of training. Dr. William Sweeney, research chair and director of the Walter Reed surgical simulation fellowship, created novel curriculum for evaluation and treatment of the military working dog for general surgeons. This training was created based on feedback from theater where units were bringing their injured working dogs into the aid stations and forward surgical teams for treatment of battle injuries. The course is the only known course of its kind in the world specifically training surgeons on this critical part of deployment surgery. Quality Improvement All of our GME programs find ways to integrate innovation and change into everyday education. Teaching quality improvement is a goal of GME faculty. With mentorship, our GME trainees have participated in quality improvement projects that have improved the care of our patients here at WRNMMC and across the MHS. Excellence and Innovation Our trainees are leaders in the healthcare system. Some of our trainees are influencing the health system at a national level on a variety of committees and projects. In addition, GME has been instrumental in teaching military and civilian healthcare providers to ensure world-class medical care across our nation.

Most of the interns, residents, and fellows who make up our trainees have been competitively selected from either the Health Professions Scholarship Program as graduates from some of the finest civilian medical schools in the country, or from our own military medical school, the USU, collocated on the Naval Support Activity Bethesda (NSAB) campus. The faculty, likewise, are chosen specifically for their teaching interests, clinical skills and diversity of experiences. Both faculty and residents are actively involved in medical research with extensive publications in major medical journals and academic presentations routinely performed both nationally and internationally. WRNMMC's programs prepare participants not only for board eligibility and certification, but to be leaders in military medicine. The programs are all accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) or by specialty-specific accrediting bodies. PAGE 24 | 2019 WRNMMC ANNUAL REPORT Walter Reed National Military Medical Center | Page 25 Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Pediatric Intensive Care Unit Mother Infant Care Center Our primary care services include our three Pediatric Primary Care Medical Home (PCMH) teams as well as our Adolescent and Young Adult PCMH team. Serving the primary care needs of more than 10,000 beneficiaries as well as almost 2,000 children and adolescents of our NATO partners. Subspecialty Services Child Abuse and Forensic Pediatrics Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics Genetics Pediatric Cardiology Pediatric Endocrinology Pediatric Gastroenterology Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Pediatric Infectious Diseases Pediatric Nephrology Pediatric Pulmonology Pediatric Rheumatology Subspecialists do outreach at many of the military clinics in the NCR bringing specialty care closer to our patients' homes. The Children's Center employs a patient and family centered care model that promotes team-based care in both our primary care and subspecialty settings. Our staff works to coordinate clinic visits, laboratory testing and radiology studies on the same day in one location. Our outpatient and inpatient teams are fully integrated and include Social Work, Nutrition, and Child Life services. Wait times for pediatric subspecialty appointments are one-fourth of the national average. In addition to our satellite clinics throughout the NCR, we have expanded telemedicine services and virtual consultative services to address the needs of families stationed locally, nationally, and overseas. Nowhere are the strengths of the Children's Center more apparent than in our 25 pediatric multidisciplinary clinics. During these condition focused half day clinics, physicians and specialists will evaluate children with complex medical conditions allowing for quality coordinated care within a single office visit, minimizing the number of appointments and trips to the hospital.The Pediatric Primary Care and Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine medical homes are improving our compliance with STI screening. This project involves all aspects of care delivery. In addition, the PCMH is instituting a screening test for Adverse Childhood Events (ACE) with associated follow-up care at the four- year-old well child visit and working to engage as a pilot site for a DoD healthy steps program for at risk families. The Emergency Department serves as the safety net for military beneficiaries in the NCR. Twenty-one board certified Emergency Medicine physicians and physician assistants, 35 nurses, and 15 corpsmen/medics, medical support assistants, core administrative staff, patient transporters, and housekeeping deliver critical health care to over 30,000 patients annually Our Department and the hospital have renewed their ACS's certification as a Level II Trauma Center and have partnered with the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services System (MIEMSS) to further pave the way to bring trauma patients into our department. As the hospital looks to expand these capabilities, the Emergency Department will play a key role stabilizing these patients when they first arrive. The medical center is working to expand its capabilities beyond trauma care. As WRNMMC pursues The Joint Commission (TJC) and Maryland certification as a stroke and ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) center, the Emergency Department once again will play a pivotal role in these hospital-wide initiatives. By working together to meet the requirements of TJC and MIEMSS, we will achieve new milestones that ensure WRNMMC's stroke and cardiac patients receive the latest innovations of care that have been shown to improve outcomes. The Emergency Department recently partnered with the John Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory to further improve all areas of emergency health care delivery. One large project from this partnership includes a revamping of our patient flow to include a \"nurse first\" triage system to immediately screen patients on arrival to the Emergency Department, consistent direct bedding when available, and team-based care delivery. Working with our inpatient colleagues, we have piloted a more efficient admission process to further optimize patient care. The Emergency Department first launched its \"Fast Track\" in 2015 and continues to be highly successful. By diverting lower acuity patients from the main Emergency Department, we are able to consistently deliver prompt care to our patients needing urgent care. The Neurology Department offers numerous unique capabilities that support the warfighter and their family The Directorate of Medicine, the largest at WRNMMC, has oversight of approximately 1,300 exceptional personnel across 64 clinics in the Departments of Medicine, Pediatrics, Emergency Medicine and Neurology, with additional oversight of the University Family Health Clinic at the Uniformed Services University. The patient remains at the center of all we do in delivering high- quality, safe care, as we support readiness, the warfighter and families. \u2014 CAPT Saira N. Aslam, MC, USN Director for Medicine The Directorate of Medicine is the largest Directorate at WRNMMC, with oversight of 1,300 personnel across 64 clinics in the Departments of Medicine, Pediatrics, Emergency Medicine and Neurology, with additional oversight of the University Family Health Clinic at USU. Our clinical services completed over 260,000 patient encounters over the past year. We ensure appropriate primary and specialty care access for our patients and focused on active duty access to align with our primary mission of support to the warfighter. In addition, we focus on creating a foundation for resourcing clinical care requirements, establishing a directorate level quality program, and moving forward with key strategic projects aligned with priorities above to ensure efficient delivery of high quality health care to our patients. The Department of Medicine The creativity and ingenuity of our clinical teams continues to bring world class care to our beneficiaries. Modern Health Care Solutions Open access colon cancer screening Electronic consultation \u2014 bringing endocrinology expertise to our patients Mobile dermatology units Nighthawk Program to increase patient safety Our collaborative services range from gastroenterology, dermatology and nephrology to even more specialized services such as Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Neurophysiology. Gastroenterology provides state-of-the-art colon cancer screening to beneficiaries with high-definition optical colonoscopy or virtual CT scan colonography (VTC). We also offer open-access screening where patients can fill out an online medical questionnaire and have a gastroenterologist review their health history. Our scheduling department then arranges appointments for the procedure during a phone consultation, sparing patients an office visit and allowing increased access to care for symptomatic patients. Endocrinology initiated the electronic consultation (eConsult) service to improve efficiency of care delivery, access to endocrine care and patient satisfaction. The eConsult Initiative allows us to take specialty care to remote areas of the region where there is a general lack of specialty access and reduces the inconvenience of our patients needing to travel a long distance to receive care. Coupled with our Secure Messaging service and in collaboration with our primary care colleagues, this innovative service reduces the burden of unnecessary visits for our patients while allowing them to continue receiving the same high-quality care rendered remotely. Dermatology continues to evolve in its practice of superior medicine. Dr. Jeffrey Lackey and Dr. Jason Marquart expanded the regional dermatology presence through Mobile Dermatology Units (MDUs) that have taken enhanced care to FBCH, Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center and Naval Health Clinic as well as the U.S. Capitol, the White House Medical Unit, Camp David and the Pentagon.

Establishment of Sexual Assault Forensic Exam Program As of last year, the only option for victims of sexual assault at WRNMMC who desired a Sexual Assault Forensic Exam (SAFE) were referred to Shady Grove Medical Center, Rockville, Maryland (SGMC) via a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). In conjunction with our Emergency Department, the Directorates for Surgery and Administration, DMS was able lead the way for WRNMMC's first SAFE capabilities ensuring we are fully supporting our Active Duty service members. During a recent unannounced drill by regional Navy Sexual Assault Prevention team, WRNMMC SAFE program received excellent ratings from the inspection team. Hematology/Oncology Quality and Patient Experience Project Oncology unit Welcome Guide was developed to help our patients understand the unit and hospital processes. Finally, a Patient Activity room was created which offers a physical space on the unit for patients and their family members to engage in physical fitness activities, art therapy and play games. Palliative Medicine Service The Palliative Medicine Service provides consultation on complex pain and symptom management in the setting of chronic, serious illness, enhanced communication during complex medical decision making for decisions around goals of care and education, and symptom management in hospitalized patients who are actively dying. Primary and Specialty Care Access DMS team has worked closely with leaders from our PCMH clinics to ensure adequate staffing to maintain access. We have worked to balance military and civilian physician staffing across our primary and specialty clinics to ensure appropriate staffing for our specialty care benefit delivery and also appropriate staffing for our Graduate Medical Education programs. We have also partnered with the NCR Integrated Referral and Appointing Center (IRMAC) to streamline the specialty appointing process. The Allergy and Immunology Service (In collaboration with the Infectious Diseases Service) has made significant strides in addressing antimicrobial resistance at WRNMMC and in the NCR and the MHS. A significant impediment to the efficient function of these ASPs is the 10-20% of patients with a documented penicillin allergy. Since the inception of the WRNMMC ASP, Allergy and Immunology has piloted an inpatient penicillin allergy assessment program. Allergy and Immunology also proactively screened and evaluated in-patients with a listed penicillin allergy. Testing has led to a 97% clearance rate of those patients. Emergency Department actively engaged in process improvements to bring innovations in care and further increase the quality of care delivered. We introduced a triggered sepsis pathway to bring bundle care to our most critical patients. We have partnered with the Department of Pediatrics to bring essential resources to our younger patient population. Newly improved nurse-triggered order sets are being implemented to improve the efficiency of care for all patients presenting to the Department. Incorporating evidence-based medicine like the \"HEART Score\" into our daily care for chest pain patients introduces another initiative to improve quality for all of our patients. To further improve our processes, we hired a Public Health nurse to communicate laboratory results and coordinate care with our patients. There are currently 40 active quality improvement projects in the Directorate of Medicine. Some additional highlights that illustrate the wide ranging focus of these initiatives directed at improving the care of our patients to include: Revamping admission flow to minimize Emergency Room dwell times for the patient. The development of a valvular heart disease/anti- arrhythmic medication patient tracker in order to ensure surveillance echocardiograms/EKGs (respectively) are being conducted at appropriate intervals. Improving the notification process for patients undergoing cancer screening with fecal occult blood test. Multidisciplinary rounding with medical teams, nursing staff, social work, and discharge planning services to improve patient transitions form the hospital and length of stay. Implementing and tracking long-term cancer screening follow-up. Establishment of an NCR Asthma database to track required follow ups and longitudinal care of asthmatic patients. Improving creation and submission of advanced directives, easily accessible to primary care managers and admitting teams, for the NCR. Developing of a database of all patients on biologic therapy to improve compliance with recommended immunizations.members not present elsewhere in the DoD. We have the only inpatient neurology ward service, inpatient adult and pediatric epilepsy monitoring unit, and the only autonomics testing laboratory in the DoD health care system. We are the sole DoD medical center with fellowship- trained sub-specialists in neuro-immunology, epilepsy, autonomic disorders, and neuro-oncology. The USU Neurology Department maintains strong ties with our department supporting medical student and resident education. Over 9,500 patients were cared for in the adult neurology clinics and 1,300 children and adolescent dependents were cared for in the pediatric neurology clinic. We are over 125% of our full time equivalent (FTE) goals over the last 8 months of FY2018. Access for all appointment types was under 30 days (for the majority of the fiscal year) civilian wait time: >3 mos Looking into the future, the department strives to expand acute stroke care as part of the Trauma/STEMI/ Stroke initiative throughout the NCR. We plan to use this initiative as a springboard towards becoming a certified, acute stroke center. Furthermore, our epilepsy service will continue to expand epilepsy surgery capabilities including evaluating patients for novel, surgically implanted treatment options for refractory epilepsy patients (e.g. NeuroPace). Hematology/Oncology Service played a key role in creating the first US system to screen for genomic abnormalities to match tumor types to therapies. The APOLLO network will look at a patient's genes (genomic analysis) and the expression of those genes in the form of proteins (proteomic analysis) in order to create the nation's first system in which cancer patients are routinely screened for genomic abnormalities and proteomic information to match their tumor types to targeted therapies. The field of medicine is constantly advancing. Hospital and health system training and education programs are increasingly important to help employees improve their skillsets to positively impact patient care to include: Resuscitative Medicine training and certification for the entire NCR, The Pentagon, The White House, WRAIR, and USU, with over 3000 students annually. Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) Basic training and recertification, Tactical Combat Casualty Care training for pre-deployment, and Trauma Nursing Critical Care for all active duty throughout the NCR.Pediatric Hematology/Oncology fellowship established a process for off therapy follow-up and transition of care between pediatric and adult providers for our young adult patients and survivors of childhood cancer disseminated to other MTFs with pediatric hematology/ oncology patients. This process influences the practice of military and civilian health systems. Residents in the Department of Pediatrics are currently supported by over 70 teaching faculty from WRNMMC and USU to prepare 33-35 residents and 16-20 fellows per year while incorporating a military-unique curriculum. Residents provide world-class care in our PCMH, engage in over 48 core pediatric and military- relevant learning modules, participate in international global health engagements and humanitarian assistance missions and seek opportunities to attend courses such as: the neonatal STABLE course, Military Medical Humanitarian Assistance Course, Deployment and International Health Short Course, Global Medicine Course, Tropical Medicine Program, and the Combat Casualty Care Course. Pediatric Endocrinology fellowship made screening for depression and eating disorders for all adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes standard of care at all routine diabetes outpatient visits. This screening resulted in improved detection of these disorders leading to their management and improved overall diabetes care. Pediatric Hematology Oncology Service held its inaugeral annual Pediatric Cancer Symposium at WRNMMC to provide innovative information in Oncofertility to over 120 attendee. They secured a 2 year grant to provide an Art Therapist dedicated to our families fighting pediatric cancers, and we have furthered our transition of care programs to include sickle cell patients. Neuro-Immunology plans to initiate an academic, quarterly meeting including the programs at NIH and Georgetown as a forum to enhance faculty and resident education by collaborating on difficult cases. Sleep Fellowship program participates in sleep research totaling more than 2 million dollars in funding. Inpatient Care Focus Department of Medicine's inpatient teams average over 500 admissions per month on the inpatient Medicine, Cardiology, Hematology/Oncology, Pediatrics, Neurology, Medical Intensive Care Unit, Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, and the Neonatal Intensive Care Units. We partnered with the Safe and Reliable team to build a culture focused on patient safety and quality across both our inpatient outpatient units.

NICoE introduced several new vehicles to increase staff communication and interaction and promote continuous improvement. These vehicles include an every-other- month internal, electronic newsletter, Intrepid Voices; leadership rounds that provide an opportunity for staff throughout the organization to engage with the NICoE leadership team; and an initiative that provides opportunities to help new and existing staff members bring their ideas to improve patient care and research to leadership. Educating clinicians and researchers through hands- on experience allows NICoE to influence care within both the MHS and civilian sectors, nationally and internationally. In 2019, 21 students received hands-on training at NICoE through internships, fellowships, and young professional programs. Throughout the year, NICoE's education team successfully conducted 35 didactic and clinical education lectures to enhance the knowledge of NICoE and other hospital staff and the global community about TBI diagnosis and treatment best practices. More than 350 continuing education credits were provided. NICoE hosted 51 distinguished visitor tours in 2019. International visitors represented more than 12 countries. Distinguished visitors represented national and international military, federal government, and academia eager to learn more about the NICoE's success in understanding and treating TBI. This effort allows NICoE to share its clinical and research expertise, communicate the NICoE story to key stakeholders, and solidify NICoE's vision to be a global leader in TBI care, research, and education. PAGE 32 | 2019 WRNMMC ANNUAL REPORT Walter Reed National Military Medical Center | Page 33 The Directorate for Quality has the responsibility of enhancing the delivery of safe, high quality care through expertise and support for organization-wide activities in patient and occupational safety, process improvement, patient and staff experience, accreditation compliance, and risk management. In 2019, the Quality Team supported implementation of multiple evidence-based practices that will lay the foundation for transformational changes needed to accelerate Walter Reed on its journey toward high reliability. I am grateful for the commitment and passion of our Quality Team and their support for the delivery of safe, high quality care to the heroes of this Nation and their families. \u2014 Dr. Felicia F. Pehrson Director for Quality DIRECTORATE OF QUALITY Improvement of the Main Operating Room electronic debrief to streamline tracking of staff, equipment, supply, instrument and preference card issues. The new process has a 90% debrief compliance rate with 100% of reported issues being addressed and corrected. Training 623 staff members in various levels of lean six sigma and process improvement methodologies Teaching 632 new staff members the Fundamentals course of TeamSTEPPS (Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety) Developing 50 new TeamSTEPPS Master Trainers for WRB, Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center, Naval Health Clinic Patuxent River, Fort Belvoir Community Hospital, Naval Health Clinic Annapolis, Lakehurst Naval Health Clinic, Malcolm Grow Medical Clinics and Surgery Center, and Dilorenzo TRICARE Health Clinic. Our Joint Commission Accreditation department uses a systematic approach to ensure that Joint Commission standards are continuously exceeded, working closely with PI to develop targeted solutions for areas of improvement. During our annual Mock Survey in May, we identified ten command-level opportunities and multiple departmental and stakeholder-specific opportunities for improving the safety and quality of care and reducing risk in the care environment. We facilitated 11 monthly Director's Quality and Safety Grand Rounds which provided 11 hours of educational credits to hundreds of WRNMMC staff members. We facilitated \"Just Do It\" self-assessment, Senior Enlisted Leader Environment of Care, Command Tracer, and other ongoing survey readiness assessment and improvement activities. The Experience Office is comprised of the Patient Relations Service, which monitors and reports on patient experience via survey data with real time problem resolution; and the Resiliency Service, which focuses on building staff resiliency. We constantly strive to improve our services and enhance each patient's experience while supporting our staff. In 2019, we developed a recognition program for staff and clinics identified by the Joint Outpatient Experience Survey as the \"Best of the Best\"; developed and implemented a Patient Family Partnership Council which has established a new lending library in the America Pharmacy and provided feedback on the new WRB public website; and provided weekly updates to the Board of Directors to promote leadership awareness of the patient and staff experience. Patient Relations provided customer service training for Medical Support Assistants, addressed beneficiary concerns involving more than 1,658 patient encounters, and helped increase Interactive Customer Evaluation (ICE) submissions which soared to 1,944 in the first 11 months of 2019 (a 45% increase from 2018). Our Resiliency service completed 36 unit climate assessments, more than 100 onsite trainings, and multiple one-on-one counseling sessions to more than 50 staff members; increasing outreach activities by more than 50%. Risk Management supports organizational risk identification and assessment, and the development of prioritized, systematic risk reduction strategies and process improvement activities to provide safe, high-quality patient care. We've been developing new processes and procedures to align with the new DHA Clinical Quality Management Procedure Manual, covering topics such as: Adverse action due process procedures Impaired Healthcare Provider Program Adverse and no-harm event management DIRECTORATE OF QUALITY High reliability is a single-minded focus by the entire workforce to identify potential problems and high-risk situations before they lead to an adverse event. Our directorate's top three accomplishments in 2019 involve laying the ground work for WRB's journey to high reliability through the implementation of: Daily Safety Huddles where significant safety, quality, or service concerns from the last 24 hours, as well as high risk, out-of-the-norm activities or issues anticipated in the next 24 hours, are presented among directorate leaders to provide a shared understanding of events and risk across the organization in order to mitigate risk and harm at all levels. Leadership Walk Rounds when directorate leaders visit the front-lines of care to identify concerns, process issues, and opportunities for improvement. Walk Rounds help leaders gain sensitivity to front- line operations and promote a culture of safety. Learning Engagement Boards (LENS) which are digital or analog boards that display key processes, measures, and improvements at the unit level to enable effective communication, huddles, and training. We also developed and implemented a Patient and Family Partnership Council to promote collaboration in the delivery of safe quality care with volunteer patients, family members, and staff. In pursuit of transparency, in January 2019, WRB became the first military treatment facility to submit data to the Leap Frog Group, which scores hospitals on their overall performance in keeping patients safe from preventable harm and medical errors. The Patient Safety department focused on eliminating preventable patient harm, and used an internally developed dashboard and patient safety reporting system to facilitate leadership monitoring of Patient Safety Report (PSR) trends. Our patient safety advocates (PSAs) embedded throughout the organization addressed PSRs in a timely and effective manner. During 2019, we developed enhancements to the PSR database, dashboard and reporting features, and installed the PSR system at Naval Health Clinic Patuxent River and Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center, expanding availability of the system to ten MTFs across the NCR. Ongoing development has been instrumental in maintaining an overall PSR closure rate of 90% or greater. Occupational Safety (OS) focuses on occupational and staff safety to mitigate and eliminate staff harm by safety event monitoring and proactive inspection and monitoring through a variety of preventive programs such as the Respirator, Air Quality, and Ergonomic Programs. During 2019, we proactively engaged in the extensive ongoing construction to ensure associated hazards are continuously mitigated, hosted a Safety Fair that enhanced staff awareness of safety issues, and developed summer and winter safety videos to promote seasonal safety. Performance/Process Improvement (PI) aggregates data, identifies areas for quality improvement, and facilitates development of sustainable improvement practices. PI took on many opportunities for improvement in 2019. Highlights include: Enhancement of the PSR Dashboard to track, close, and run reports, as well as graph and analyze data. Deployment of the Patient Innovation board which displays patient safety information such as hand hygiene compliance, falls prevention data, and tracking of medication errors.DEPARTMENTS: Patient Safety Occupational Safety Performance/Process Improvement Joint Commission Accreditation Risk Management Experience Office PAGE 34 | 2019 WRNMMC ANNUAL REPORT Walter Reed National Military Medical Center | Page 35 The Directorate for Resource Management (DRM) is responsible for oversight of the Military Health Systems' largest operating budget encompassing nearly $1.2B annually for personnel, supplies and equipment. Additionally, the DRM provides human resources support for a staff of over 6,300 Active Duty military, government civilian, and contract personnel. What we do, every day, supports Service operational readiness and enables all staff to meet our mission: To serve our patients and their families. I am extremely proud to have the privilege to lead such a fantastic DRM team and could not be more appreciative and thankful for all they have accomplished in 2019. \u2014 CDR Stephen Marty, MSC, USN Director for Resource Management the financial statement for the NCR-MD and DHA in achieving financial auditability. The directorate implemented by clinic tracking of other health insurance (OHI) collection progress focused on high patient volume clinics including Pharmacy, ED, Internal Medicine, and Radiology. Since inception, monthly OHI collection totals and new OHI discovery has more than tripled from 2018 to 2019. In coordination with WRNMMC's Health Care Operations Department, the DRM revamped VA billing and collections procedures. This work enabled WRNMMC to increase VA collections by nearly $2M from 2018. Additionally, in FY 19 Walter Reed collected over 95% of VA reimbursement for authorized care in the year services were rendered. This represented one of the highest reimbursement rates throughout the MHS and was nearly a 30% increase from 2018. We awarded an Other Health Insurance (OHI) discovery contract, one of the first of its kind throughout the MHS. This will not only ensure WRNMMC is more compliant with DoD regulations, it is also projected to significantly increase annual reimbursable collections. A new contract was implemented for reviewing over $50 million in WRNMMC's aged accounts receivables. This contract addressed a critical gap identified by the Department of Defense Inspector General (DoD IG) regarding excessive aged accounts receivables (an issue identified throughout the MHS and will significantly improve both WRNMMC's and the NCR's financial audit posture. Moreover in 2019, this effort reduced 31,571 aged accounts receivable claims totaling over $19.8 million while yielding over a $1 million return on investment. Human Resources (HR) and Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation Departments Together these departments executed over 300 contract to civilian conversions, ensuring inherently governmental responsibilities were transitioned to government civilian positions. These conversions enabled more consistent staffing in critical, hard to fill, clinical positions throughout the command and resulted in more consistent staffing and better continuity for all beneficiaries. Additionally, these conversions resulted in over $7.5 million in costs savings that enabled the command the ability to hire 33 previously unfunded, high-priority, command staffing requirements. We consistently led the NCR and DHA in Defense Performance Management Appraisal Program metrics covering over 2,409 civilians, the largest command throughout the region. The departments updated the command's Total Force Management Board business rules and processes to ensure more timely and effective hiring practices and better alignment of board actions with command strategic priorities. These efforts also led to the development and implementation of tools for Directorates to track hiring actions in real-time resulting in a drastic increase in the transparency of hiring actions. The establishment of a standardized hiring practice for registered nurses throughout the command is projected to decrease hiring times by at 7-10 business days. The departments also implemented a unique Medical Expense and Performance Reporting Systems identifier for the newly established Navy Medicine Readiness Training Command (NMRTC). This enabled the NMRTC to not only act independently financially, it also provided leadership the ability to quantify and value the work conducted by all NMRTC staff and better understand the resource split between readiness and benefit delivery. With the DHA's FY20 transitions to the Integrated Resource and Incentive System, the implementation of a monthly reconciliation and directorate-level tracking of labor reporting using Defense Medical Human Resource System Internet (DMHRSi) was critical. DMHRSi ensured all 6,300 staff at WRNMMC report their work accurately using the correct labor codes in the correct work center.DIRECTORATE OF RESOURCE MANAGEMENT The Directorate for Resource Management (DRM) at WRNMMC is responsible for effective oversight and management of all command resources. In accordance with NCR, DHA, and DoD policy and guidance, the DRM has the authority to direct, manage, and coordinate budgeting, allocation, and execution of the command's Defense Health Program (DHP) funding. Additionally, the DRM has oversight of all Human Resources at WRNMMC encompassing more than 6,300 active duty, civilian and contract staff. The DRM reports directly to the Director, WRNMMC. In execution of their responsibilities, the DRM is divided into three departments: Budget, Accounting, and Human Resources. These departments coordinate closely with the other WRNMMC Directorates as well the Board of Directors in the day-to-day execution of DRM matters. In calendar year 2019, the DRM achieved several notable achievements. Budget and Accounting Departments Oversight of the MHS' largest operating budget of nearly $1.2 billion annually inclusive of approximately $350 million in military personnel costs, $270 million for civilian pay, $420 million for contracts, $160 million for supplies and equipment, and more than $40 million in annual reimbursable collections. In FY 19, WRNMMC executed nearly $850 million in operation and maintenance funding and consistently led the NCR in execution efficiency.As the DHA and MHS faced significant funding shortfalls, the DRM oversaw several key initiatives to reduce, avoid, or eliminate a total of nearly $50 million in the command's budget. This work included a complete review and analysis of all command expenditures, including all open commitments and unliquidated obligations, to ensure funds were repurposed for mission critical requirements including equipment and contract full time equivalents (FTEs). Overall, these efforts enabled a successful FY 19 year-end closeout and ensured the command had the resources required to meet all mission requirements The DRM oversaw a study of the Orthotics and Prosthetics (O&P) service led by the John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory designed to develop an operational cost model and improve the effectiveness and efficiency across the entire amputee care continuum covering more than $30 million in annual expenditures. As of December 2019, the study has already provided more than $5 million in annual savings through more effective and efficient contract oversight and supplies management throughout the O&P service. We led the NCR in audit compliance (i.e., completeness and accuracy). WRNMMC also met all NCR corrective action plan requirements and exceeded the NCR's goal for audit response timeliness. Additionally, WRNMMC was the largest MTF tested for financial integrity within the DHA, setting the footprint for all other MTFs to follow. The WRNMMC Business Analysis and Audit Readiness team worked closely with the NCR Audit Response Team and WRNMMC's General Equipment Managers throughout 2019, resulting in the first- ever posting of all General Equipment Assets on the National Capitol Region Medical Directorate (NCR MD) Balance Sheet.

Our excellent staff makes all of this possible, and we appreciate their hard work, commitment and dedication to the mission throughout 2019. \u2014 COL Benjamin K. Potter, MC, USA Director for Surgery Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation Departments Our Military Advanced Training Center (MATC) is a state-of-the-art facility where patients use sophisticated prosthetics and cutting-edge athletic equipment to move from injury to independence. Using a Sports Medicine model, many of the same fitness drills practiced by professional athletes are used to work on core strength, balance and stability. Our focus is to build our patients' strength, skills and confidence, and return them to the highest level of physical, emotional, and psychological functional ability. We recognize the importance of recreational and adaptive sports to well-being and recovery, and coordinate a community reintegration program that offers a wide variety of experiences outside the clinic setting, including trips to public venues such as shopping areas, movie theaters, restaurants and museums. The program provides adaptive sports activities such as scuba diving, therapeutic horseback riding, basketball, cycling, running and golf, which allow our patients to be challenged and help to provide meaning and purpose.The Gait Lab of the Center for Performance and Clinical Research (CPCR) uses sophisticated motion analysis equipment (27 infra-red cameras, reflective markers and six force plates) to quantify patients' movements. The information gained through motion analysis helps us to evaluate or modify physical therapy programs and prosthetic and orthotic components to facilitate improvement of functional tasks such as walking, running and jumping. Surgery Department The Department of Surgery continued to lead the MHS in surgical quality and outcomes throughout 2019. The American College of Surgeons recognized us with a meritorious recognition for scoring in the top 10% nationally for both All Case and High Risk patient outcomes. Our Breast Center reaccredited through the National Accreditation Program of Breast Centers (NAPBC) through the American College of Surgeons with a surveyor comment of \"the best I have surveyed to date.\" The Plastic Surgery service implemented a robust multidisciplinary peripheral nerve injury program to provide a more coordinated and timely evaluation of patients. The Center for Prostate Disease Research expanded its Congressionally-directed research footprint to a state-of-the-art research facility, and enrolled 400 new cancer patients into the national database. Our Organ Transplant Service is the military's only solid organ transplant program, and provides kidney transplant outcomes that exceed all civilian transplant centers in the NCR, which included 23 living donor transplants in 2019.DIRECTORATE OF SURGICAL SERVICES DIRECTORATE OF SURGICAL SERVICES DSS provides premier inpatient and outpatient surgical care for active duty, their families, and retired service members in a patient and family-centered care environment. We support academic medicine with advanced research, fully accredited residencies and fellowship training programs, and destination referral surgical care for the most complex diagnoses and advanced treatments. Home to the DoD Osseointegration Program, our multidisciplinary team seeks to advance osseintegration (OI) capability throughout the MHS, and advance complimentary technologies to improve function after amputation. Osseointegration (OI) refers to the direct, trancutaneous skeletal attachment of a prosthesis to bone. We have numerous ongoing research studies involving both upper and lower extremity patients, and we have the only upper extremity OI FDA clinical trial in the United States. In addition to translational research, complimentary research efforts include targeted muscle reinnervation and regenerative peripheral nerve interfaces, sensory feedback, and clinical outcomes research seeking to increase function, relieve pain, and improve quality of life for patients with limb loss. Obstetrics and Gynecology (OBGYN) We serve as a tertiary referral center for complicated obstetrics in the National Capital Region. All OBGYN sub-specialties are represented to provide the highest quality of definitive medical and surgical management to include: Maternal Fetal Medicine, Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Gynecologic Oncology, Urogynecology, Minimally Invasive Gynecologic Surgery, and Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy. We have the largest Women's Health training platform in the DOD, the only Tri-Service residency, and four fellowship programs.In 2019, we conducted more than 41,000 outpatient visits, 2,000 surgeries, and 1,200 deliveries; and cared for 1,600 inpatients. Other accomplishments include: Approval for the DOD-VA Joint Incentive Fund (JIF) for the Tele-Women's Health Clinic to improve specialty care and collaboration between DOD and VA partners; one of only ten projects selected. This will dramatically improve access to surgical care for our VA beneficiaries. Opening of the Walk-In Contraception Clinic, offering a full range of contraceptive options as well as contraceptive counseling for all beneficiaries. This clinic has provided effective contraception to more than 200 patients, improved patient satisfaction and service member readiness, and helped to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies. Conducting a randomized controlled trial that validated the use of a cesarean section simulator that showed significant improvement in the ability to complete the procedure as well as manage complications such has hemorrhage. Subsequently, this training model was incorporated into local residency training as well as a nationally accredited trauma course for deploying trauma surgeons (ASSET+).DEPARTMENTS: Anesthesia Obstetrics and Gynecology Orthopaedics Perioperative Nursing Rehabilitation Surgery PAGE 38 | 2019 WRNMMC ANNUAL REPORT Walter Reed National Military Medical Center | Page 39Top video posts of the year: LIVE: Welcome Ceremony for WRB Facility Dog, Sully, Feb. 2019 LIVE: Farewell to Capt.
