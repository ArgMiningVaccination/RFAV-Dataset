We are one-hour driving distance from the ancient mountains and forests of the Western Ghats in Kerala and Tamil Nadu in South India. Located in 18 acres of organic farm, AyurYoga Eco-Ashram is rated as one of the best places for Yoga Teacher Training and Yoga & Ayurveda Retreats in India. We have 4 yoga spaces in nature and a traditional Ayurveda Hospital with medically qualified doctors and therapists from Kerala. With 40 eco-friendly rooms and healthy vegetarian food, the ashram is an ideal place for spiritual seekers to explore the traditional Ayurveda and Yoga in India. Unlike the seasonal yoga studios in touristy towns of Rishikesh, Goa, Dharamsala etc., the yoga courses and Ayurveda retreats offered here are meant for people who are seeking long term lifestyle changes in body and mind, to lead a life of fulfillment. The ashram is often ranked in media among the top 10 places to study Ayurveda and to learn yoga in India. Other than love for Mother Nature and Spiritual Healing of Body-Mind, we are equally passionate about spiritual and cultural exchange between East and West, as envisioned by [Swami Vivekananda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Vivekananda). Though we are non-religious, we are humble to invite and to learn from the traditional monks / teachers from various spiritual traditions within India, including Buddhism, Sufism and Christian Mysticism. We show our respect and take inspiration from the ancient yogis of India, to all modern spiritual mystics. Nevertheless, the main purpose of the ashram is to create a suitable environment to practice spiritual sadhana, irrespective of the personal beliefs students may follow. [Yoga Teacher Training](https://bookretreats.com/s/ttc/india) Retreats at our ashram are very unique as we give equal importance to philosophical and spiritual aspects of yoga, along with intense practice of Asanas and Pranayamas of Hatha Yoga. We have an experience of teaching 88 Yoga Teacher Training courses (as of March 2023), graduating more than 1600+ graduates from 40+ countries. Our Yoga Retreats for Beginners and Intensive Yoga Retreat for advanced yogis are rated among best yoga retreats in India, and limited to 10 students per each group. The Ayurveda Hospital in the ashram offers traditional Ayurveda Treatments throughout the year, but limited to only 10 clients at one time. We also offer Ayurveda Courses taught by traditional Ayurveda vaidyas and planning to offer more educational Ayurveda seminars to the public. The charitable Trust of the Ashram is working towards educating the local farmers about the benefits of Organic Farming and also distributes the organic vegetable seeds for free of cost. We organize medical camps for the local villagers to receive free Ayurveda consultations and medication. We also offer help with improving basic drinking water, sanitation in our neighbouring villages and schools. Every year we donate the books, uniforms or basic needs for the school children in nearby villages.
