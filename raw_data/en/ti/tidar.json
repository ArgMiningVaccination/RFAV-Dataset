Lavender is world-renowned for its potency and purity , but do you know its story?BULGARIA IN BLOOM Behind the Bottle BEHIND THE BOTTLE9 Behind the Bottle A Long History The incredible properties of lavender have been recognized for centuries. The name lavender is thought to come from either the Latin words lavare, meaning \"to wash,\" or livere, meaning \"blueish.\" Lavender has an extensive history in traditional wellness, cosmetics, and culinary practices. Some historians estimate the first lavender harvests in France date back to 600 BC! And of course, it's been planted in gardens around the world for ages because of its beauty and fragrance. It's a remarkable plant, and more recently researchers have started performing clinical trials to better understand the vast benefits of Lavender essential oil. Healing Bulgarian Heritage Lavender is often associated with France, and while dTERRA does source some essential oil from France, most comes from Bulgaria. Bulgaria's climate and soil are ideal for growing floral plants like lavender, melissa, and rose. Beyond the perfect growing conditions, Bulgaria also has a rich history of cultivating high-quality florals. In the 1940s, Bulgaria was known worldwide as a top producer of essential oils\u2014connoisseurs, if you will. When the communist party that ruled the country fell in the early 1990s, everything became tumultuous, and food shortages occurred. Many lavender and rose harvesters replaced their florals with crops subsidized by the government, including corn, wheat, and sunflowers. The restoration of essential oil production\u2014an important part of Bulgarian heritage\u2014has been a slow process. But dTERRA recognized an opportunity to help both the land and people heal with opportunities to return to the crops of their past. Harvesting with Esseterre Esseterre, a dTERRA essential oil distillery, was established in Dobrich, Bulgaria, in 2015. While it's owned by dTERRA, the distillery is managed completely by Bulgarians. This facility incentivizes farmers to grow florals again and allows dTERRA to work with these skilled farmers. It all begins with farmers planting lavender fields on their land. With the history and knowledge they have, the farmers can cultivate the highest-quality lavender crops in the world. The entire annual production of Lavender essential oil occurs in just three to four weeks. During this time, Esseterre employees work around the clock to ensure the highest-quality product possible. Though the vibrant color you're familiar with occurs in early summer, the farmers actually harvest lavender in July\u2014once the bright purple color has started fading from exposure to the summer heat. Harvesting at this stage ensures higher quantity and quality of essential oil. When harvested correctly, lavender can grow back each season for about 20 years. When a lavender plant reaches the end of its life, farmers take cuttings from the old plant to propagate new lavender plants and continue the cycle. Once farmers have completed their harvest, the blooms are taken to Esseterre for distillation. Farmers are encouraged to remain at the distillery during the process. Once their harvest is distilled, farmers can choose to sell their final essential oil to a different buyer or sell it to Esseterre. Most farmers choose to sell to Esseterre because it provides a fair, transparent price with on-time payment. This economic opportunity has helped Bulgarian farmers and families begin to thrive. 9Behind the Bottle11 Giving Back to the Community Along with providing a valuable economic opportunity, dTERRA has also given back to local communities. Through C-Impact Sourcing\u00ae and the dTERRA Healing Hands Foundation\u00ae, Esseterre supports a mentor program for youths in foster care facilities. Recently, Esseterre also participated in a special project called the Wonder Garden. The Wonder Garden is an organization founded in 2018 that employs people with disabilities\u2014many of whom would have difficulty finding traditional employment. The Wonder Garden provides employees with income from the produce and flowers they grow. Esseterre has supported the project in several ways, including donating a truck to deliver produce to the market and hosting a group of Wellness Advocates who prepared the ground for planting and installed drip irrigation. To increase their production and profit, the dTERRA Healing Hands Foundation also donated funds for a tractor that's now used in the garden. Returning to Their Roots Now when you reach for a bottle of Lavender essential oil, you know its incredible story. Despite difficult circumstances, the Bulgarian landscape is adorned with lavender again. Heritage is being restored, and the world is enjoying the benefits of beautiful Lavender essential oil. Bulgaria is in bloom once more.Behind the Bottle Lavender Lavandula angustifolia Distillation Method: Steam distillation Aromatic Description: Powdery, floral, and light Plant Part: Flower Light. Airy. Floral. Lovely. These are just a few ways to describe the unmistakable aroma of Lavender essential oil. For centuries, the purple-flowered lavender plant has been beloved and widely used, and the same holds true for the plant's essential oil. Lavender is often considered the Swiss Army knife of essential oils because of its usefulness and popularity. In fact, Lavender is consistently a dTERRA\u00ae bestselling product. Lavender has remained a favorite in the essential oil world for so long because it offers powerful benefits for the skin, can help reduce occasional anxious feelings when used internally,* creates the perfect restful environment for sleep\u2014and that's just the beginning. Doesn't that sound like an essential oil you'd want to have around? It takes two years for lavender to grow from a seed to a fully mature plant. How to Use: Topical + Apply to the skin to soothe minor skin irritations. +Combine with an unscented lotion or a carrier oil and massage into the back of the neck and bottoms of the feet before going to bed. Internal + Take internally to help reduce occasional anxious feelings, day or night.* +Combine with Wild Orange in a cup of tea or glass of water for a unique flavor and internal benefits.* Aromatic + Diffuse in your children's bedrooms while they prepare for bed to create a calming atmosphere. +After washing sheets, pillowcases, and comforters, add a few drops to a spray bottle with water and spritz over the clean bedding for a lovely, refreshing aroma. *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Brannick Riggs and Greg W oodfill Dr. Brannick Riggs is a board-certified family practitioner who's also the vice president of education at dTERRA. When he's not working, Dr. Riggs enjoys spending time with his wife, Juli, and their five children in the great outdoors of the Wasatch Front. Dr. Greg Woodfill is a board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist currently living in Wilmington, North Carolina, with his wife, Ashley, and their four children. Dr. Woodfill and Ashley cofounded East Coast Oils (ECO), where they study safe and effective essential oil usage. What's Metabolic Health? You make daily choices that expose your body to various substances\u2014usually by eating, breathing, or absorbing them through your skin. These substances are metabolized into your body. The adage \"you are what you eat\" could actually be better stated \"you are what you metabolize.\" Strong metabolic health positively affects every life-giving function in the body. Weak metabolic health leads to poor well-being and early aging. Several bodily characteristics can give you a general idea of your metabolic health, like energy levels, shortness of breath, heart rate, skin problems, digestive issues, and brain fog. You can also acquire specific tests from your healthcare provider to make sure your pulse, blood glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, and C-reactive proteins are all within healthy ranges. Dr. Riggs suggests looking at your weight to evaluate your metabolic health. He says, \"If you have a BMI greater than 25, you likely have challenges with metabolic health.\" Why Is Metabolic Health Important? Dr. Riggs continues, \"Metabolic health is a serious concern. In the US, nearly 75 percent of the population is either overweight or obese. Sadly, this number has only increased during the recent worldwide pandemic. When stressed, we often turn to foods high in carbohydrates and decrease the time we spend exercising. This combination sets us up for poor metabolic health. Ask the DoctorsBehind the Bottle 15 Ask the Doctors Ask the Doctors Exercise A consistent, challenging exercise regimen is key. It's recommended you exercise for a minimum of 30 minutes with an elevated heart rate at least four times a week. You should also be walking at least 10,000 steps a day. Dr. Woodfill says, \"Exercising regularly doesn't just help you physically. It can also help you mentally and emotionally. Exercise increases alertness, acuity, and a general sense of well- being. It also releases endorphins, which some refer to as a 'runner's high.' \"In my experience, I've noticed exercise helps me carry my body better throughout the day. I feel lighter and have more energy to accomplish my goals.\" If you currently don't have an exercise routine, figuring out where to start can feel daunting. Dr. Riggs says, \"When you make small changes consistently, you'll see incredible outcomes over time.\" One of Dr. Riggs's patients wanted to reach a healthier weight. The only movement she made daily was going from her bed to the couch. Big changes seemed impossible, so Dr. Riggs helped her set achievable goals over time. First, her routine added walking to the mailbox each day. Then, it became walking to her property line. Soon, she could walk around the block. It's important to start where you are and progress from there. Whatever your exercise of choice\u2014walking, swimming, or playing outside with your kids\u2014if your heart rate is elevated, you're improving your metabolic health.\"The good news is we have considerable control over many factors that cause poor metabolic health. W e can decide today to do something about it.\" Good metabolic health improves the quality of everyday life. Dr. Woodfill says, \"As you're working on your metabolic health, there are founding premises you'll want to keep at the top of your mind. These are exercise, diet, sleep, and natural support.\"Ask the Doctors Diet Dr. Riggs states, \"You can't exercise away an unhealthy diet.\" Eating well is another fundamental building block of metabolic health. If you need to make a change, start with small, manageable modifications to your diet. \"Some people begin with the 80/20 principle, meaning 80 percent of their day is filled with nutritious food. In the remaining 20 percent, they cut themselves some slack,\" adds Dr Woodfill. \"The point is to improve little by little. You have lots of ways to incorporate nutritious food into your diet. I personally enjoy the Mediterranean diet because it provides many health benefits.\" When it comes to maintaining a healthy diet, vacations and holidays can knock you off track. However, you don't have to deprive yourself of \"cheat\" foods completely. When celebrating holidays with family or on vacation, Dr. Riggs recommends enjoying the foods you may not eat in your regular everyday diet but just make sure to get back to healthy eating habits once you're home again or the holiday is over. Dr. Woodfill believes food preparation also plays an important role in a healthy diet. \"Food is one of the great joys in life. With the right recipe and a little prep, healthy food is no exception. For example, I've learned to incorporate more spices into my cooking. Recently, I started cooking with turmeric, and I never knew how great it was for flavoring and coloring. Plus, it's good for you!\"* Don't forget fiber! The USDA recommends a fiber intake of 25 grams for women and 38 grams for men. Dr. Riggs says, \"Making fiber part of your diet can support good metabolic health. It makes glucose found within foods that have fiber, more difficult to break down. This allows the sugars to be released more slowly, not causing a large spike in our blood sugar.\" In addition to a balanced, fiber-filled diet, take dTERRA\u00ae Fiber to support proper nutrition and get in those recommended grams.* Even when you're intentional about filling your diet with healthy foods, you can still have gaps in your nutrition. Along with dTERRA Fiber, use dTERRA Protein and dTERRA Greens to ensure you're getting the nutrition you need.* Eating healthy and enjoying proper nutrition go a long way in supporting a healthy life. You'll love how much energy you have, how you function more efficiently, and how you feel more often because of a healthy diet. 17 Ask the Doctors *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.Ask the Doctors Sleep Generally, adults should sleep between seven and nine hours per night. A bedtime routine is beneficial for a sleep schedule, and essential oils can be a critical part of that routine. Dr. Woodfill says, \"Of course I've recommended Lavender, but recently I've been impressed with dTERRA Serenity\u00ae Restful Blend. Some of my patients like to relax their muscles with a percussion gun or massager and Deep Blue\u00ae Rub before turning in for the night. I personally enjoy using a blend of Lavender, Frankincense, Ginger, Black Pepper, and Fractionated Coconut Oil on the back of my neck and shoulders.\" You might try a warm or cool shower\u2014depending on where you live\u2014or meditation. Anything that encourages you to unwind from the day can be helpful and effective. Beyond a bedtime routine, it's also important to separate where you sleep from your daily activities. This separation includes avoiding screen time and working in bed. Instead, make that space a sanctuary for rest and relaxation. Natural Support Natural solutions are another reliable support for your metabolic health. The new MetaPWR product line is here to help. Dr. Riggs says the line can \"help you respond to what you consume more appropriately.\" The product line includes MetaPWR essential MetaPWR Metabolic Blend essential oil contains optimized amounts of Grapefruit, Lemon, Peppermint, Ginger, and Cinnamon Bark essential oils. You can diffuse its calming aroma to promote a peaceful atmosphere. Preclinical studies suggest this specific essential oil blend may help reduce fat cells when used internally.* More confirming clinical research is needed. MetaPWR Satiety Gum provides you with the MetaPWR essential oil blend and sugar-free sweeteners xylitol and sorbitol\u2014both of which occur in nature. Dr. Riggs notes how gum helps control cravings because it gives you something to chew on, making it a valuable tool you can use to better your metabolic health.* MetaPWR Beadlets are a convenient way to take advantage of the benefits of the MetaPWR essential oil blend wherever you go\u2014on vacation or when out running errands. MetaPWR Assist offers the MetaPWR essential oil blend, as well as naturally derived extracts, compounds, and herbal powders. It's designed to be taken before meals to support healthy blood sugar levels and reduce the digestion and absorption of sugar and complex carbohydrates.* MetaPWR Advantage includes marine collagen with nine different tripeptide types and is supported with NMN, NADH, Hyularonic Acid and several other nutrients to help promote a healthy quality of life. Genetic makeup, DNA, diet, exercise and other factors all play a critical role in how we age. However recent medical research has confirmed that two key components, named NAD+ and Collagen are essential to a healthy lifespan. In addition to these compounds, getting enough sleep, drinking plenty of water and avoiding ultraviolet rays from the sun are important. MetaPWR Advantage is a great complement to a healthy lifespan. The MetaPWR product line harnesses the power of nature and science to create safe and effective products. These new natural solutions can help you reach your metabolic health goals. Ready, Set, Go! We've discussed many aspects of and approaches to metabolic health. But remember, you must start making the foundational principles of exercise, diet, sleep, and natural support a priority now, taking small steps to create big changes. Dr. Woodfill says, \"I have confidence that if you're improving bit by bit, you can make a big difference in your metabolic health.\" 19 Ask the Doctors Check out the kids' feature, \"Goodnight, Sleep Tight,\" on page 36 for more information about healthy sleep routines for your entire family. *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Advocates fight for a cause. They speak up for others. They pursue what they believe in. dTERRA Wellness Advocates fight for the cause of wellness\u2014in their families, in their neighborhoods, and around the world. They're passionate about protecting the environment, improving their communities, and so much more. One such Wellness Advocate is Brandi Young, who personifies what it means to advocate for the things that matter. In 2003, Brandi and her husband prepared for the birth of a baby boy. When he arrived, Brandi encountered a challenge she wasn't prepared for: being mother to a baby with Down syndrome. As they did their best to care for their new baby\u2014 Clay\u2014Brandi and her husband were thrown into a world they knew nothing about. Brandi remembers, \"All I knew was we needed to find out as much as we could about Down syndrome so we could help Clay. Our love for our baby strengthened us to do what we had to do, holding on tight through this emotional roller coaster.\" Navigating New Waters When the time came for Clay to go to preschool, Brandi had dozens of questions about what school would be like for him and what learning options he'd have. Continuing her quest to learn everything she could to best care for Clay, Brandi discovered a local conference provided by the Colorado Department of Education. The conference was full, but Brandi wouldn't be deterred. She knew it was up to her to advocate for her child and get answers to her questions. After some persistence, Brandi was admitted to the conference\u2014an event that would majorly impact her family's future. At the conference, Brandi connected with other local moms whose children had disabilities. Brandi says, \"While our children struggled with different abilities, as mothers we were all going through the same struggles and even experiencing the same wins. We all had the same questions.\" After connecting with these mothers, Brandi was invited to a dinner where they talked, sympathized, gave advice, shared their stories, and felt heard. Brandi loved having this network of other mothers she could rely on and confide in. When Brandi heard the next dinner wouldn't be for a few months, she decided to organize one sooner. From that moment on, Brandi says she essentially \"took the group and ran with it.\" What started as a simple dinner with roughly eight mothers grew into a support group of 30 and beyond. Every week, Brandi added more mothers to the email group. By the time Facebook came around, the group expanded into hundreds of people. Known as Mothers Advocating for Inclusion and Acceptance, this group includes hundreds of moms from the Pueblo area who care for children with disabilities. Brandi knows what it's like to be a new mother looking for answers. She says, \"There's no reason for someone to go through this alone. W e already have so much on our plates. W e don't need to reinvent the wheel and figure this out on our own every time.\" 29 dTERRA Wellness Advocate 31 Title of article Title of articleHelping Those Who Feel Helpless Now celebrating 15 years of impact, Mothers Advocating for Inclusion and Acceptance continues empowering mothers to advocate for their children. Brandi ensures the group works with local educators, medical personnel, therapists, and other professionals who can provide these mothers with answers and their children with options. She says, \"I know what it's like to go into a school or a doctor's office and feel helpless. But I tell the mothers in our group, 'You're more powerful than you realize.' It's important to know children with disabilities should have choices, autonomy, and options. When you give children choices, they can be included. When they're included, their lives can be so much bigger.\" T oday , Clay is 18, and he graduated from high school earlier this year. Because of Brandi's advocacy , Clay's life is bigger than she ever dreamed it could be. Advice from Brandi \" If there isn't a group like this in your area, make one. Find parents who are ahead of you on the journey . Don't feel like you have to reinvent the wheel. Our group started as a simple email list and dinner once a month, so don't overcomplicate it.\" Clay's Favorite Essential Oils Brandi's Favorite Digestive Blend: A must- have in Clay's mind and pocket, Tamer is the dTERRA product he uses regularly for a calming aroma in stressful situations. Magnolia: The sweet smell of Magnolia makes Brandi feel joyful. It's an essential oil she uses daily. Spearmint: Spearmint is Clay's \"happy essential oil.\" He likes to add a drop to the shower as an effective way to wake up in the morning. Peppermint: Clay loves the flavor of Peppermint. He carries Peppermint Beadlets in his pocket all day. Citrus Bloom\u00ae Springtime Blend: Brandi says this essential oil blend is her favorite to diffuse, particularly when she wants to create an upbeat environment. dTERRA Wellness Advocate dTERRA Wellness Advocate 31 33 33 Dr. David K. Hill, Founding Executive, Science and HealthcareThe core of the AromaT ouch T echnique\u00ae and the culture surrounding it is giving service to others.35 Title of article Title of article The idea for the AromaTouch Technique was born over a dozen years ago. Dr. David Hill, Founding Executive of science and healthcare initiatives, asked himself, \"What if there were a way to use essential oils effectively and safely in every circumstance?\" So, he started developing an application method to do just that. The AromaTouch Technique took more than a year to perfect, as Dr. Hill wanted it to be simple enough for anyone to use, while still providing powerful benefits. The heart of the technique is connecting service. It's an expression of love and caring\u2014an opportunity to help others feel better and use essential oils effectively. Both the giver and the receiver benefit! This technique creates meaningful experiences for everyone. The Beauty of the AromaTouch Technique\u00ae T rue wellness has physical and emotional elements, and the AromaT ouch T echnique embraces this reality . The technique combines the benefits of human touch with the power of essential oils to create a unique wellness experience. With this technique, anyone can maximize the benefits of essential oils. The Power of Aroma Think about how a walk through an orange grove can immediately bring powerful memories from childhood to mind. Or how the aroma of cinnamon can remind you of your mom's Sunday cinnamon rolls\u2014even 30 years later. It's basic biology. There's a direct connection between your sense of smell (also called the olfactory system) and your brain's recall center, known as the limbic system. This powerful system connection occurs because of the amazing olfactory bulb\u2014a neural structure in the brain that sends input to the amygdala. Simply put, information from your nose goes directly to the limbic system. Your body contains more receptors associated with smell (over a thousand) than it does for any other sense. Because of these receptors, you can discern countless aromas with amazing sensitivity and accuracy, many of which you can't even describe. Human biology has made the olfactory system the most subtle yet effective means of inducing specific and distinct responses. This is why essential oils can so powerfully influence well-being. Beauty 3537 Title of article Title of articleThe Power of Touch We all have a deep need to know we're part of something, and the AromaTouch Technique transcends language and culture, going to the root of connection: touch. Touch is central to the human experience. Tactile communication is the first form we learn. We begin receiving touch signals in the womb, and it plays a critical role in parent-child relationships before verbal communication is possible. It's really the first sense we acquire. In recent studies, researchers have shown how powerful touch is in emotional communication. It's nearly as effective as words and facial cues. Touch can communicate multiple emotions\u2014love, gratitude, sympathy, fear, anger\u2014with incredible accuracy. Touch can even convey the tone of emotion, whether it's positive or negative, intense or subtle. It may also allow for precise differentiation between types of emotion. Along with the emotional side, gentle touch can influence physiological responses in ways other communication methods simply can't. Unlike massage\u2014 which involves powerful hand movements focused on breaking down muscular adhesions, stimulating the central nervous system, and aiding recovery\u2014the gentleness of the AromaTouch Technique offers a different spectrum of benefits. Tender touch provides stress-relieving effects for the body, triggering the almost instantaneous release of oxytocin, which is often called the love or hug hormone. What's just as incredible is the person initiating the contact can experience the same response as the person receiving it. The Power of the AromaTouch Technique\u00ae in Your Life Why should you learn the AromaTouch Technique? At its core, the technique fills a basic need we all have: to feel loved and cared for. It also helps us love and care for others. In a world where we're so isolated, the AromaTouch Technique promotes deep and meaningful connection for both the giver and the receiver.

Nothing is quite so satisfying as climbing under the covers, exhausted from a busy day . Everyone's finally asleep, and your home is quiet\u2014apart from the gentle hum of your Roam\u00ae Diffuser lulling you to sleep with the aroma of Hygge\u00ae Cozy Blend. The Lifestyle of Adventure Did you know the CDC recommends adults 18 years or older get at least seven hours of sleep a night? And the younger the person, the more hours of sleep they require. Are you soothed to sleep by a favorite calming product, like Lavender, Roman Chamomile, or dTERRA Serenity\u00ae Restful Blend? Or do you stare into the darkness, counting sheep and waiting for the sun to rise? For many people, optimal sleep seems impossible. You may feel desperate as you watch the clock tick closer to your scheduled alarm. Struggling to get quality, consistent sleep invites ramifications that are far from inconsequential. Beyond feelings of grogginess or sluggishness the next day, sleep deprivation can foster serious long-term effects. Studies have shown not getting sufficient sleep can put young children and teens at a greater risk for poor mood, impulsivity, and anger\u2014not to mention growth problems and lower grades. Whether you're an early bird or night owl, good sleep is one of the most essential elements of a healthy life. This is true for everyone\u2014from toddlers and teens to parents and grandparents. For the Busy Bee According to the CDC, one in three adults in the United States gets less sleep than recommended. A demanding schedule, urgent responsibilities, fears, stress, and constant notifications can pose major obstacles to optimal rest. Dr. Woodfill, DO, FACOOG, emphasized the importance of creating a restful environment. He said, \"Set your sleep space apart from everything else in your life. Keep all the stress in your life out of your sleep space\u2014that must be a sanctuary that's just for rest.\" For as long as the convenience of technology has been around, so too has the suggestion to set boundaries with your devices. This broken record keeps playing: remove technology from your sleep space. However, turning off the screens may not be enough to calm the mind. Studies have suggested journaling offers numerous benefits, including improved health, happiness, and sleep. Other studies have demonstrated spending five minutes before bed to write a to-do list for the next day or week can help someone fall asleep. Diffusing an essential oil like Bergamot while you journal can also help create a calm atmosphere. Count yourself among greats like Lewis Caroll, Anne Frank, and Thomas Edison by sharpening your pencil before bed. Kids' Feature 39Little Dreamers For children, the excitement of the day or the mundane nature of bedtime might cause them to fight going to sleep\u2014 making the routine anything but peaceful. Hoping your stubborn toddlers will grow out of poor sleeping patterns may not be enough. One study suggested those who have trouble sleeping in childhood were twice as likely to have the same problem in adolescence. Another study showed teens who experienced poor sleep felt more stress than their peers with good sleep quality. If you feel like your little ones aren't getting adequate sleep, it's time to be intentional about creating a consistent bedtime routine. Each step in the bedtime routine signals your kids that sleep is coming, preparing their minds and bodies. Focus on what will help create an environment that's conducive to rest. Diffuse essential oil products like Lavender or Adaptiv\u00ae Calming Blend in addition to giving them a warm bath, reading their favorite story, and wrapping them up in a soft blanket. Kids' Feature Rise and Shine Nothing makes you want to hop out of bed like a delicious breakfast. After a restful night's sleep, keep the healthy habits going with a nutritious breakfast. Try the Whole Wheat Banana Bread on page 54 for a start to the perfect breakfast. Have you ever heard the saying, \"How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time\"? Adjust your sleep routine based on your needs. Start small, consider the most beneficial changes for your routine, and continue reassessing from there. Soon you'll fall asleep as your head hits the pillow and wake up refreshed and rested before your alarm goes off. Adjust your sleep routine based on your needs. Start small, consider the most beneficial changes for your routine. Kids' Feature 4143 Title of article Title of articleI know I can't be as big or adventurous if I don't take care of myself. V oice of the V et: The Ties That Heal Human-Animal Connection Over the past 50 years, medical research has shown how animals can improve both our mental and physical well-being. In fact, a study from the 1980s revealed heart attack patients who owned pets were more likely to live longer than those who didn't. More recently, a study from the University of Missouri College of Veterinary Medicine focused on how animal interaction could increase oxytocin levels. This hormone has physical and psychological effects, including positive influence on social behaviors and emotions. Simply put, animals are amazing! I may be somewhat biased given that I've been a veterinarian for 20 years and have loved animals for as long as I can remember. Those of us who own pets or are around them regularly can't argue with the fact that pets make us happy . Recently , scientific research has suggested pets can directly contribute to our health. This concept is reflected in the number of incredible programs in which animals play a critical role, from hospitals and schools to detention centers. Voice of the Vet 4345 Title of article Title of article Voice of the Vet Dr. Y amamoto's favorite oils for a comforting environment Voice of the Vet 45 On November 19, 2019, a horrendous school shooting occurred at a high school in my area. As you can imagine, the trauma endured that day will forever impact students, teachers, staff members, and families. In the days following the tragedy, a group of trained comfort and therapy dogs were brought in to help our community deal with the emotional aftermath. And as part of the recovery process, the school created a \"serenity space\" for the students in the school's wellness center to aid their mental health. Therapy dogs continued visiting the center well after the shooting to spend time with those in need. Along with the therapy dog assistance, diffusers and dTERRA\u00ae essential oils were donated to create a calming, relaxing environment. Some of the essential oils included Wild Orange, dTERRA Balance\u00ae Grounding Blend, and dTERRA Serenity\u00ae Restful Blend. Another amazing animal program in my area is a ranch that offers equestrian therapy for special needs children. This specialized therapy challenges riders in many positive ways they wouldn't normally be exposed to. As the horse moves, the child riding it will inherently respond to that horse's movement, which encourages increased muscle movement and motor skills, improved balance and coordination, and enhanced behavior and sensory processing. Evidence that people can benefit from animals mentally and physically is abundant. The beauty of this fact is it's mutual\u2014animals can also benefit from the exchange. For instance, research on exercising via dog walking demonstrated not only improved health for the people, but also increased adoption chances for other dogs looking for \"forever homes.\" Meanwhile, the dogs on walks benefited from routine exercise and improved socialization.Another example of humans assisting animals is the rehabilitation of abused animals. Two techniques are often used in these situations: counterconditioning and desensitization. Counterconditioning occurs when a pet's reaction to a stimulus, changes from anxious and fearful to positive and enjoyable. This change is accomplished through rewards paired with exposure to the stimulus. Desensitization is low-level exposure to a stimulus that would typically cause an undesirable reaction. Over time, the pet should become less reactive through exposure, thus minimizing and eventually eliminating the negative reaction. For the greatest benefit, these two techniques are used together. Diffusing essential oils such as Lavender, dTERRA Balance\u00ae, and dTERRA Serenity\u00ae can create a soothing and inviting environment for animals experiencing anxious feelings. Topical application of Lavender, Copaiba, and Frankincense can also be effective in these situations. W e can't deny the amazing benefits people and animals can provide to each other. The research in this area will continue so there's clear scientific evidence of these benefits and how essential oils can play a crucial role. As someone who treats and adores animals, I see firsthand how important these relationships are for humans and animals alike\u2014mentally , physically , and emotionally .47 Despite what the average man on the street might assume, essential oils aren't just for women. They also do more than just smell nice (though their aromas are indeed amazing). The possible uses and benefits anyone can experience are genuinely staggering.

Here's a small sample of essential oil products that can help you in your specific circumstances, goals, and efforts. Deep Blue\u00ae: You want that healthy body, but the discomfort that hits after working out can be discouraging. Deep Blue\u2014 when diluted with a carrier oil or put to work in rub or stick form\u2014offers soothing sensations when massaged into stiff, aching muscles. Apply it and keep pushing your limits. InTune\u00ae: It can be hard to maintain intense focus for extended periods of time. Create a calming yet uplifting space for yourself as you work to stay on task by applying InTune Focus Blend.

LLV is a major step toward a lifetime of vitality, with benefits ranging from cardiovascular and bone health to energy metabolism and liver function*. Tea Tree Touch: Here's an essential oil for those with sensitive skin, which many men suffer from when shaving. Soothe those burning irritations by rolling on Tea Tree Touch for a cleansing, cooling effect. dTERRA On Guard\u00ae: It's called the Protective Blend for a reason. There's nothing quite like feeling well. Keep that feeling going strong with dTERRA On Guard, which preclinical studies suggest may support healthy immune function and the body's natural antioxidant defenses.* Use it as a blend, tablet, mouthwash, mist, beadlet\u2014your options are plentiful. Adaptiv\u00ae: Stress is so commonplace it seems like you simply have to grin and bear it. But that doesn't have to be the case. When dealing with new surroundings or situations, Adaptiv helps create an environment helpful to boosting your mood and sense of tranquility. DigestZen\u00ae: If you're feeling off after a large meal or new dish, DigestZen is there for you.

But their capacity to bless your life extends to your environment and belongings: your home, car, food, clothes, and more! Everyone deals with invasive pests. Peppermint essential oil can drive the bugs away (with Citronella and Lemongrass being other reliable solutions). Purify refreshes smaller rooms and cars, while Tea Tree, Lemon, and Wild Orange work wonders against residual odors clinging to clothes and shoes. When it comes to new, delicious twists on favorite foods, you have no limit on choices: Black Pepper, Marjoram, Lime, Turmeric, Oregano\u2014the list goes on and on.

They're the largest nesting birds, most of their homes towering above the ground in a tree's highest branches. Together, male and female eagles gather materials to ensure nest strength and structure. Interwoven twigs create a nest's pattern, and grass and moss line it for comfort in anticipation of eggs hatching. Remarkably, bald eagles return to their same nesting territory year after year if it was previously successful. These nest homes are built to last and prepare the next generation to grow, heal, and thrive. As humans, we too have a strong instinct for home, where we belong and feel safe and comfortable. Think of home as your sanctuary\u2014a place to create memories, be productive, rest, heal, and live. One way to cultivate such an environment is to reorganize and declutter, putting everything in its proper place. You transform a house into a home in small steps, one twig at a time. Share the Load \"A house is made of brick and mortar, but home is made by the people who live there.\"\u2014M. K. Soni Eagles jointly build their nests. Whether you live with family or roommates, communicate clearly that you want to share the workload. Take turns shopping, cooking, preparing food, and cleaning. The process will look different for everyone, so focus on creating an orderly home together. Share your expectations and hopes so everyone can find refuge in your home. Maybe you live alone or family or roommates have limitations that prevent them from sharing the load equally. This situation can be difficult, so set realistic goals to keep you on track. Consider what approaches will lead to the greatest benefits. Soothe your body by taking Frankincense essential oil internally, as it contains -pinene, which preclinical studies suggest may have soothing effects (more confirming clinical research is needed).* Be honest about areas you can improve and keep your goal of creating a sanctuary for yourself to thrive in at the forefront of your mind. 53 Home55 Tips and Tricks for Successful Organization Instead of adjusting your habits to fit your home, adjust your home to fit your habits. Create a sensible space for where shoes will ultimately land, not just where you want them to go. Be practical and honest about the rhythm of your home when making these decisions. Your organization will be much more sustainable this way. You might be surprised by how little you need when things are out of sight. Take your desk, for example. Grab a box and put everything (and we mean everything) from your desk inside it. Only get items out of the box when you need them. After a few weeks, you'll have a visual of the superfluous things from your desk, all in the box and ready to be donated to a good cause. When tackling larger decluttering projects, stay organized to avoid being overwhelmed. Diffuse dTERRA Motivate\u00ae as you ready yourself to take on your list of tasks. Gather four boxes and label them: keep, trash, donate, and relocate. Go over every item in the space you're organizing and sort it. 55 HomeMotivated by Momentum Before an organizing session, place a few drops of Guaiacwood essential oil under your tongue for a grounding, calming, and tranquil aroma.* Begin decluttering and reorganizing an area or room where there'll be a noticeable difference. Starting with smaller, manageable portions gives you small wins to help motivate you to move forward. If you're not sure where to begin, consider your routine. If you're instinctively going to the den to relax at the end of the day, focus there first. If what you need each night is a soothing space for your bedtime routine, begin in your bedroom. By making a clear difference in your most lived-in spaces, you'll find yourself more motivated to keep the momentum going in other parts of your home. Be deliberate with each step you take toward a more simplified, intentional way of living. Every stick you place on your nest and effort you make works together to create an intricate pattern, creating a refuge for years to come.

Guaiacwood Bulnesia sarmientoi Distillation Method: Steam distillation Aromatic Description: Earthy, woody, and sweet Plant Part: Heartwood Guaiacwood is steam-distilled from the heartwood of the Bulnesia sarmientoi tree. It offers an earthy, grounding aroma with subtle sweetness. In a base of Fractionated Coconut Oil, Guaiacwood can be used topically and aromatically, its woody scent inviting a harmonious atmosphere with every breath. How to Use Guaiacwood Topical +Apply to soothe minor skin irritations and support the skin's natural hydration. Aromatic +Diffuse throughout the day to enjoy a supportive aroma.Sourcing for the Future dTERRA\u00ae Guaiacwood essential oil is sustainably and ethically sourced from Paraguay. Working with our sourcing partner, we're changing the future of the at-risk El Chaco Forest\u2014the second-largest forest after Amazonias. Normally in the industry, each guaiacwood product export is required to be at least 25 percent wood from sustainable management. When we offer to sustainably harvest and help maintain forested land, as well as pay for any wood used to distill essential oil, local landowners are motivated to keep their forests thriving and honor their value. Harvesters leave the roots of guaiacwood trees for regeneration. Only wood from the trunks or branches is used for distillation. Plus, leftover sawdust fuels a biomass boiler, further adding to our environmentally friendly process. With our sourcing partner, we're setting an example and standard for how to make this supply chain sustainable and beneficial for everyone involved and the planet.The plant has traditionally been used since the sixteenth century by Native Americans for both wellness and ceremonial purposes.57 Connection is the soul of the human experience. We all crave a sense of belonging. Some of the deepest psychological fears are rooted in a lack of meaningful connection\u2014having no home, being misunderstood, feeling alone. A sense of love and connection with the people who are most important is foundational for finding joy and fulfillment in life. Sometimes the connection flows freely and effortlessly, and other times it doesn't. Meaningful connection takes continuous intention and determination, even with those whom we interact with regularly. How do you step out from behind the calendar and grocery list and make building and strengthening connections a priority? There's no perfect formula, but you can take several proven actions that will get you closer.Intentional Communication and Positive Touch In the organized chaos of life, it's all too easy to let communication stagnate into nothing more than coordinating schedules. Yes, this kind of discussion is essential. But meaningful, thoughtful communication about goals, feelings, ideas, likes, dislikes, dreams, desires, and expectations is vital. Deep relationships take effort and consistency, and they're as unique as the people involved. Use that uniqueness as a starting point for improving communication with intention. Literally\u2014with pen and paper\u2014schedule 15 or 20 minutes several times a week to talk with your spouse or partner. It'll give both of you something to look forward to, set the expectation of dedicated time together, and make your relationship a priority.

How does your donation help fight injustice? It's only natural to want to know how your contribution makes a difference. Faith, a 13-year-old girl, was destitute\u2014hungry and without opportunity in Tecamachalco, the sex trafficking capital of Mexico. Faith's situation seemed hopeless until she caught the eye of would-be-trafficker Melendez- Perez. He offered her food, affection, and security.Slowly over the course of a year, Melendez- Perez earned Faith's trust. Under the promise of love and a better life in America, he brought her to New York. The promise was a lie. Faith was forced into prostitution, seeing dozens of buyers a day. She was beaten, threatened, and abused for years instead of living the beautiful future she'd been promised. 61 dTERRA Healing Hands Foundation\u00ae63 dTERRA Healing Hands Foundation\u00aeBehind Collective Impact The world faces complex, intimidating issues like poverty, victimization and human trafficking. dTERRA Healing Hands\u00ae is dedicated to making a difference. We all wish there were a quick and easy fix to these problems, but solutions only come through dedicated efforts, numerous resources, and extensive cooperation from many different people and organizations\u2014including governments, businesses, and you! This is collective impact. This is what saved Faith. Collective impact is our combined will to make a difference in the world. It focuses on what we can accomplish together, because what we accomplish together adds up to so much more than what each of us can do alone. Collective impact makes progress possible. When we come together to give what we can, we have more than enough to make a real difference. Collective impact is you giving what you can to magnify the combined efforts of the team, working to accomplish the greater good. Everyone gives a little because one person shouldn't have to give it all. Collective impact is deciding to educate, advocate, donate, or fundraise. If we all lift where we stand, we can carry the heaviest burdens. Your Part Beyond dTERRA Hope\u00ae Touch Educate Human slavery isn't a history lesson. Right now, women, children, and men are trafficked\u2014forced or manipulated into service\u2014for work or prostitution. An estimated 40.3 million people (about twice the population of New York and more than the entire population of Canada) are currently enslaved worldwide. By educating yourself on signs of human trafficking, you can help prevent modern slavery and exploitation before it begins. To start your journey, visit https:/ / doterrahealinghands.org/hope. Or you can take a survivor-led education training from the comfort of home: Home | OnWatch (iamonwatch.org). Advocate By raising your voice, you can foster awareness on human trafficking and victimization in your community. Advocate for hope by sharing what you learned from the OnWatch training or share a video (https:/ /doterrahealinghands.org/hope/hope- impact-videos) about trafficking and victimization on social media to encourage others to get involved. The more eyes we have looking for warning signs, the more likely we are to prevent trafficking and victimization before it occurs. Donate Whatever is donated to the dTERRA Healing Hands Foundation is given directly to the causes, as dTERRA covers all administrative and operational costs. This means every cent of your donation helps prevent, rescue, and restore survivors' freedom to hope. It costs about $5,000 to rescue one survivor from human trafficking, but that's only part of the story. One day of aftercare support for a single survivor costs $40. Training a teacher to instruct students on how to protect themselves from trafficking and exploitation is $20. And $5 can train a child to keep himself or herself safe. No matter what you give, every bit helps. Fundraise You can be part of the solution by hosting a Match Program project. Double the fundraising impact for a project that matters to you. Whether it's self- defense courses, prevention training programs, law enforcement task force equipment, survivor aftercare, or another cause you're passionate about, the dTERRA Healing Hands Foundation wants to help you make a difference. We'll match the funds you raise for qualified projects to magnify your impact. Visit the Match Program at doterrahealinghands.org for more information or to get your project started. You have so many ways to contribute to collective impact. Whatever and whenever you donate\u2014whether it's time, skills, or funds\u2014you make a difference.

That's where dTERRA Healing Hands comes in. dTERRA has established itself as a trusted company that provides pure products. Instead of cutting corners to earn easy money, dTERRA has demonstrated commitment to working ethically around the world and providing only the best natural solutions. dTERRA Healing Hands builds on this foundation of trust to accomplish altruistic goals globally. As a nonprofit organization, dTERRA Healing Hands works with businesses, governments, and other nonprofits to enact change on a grander scale. When Faith was 17\u2014after four years of captivity and abuse\u2014she courageously rebelled against the threats and manipulations of her traffickers and escaped. With assistance from a man she barely knew, she made it to a police station. Faith says, \"That man saved my life.\" Officers helped her find a safe place to stay, legal counsel, and other necessary support.Faith's healing journey has been long and difficult. But when individuals and organizations all work together, they can combine their resources and expertise to accomplish so much more. Earlier this year, Faith saw justice served: the five men who trafficked her were sentenced to several decades in prison. She also found critical aid when she joined the dTERRA\u00ae family as an employee. She's now an Advocate of Hope, guiding other survivors to Dahlia's Hope aftercare facility, which came into being because of her story and her desire to help other survivors. dTERRA Healing Hands proudly supports the facility and Faith's advocacy. The Biggest Impact By contributing what we can, we become part of something bigger. Our time, efforts, and talents build on each other into something so much more. When you think about it, collective impact is another gift of the earth. It's the gift each of us can give to create a better world. dTERRA Healing Hands Foundation\u00ae for a Better World The brand-new dTERRA Hope\u00ae Touch Uplifting Blend now includes our exclusive Jasmine essential oil to promote a soothing atmosphere.

Y ou're not alone. Of the people who make New Y ear's resolutions, 80 percent fail to keep them past January . And just 8 percent keep them for the entire year. Set Specific Goals The first step toward achieving your goals is writing them down, with being specific coming in a close second. While ambiguous goals like \"improve my health\" or \"use essential oils more often\" are good, they won't be effective because they lack sufficient details to measure them. So set goals with concrete action plans, clear milestones, and definitive ends. Kick off your goal makeover by placing one drop of Wild Orange, Peppermint, and Frankincense in your hand. Rub your hands together and inhale deeply for an energizing aroma. Now, select one of your vague goals and give it specific, measurable subgoals with deadlines. Subgoals should be challenging but not impossible, with progressively stretching goals to inch you closer to your overall goal. For example, \"improve my health\" could become subgoals as simple as: \"Walk 20 minutes daily for three months.\" \"Drink 45 ounces of water before lunch.\" \"Take the dTERRA Lifelong Vitality Pack\u00ae with dinner every day.\" \"Eat one cup of veggies a day for three months.\" Subgoal deadlines provide you with the opportunity to increase your challenge and maintain your focus. So \"walk 20 minutes daily for three months\" could become \"walk 15 minutes and jog 5 daily, and then stretch with a Deep Blue\u00ae Rub massage.\" By establishing and sticking to deadlines, you increase urgency and commit to a pattern of improvement. Become Inspired This may be the first time you've considered creating a vision board, but inspiration for them dates as far back as the cave men. Anthropologists believe cave paintings were used to visualize an upcoming event, such as a hunt. Let's look at more recent evidence. A 2016 study found one in five small business owners started their business while using a vision board. Of those, 76 percent said their business is right where they planned it to be. Even more remarkable is 82 percent of them noted that more than half of their goals were accomplished by the time of the report. With your well-thought-out goals ready, it's time to create your own cave painting! A vision board is a space dedicated to concrete representations of your aspirations, motivating you to achieve them. It could be a corkboard on your office wall, a poster board on the inside of your closet door, or a portion of the wall sectioned off with painter's tape. Once you've chosen a spot, create a vision board that matches your personality . Use your list of goals to select representations for each. These representations might be pictures, clippings from a magazine, charms, or simple text. Here are a few ideas! \"Buy a house in one year.\"\u2014A picture of your dream house \"Improve my sleep routine.\"\u2014An image of Jasmine being diffused by a bed \"Drink 64 ounces of water daily.\"\u2014A cute sticker of a water bottle \"Use Frankincense essential oil in my skincare in three months.\"\u2014A picture of someone crossing the finish line with your face pasted over the personIt's time to ditch the ineffective resolutions and work on year-round goals that work for you!

It's worthless unless you use it. A morning habit of successful individuals is self-reflection. Set aside time each morning to diffuse dTERRA Passion\u00ae or dTERRA Motivate\u00ae for an uplifting, motivating atmosphere as you contemplate your vision board. Consider action points for the day. Then take five minutes at night to review your progress. As you achieve each subgoal or overall goal, redesign your vision board so it stays relevant to your current plan. Be creative!

What Are Essential Oils? The Power of the Entire Earth in One Bottle On the 196,900,000 square miles of the earth's surface, scientists estimate there are 390,000 plants\u2014with new species being discovered regularly. Unseen by the naked eye, essential oils hide in the seeds, stems, roots, barks, flowers, needles, and fruits of plants. Essential oils are typically found in microscopic, specialized glands within certain plants. Scientifically speaking, essential oils are small organic molecules that quickly change from a liquid to a gas at room temperature. That's what makes bottled essential oils so powerful. Your bottle contains tiny molecules in a liquid state. When you unscrew the cap and open it, the molecules change swiftly from a liquid to a gas, which is why you can smell the essential oil immediately\u2014even from a distance. Natural Solutions for Modern Problems Essential oils have become increasingly popular and commonplace recently. However, their use dates back to ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, among other places. Essential oils aren't just a fad or new trend. They're powerful plant extracts that can be used to promote well-being\u2014just as they have for centuries. Today, millions of people have made essential oils part of their homes because these gifts of the earth provide a natural way to make everyday life easier.CPTG\u00ae CPTG Certified Pure Tested Grade\u00ae Previously in the world of essential oils, no set standard of quality existed, allowing many companies to cut corners on purity. So we made our own standard: CPTG Certified Pure Tested Grade. We diligently work with a worldwide network of essential oil chemists, growers, and distillers to select botanicals of the correct species that are grown in ideal environments and harvested at the right times. Once an essential oil is distilled, it must pass a series of rigorous lab tests, layered one on top of the other for a more complete picture\u2014 including gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS). These steps and processes make dTERRA essential oils the purest on the market. Why It Matters Many oils contain fillers, artificial ingredients, contaminants, or chemical residues. These adulterating elements can cause an oil to lose its efficacy and can even be harmful in some cases. When you choose to purchase essential oils, you're looking for natural solutions to support your home and family. The CPTG\u00ae standard ensures when you order from dTERRA, you receive pure, unadulterated essential oils that are safe to use on yourself and your loved ones. You should never have to settle for anything less. 77 Where to Begin Using essential oils is intuitively simple and highly satisfying. However, the many oils available, with their numberless combinations and wellness applications, can be a bit overwhelming to beginners. As a simple first step on your journey with essential oils, we recommend a trio of Lavender, Lemon, and Peppermint. Three of our most popular oils, they will provide you and your family a compelling experience with the life-enhancing properties of essential oils.

Millions of people across the world are passionate about using natural products to protect their families and live a healthy lifestyle. When you adhere to product labels, instructions, and warnings, you can confidently bring essential oils into your home. Essential oils have a long history of safe, effective usage. When you apply a proper amount of pure essential oils, they're absolutely safe for you, your family, and your home. Like anything else you'd bring into your space, essential oils are safe when you adhere to recommended doses and employ them as intended. Application Methods Sensitive Skin Can be used aromatically Can be used with no dilution (neat) T Can be used topically S Dilute for young or sensitive skin (sensitive) I Can be used internally D Dilute before using topically (dilute) Can be used for home careHere are guidelines for safe usage: Labels: Pay attention to any warnings included on essential oil packaging. Areas to avoid: Avoid putting essential oils in the nose, inner ears, and eyes or on broken skin or other sensitive areas. Dilution: To minimize skin sensitivity, dilute essential oils with a carrier oil. The suggested dilution ratio is one drop of essential oil to five drops of carrier oil. Strong essential oils: Always dilute essential oils with a particularly strong chemistry (like Cassia, Cinnamon Bark, Clove, Oregano, and Thyme) before topical application. Sun sensitivity: Avoid direct sunlight or UV rays for at least 12 hours after using certain essential oils on the skin that may pose a risk for skin sensitivity (such as citrus oils). Safe storage: Store essential oils out of reach of children. Keep them away from excessive light or heat. Young children supervision: Always supervise essential oil application with children. Dilute essential oils before applying them to a child's skin.There are three basic essential oil application methods: aromatic, topical, and internal. Essential oils can also be used for home care. Using an essential oil aromatically means experiencing its properties through the air. Aromatic usage typically includes breathing in or inhaling an essential oil, allowing the scent to interact with your senses. Applying an essential oil topically is a safe, effective way to enjoy the benefits it offers the skin. Taking an essential oil internally can be done by directly applying it to the tongue or mouth, filling a Veggie Cap, or adding it to food and beverages. Certain essential oils can be extremely beneficial in the home for daily chores and cleaning. If cleaning and caring for your home with natural, nontoxic ingredients is important to you, then dTERRA essential oils can provide a simple, powerful way to keep your home in order. Look for the following symbols in this guide to help you determine how an essential oil can be used. You'll also notice sensitive skin symbols to help you safely dilute products before applying them topically. 79 * These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
