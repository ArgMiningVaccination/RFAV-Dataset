Although August is officially National Wellness Month, maintaining our well-being is a year-round practice. Surrounding yourself with a tried-and-true arsenal of stress relief products is an easy way to incorporate mindfulness into your daily life. Plus, they'll always be on standby for those particularly overwhelming moments, from auditions to meetings and everything in between. But first, a little more about National Wellness Month. The national event was launched in 2018 by [Live Love Spa](https://livelovespa.com/pages/wellness-month-2023) and was \"born out of the idea that if we are going to do big things in the world\u2014 build our careers, raise a family, further our education, create new ideas, and nurture our bodies \u2014 we need to take care of ourselves,\" according to the company. (Presumably, it's also a little bit of self-care-minded self-promotion.)
