She has been counseling clients on nutrition and fitness for over 20 years. Her mission is to educate others on achieving optimal wellness through balanced eating, intrinsic coaching, and exercise. Deborah works closely with a gynecologist, Dr. Prudence Hall, who specializes in Integrative Medicine. With Dr. Hall's patients, Deborah uses her knowledge of nutrition and exercise in conjunction with various mind-body medicine techniques to help these patients generate successful and meaningful life changes. In addition to her professional work within the integrative medicine clinic, Deborah is the author of The 200 SuperFoods That Will Save Your Life, published by McGraw-Hill, Inc. This book details Deborah's \"Livit\" philosophy to achieve one's wellness goals. Her past career experiences include hosting a TV show in Georgia on Midday News Live, teaching \"5 A Day - For Better Health,\" working for CNN, Food & Health News, Kirstie Alley's Organic Liaison as a Health Director, and being honored as \"Registered Dietitian of the Year\" by the Spectrum Health Club in Los Angeles..She was also named \"Young Dietitian of the Year,\" by the American Dietetics Association and served as President of the Los Angeles Dietetics Association. Deborah is now on a journey to complete her dissertation research for Saybrook's doctorate in mind-body medicine. For her dissertation, she will conduct a multiple case study, interviewing individuals who have successfully maintained their weight loss goals. Her objective is to identify lifestyle changes and other factors that support long-term weight loss success. It is common knowledge that many people fail in their endeavors for weight loss. The majority who undertake a weight loss regimen, fully gain their weight back after the first six months of a diet regimen. Rather than studying failed cases, Deborah seeks to understand what is special about those who achieve and maintain weight loss. She is passionate about ending the obesity disease and helping others live longer and healthier lives. Her next published book will include her dissertation findings, and will be titled \"Good-bye Diet, Hello Livit!\" For more information on Deborah and her work, visit her video blog channel "}
