These degrees generally require 60 credits across two years of full-time study. However, some schools offer accelerated formats for students who wish to earn their degree in a shorter time frame. Schools can offer these programs in traditional, hybrid, or online formats. An online program can fit a busy learner's schedule and provide the flexibility needed for students with career or family obligations. Hybrid courses mix online and in-person learning, while on-campus programs give a traditional college learning experience. The format does not determine a program's quality, so students should seek the format that best fits their lifestyle. Public health's interdisciplinary nature can lead to significant differences among programs' curricula, so students should find coursework that matches their employment goals. Many associate degrees also focus on developing universal soft skills such as leadership and program planning. The Admissions Process Most schools accept digital applications through their website. Students may pay an application fee. Applications usually require prospective learners to hold a high school diploma or GED certificate. Some public health departments require additional materials like a resume or statement of purpose. Colleges can also set minimum GPAs or test scores for entry, and this data may also determine course placement.
