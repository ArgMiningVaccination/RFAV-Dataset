Posted final reports are located on the Effective Health Care Program search page . iii Preface The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), through its Evidence -based Practice Centers (EPCs), sponsors the development of evidence reports and technology assessments to assist public - and private -sector organizations in their efforts to improv e the quality of healthcare in the United States. The reports and assessments provide organizations with comprehensive, evidence -based information on common medical conditions and new healthcare technologies and strategies. They also identify research gap s in the selected scientific area, identify methodological and scientific weaknesses, suggest research needs, and move the field forward through an unbiased, evidence -based assessment of the available literature. The EPCs systematically review the relevant scientific literature on topics assigned to them by AHRQ and conduct additional analyses when appropriate prior to developing their reports and assessments. To bring the broadest range of experts into the development of evidence reports and health technology assessments, AHRQ encourages the EPCs to form partnerships and enter into collaborations with other medical and research organizations. The EPCs work with these partner organizations to ensure that the evidence reports and technology assessments they produce will become building blocks for healthcare quality improvement projects throughout the Nation. The reports undergo peer review and public comment prior to their release as a final report. AHRQ expects that the EPC evidence reports and technology assessments, when appropriate, will inform individual health plans, providers, and purchasers as well as the healthcare system as a whole by providing important information to help improve healthcare quality.

To conduct a systematic review of the literature on the safety of vaccines recommended for routine immunization in the U nited S tates, updating the 2014 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) report on the topic. Data sources. We searched MEDLINE\u00ae, Embase\u00ae, CINAHL\u00ae, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and Scopus through November 9, 2020, building on the prior 2014 report ; reviewed existing reviews, trial registries , and supplemental material submitted to AHRQ ; and consulted with experts. Review methods. This report addressed three K ey Q uestions (KQs) on the safety of vaccines currently in use in the United States and included in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) recommen ded immunization schedule s for adults (KQ1) , children and adolescents (KQ2) , and pregnant women (KQ3) . The systematic review was supported by a Technical E xpert P anel that identified key adverse events of particular concern. Two reviewers independently screened publications ; data w ere extrac ted by an experienced subject matter expert . Studies of vaccines that used a comparator and reported the presence or absence of adverse events were eli gible . We documented observed rates and assessed the relative risk s for key adverse events . We assessed the strength of evidence ( SoE) across the existing findings from the prior 2014 report and the new evidence from this update . The systematic review is registered in PROSPERO ( CRD42020180089) . Results. A large body of evidence is available to evaluate adverse events following vaccination. Of 56,608 reviewed citations, 189 studies met inclus ion criteria for th is update , adding to data in the prior 2014 report , for a total of 3 38 included studies reported in 518 publications . Regarding vaccines recommended for adults (KQ1) , we found either no new evidence of increased risk for key adverse events with varied SoE or insufficient evidence in this update , including for newer vaccines such as recombinant influenza vaccine, adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine, and recombinant adjuvanted zoster vaccine . The prior 2014 report noted a signal for anaphylaxis for hepatitis B vaccines in adults with yeast allergy and for t etanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccines. Regarding vaccines recommended for children and adolescents (KQ2), we found either no new evidence of increased risk for key adverse events with varied SoE or insufficient evidence , including for newer vaccines such as 9-valent human papillomavirus vaccine and meningococcal B vaccine. T he prior 2014 report noted signals for rare adverse event s\u2014such as . Regarding vaccines recommended for pregnant women (KQ3) , we found no evidence of increased risk for key adverse events with varied SoE among either pregnant women or their viii infants following administration of tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine s during pregnancy. Conclusion. Across this large body of research, we found no new evidence of increased risk since the prior 2014 report for key adverse events following administration of vaccines that are routinely recommended. Signals from the prior report remain unchanged for rare adverse events, which include anaphylaxis in adults and children, and febrile seizures and idiopa thic thrombocytopenic purpura in children. There is no evidence of increased risk of adverse events for vaccines currently recommended in pregnant women. There remains insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about some rare potential adverse events. ix Contents E vidence Summary .................................................................................................................

Evidence Tables ES-1 Evidence Summary Main Points Since the prior 2014 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) report on vaccine safety , we found no new evidence of increased risk for key adverse events following administration of vaccines that are routinely recommended for adults, children,and pregnant women. Signals from the prior report remain unchanged for adverse events that include anaphylaxis in adults and children, and febrile seizures and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in children. There continues to be no evidence of increased risk of adverse events for vaccines currently recommended in pregnant women. There remains insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about some rare potentialadverse events. Background and Purpose Considered one of the greatest public health achievements, vaccines are effective in controlling the spread of and even eradicating a variety of infectious diseases. In 2014, AHRQ developed a report based on a syste matic review o f vaccine safety 1 building upon the 2011 Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) consensus report Adverse Effects of Vaccines: Evidence and Causality .2 Since the 2014 AHRQ report,1 the routine immunization schedule has continued to evolve, with the inclusion of newly approved vaccines and modified indications and schedules for several existing vaccines. This update of the 2014 AHRQ repor t was commissioned by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health's Office of Infectious Disease and HIV/AIDS Policy (OASH/OIDP) . The scope of this systematic review of the evidence wa s to assess the safety of vaccines in the immunization schedule rec ommended for children and adolescents (hereafter , we refer to children and adolescents simply as \"children\"), adults, and pregnant women. The list of vaccines is based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's (CDC) recommended immunization sched ules 3, 4 and includes only those currently licensed for use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).5 Methods The methods for this report follow ed AHRQ's Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Revi ews for the Evidence -based Practice Center Program.6 The report addressed three Key Q uestions (KQs). Studies evaluating vaccines included in the CDC's routine immunization schedules recommended for adults (KQ1), children (KQ2), and pregnant women (KQ3) were eligible for inclusion if they compared the vaccine to either no vaccine or the prior standard of care. Th e evidence review team was supported by a T echnical Expert P anel (TEP) that comprised a diverse set of relevant stakeholders, including vaccine experts with clinical expertise in key populations , vaccine safety methodologists, and consumers. We searched MEDLINE \u00ae (including TOXLINE), E mbase\u00ae, CINAHL\u00ae, Cochrane CENTRAL (including International Clinical Trials Registry Platform registry), Web of Science, and Scopus through November 9, 2020, building on the prior 2014 report. In addition, we reference -mined existing reviews ; searched the trial registry Clinicaltrials.gov ; reviewed supplemental material submitted to AHRQ following a Federal Register Notice posted regarding ES-2 the availability of a portal for submission of unpublished studie s; and consulted with content experts . With the assistance of the TEP, additional content expert input, and based on published literature, we determined a list of key adverse events a priori to allow synthesis across studies (Appendix A). Two reviewers independently screened citations; data were extr acted by an experienced subject matter exp ert. We included experimental and observational studies with a comparator that reported the presence or absence of adverse events. We documented the observed rates of adverse events and assessed the relative risks between vaccinated and comparator groups . All studies that reported rates of adverse events that could be computed, whether from the prior 2014 report or the current search update, were combined in meta- analyses. When studies could not be combined statistically, we narratively synthesized the findings to inform the strength of evidence ( SoE) assessment and to ensure that the available evidence was considered and integrated. The SoE was assessed based on the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach and the AHRQ Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews.6 We used four criteria to grade the SoE (study limitations, consistency, precision, and reporting bias). We differentiated h igh, moderate , low, and i nsufficient evidence to communicate the confidence in the findings across studies, as follows. High : High confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderate : Moderate confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research may change our confide nce in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Low: Low confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is likely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Insufficient evidence : Evidence either is unavailable due to a lack of studies reporting on the outcomes, or the evidence does not permit a conclusion (e.g., due to conflicting results across studies or methodologic flaws) . The review protocol is posted on the E ffectiv e Health C are website at https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/products/safety- vaccines/protocol . The project was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020180089) .7 Results We identified 189 studies in this update , adding to research studies reviewed in the original 2014 AHRQ report on the topic (which built on findings of a detailed IOM report on vaccine safety published in 2011) .1, 2 In total, 338 studies reported in 518 publications were reviewed across both reports . Key Question 1: Safety of Vaccines in A dults Table A synthesizes the findings across the prior 2014 report and the update for key adverse events following administration of vaccines routinely recommended for adults . Any findings originally from the prior repo rt are noted as such, along with any changes to these findings .

Strengths and Limitations Our review of the literature was extensive and designed to capture available evidence on the presence and absence of adverse events associated with vaccines currently in use in the U nited States for routine immunization . We used a broad search strategy and transparent protocol to minimize the risk of missing relevant studies . We review ed the rates of key adverse events reported in vaccine studies that used a comparator, regardless of whether they could be defin itively attributed to the intervention. Many new studies were randomized clinical trials or based on extensive administrative data sets. While our literature search procedures were extensive, our report also had limitations. Many studies were not designed to assess safety of vaccines and reporting of adverse events varied . Identifying safety data is very challenging, since many publications focus on the clinical effectiveness of an intervention with either no, sparse, incomplete, or non -systematic assessment and/or reporting of safety aspects. Despite pooling data across studies, confidence intervals around risk estimates were often wide due to the rare nature of many of the events of interest. We considered all available data regardless of whether they could be combined statistically in the grading the SoE. Discuss ion This report evaluated adverse events in research studies of vaccines administered to adults, children, and pregnant women. Th e report reviews the evidence and provides the strength of evidence, communicat ing our confidence in the findings . The scope does not include the efficacy or effectiveness of vaccines, nor practice or policy recommendations regarding the administration of the vaccines. This report reviews currently recommended vaccines for routine use, and does not include new vaccines in developm ent or under emergency use authorization, such as vaccines for the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID -19) pandemic . Regarding vaccines recommended for adults (KQ1), in this update we found either no new evidence of increased risk for key adverse events with varied SoE or insufficient evidence, ES-9 including for newer vaccines such as recombinant influenza vaccine, adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine, and recombinant adjuvanted zoster vaccine . The prior 2014 report noted a signal for anaphylaxis for hepatitis B vaccines in adults with yeast allergy and for t etanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccines. Regarding vaccines recommended for children and adolescents (KQ2), we found either no new evidence of increased risk for key adverse events with varied SoE or insufficient evidence, including for newer vaccines such as 9- valent human papillomavirus vaccine and meningococcal B vaccine. The prior 2014 report noted signals for rare adverse events - such as anaphylaxis, i diopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and febrile seizures - with some childhood vaccines . Regarding vaccines recommended for pregnant women (KQ3) , we found no evidence of increased risk for key adverse events with varied SoE among either pregnant women or thei r infants following administration of tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine during pregnancy. Despite the large literature, there remains insufficient evidence for rare potential adverse events for which very large samples would be needed to estimate the risk or to definitively exclude a risk of such adverse events. Careful consideration should be given to research gaps; however, important factors must be taken into account when determining whether studies are warranted, including the sever ity and frequency of the adverse event being studied and the challenges of conducting sufficiently powered studies when investigating rare events. Potential risks of rare adverse events should be weighed against the protective benefits that vaccines provide. Conclusion Across this large body of research, we found no new evidence of increased risk since the prior 2014 report for key adverse events following administration of vaccines that are routinely recommended. Signals from the prior report remain unchanged for rare adverse events that include anaphylaxis in adults and children, and febrile seizures and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in children. There is no evidence of increased risk of adverse events for va ccines currently recommended in pregnant women. There remains insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about some rare potential adverse events. References 1. Maglione MA, Gidengil C, Das L, et al.

In the United States, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees regulatory review and approval of vaccines .16 The clinical evaluation of a vaccine typically consists of three phases. Phase I studies are conducted among a small number of participants , generally approximately 20-80 , to evaluate safety and tolerability and to generate preliminary immunogenicity data . Phase II studies evaluate the immunogenicity of the vaccine and provide initial estimates o f the rates of common adverse events, typically enrolling several hundred participants . Phase III trials , which enroll thousands to tens of thousands of participants, provide individual - and population- based information on a vaccine's safety and efficacy to support licensure. After a vaccine is licensed and recommended for use, multiple systems are in place to ensure ongoing assessments of safety through Phase IV studies .17 These studies include safety surveillance conducted by manufacturers as post -marketing requirements (studies or clinical trials that sponsors are required to conduct under one or more statutes or regulations) or commitments (studies or clinical trials that a sponsor has agreed to conduct, but that are not required by a statute or regulation) to the FDA 18 and the FDA's Post -Licensu re Rapid Immunization Monitoring (PRISM) system (the FDA's national system for monitoring medical products after they are licensed for use) .19-21 Multiple other F ederal databases contribute to surveillance, such as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) (co -managed by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]),22 as well as the Vaccine Safety Datalink23, 24 and Clinical Immun ization Safety Assessment project , which are both managed by the CDC .25, 26 Using these vaccine safety monitoring systems, t he FDA a nd CDC may change the terms of vaccine use based on available safety information.27 In 2014, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health's National Vaccine Program Office (which in 2019 became the Office of Infectious Disease and HIV/AID S Policy [OASH/ OIDP ]) commissioned the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ) to de velop a report on vaccine safety entitled Safety of Vaccines Used for Routine Immunization in the United States .28 The 2014 report was based on a systematic review and built upon the 2011 Institute o f Medicine (IOM; now known as the Nationa l Academ ies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine ) 2 consensus report Adverse Effects of Vaccines: Evidence and Causality.29 Since the 2014 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ) report ,28 the CDC's routine immunization schedule s for children and adults have continued to evolve, with the inclusion of vaccines newly licensed by the FDA and modified indications and schedules for some existing vaccines (Table 1). T hese changes include the introduction of several new influenza vaccines; changes in recommended uses of influenza vaccines;30 replacement of the 2 - and 4- valent human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines with the 9 -valent HPV vaccine (HPV9) , expanded indications for HPV9 to include men and women through 45 years of age ;31 and two new serogroup B meningococcal vaccines for use among adolescents and high -risk populations.32 Vaccines with novel adjuvants, such a s those for the new recombinant zoster vaccine, and the new 2- dose series hepatitis B vaccine with a novel immunostimulatory adjuvant were introduced in 2017.33, 34 In addition to an examination of the research published since the prior report, th e current report include s the new vaccines, formulations, and schedules that have been approved since 2014 (Table 1). Note that the use of br and names in this report is for identification purposes only and does not indicate endorsement by AHRQ or OASH/OIDP . Table 1.

For each population in this report \u2014adults (including adults 65 years of age and older), children, and pregnant women\u2014 several important questions must be considered when evaluating adverse events associated with vaccines. First, what adverse events have been reported with vaccine use, and what is the certainty of the association ? Clinicians, patients, and caregivers want information on the nature and the frequency of potential side effects to help them weigh the benefits of vaccines against potential risks. Another question for stakeholders is the severity of the adverse events, even when events are likely to be very rare. Finally, understanding the risk factors that may be associated with adverse event s (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity, medical comorbidity, concomitant medications, adjuvants) is important for policymakers and clinicians to potentially modify vaccine recommendations as needed. Purpose and Scope of the Systematic Review This report assesses the evidence regarding the safety of vaccines routine ly recommended for adults, children , and pregnant women in the United States by systematic review . The list of included vaccines in this report is based on the CDC's immunization schedules35, 36 and comprises those currently licensed by the FDA.37 See Appendix A for all vaccines that are within the scope of this report . This report does not review the safety of FDA- licensed vaccines that were previously included in the immunization schedules but are no longer recommended or included in current immunization schedules or manufactured for use in the United States, such as the serogroups A, C, W, and Y meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine, 2 -valent or 4- valent human papilloma vaccines, or most trivalent influenza vaccines. This report reviews currently recommended vaccines for routine use, and does not include new vaccines in development or under emergency use authori zation, such as vaccines for the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID -19) pandemic . Finally, the scope of the report does not include the efficacy or effectiveness of vaccines, which must be considered alongside against any risks in decision making about vacci nes. 38 The report does not provide guidance for patients or providers regarding the use of vaccines, nor does it make practice or policy recommendations on the use of vaccines. 6 Methods This section briefly describes the methods used to conduct the evidence review. The methods are described in full in Appendix A. Review Approach The methods for th e evidence review upon which this report is based follow the Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews of the Evidence -based Practice Center (EPC) Program of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) , and reporting fo llows the Preferred Items for Reporting in Systematic Reviews and Meta -Analyses (PRISMA) guideline .39, 40 Throughout the project , the evidence review team was supported by a T echnical E xpert P anel (TEP), a diverse panel of relevant stakeholders that included vaccine experts w ith particular clinical expertise in key populations (children, adults, older adults, and pregnant women), vaccine safety methodologists, and consumers. The TEP members were not responsible for the content of the evidence report, but they provided the revi ew team with important perspectives and advice on key components of the systematic review. This update builds on the prior 2014 AHRQ report, 28 which itself built upon the 2011 Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) consensus report .29 The I OM report assessed the causality between specified adverse events and vaccines, based on both epidemiologic evidence and mechanistic evidence (from animal and individual human case studies) . The prior 2014 report did not search for or include studies on va ccines that were reviewed in the IOM report and published prior to 2011. Similarly, in this update only for vaccines for which there were new indications (or for new vaccines) did we perform targeted search es for research published prior to 2014. We search ed MEDLINE \u00ae (including TOXLINE), E mbase\u00ae, CINAHL\u00ae, Cochrane CENTRAL (including International Clinical Trials Registry Platform registry), Web of Science, and Scopus, through November 9, 2020 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies wi th a comparator, and studies that employ ed a self -control led design. The searches buil t on the literature searches undertaken for the prior 2014 report . In addition, we reference- mined existing systematic reviews and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reports ; screened the trial registry , Clinicaltrials.gov ; reviewed supplemental material submitted to AHRQ (following a Federal Register Notice posted regarding the availability of a portal for submission of unpublished studie s); and c onsulted with content experts . The search strategy was not limited to specific adverse events and is documented in full in Appendix A. The K ey Q uestions were publicly posted on the AHRQ Effective Health Care website (https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/ ) to allow additional input. T he final protocol was posted on the E ffective Health Care website at https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/products/safety- vaccines/protocol and is registered with PROSPERO.41 The draft report has been similarly posted for public comment on the E ffective Health Care website. Key Questions The systematic review w as guided by the following K ey Q uestions and subquestions: 7 Key Question 1: What is the evidence that vaccines included in the immunization schedule recommended for adults in the United States (https://www.cdc.gov /vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/adult.html ) are safe in the short term (within 42 days following immunization) or long term (>42 days after immunization)? a. What adverse events are collected in clinical studies (Phases I -IV) and in observational studies containing a control/comparison group? b. What adverse events are reported in clinical studies (Phases I -IV) and in observational studies containing a control/comparison group? c. What adverse ev ents are associated with these vaccines? 1. For each adverse event associated with a particular vaccine, what is the average severity and frequency ? 2. For adverse events without statistically significant associations with a particular vaccine, what is the rang e of possible effects? 3. For each adverse event associated with a particular vaccine, what are the risk factors for the adverse event (including age, sex, race/ethnicity, genotype, underlying medical condition, whether a vaccine is administered individually or in a combination vaccine product, schedule of vaccine administration, adjuvants, and medications administered concomitantly)? Key Question 2: What is the evidence that vaccines included in the immunization schedules recommended for children and adolesce ntsa in the United States ( https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child - adolescent.html ) are safe in the short term (within 42 days following immunization) or long term (>42 days after immunization)? a. What adverse event s are collected in clinical studies (Phases I -IV) and in observational studies containing a control/comparison group? b. What adverse event s are reported in clinical studies (Phases I -IV) and in observational studies containing a control/comparison group? c. What adverse event s are associated with these vaccines? 1. For each adverse event associated with a particular vaccine, what is the average severity and frequency ? 2.

For each adverse event associated with a particular vaccine, what are the risk factors for the adverse event (including age, sex, race/ethnicity, genotype, underlying medical condition, whether a vaccine is administered individually or in a combination vaccine product, schedule of vaccine administration, adjuvants, and medications administered concomitantly)? Key Question 3: What is the evidence that vaccine s recommended for pregnant women, in the United States are safe in the short term (within 42 days following immunization) or long term (>42 days after immunization) for both the woman and her fetus/infant? a. What adverse event s are collected in clinical studies (Phases I -IV) and in observational studies containing a control/comparison group? b. What adverse event s are reported in clinical studies (Phases I -IV) and in observational studies containing a control/comparison group? c. What adverse event s are associated with these vaccines in pregnant women? 1. For each adverse event associated with a particular vaccine, what is the average severity and frequency? 2. For adverse events without statistically significant associations with a particular vaccine, what is the range of possible effects? 3. For each adverse event associated with a particular vaccine, what are the risk factors for the adverse event (including age, sex, genotype, underlying medical condition, whether the vaccine is administered individually or in a combination vaccine product, the schedule of vaccine administration, adjuvants, and medications administered concomitantly)? d. What adverse events are associated with these vaccines in the fetus/infant? 1. For each adverse event associated with a particular vaccine, what is the average severity and frequency? 2.

For each adverse event associated with a particular vaccine, what are the risk factors for the adverse events (including age, gender, genotype, underlying medical condition, whether vaccine administered individually or in a combination vaccine product, vaccine schedule of administration, adjuvants, medications admi nistered concomitantly)? Of note, we use the term \"pregnant women\" throughout the report, mindful that some individuals who identify as male gender or have other gender identities can be pregnant. No studies of pregnant individuals that met inclusion criteria distinguished between gender and sex; all enrolled participants were identified as female. 9 The K ey Q uestions (KQ s) mirror the KQs of the 2014 report. KQs 1a, 2a, and 3a examined which adverse events were collected, mean ing that the authors stated that they planned to collect them or report them as having been collected . KQs 1b, 2b, and 3b look at the rates or risk estimates for adverse events as actually reported in the study. The synthesis is based on pre - specified outcomes selected with the help of the TEP. The subquestions differentiate events for which a statistically significant effect indicating increased risk was found (KQ1c1, KQ2c1, KQ3c1, KQ3d1) and those for which there was statistically significant effect ( KQ1c2, KQ2c2, KQ3c2, KQ3d2 ). The range of possible effects refers to the strength of association. We review ed all instances in detail where there were more events in the vaccine group than in the comparison group as outlined further in the synthesis section. Analytic Framewor k This re port was limited to a safety assessment and focuses on reported adverse events associated with vaccines ; the effectiveness of vaccines is outside the scope of this re port. The analytic framework (see Figure 1) outlines the populations and corresponding KQ , the interventions (vaccines routinely recommended for use in the United States) , and the outcomes (key adverse events for the population and vaccines) that w ere addressed in the evidence synthesis. The analytic framework indicates patient and vaccine factors that could affect the type, severity, and frequency of adverse events associated with different vaccines in different populations. While we analyze the results of studies that report race or ethnicity as a risk factor for adverse event s in this report, we recognize that race or ethnicity themselves are not risk factor s because they are not biologically distinct entities. R ather , racism and social determinants of health equity are a risk factor that may manifest as differences in outcomes based on race or ethnicity . Figure 1. Analytic framework for safety of vaccines used for routine immunization in the United States Abbreviations: KQ\u2014Key Question 10 Study Selection Studies of vaccines included in the Centers for Disease and Prevention ( CDC's ) routine immunization schedule s that reported presence or absence of adverse events in adults, children, and pregnant women were eligible for inclu sion. To enable true assessments of risk, only studies with a comparator were included. We included comparisons to placebo, unvaccinated groups or time periods , or pre -vaccination status. We also included studies that compared new vaccines to the prior standard of care, meaning the previously available or closest vaccine formulation . Studies were excluded if they were non- English language or were published in abbreviated form (e.g., conference abstracts) . No studies were excluded based on setting, timing of follow -up, or risk of bias. English language studies conducted outside of the United States were included if the vaccines studied were part of the current CDC immunization schedules and the formulations were approved for use in the United States . We included trial records from sources such as the Clinicaltrials.gov database , even in the absence of a corresponding publication, from which we extracted all serious adverse events and all adverse events graded as 3 or higher in severity according to Co mmon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria or described by study authors as severe, as well as deaths. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are documented in Appendix A. Titles and abstracts of studies identified by the searches described in Appendix A as well as those suggested by the TEP or public commenters were screened by two independent members of the research team using DistillerSR , an online data extraction program . Full -text versions were obtained for all studies identified for potential inclusion by either team member. Two reviewers independently screened full text publications; disagreements were resolved through discussion. Publications reporting on the same participants were consolidated into a single record f or analys is. Excluded studies are listed in Appendix B. Data Extraction and Risk of Bias Assessment Study- level and outcome data were extracted for each study using a detailed data extraction form in online software for systematic reviews . Data w ere extra cted by an experienced subject matter expert and were checked by methodologists and literature reviewers for accuracy and consistency across studies. Data extraction followed a specific algorithm detailed in Appendix A. We extracted some adverse events by outcome category (e.g., cardiovascular events) . Because some patients may have experienced multiple events within an outcome category, i f studies listed more than one relevant adverse event in a given outcome category then we selected the most commonly reported adverse event in the category . Given that some studies reported a large number of outcomes, f or each K ey Q uestion and vaccine, we prioritized key adverse events to allow for synthesis across studies; these are included in summary of findings tables to assess the strength of the evidence. These key adverse events were identified a priori with the help of the TEP, with content expert input, and informed by published literature. The selection process and the included key a dverse events are listed in Appendix A. All included studies were assessed for sources of bias that could have influenced the reported results. 42 We used the McHarm scale, a tool for structured critical appraisal of adverse event data reported in research studies, for the assessment. Adverse event assessment an d reporting are often lacking in rigor; thus, we applied critical appraisal criteria assessing two main domains:42, 43 data collection of adverse events and r eporting of adverse events . 11 Study details , findings of all included studies , the risk of bias domains, and the res ults of the risk of bias assessment are documented in Appendix C . All studies included in the prior 2014 report on which this report builds on are documented in detail in Appendix C in the 2014 report.28 The evidence tables (included in Appendix D) report all extracted outcomes in the individual studies, but the strength of evidence (SoE) assessment considered only key adverse events to evaluate the overall safety of the vaccines across studies. We reported on the longest follow -up available for each study to capture all relevant events. Data Synthesis and Analysis Data synthesis and analysis were conducted according to the AHRQ Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews .44 The synthesis is organized by KQ, then by type of vaccine, then by type of adverse event. Summary tables document evidence across studies. The synthesis documents the presence as well as the absence of adverse events. We report the relative frequency and severity of the adverse events and the SoE for the presence or absence of specific adverse events. To answer KQ1a, KQ2a, and KQ3a, we documented the adverse events that have been assessed in the included studies . To address KQ1b, KQ2b, and KQ3b, we document ed the adverse events that were reported in the included studies. To address KQ1c1, KQ2c1, and KQ3c1, where possible, we described the severity of the adverse event s for which there was increased risk across included studies.45 We extracted data using the CTCAE rating system , which includes 26 system categories and five severity grades ranging from 1 ( mild) to 5 (death due to the event ), as describ ed in Appendix A. To address KQ1c2, KQ2c2, and KQ3c2, we document ed how many times the event occurred in a vaccinated group compar ed to a control group, and the range of possible effects based on the confidence interval surrounding the point estimate , where available, across studies . In addition, we characterized the severity and frequency of the events associated with the vaccines w herever the information was available. To address KQ1c3, KQ2c3, and KQ3c3, we document ed potential risk factors for adverse events reported i n included studies ; we had planned to explore subgroups and meta -regressions, but insufficient data were available. We computed the effect size and 95 percent confidence interval (CI) for all individual studies and key adverse event s. In a first step, we calculated the RR of an adverse event comparing a vaccinated group to a control group. Many adverse events of interest are not vaccine -specific, such as allergies and infections, and we first determined whether there are statistically more incidences of these events in the vaccinated group compared to a control group. W here studies did not report sufficient de tail, we reported the metrics authors provided, which ranged from verbal statements of no difference, to p -values, to effect measures such a s odds ratios . For each key adverse event , we combined estimates across studies in random effects meta - analyses usi ng Hartung- Knapp correction of standard errors where appropriate. For studies with zero events in one group, we added a constant to the empty cell to enable computation. We determined the most appropriate meta -analysis model as outlined in Appendix A , given that for many adverse events only a small number of studies was available, studies report ed on rare event s, and several studies report ed zero events. 46-49 12 For the synthesis of whether there is increased risk of adverse events, we reviewed the RR estimates across studies. In addition to the relative effect , we also document ed the actual incidence rates, the sample sizes, and the resulting rates of adverse events in the vaccinated and the control groups for all individual stud ies. All findings of more adverse events in the vaccinated group were reviewed further and described in detail in the narrative synthesis . We also reviewed the risk s reported in individual studies and highlighted all instances where individual studies had reported a statistically significant ris k, both in the summary of findings tables as well as the narrative synthesis . Finally, since many estimates were very imprecise (given the small number of reported events and the small number of samples from which conclusions for the true risk could be estimated) the narrative synthesis also reported observed rates to transparently document the available evidence. The results section describes in detail all new evidence identified since the 2014 report , followed by a synthesis across all available evidence. Grading the Strength of the Body of Evidence The strength of the body of evidence (SoE) was assessed based on the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation ( GRADE ) approach and the AHRQ Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews.50 For each KQ, we selected key adverse events that are documented in summary of findings tables to assess the SoE. The evidence tables in the appendix report all outcomes addressed in the individual studies, but the SoE assessment used the a prior i determined list of adverse events to evaluate the overall safety of the vaccines across studies. We used four criteria to grade the SoE : study limitations, consiste ncy, precision, and reporting bias. The outcomes and criteria for grading the SoE are described in detail in Appendix A. We differentiated high, mo derate , low, and insufficient evidence to communicate the confidence in the summary estimates for the finding s across studies. Briefly, high indicates h igh confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect , moderate indicates moderate confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Low indicates low confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Insufficient indicates that evidence either is unavailable due to a lack of studies reporting on the outcomes, or the evidence does not permit a conclusion (e.g., due to conflicting results across s tudies or methodologic flaws). The summary of findings tables document the results across studies grouped by vaccines. For each key adverse event , we report the RR and CI , where available, of the adverse event among those who receiv ed the vaccine of interest compared to control s who did not receive the vaccine . The summary of findings tables include the relative effect across studies as well as the absolute rate of adverse events\u2014 number of events and assessed participants in the vaccine and control groups \u2014reported in the individual studies . In addition, the summary of findings tables summarize any other studies that could contribute to the SoE but that could not be combined into the pooled risk estimates. We integrated data for vaccines still in use from stu dies identified in the 2014 report for which we could calculate the RR of an adverse event comparing a vaccinated group to a control group . In addition, we assessed all findings for which there was a graded SoE in the prior 2014 report and integrated any new evidence. T he summary of findings tables document the reasons for downgrading the SoE where applicable ; and the findings for the outcom es of interest together with a grading of the SoE. The summary of findings tables are followed by summary tables comparing the evidence identified in the 2014 report and the update, followed by a synthesis of SoE and findings . 13 Results This chapter summa rizes the results across studies included in th e systematic review. For each K ey Q uestion (KQ) , we list key points , summarize the update findings, and synthesize strength of evidence ( SoE) across all available data. Appendix B list s excluded studies and the reasons for exclusion. Appendix C details the literature search results and included studies. The evidence table of included studies is provid ed in Appendix D. Description of Included Evidence This update identified 189 studies reported in 338 publications.51-388 Studies were identified through database and grey literature searches, public comments, and reference mining of relevant systematic reviews and package inserts. 2, 3, 5-7, 13-15, 18, 19, 21, 23, 25, 26, 28- 30, 32-37, 389-906 As search filters for adverse events are often insufficient, w e used a broad search strategy and screened 56,608 citations for this report. Of these, 7,573 publications were reviewed in detail as full text (Figure 2) . 14 Figure 2. Literature flow diagram In total, 338 studies reported in 518 publications across both reports met inclusion criteria.51- 388, 907-1086 The most common reason for exclusion was the intervention type (n=1,724 ); some studies were excluded because they were included in the 2011 Institute of Medicine (IOM ) report or were published prior to IOM report for vaccines included in that report (n=164). The most frequent study designs identified in the update w ere randomized controlled trials ( RCT s) (n=104), followed by ( n=15), case -control designs (n=12), and one non-randomized controlled clinical trial, along with 17 others that used self- control led designs (either self-controlled risk interval or self-controlled case series analyses; two of these used self -control led designs in conjunction with a cohort approach) . Studies reported on a variety of datasets, ranging in size from fewer than 50 to millions of data points (Figure 3 ). 15 Figure 3. Range and frequency of sample sizes across studies The number of studies for each vac cine is listed in Figure 4. Figure 4. Number of studies evaluated for vaccines identified in this update Note s: Data given for the report update at the time of the draft report. aIIV\u2014Adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine; D TaP\u2014 Diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine ; HepA\u2014Hepatitis A vaccine ; HepB \u2014Hepatitis B vaccine ; HepA -HepB \u2014 Hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine; Hib Haemophilus influenzae type LAIV\u2014Li ve attenuated influenza vaccine vaccine RIV \u2014Recombinant i nfluenza vaccine ; RV \u2014 Rotavirus vaccine ; Td\u2014Tetanus, diphtheria vaccine ; Tdap \u2014Tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine; VAR \u2014 Varicella vaccine. Studies m ost frequently evaluated influenza vaccines and rotavirus vaccines. Post - vaccination f ollow -up periods varied (Figure 5 ). A large number of studies followed patients for 6 months to record emerging adverse events , and some studies reported data of up to 15 years for 16 some of the included study participants. Of all studies that reported a follow -up period, 23 percent reported on ly on events occurring 42 days or less from vaccine administration. Figure 5. Length of followup in included studies The methodological quality and the reporting of the adverse events varied widely across studies over 15 assessed critical appraisal domains based on the McHarm tool (Figure 6). Details regarding t hese domains and their results are documented in more detail in Appendix C . Most studies reported the timing and frequency of the adverse events assessment , but only a few studies reported on the training and background of the outcome assessors. 17 Figure 6. Critical appraisal of included studies In the remainder of this chapter, we describe the results stratified by population ( KQ1 addresses adult populations; KQ2 addresses children as well as evidence from studies that included both children and adults; and KQ3 focuses on pregnant women and their offspring, specifically) . Within populations, we stratify by vaccine . We focus on the synthesis of findings across studies; m ore information on individual studies is reported in Appendix C. We summarize results for key adverse event s selected with the help of content experts and other findings. Results for all other outcomes are shown in the evidence tables stratified by population in Appendix D. All included studies report on the presence or absence of at least one adverse event, but the number of adverse events varies across studies, and a small number of studies assess several hundred adverse events. Many of the findin gs we describe are from RCTs , of which s ome were placebo -controlled (or in which both intervention and control groups received the same base treatment, such as other routine vaccines) while others used an active comparator . We note the comparator for each study directly in the results section, as well as in the evidence tables in Appendix D . This chapter provide s responses to each of the KQs . The responses are divided into subquestions that are parallel across each K Q, as follows . KQ1a, 2a, and 3a describe the spectrum of types of adverse events collected across all the included studies, and KQ1b, 2b, and 3b identify the specific adverse events reported for each vaccine. KQ1c, 2c, 3c, and 3d are further divided into three subquestions. In KQ1c1, 2c1, 3c1, and 3d1, we examine the average severity and frequency of adverse events for which statistically significant associations were observed with a specific vaccine; KQ3c1 includes reports of associations that involve the pregnant woman, and KQ 3d1 reports on associations that involve the fetus or infant. In KQ1c2, 2c2, 3c2, and 3d2, we assess the range of apparent associations between a vaccine and a specific type of event , including where the relative risk (RR) did not favor the intervention (m eaning the RR was >1) but that did not reach statistical significance given that some of the adverse events are rare. In KQ1c3 , 2c3, 3c3, and 3d3 we describe the risk factors for adverse events. At the end of each K ey Q uestion section, the summary of findi ngs is presented. 18 Key Question 1: What is the evidence that vaccines included in the immunization schedule recommended for adults are safe in the short term or long term? This section describes the evidence for the safety of vaccines routinely recommended for use in adults. Key Points Hepatitis B vaccines: No evidence of increased riskb of diabetes or multiple sclerosis onset or exacerbation (moderate SoE) both remain unchanged from prior report . Anaphylaxis in patients allergic to yeast (moderate SoE) also remains unchanged from prior report. No evidence of increased risk of asthma, autoimmune disease, cardiovascular events, death, diabetes, herpes zoster, reproductive system events, or stroke associat ed with the new hepatitis B vaccine with a novel imm unostimulatory adjuvant ( low SoE) . Quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines: N o evidence of increased risk of asthma, cardiovascular events, death, myocardial infarction, reproductive system events, seizures, or stroke (low SoE). Adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine ( trivalent or quadrivalent): N o evidence of increased risk of asthma, autoimmune disease, cardiovascular events, death, encephalitis/encephalopathy, all low SoE except for cardiovascular events and stroke, which w ere moderate SoE ). Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine: N o evidence of increased risk of cardiovascular events, death, encephalitis /encephalopathy, myocardial infarction, reproductive Measles, mumps, rubella vaccine: No evidence of increased risk of type 1 diabetes mellitus (moderate SoE) remains unchanged from prior report. Serogroups A, C, W , and Y meningococcal vaccines: N o evidence of increased risk of cardiovascular events, death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (low SoE except for moderate SoE) . 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine: N o evidence of increased risk of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, anaphylaxis or systemic allergic reactions, asthma, autoimmune disease, cardiovascular moderate SoE) . 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine: N o evidence of increased risk of death (moderate SoE). No evidence of increased risk of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events in adults ( high SoE). Tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis and tetanus and diphtheria vaccines: Anaphylaxis to tetanus toxoid (high SoE) remains unchanged from prior report. b \"No evidence of increased risk\" indicates that the outcome was studied and that the findings of the studies did not constitute evidence of increased risk of the adverse event following administration of that vaccine (because the risk either was not statistically significantly increased or was reduced) . 19 Recombinant zoster vaccine: N o evidence of increased risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, anaphylaxis or systemic allergic reaction, asthma, cardiovascular events, death, diabetes, seizures, or stroke (moderate or high SoE). No evidence of increased risk of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, angioedema, ataxia, autoimmune disease, or autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease) ( low SoE ). Insufficient evidence to permit evidence statements for the following vaccine s in adults : hepatitis A vaccine, combination hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine, 9 -valent human papillomavirus vaccine, live attenuated influenza vaccine, serogroup B meningococcal vaccine, and varicella vaccine. KQ1a. What adverse events are collected in clinical studies and in observational studies containing a control/comparison group? The information on the data collection for vaccines in adults comes from trial re cords, published protocols, and all published papers available for an individual study. The information was collected from experimental and observational studies. The number and reporting detail of collected adverse events varied widely, and studies often assessed general, non -specific adverse events, such as hospitalizations, along with specific adverse events, such as Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Some studies assessed dozens of adverse events, while others assessed several hundred. The table in Appendix C lis ts the adverse events collected in the included studies by vaccine to document the presence and the absence of adverse events. The table lists all assessed adverse events for a vaccine group (e.g., HepA ) in alphabetical order. The methods used to collect and assess adverse events are summarized for each study in the evidence tables in Appendix D. The risk of bias table in Appendix C documents the methods used to ascertain and report adverse events. KQ1b. What adverse events are reported in clinical studies and in observational studies containing a control/comparison group? The evide nce tables in Appendix D contain all serious and severe adverse events reported in studies of adults . KQ1c. What adverse events are associated with these vaccines? This section further characterizes the risk of adverse events identified in studies of adults who received routinely recommended vaccines. KQ1c1. For each adverse event associated with a particular vaccine, what is the average severity and frequency? The prior 2014 report found several associations, which are detailed in that report and summariz ed at the end of this K Q section in tables that integrate the findings from both reports. Several of these associations were in trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine ( IIV) or monovalent H1N1 influenza vaccine that are no longer in use because they have been replaced by quadrivalent influenza vaccines. For those vaccines that are still in use, the associations between adverse events and specific vaccines established in the prior 2014 report and/or Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) report remain unchanged because there were no new studies or the outcome was 20 not considered a key adverse event (in the case of transient arthralgia). These include anaphylaxis in patients allergic to yeast for hepatitis B vaccines ( HepB; moderate SoE), transient arthra ; anaphylaxis to tetanus toxoid for tetanus toxoid- containing vaccine s (high SoE). We did not find any new association s between any of the studied vaccines and the key adverse eve nts, including for new vaccines not reviewed in the prior 2014 report . For all events, the severity for each event is documented in the evidence table in Appendix D. KQ1c2. For adverse events without statistically significant associations with a particular vaccine, what is the range of possible effects? We summarize the range of possible effects by vaccine below for all adverse events for which the primary relative risk estimate did not favor the intervention (i.e., RR>1) , but the association w as not statistically significant. We also note any instances where an individual study contributing to a pooled risk estimate indicated a statistically significant increased risk of an adverse event. Throughout this section, where possible , we describe caveats t o contextualize the finding, such as noting the confidence interval (e.g., many confidence intervals were extremely wide because only a single event was reported in the study or several studies with rare events were combined for meta -analysis) or assessing whether study authors attributed the event t o something other the vaccine (e.g., death due to a motor vehicle accident or drug overdose) . Hepatitis Vaccines Hepatitis A Vaccine We did not identify new studies reporting on hepatitis A vaccine ( HepA) in this update. Hepatitis B Vaccine s We identified five studies99, 100, 132, 134, 151 evaluating HepB in this update . Three RCTs99, 100, 132 compared HepB with a novel immunostimulatory adjuvant Across the three RCTs99, 100, 132 of HepB with novel adjuvant , we found no evidence of increased risk of herpes zoster ( RR 1.95; confidence interval [ CI] 0.45, 8.51), though one RCT99 showed a significantly increased risk ( RR 2.10; CI 1.02, 4.34; 38/5587 vs 9/2781). T he relative risk of cardiovascular events across these same RCTs was 1.55 (CI 0.46, 5.18). Across two of the RCTs, 99, 132 we found no evidence of increas ed risk of myocardial infarction ( RR 2.00; CI 0.00, 41600564). However, was imprecise and with substantial heterogeneity (I2 64%), possibly due to non- of the RCTs.99 We found no evidence of increased risk of death (RR 0.97; 0.04, 23.18), although again one of the RCTs found a non -statistically significant imbalance in deaths ( 25/5587 [0.44%] vs 7/2781 [0.25%]). These events\u2014 and particularly an imbalance in the rate of death and myocardial infarction in one of the RCTs99 though not the other two RCTs \u2014were noted to be of concern to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) .379 For myocardial infarction in particular, the rate remained similar even once cases were adjudicated by experts (0.25% vs 0.0 4%), and when looking more broadly at cardiac disorders (0.9% vs 0.5%), despite baseline risk factors for cardiovascular disease having 21 been balanced across the intervention and control groups. The manufacturer proposed two post - marketing observational sur veillance stud ies of approximately 60,000 people \u2014one assessing herpes zoster and other outcomes and the other acute myocardial infarction specifically \u2014which started in August 2018.1087 According to the manufacturer in a statement1088 released in December 2019, interim results from the acute myocardial i nfarction study suggested no increased risk with the vaccine. Across the three RCTs,99, 100, 132 we found no evidence of increased risk of asthma ( RR 0.83; CI 0.03, 22.31) . We found no evidence of increased risk of autoimmune disease ( RR 0.70; CI 0.15, 3.21) or reproductive system events (RR 0. 21; CI 0.00, 13.46) . Across two of these RCTs,99, 100 we found no evidence of increased risk of stroke (RR 1.27; CI 0.00, 1430); the effect estimate was imprecise and based on two studies reporting 11/ 5587 cases in the vaccine group vs 4/2781 cases in the comparator group in one study and 1/1821 vs 0/607 cases in the other . One of these RCTs99 RR>1 0.22, 17.81). For encephalitis/encephalopathy and meningitis, the risk estimates were imprecise as there w ere only two cases each in the vaccinated group ( 2/5587 vs 0/2781). There were also few cases of seizures, resulting in a wide confidence interval ( 4/5587 vs 1/2781) . Another RCT288 reported no significant difference in medically attended (meaning the subject sought medical attention for the adverse event) grade 3 or 4 adverse events (HEPLISAV - B 23.5%, Engerix- B 22.2%) in people aged 60 to 70 years with dia betes mellitus but the study reported not enough detail for further analyses . No serious adverse events related to vaccines were reported in either group. In one cohort study134 comparing HepB (presumed to be Engerix- B or Recombivax HB as it took place prior to use of HEPLISAV -B) to no vaccine, there was no evidence of increased risk of diabetes ( RR 0.61; CI 0.55, 0.67) . When combined -B to a non- adjuvanted HepB, the risk estimate remained similar (RR 0.61; CI 0.33, 1.11). In the epidemi ological study for HepB (Engerix- B or Recombivax HB),151 vaccination was not associated with increased risk for central nervous system demyelinating syndromes (odds ratio [ OR] 0.8; CI 0. 4, 2.0) , including acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (OR 1.5; CI 0.2, 12.1) and multiple sclerosis (OR 0.4; CI 0.1, 1.9) for up to three years post - vaccination. Combined Hepatitis A -Hepatitis B V accine This update identified two studies62, 63 of HepA -HepB (Twinrix\u00ae), which included both children and adults ; we presumed that only adults received HepA -HepB as the ages were not specified by vaccine. The case- centered analyses compared the vaccination status of each case to vaccination of all matched persons in the study population who received the same type of vaccine with respect to the exposure interval. One case -centered analysis62 showed no evidence of increased ri sk of optic neuritis in the 2 - to 42- day risk interval after HepA -HepB administration (adjusted OR was not estimable). Another case- centered analysis63 detected no association between sudden sensorineural hearing loss and HepA -HepB within one week of vaccine administration (OR 2.39; CI 0.37, 9.14). 9-Valent Human Papillomavirus Vaccine We did not identify studies assessing 9-valent human papillomavirus vaccine ( HPV9 ) in adults in this update. More evidence on adverse events reported for HPV9 in studies of children and adults together is documented in KQ2. 22 Influenza Vaccines We identified 17 studies assessing influenza vaccines currently in use (all quadrivalent, except for trivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine [ aIIV] as it is still in use) in this update . Thirteen studies (reported in 24 publications)60, 66, 77, 103, 110, 118, 119, 145, 185, 204, 216, 218, 232, 259, 262, 264, 296, 329, 330, 360, 362, 368, 373, 374 assessed quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines ( IIV) and four studies (reported in five publications)84, 97, 98, 192, 378 assessed quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines ( RIV) . Studies of IIV included one Quadrivalent\u00ae Flulval Quadrivalent\u00ae, and one study of Afluria Quadrivalent\u00ae.218 We identified six studies103, 110, 180, 185, 204, 232 of aIIV (four of Fluad\u00ae and two of Fluad Quadrivalent\u00ae). In addition, we identified one study71 of quadrivalent attenuated influenza Inactivated Influenza Vaccines (Non-Adjuvanted) Across six studies60, 66, 77, 118, 145, 218 that compared quadrivalent IIV to trivalent IIV, we found no evidence of increased risk of death ( RR 1.03; CI 0.41, 2.59). Of the six studies, two studies reported no deaths in either group; two reported deaths that were explicitly not considered attributable to the vaccine by the study authors; one did not comment on whether deaths were related to the vaccine; and one found that one of the deaths was considered related to the intervention vaccine. Across five studies 60, 77, 145, 216, 218 that compared quadrivalent IIV to triva lent IIV, we found no evidence of increased risk of cardiovascular events ( RR 1.11; CI 0.34, 3.68) CI 0.27, 4.86) . Although the RR was greater than 1, the estimate is not statistically significant. We also note that these studies compare quadrivalent to trivalent IIV; the prior report noted no increased risk of cardiovascular events (in adults aged 65 years and older ; high SoE) when comparing trivalent IIV to a non- active comparator. Across four studies 77, 145, 216, 218 that compared quadrivalent IIV to tr ivalent IIV, we found no evidence of increased risk of stroke (RR 0.87; CI 0.13, 5.89). Across four studies,60, 77, 145, 216 one that compared a quadrivalent cell IIV to trivalent compared quadrivalent IIV to one trivalent IIV, we found no evidence of increased risk of reproductive system events ( RR 0.75; CI 0. 06, 8.76) . Across three studies ,145, 216, 218 each comparing quadrivalent IIV to trivalent IIV, we found no evidence of increased risk of asthma ( RR 0.46; CI 0.01, 24.59). Across two studies ,60, 77 one that compared quadrivalent cell -cultured IIV to trivalent IIV60 to two other trivalent IIVs, we found no evidence of increased risk of seizure (RR 0.17; CI 0.00, 478774) ; the effect estimate was imprecise and based on with few events occurring across the two studies (0/1324 vs 2/673 and 0/1777 vs 1/893) . two trivalent IIVs containing alternate B strains , we found no evidence of increased risk of autoimmune disease (RR 1.49; CI 0.00, 24522910); the effect estimate was again imprecise due to only one event occurring across both studies (0/105 vs 0/105 and 1/1721 vs 0/1728). One study60 found an RR greater than 1 when assessing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (RR 2.02; CI 0.07, 60.19) and meningitis (RR 2.02; CI 0.07, 60.19); the risk estimates are imprecise as only one event each was reported in the vaccinated group ( 1/1324 vs 0/1338). A sensitivity analysis based IIV ( Flucelvax Quadrivalent, assessed in in adults) compared to trivalent cell -based IIV showed no evidence of 23 increased risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (RR 2.02; CI 0.07, 60.19; 1/1324 vs 0/1338), anaphylaxis or systemic allergic reaction (RR 0.51; CI 0.02, 15.05), cardiovascular outcomes (RR 2.53; CI reproductive system events (RR 0.51; CI 0.02, 15.05), seizures (RR 0.13; CI 0.01, 2.81), or death (RR 0.72; CI 0.23, 2.27). A sensitivity analysis of the high- dose quadrivalent IIV for adults aged 65 years and older (Fluzone Quadrivalent High Dose, assessed in one study 77) compared to high- dose trivalent IIV showed no evidence of increased risk of cardiovascular events (RR 0.34; CI 0.06, 2.00), myocardial infarction (RR 0.50; reproductive events (RR 1.01; CI 0.09, 11.07), seizures (RR 0.25; CI 0.01, 7.48), stroke (RR 0.25; CI 0.01, 7.48), or death (RR 0.75; CI 0.13, 4.50). Adjuvanted Inactivated Influenza Vaccine s For all outcomes except for seizures and death, the risk estimates were imprecise because a small number of events were being reported across only two studies (see rates of each event following the risk estimates). Across three studies 103, 110, 232 (one103 that compared quadrivalent aIIV to two strains of trivalent that compared trivalent aIIV to trivalent IIV), there was no evidence of increased risk of seizures ( RR 0.93; CI 0.36, 2.38). Across two studies103, 110 (one103 that compared quadrivalent aIIV to two compared trivalent aIIV with trivalent IIV) there was no evidence of increased risk of death (RR 1.15; CI 0. 09, 14.54). Although the RR was greater than 1, in neither study were any of the deaths attributed to vaccines. Across the same two studies ,103, 110 there was no evidence of increased risk of cardiovascular events (RR 0.47; CI 0.00, 81.39; 1/888 vs 3/888 study185 of trivalent aIIV also showed no increased risk of acute coronary syndrome ( adjusted odds ratio [ aOR] 0.13; 0.03, 0.65) or stroke ( aOR 0.07; CI 0.01, 0.48) . There was also no evidence of increased risk of asthma (RR 0.76; CI 0.00, 232 to two compared trivalent aIIV to trivalent IIV, there was no evidence of increased risk of autoimmune disease ( RR 0.98; CI that compared trivalent aIIV to trivalent IIV, there was no evidence of increased risk of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (RR 0.29; Across the same two studies,110, 232 there was also no evidence of increased risk of idiopathic thrombocytopenic While both s tudies showed more events in the vaccinated group, in the first study110 the investigators did not consider the event to be related to vaccine; the second study232 did not comment on causality. In one active surveillance study180 of Medicare beneficiaries following influenza vaccination that used a self -controlled risk interval analysis, there was an increased risk of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome following trivalent aIIV (OR 3.75; CI 1.01, 13.96) with an attributable risk of 2.5 episodes per million vaccinations. However, when adjusted for multiplicity the result was no longer robust (q=0.15) . One RCT232 found an RR greater than 1 for anaphylaxis ( RR 1.87; CI 0.06, 55.63), but the risk estimate was imprecise due to one event occurring in the aIIV group (1/88449 vs 0/82539) . When analyzed separately, trivalent aIIV and quadrivalent aIIV still showed no evidence of increased risk of any of the 24 above outcomes. One study204 of trivalent aIIV plus PPSV23 versus PPSV23 alone reported no vaccine -related serious adverse events. Quadrivalent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine Across three studies97, 98, 192 of quadrivalent RIV compared with quadrivalent IIV , we found no evidence of increased risk of cardiovascular events ( RR 1.23; CI 0.34, 4.46) . The RR was greater than 1, largely due to one study with four excess events ( 0/335 vs 0/508, 23/4328 vs 19/4344, 2/998 vs 0/332); no risk estimates from individual studies were statistically significant on their own. Across the same three studies, there was no evidence of increased risk of myocardial infarction specifically (RR 1.35; CI 0.08, 22.21) ; the risk estimate was imprecise due to few events occurring across three studies of varying sizes ( 0/335 vs 0/508; 4/4328 vs 3/4344; 2/998 vs 0/332). Across the same three studies, there was no evidence of increased risk of death (RR 0.66; CI 0.10, 4.26). Across two of the studies,97, 98 we found no ev idence of increased risk of encephalitis/ encephalopathy (RR 0.58; CI 0.00, 3294190), or reproductive system events (RR 0.41; CI 0.00, 82495). The risk estimates for both outcomes were imprecise due to few events occurring across each of the two studies (0/ 4328 vs 1/4344 and 0/332 for reproductive system events). Quadrivalent Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine No outcomes were assessed in more than one study of quadrivalent LAIV in adults. In one study 71 comparing quadrival ent LAIV to two different trivalent LAIV, we found no evidence of increased risk of anaphylaxis ( RR 0.25; CI 0.01, 7.43), asthma (RR 0.25; CI 0.01, 7.43), events ( RR 0.12; CI or death (RR 0.50; 0.01, 25.13). Measles, Mumps, and R ubella Vaccine We did not identify studies assessing MMR in adults in this update. Results in children and mixed samples (adults and children) are docume nted in KQ2. Meningococcal Vaccines Meningococcal A, C, W, and Y V accines We identified four studies53, 54, 104, 147 assessing s erogroups A, C, W, and Y meningococcal vaccine (MenACWY) in adults in this update . Studies compared MenACWY -TT versus meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV) ,104, 147 MenACWY- CRM plus typhoid and yellow fever vaccines versus typhoid and yellow fever vaccines alone,53 -HepB No findings were reported for MenACWY in adults in the prior 2014 report. Both studies53, 54 of MenACWY- CRM were performed in adults aged 18 -60 or 18- 64 years of age ; this vaccine is approved through 55 years of age, but the majority of adults in these studies fell within this range. B oth studies104, 147 of MenACWY -TT were performed in adults aged 56 years and older ; this vaccine has no upper limit of age. Across the two studies53, 54 that compared MenACWY- CRM to base treatment received by both the intervention and control groups , we found no evidence of increased risk of death (RR 0.99; CI 0. 00, 60563320). The risk estimate was imprecise due to no events occurring in either study (0/99 vs 0/100 and 0/85 vs 25 0/84). Combining the four MenACWY studies also showed no evidence of increased risk of death ( RR 0.5 3; CI 0.03, 10.33) . In a sensitivity analysis of the newer vaccine, MenACWY- TT, two studies104, 147 that used an existing meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine as the comparator showed no evidence of increased risk of death (RR 0. 33; CI 0.00, 2256832) . In a study of MenACWY -TT compared to MenACWY -CRM,104 there were no systematic difference in cardiovascular events ( RR 0. 25; CI 0.01, 5.59) , myocardial infarction 0.25; CI 5.59), reproductive system events (RR 2.02; CI 0.07, 60.13), or stroke (RR 0.51; CI 0.02, 15.03) . The RR was greater than 1 for reproductive events but was imprecise due to only one event occurring in the study (1/448 vs 0/453). Meningococcal B V accines We did not identify any evaluations of serogroup B meningococcal vaccine ( MenB ) in adults in this update or in the original 2014 report. Pneumococcal Vaccines We identified 31 studies72, 80, 81, 101, 107, 109, 120, 137, 140, 142, 143, 159, 162, 171, 176, 184, 195, 197, 199- 205, 210, 214, 222, 227, 231, 239 assessing pneumococcal vaccine s (13-valent PPSV23 ]). One study935 of PPSV23 from the prior report that examined cardiovascular events and death could be pooled statistically with new studies from the update. 13-Valent Pneumococcal Vaccine PCV13 was not assessed in the prior 2014 report for adults. In the current report, one study assessed PCV13 compared to placebo,72 one assessed P CV13 plus IIV (Fluzone\u00ae in one study, Fluarix\u00ae in two other studies) ver sus trivalent IIV plus placebo,109, 195, 214 and one assessed PCV13 plus Td versus Td alone .203 One large epidemiological study compared individuals vaccinated with P CV13 to individuals who were not vaccinated.231 Twelve studies compared PCV13 to PPSV23 .101, 120, 140, 142, 143, 162, 184, 197, 200, 210, 222, 227 Across four studies,72, 109, 195, 214 we found no evidence of increased risk of cardiovascular events ( RR 0.97; CI 0.58, 1.64) or myocardial infarction specifically (R R 1.76; CI 0.42, 7.39) and this finding remained consistent when we combined these studi es with another two studies120, 184 that used PPSV23 as an active comparator (RR 0.97 for cardiovascular events [CI 0.64, Of the six studies72, 109, 120, 184, 195, 214 that together found an RR greater than 1 for myocardial infarction, all but one of these studies had either no events or one events in the intervention and/or control group ( 1/576 vs 1/414). Across four PCV13 studies ,72, 195, 214, 231 we found no evidence of increased risk of death ( RR 1.85; CI 0.37, 9.31) . We also found no increased risk of death when we combined these studies together with another four studies120, 140, 200, 227 that used active pneumococcal vaccine comparators (RR 1.22; CI 0.40, 3.69), but there was substantial heterogeneity (I2 99%). We note that one study231 in particular had a significantly increased RR of 3.62 ( CI 3.30, 3.96) based on unadjusted rates from the cohort ( 420/5010 vs 46845/2020720), which contributed to the pooled estimate. When the same study adjusted for age, sex, history of pneumococcal disease or pneumonia , and comorbidities, the risk estimate was lower and no longer signific ant (multivariate hazard ratio [mHR] 1.07 [ 0.97- 1.18]). Of the eight studies72, 120, 140, 195, 200, 214, 227, 231 26 that examined the risk of death, four did not comment on whether the deaths could be attributed to the vaccine, one study noted that the one death was not attributable to the vaccine, and three studies reported no deaths. Although the rel ative risk is not statistically significant which precludes conclusions about the risk, increased mortality in conjunction with this vaccine would be surprising given that the PCV13 decreases pneumonia . It is also possible that the studies' time frame s were too short to capture the decreased mortality over the longer term as a result of vaccination. Across three studies ,72, 109, 214 we found no evidence of increased risk of reproductive system events (RR 0.59; CI 0.01, 42.46) ; this was consistent when we included two other studies120, 184 that used PPSV23 as an active comparator (RR 0.71; CI 0.08, 6.42). Across two studies,72, 195 we found no evidence of increased risk of herpes zoster (RR 1.49; CI 0.00, 24855526); the risk estimate was imprecise as it was based on two studies with only one event across the intervention and control groups (0/576 vs 0/575 and 1/42337 vs 0/42255). Across another two studies, 72, 109 we found no evidence of increased risk of stroke (RR 1.12; CI 0.00, 451); the risk estimate was imprecise given that the two studies were of different sizes and one study had no events (0/551 vs 0/560 and 9/42237 vs 8/42255). In one study,72 we found no evidence of autoimmune disease (RR 1.00; CI 0.02, 50.42); of note this risk estimate was imprecise as it was based on one study with no events in either the intervention or control groups (0/42337 vs 0/42255). The finding remained similar when combined with another study 184 that used PPSV23 as an active comparator (RR 0.67; CI 0.00, 11165626). One study72 noted an RR greater than 1 for acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and meningitis following PCV13 (RR 2.00; CI 0.07, 59.64 for both outcomes, due to one event each in the intervention and control groups). Another study 109 noted an RR greater than 1 for enceph alitis (RR 1.02; CI 0.02, 51.13) but neither group had any events of encephalitis. A cohort study222 of over 545,000 people comparing P CV13 to PPSV23 found no evidence of increased risk of pre -specified adverse events with P CV13 compared to PPSV23. However, only anaphylaxis as an adverse event was verified by chart review; out of 9 anaphylaxis events (5 in the PCV13 group and 4 in the PPSV23 group), only one was verified as having occurred after vaccination, in a patient who received four other vaccines concomitantly. The study did not report sufficient detail for further analyses for other adverse events. Regarding ot her outcomes that were not pre -specified key adverse events for the current report , a study 143 of PCV13 versus PPSV23 among individuals with Crohn's disease reporte d no serious adverse events in the PCV13 group compared to two serious adverse events in the PPSV23 group ( infection with e nterococcus faecalis and sinusitis). Adverse events were assessed as unrelated to vaccination. A study 162 of PCV13 compared to PPSV23 among individuals with HIV reporte d no serious adverse events in either group. A small RCT210 of PCV13 versus PPSV23 in adults with leukemia reported no severe adverse events in either group. A small RCT227 of PCV13 versus PPSV23 in hemodialysis patients reported no difference in the risk of developing pneumonia or undergoing a kidney transplant between the two groups. No specific adverse even ts data were reported. Finally, an RCT 101 of PCV13 versus PPSV23 in solid organ transplant recipients showed more s erious adverse events following PCV13 within the first week following vaccination (7/66 among PCV13 recipients compared to 1/66 among PPSV23 recipients), but no events were considered related to vaccination and no vaccine -related allograft rejection was no ted. 27 One study203 reported that no serious adverse events occurred, while three others142, 197, 202 reported that no vaccine -related serious adverse events occurred (though did not specify what other serious adverse events occurred). 23-Valent Pneumococcal Vaccine Seven studies assessed PPSV23 versus placebo or no vaccine,81, 159, 171, 176, 201, 239, 935 two80, 137 assessed PPSV23 plus trivalent IIV (one used Vaxigrip\u00ae, a formulation of IIV not available in US and the other did not specify brand) versus trivalent IIV alone , and one each assessed PPSV23 plus trivalent IIV (a Japanese formulation not available in the US US) versu s quadrivalent IIV and PPSV23 plus trivalent aIIV versus trivalent aIIV alone .204, 205 A small cohort study107 of individuals with a diagnosis of immune -mediated inflammatory disorder under going treatment with high- dose systemic corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive drugs compared those vaccinated with PPSV23 with those not vaccinated against pnuemococcal disease. Across four studies of PPSV23 (two cohort studies239, 935 comparing to vaccinated to unvaccinated patients, one cohort study80 comparing to trivalent IIV a lone, and PPSV23 plus trivalent IIV to trivalent IIV plus placebo), we found no evidence of increased risk of cardiovascular events (RR 0.46; CI 0.27, 0.76). A cohort study176 of people aged 60 years and older in Spain that compared PPSV23 to no vaccine reported no increased risk of no increased risk of myocardial infarction (mHR 0.95; CI 0.76, 1.18) . The same four studies 80, 199, 239, 935 found no evidence of increased risk of death (RR 0.62; CI 0.16, 2.44). A cohort study137 comparing PPSV23 plus trivalent IIV to trivalent IIV alone reported that dual -vaccinees experienced fewer deaths ( hazard ratio [ HR] 0.65; CI 0.55, 0.77) and cases of 0.57; CI 0.51, 0.64), ischemic stroke (HR (HR 0.52; CI 0.38, 0.71) . The study did not provide sufficient detail for further analyses. Another cohort study159 specifically of patients with prostate cancer in Taiwan found that the seven -year overall survival rate was significantly higher in the PPSV23 -vaccinated group than in the unvaccinated group (47.5% vs 42.3%, p=0.0003). Finally, a cohort study176 of pe ople aged 60 years and older in Spain that compared PPSV23 to no vaccine reported no increased risk of death (mHR 0.97; CI 0.89, 1.05) . The same cohort increased risk of myocardial infarction (mHR CI 0.83,1.30) . One cohort study81 no increased risk of stroke (mHR 0.57; CI 0.31, 1.03 for the cohort study). A case- control study201 also found no increased risk of stroke ( aOR 0.94; CI 0.89 to 1.00) but found an increased risk of transient ischemic attacks ( OR 1.16; 1.09, 1.23) . Regarding other outcomes, the cohort study107 of PPSV23 in patients with immune -mediated inflammatory disorder found vaccinated and unvaccinated groups had a similar decrease in disease activity , and the study reported no adverse events. The RCT171 of P PSV23 versus placebo reported an increased risk for extensive arm swelling among participants who received PPSV23 compared t o saline (0.55% vs 0.00%, p<0.001). The remaining RCT s177, 205 reported that no vaccine -related serious adver se events occurred, but did not provide more specific details about specific adverse events . Tetanus, Diphtheria, and A cellular Pertussis Vaccines We identified one study124 that assess ed Tdap in this update . This was an RCT of Tdap (Adacel\u00ae) compared to Td (Tenivac\u00ae) in adults who had received one dose of Tdap 8 to 12 years 28 earlier. There was no evidence of increased risk for autoimmune disease or spontaneous abortion in either group. There were no deaths in either group and no significant differences in serious adverse events overall . Varicella Vaccine We did not identify studies assessing varicella vaccines in studies in adults, in this update or the original report. Results from studies of children and adults together are documented in KQ2. Zoster Vaccine We identified six studies82, 85, 150, 165, 194, 209 that assessed recombinant zoster vaccine ( RZV) (which was not in use at the time of the prior report), all of which were RCTs comparing the vaccine to either placebo or a base treatment also received by the intervention group. One RCT209 compared RZV plus Tdap to Tdap alone, but the control group later also received RZV; thus, we could only include events that occurred after the first visit, which did not include any key adverse events (not discussed further here). Across five studies , 82, 85, 150, 165, 194 we found no evidence of increased risk for herpes zoster occurring as an adverse event after vaccination (RR 0.09; CI 0.02, 0.30) , but there was heterogeneity across studies (I2 58%). Across four studies82, 85, 150, 194 we found no evidence of increased risk of death ( RR 0.9 3; CI 0. 78, 1.11) . Across three studies ,82, 85, 150 we found no evidence of increased risk for card iovascular events (RR 0.89; CI 0. 66, 1.21) or myocardial infarction specifically (RR 0.89; CI 0.38, 2.05) . Many of the estimates across only two studies85, 150 were imprecise given the low numbers of events across the intervention and control groups; we provide the rates as well for these estimates. We found no evidence of increased risk for anaphylaxis (RR 1.32; CI 6/7695 vs 5/7710), autoimmune disease (RR 0.88; CI 0.23, 3.31), diabetes (RR 1 .00; CI system events (RR 1.04; CI 37.17), seizures (RR 1.34; 2/6950 vs 0/6950 and 3/7695 vs 3/7710). For some of the key adverse events, there was a higher rate in the vaccine arm compared to the placebo arm in each of the two studies. For amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (RR 2.6 0; CI 0/6950 and 2/7695 vs , none of the events were considered intervention -related by the investigators. For idiopathic thrombocytopeni and 3/7695 vs 1/7710), investigators blinded to the study arm thought that one case in the vaccine arm and one case in the placebo arm were intervention -related. For stroke (RR 1.44; CI 0.03, 71.52; 7/6950 vs 6/6950 and 19/7695 vs 12/7710) , no events were considered intervention - related in the vaccine arm, and 1 was considered intervention -related in the placebo arm. One RCT 85 identified an RR greater than 1 for angioedema ( RR 2 .00; CI 0.07, 59.61) bas ed on one case among those vaccinated with RZV ( 1/6950 vs 0/ 6950) , resulting in an imprecise risk estimate. 29 KQ1c3. For each adverse event associated with a particular vaccine, what are the risk factors for the adverse event? No adverse events were significantly associated with a vaccine in our meta- analyses, but we discuss any risk factors that were examined for adverse events below. In one RCT85 of R ZV conducted in multiple countries, the investigators performed adverse event analyses by race/ethnicity, gender, and age . Unsolicited adverse event s were least common ly reported by people who are Black, most common ly reported by people who are Asian, more common ly reported by women than by men , and very slightly more commonly reported by people aged 50 to 69 years than by those aged 70 years and older . Four studies identified risk factors for adverse events for PPSV23. A n RCT171 of PPSV23 versus placebo reported an increased risk for extensive arm swelling , which was significantly more likely in women (female 10/1138 vs male 3/1202, p=0.04). Another study165 with RZV to PPSV23 alone . Solicited general adverse events were more frequently reported when the first dose of RZV and PPSV23 were co- administered than when PPSV23 was administered alone. A third study176 that assessed myocardial infarction, stroke, deaths from myocardial infarction or stroke, and deaths from all causes found no increased risk of these outcomes when looking at those with and without history of prior coronary artery disease and those with and without a history of cerebrovascular disease. A fourth study201 looked at risk of stroke following PPSV23, and found no difference in risk of stroke among those who were younger than 65 years compared to those who were 65 years and older. The same study looked at transient ischemic attacks and found an increased risk among those younger than 65 years (aOR 1.61; 1.40, 1.85) but not those 65 years and older (a OR 1.03; 0.96, 1.10) . Three studies162, 222, 231 examined risk factors or sub -groups for adverse events associated with PCV13. One large cohort study231 of over two million people found PCV 13 to be significantly associated with increased r isk of all -cause pneumonia among adults aged 65 years and older (mHR 1.76; CI 1.5, 2.04), immunocompromised persons and immunocompetent person s (mHR 1.86; CI 1.55, 2.25) compared to no vaccination for pneumococcal disease but did not report sufficient detail for further analyses . Among people aged 50 to 64 years, there was no significant difference in all -cause pneumonia if vaccinated (mHR 1.21; CI 0.85, 1.72) . Among all sub- groups , there was no significant association between vaccination and pneumococcal pneumonia or death. These findings are at odds with those from the large, high- quality study72 of PCV13 in older adults, which evaluated 84,496 adults 65 years of age or older . This RCT found that PCV13 was not associated with increased risk , and in fact prevent ed, vaccine -type pneumococcal, bacteremic, and nonbacteremic community- acquired pneumonia and vaccine -type invasive pneumococcal disease, and found no increase d risk of all- cause community -acquired pneumonia . Of note, some of the unvaccinated population in the cohort study was assumed to have potentially received PPSV23, which may have affected the relationship observed as older adults may have been more likely to have received PPSV23. In addition, the cohort study was an observational one that could have had some residual confounding by indication, despite multivariate analyses to adjust for this. Another cohort study 222 of over 545,000 people comparing P CV13 to P PSV23 found no evidence of increased risk of several pre -specified adverse events; however, anaphylaxis was the only adverse event verified by chart review , with only one event confirmed as having occurred after vaccination out of 9 events in total . Stratified analyses by age group (65-69 ye ars, 70 years) were consistent with the findings from the main analysis. Finally, a study162 of pneumococcal va ccine-na\u00efve 30 adults w ith HIV found no serious adverse events associated with PCV13, though they were not compared to adults without HIV . Three studies looked at risk factors for adverse events among recipients of different influenza vaccines. An RCT of quadrivalent IIV (Fluzo ne Quadrivalent, compared to its trivalent counterpart ) found that s olicited systemic reactions were reported more frequently by participants 18 to 60 years of age than by participants 61 years of age or over .118 Another RCT of IIV (Flucelvax Quadrivalent, again compared to its trivalent counterpart ) stratified risk of adverse events by age, sex, and race/ethnicity.60 These subgroup analyses did not show any notable differences in terms of safety . Unsol icited adverse events and medically attended adverse events were reported by somewhat higher percentages in participants 65 y ears of age and older than in those 18 to 64 year s of age, al though rates of possibly vaccine -related adverse events were similar between the two subgroups. Another study was itself a subgroup analysis, examining the administration of PPSV23 with IIV compared to IIV alone .177 There were no safety concerns, except that pain (Grade 3 and up, mean ing more severe) occurred more often with co -administration of the vaccines compared to IIV alone (3.5% vs 0.0%). For quadrivalent aIIV, one RCT103 conducted in the U nited S tates found that rates of any solicited adverse events were higher in the 65 to 74 year age subgroup than in the 75 to 84 year age subgroup across both intervention and comparator arms of the study . No notable differences were observed in the subgroups by gender and race. In an RCT99 of HepB with novel adjuvant (HEPLISAV -B) compared to an existing HepB (Engerix -B), a subgroup analysis288 of adults aged 60 to 70 years with diabetes mellitus found no increase in risk of adverse events when comparing the vaccines. KQ1 : Summary of Findings for Safety of Vaccines in Adults The summary of findings tables document the results across studies grouped by vaccines. These tables show the number of RCTs, the number of other studies, the number of participants across pooled analyses, the studies contributing to the risk estimate, findings for the outcomes of interest, the criteria used to downgrade the SoE, and the SoE summary statement . The relative risk of an adverse event was derived by comparing the reported event rates in vaccinat ed participants compared to a control group across all studies that reported the data for that outcome. T he absolute rates of adverse events (number of events, number of assessed participants) for the vaccine and the control group are also shown . In many i nstances, results were based on single occurrences of a specific adverse event . Where studies reported insufficient detail and did not contribute to the effect size estimates, the tables report t he results as reported by the study authors. Hepatitis Vaccin es Table 2 shows the evidence for key adverse events associated with HepA, HepB, and HepA- HepB vaccines. 31 Table 2.

The prior 2014 report had concluded that there wa s insufficient evidence to make evidence statements regarding an association between HepA and a cute disseminated encephalomyelitis, transverse myelitis, multiple Guillain -Barr\u00e9 inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Bell 's palsy, anaphylaxis, and autoimmune hepatitis across all identified studies (including samples in children) based on a review of the evidence by the IOM, and one additional post -licensure study with no association with adverse events. We identified no new studies evaluating key adverse events since the prior 2014 report. Thus, the evidence remains i nsufficient to draw conclusions about HepA . HepB. The prior 2014 report found moderate SoE for no association with multiple sclerosis onset or exacerbation based on a 2002 IOM report1089 on HepB and dem yelinating disorders (HEPLISAV -B was not in use at that time). This finding remains unchanged for HepB (update identified no new studies except for HEPLISAV -B, for which the SoE was insufficient ). 34 The prior 2014 report also found moderate SoE for no assoc iation of type 1 diabetes mellitus with HepB. Studies identified in the update found no evidence of increased risk of diabetes across all HepB (type of diabetes was not specified) . Thus, a cross the prior 2014 report and t his update, there wa s moderate SoE for no evidence of increased risk of diabetes (including type 1 diabetes mellitus ). The prior 2014 report found moderate SoE supporting a causal relationship between hepatitis B vaccine and anaphylaxis in patients allergic to yeast , which was based on mechanistic evidence from the IOM report ; the estimate of the magnitude of increased risk was not determined . Of note, HEPLISAV -B was not in use at that time. Th is finding remains unchanged (update identified no new studies on anaphylaxis , including for HEPLISAV -B). There wa s also low SoE for no evidence of increased risk for asthma, autoimmune disease, cardiovascular events, death, herpes zoster, reproductive system events, or stroke (all stud ies were of HEPLISAV -B). The prior 2014 report found insufficient evidence for an association between the vaccine and optic neuritis, first demyelinating events in multiple sclerosis, Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome, onset or exacerbation of rheumatoid arthritis because there were no studies. The review of studies from the update found insufficient evidence for key adverse events either because the evidence was graded as i nsufficient or there were no studies. HepA -HepB. In this update, we found no studies examining the key adverse events of interest for HepA -HepB, except for optic neuritis (which was judged as insufficient evidence). The prior 2014 report also did not ident ify any studies. Thus, there was i nsufficient evidence to draw conclusions about HepA -HepB .

Quadrivalent IIV was not reviewed in the 2014 report , only trivalent IIV and monovalent H1N1 influenza vaccine . The prior 2014 report found h igh SoE for anaphylaxis in allergic persons with prior influenza vaccines based on the IOM report for trivalent IIV only. The prior 2014 report also found high SoE for a rthralgia, myalgia, malaise, fever, and pain at the injection site for trivalent IIV . There wa s also high SoE for no association with cardiovascular events in adults aged 65 years and older in the prior 2014 report for trivalent IIV (based on post -licensure studies) . Finally, the prior 2014 report found high SoE that the monovalent H1N1 influenza vaccine was associated with increased risk of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome, but this wa s not examined in the update as the vaccine is no longer in use. There was insufficient evidence to conclude anything regarding influenza vaccines and multiple sclerosis onset and exacerbation in the prior 2014 report. All evidence statements for quadrivalent IIV currently in use co me only from the current report, which identified low SoE for no evidence of increased risk for asthma, cardiovascular events, death, myocardial infarction, reproductive system events, seizures , or stroke for quadrivalent IIV compared to existing vaccines . There was insufficient evidence or no studies for several other key adverse events. aIIV. aIIV (Fluad and Fluad Quadrivalent ) was not in use at time of prior 2014 report ; all evidence statements are based on the current report. The current report found mo derate SoE for no evidence of increased risk of cardiovascular events or stroke. The current report also found low SoE for n o evidence of increased risk for asthma, autoimmune disease , death seizures compared to existing influenza vaccines. There was insufficient evidence to judge the risk of other key adverse events. RIV. Quadrivalent RIV was not in use at the time of prior 2014 report (and trivalent RIV results were combined with all IIV ); all evidence statements are based on the current report. The current report found low SoE for no evidence of increased risk for cardiovascular events, death, encephalitis/ encephalopathy, myocar dial infarction, reproductive system events, or stroke for quadrivalent RIV compared to quadrivalent IIV. For some key adverse events, the evidence was judged to be insufficient or we did not find studies reporting on the outcome. LAIV . We reviewed one study of quadrivalent LAIV in the current report , with insufficient evidence or no studies for key adverse events.

The prior 2014 report found moderate strength evidence supporting a causal relationship between the rubella component of MMR and transient arthralgia in women from the IOM report, which was based on mechanistic evidence ; the estimate of the magnitude of in creased risk was not determined . This finding remains unchanged, as transient arthralgia was no t examined as a key adverse event in the current report. The prior 2014 report found moderate strength evidence of no association of onset 47 of type 1 diabetes and insufficient evidence for Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, onset of multiple sclerosis, chronic arthralgia in women, and chronic arthritis and arthropathy in men. These findings also remain unchanged given that there were no new studies in the update and/or these were not examined as key adverse events.

KQ1: Safety of zoster vaccines in adults Vaccine (Abbreviation; Brand Name[s]) 2014 Report SoE and Findings SoE and Findings in Update Synthesis of S oE and Findings Zoster recombinant, (RZV ; Shingrix) RZV not in use at time of prior report High: No evidence of increased risk of herpes zoster Moderate: No evidence of increased risk of a myotrophic lateral sclerosis, anaphylaxis or systemic allergic reaction , asthma, cardiovascular events , , stroke Low: No evidence of increased risk of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis , angioedema, ataxia, autoimmune disease, autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's transmission of live varicella virus, transverse myeliti s High: No evidence of increased risk of herpes zoster Moderate: No evidence of increased risk of a myotrophic lateral sclerosis , anaphylaxis or systemic allergic reaction , asthma, cardiovascular , stroke Low: No evidence of increased risk of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis , angioedema, ataxia, autoimmune disease, autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease) Key: Green box indicates no evidence of increased risk of specific adverse events ; Note s: KQ \u2014Key Question ; SoE \u2014 Strength of Evidence Key Question 2: What is the evidence that vaccines included in the immunization schedules recommended for children and adolescents are safe in the short term or long term? This section describes the evidence for the safety of vaccines routinely recommended for use in children, including evidence from studies of children and adults together . Key Points Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine : No evidence of increased riskc of asthma or death ( low SoE) . No evidence of increased risk of type 1 diabetes mellitus (moderate SoE) remains unchanged from prior report. Tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis vaccine : No evidence of increased risk of cardiovascular events or death (low SoE) . Hepatitis A vaccine: Increased risk of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in children aged 7 to 17 years (moderate SoE) remains unchanged from prior report. c \"No evidence of increased risk\" indicates that the outcome was studied and that the findings of the studies did not constitute evidence of increased risk of the adverse event following administration of that vaccine (because the risk either was not statistically significantly increased or was reduced) . 61 Hepatitis B vaccine: No evidence of increased risk of multiple sclerosis (moderate SoE) remain s unchanged from prior report. 9-valent human papillomavirus vaccine : No evidence of increased risk of autoimmune disease, birth defects, death, reproductive system events, seizure s, or spontaneous abortion (low SoE) . Quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine: No evidence of increased risk of anaphylaxis or systemic allergic reaction, asthma, autoimmune disease, cardiovascular events, death , febrile seizures, or seizures ( low SoE , except for death which wa s moderate SoE ). Quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine: N o evidence of increased risk of death or seizures (low SoE). Measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine: N o evidence of increased risk of autism (high SoE remains consistent from prior report) . Increased risk of febrile seizures (high SoE ) and idiopathic thrombocytopenia (moderate SoE) remain s unchanged from prior report. Anaphylaxis (high SoE) remains unchanged from prior report. No evidence of increased risk of asthma (low SoE). Serogroup A, C, W, and Y meningococcal vaccines: N o evidence of increased risk of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, asthma, autoimmune disease, c ardiovascular events, death, diabetes, encephalitis/encephalopathy, febrile seizures, c purpura, Kawasaki disease, meningitis , multiple sclerosis, reproductive system events, seizures, or transverse myelitis (low or moderate SoE) . Anaphylaxis in children with allergies remains moderate SoE, but there was no evidence of increased risk among all children (low SoE) based on the update . Serogroup B meningococcal vaccine : No evidence of increased risk of anaphylaxis or systemic allergic reaction , asthma, death, reproductive system events, or seizures ( low or moderate SoE). 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine: N o evidence of increased risk of asthma, cardiovascular events, death, intussusception, meningitis, reproductive system events, or seizures associat ed with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( low SoE except for death, which was moderate SoE ). Increased risk of febrile seizures (low SoE , which was downgraded from moderate from prior report ). Rotavirus vaccine: No evidence of increased risk of intussusception across studies (moderate SoE , which was downgraded from moderate SoE for increased risk from prior report to moderate SoE for no increased risk when combining all available studies ), though some observational studies indicated increased risk. No evidence of increased risk of anaphylaxis or syste mic allergic reaction, asthma, autoimmune disease, autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease), death, diabetes, encephalitis/encephalopathy, febrile seizures, idiopathic thrombocytopeni c purpura, Kawasaki disease, meningitis, events, or stroke vaccine strain viral reactivation without other organ involvement, and vaccine strain viral reactivation with subsequent infection resulting in meningit is or encephalitis (high SoE) all remain unchanged from prior report , as does i diopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in children aged 11 to 17 years (moderate SoE) . Combination vaccines: For D TaP-IPV-Hib-HepB: no evidence of increased risk of asthma, death, febrile seizures , or meningitis (low SoE) . For DTaP- IPV/Hib: n o evidence 62 of increased risk for anaphylaxis or systemic allergic reaction (low SoE). For DTaP- IPV: no evidence of increased risk for encephalitis/encephalopathy (low SoE). Insufficient evidence to permit evidence statements for the following vaccine s in children: Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine DTaP -HepB- IPV. KQ2a. What adverse events are collected in clinical studies and in observational studies containing a control/comparison group? Given the many types of events assessed across studies of vaccines in children , the complete list is shown in Appendix C. We differentiated adverse events collected in studies that included only children and those in studies that included both children and adults. The assessed adverse events include both prespecified and incidentall y collected adverse events. The information comes from a variety of experimental and observational designs. Details of the studies , including the method used to assess adverse events , are documented in the evidence tables (Appendix D) and the risk of bias table (Appendix C). Studies collected information about the presence and absence of a variety of different events encompassing the range of mild and transient events to serious adverse events with permanent consequences. KQ2b. What adverse events are reported in clinical studies and in observational studies containing a control/comparison group? The evidence tables in Appendix D contain all serious and severe adverse events reported in studies of children and studies of children and adults together. KQ2c. What adverse events are associated with these vaccines? This section further characterizes the risk of adverse events identified in studies of children who received routinely recommended vaccines. KQ2c1. For each adverse event associated with a particular vaccine, what is the average severity and frequency? The prior 2014 report found several associations, which are detailed in that report and summarized at the end of this K ey Q uestion section in tables that integrate the findings from both reports. Sever al of these associations were in vaccines that are no longer in use because they have been replaced by newer vaccines, including trivalent IIV and monovalent H1N1 influenza vaccine, and 2 -valent and 4 -valent human papillomavirus vaccines. For those vaccine s that are still in use, the associations between adverse events and specific vaccines established in the prior 2014 report and/or IOM report remain largely unchanged because there were no new studies or the outcome was not considered a key adverse event. These include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura with HepA and MMR (moderate children with allergies with MMR, MenACWY, and varicella vaccine (moderate or high SoE) ; transient arthralgia with MMR (moderate SoE) ; and disseminated varicella zoster virus , vaccine strain viral reactivation without other organ involvement (i.e., herpes zoster) , and vaccine strain viral reactivation with subsequent infection resulting in meningitis or encephalitis with varicella vaccine. In the update , we found new studies of febrile seizures (or seizures that were presumed to be febrile seizures) that did not contradict the increased risk of febrile seizures with MMR found in 63 the prior 2014 report (high SoE) and we downgraded the SoE for f ebrile seizures with PCV13 (from moderate to low SoE); see KQ2c2 and summary of findings tables for more details . We did not find any new statistically significant associations between any of the studied vaccines (including for new vaccines not reviewed i n the prior 2014 report) and the key adverse events. Adverse events that are no longer considered to be associated with a particular vaccine are discussed in KQ2c2. For all events, t he severity for each event is documented in the evidence table in Appendix D. KQ2c2. For adverse event s without statistically significant associations with a particular vaccine, what is the range of possible effects? Although many studies contributed to the analyses, only a small number of studies reported sufficient detail abou t key adverse event s to allow effect size estimates. Below we report all pooled risk estimates for adverse events that were reported on by more than one study. We note any instances where individual studies contributing to a pooled risk estimate were stati stically significant on their own, indicating increased risk of an adverse event. We also report on studies with risk estimates that could not be computed and pooled statistically. Finally, a s for KQ1, we summarize the range of possible effects by vaccine in brief below for all adverse events for which the primary relative risk estimate did not favor the intervention (i.e., RR>1) , but the association was not statistically significant. Where appropriate, we contextualize the finding to understand the range of possible effects. Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Acellular Pertussis Vaccines (D TaP, Tdap) DTaP We identified one RCT,183 one pre -post analysis,90 self-controlled risk interval analyses,96, 235 and two stud ies62, 63 using case -centered methods assessing diphthe ria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccines (DTaP) in children in this update . One study183 assessed the Infanrix\u00ae brand but the others did not specify the vaccine (vaccination status was determined using administrative data). One study183 of children that compare d DTaP plus routine vaccines to vaccine routines alone reported one case of asthma in 145 intervention participants and none in the 146 control participants , which resulted in an imprecise risk estimate (RR 2.01; CI 0.07, 59.56) . The same study also report ed that no deaths occurred in the intervention or the control group, again with an imprecise risk estimate (RR 1.01; CI 0.02, 50.40) . A pre -post study90 reported an increased incidence of sepsis evaluation (adjusted r ate ratio 3.2; CI 2.2, 4.5), respiratory support ( adjusted rate ratio 1.9; CI 1.4, 2.6), and intubation ( adjusted rate ratio 2.5; CI 1.3, 4.8) in extremely low birth weight infants after receipt of D TaP compared to t he period before vaccination. One self - controlled risk interval analysis235 using Vaccine Safety Datalink data from 1995 to 2015 identified a risk of seizures following DTaP among chi ldren aged 11 to 23 months, but subsequent analyses adjusting for age at vaccination and concomitant vaccines showed no evidence of increased risk (incidence risk ratio [ IRR] 1.2; CI 0.9, 1.6) . A related study using the same population for a subset of thos e same years (2004 -2008) for children under 24 months of age showed no increased risk of seizures following DTaP for either children three months and younger (IRR 1.26; CI 0.65, 2.45) or 3 -23 months (IRR 1.56; CI 0.19, 12.92). Another self - controlled risk interval analysis 96 looking at febrile seizures specifically found no increased risk during the first day following vaccination compared to a control period of 14 to 20 days (IRR 64 1.17; CI 0.52, 2.60). This same study found increased risk of febrile seizures when a DTaP - containing vaccine was given with trivalent IIV compared to trivalent IIV given on a separate day from DTaP -containing vaccines (ratio of IRRs 7.57; CI 2.40, 23.89), but the study only reported across all DTaP -containing vaccines (including combination vaccines such as Pediarix\u00ae and Pentacel\u00ae) for this analysis. One study62 using case- centered methods reported no increased risk of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in the 5 - to 28- day risk interval following DTaP , compared to the remaining nine months after vaccination (aOR 0; CI 0.0, 270.4). Another case - centered analysis63 detected no association between sudden sensorineural hearing loss and DTaP within one week of vaccination (OR 0; CI 0, 36.61). No other adverse events associated with DTaP were reported. Tdap We also identified four studies62, 63, 173, 187 assessing Tdap and Td in samples containing children and adults. One was a study of Tdap plus MenACWY (Nimenrix\u00ae, which is a brand used in Europe) versus MenACWY alone;187 the other three studies were case -centered analyses62, 63, 173 that used a large dataset of participants who received Tdap or Td. The study187 of Tdap plus MenACWY versus MenACWY alone reported no el evated risk of cardiovascular events or death (RR 0.99; CI 0.02, 49.53 for both outcomes); the risk estimate was imprecise for both outcomes as no cases occurred among either intervention or control groups (0/231 vs 0/228). One study 62 reported an increased risk of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in the 5 to 28-day risk interval following Tdap , compared to the remaining nine months after va ccination (aOR 15.8; CI 1.2, 471.6). N o other study investigated this outcome after Tdap, and the effect has not been replicated. The study reported insufficient detail to compute effect sizes , which would have allow ed comparisons to other studies , so we could not pool results to better understand the frequency of this adverse event. In addition, severity was not reported, al though in general acute disseminated encephalomyelitis \u2014inflammation in the brain and spinal cord that damages myelin , which is the pro tective covering of nerve fibers \u2014can have a variable course that can include severe illness. Overall, the number of cases (two) was very small. The investigators noted that one of the cases was a healthy adult who had been vaccinated 11 days prior to sympt om onset, and the second case was a child who received both Tdap and meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (which was not recommended for the child's age group at that time). One case would have been expected statistically, and thus it was the presence of a second case that made the result significant and as a result the confidence intervals were very wide (with the lower confidence interval being closer to 1). Finally, the study had a large number of statistical comparisons without adjusting for multiple te sting, meaning that the result could also be due to chance alone. Assuming the result was real, the absolute estimated excess risk was extremely small at 0.385 (CI - .04, 1.16) cases per million doses. No risk factors were explored in this study given the s mall number of cases, but this could also be an area for future investigation. The same study 62 found no increased risk of transverse myelitis during the immediate post vaccination period or optic neuritis in the 2- to 42 -day risk interval after vaccination with Tdap or Td versus the remainder of the nine months after vaccination. Another case- centered analysis63 detected no association between sudden sensorineural hearing loss and Tdap (OR 0.84; CI 0.39, 1.62) or Td (OR 0; CI 0.00, 2.67) within one week of vaccination. Finally, one study173 reported no increased risk of primary ovarian failure after Tdap (aHR 0.88; CI 0.37, 2.10) . 65 Haemophilus influenzae Type b V accine s We identified two self -controlled risk interval analyses,96, 235 and one pre -post study90 reporting on Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib) in children in this update . The authors did not provide the specific brand name s of Hib used. The pre -post study90 found an increased incidence of sepsis evaluation (adjusted rate ratio 4.0; CI 3.3, 4.8), respiratory support ( adjusted rate ratio 2.1; CI 1.8, 2.5), and intubations ( adjusted rate ratio 1.6; CI 1.2, 2.7) in extremely low birth weight infants after vaccination w ith Hib compared to the period before vaccination; this was not replicated in other studies. One self -controlled risk interval analysis235 using Vaccine Safety Datalink data from 1995 to 2015 identified no risk of seizures following Hib among children aged 11 to 23 months (IRR 1.0; CI 0.8, 1.2) , nor did a related study using the same population for a subset of those same years (2004 -2008) for children under 24 months of age. Another stu dy96 looking at febrile seizures specifically found no increased risk during the first day following vaccination compared to a control period of 14 to 20 days (IRR 1.53; CI 0.87, 2.72). We identified one case -centered analysis 62 assessing Hib in a sample of children and adults . The study reported no increased risk of acut e disseminated encephalomyelitis or transverse myelitis in the 5- to 28- day risk interval following vaccination with Hib (brand not specified) versus the remainder of the nine months after vaccination. Hepatitis Vaccines Hepatitis A Vaccine We identified o ne case control study158 and one self -controlled risk interval analysis96 evaluating HepA (among other vaccines) in children in this update .90 We also identified two case- centered analyses62, 63 assessin g HepA in mixed sample s of children and adults . The case- control study158 assessed the relationship of HepA to adverse events in children with new neuropsychiatric disorders. The study reported a slight association between a broken bone (HR 1.08; CI 1.02, 1.13), obsessive compulsive di sorder (HR 1.40; CI 1.07, 1.82), and attention deficit hyperactive disorder (HR 1.09; CI 1.02, 1.18) diagnosis but no association with open wound, anorexia, anxiety disorder, tic disorder, major depression, or bipolar disorder for HepA. 158 The self -controlled risk interval analysis96 found no increased risk of febrile seizures during the first day following vaccination with HepA compared to a control period of 14 to 20 days (IRR 0.88; 0.56, 1.38) . Of studies that combined children and adults, one case- centered analysis62 assessed HepA over a 10- month follow up. The authors reported no increased risk of acute disseminated enceph alomyelitis, optic neuritis, or transverse myelitis in the short term interval following vaccines versus the remainder of the nine months after vaccination. Another case- centered analysis63 detected no association between sudden sensorineural hearing loss and HepA (OR 0; CI 0.00, 3.42) within one week of vaccination. Hepatitis B Vaccine s We identified one case -control study,158 one self -controlled risk interval analysis,96 and one pre-post study evaluating HepB (among other vaccines) in children in this update .90 We also identified two case- centered analyses62, 63 assessing HepB in mixed sample s of children and adults . The case- control study158 assess ed the relationship of HepB to adverse events in children with new neuropsychiatric disorders. There were no associations of adverse events with HepB. 66 The pre -post study90 found an increased incidence of sepsis evaluation (adjusted r ate ratio 3.1; CI 2.3, 4.1) and use of respiratory support (adjusted r ate ratio 2.1; CI 1.6, 2.8), but not intubations (adjusted r ate ratio 1.5; CI 0.9, 2.6) in extremely low birth weight infants after vaccination with HepB compared to the period before vaccination. The self-controlled risk interval analysis96 found no increased risk of febrile seizures during the first day following vaccination with HepB compared to a control period of 14 to 20 days (IRR 1.17; CI 0.31, 4.40) . One case- centered analysis62 combined children and adults and assessed Hep B over a 10- month follow up . The authors reported no increased risk of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, optic neuritis, or transverse myelitis in the short term interval following vaccines versus the remainder of the nine months after vaccination. Another case- centered analysis63 detected no association between sudden sensorineural hearing loss and HepB ( 0.67; CI 0.03, 3.51) within one week of vaccination. 9-Valent Human Papillomavirus Vaccine We identified two RCTs114, 228 that assessed the risk for adverse events among children who received HPV9. HPV9 was not available at the time of the prior 2014 report. Both RCTs114, 228 assessing HPV9 in children compared the vaccine with HPV2 and HPV4 respectively. One outcome, death, was assessed in both studies (RR 0.58; CI 0.00, 362688); the risk estimate was imprecise as neither study reported any deaths (0/27 vs 0/93 and 0/299 vs 0/300) one incidence of Henoch- Sch\u00f6nlein purpura and complex partial seizure each in the control group but not in the HPV9 group (RR 0.5; CI 0.02, 14.90 for both adverse events) . We identified four studies95, 111, 136, 226 of HPV9 that included children as well as adults. Two studies were RCTs136, 226 that compared HPV9 to HPV4 , while an other RCT111 compared HPV9 to placebo. The fourth study95 was a post -marketing real -time surveillance study. In one study111 that compared HPV9 to placebo, we found no evidence of increased risk of birth defects ( RR 0.50; CI 0.01, 25.22). When combined with another study136 that compared HPV9 to another HPV vaccine, there was still no evidence of increased risk ( RR 0.33; CI 0.00, 2276574) . In one study111 that compared HPV9 to placebo, we found no evidence of increased risk of reproductive system events ( RR 0.25; CI 0.01, 7.46) . When combined with another study136 that compared H PV9 to another HPV vaccine, there was still no evidence of increased risk (RR 1.01; CI 0.00, 383) . Although the RR was greater than 1, this was due to one excess event in the intervention group in one136 of the two studies ( 0/608 vs 1/305; 9/7071 vs 8/7078), resulting in extremely wide confidence intervals. In one study111 that compared HPV9 to placebo, we found no evidence of increased risk of death (RR 0.50; CI 0.01, 25.22). When combined with two other studies that compared HPV9 to another HPV vaccine , we still found no evidence of increased risk of death (RR 1.11; CI 0.10, 12.13) across the t hree studies.111, 136, 226 Two of the RCTs111, 226 had no deaths in either the intervention or control groups, and one RCT136 had one excess de ath (6/7071 vs 5/7078; none were considered to be vaccine -related by the investigators). One RCT136 of HPV9 found an RR of 2.00 (CI 0.07, 59.66) for anaphylaxis or systemic allergic reaction, an RR of 2.00 (CI 0.07, 59.66) for asthma and an RR of 2.00 (CI 0.18, 22.07) for multiple sclerosis. All three of these estimates had extremely wide confidence int ervals that suggest a wide range of either possible protective or higher risk. For anaphylaxis or allergic reaction and asthma, the RR estimate was due to one event each in the vaccine- treated group (out of 7071) and none among controls. For multiple scler osis, there was only one excess event 67 among the vaccine -treated group (2/7071 vs 1/7078). The same RCT136 identified an RR of 4.00 (CI 0.18, 88.77) for car diovascular events (in this case, orthostatic tachycardia syndrome), which occurred in two patients in the intervention group (out of 7071) and none in the control group (out of 7078), resulting in the extremely wide confidence intervals. A post -hoc analys is1091 of spontaneous abortions following HPV9 did note an imbalance (28.4% [ 19/67] vs 12.7% [ 7/55]) when compared to HPV4 among women who became pregnant within 30 days of vaccination. N o other meaningful differences in adverse events were reported in these studies. One post -marketing real -time surveillance study95 of HPV9 found no signals for any adverse events, including for pre -specified adverse events, including anaphylaxis, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, We identified two self-controlled 235 and evaluating inactivated vaccine ( IPV) in children in this update . The authors did not provide the br and name of the IPV used . One self -controlled risk interval analysis235 using Vaccine Safety Datalink data from 1995 to 2015 identified no risk of seizures following IPV among children aged 11 to 23 months ( IRR 1.0 ; CI 0.7, 1.4) , nor did a related study using the same population for a subset of those same years (2004- 2008) for children under 24 months of age. Another study96 found no increased risk of febrile seizures during the first day following vaccination compared to a control period of 14 to 20 days (IRR 1.41; 0.08, 24.53). A pre-post evaluation90 reported an increased incidence of sepsis evaluati on (adjusted rate ratio 3.0; CI 2.1, 4.2), use of respiratory support ( adjusted rate ratio 2.1; CI 1.5, 2.9), and intubations (adjusted r ate ratio 2.5; CI 1.3, 4.9) in extremely low birth weight infants before and after IPV . No other outcomes were assessed in studies in children. We identified two case- centered analyses62, 63 assessing IPV in a broader sample of children and adults. One of these studies62 reported no increased risk of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in the 5- to 28- day ris k interval following administration of IPV compared with the remainder of the nine months after vaccination (aOR 0; CI 0.00, 270.1). The other case- centered analysis63 detected no association between sudden sensorineural hearing loss and IPV within one week of vaccination (OR 0; CI 0, 92.95). Influenza Vaccines Quadrivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccines We identified eight RCTs94, 117, 129, 152, 153, 188, 234 and one historically -controlled cohort design study combined with a self -controlled risk interval analysis160 assessing quadrivalent IIV in children quadrivalent IIV not otherwise specified (study in the Vaccine Safety Datalink of available quadrivalent IIV in the United States) .160 Quadrivalent IIV was compared to trivalent IIV in all but one of the trials;94, 117, 129, 152, 153, 188, 234 in th at one trial , the control group received the same base treatment as the intervention group (PCV13 and DTaP).233 Across five studies,94, 117, 129, 152, 234 there was no evidence of increased risk of seizures (RR 1.08; CI 0. 11, 10.40). All five studies had one or no events occur \u2014two studies94, 152 had no events in either group, two studies117, 129 had one event in the intervention group, and none in the 68 control group, and one study234 had one event in the control group only. Across four studies,94, 117, 152, 153 there was no evidence of increased risk of febrile seizures (RR 1.2 8; CI 0. 17, 9.83) . In the study117 with the most events (8/2892 vs 2/734), none of the febrile seizures in the intervention group were attributed to the vaccine (one event was attributed to the control vaccine in the control group). Two studies94, 152 had no febrile seizures in either group, and a fourth study153 had one event in the intervention group (a simple partial febrile seizure 6 hours after vaccination that resolved without sequelae). Across three studies,94, 117, 152 there was no evidence of increased risk of cardiovascular events (RR 2.01; CI 0.03, 148). The relative risk estimate was imprecise as only one event (bradycardia not related to the vaccine in one study,117 myocarditis not related to the vaccine in another study,94 and hypertension in the third study152) occurred in the intervention group in each of the studies ( 1/915 vs 0/1823; 1/2892 vs 0/734; 1/932 vs 0/1861). Across another three studies,117, 152, 153 we also found no evidence of increased risk of asthma (RR 1.77; CI 0.03, 117) ; the risk estimate was imprecise due to differing sizes of the intervention and co ntrol groups (8/2892 vs 0/734; 0/932 vs 0/1861; 0/299 vs 1/302). We detected no evidence of increased risk of autoimmune disease (RR 0.50; CI 0.00, 2849944) across two studies;129, 153 the risk estimate was imprecise due to one event in each study (0/1149 vs 1/1149 and 0/299 vs 1/302). We found no evidence of increased risk of anaphylaxis or systemic allergic reaction (RR 1.41; CI 0.00, 8066971) across two studies;129, 153 again the risk estimate was imprecise with only one case in each study (1/1149 vs 0/1149 and 0/932 vs 1/1861). There was no evidence of increased risk of death in one RCT233 when comparing to base treatment received by both intervention and control groups ( RR 1.08; CI 0.02, 53.95), with no deaths occurring in either group in the study (0/99 vs 0/107). W hen combined with five RCTs117, 129, 152, 188, 234 comparing to trivalent IIV , there was still no evidence of incr eased risk of death and the RR was no longer greater than 1 (RR 0.73; CI 0.10, 5.63). In one study,117 the RR for Kawasaki disease was greater than 1 but not statistically significant (RR 1.52; CI 0.08, 30.37) due to 3 events in the intervention group; none of these events were considered to be related to the vaccine by the study authors. A self -controlled risk interval analysis 160 found no increased risk of febrile seizures following IIV4 when alone given without concomitant vaccines (OR 1.2; CI 0.12, 11.20) (the study also examined other outcomes using a larger cohort and found no increased risk, but risk estimates were not provided). A sensitivity analy sis of the new cell -based quadrivalent IIV (Flucelvax Quadrivalent) approved for children 4 years of age and older based on one study 129 that compared to trivalent cell-based IIV showed no evidence of increased r isk of anaphylaxis or systemic allergic reaction (RR 2.00; CI 0.07, 59.56), autoimmune disease (RR 0.50; CI 0.02, 14.89), seizures (RR 2.00; CI 0.07, 59.56), or death (RR 1.00; CI 0.02, 50.35). Quadrivalent Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine We identified t hree RCT s, 69, 163, 164 one pre -post study,76 and one cohort study207 assessing quadrivalent LAIV in this update. A ll studies were of FluMist Quadrivalent. Quadrivalent LAIV was compared to trivalent placebo in one RCT,164 IIV (trivalent or quadrivalent) in one cohort study,207 and matched unvaccinated controls in one study.76 We found no evidence of increased risk of seizure across two studies76, 164 that compared quadrivalent LAIV to placebo or no vaccine (RR 1.8 0; CI 0. 06, 53.57) ; the risk estimate was imprecise as it was across only two studies, and the intervention and control groups differed in size (22/6745 vs 36/20163 and 1/868 vs 0/433). We also found no evidence of increased risk of 69 death across another two studies,69, 163 both of which compared quadrivalent LAIV to trivalent LAIV (RR 0.82; CI 0.00, 50615229); the risk estimate was imprecise as no deaths occurred i n either study (0/1382 vs 0/923 and 0/66 vs 0/67) . In one study69 of quadrivalent LAIV, the RR for diabetes following vaccination was 1.34 (CI 0.04, 39.77), due to one event in the intervention group only which was not thought to be due to vaccination. In another study,207 the RR of febrile seizures was 1.39 (CI 0.03, 69.76) but no events occurred in either the intervention or control groups ( 0/226 vs 0/314). We identified one study61 assessing quadrivalent LAIV that did not differentiate between children and adults. This study compared quadrivalent LAIV recipients to unvaccinated controls and controls who received IIV, and also performed a within -cohort analysis comparing risk interval and control windows. The study reported no cases of seizure or convulsions, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, Bell's palsy, or encephalitis among vaccinated or unvaccinated participants. Significant findings included a lower risk of respiratory infection ( adjusted HR 0.61; CI 0.50, 0.75) , wheezing (adjusted HR 0.66; CI 0.52, 0.84) or any hospitalization (RR 0.35; CI 0.24, 0.50) compared to matched unvaccinated controls . There was a higher risk of wheezing (but not asthma specifically ) among quadrivalent LAIV recipients two to four years of age than among unvaccinated controls (adjuste d HR 1.50; CI 1.03, 2.20) ; none were hospitalized . There was no increased risk of wheezing among children with a history of wheezing or asthma. Measles, Mumps, and R ubella Vaccine We identified one case -control study,224 three self-controlled risk interval analys es,96, 167, 235 and four cohort studies113, 138, 141, 215 evaluating MMR in children in this update . None of the studies specified the brand name of the specific vaccine used (all studies used administrative data to determine vaccination status and were presumed to use MMR -II based on the setting). One self -controlled case series 235 of children who received MMR reported an increased risk of seizures following vaccination at 12 months (IRR 2.9 ; CI 2.1, 4.1), 15 months ( IRR 4.3 ; CI 3.2, 5.9), and 18 months ( IRR 6.4 ; CI 4.4, 9.3) , but did not provide sufficient detail for further analyses. Of note, the majority of the seizure events were likely to be acute febrile seizures per the authors of a related study282 considered to be a multiple publication (due to entirely overlapping population and time frame). A self -controlled risk interval analysis167 comparing the risk of seizures during the seven to ten days following receipt of MMR to a control window of 15 to 42 days found significantly increased risk of seizures both in children who had been born full - term (IRR 2.7; CI 2.2 , 3.2) and pre -term (IRR 3.2; CI 1.9 , 5.3). Concomitant vaccines, including varicella, were not controlled for in this analysis . These authors also noted that the event s represented primarily febrile seizures. However, this study is not included as independent evidence for the risk of seizures and febrile seizures due to the overlap entirely with the time frame and population in the prior study. A study 113 comparing a cohort of children who had received MMR to a cohort of those who had not found an increased risk of seizures (HR 5.94; 2.81, 12.58) and se izure disorders (HR 17.4; 2.23, 136) in adjusted analyses, and the finding was consistent in a self -controlled case series and additional sensitivity analyses. The authors did not distinguish between febrile and afebrile seizures. Another study96 assessing febrile seizures specifically found no increased risk during the first day following vaccination compared to a control period of 14 to 20 days (I RR 0.78; 0.44,1.40). However , fever and febrile seizures tend to be seen later with vaccines such as MMR, hence the risk interval may have been too soon after vaccination to detect events . 70 Two cohort studies138, 141 compared those who received MMR to those who had not and reported no evidence of increased risk of autism (RR 0.60; CI 0.09, 4.12). The studies did not report on other adverse events. A third study,224 which used a case -control approach, also found no association between MMR and autism at any age, including up to 36 months of age (OR 1.04; CI 0.65, 1.68). A cohort study215 examined the risk of asthma after MMR and found no evidence of increased risk (RR 0.37; CI 0.20, 0.67). We identified two case- centered analyses62, 63 assessing MMR in children and adults over a ten-month follow up period. One study62 evaluated MMR (brand unspecified but presumed to be MMR -II) and reported adjusted ri sk ratios. The authors reported no increased risk of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, optic neuritis, or transverse myelitis in the short term interval following vaccines versus the remainder of the nine months after vaccination. The other study63 detected no association between sudden sensorineural hearing loss and MMR within one week of vaccination (OR 0; CI 0, 33.29). Meningococcal Vaccines Meningococcal A, C, W, and Y V accines We identified eight RCTs51, 57, 68, 79, 105, 112, 219, 978 across both reports and one self -controlled case series127 assessing MenACWY in children in this update . Studies evaluated MenACWY -D (Menactra) ,127 MenACWY- CRM (Menveo) ,51, 68, 105, 112, 219, 978 and MenAC WY-TT (MenQuad fi).57, 79 Of studies that did not use a self- controlled design, four RCTs51, 112, 219, 978 compared MenACWY -CRM to base treatment received by both the intervention and control groups and two RCTs68, 105 compared MenACWY -CRM to meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV; Menomune\u00ae, which is no longer in use). Of the two RCTs of MenACWY -TT, one RCT57 compared to MPSV and one RCT79 compared to MenACWY -CRM and to base treatment received by both the intervention and control groups. In terms of age groups studied, three studies51, 219, 978 examined the use of MenACWY in young infants (55 -89 days of age), four studies57, 68, 105, 127 in children (2- 9 or 2 -10 years of age), and two studies79, 112 in older children and adolescents (10 -17 or 10- 18 years of age. One RCT219 did not report on adverse events in a way that could be interpreted across intervention and comparator, except for severe local and systemic adverse events and is not discussed further here. One Phase II RCT 68 found no serious AEs comparing those vaccinated with MenACWY- CRM versus meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Across four RCTs51, 79, 112, 978 that compared MenACWY to a non- meningococcal vaccine comparator, there was no evidence of increased risk of death (RR 1.37; CI 0.11, 16.65). When including all RCTs even if the comparator was another meningococcal vaccine, 51, 57, 78, 79, 105, 112, 978 there was still no e vidence of increased risk of death (RR 1.17; CI 0.24; 5.73). Of note, although the RR was greater than 1, only one51 of the four studies had any deaths (7/5772 in vaccinated participants versus 1/1968 in the control group) . The authors of this study examined the causes of these deaths and concluded that none were vaccine- related. When combined with another three RCTs57, 78, 105 that compared to another meningococcal vaccine, the relative risk was similar (RR 1.17; CI 0.24, 5.73); there were no deaths in any of these three additional studies. There was no evidence of increased risk of asthma in one RCT79 (RR 1.51; CI 0.05, 44.86) when comparing Me nACWY- TT plus routine vaccines to routine vaccines alone. The relative risk remained similar when combined with another group within the same RCT105 that compared MenACWY -TT to MenACWY -CRM, and another RCTs -CRM 71 to another meningococcal vaccine (one105 to MPSV and the other57 to MenACWY- CRM) (RR 1.14; CI 0. 08, 16.49). The RR was greater than 1, but based on only two cases of asthma across the three studies (2343 vaccinated individuals in total). Given the prevalence of asthma among children, the observed incidence appears to be low and the severity of the events was not clear. In one RCT51 there was no evidence of increased ri sk of cardiovascular events ( RR 0.34; CI 0.02, or idiopathic thrombocytopenic 0.17; CI 0.01, 5.09). These results remained non- significant when combined with another RCT57 that compared MenACWY -TT to MenACWY -CRM 6069454). One RCT51 with routine vaccines as a comparator reported no evidence of increased risk of febrile seizures (RR 0.51; CI 0.18, 1.44); the risk estimate did not change when combined with one RCT105 with meningococcal polysacchari de vaccine as a comparator and another RCT57 with MenACWY- CRM as a comparator ( RR 0.57; CI 0.07, 4.65). One RCT79 that compared MenACWY plus routine vaccines to routine vaccines alone showed no evidence of increased risk of seizures (RR 1.51; CI 0.05, 44.86) . When combined across another group from the same RCT78 and two other RCTs57, 105 where the comparators were other meningococcal vaccines, no evidence of increased risk was found (RR 0.97; CI 0.07, 12.98) and the RR no longer favored the control for seizures. Across two RCTs ,79, 112 there was no evidence of increased risk of diabetes (RR 1.32; CI 0.00, 21861366) ; the risk estimate was imprecise because there was only one event across both studies (1/396 vs 0/397 and 0/392 vs 0/296). The rela tive risk of diabetes remained similar when including a second population from one of the RCTs where the comparison was another meningococcal vaccine (RR 1.53; CI 0.02, 137). One RCT51 examined the risk of Kawasaki disease among recipients of MenACWY, finding an RR of 1.37 (CI 0.15, 12.22). Of four cases observed in the vaccinated group, the authors believed that two could be related to vaccination, but there was also one case seen in the control group. Another RCT57 that used an active comparator found no cases of Kawasaki disease; when combi ned the RR was 1.27 (CI 0.00, 306194). One RCT79 found an RR of 1.51 for both asthma and seizures ( CI 0.05, 44.86), due to one excess case in the intervention group (1/392 vs 0/296) resulting in extremely wide confidence intervals. One study127 of chi ldren through 10 years of age looked at the rates of outcomes per 1,000 person- months during a risk window compared to a control window and found no increased risk, including for asthma among children aged 2- 10 years ( RR 0.98 ; CI 0.03, 38.35), asthma among those aged 9 -23 months ( RR 1.48; 0.04, 57.69) , convulsions among ( RR 0.00; 0.00, 18.68) , and febrile seizures among those aged 9- 23 months ( RR not evaluable). Looking specifically at the newest vaccine, MenACWY -TT (MenQuad fi), one RCT79 had four groups constituting comparisons: MenACWY -TT plus routine vaccines (Tdap and HPV4) alone, and hen comparing MenACWY -TT plus routine vaccines to routine vaccines alone, there were no deaths in either group (RR 0.76; CI 0.02, 37.94), nor when including the comparisons between MenACWY -TT and MenACWY - CRM (RR 0.91; CI 0.01, 130). There was no evidence of increased risk of asthma (RR 1.51; CI 0.05, 44.86), nor when including the two comparisons to MenACWY -CRM (RR 1.13; CI 0.02, 70.54). When compared to routine vaccines alone, there was no evidence of increased risk of diabetes (RR 0.76; CI 0.02, 37.94), nor was there evidence of increased risk when combined with a pair of groups from the same trial that compared MenACWY -TT to MenACWY -CRM (RR 72 1.31; CI 0.00, 21815040). When compared to routine vaccines alone, there was no evidence of increased risk of seizur es (RR 1.51; CI 0.05, 44.86), nor was there evidence of increased risk when including the two comparisons of MenACWY -TT to MenACWY -CRM (RR MenACWY -TT to MenACWY -CRM looked at cardiovascular events, and found no evidence of increased risk (RR 1.98; 0.07, 59.00). The same RCT looked at febrile seizures, Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and Kawasaki disease and found no evidence of increased risk (RR 0.99; CI 0.02, 49.89 for all). We identified eight studies56, 62, 63, 93, 128, 157, 173, 220 assessing meningococcal A, C, W and Y vaccines in samples of children and adults. Studies assessed MenACWY -D (Menactra), MenACWY -CRM (Menveo), and MenACWY- TT (MenQuad fi). One study173 did not report the brand used, but took place in the United States. Of those studies that were not self -controlled, two56, 93 compared MenACWY -TT to MenACWY -D, and one157 compared MenACWY -CRM to placebo. In terms of age groups studied, three studies93, 128, 157 examined children and adults 10 or 11 years of age through 55 years of age, one220 examined children and adults 11 to 21 years of age, one examined children and adults 15 to 59 years of age,56 one173 examined female children and adults aged 11 through 34 years, and two62, 63 did not specify the ages studied (used a large administrative database and presumably included all those individuals for whom the vaccine was indicated). Three RCTs 56, 93, 157 reported on death as the outcome and found no evidence of increased risk (RR 0.50 ; CI 0.00, 71.42); the risk estimate was imprecise as deaths did not occur in any of the stud ies (0/297 vs -CRM (Menveo) reported no serious adverse events in either the vaccine or placebo group. Looking specifically at the newest vaccine, MenACWY -TT, ( MenQuad fi), one RCT93 that enrolled children and adult s and compared MenACWY -TT to MenACWY -D reported no evidence of increased risk of anaphylaxis (RR 0.24; 0.00, 11.95); asthma , cardiovascular events (coronary artery disease) , diabetes, multiple sclerosis, seizures ( status epilepticus) , or spontaneous aborti on (RR 0.47; CI 0.02, RCT,56 there was one case of pulmonary embolism in the MenACWY -TT group and no cases in the MenACWY -D group. Across the two RCTs56, 93 of MenACWY -TT (both compared to MenACWY -D) there was no evidence of increased risk of death, with no deaths in either trial. A self -controlled case series220 of MenACWY- CRM (Menveo) in children and adults reported an increased r isk for Bell's palsy in participant s receiving concomitant vaccines ( risk incidence [ RI] 5.0; CI 1.4, 17.8) and no increased risk for those without concomitant vaccine (RI 1.1; CI 0.2, 5.5). The same study reported no elevated risk for other outcomes including anaphylaxis (confirmed by chart review), aseptic meningitis, asthma, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Hashimoto's purpura, juvenile diabetes, mu ltiple arthritis, seizure (confirmed by chart review), or transverse myelitis. In a retrospective cohort study128 of MenACWY -D (Menactra) , the study investigator considered two serious adverse events possibly related to vaccination: new -onset diabetes mellitus in a participant with family history and new - onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in a patient with family history. After review of medical records, investigators concluded these conditions were not likely related to vaccination. Thi s study also reported elevated short -term (0 -30 days) risk (IRR 11.80; CI 2.04, 254.6) and long- term (6 months) risk ( IRR 1.93; CI 1.18, 3.20) for febrile illness. Medical record review of 73 outcomes with significantly elevated IRRs did not suggest any relat ionship with MenACWY -D vaccine. One study62 of children and adults used a case -centered design to assess both MenACWY- D specifically as well as all MenACWY as a group over 10 months of follow up. For both vaccine types , the study reported no increased risk of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or transverse myelitis, and for all MenACWY (Menactra alone not examine d for this outcome) no increased risk of optic neuritis in the short term interval following vaccin ation versus the remainder of the nine months after vaccination. Another case- centered analysis63 detected no association between sudden sensorineural hearing loss and MenACWY within one week of vaccination (OR 0; CI 0, 21.06). Finally, one study173 reported no increased risk of primary ovarian failure after MenACWY (aHR 0.94; CI 0.27, 3.23) . Meningococcal B V accines We identified five RCTs156, 186, 193, 196, 230 assessing MenB in children (not in use at the time of the prior report). S tudies assessed either Bexsero or Trumenba. Four studies186, 193, 196, 230 compared to a non- active comparator (placebo or routine vaccines that the intervention group received); one study156 of Bexsero compared the vaccine to placebo (for dose 1) and MenACWY -CRM (for dose 2). O ne study193 reported that there were no vaccine -related serious adverse events. The risk estimates were im precise for all three outcomes reported across more than one study as there were only two or three studies and the events w ere infrequent (none or one per group); rates are reported after each risk estimate. Across two MenB studies186, 196 in children , there was no evidence of increased risk of anaphylaxis or systemic allergic reaction (RR 0.56; CI 0.00, 34735108; 0/198 vs 0/121 and 0/992 vs 0/501) There was also no evidence of increased risk of death across another two studies196, 230 (RR 1.12; CI 0.00, 18531125; 0/992 vs 0/501 and 1/374 vs 0/378) ; the one death that occurred in the vaccinated group was due to a motor vehicle accident. Across three studies,156, 186, 230 there was no evidence of increased risk of reproduc tive system events (RR 0. 89; CI vs 0/121; 0/374 vs 1/378). also identified one case of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura among those vaccinated (N=374) compared to none in the control group (N=378), for an RR of 2.02 (CI 0.07, 60.07); the confidence intervals were extremely wide as a result. We identified one RCT178 in childre n and adults that compared MenB (Trumenba) to placebo . The study did not assess any key adverse events, but showed more reactogenicity events with the vaccine. Pneumococcal Vaccines 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine We identified five RCTs,55, 86, 87, 146, 217 one cohort study,206 two self-controlled risk interval analys es,59, 96 one self -controlled case series analysis,238 and two pre -post studies58, 221 assessing PCV13 in children in this update . Of the studies that were not self -controlled, four RCTs55, 87, 146, 217 compared PCV13 to PCV7 plus a base treatment received by both the intervention and control groups, and two studies (one RCT and one cohort study) compared PCV13 to a base treatmen t received by both groups (trivalent IIV in one study 206 and MenACWY -TT in the other86). Across t hree RCTs ,87, 146, 217 there was no evidence of increased risk of asthma (RR 1.49; CI 0.15, 14.39) , although all three identified studies reported more events in the PCV13 group 74 compared to PCV7 or routine vaccines received by all participants . The risk estimate across studies was greater than 1, but was imprecise due to few events occurring across three studies with variable sample sizes ( 1/84 vs 0/88; 7/882 vs 5/875; 1/183 vs 0/183). None of these events were attributed to PCV13 by the investigators. Across another three RCTs55, 87, 146 there was no evidence of increased risk of cardiovascular events (RR 0.60; CI 0.01, 38.23) or seizures ( RR 0.91; CI 0.05, 15.11). For risk estimates acro ss two studies, the risk estimate was imprecise due to the small number of studies and of events in each study. A cross two RCTs ,55, 87 there was no evidence of increased risk of meningitis (RR 1.32; CI 0.00, 1451908; vs 1/931). Across two RCTs,87, 146 there was no evidence of increased risk of intussusception ( RR 0/875). Across two RCTs,146, 217 there was no evidence of increased risk of Kawasaki disease ( RR 1.33; In the study146 with one excess case in the intervention group, the event was not attributed to PCV13 . One self -controlled case series analysis238 found no increased risk following any of three doses of PCV13, but did find an increased risk of complete Kawasaki disease specifically fo llowing the first dose of PCV13 (RI 2.59; CI 1.16, 5.81) based on seven patients who served as their own controls . One pre -post study58 report ed an age -adjusted risk estimate for Kawasaki disease of 1.07 (CI 0.70, 1.63) in a self-controlled case series and 0.97 (CI 0.79, 1.19) compared to an unvaccinated cohort. Another pre-post study221 reported no evidence of increased risk of Kawasaki disease when comparing those who received PCV13 with those who received PCV7 (RR 1.94; 0.79, 4.86). There was no evidence of increased risk of death in an RCT86 that compared PCV13 to a base treatment received by both intervention and control groups (RR 2.02; CI 0.07, 59.88; 1/193 vs 0/195); the death that occurred was considered unrelated to the vaccine by study authors as the cause was asphyxiation 121 days post -vaccination. W hen combined with four other RCTs55, 87, 146, 217 that compared PCV13 to PCV7, the risk estimate remained n on-significant (RR 1.18; CI 0.12, 11.32). Across all five studies,55, 86, 87, 146, 217 there were two deaths in the vaccinated group and one in the control group ( 0/84 vs vs 0/183). At least one of the two deaths in the vaccinated group was thought to be unrelated to the vaccine according to the study authors as above; the other was a sudden death of unknown cause. One RCT87 examined the risk of autoimmune disease (Henoch -Sch\u00f6nlein purpura) and identified one case in the vaccinated group and none in the control group (1/929 vs 0/931), resulting in an RR of 2.00 (CI 0.07, 59.07) with low precision given the rare events. One study59 found a significant association between PCV13 and febrile seizures. This effect held through both unadjusted and adjusted models , with an IRR adjusted for age, calendar time and concomitant IIV of 1.80 (C I 1.29, 2.52). This i ncreased risk was not reported in five other studies. In a cohort study206 comparing PCV13 plus IIV to IIV alone, there was no evidence of increased risk of febrile seizures (RR 0.98; CI 0.02, 49.22). When combined w ith the two RCTs55, 217 that compared PCV13 to PCV7, the result remained non- significant (RR 1.24; CI 0.12, 12.81) . A self -controlled risk interval analysis96 reported no increased risk of febrile seizures during the first day following vaccination compared to a control period of 14 to 20 days (IRR 1. 41; CI 0. 08, 24.53). This same study found an increased risk of febrile seizures when a PCV vaccine was given with trivalent IIV compared to trivalent IIV given alone on a separate day from a PCV vaccine (ratio of IRRs IIV3 7.57; 1.91, 30.07, but the study mixed both PCV7 75 which is no longer in use and PCV13 in this analysis. A pre-post study221 of PCV13 compared to PCV7 reported no increased risk of febrile seizures, but there was an overlap in population studied and time frame with the study96 of febrile seizures detailed above. One pre -post study221 identified a n increased risk for encephalopathy, but this was not confirmed following the medical record review. This same pre- post study221 reported no increased risk of febrile seizures (as discussed above ), urticaria or angioneurotic ed ema, asthma, thrombocytopenia, or anaphylaxis for PCV13 compared to PCV7. There was o ne study of children and adults that used a case- centered design to assess PCV13 over ten months of follow up.62 The study reported no increased risk of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, or transverse myelitis in the short term interval following vaccination compared to the remainder of the nine months after vaccination. 23-Valent Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine Among two studies that included children and adults in this update, one study62 of children and adults used a case- centered design to assess PPSV23 over ten months of follow up. T he study reported no increased risk of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, optic neuritis , or transverse myelitis in the short term interval following vaccin ation compared to the remainder of the nine months after vaccination. Another case -centered analysis63 detected no association between sudden sensorineural hearing loss and PPSV23 within one week of vaccination (OR 0.81; CI 0.20, 2.26). Rotavirus Vaccine s A large number of studies has addressed rotavirus vaccines. Across both reports, w e identified 22 RCTs 92, 139, 161, 169, 229, 909, 924, 967, 969, 972, 973, events associated with the use of rotavirus vaccines in children. In this update we identified three case control studies,75, 108, 175 nine pre-post studies,73, 83, 106, 130, 131, 168, 190, 213, 223 and four cohort studies .115, 155, 189, 225 We also identified eight self-controlled case series,102, 122, 133, 135, 208, 212, 235, 237 and two self -controlled risk interval analyses.96, 236 Studies assessed RotaTeq\u00ae or Rotarix\u00ae vaccines. In all studies that were not self -controlled, rotavirus vaccine was compared to either placebo or the sa me base treatment as was received by the intervention group (e.g., routine vaccines). One RCT92 only reported on Grade 3 diarrhea and the overall rate of serious adverse events, and is not discussed further here. Rotavirus vaccine s and intussusception. Across all unique RCTs139, 161, 169, 229, 909, 924, 967, 972, examined intussusception as an outcome from both the prior report and the update , we found no evidence for increased risk of intussusception ( RR 0.65; CI 0.41, 1.05) at the time of latest follow -up. Thre e additional studies106, 131, 168 demonstrat ed no increase at the population level in intussusception rates before and after introduction of the rotavirus vaccine, and another two studies122, 133 showed no significant difference in intussusception rates in a group of patients before and after receiving rotavirus vaccine . Another study 212 demon strated no significant increase in intussusception risk following any dose of rotavirus vaccine . One study108 showed no increased risk of intussusception with the first dose or any dose (though the vaccine coverage was low in the region, which may have precluded detecting an increased risk). A study155 of infants who received rotavirus vacci ne together with DTaP compared to infants who received DTaP alone found no increased risk of intussusception (nor of Kawasaki disease, febrile seizures, seizures, meningitis, or encephalitis). Finally, a study74 of rotavirus vaccine found no increased risk of 76 intussusception, whether looking at children who were fully vaccinated (a HR 0.79; CI 0.57, 1.09) or partially vaccinated ( aHR 0.89; CI 0.66, 1.19). However, the authors of other studies identified in this update reported an increased ri sk of intussusception (primarily after the first dose). One study75 show ed an increase in the relative incidence of intussusception in infants sev en days following the first dose of RotaTeq (RI 9.9; CI . One study102 reported an increased IRR in the days following the first RotaTeq vaccination (IRR 3.45 ; CI 1.85, 6.55) . One study175 show ed a significantly increased adjusted odds of intussusception in individual s who received the first dose of rotavirus vaccine compared to those who did not (aOR 5.74; CI 1.51, 21.79) . Another study236 found an attributable risk of 1.5 excess cases intussusception per 100,000 recipients (CI 0.2, 3.2) in the 21 days following the first dose of RotaTeq but not following Rotarix ( although the st udy was underpowered for Rotarix) . A study237 of infants in Singapore reporting an increased relative incidence of intussusception in the seven days following the first dos e of Rotarix vaccination (RI 8.36; CI 2.42, 28.96) . A series135 in Taiwan showed an increase in intussusception risk in the first seven days (IRR 12.59; CI 8.07, 19.66) and eight to 21 days (IRR 1.78; CI 1.00- 3.16) following the first dose of Rotarix, but not Rota Teq. Another self-controlled case series study208 in England showed significantly increased relative incidence of intussusception in the 21 days after both the first (RI 4.53; CI 2.34, 8.58) and second (RI 2.60; CI 1.43, 4.81) doses of Rotarix, with the peak risk occurring one to seven days after the first dose (RI 13.81; CI 6.44, 28.32) . Several studies reported no significant increase in intussusception risk when looking at the second dose only,75 and following the second or third doses .102, 175, 236, 237 Finally, two studies83, 213 show ed an increase in the number of cases of intussusception at a population level following the introduction of rotavirus vaccine. A study83 of infants reported an upward trend in yearly intussusception- related surgery during 2006 to 2010 (+2 excess cases per 100,000 births per year; p =0.023) . Another study213 of infants in the United States found significantly elevated rates of intussusception in 2007 (40.7 per 100 000 children <12 months of age; RR 1.13; CI 1.07, 1.20) and in 2010 (40.3 per 100 000 children <12 months of age; RR 1.12; CI 1.06, 1.20) but also reported that in other postvaccine introduction years, intussusception rates were not significantly diffe rent from baseline before rotavirus vaccine introduction . Rotavirus vaccine s and death. Across fourteen RCTs,139, 161, 169, 909, 967, 969, 973, 1005, 1011, 1016, 1025, 1041, 1045, 1054 there was no evidence of increased risk of death (RR 1.05; CI 0. 82, 1.35) . All 1025, 1045, 1054 of these RCTs had fewer deaths in the vaccinated group than in the unvaccinated groups (with roughly equal sample sizes in each), and none of the six studies had statistically significant risk estimates on their own. In one of these RCTs, 1016 there was an imbalance of deaths due to pneumonia that was further investigated and determined not to be of concern. In two RCTs, 1011, 1045the causes of death were not specified but the study authors note that none were attributed to rotavirus vaccine. In another three RCT s,139, 1025, 1054 no death s in the vaccinated group were considered attributable to rotavirus vaccine (deaths were due to respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] bronchiolitis 36 days after dose 2 , gastroenteritis of unknown etiology and bronchopneumonia 46 days after last dose , bronchopneumonia 124 days after last dose, and pneumonia 16 days after dose 1). Rotavirus vaccine s and cardiovascular events. Across seven studies, 73, 161, 169, 909, 969, 988, 1045 the relative risk of cardiovascular events was not significant (RR 1.79; CI 1.00, 3.20), but the lower CI was 1.00. We note that this relative risk reflected multiple types of events and was driven by one study73 of rotavirus vaccine in premature infants who received RotaTeq and 77 experienced bradycardia (RR 1.87; CI 1.13, 3.10; 38/201 vs 20/198) . In general, bradycardia events in premature infants are mild and in this study were considered clinically insignificant by the authors . There was no evidence of increased incidence of sepsis evaluation or elevation in respiratory support, which further suggests that these bradycardic events were mild. Most importantly , the study's results were inconsistent as this finding was apparent only when comparing vaccine recipients to historic controls. In conducting a pre -post analysis in the same study, there was no difference in the proportion of infants experiencing an increa se in apnea and bradycardia events with and without stimulation in the week after rotavirus vaccination compared with the week prior. Moreover, in the same pre -post analysis, the total number of bradycardia imulation (882 vs 699, p=0.02) events was higher in the seven days before rotavirus vaccination than after vaccination (with none in the 1- and 3- day time periods). Finally, we note that many experts would consider the physiology of bradycardia in prematur e infants to be neurologic in nature rather than cardiovascular. Overall, this was a mild event that did not appear to be associated with more severe sequelae, and results within the same study using a different analytic approach varied. Adverse events in the other six studies occurred at a frequency of one or no excess events in each study, and included congestive heart failure, tachycardia, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, neonatal hypertension. Rotavirus vaccine s and febrile seizures or seizures. Across seven RCTs, 161, 169, 967, 969, 988, 1010, 1045 there was no evidence of increased risk of febrile seizures (RR 0. 82; CI 0. 33, 2.05) . Across five RCTs,169, 909, 967, 988, 1045 we found no evidence of increased risk of seizures ( RR 1.02; CI 0.25, 4.16). Although the RR was greater than 1, the event was rare and occurred more frequently in the vaccinated group in only two of the five studies ( 1/508 vs vs 0/2019). An additional study that reported insufficient detail for our analyses evaluated seizures among infants in Spain before and after rotavirus vaccine introduction found decreasing risk of hospitalizations for seizures following the introduction of rotavirus vaccine . 190 A self -controlled case series also found no association between rotavirus vaccine and seizures.235 Another study96 found no increased risk of febrile seizures during the first days following vaccination with rotavirus vaccine (RotaTeq) compared to a control period of 14 to 20 days (IRR 1.18; 0.47, 2.99). Other adverse events. Across five RCTs ,161, 169, 967, 988, 1045 there was no evidence of increased risk of asthma (RR 1. 33; CI 0. 65, 2.72) . The RR was greater than 1, but no risk estimates were statistically significant on their own and no studies noted t he severity of asthma or the nature of these events ( 5/508 vs another five RCTs.139, 161, 909, 988, 1045 there was no evidence of increased risk of meningitis (RR 1.18; CI 0.36, 3.89) , nor any statistically significant increased risk when the studies were considered alone . Two of the studies909, 1045 had fewer events in the vaccinated group ( 4/3744 vs 6/3745; 3/34904 vs 4/34862); two of the studies139, 161 had one event in each of the vaccinated and control groups ( 1/380 vs 0/381, 1/1666 vs 0/1667; one event was specified t o be due to coxsackie virus ); and one study988 had more cases in the vaccinated group with no further details provided (7/1647 vs 2/1641) . Across three studies,115, 225, 1045 we found no evidence of increased risk of diabetes (RR 0.74; CI 0.45, 1.22). A cohort study of rotavirus vaccine and type 1 diabetes found a 33 percent reduction in the risk of type 1 diabet es among those who complet ed the rotavirus vaccine series compared to those not vaccinated . 189 78 Across three RCTs,967, 1010, 1045 we found no evidence of increased risk of Kawasaki disease (RR 2.08; CI 0.04, 123); the risk estimate was imprecise as the studies were of disparate sizes and with few events (1/508 vs 1/257; 5/34904 vs 0/34862; 1/4359 vs 0/4328). One self - controlled case series analysis135 found no increased risk of Kawasaki disease in a primary analysis looking at 1 -28 days post -rotavirus vaccine, but found an increased risk following the first dose of Rotarix at 22 -28 days (IRR 1.98; CI 1.16, 3.40) and following the second dose of RotaTeq at 15-21 days (IRR 2.33; CI 1.35, 4.00). One pre -post study223 that took place in Germany reported no increase in Kawasaki disease- related hospitalizations after introduction of rotavirus vaccine . We found no evidence of increased risk of encephalitis/encephalopathy ( RR 0.67; CI 0.00, 1459247) across two RCTs.161, 1045 In all three cases, the risk estimates were imprecise as they were across only two studies and events were infrequent (encephalit is/encephalopathy 0/34962 and 1/1666 vs 1/667). A small study in Aichi prefecture in Japan found no increased risk of encephalitis/encephalopathy or sudden death following rotavirus vaccine by self -report before and after rotavirus vaccine introduction. 130 Across one RCT1045 and one cohort study,225 we found no evidence of increased risk of autoimmu ne disease ( RR 0.65; CI 0.16, 2.67). One RCT1045 noted an RR greater than 1 (RR 2.00; CI 0.07, 59.94) for reproductive system issues based on one case of testicular torsion in the intervention group ( 1/34904 vs 0/34862), resulting in an imprecise risk estimate. We identified one study62 assessing rotavirus vaccine (RotaT eq) in children and adults in the Vaccine Safety Datalink population (presumably rotavirus vaccine was only administered to children, but the study did not specify) . The study reported no increased risk of transverse myelitis (which was the only adverse event studied for rotavirus vaccine [Rota Teq]) in the 5- to 28-day risk interval following vaccination of versus the remainder of the nine months after vaccination. Varicella Vaccine We identified two self-controlled risk interval analyse s,96, 235 and one case control study158 assessing varicella vaccine in children in this update . Studies assessed Varivax158 and varicella vaccine with brand not otherwise specified235 (study utilized administrative data to determine varicella vaccination status). One self -controlled risk interval analysis235 from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (1995 -2015) found no increased risk of seizures following administration of va ricella vaccine (IRR 0.8; CI 0.6, 1.0), controlling for concomitant vaccines. A related and overlapping case series of children also from the Vaccine Safety Datalink population (2004- 2008) reported an increased risk of seizures following varicella vaccinat ion at 12 to 15 months (IRR 2.75; CI 2.05, 3.70), as well as at 16 to 23 months (IRR 3.64; CI 1.86, 7.12) . However, varicella vaccine was likely to have been given concurrently with MMR in this study, which was not controlled for (unlike the prior, larger study of the same population 235). Another study96 looking at febrile seiz ures specifically found no increased risk during the first day following vaccination compared to a control period of 14 to 20 days (IRR 0.80; 0.45, 1.42); however, the risk interval may have been too soon after vaccination to detect a risk. 79 One study158 reported no association with a di agnosis of broken bone, open wound, obsessive -compulsive disorder, anorexia, tic disorder, attention deficit hyperactive disorder, major depression, or bipolar disorder. We identified two studies62, 63 of children and adults reporting on varicella vaccine (presumed to be Varivax as it took place in the United States). In one study,62 the authors reported no increased risk of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (aOR 4.3; CI 0.5, 25.4) , 0.0; CI 0 ( 0.0, 10.7) in the short term interval following vaccines versus the remainder of the nine months after vaccination. In a second study,63 there was no association between sudden sensorineural hearing loss and varicella vaccine within one week of vaccination (OR 0; CI 0, 155.27). Combination Vaccines This section is subdivided according to the different combination vaccines. DTaP-IPV-Hib-HepB We identified three RCTs70, 166, 211 assessing the new hexavalent combination vaccine DTaP- IPV-Hib-HepB. All three RCTs compared D TaP-IPV-Hib-HepB to the older combination vaccine DTaP -IPV/Hib plus HepB as well as other routine vaccines received by both intervention and control groups. Across three studies,70, 166, 211 there was no evidence of increased risk associated with DTaP- IPV-Hib-HepB, including for death ( RR 0.9 0; CI 0. 02, 45.23) and febrile seizures (RR 0.71 CI 0.03, 19.74) . Across two studies,70, 166 there was no evidence of increased risk of asthma ( RR 0.68; CI 0.00, 222465); the risk estimate was imprecise due to studies of differing sizes, both with few e vents (1/2390 vs 0/397 and 2/983 vs 1/480). Across the same two studies, there was no evidence of increased risk of meningitis (RR 0.42; CI 0.00, 462552) ; again, the risk estimate was imprecise due to one or no cases in each study (1/2390 vs 0/397 and 1/98 0 vs 1/483). One study70 found a statistically insignificant reduc tion in the risk of diabetes, intussusception, and i diopathic thrombocytopenic purpura . A second study166 reported a statistically insignificant reduc tion in the risk of Kawasaki disease. DTaP-HepB- IPV We identified one pre -post study90 and one self -controlled risk interval a nalysis96 that assessed DTaP-HepB- IPV in children in this update . In the pre -post study,90 the authors reported that in a population of extremely low birth weight infants in the neonatal intensive care unit, the three -day period following DTaP-HepB- IPV vaccination was associated with an increase in incidence of sepsis evaluation (adjusted rate ratio 4.3; CI 3.6, 5.3) , respiratory support (adjusted rate ratio 2.6; CI 2.1, 3.1) , and intubation incidence (adjusted r ate ratio 1.8; CI 1.3, 2.6) compared with the three day period prior to D TaP-HepB- IPV vaccination. The authors also noted that true bacteremia (sepsis) occurred rarely both bef ore and after vaccination. A self - controlled risk interval analysis 96 looking at febrile seizures among children aged 6 to 23 months found no incre ased risk during the first day following vaccination compared to a control period of 14 to 20 days (IRR 1.64; 0.62, 4.35). One case- centered analysis62 in children and adults assessed D TaP-HepB -IPV. The study reported no increased risk of transverse myelitis in the 5 - to 28 -day risk interval following vaccination versus the remainder of the nine months after vaccination. None of the identified studies reported sufficient data to allow for further analyses such as an independent assessment of the relative risk. 80 DTaP-IPV/Hib We identifi ed one observational retrospective study,126 one self -controlled risk interval analysis,96 one cohort study,174 and one pre -post study90 assessing D TaP-IPV/Hib in children in this update . All studies except for one assessed Pentacel ; the one study90 did not identify the specific brand name of the D TaP-IPV/Hib vaccine used in the study (vaccination status was determine d using administrative data). Three of the studies used a self -controlled design90, 96, 126 and the fourth174 compared DTaP -IPV/Hib to DTaP -containing vaccines in use prior to its introduction. The observational retrospective cohort study126 compared rates of outcomes during the post - vaccination risk interval with rates from a comparison interval for all non -elective hospitalizations, and all outcomes in the emergency department setting , and found no safety concerns. The study examined pre -specified outcomes in the outpatient setting, including Guillain -Barr\u00e9 purpura [ITP], hemolytic anemia), type 1 diabetes, and Kawasaki disease, but as none of these outcomes had an elevated risk following vaccination they were not further assessed with any sort of comparator as part of the risk -interval analysis (and thus are not included in analyses for this report). One study 96 looking at febrile seizures specifically found no increased risk duri ng the first day following vaccination compared to a control period of 14 to 20 days (IRR 0.72; 0.13, 3.85). The cohort study174 reported that n o cases of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome, anaphylaxis, or invasive Hib disease occurred among D TaP-IPV/Hib recipients during the study period, and the study reported no increased risk in serious allergic reaction (OR 1; CI 0.34, 2.99) , encephalitis (OR 0.78; ( 0.91; CI 0.52, 1.57) , or hospitalizations (OR 0.87; CI 0.73, 1.04) but the study reported events per dose rather than per participant, and the concurrent control group received DTaP as an individual injection. The authors of the pre -post study 90 reported that in a population of extremely low birth weight infants in the neonatal intensive care unit, D TaP-IPV/Hib vaccination was associated with an increase in incidence of sepsis evaluation (adjusted rate ratio 4.0; CI 2.3, 6.9) and respiratory support ( adjusted rate ratio 2.3; CI 1.3, 4.0); as noted previously, very few cases of true bacteremia (sepsis) occurred either pre or post vaccination. One case- centered analysis62 in children and adults also evaluated D TaP-IPV/Hib. The study reported no increased risk of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in the 5 - to 28- day risk interval interval following vaccination versus the remainder of the nine months after vaccination. DTaP-IPV We identified one pre -post study88 assessing D TaP-IPV (Kinrix\u00ae) among children in this update (and none of Quadracel\u00ae). Among eight pre -specified events (meningitis/encephalitis/myelitis, seizures, stroke, Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome, anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema and other non- anaphylactic allergic reactions, and serious local reactions), there was no increased risk compared to historical incidence rates. One case- centered analysis62 in children and adults reported no increased risk of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis associated with D TaP-IPV (Kinrix) in the 5 - to 28- day ri sk interval interval following vaccination versus the remainder of the nine months after vaccination. 81 MMR -V We identified one RCT ,89 two self-controlled risk interval analys es,96, 167 and cohort and varicella -V) in in this update . All studies assessed the ProQuad\u00ae vaccine. An RCT89 comparing MMR -V with a hexavalent vaccine to hexavalent vaccine alone identified two participants with febrile seizures in the intervention arm compared to none in the control arm. B oth participants had concomitant infections and the difference was not statistically significant (RR 2.02; CI 0.09, 44.55) . A cohort study148 comparing children aged 12 to 23 months who received MMR -V to those who received MMR and varicella vaccine separately on the same day, reported an increased risk of febrile seizures (RR 1.98; CI 1.43, 2.73) during the seven to ten days following vaccination that was similar when looking only at chart -confirmed febrile seizures. The authors calculated that the excess risk for febrile seizures 7 to 10 days after MMR -V compared with separate MMR and varicella vaccination was 4.3 p er 10,000 doses ( CI 2.6, 5.6) . Another study 96 looking at febrile seizures specifically found no increased risk during the first day following vac cination compared to a control period of 14 to 20 days (IRR 1.12; CI 0.49, 2.54). Of note, fever and the risk of febrile seizures tends to be later with vaccines such as MMR -V, so the risk interval was likely to have been too soon after vaccination to dete ct a risk. In addition, two of these studies overlapped in terms of the population studied (Vaccine Safety datalink) and time frame (2000 -2008 for one study 148 and 2006- 2011 for the other96). For seizures, which were not differentiated from febrile seizures, a self -controlled risk interval analysis167 comparing the risk during the seven to ten days follow ing MMR -V vaccination to a control window of 15 to 42 days found significantly increased risk of seizures both in children who had been born full -term ( IRR 5.7; CI 4.1, 7.8) and pre -term (IRR 7.9; CI 3.0, 20) . Another cohort study 149 compared risk of seizures following MMR -V in a number of ways, including through unadjusted risk differences, case -centered analysis comparing MMR -V to itself, and a case -centered analysis comparing MMR -V to MMR and varicella vaccine separat ely. All analyses showed an increased risk of seizures, with an adjusted RR of 1.99 (CI 1.08, 3.52) reported by the authors among children, as well as risk of fever. The authors of both of the studies of MMR -V and seizures note that based on prior analyses , the majority of seizures were presumed to be febrile seizures. Again, both of these studies overlapped in terms of the population studied (Vaccine Safety datalink) and time frame (2000- 2012 for one study 149 and 2003 to 2015 for the other167). The same cohort study149 also compared idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura was elevated in the secondary analysis comparing MMR -V to itself (RR 11.28; CI 1.87, 68.2). Anaphylaxis risk was increased in the same secondary analysis based on two cases, but on chart review the two cases were confirmed not to be anaphylaxis. Another study 62 that included both children and adults also reported no increased risk of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis associated with MMR -V (ProQuad) in the 5- to 28- day risk interval interval following vaccination versus the remainder of the nine months after vaccination. 82 KQ2c3. For each adverse event associated with a particular vaccine, what are the risk factors for the adverse event? No adverse events were significantly associated with a vaccine in our meta- analyses, but we discuss any risk factors that were examined for adverse events below. Rotavirus Vaccine s In one study73 of rotavirus vaccine, the relative risk of cardiovascular events was largely driven by bradycardia events in a study of premature infants who received Rota Teq, an important subpopulation. Another study139 note d that premature infants and term infants had a comparable incidence of adverse events following administration of rotavirus vaccines . Some other rotavirus studies included subgroup analyses as well, with almost all looking at age as a risk factor or at results stratified by age group . In one study83 that compared intussusception before and after rotavirus vaccine introduction, results were reported separately for three age groups. T here was a 2 -fold higher rate of intussusception among six to 14 week - olds i n 2006 to 2010 compared with the 2000 to 2005 time period [IRR 1.90; CI 1.33, 2.74) . A statistically significant difference between the last 2 periods was also detected for the 33 to 52 weeks of age subgroup; however, when the narrower 33 to 40 weeks age subgroup was considered, no difference was seen in the risk of intussusception among time periods . This is in keeping with other studies75, 102, 135, 175, 208, 236, 237 that noted higher risk of intussusception after dose 1 (typically given to younger infants) compared to doses 2 and/ or 3. In a study213 of infants in the United States that found significantly elevated rates of intussusception in some years after rotavirus vaccine introduction, no consistent change in intussusception hospitalization rates was observed among all children under 12 months of age and among chil dren 15 to 24 weeks and 25 to 34 weeks of age. The intussusception hospitalization rate for children aged 8 to 11 weeks was significantly elevated by 46 to 101 percent in all postvaccine years except 2011 and 2013 compared with the pre -vaccine baseline, further indicating that risk for intussusception after rotavirus vaccine may be age- related . However, a study 131 of the Canadian population that found no increase in incidence of intussusception following implementation of universal rotavirus (Rotarix) immunization programs also found no difference when limiting the age of intussuscept ion incidence to infants two to eight months, and then further limiting it to infants two to six months and two to four months . A study in England 168 that examined admission rates for intussusception before and after introduction of rotavirus vacc ine found no overall increase in hospital admission rate or disease severity, but found an increase in the admission rate in the 8- 16 weeks age group (RR 1.46; CI 1.12, 1.91) that was compensated for by decreases in the 17 to 24 weeks (RR 0.77; CI 0.63, 0.94), 25 to 32 weeks (RR 0.71; CI 0.59, 0.86) and 41 to 52 weeks (RR 0.80; CI 0.66, 0.98) age groups. A case- control study175 from Germany found that age at the start of rotavirus vaccine series did not modify the risk of intussusception . In studies looking at the association of rotavirus vaccination and risk of type 1 diabetes, one study189 found no statistically significant effect of year of birth and gender . A cohort study115 that assessed the association between rotavirus vaccine and type 1 diabetes reported no increased risk among children partially exposed to rotavirus vaccine (aHR 1.03; CI 0.62, 1.72) or children fully exposed to all recommended doses of rotavirus vaccin e (aHR 1.50; CI 0.81, 2.77) compared with children unexposed to rotavirus vaccination ; there were also no differences by age and vaccine brand. A study133 that found no risk of convulsions among children who received rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix) and IPV compared to those who received IPV alone showed no difference in the lack of risk when assessed by any dose, after the first dose, or after the second dose . Finally, 83 in a study155 looking at a number of adverse events including otitis media, there was an association between otitis media and the second dose of rotavirus vaccine ( HR 1.11; CI 1.08, 1.15), which was consistent across sex, region of the United States , and time period; this association was less pronounced with RotaTeq compared to Rotarix (HR 0.92; CI 0.89, 0.95) . Other Vaccines A number of studies examined potential risk factors for adverse events associated with other vaccines. One study235 that assessed th e risk of seizures with varicella vaccine given concomitantly with other vaccines, including MMR , found that the risk seven to ten days after vaccination increased with age, from an IRR of 2.75 (CI 2.05, 3.70) at age 12 to 15 months to 3.64 (CI 1.86, 7.12) when administered at 16 to 23 months of age . In the same study, both MMR (IRR 2.65; CI 1.99, 3.55 at 12- IRR 6.35; CI 9.80; CI 4.35, 22.06 at 16- 23 months) were associated with increasing risk of seizures by age . A study353 of measles -containing vaccines (including MMR -V) found lower increased risk of seizures when administered at 12 -15 months of age compared to 16 -23 months of age. A study167 examining the risk of seizures found no significant difference in the risk of seizures for children who had been born pre -term compared to full -term for MMR ( IRR 1.2; CI 0.70, 2.0) 1.4 ; CI 0.51, 3.8) . Two studies examined risk factors for MMR and autism. A cohort study138 in Denmark found no increased risk for autism , and this finding was consistently observed in subgroups of children defined according to sibling history of autism, autism risk factors based on a disease risk score , or receipt of other childhood vaccinations . Another study141 found that receipt of the MMR was not associated with increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) , regardless of whether older siblings had ASD . A case- control study224 of MMR and autism found no increased risk of autism and no difference in the risk of autism following MMR at any age. A study174 of D TaP-IPV/Hib that found no increased risk of medically attended fever, seizure, meningitis/encephalitis/myelitis, non -anaphylactic serious allergic reaction, anaphylaxis, Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome, or invasive Hib disease did identify an increased risk of medically attended fever among 1 - to 2-year-olds who received D TaP-IPV/Hib vaccine versus historical comparators (RR 1.83; CI 1.34, 2.50) but not among infants under 1 year old (RR 0.83; CI 0.73, 0.94) . Five studies examined risk factors associated with PCV13 and adverse events. Two RCTs55, 217 examined safety after both the infant and toddler doses, and found that PCV13 has an acceptable safety profile in both toddlers and infants , including one study217 in which PCV13 was co -administered with D TaP. A pre -post study221 of PCV13 compared to PCV7 that assessed pre-specified adverse events found no risk associated with PCV13, with no difference among age-stratified analyses. In a study206 comparing fever in children who received PCV13 and trivalent IIV versus trivalent IIV alone, the finding that PCV13 and trivalent IIV were associated with higher rates of fever did not change when excluding children whose families reported antipyretic use on days 0 to 1 or when analyses were limited to first enrollments (children could enroll for more than one vaccination event; this analysis was restricted to their first enrollment in the study) . Another study of PCV1359 found higher risk of febrile seizur es when administered with IIV (IRR 4.83) than when given alone (IRR 1.54; CI 1.04, 2.28) . The study included a mix of trivalent and quadrivalent IIV. 84 Two studies assess risk factors for MenB and adverse events in children . One RCT186 examined different doses of the vaccine , including the approved dose , and found all doses to be well tolerated . Another RCT196 found that local reactions and systemic events did not increase with concomitant administration of other vaccines. A self -controlled cases series study127 of MenACWY -D (Menactra) that assessed multiple outcomes stratified by age groups (2 -10 years and 9- 23 months). The only significantly elevated outcome was among 2-10- year-olds (two cases of cellulitis/abscess occurred during the risk interval versus none during comparison interval; after medical record review, the cases were considered unrelated to vaccination) . Four studies of influenza vaccines in children looked at risk fact ors for particular subgroups. A study129 of quadrivalent IIV (Flucelvax Quadrivalent ) stratified children into age groups of 4 to 5 years, 6 to 8 years, and 9 to 17 years, and found no major differences in non- serious and non-severe adverse events by age. A study160 of all quadrivalent IIV (brand not specified) found an increased risk of febrile seizures when administering quadrivalent IIV with PCV 13 and other vaccines (RR 12.3; 58.90), not for 0.12, 11.20) . A study76 of LAIV in children with asthma and high- risk conditions found no increased risk of hospitalization. A second study207 of quadrivalent LAIV in children found no difference in fever when looking at those who received quadrivalent LAIV alone, when assessing only children aged 3 years and older, or when race/ethnicity or the presence of a high -risk medical condition w ere added to the model . Among studies that included both adults and children, three reported sub -group analyses. In a study61 of quadrivalent LAIV versus IIV, the authors analyzed risk for different age groups , separately as well as by history of wheezing. Compared to other age groups, children aged two to four years had significantly lower risk of wheezing (aHR 0.67; CI 0.48, 0.92), lower respiratory tract infection (aHR 0.69; 0.51, 0.93), and hospitalization (aHR 0.39; CI 0.18, 0.87) w ith LAIV than those who received IIV. This effect was not observed for the within -cohort analysis that looked at these outcomes pre - and post -vaccine , nor when comparing LAIV to no vaccine (both aHR < 1). Children aged five to nine years who received LAIV had lower risk of lower respiratory tract infection (aHR 0.55; CI 0.39, 0.79) and hospitalization (aHR 0.12; CI 0.03, 0.54) than those who received IIV and lower risk of hospitalization (aHR 0.14; CI 0.03, 0.63) than those who received no vaccine. Adolescents aged 9 to 17 years had lower risk of wheezing (aHR 0.51; CI 0.27, 0.96) and lower respiratory tract infection (0.57; CI 0.35, 0.93) w hen comparing LAIV to IIV. Among adults aged 18 to 49 years, LAIV was associated with significant decrease in risk of hospitalization when compar ed to no vaccine (aHR 0.33; CI 0.13, 0.87) and compared to IIV ( aHR 0.13; CI 0.06, 0.30) , except for the within cohort analysis. Among children with a history of wheezing or asthma, LAIV was associated with significantly less wheezing than was IIV (aHR 0.25; CI 0.04, 0.96), but the result was not significant when LAIV was compared to no vacci ne (aHR 0.45; CI 0.06, 2.12). When looking specifically at wheezing among children aged 2-4 years of age with a history of wheezing or asthma, there was no difference in effects associated with LAIV versus IIV . In this study, quadrivalent LAIV was not asso ciated with any increased risk of the adverse events examined. The recent studies of HPV9 resulted in a number of additional publications that pooled together multiple RCT s to assess safety by geographic region and gender. Two studies that were secondary a nalyses of one of the RCT s 136 looked specifically at participants in Asian countrie s256 and in Latin American countries354 and identified no new safety concerns. In a study220 of MenACWY -CRM (Menveo), the only significant finding was a reported association with Bell 's palsy (relative incidence 2.9; CI 1.1, 7.5) . Stratified analyses 85 demonstrated the increased risk only in pa rticipants receiving concomitant vaccines ( RI 5.0; CI 1.4, 17.8), and no increased risk for those without concomitant vaccine ( RI 1.1; CI 0.2, 5.5). KQ2 : Summary of Findings for Safety of Vaccines in Children This section summarizes the findings across studies and safety of vaccines for children or children and adults for the pre -defined key adverse event s. The section is stratified by vaccine type. The summary of findings tables document the results across studies grouped by vaccines. These tables show the number of RCTs, the number of other studies, the number of participants across pooled analyses, the studies contributing to the risk estimate, findings for the outcomes of interest, the criteria used to downgrade the SoE, and the SoE summary statement. The relative risk of an adverse event was derived by comparing the reported event rates in vaccinated participants compared to a control group ac ross all studies that reported the data for that outcome. The absolute rates of adverse events (number of events, number of assessed participants) for the vaccine and the control group are also shown. In many instances, results were based on single occurrences of a specific adverse event. Where studies reported insufficient detail and did not contribute to the effect size estimates, the tables report the results as reported by the study authors. Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Acellular Pertussis Vaccines The summ ary of findings Table 11 documents the findings across studies of vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (including D TaP and Tdap) .

These findings remain unchanged with no new findings from this report (childhood leukemia was not examined as an outcome, and there were no studies on type 1 diabetes and D TaP or Tdap ; Td no longer in use in children). The prior 2014 report found insufficient evidence for an association between acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, autism, cerebellar ataxia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, infantile spasms, multiple sclerosis relapse, serum sickness, sudden infant death syndrome, and transverse myelitis and DTaP/Tdap/Td based on the IOM report alone ; these findings remain unchanged as the update either identified no new studies or the evidence continued to be insufficient . For DTaP, the update found no evidence of increased risk of asthma or death (low SoE). T he evidence was graded as insufficient or there were no new studies for several other key adverse event s. For Tdap, the update found no evidence of increased risk of cardiovascular events or death (low SoE) . There was either insufficient evidence or no new studies fo r several other key adverse event s.

There were no studies of this outcom e in the update , and the finding remains unchanged The evidence was either graded as insufficient or there were no new studies for several other key adverse events. HepB . The prior 2014 report found high SoE for no association of hepatitis B vaccine and childhood leukemia based on m ultiple large epidemiological studies ; this outcome was not examined as a key adverse event in the current report and the finding remains unchanged. The prior 2014 report concluded insufficient SoE for statements regarding food allergy ; this outcome was also not examined as a key adverse event in the current report .

The prior 2014 report indicated insufficient SoE for evidence statements regarding the presence or absence of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, transverse myelitis, neuromyelitis optica, multiple spontaneous abortion, and hypercoagulable states . However, all of the evidence review was for HPV2 and HPV4, which are no longer in use.

The prior 2014 report c LAIV and IIV , and quadrivalent LAIV was not reviewed in the prior 2014 report (only trivalent LAIV ). The prior 2014 report showed low SoE for increased risk of influenza -like symptoms with trivalent LAIV . There was also low SoE for no association with any serious adverse events in the short term in children with cancer (not examined as a key adverse event in current report). There was insufficient evidence for asthma exacerbation (LAIV specifically) and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or transverse myelitis (all influenza vaccines assessed together). Trivalent LAIV, which was the subject of the prio r 2014 report, is no longer in use.

The prior 2014 report found moderate SoE supporting a causal relationship between MMR and transient arthralgia , which was based on mechanistic evidence from the IOM report ; the estimate of the magnitude of increased risk was not determined . This finding remains unchanged as it was not examined as a key adverse event in the current report . The prior 2014 report found moderate SoE for a rare association with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura among children based on post -marketing studies (no summary risk estimate could be calculated); this finding also remains unchanged as there were no studies of this outcome in the update. The update found low SoE for no evidence of increased risk of asthma. The prior 20 14 report found insufficient evidence for evidence statements regarding encephalitis, afebrile seizures, meningitis, optica, multiple sclerosis onset, and chronic arthropathy. These findings remain unchanged as the update either did not find studies examining these outcomes, did not include these outcomes as key adverse events, or the new evidence w as graded as insufficient ( for acute disseminated enc ephalomyelitis , optic neuritis , and transverse myelitis ). There were also several key adverse events for which there were no studies.

The prior 2014 report found moderate SoE supporting a causal relationship between MenACWY and anaphylaxis in children with allergies , based on mechanistic evidence from the IOM report; the estimate of the magnitude of increased risk was not determined . In the update , there wa s low SoE for no evidence of increased risk of anaphylaxis or systemic allergic reaction among all children (not restricted to those with allergies to the vaccine) based on two studies. 112 The prior 2014 report found insufficient evidence for encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, transverse myelitis, multiple sclerosis, Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and chronic headache. The following outcomes were upgraded t o low SoE for no evidence of increased risk based on new studies identified in the update: acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, encephalitis/ encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, atory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and chronic headache remained insufficient, either because the evidence was graded as insufficient (as for Guillain -Barr\u00e9 s yndrom e) or because the outcomes were not included as key adverse events. The update also found moderate SoE for no evidence of increased risk for cardiovascular events, diabetes, febrile seizures, intussusception, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, Kawasaki disease, or seizures. The update found low SoE for no evidence of increased risk of asthma, autoimmune disease, death, meningitis, or reproductive system events. The evidence was graded as insufficient evidence or there were no studies for several other key adverse events. MenB. Men B was not in use at the time of the prior 2014 report. The current report found moderate SoE for n o evidence of increased risk for anaphylaxis or systemic allergic reaction or reproductive system event s, and low SoE for n o evidence of increased risk for as thma , death , or seizures. The evidence was graded as insufficient or there were no studies for several other key adverse event s. Table 18a summarizes the findings across the prior 2014 report and the update . Table 18a.

The update identified six studies with conflicting evide nce around the risk of febrile seizures ( graded as low SoE for no evidence of increased risk). Thus, the original finding was downgraded from moderate to low SoE for an increased risk of febrile seizures. The update found moderate SoE for no evidence of i ncreased risk for death (most studies compared PCV13 to PCV7). The update also found low SoE for no evidence of increased risk for asthma, cardiovascular events, intussusception, meningitis , reproductive system events, or seizures (all compared PCV13 to PCV7). The update found insufficient evidence for several other key adverse events, and no studies for others . PPSV23 . There were no studies of PPSV23 in children in the prior 2014 report. In the update , the evidence was either graded as insufficient or there were no studies ; thus, there was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions .

Some, but not all, observational studies showed increased risk of intussusception, particularly following the first dose of rotavirus vaccine. Taking all of the evidence together, the current report found moderate SoE for no risk of intussusception with rotavirus vaccine at the time of latest follow -up (SoE downgraded due to mixed results from observational studies that could not be combined) . The update found high SoE for no evidence of increased risk of diabetes, and moderate SoE for no evidence of increased risk for asthma, autoimmune disease, death, encephalitis/ encephalopathy, febrile seizures, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura . The update found low SoE for no evidence of increased risk of anaphylaxis or systemic allergic reaction , autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease), Kawasaki disease, meningitis , or reproductive system events .

All of these findings remain unchanged, as there are no studies addressing these outcomes in the update . 125 The prior 2014 report also found moderate strength evidence of a rare association with thrombocytopenic purpura among children aged 11 to 17 years based on one large epidemiological study (no summary risk estimate could be calculated) ; this finding remains unchanged given that no ne w studies of this outcome were identified in this report. At the time of the prior 2014 report, there was insufficient evidence regarding seizures, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, transverse myelitis, Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome, small exacerbation of arthropathy, and thrombocytopenia. SoE for these findings remains insufficient as new evidence was either graded as insufficient (for s eizures, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and transverse myelitis ), there were no studies, or the outcome was not included as a key adverse event.

The current report found low SoE for no evidence of increased risk for asthma, death, febrile seizures, or meningitis, and evidence was graded insuff icient for other outcomes. There were also no studies for several key adverse events. DTaP-HepB -IPV. The prior 2014 report did not identif y studies of DTaP -HepB- IPV and the update either found insufficient evidence or no new studies; thus, there wa s insuff icient evidence to draw conclusions . DTaP -IPV/Hib. The prior 2014 report found moderate strength evidence of an association of DTaP -IPV/Hib with febrile seizures based on one large, high quality post licensure study. This finding has been downgraded to insufficient taking into account both available studies (as there was a second study i dentified in this report with no evidence of increased risk) . The update found low SoE for n o evidence of increased risk for anaphylaxis or systemic allergic reaction . DTaP -IPV. The prior 2014 report did not report findings related to DTaP -IPV. The update found l ow SoE for n o evidence of increased risk for encephalitis /encephalopathy. Evidence was graded as insufficient or there were no studie s for other key adverse events . MMR -V. The prior 2014 report did not report findings related to MMR -V. The update found low SoE of no evidence of increased risk of encephalitis /encephalopathy and death.

This section describes the evidence for the safety of vaccines routinely recommended for use in pregnant women, both in the pregnant women and their fetuses/infants . Key Points Insufficient evidence to permit evidence statements on hepatitis B vaccine, inactivated influenza vaccines, or recombinant influenza vaccine in pregnant women . Tetanus, dipht heria, and acellular pertussis vaccine: N o evidence of increased riskd for maternal cardiovascular events, maternal death , maternal diabetes, eclampsia /pre- eclampsia, preterm labor, maternal reproductive system events, stillbirth, cardiovascular events in infants, death in infants , encephalitis/ encephalopathy in infants , or seizures in d \"No evidence of increased risk\" indicates that the outcome was studied and that the findings of the studies did not constitute evidence of increased risk of the adverse event following adm inistration of that vaccine (because the risk either was not statistically significantly increased or was reduced) . 134 infants (moderate SoE) . No evidence of increased risk of maternal encephalitis/encephalopathy , autism in infants , birth defects in infants , or febrile seizures in infant s (low SoE). KQ3a. What adverse events are collected in clinical studies and in observational studies containing a control/comparison group? Given the large number of adverse events that have been collected in the included studies, the table of collected adverse events is shown in Appendix C. The table lists both prespecified and incidentally collected, adverse events. The information comes fro m a variety of experimental and observational designs. Details of the studies , including the method used to assess adverse events, are documented in the evidence tables (Appendix D) and the risk of bias tables (Appendix C) . Adverse events are shown in alphabetical order to facilitate the comparison across vaccines. Studies collected adverse events for pregnant women and their infants /fetuses peri -and post - partum. The table lists the adverse events verbatim as reported in the original studies. As shown, the assessed adverse events varied greatly in detail as well as content. The collected data encompass the range of mild and transient events to serious adverse events with permanent consequences. KQ3b. What adverse events are reported in clinical studies and i n observational studies containing a control/comparison group? The evidence tables in Appendix D contain all serious and severe adverse events reported in studies of pregnant women and their fetuses/infants . KQ3c. What adverse events are associated with these vaccines in pregnant women? This section further characterizes the risk of adverse events identified in studies of pregnant women who received routinely recommended vaccines. KQ3c1. For each adverse event associated with a particular vaccine, what is the average severity and frequency? No studies of key adverse events in pregnant women using HepB , quadrivalent IIV or quadrivalent RIV were found in this update . The prior 2014 report identified only evaluations of trivalent IIV and monovalent H1N1 influenza vaccine, which are no longer in use. We did not detect any significant associations with adverse events following Tdap in pregnant women. KQ3c2. For adverse event s without statistically significant associations with a particular vaccine, what is the range of possible effects? Below we report all pooled risk estimates for adverse events that were reported on by more than one study. We note any instances where individual studies contributing to a pooled risk estimate were statistically significant on their own, indicating increased risk of an adverse event. We also report on studies with risk estimates that could not be computed and pooled statistically. Finally, as for KQ1 and KQ2, we summarize the range of possible effects by vaccine in brief below for all adverse events for which the primary relative risk estimate did not favor the 135 intervention (i.e., RR>1), but the association was not statistically significant. Where appropriate, we contextualize the finding to understand the range of possible ef fects. Hepatitis B Vaccine s in Pregnant Women We did not identify any studies that assessed adverse events associated with HepB, in pregnant women in this update or in our original report. Influenza Vaccines in P regnant Women We did not identify any studies that assessed key adverse events associated with quadrivalent IIV or any studies of quadrivalent RIV in pregnant women in this update. One study of active surveillance used automated text messaging to identify adverse events following Tdap or IIV (of which >95% were quadrivalent IIV) among pregnant women in Australia.116 When comparing IIV plus Tdap to Tdap alone, there was no significant difference in women seeking medical advice via telephone for adverse events (RR 1.38; CI 0.60, 3.20) or being medically attended for adverse events (RR 1.79; CI 0.79, 4.04). Tdap in Pregnant Women We identified four RCTs125, 172, 179, 181 and 13 cohort studies52, 64, 65, 67, 91, 121, 123, 144, 154, 170, 182, 191, 198 that assessed adverse events in pregnant women and/ or their offspring among women who received Tdap. RCTs assessed Adacel125, 172, 179 or Boostrix ;181 in most cases, the vaccine(s) used for women followed in the cohort studies were not specified. Three of the RCTs172, 179, 181 were placebo controlled, and one RCT125 compared Tdap to Td . We did not separate out the one study that compared Tdap and Td in reporting results, as Tdap is sufficiently different from Td given the acellular pertussis component . The other studies used participants not vaccinated with Tdap as cont rol groups. Two studies52, 179 did not contribute to the meta -analyses as key adverse events were not reported; however, neither study found significant difference in maternal adverse events overall and one study 52 that also looked at infants found no diff erence in adverse events. Across ten studies,67, 121, 123, 125, 170, 172, 181, 182, 191, 198 we found no evidence of increased risk of preterm labor; women who received Tdap were at significantly lower risk for preterm labor (RR 0.62; CI 0.46, 0.82) (I2 85%). Across six studies,121, 123, 125, 154, 181, 191 we found no evidence of increased risk of eclampsia/pre - eclampsia (RR 0.96; CI 0.92, 1.01); there evidence of publication bias (Egger p=0.063, Begg p=0.272). Across another six studies,67, 170, 172, 181, 191, 198 there was no evidence of increased risk of stillbirth (RR 0.44 ; CI 0.11, 1.80). Across another six studies,121, 125, 144, 172, 181, 191 there was no evidence of increased risk of cardiovascular disorders (RR 0.8 6; CI 0. 41, 1.84); there was considerable heterogeneity (I2 85%). Of note, one of the studies121 reported an increased risk of cardiovascular events (gestational hyperten sion; RR 1.30; CI 1.15, 1.48; events 262/8178 vs 1484/60372) ; however, the authors noted that the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) was no longer significant ( aHR 1.02; CI 0.88, 1.19) . Across four studies,121, 125, 181, 191 we found no evidence of increased risk fo r maternal deaths (RR 1.52; CI 0. 07, 32.35). Although the RR was greater than 1, it is important to note that no deaths occurred in the intervention groups \u2014one death occurred in a control group and the RR was inflated due to an imbalance in the sample sizes after adding a constant for computational purposes. Across another four studies,121, 144, 181, 191 we found no evidence of increased risk of diabetes (RR 0.98; CI 0.88, 1.10). Across three studies, 125, 181, 191 we found no evidence of increased risk 136 of reproductive system events (RR 0.52 CI 0.05, 5.91); we detected statistical heterogeneity (I2 53%). Across two studies,123, 198 we found no evidence of increased risk of spontaneous abortion (RR 0.66; CI 0.00, 1004) ; we detected statistical heterogeneity despite the small number of studies (I2 81%). The risk estimate was imprecise as it was based on two studies of disparate size (4/138 vs 49/552 and 233/1252 vs 22931/130289). Among other maternal outcomes, a cohort study reported that women who received Tdap had a decreased risk (adjusted) for caesarean delivery (aO R 0.78; CI 0.63, 0.98).67 One cohort study121 identified a n increased risk of lactation disorders (aHR 1.63; CI 1.15, 2.33) , but significantly decreased risk of antenatal bleeding (aHR 0.61; CI 0.49, 0.78) as well as pre - eclampsia with severe features and preterm labor /delivery ( already captured in meta -analyses ). In another cohort study,154 there was increased risk of post -partum hemorrhage both among those with optimally timed Tdap (a HR 1.23; CI 1.18, 1.28) and early Tdap (a HR 1.34; CI 1.25, 1.44) . However, in another study181 which was an RCT, there was no increased risk of vaginal or intrauterine hemorrhage following Tdap (2.6% ; CI 1.2, 5.0 vs 2.9%; CI 1.4, 5.3) . Among five cohort studies that assessed the risk for chorioamnionitis, two reported a slightly increased risk \u2014one study91 among 197,564 women (a djusted rate ratio 1.23; CI 1.17, 1.28) and one study154 among 1,079,034 women (aHR 1.11; CI 1.07, 1.15) who received optimally timed Tdap . One study121 of 68,550 women noted no difference in risk (aHR 1.10; CI 0.70, 1.75) , as did a second study170 that looked at 7,378 women who had received one dose of Tdap (6% vs 4%, p=0.31) . Finally, one study67 reported no difference in risk when evaluated in multiple ways among 1,759 women. One study125 assessed maternal autoimmune disease following Tdap and found a RR greater than 1 (RR 1.02; CI 0.06, 16.18) due to one event in each group of either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. An other study144 assessed maternal seizures, finding an RR of 2.07 (CI 0.12, 32.41) due to seizures occurring in one subject in each of the intervention and control groups. One study116 of active surveillance used automated text messaging to identify adverse events following Tdap or IIV (of which >95% were quadrivalent IIV) among pregnant women in Australia. When comparing Tdap plus IIV to IIV alone, there was no significant difference i n women seeking medical advice via telephone for adverse events ( RR 2.53; CI 0.89, 7.2) or being medically attended for adverse events ( RR 1.82; CI 0.7, 4.51). KQ3c3. For each adverse event associated with a particular vaccine, what are the risk factors for the adverse event? As outlined, we did not find any adverse event s associated with vaccines in pregnant women, but we discuss any risk factors that were examined for adverse events below. Few studies addressed risk factors for adverse events, though thr ee studies examined adverse events based on timing of Tdap. In one cohort study,154 adverse events were stratified by timing of receipt of Tdap . Optimally timed vaccine was defined as 27 weeks onward, and early was defined as less than 27 weeks. Optimally timed Tdap was associated with significantly lower risk of preeclamp sia/eclampsia (aHR 0.96: 0.94, 0.99), but early Tdap was not (aHR 1.05; CI 0.99, 1.12). Both optimally timed and early Tdap were associated with small increased relative risks of chorioamnionitis (a HR 1.11; CI 1.07, 1.15 for optimal and 1.19; CI 1.11, 1.28 for early) and postpartum hemorrhage (a HR 1.23; CI 1.18, 1.28 for optimal and 1.34; CI 1.25, 1.44 for early) . However, these relative increases corresponded to low absolute risk increases. Early Tdap was associated with significantly increased risk of premature rupture of membranes (a HR 1.08; CI 1.02, 1.15) , but optimally timed Tdap was not (a HR 1.03; CI 1.00, 1.06). However, it is possible 137 that the study failed to adjust for all residual confounding, and t hat receipt of the Tdap prior to the recommended timing might have been a proxy for atypical care or anticipated premature birth. In addition, there is no clear biologically plausible mechanism whereby greater time since having received Tdap is more highly associated with a mechanical rupture of membranes than more temporal ly associated Tdap administration . Two other studies of timing of Tdap administration raised no concerns for early administration of Tdap. In one cohort study,144 the subset of women receiving Tdap at or after 2 0 weeks' gestation, as compared to their unvaccinated matches had no increased risk for incident gestational diabetes, thrombocytopenia, venous thromboembolism , or cardiac events heart failure). In another study123 comparing receipt of Tdap at 0 to 13 weeks' gestation with receipt at 27 to 36 weeks' gestation, earlier administration was no t associated with increased risk of adverse events. In a cohort study65 of pregnant mothers in Australia w ho received Tdap compared to those who did, there was no increased risk of ADHD in their offspring compared to those who did not receive Tdap, including when looking by birth year and solely among nulliparous women. KQ3d. What adverse events are associated with these vaccines in the fetus/infant? KQ3 d addresses the severity, range of possible effects, and risk factors for the adverse events in the fetus/infant of pregnant women. KQ3d1. For each adverse event associated with a particular vaccine, w hat is the average severity and frequency? We did not detect associations of in utero vaccine exposure with adverse events for the fetus or infant of vaccinated women. There were no studies in fetuses/ infants of pregnant women using HepB, quadrivalent IIV or quadrivalent RIV . The prior 2014 identified only evaluations of trivalent IIV and monovalent H1N1 influenza vaccine, which are no longer in use. Among infants of women vaccinated for Tdap during pregnancy, we did not detect any statistically sign ificant associations with adverse events. KQ3d2. For adverse event s without statistically significant associations with a particular vaccine, what is the range of possible effects? Below we report all pooled risk estimates for adverse events that were rep orted on by more than one study. We note any instances where individual studies contributing to a pooled risk estimate were statistically significant on their own, indicating increased risk of an adverse event. We also report on studies with risk estimates that could not be computed and pooled statistically. Finally, as for KQ1 and KQ2, we summarize the range of possible effects by vaccine in brief below for all adverse events for which the relative risk estimate did not favor the intervention (i.e., RR>1), but the association was not statistically significant. Where appropriate, we contextualize the finding to understand the range of possible effects. Hepatitis B Vaccine s in the Fetus/ Infant We did not identify any studies that assessed adverse events associated with HepB, in the fetus/infant in this update or in our original report. 138 Influenza Vaccines in the Fetus/ Infant We did not identify any studies that assessed key adverse events associa ted with quadrivalent IIV or any studies of quadrivalent RIV in the fetus/infant in this update. The prior 2014 report identified only evaluations of trivalent IIV and monovalent H1N1 influenza vaccine, which are no longer in use. Tdap in the Fetus/ Infant We identified four RCTs125, 172, 179, 181 and 13 cohort studies52, 64, 65, 67, 91, 121, 123, 144, 154, 170, 182, 191, 198 that assessed adverse events in pregnant women and/ or their offspring among women who received Tdap. RCTs assessed Adacel125, 172, 179 or Boostrix ;181 in most ca ses, the vaccine(s) used for women followed in the cohort studies were not specified. Three of the RCTs172, 179, 181 were placebo controlled, and one RCT125 compared Tdap to Td . As for outcomes in pregnant women, we did not separate out the one study that compared Tdap and Td, as Tdap is sufficiently different from Td given the acellular pertussis component. The other studies used participants not vaccinated with Tdap as control groups. Fetal or infant outcomes of primary interest that were assessed in more than one study were birth defects, cardiovascular outcomes, death, encephalitis/encephalopathy, and seizures. We found no significant differences in fetal and infant adverse events across these studies. Across ei ght studies,67, 123, 125, 172, 181, 182, 191, 198 we found no evidence of increased risk of birth defects (RR 0. 77; CI 0. 43, 1.38) , but we detected heterogeneity (I2 81%) and some evidence of publication bias (Egger test p=0.007, Begg test p=0.399). Of note, one of the studies182 reported an increased risk of birth defects ( ankyloglossia [ tongue tie ]; RR 1.53; CI 1.33, 1.77; events 221/8299 vs 1063/61090); the next most common was congenital anomalies of the feet, which was less common in infants of mothers vaccinated with Tdap. Across four studies, 154, 181, 182, 191 we found no evidence of increased risk of encephalitis/ encephalopathy (RR 1.23; CI 0.60, 2.54). One of the studies154 reported an increased risk of infant encephalopathy (RR 1.46; 1.23, 1.73; events 165/113094 vs 577/577000); however, this was based on crude rates, and in adjusted analyses there was no increased risk. T wo 181, 191 of the remaining three studies showed either no cases of the adverse event ( 0/341 vs 0/346; 0/1199 vs 0/1259) and the remaining study182 showed a lower rate of the adverse event in the intervention group ( 12/8299 [0.14%] vs 101/61090 [0.16%] ). Across three studies,170, 181, 191 we found no evide nce of increased risk of cardiovascular events in infants of vaccinated mothers (RR 0.7 7; CI 0. 50, 1.20). Across another three studies,181, 191, 198 we detected no evidence of increased risk of deaths in infants (RR 0.15; CI 0.00, 8.88). Across yet another set of three studies,91, 154, 182 we found no evidence of increased risk of seizures in infants (RR 1.02; CI 0.76, 1.35). While the RR was technically greater than 1, t he percentages in each group experiencing seizures were essentially the same (0.25% in both groups when combining across all three studies ). We found no evidence of increased risk of febrile seizures, intussusception, meningi tis, or stroke based on single studies125, 170, 172 reporting on the outcome. The study assessing meningitis was an RCT125 with an RR of 1.03 ( CI 0.07, 16.3) . There was one case of infant meningitis in each of the two groups (N=134 versu s N=138). No conclusions about the range of possible effects can be drawn based on the extremely wide confidence intervals. Among other fetal or infant outcomes, one cohort study64 of 81,993 infants in the United States found no difference in the risk of autism spectrum disorder between those expo sed to Tdap in utero and those not exposed, with most who received a positive initial diagnosis 139 receiving a confirmatory diagnosis after the age of two. A cohort study91 that followed 324,463 mother -infant pairs reported no difference in the risk for neonatal microcephaly between i nfants exposed to Tdap in utero and those not exposed. One cohort study170 found that infants exposed to Tdap in utero had a significantly higher gestational age at birth; a significantly decreased risk for preterm birth and small size for gestational age; and fewer days of hospitalization comp ared with those not exposed to Tdap. Likewise, another observational study182 reported a decreased risk for preterm birth, low birth weight, small for gestational age, large for gestational age, respiratory distress syndrome, transient tachypnea of newborn, tachycardia or bradycardia, hemolytic diseases, other neonatal jaundice, anemia, syndrome of infant of mother with gestational diabetes, and hypoglycemia in infants born to mothers who received Tdap during pregnancy. A cohort study 65 of pregnant mothers in Australia who received Tdap compared to those who did not s howed no association between prenatal Tdap and ADHD in offspring ( HR 1.00; CI 0.88, 1.14). KQ3d3. For each adverse event associated with a particular vaccine, what are the risk factors for the adverse event? As outlined, we did not find any association of adverse event s with vaccines in fetuses/infants exposed in utero, but we discuss any risk factors that were examined for adverse events below. Of the three studies123, 144, 154 that compared early versus optimal timing of Tdap, none identified any increased risk of adverse events among infants of pregnant women by timing of vacci ne. One cohort study170 examined adverse events among infants of women who received one dose of Tdap versus two or more (from prior pregnancies) . No difference in postnatal outcomes was noted between women who were administered Tdap at least twice in the past 5 years and those who received only a single dose. KQ3 : Summary of Findings for Safety of Vaccines in Pregnant Women and Their Fetuses/Infan ts Table 23 documents the evidence for all identified studies evaluating the effects of vaccines in pregnant women for the prespecified key adverse event s. The summary of findings table documents the results across studies grouped by vaccines. The table shows the number of RCTs, the number of other studies, the number of participants across pooled analyses, the studies contributing to the risk estimate, findings for the outcomes of interest, the criteria used to downgrade the SoE, and the SoE summar y statement. The relative risk of an adverse event was derived by comparing the reported event rates in vaccinated participants compared to a control group across all studies that reported the data for that outcome. The absolute rates of adverse events (nu mber of events, number of assessed participants) for the vaccine and the control group are also shown. In many instances, results were based on single occurrences of a specific adverse event. Where studies reported insufficient detail and did not contribut e to the effect size estimates, the table reports the results as reported by the study authors. 140 Table 23.

The update identified one study of quadrivalent IIV , but this study did not report on key adverse events . The update identified no studies of the quadriva lent RIV currently in use in pregnant women. For Tdap, t he update found no evidence of increased risk for maternal cardiovascular events, maternal death , maternal diabetes, eclampsia /pre-eclampsia, preterm labor, maternal reproductive system events, stillbirth, cardiovascular events in infants, death in infants , encephalitis/ encephalopathy in infants , or seizures in infants (moderate SoE ). The update found no evidence of increased risk of maternal encephalitis/encephalopathy , autism in infants , birth defec ts in infants , or febrile seizures in infant s (low SoE) . There was insufficient evidence due to the studies being graded as insufficient or no stud ies for some key adverse events. Table 23a summarizes the findings across the prior 2014 report and the upda te. 144 Table 2 3a.

We conducted an extensive literature search and identified a substantial number of studies that compared the presence and absence of adverse events between vaccinated and comparator groups . Overall, our evidence review found vacc ines to be safe across populations with serious adverse events being rare, consistent with other recent systematic reviews of vaccine safety. 535 Findings in Relation to the Decisional Dilemma(s) Vaccines for Adults Since the prior 2014 report on vaccine safety, a number of new vaccines have become available for adults, including recombinant zoster vaccine ( RZV ), hepatitis B vaccine with a , and adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine ( aIIV), of which m any are i ndicated primarily or exclusively for older adults. Zoster Vaccines RZV has been of particular interest , given that it involves a novel adjuvant and is exclusively used in the older population. Of note, we found no evidence for increased risk of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, anaphylaxis or serious allergic reaction, asthma, ataxia, autoimmune disease, autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease) , events, seizures, or stroke for RZV (low or moderate strength of evidence [ SoE] ). We identified a reduced risk for herpes zoster (high SoE) . This finding is presumably due to the vaccine itself reducing risk of zoster (as expected) , but given concern for an association with herpes zoster for other vaccines containing novel adjuvants ( e.g., HEPLISAV -B\u00ae; see below) the lack of increased risk is reassuring. Hepatitis B V accines The newest hepatitis B vaccine, which has a novel immunostimulatory adjuvant ( cytidine - phosphate -guanosine oligodeoxynucleotide adjuvant ), is another vaccine for adults approved since the last report. F or outcomes for which there was sufficient evidence for this n ew vaccine, we found no evidence of increased risk for asthma, autoimmune disease, cardiovascular events, death, herpes zoster, repro ductive system events, or stroke (low SoE). Of note , we identified a relative risk greater than one ( but no t statistically significant ) for outcomes including cardiovascular events, herpes zoster, myocardial infarction, and stroke , although we combined three randomized controlled trials ( RCT s), of which two included predominantly younger patients . These events\u2014 and particularly an imbalance in the rate of death and myocardial infarction in one of the RCT s 99 though not the other two RCT s\u2014were noted to be of concern to the FDA.379 The manufacturer is conducting two post -marketing observational surveillance studies, which are underway as of August 2018.1087 One study is evaluat ing the occurrence of 146 herpes zoster, as well as new-onset immune -mediated diseases a nd anaphylaxis , and is examin ing acute myocardial infarction interim results1088 announced by the manufacturer suggest no increased risk o f acute myocardial infarction). There is no evidence of increased risk of multiple sclerosis, as noted in the prior 2014 report which only evaluated the older hepatitis B vaccines (Recombivax HB\u00ae and Engerix- B\u00ae), which remains unchanged with moderate SoE. The current report also found no evidence of increased risk of diabetes across all hepatitis B vaccines (moderate SoE) , based both on evidence both the prior report and the update . Pneumococcal Vaccines In the prior 2014 report , SoE high that 23 -valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23 ) is not associated with risk for cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events in adults aged 65 years and older , and this SoE remains high in the current report based on the new evidence reviewed in the update . Across studies published since the 2014 report , there is insufficient evidence for most other outcomes associated with PPSV23, except for death for which there was no evidence of increased risk (moderate SoE) . While th ese effect s may be an indirect result of the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing pneumococcal disease, the lack of harms is encouraging. Overall, for 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13 ), which was not examined in the prior 2014 report, there was moderate SoE for no increased risk of cardiovascular events, herpes zoster , myocardial infarction , reproductive . There was low SoE for no increas ed risk of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis , anaphylaxis or systemic allergic reaction, encephalitis/encephalopathy , idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, meningitis, or seizures. In one large cohort study 231 of PCV13 compared to no PCV13, there was an increased risk of all -cause pneumonia amon g adults aged 65 years and older ; no significant association was found between vaccination and death . Of note, this observational cohort study had some flaws, including that some of the unvaccinated population in the cohort study w ere assumed to have poten tially received PPSV23 in the past. Importantly, a large RCT72 of PCV13 in older adults , found no increase in all -cause community - acquired pneumonia . Influenza Vaccines The pres ent report examined all currently available influenza vaccines, including the newer recombinant influen za vaccine ( RIV) and aIIV . Since the prior 2014 report that included only trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine ( aIIV (available in trivalent and quadrivalent forms ) have been replaced by quadrivalent influenza vaccines, which are the focus of the current report. We note that in almost all studies examined in this report , quadrivalent influenza vaccines of any type were compared to the prior trivalent vaccines and adjuvanted influenza vaccines were compared either to a non -adjuvanted influenza vaccine (trivalent a IIV to non- adjuvanted ( quadrivalent aIIV to trivalent aIIV); this means that interpretation of findings is limited to these specific comparisons. Looking at all of the non -adjuvanted quadrivalent IIV, we found no evidence for increased risk for a number of outcomes, including asthma, cardiovascular events, death, myocardial infarction, reproductive system events, seizures, or stroke (low SoE). There was insufficient 147 evidence for a number of outcomes, including Guillain- Barr\u00e9 syndrome , and compari sons tended to be to other influenza vaccines as opposed to no vaccine . For the new er aIIV for older adults released since the prior 2014 report , we again identified no evidence of increased risk, including for asthma, autoimmune disease , death, SoE). Most comparisons were made to other influenza vaccines. There was moderate SoE for no increased risk of cardiovascular events and stroke, which is important to note given that this vaccine is indicated in adults 65 years and older who may be at higher risk for these conditions. For quadrivalent RIV , which is also newly approved for adults ( including pregnant women , though we found no studies in this population) , studies of non- pregnant adults showed no evidence of increased risk for adverse events such as cardiovascular events, death , encephalitis/ encephalopathy, myocardial infarction , reproductive system events , or stroke (low SoE) compared to compared to other influenza vaccines ( quadrivalent IIV). Vaccines for Children Among children, there continues to be a reasonably robust body of evidence related to vaccine safety. Rotavirus Vaccines The prior 2014 report identified moderate SoE for the association of rotavirus vaccine and risk for intussusception, based on one analysis from the United States' Post -Licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring (PRISM) program, al though RCT s did not demonstrate an increased risk of intussusception following rotavirus vaccine . The package insert s for both rotavirus vaccines note intussusception as a risk, and it is also listed in the Vaccine Injury Table as a condition covered under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program if it occurs within 21 days of rotavirus vaccination. 1092 The update found no evidence of increased risk of intussusception following rotavirus vaccine at the latest time of follow -up across nineteen studies that could be pooled. This finding is consistent with a recent meta -analysis,674 which examined the pooled estimated risks of intussusception within 31 days a fter each dose and one and two years after vaccination , and identifi ed no association of risk of developing intussusception following receipt of the rotavirus vaccine . However, as in the prior 2014 report there were mixed findings across other studies, which included pre -post studies, cohort studies, and self -controlled case series. S even studies75, 102, 135, 175, 208, 236, 237 reported an increased risk of intussusception, with particular emphasis on the first dose of rotavirus vaccine : In addition, two population- level studies83, 213 showed an increase in the number of intussusception cases following the introduction of rotavirus vaccine. In spite of these studies that showed positive associations, many other studies showed no association of rotavirus vaccine with an increase in the risk for intussusception. This includ ed no difference before and after introduction of the rotavirus vaccine at a population level , 106, 131, 168 between patients who received rotavirus vaccine and patients who did not, 74, 108, 155, 212 and between patients before and after receiving rotavirus vaccine.122, 133 While the trial -based data support a lack of association between rotavirus and intussusception at the ti me of latest follow -up, g iven these mixed findings from other study types regarding an association between rotavirus vaccine and intussusception, continued monitoring of rotavirus vaccine and risk for intussusception, particularly the risk following the first dose , may be helpful. 148 Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccine Both our own prior 2014 report and numerous other reviews conclude that measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine ( MMR ) is not associated with the onset of auti sm in children. Although t he current report found insufficient evidence for most outcomes, two studies138, 141 reported no association between administration of MMR and t he risk for autism, including among children with siblings with autism. Based on both reports consistently showing lower risk of autism, taken together with the findings from the prior 2014 report, the SoE remains high for no evidence of increased risk of autism following MMR. The prior 2014 report found high SoE for increased risk of febrile seizures; this update identified evidence that did not change the prior evidence statement. In general, febrile seizures do not cause permanent harm and do not have any lasting effects . 1090 All other findings from the prior report remain unchanged as well, except that the update newly identifies no evidence of increase d risk of asthma (low SoE). Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella Vaccine The prior 2014 report did not note adverse events associated with combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine ( update , we reviewed one study148 that show ed an increased risk of febrile seizures in the seven to ten days following vaccination with MMR -V compared to MMR and varicella vaccines separately , which would result in approximately 4 excess cases per 10,000 children vaccinated . However, t his result was not supported by the findings of an RCT89 we reviewed or by those of another cohort study,96 albeit with a risk window of interest likely too soon to detect the increased risk of febrile seizures . This resulted in the evidence for an association being judged as insufficient based on the studies reviewed as part of this update . Based on information in the package ins ert,842 there was an increased rate of fever 5-12 days after vaccination with dose 1 in pre -licensure studies for those who received MMR -V compared to M MR and varicella vaccine separately. There was no increased risk of febrile seizures, but these studies w ere not designed nor statistically powered to detect such a difference. This finding led to a post -marketing study that found an increased risk of febr ile seizures in the 5-12 days following dose 1 ( relative risk 2.20; 95% confidence interval 1.04, 4.65) , but not in the 0-30 days following dose 1 nor at any time following dose 2. We note that even with this potentially increased risk with dose 1 , febrile seizures are generally not harmful long -term and are already noted in the Warnings and Precautions section of the product labeling for the vaccine . In addition, the CDC recommends that providers who offer the combination MMR -V vaccine clearly communicate to parents and caregivers about the possibility of febrile seizures. 9-Valent Human Papillomavirus Vaccine The prior 2014 report found moderate SoE that human papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccine s (either 2 -valent or 4- valent , which w ere the available vaccines at that time) w ere not associated with increased risk for appendicitis, stroke, seizures, syncope, venous thromboembolism, onset of juvenile arthritis, or onset of T ype 1 diabetes. One analysis of long- term follow -up data from Black adolescents and adults (aged 16-24 years) enrolled in two RCT s of 4- valent HPV vaccine (HPV4) showed a possible increased risk of miscarriage of pregnancies within 4 years of vaccination ; however, this formulation of the vaccine is no longer in use , and it should be noted that HPV vaccines are contraindicated during pregnancy. The current report reviewed studies of 9-valent HPV vaccine ( HPV9 ) only, as this is the currently available vaccine , and r aises no concerns around the safety of HPV 9. We note that 149 most comparisons were made to prior 2 -valent HPV vaccine (HPV2) and HPV4. Some post - marketing studies could not be analyzed as reported results did not differentiate between HPV9 and previous versions. W e found no evidence of increased risk for autoimmune disease, birth defects, death, reproductive system events, seizures, or spontaneous abortion (for which participants were followed up to 6 years) (all low SoE) . Of note , our report showed no evidenc e of increased risk across all available studies that examined spontaneous abortion at the time of latest follow -up. However, in a post -hoc analysis of data from one RCT136 restricted to the subgroup of inadvertent pregnancies that occurr ed within 30 days of vaccination, there was a higher risk of spontaneous abortion with HPV9 (28.4%, 19/67) compared to HPV4 (12.7% , 7/55) .1091 Importantly, the higher rate of spontaneous abortion in the intervention group wa s found to be consistent with the background rate of the event .1091 Meningococcal Vaccines Studies that assessed serogroup B meningococcal vaccine (MenB) , which was newly approved since the prior 2014 report, found no evidence for increased risk of anaphylaxis or systemic allergic reaction, asthma, death, reproductive system events, or seizures (low or moderate SoE ). Studies of existing s erogroup A, C, W, and Y meningococcal vaccines (MenACWY -D and MenACWY -CRM ) also found no evidence of increased risk, as did studies of the new vaccine MenACWY -TT, although there was insufficient evidence for some outcomes of interest. Other Vaccines The prior 2014 report noted an increased risk for f ebrile seizures associated with PCV13 (moderate SoE ). However, based on some conflicting evidence from new studies included in the update , we have downgraded the SoE from moderate for an association between PCV13 and febrile seizures to low . Younger age wa s associated with increased risk for febrile seizures in some studies. One pre -post study90 of extremely low birth -weight infants compar ing risk periods before and after different vaccines found an increased incidence of sepsis evaluation and need for respiratory support after D TaP, inactivated poliovirus vaccine ( IPV), Haemophilus influenzae (HepB) , DTaP-IPV/Hib, and D TaP-HepB- IPV, and increased risk of intubation after D TaP, IPV, Hib, and D TaP-HepB- IPV. This special populations of extremely low -birth -weight infants may warrant further study . Increased risk of encephalitis or encephalopathy is a concern following pertussis -containing vaccines, and is included as a covered condition in the Vaccine Injury Table .1092 The update found no new studies addressing the possible association. The update identified one study62 that reported an increased risk of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in the 5 to 28 -day risk interval following tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine ( Tdap ) compared to the follow ing nine months , but this effect was not observed in the longer 2 to 42- day interval. The same study also showed no association with transverse myelitis. The excess risk for acute disseminated encephalomyelitis was calculated to be about 0.4 cases per one million doses of Tdap given ( 95% confidence interval -0.04, 1.16). However, the study aut hors note d that this finding is based on two exposed cases \u2014one of which had also received a vaccine not recommended for his age group at that time. They also note d that because a large number of statistical comparisons were performed without adjusting for multiple testing, the result could be due to chance alone. Overall, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis appears to be rarely 150 associated with Tdap, if at all. Given that this finding was reported in only one study, we rated the evidence as insufficient, but note it as an area for possible future research. Vaccines for P regnant Women and Their Fetuses/ Infants This report also identified increasing evidence assessing the safety of vaccines among pregnant women. For this update, we identified n o studies in pregnant women that assessed the effects of hepatitis B vaccines or RIV , which is an area that could be targeted for further research. We identified one study of quadrivalent IIV, but it did not assess any of the key adverse events pre -specifi ed for this report , nor any other serious or severe adverse events . While we did not identify any studies of quadrivalent vaccines in pregnant women, our 2014 report uncovered no safety concerns related to trivalent IIV or monovalent H1N1 influenza vaccine , neither of which are currently in use. Although this report reviewed only vaccines in current use, we note that a recent case- control study 1093 of data collected over three influenza seasons (2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15) found no increased risk of spontaneous abortions among pregnant women who received IIV (almost all trivalent vacci ne). We identified a number of new studies that examined the safety of Tdap for pregnant women and their newborn infants, including four RCTs and 12 cohort studies. This enabled us to make many new evidence statements, of which several had moderate SoE ( maternal cardiovascular events, maternal death, maternal diabetes, eclampsia/pre -eclampsia, preterm labor, maternal reproductive system events, stillbirth, cardiovascular events in infants, death in infants, encephalitis/encephalopathy in infants, seizures i n infants ) and others had low SoE ( maternal encephalitis/encephalopathy, autism in infants, birth defects in infants, febrile seizures in infants ). We note that w omen who received Tdap had significantly lower risk of preterm labor (which included preterm d elivery if preterm labor was not reported) than did comparison groups (moderate SoE) . The mechanism for this protective effect is not clear, and our systematic review was not designed to assess the effectiveness of vaccines in reducing harms. Among five large cohort studies, two identified a slightly increased risk for chorioamnionitis, 91, 154 while others reported no difference in risk.67, 121, 170 This potential slightly increased risk c ould be investigated further. In terms of longer -term effects, w e found a significantly decreased risk of autism (low SoE) among infants whose mothers received Tdap ; this was based on one study,67 and again the mechanism for this effect is not clear. Other studied outcomes for which no difference was found in infants exposed to Tdap in utero include neonatal microcephaly. Strengths and Limitations Strength of the Review Our review of the literature was extensive and designed to maximally capture evide nce on the presence or absence of adverse events associated with vaccines in studies with a comparator evaluating vaccines in human participants . To identify data, w e relied not only on research databases, but also on publicly accessible grey literature. W e searched C linicaltrials.gov for information on unpublished trials with results post ed in the trial record, as well as all A dvisory Committee on Immunization P ractices (ACIP) statements and vaccine package inserts. While we did not use FDA regulatory documents as a primary source, we drew upon such documents 151 whenever any signal was identified for potentially increased risk (e.g., HEPLISAV -B and myocardial infarction). After searching the literature, we employed a transparent, established protocol to minimize the risk of missing relevant studies. The review team followed inclusive decision rules and ordered full text copies of any publications reporting on interventions or observational studies of the vaccines of interest \u2014even if ostensibly reporting only on clinical effectiveness \u2014in order to identify studies that reported on harms only in the full publication. We review ed adverse events reported in comparative vaccine studies regardless of whether or not they might be at tributed definit ively to the intervention. We systematically identified evidence of the absence of specific adverse events (i.e., events that were assessed in research studies but that did not occur if reported as such ). We allowed for complex comparisons where a vaccine was evaluated in the presence of a second vaccine (e.g., HPV9 and Tdap) and compared to the second vaccine alone (e.g., Tdap). For some vaccines, many of the studies included an active vaccine comparator to ensure that that the intervention is compared to the current standard of care. Thus, w e also allowed for comparisons between a vaccine and the vaccine it was replacing (e.g., quadrivalent IIV and trivalent IIV ) or to (e.g., MenACWY -TT to MenACWY -CRM or MenACWY -D). A comparison between a vaccine and an active comparator may underestimate rate of adverse effects relative to a comparison between that same vaccine and placebo. Given this, we clearly note when an active vaccine comparator was used throughout the tex t of this report. To address the difference in studies, we report first the risk estimates for the vaccine of interest compared to either placebo or a base treatment that the intervention group also receives (e.g., routine vaccines), and then we report the risk estimate when combined with studies that included an active vaccine comparator. We also allowed for combin ing of studies where populations were different (e.g., one study of RZV given to healthy adults and another of RZV given to adults with stem cel l transplants); including studies of non- healthy populations enabled us to assess the risk of adverse events in populations that might be at higher risk for such events . While our inclusive approach added to the complexity of the review, this approach has the benefit of captur ing the fullest evidence base possible for the range of vaccines and potential harms. Limitations of the Review While our literature search procedures were extensive, some unpublished trial results may not have been identified. As noted above, we were able to mitigate this possibility by searching trial databases directly and reference mining relevant publications , including ACIP recommendations. We also may have missed studies due to the challenging nature o f assessing harms as contrasted with assessing effectiveness, since many publications focus on the clinical effectiveness of an intervention with either no, sparse, incomplete, or non -systematic assessment and/or reporting of safety data . While search filt ers exist for effectiveness studies, filters to address harms are not as successful in identifying relevant studies. Thus, a s noted above, we intentionally screened the full text of all vaccine intervention studies to minimize missing safety data. We also note that the current review builds on the prior 2014 report, which itself built upon the 2011 Institute of Medicine (IOM ) report. The prior 2014 report did not search for or include studies on vaccines that were covered in the IOM report and published pri or to 2011. In the current report, only for vaccines for which there were new indications or for new vaccines did we perform targeted search es for research published prior to 2014. Wherever possible, we used 152 data that could be combined in meta -analyses in this update from the prior report to estimate the relative risk based on all available research studies. In addition, we narratively synthesized research findings across both the prior 2014 report and the update to assess the SoE. This report reviews currently recommended vaccines for routine use, and does not include new vaccines in development or under emergency use authorization, such as vaccines for the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID -19) pandemic . We also excluded studies of vaccines no t currently in use in the United States. For example, while HPV2 and HPV4 are no longer in use in the United States, studies of the safety of these vaccines (still in use in other countries) would likely inform discussions of the safety of HPV9. We acknowledge that studies of other widely used vaccines could be useful but were required to limit the scope to a focus on the United States. We also excluded non- English language studies. Although we were considering only vaccines approved for use in the United Stat es, it is possible relevant epidemiological studies have been published in non- English journals. While we did identify sub- group analyses within studies that met our inclusion criteria, there may be additional reports of studies that assessed specific risk factors but that would not have been included if there were no appropriate comparator (e.g., a study comparing HPV9 in men and women, where all participants receive the vaccine). Despite the large number of studies included, indirect analyses across studi es to assess the effect of participant or administration variables were possible only for selected characteristics and selected outcomes. This was because studies varied widely in the strategy used to assess the safety of the vaccines and used different datasets (e.g., some used mining datasets that included data for many different vaccines). In addition, some studies reported adverse events of interest at a system or group level (e.g., rate of all cardiovascular events) , but others did not. For studies that did not report system -level rates of system -level adverse events, we had to instead choose the most common adverse event within the relevant system (e.g., unstable angina) to use available data to the extent possible. This resulted in some estimates that are based on combined systems and event -level rates, but in cases where such analyses indicated more events in the vaccinated group , we also performed sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the finding s and r eviewed the nature of the events. As was the case for the prior Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 2014 report and the IOM report, the current report focused on the association of specific vaccines with particular adverse events. One of our inclusi on criteria was that studies must include both an intervention vaccine and a comparator (either placebo, no vaccine, or the comparator vaccine closest to what the new vaccine is replacing). Because of this approach, drawing conclusions about the safety of the immunization schedule taken as a whole, multiple vaccines together, and/or certain adjuvants and preservatives is not generally possible from this report's findings . A further limitation results from the fact that not all immunizations and thus adverse events may have been captured , particularly if they occurred outside of the medical home and/or if the state did not have a vaccine registry. Statewide registries for adults are much less common than they are for children. Adults are also more likely to g et their vaccines at alternate locations such as their workplace or at pharmacies. Given the nature of the studies that were included , all of which had to have some comparator, loss of information from this limitation is less likely for this report. Finally, we note that many of the harms we were assessing as our key adverse event s (e.g., acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome, transverse myelitis, anaphylaxis) are quite rare and the number of studies that reported on the presence or absence of events for a vaccine was sometimes small . As a result, despite ou r extensive searches for data 153 that could be combined across studies, our confidence intervals are often wide, which make the risk estimates imprecise. Risk estimates had wide confidence intervals in individual studies given that often only one or two event s occurred in the entire sample, but also in estimates combined across studies. Although statistical pooling is a data aggregation method, we used random effects meta -analyses, which do not average the results of the identified studies , but set out to esti mate the true risk by treating the studies as samples from an underlying distribution. When only few studies are available, the effect estimates differ, and /or the event rate is rare, the confidence interval of the effect estimate will be very wide as the true effect is estimated from a very small sample of potential studies. With this review being no exception, rare events present considerable methodological challenges. 49 However, we investigated all instances of more observed events in the vaccinated group further regardless of the precision of the risk estimate and transparently present all rates. In addition, we considered all available data regardless of whether they could be combined in a pooled estimate, including post -marketing surveillance and other observational studies such as self -controlled case series and case -control studies , in the grading the SoE. Strength of the Evidence Base We identified a large number of studies reporting on the presence and absence of adverse events , and in particular a number of new studies on the use of Tdap in pregnant women. The studies reported on a group of patients vaccinated with the vaccine of interest and a control group, an important feature as many of the adverse events of interest are not unique to vaccines and we had to establish whether the event was more likely in the vaccine group. We included expe rimental and observational studies and m any studies included in the current report are RCTs , which by design should minimize differences between intervention and control groups. We extracted data both from published journal articles and clinical trial reg istries. The importance of trial registries has increased dramatically since reporting of results has become mandatory. Clinicaltrials.gov is set up to capture results that can be used in systematic reviews and meta -analyses, including data on severe adver se events, serious adverse events, and mortality. In general, t he harms data in Clinicaltrials.gov ha ve been found to be more complete than in the corresponding publications , 1094, 1095 although we note that the database tends to better capture the presence of adverse events than the absence of such events (that is, when no adverse event occurs in either the intervention or comparator group). As a result, our findings may well underestimate the safety of vaccines, as we did not count the absence of adverse event s in the study record as evidence of absence of effects; we only considered studies that explicitly reported the presence or the absence of the adverse events of interest . Other innovative methodologic approaches have also improved the analysis of adverse events , particularly for post -marketing studies. For example, i n the United States, the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink uses data obtained through such systems at eight large healthcare organizations, enabling high- quality studies using methodologies such as self -controlled risk intervals analyses. Other nations with single payer healthcare can often leverage their extensive electronic registries, which allow for epidemiological studies of entire populations. Limitations of the Evidence Base An important limitation common to systematic reviews in general is the quality of the original studies included. We critically appraised included studies in detail. Studies that reported 154 timing and severity and defined adverse events using standard, precise definitions were rated higher than those that did not. Limitat ions of studies vary according to their design. Controlled trials often have insufficient sample sizes to identify very rare adverse event s as discussed above, and may not follow participants long enough to identify long- term sequelae. E ven in studies with generous follow -up times, the timing of events is not always optimally reported. E xcept where explicitly noted in the text, controlled trials of vaccines tend to be conducted in healthy patients. Thus, persons who may be more susceptible to adverse event s may be excluded from trials yet eligible to receive a vaccine after it is licensed. Given the above limitat ions of controlled trials, comprehensive reviews of vaccine safety must include post -licensure studies, but these are not without their own limitations. People who avoid vaccinations whether deliberately or not , may differ from those who receive vaccinatio ns in terms of race, sex, age, socioeconomic status, and preexisting medical conditions, and these differences may in turn be associated with health outcomes. Observational studies typically attempt to control for such potential confounders by using matche d cohorts or multivariate regression analysis. However, some factors such as environmental exposures may be unmeasured or challenging to control for adequately. The self -controlled case series was developed specifically to assess the safety of vaccines; th is method eliminates confounding by all time-independent variables by using cases as their own controls and predefined \"time windows\" before and/or after vaccination. W hile self -controlled case series control for patient characteristics that do not change over time (i.e., gender, race, ethnicity, genetics), they cannot capture factors that are time related. This is especially important when studying vaccinations of infants and toddlers. Another limitation of such studies is that the data provided typically do not allow for pooling across studies (e.g., combining a self -controlled case series study of rotavirus vaccine that provides adjusted relative risk with an RCT of rotavirus vaccine that provides counts of events). Studies using passive surveillance such as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS ) are crucial in identifying signals regarding adverse events post -licensure. By definition, they do not consider the rate s of such events in non- vaccinated populations, and thus are not designed to asse ss a statistical association between a vaccine and an adverse event ; thus , these studies were excluded from this project. VAERS data might contain important adverse event signals that are not identified in this report and that warrant future research. Post-licensure epidemiological studies are conducted to investigate possible associations between vaccines and adverse event s reported in passive surveillance or multiple case reports. Such studies often do not limit their investigation to a particular brand o r formulation. It is difficult to assess the utility of studies that do not report specific details about vaccines, or lump vaccines against a specific disease together. For example, a study might investigate the effect of \"seasonal influenza vaccines\" in general, even when the vaccines used may be quite different (e.g., live attenuated influenza vaccine and IIV ). We exclude d such studies that reported on a category of mixed vaccine types, if there were distinct vaccines in use at the time of the study (e.g., \" meningococcal vaccines\" when both MenACWY and MenB were in use during the same period). Applicability Evidence related to vaccine safety was found for many key adverse events for most vaccines across all K ey Q uestions (adults, children, and pregnant women and their infants). Generally, 155 results should be applicable to the populations receiving routine vaccines. However, we identified few sub- group analyses related to race and ethnicity differences ; this may partially have been a function of excluding stu dies without a comparator, as noted above and/or what is published in the literature . Most studies included only healthy participants, al though we did identify studies in vulnerable sub- populations (e.g., people with HIV infection , people with malignancies and stem cell transplants). W hile studies of pregnant women were still limited in number for HepB and influenza vaccines , there was robust new evidence to support an assessment of safety of Tdap. Most vaccine interventions were tested either against placebo, against the closest comparator (e.g., MenACWY -TT versus MenACWY -CRM), or against the vaccine the newer formulation was replacing (e.g., HPV 9 versus HPV 4). In clinical practice, vaccines are often not given in isolation, particularly for children . A number of studies we identified were either clinical trials of a group of vaccines typically given together (e.g., MenACWY and Tdap and HPV 9 versus Tdap and HP V9 alone ; such studies would be included) or observational studies of children receiving routine vaccines, with a focus on one new vaccine (e.g., rotavirus and routine vaccines versus routine vaccines alone). While such studies better reflect the usual rou tine vaccination practices, they can be more challenging to analy ze. While some studies prespecified adverse events in response to the public's concern about vaccine safety, most did not explicitly state that this consideration was part of their selection process. Ensuring that studies are patient -centered and collect outcomes that consider concerns about vaccines would help to ensure that results are meaningful to patients. Studies such as those using the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) and the Post-Licensu re Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring System (PRISM ) typically analyzed data on prespecified outcomes that had been identified through other vaccine safety signal monitoring systems (e.g., VAERS). Some published vaccine trials were not specific in report ing adverse events. Broad categories such as \"injection -related adverse events,\" \"systemic adverse events,\" \"one or more adverse events ,\" or \"serious adverse events\" were sometimes reported instead of specific harms, which tends to be less useful in suppor t of public or other decision -making. In addition, many studies reported on a list of pre -defined adverse events but did not rate the severity or provide enough information to determine severity. Studies with entries in Clinicaltrials.gov tended to have much more complete results for serious adverse events reported on the site than in publications . Timing was typically clearly specified for solicited local and systemic reactions (within 7 -14 days), but the timing of serious adverse events was not always as granular. Publications most frequently discussed timing of deaths , but not that of other key adverse events. Implications for Clinical Practice, Education, Research, or Health Policy It is important to note that this report is not intended to provide direct guidance to healthcare providers, but rather to assess the current state of knowledge about vaccine safety and to identify research gaps for future exploration. Overall, our report found vaccines to be safe across a spectrum of populations, which has important implications for decision -making at every level (patients, healthcare providers, policymakers). We did not identify any studies meeting our inclusion criteria that assessed HPV9 in adults over age 26. The pr ior 2014 report identified tw o RCT s of previous HPV vaccines in young adults, both in women and both reporting no serious adverse events. As HPV9 is now approved for adults up to age 45, epidemiological studies should track and report any adverse 156 events in adults over age 26 as a sub- group. Further study of the risk of spontaneous abortion among women who become pregnant shortly after vaccination may also be helpful. We also did not identify studies assessing MMR in adults for this update. In the prior 2014 report , the SoE was insuffic ient to draw sclerosis onset, and chronic arth ropathy, due to the absence of evidence . The update identified one study on mixed samples (children and adults) that found no evidence of increased risk of transverse myelitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, or optic neuritis. Epidemiological studie s of adults should continue to assess and report on s erious adverse events . The potentially increased risk of herpes zoster and myocardial infarction following HEPLISAV -B noted as identified by the FDA warrants further research and ongoing post - marketing surveillance ; studies are already underway to address these issues. Our study did not examine risk of local injection site reactions and symptoms such as pain following vaccination. However, for some vaccines such as RZV, the association with an increase in such reactions is well established, with grade 3 vaccine -related local and general adverse reactions within the seven days post -vaccination with RZV being more common than with placebo . 843 The increased rate of local reactions could potentially lead to increased rate of injury (e.g., from falls) due to functional limitations, which may warrant further research. In terms of vaccines for children, our report shows that vaccine s are generally very safe, continuing to show high SoE for no increased risk of autism following MMR across two studie s and now mode rate SoE for no increased risk of intussusception following rotavirus vaccine , although some studies still suggest increased risk particularly after the first dose . Some studies did find an increased risk of febrile seizures with MMR -V, and healthcare providers may wish to ensure that families are aware of this risk when balancing it against the benefit of giving one injection instead of two injections . Two studies that enrolled at -risk infants \u2014one of D TaP in extremely low birth weight infants, and one of rotavirus vaccine in premature infants \u2014reported an increased risk of certain adverse events such as evaluation for sepsis, need for respiratory support, and need for intubations afte r DTaP administration to extremely low birth weight infants , and bradycardia and apnea among premature infants receiving rotavirus vaccine. This population tends to be more medically fragile and may particularly benefit from vaccination, so potential risks of vaccination should be communicated to parents to inform decision making. While studies of Tdap in pregnancy have greatly increased, w e did not identify any studies that assessed adverse events associated with HepB or quadrivalent influenza vaccines in pregnant women or their infants in this update or in our original report. T his is an important gap that warrants additional study , particularly given the need for clinicians to point pregnant women to evidence -based resources. 455 For Tdap, the possible slightly increased risk of chorioamnionitis among pregnant wom en in two of five studies c ould be investigated further, given potential implications for both pregnant women and their newborns. Across all studies, severity of adverse events was often not well described or categorized, and better understanding of severity in addition to frequency will help inform future decisions about vaccines. In addition to the adverse events addressed in this report, future work may need to focus more strongly on percei ved safety risks, in particular where they translate into vaccine hesitancy. While some studies assessed the potential effects of factors such as age, concomitant vaccines, and sometimes co -existing morbidities on the risk for adverse events from vaccine 157 administration , subgroup analyses were frequently not reported by race/ethnicity among the studies that met inclusion criteria for this report. Differential analyses should identify risks specific to subgroups to ensure that vaccine safety is addressed thr ough the lens of health equity. Ensuring that vaccine safety research includes important subgroup analyses where possible would help inform discussions of safety across all populations. For example, safety considerations may be unique for adults aged 65 years and older , in whom adverse events such as local reactions are more likely to affect the performance of activities of daily living . Given the rare nature of some of the serious adverse events of interest, ongoing studies of large populations and post -marketing surveillance of vaccines after FDA licensure are needed . Currently, vaccines are closely monitored after licensure, using various surveillance systems such as the VAERS (co -managed by the FDA and the CDC), 500 PRISM (part of the Sentinel Initiative, which is FDA's national system for monitoring medical products af ter they are licensed for use),22 and Vaccine Safety Datalink23, 24 and Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment project (both managed by the CDC) .25, 26 Future va ccine research will also need to take into account the expanding landscape of new vaccines and vaccine technologies, in particular the new COVID -19 vaccines. 1096 Conclusion Across this large body of research , we found no new evidence of increased risk since the prior 2014 report for key adverse events following administration of vaccin es that are routinely recommended for adults children, and pregnant women. Signals from the prior report remain unchanged for rare adverse events that include anaphyla xis in adults and children, and febrile seizures and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in children. T here wa s no evidence of increased risk of adverse events for vaccines currently recommended in pregnant women . Resear ch gaps identified by this report includ ed rare adverse events for which the evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions , as well as factors that may be associated with increased risk for adverse events. H owever, important considerations when de ciding whether studies are warranted include the severity and frequency of the adverse event being studied and the challenges of investigating rare events. The scope of this report does not include the effectiveness of vaccines, nor does it make practice recommendations or policy regarding the administration of the vaccines. Potential risks for rare adverse events for some vaccines should be weighed against the protective benefits that those vaccines provide. 158 References Note: This list of references includes references from both the main report and the appendixes. 1.

Methods This appendix documents the report methods in detail. Note: The references in this appendix can be found in the list at the end of the main report. Details of Study Selection The evidence review built on the prior AHRQ 2014 report on vaccine safet y,28 which itself built on a prior Institute of Medicine (now National Academy of Medicine ) 2011 report on vaccine safety.29 Sources We search ed the research dat abases MEDLINE (includes TOXLINE) , Embase, Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL , includes International Clinical Trials Registry Platform records), Web of Science, and Scopus to identify controlled studies evaluating vaccines. ME DLINE indexes a wide range of biomedical literature, TOXLINE indexes studies of adverse events associated with drugs and other chemicals, Embase emphasizes pharmacological and European journals, CINAHL includes nursing literature, the Web of Science and Scopus index many technology journals , and. Clinicaltrials.gov w as searched for more information on published trials as well as results published in the trial record. In addition, we review ed Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP ) statements and the literature cited in the statements. W e also reviewed vaccine package inserts to identify relevant safety information. W e reference- mined published systematic reviews and FDA reports to ensure that all relevant studies were identified, i.e., rather th an summariz ing the reviews, we used the m as sources to identify available research studies. Furthermore, the content experts on the TEP and experts serving as peer reviewers were asked to review the list of included studies to help ensure that all relevant studies were considered. Finally, a Supplemental Evidence And Data for Systematic review (SEADS) portal w as provided and a Federal Register Notice w as posted for this review to ensure that all relevant evidence was considered by allowing public comment and submission of information. The search strategy for the databases is documented below. The search strat egies were developed, executed, and documented by an experienced EPC librarian and peer -reviewed by an experienced methodologist. The literature search was updated while the draft report was under peer review to ensure that the evidence included in the final report is up to date. Search Strategy The literature search built on the prior AHRQ report on the topic.29 For the prior AHRQ report , research databases and existing reviews were searched from inception through August 2013 for the vaccines not covered by the IOM report; for the vaccines cover ed by the IOM report , the searches dated from a year before th at report (i.e., 2010) through August 2013. Zostavax\u00ae (live zoster vaccine) was originally included in the search and the report but was subsequently excluded because it became unavailable as of November 2020. For this update, w e focused on literature published since the prior searches . However, the largest database, MEDLINE , was searched from inception of the database because of recent changes to the search interface . Search output was imported into the existing citation library from the prior 2014 report A-2 and a ll duplicates were discarded where duplicates were detected. In cases where a vaccine was newly approved or ha d a new indication since the last report , we conducted new literature searches. In addition, we re- screened citations previously identified for the vaccine and applied the inclusion criteria for this update. The employed search strategy focused on identif ying empirical studies evaluating vaccines. The strategy was not limited to a set of known adverse events and instead aimed to identify evaluations of vaccines regardless of the included safety information. Publications and trial entries were obtained as f ull text and the full text was reviewed for data relevant to adverse events.

The AHRQ EPC Program placed a notice in the Federal Register that described the proje ct and requested public comment . In addition, we established a Supplemental Evidence and Data (SEADS) portal. Screening Procedure The citations were screened by two independent literature reviewers using a structured form in an online program designed for systematic reviews (DistillerSR). Citations deemed relevant by at least one reviewer were obtained as full text articles. Full text articles and grey literature material were screened by two independent reviewers against the explicit eligibili ty criteria. Any discrepancies in inclusion decisions were then discussed among the full review team. For studies that were excluded, reasons for exclusion were documented (see Appendix B for the list of excluded studies with reasons for exclusion). Inclu sion and Exclusion Criteria The eligibility criteria are described in a PICOTSSO (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes, timing, setting, study design, and other limiters) framework in Table A.1. Table A.1. Eligibility criteria Domain Inclusion Exclusion Population Human participants of all ages for whom the vaccines are recommended in the United States Studies in animals or mechanistic/in vitro studies Studies exclusively in populations for whom the vaccine is not approved or is contraindicated (see Tables A .3-5) A-14 Domain Inclusion Exclusion Interventions All KQs Individual vaccines included in the CDC's routine immunization schedules recommended for adults, children and adolescent s, and pregnant women, as well as combination vaccines in use in the United States (see Tables A .3- A.5) Vaccines for adults (KQ1) Hepatitis for Children and Adolescents (KQ 2) Vaccines for children and adolescents will include diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis pertussis (Tdap; Adacel, Boostrix) Studies of vaccines not on the U nited States recommended schedules, including brands/formulations not available in the U nited States , or no longer used A-15 Domain Inclusion Exclusion Comparators Active comparators (e.g., other vaccines or other vaccination schedules) and inactive comparators (e.g., no vaccine) Unvaccinated participants, everyone getting 1 vaccine but one group getting 2 [A+B vs A is an eligible design when B is the test vaccine]). Concurrent (e.g., RCT) and historic control (e.g., pre-post study). Studies without intervention comparator Outcom es Adverse events identified in participants, and, in the case of pregnant women, in their fetuses/infants (including the presence and the absence of harms, toxicities, transient side effects, and unintended adverse health effects) Studies reporting only o n effectiveness outcomes Timing Short term (within 42 days following immunization) as well as long term (>42 days after immunization) effects No exclusions apply Setting(s) No restrictions with regard to settings No exclusions apply Study design Control led studies (randomized and non -randomized controlled clinical trials, cohort studies comparing two or more cohorts (observational, not under the control of the investigator) , case -control studies , self -controlled case series ) Studies without comparator (e.g., case studies *) Studies need to have an unvaccinated group or a group that did not get the vaccine that is being evaluated. Historic comparators from the same institution are ok (e.g., comparing to last year's cohort) but studies comparing to external data (e.g., national surveys) are excluded. Other limiters English language scientific journal publications and trial records with published results Studies published in abbreviated form only (e.g., letters, conference abstracts) Studies reported only in non-English publications *Case studies were outside the scope of the report because they do not include unvaccinated individuals for comparison. To maximize the applicability of the report to the population of the United States , only studies tha t employed human participants and vaccines included in the CDC's routine immunization schedule s recommended for adults, children and adolescents, and pregnant women, as well as combination vaccines in use in the United States were included. For the same reason, only English- language reports were included ; however, we included English language studies conducted outside of the United States if the vaccines studied were included in the CDC immunization schedules and the formulati ons were approved for use in the United States . We accepted studies where a small proportion of participants (up to 20%) was included for whom the vaccine was not approved but we excluded s tudies exclusively in populations for whom the vaccine was not appr oved or was contraindicated , and we excluded studies that included participants for whom the vaccine was not approved or contraindicated and the proportion of these patients could not be determined. To enable true assessments of risk, only studies with va lid control groups were included. We accepted control groups receiving placebo; unvaccinated control groups ; self-controlled studies where two risk intervals were compared (e.g., weeks immediately following the vaccine A-16 administration and periods before or sufficiently distant from the vaccine administration); and studies where the intervention and the control group both received multiple vaccines but only the intervention group received a specific vaccine of interest (\"add -on trial\" design) . For this update we also included control groups receiving the previously available vaccine (prior standard of care) and control groups receiving acceptable active comparators (e.g., combination vaccines that were compared to the individual vaccines) . The definition of acceptable comparator depended on the particular vaccines. For HEPLISAV -B, the comparator could be an existing Hepatitis B vaccine. For HPV9, comparators could include HPV2 or HPV4. For the comparator could be trivalent influenza vacci nes of the same type. For quadrivalent aIIV or RIV, the comparator could be IIV. For MenACWY- TT the comparator could be MenACWY -CRM or MenACWY -D. For PCV13, the comparator could be PCV7 or PPSV23 (for adults). For RZV, the comparator could be ZVL (though none of the included studies used this particular comparator) . For Tdap the comparator could be Td. For combination vaccines, the comparator could be the individual vaccines given together at the same time. We accepted observational studies where not all re levant factors were under the control of the investigator , but we excluded studies where control groups were systematically different from the intervention groups in aspects other than the vaccine administration. No studies were excluded based on setting, timing of follow up, or risk of bias. To ensure sufficient information was included to assess studies in detail, only studies published in full in a journal manuscript or in trial records were included .

The extraction forms for study- level data were designed to include detailed instructions, definitions, and descriptions of categories to guid e reviewers and to avoid ambiguities. T hese forms were repeatedly tested and refined to minimize ambiguity and to increase reliability. The data extraction was monitored frequently, questions were discussed among the review team, and additional guidance wa s added to the online forms as needed. Data from studies already included in the 2014 report w ere included in the same software. The data extraction process was designed to capture all information published about the study, including the trial record, stud y protocol, interim analyses, main analysis, or subgroup analyses. Multiple publications reporting on the same participant groups were counted as single studies and entered the review analysis only one time for each relevant outcome. Throughout the data ex traction process, data from publications reporting on the same participant group w ere consolidated . The data extraction included study- level variables displayed in the evidence tables (Appendix D) and results variables used in the review analysis and criti cal appraisal of the study. These variables consisted of the following: Study ID A-19 o Author and publication year of the main publication, country, PubMed entry link, trial registration number, additional publications reporting on the study, type of publicatio n (journal manuscript, trial record), study design (parallel RCT, cluster RCT, clinical trial, cohort study , case -control study ), number of participants (study size indication), power calculation for non- inferiority analysis, funding type (industry- funded, industry- funded but unrestricted grant, unclear, non- industry funding) Participant characteristics o Key Q uestion category (children, adults, pregnant women), a ge (mean, standard deviation [SD]), gender ( percent female), race/ethnicity, genotype information , underlying medical conditions , inclusion criteria , proportion of participants given the vaccine who were outside of recommended age range Intervention arms o Vaccine type, dose and schedule , formulation , individual or combination vaccine, mode of administration ; adjuvants, co -interventions (e.g., medications [including other vaccines] administered concomitantly) Control and comparator arms o Type, description Outcomes o Method of collection and type of safety information collected Results o Results for key adverse event s: type of outcome , severity, and adverse event rates in intervention and control arms , other results, risk factor analyses The included studies varied widely in the number and type of adverse events reported. In particular trial registr ies now allow authors to add all available data independent of journal manuscript restrictions, and some studies reported hundreds of different adverse event categor ies. To ensure consistency across studies and a systematic approach to using the available data, our data extraction followed a specified algorithm . We extracted adverse events by outcome category (e.g., seizures) . Where data on relevant summary categories (e.g., cardiovascular events) were presented together with a denominator , we e xtracted these to capture the maximum number of relevant data . Where studies listed more than one type of relevant adverse event and it was not clear whether some patients had experienced multiple events (e.g., chest pain and myocardial infarction), we sel ected the most frequent event . If event s were equally frequent , the most severe adverse event in the category was selected (e.g., infertility for reproductive issues ). Our unit of analysis was the number of pa rticipants with an event, rather than the number of events, as patients can experience multiple events, but the denominator for the vaccinated and the unvaccinated group is the number of participants . Furthermore, given the very large number of adverse event categor ies, e xcept for the key adverse event s selected in conjunction with the TEP for which all events were ex tracted, o nly serious and severe adverse events or those highlighted by the authors were ex tracted. We used the author's definition of serious and sever e and considered adverse events to have been highlighted by the study authors if they were mentioned in the study's abstract . Hence , we would extract fever classified as \"severe\" but not mild fever. To allow the reader to understand the type and severity of the events , we implement ed a transparent and comprehensive categorization system , based on the Common Terminology A-20 Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) classification system,45 to structure the safety assessment . The current CTCAE system (version 5) differentiates 837 adverse events within 26 adverse event categories . The system categories are described in Table A.5. Table A. 5. System category System Organ Class Numeric Code Blood and lymphatic system disorders 1 Cardiac disorders 2 Congenital, familial and genetic disorders 3 Ear and labyrinth disorders 4 Endocrine disorders 5 Eye disorders 6 Gastrointestinal disorders 7 General disorders and administration site conditions 8 Hepatobiliary disorders 9 Immune system disorders 10 Infections and infestations 11 Injury, poisoning and procedural complications 12 Investigations 13 Metabolism and nutrition disorders 14 Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 15 Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl. cysts and polyps) 16 Nervous system disorders 17 Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal disorders 18 Psychiatric disorders 19 Renal and urinary disorders 20 Reproductive system and breast disorders 21 Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 22 Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 23 Social circumstances 24 Surgical and medical procedures 25 Vascular disorders 26 Each specific adverse event was graded for severity on a five -point scale. Grade 1 characterizes mild events or asymptomatic or mild symptoms, or clinical or diagnostic observati ons that do not require intervention. Grade 2 is a moderate event where minimal local or noninvasive intervention is indicated , and/or activities of daily living are limited . Grade 3 is a severe event that is medically significant but not immediately life -threatening , includes hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization , or is disabling, limiting self -care activities of daily living . Grade 4 events are l ife-threatening consequences that require urgent intervention. Grade 5 describes d eath related to the adverse event . Rather than relying on the author's interpretation of outcomes, we appl ied the categorization and CTCAE system consistently to all included studies and rate d the adverse event severity accordingly . We applied the system to all assessed adverse events, thereby systematically identifying evidence of the presence as well as the absence of specific adverse events. Events that were assessed in research studies but that were reported not to have occur red were also extracted an d entered in the analyses. Data were extracted for both the intervention and control groups. Study results were then converted to rates and proportions to facilitate comparisons among studies. Risk of Bias Assessment of Individual Studies All included stud ies were assessed for key sources of bias that could have influenced the reported results. The assessments were undertaken by one reviewer; a second reviewer checked A-21 the assessment for accuracy and consistency across studies. We used the McHarm scale, a to ol for structured critical appraisal of adverse event data reported in research studies, for the assessment. Adverse event assessment and reporting are often lacking in rigor; thus, we applied critical appraisal criteria assessing two main domains:42, 43 Data collection of adverse events Reporting of adverse events The appraisal of the data collection method evaluated the rigor of the adverse event assessment (e.g., use of a scale or checklist) and whether adverse event data were collected actively (e.g., all participants were asked about the occurrence of specific harms) or passively (e.g., participants might have reported events at their discretion, but without structured assessment or specific prompts). The reporting appraisal assessed whether adverse events, including serious adverse events, were defined by the study authors. In addition, we review ed whether the authors specified the number of p articipants affected by each type of adverse event (the number of adverse events per group is a problematic measure because some patients experience multiple events). Data Synthesis and Analysis The results are documented in a structured synthesis, suppor ted by tables and figures, in the main report. The synthesis is organized by Key Question, then by type of vaccine, then by type of event. Summary tables synthesize evidence across studies. The included studies are broadly characterized based on study char acteristics, participant details, intervention categories, identified comparator, and outcome categories employed in the published studies in Appendix C. Study details and results of all included studies for vaccines of interest are documented in evidence tables in Appendix D to provide a concise overview. In the r esults section and in the summary tables, we report the relative frequency and severity of the adverse events and the SoE for the presence or absence of specific adverse events. To answer K ey Q uestion 1a, K ey Q uestion 3a, the synthesis reports how many studies have assessed an adverse event. To address K ey Q uestion 1b, K ey Q uestion 3b, i.e., to determine whether a specific adverse event is associated with a vaccine, we document how many times the event occurred in the study samples. T he report include d only s tudies that report ed on a control group or comparator not exposed to the vaccine (or time prior to when an individual was exposed to a vaccine, in the case of self -controlled case series) , on a different vaccine schedule , or exposed to a different formulation. Rates of adverse events in the intervention group w ere compared to those in an appropriate control group that ideally differed only in the exposure to the vaccine. We calculated the relative risk and the 95 percent confidence interval for the adverse events for all studies by comparing the intervention and control group rates. We also include d observational and surveillance studi es that analyz ed medical records, health insurance claims, or government registries . We combined study results for the studies included in this update in meta -analyses where studies reported sufficient detail and provided information of the rate in the va ccinated as well as a control or comparator group. We used random effects meta -analytic models with a modified Hartung- Knapp corrections using the metafor package in R , estimated with the restricted maximum l ikelihood estimator . 47, 48- 50 As relative risks cannot be computed when cells are zero (e.g., one or both arms across studies had zero events) , we added a constant of 0.5 to the empty cells as per Cochrane Handbook.46 Random effects models are used in statistical models to estimate effects when we believe that we are combining effects from heterogenous A-22 populations.1097 Random effects an alyses assume that there is a super -population of pa rticipants, which comprises a number of subpopulations.1098 Each study takes a sample from a subpopulation of pa rticipants . The results of the subpopulation analyses cannot be combined without taking into account the random effects. The weight of a study in the meta -analysis is a function of the size of the study, and the magnitude of the effect in that study, relative to the other studies. Failing to take account of random effects can lead to dramatically inflated type I error rates. A random effects meta -analysis attempts to determine the average relative risk .1099 We investigated the performance of the variou s approaches to the calculation of the standard errors using a brief Monte -Carlo simulation investigation .1100 In particular w hen a low number of studies is meta- analyzed, the Hartung- Knapp correction to the standard error (which uses the t, rather than the z distribution) is recommended to obtain appropriate standard errors (and hence confidence intervals and p- values). However, when the heterogeneity of trial effects is below the expected value, this correction can lead to much smaller standard errors, which can inflate the type I error rate. A recent suggestion, implemented in the metafor package in R, is to use an adjusted Har tung- Knapp procedure . When heterogeneity of effect sizes is equal to or greater than the expected value, the H artung- Knapp correction is applied. When heterogeneity is lower than expected, the correction is not applied. To determine the most appropriate me thod for the standard error calculation we carried out Monte Carlo simulation s and we identified the adjusted Hartung- Knapp approach as the most appropriate method as it gave the lowest type I error rate when population effects were both heterogenous and homogenous (when population effects were homogenous, the uncorrected standard error was equally appropriate when population effects were homogenous , and the H artung- Knapp correction was equally appropriate when population effects were heterogenous) .We also considered Bayesian analysis using the Stan package in R with a non- informative prior but encountered many convergence problems. In addition, when models satisfactorily converged, the substantive results did not change. For all meta -analyses, we report th e point estimates, the 95 percent confidence intervals, and the statistical significance of the summary estimates. To facilitate the interpretation of the results, we reported the absolute rate of adverse events (number of events for the vaccinated group, number of participants in the vaccinated group, number of events for each control group, number of participants in each control group) as well as the relative risk . The review of adverse events followed a cautious approach. We first computed relative risks to find signals for potential adverse events. In a second step, w e reviewed all findings in detail that reported more adverse events in the vaccine group across studies. Studies in adults (18 years and up) were described in KQ1, studies in children up or including 18 years of age were classified as KQ2 (meaning that if a study included both children and adults, the study was included under KQ2) . As described above, in addition to documenting the types of adverse events, we characterized the severity and frequency of the events associated with the vaccines. To address sub -questions KQ1c1, KQ2c1, and KQ3c1 (the average severity and frequency of each adverse event associated with a particular vaccine), we used the CTCAE rating system to document the average severity of the specific adverse events reported in existing studies. To address KQ1c2, KQ2c2, and KQ3c2 (the range of possible effects for adverse events without statistically significant associations with a particular vaccine ), we documented the range of possible effects based on the confidence interval surrounding the point estimate across studies. To address KQ1c3, KQ2c3, and KQ3c3 (the risk factors f or each adverse event associated with a particular vaccine ), we explored potential risk fa ctors for adverse events in meta- regressions and subgroups. These analyses explored whether patient or vaccine characteristics A-23 are systematically associated with observed adverse events. In addition to the key subgroups of adults, children and adolescents, and pregnant women, an additional pre -specified subgroup comprised adults over the age of 65 years (KQ1c1) . Furthermore, we differentiated live- attenuated and inactive vaccines where possible. For meta- regressions, we added patient variables (age, gender, race/ethnicity, genotype, or underlying medical conditions) and intervention variables (individual vs combination vaccines, schedule of administration, adjuvants, and medication administered concomitantly) of interest to the meta -analysis model. For this update we had access to all new studies published in the last seven years as well as evidence included in the 2014 AHRQ report on the topic (we did not re -review prior excluded studies unless there was a new vaccine or new indication for a vaccine, for wh ich we conducted targeted searches as needed) . However, many evidence statements supported by statistical effect estimates in this update are based on evidence identified in the update. The prior 2014 report built on research undertaken by an IOM committee and the 2014 report reviewed if any new research confirmed or challenged conclusions or provided new insights. The IOM report was to some extent based on mechanistic evidence outlining possible biological associations between adverse events and a potentia l mechanism of action associated with the vaccine formulation. In addition, it integrated expert opinion about plausible mechanisms, in particular in the absence of research evidence in human participants comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated participants rather than focusing on empirical risk estimates for adverse events. We qualitatively combined the findings from the 2014 report and new research identified in the update search for all included vaccines, populations, and key outcomes. We reviewed all instances where the SoE in the 2014 report and this update found differences and we integrated the SoE across the prior 2014 report and the update . All studies that reported rates of adverse events that could be computed, whether from the prior 2014 report or the update, were combined in meta -analyses. When studies could not be combined statistically, we narratively synthesized the findings to inform the SoE assessment and ensure that all available evidence was considered and integrated. However, f or many out comes of interest, prior studies either did not provide data or reported data not in sufficient detail in order to allow analyses (e.g., reporting counts for the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups together with the number of participants) . In other cases, the SoE was not based on research studies in human participants but rather mechanistic evidence and expert opinion. And some vaccines have changed over time - for example, the majority of influenza vaccines included in the prior report are not in use anymore. Where the update identified no studies, we provided information on research included in the prior report. All prior SoE findings were summarized narratively within each Key Q uestion section. Grading the Strength of the Body of Evidence For each K ey Q uestion, we selected key adverse events that are documented in summary of findings tables to assess the strength of the evidence. The evidence tables report all outcomes addressed in the individual studies, but the SoE assessment used a priori defined outcom es to evaluate the overall safety of the vaccines across studies. These key adverse events were identified with the help of the TEP and content expert input that we engaged during the report update , and informed by published literature: Key adverse event s for KQ 1 (adults): Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, anaphylaxis or systemic , angioedema , death , diabetes, Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome syndrome), cardiovascular events ( prioritizing myocardial A-24 infarction, cardiac disorders, major vascular event, angina and, if not available, then adverse events related to the cardiac or vascular systems) , seizures, s troke , transverse myelitis Key adverse event s for KQ 2 (children and adolescents): Ac ute disseminated encephalomyelitis, anaphylaxis or systemic allergic reaction, angioedema, cardi ovascular event s (as defined above) , death, diabetes, Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome ( including Miller Fisher syndrome), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, seizures, stroke, transverse myelitis Key adverse event s for KQ 3 (pregnant women): Birth defects, death, eclampsia/ pre- eclampsia, preterm labor (including preterm delivery if preterm labor was not reported), spontaneous abortion, s tillbirth In addition, for speci fic vaccines, additional key adverse event s were determined: For D TaP, Tdap , and Td , encephalopathy) and brachial neuritis . For Hepatitis B vaccines, we assessed autoimmune disease, a utoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto 's addressed a myotrophic lateral sclerosis , multiple sclerosis , and reproducti ve issues (prioritizing adverse events that would impede reproduction and, if not available, then adverse events related to reproductive organs) . For all influenza vaccines, a sthm a was assessed. For m eningococcal vaccines, we assessed encephalitis /encephalopathy and m ultiple sclerosi For r otavirus vaccines, we specifically addressed f ebrile seizures, i ntussusception, and Kawasaki disease. For v aricella assessed ataxia s econdary transmission of live varicella virus . If we identified data for any key adver se event \u2014even if not specific to the population/vaccine \u2014we reported those findings in the evidence tables and summary of findings tables for that vaccine. The s ummary of findings tables document the results across studies for key adverse event s as well as the quality of the evidence and our confidence in the effect estimates. The summary is organized by K ey Q uestion, vaccine, and outcome. The SoE assessment uses the AHRQ EPC program ' SoE assessment categories, taking the following domains into a ccount: Study limitations Consistency Precision Reporting bias Directness Each domain encompasses a number of different reasons for downgrading the SoE. The summary of findings tables uses the connotation system that are presented here in detail. Each summ ary of findings table note section list all reasons for downgrading relevant to the findings in the individual table. A-25Study limitations (e.g., risk of bias in included studies) addressed the study design, sample composition, sample size, comparator, and rigor of reporting or identification of adverse events. We downgraded findings without concurrent control group, i.e., that were exclusively based on a comparator rather than a control group (comparing the adverse events of a new vaccine to that of an older vaccine that was previously in use) or that used pre- intervention data as comparator, or that compared control and text periods rather than unvaccinated and vaccinated groups ( \u00b0). We downgraded findings that were exclusively based on observational da ta (\u00b0\u00b0). We also downgraded studies contributing to KQ2 (safety of vaccines in children) that combined children and adults ( \u00b0\u00b0\u00b0). Furthermore, we downgraded studies reporting adverse events that ruled out that the event could be related to the vaccine (e.g., a death due to a car crash not associated with the study intervention) and studies that did not attempt to ascertain whether the adverse event could have been caused by the vaccine ( \u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0) . We would have also downgraded studies not reporting at least one event in the vaccine and the control group as the study sample was considered too small to detect events but this case did only occur in cases where the evidence had been already downgraded for other domains. The domain consistency differentiated consist ent and inconsistent findings across studies . We assigned \"unknown\" in the case of a result that was based on a single study whose findings or analysis had not been replicated yet and downgraded the evidence ( ). We reviewed how consistently studies report ed the presence or the absence of specific effects for adverse events. We estimated the statistical heterogeneity in meta -analyses and reviewed the consistency of the direction of effects for other results . We downgraded for evidence of heterogeneity acros s studies (I 2 > 70%, ) and for conflicting results regarding the risk of adverse events across studies (). Precision was scored as either precise or imprecise, where precise indicated that the result reflects a clinically unambiguous conclusion. Precision was operationalized as the confidence interval surrounding the point estimate. We considered the statistical significance as well as the direction of e ffects given that rare events are difficult to detect. We used a threshold of a relative risk of >1 to determine the null effect where 1 indicates an equal risk of an adverse event in the vaccinated and the unvaccinated group and results above 1 indicate more e vents in the vaccinated group. We downgraded for wide confidence intervals; for example , where the confidence intervals indicated that the risk of an event may be a third of that of a control group or three times as high in the vaccine group compared to a control group (^) . We downgraded studies that reported insufficient detail and that did not allow us to independently calculate the relative risk from the reported rates, i.e., where we had to rely on the authors' reporting of effects (^^). In order to rec eive a rating of high SoE for no evidence of increased risk, the confidence interval could not cross the threshold of 1 (which indicat es that some values were consistent with an interpretation of an increased risk in the vaccine group, ^^^ ). The domain reporting bias differentiated between suspected bias (e.g., there is indication of publication bias, selective outcome reporting, or selective reporting of the analysis) and undetected bias (no bias indicated). We did not expect substantial reporting bias, gi ven that the decision to publish will have likely been driven by the effectiveness outcomes and not necessarily the outcomes of interest for this report (i.e., adverse events), but we did assess publication bias using standard tools (i.e., Begg and Egger t ests) for the key adverse event s. We downgraded for evidence of reporting bias where Begg's rank test, Egger 's regression test, or both tests indicated evidence of reporting bias (p<0.1, $). A-26 Directness differentiates between direct, i.e. head -to-head, comparisons (e.g., comparing a vaccinated and an unvaccinated group within a study) and indirect evidence derived from comparisons across studies (e.g., meta -regressions to assess the effect of combination versus individual vaccines). Given the small number of studies for each adverse event and the numerous differences between studies, we were unable to interpret the indirect analyses with confidence (we did not identify statistically significant moderators) and this criterion was no t applied. The SoE domains are compatible with the GRADE group's criteria to downgrade the quality of evidence. Each evidence statement was assessed with these criteria to determine the overall SoE. The SoE assessment differentiat ed the following levels: High : High confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderate : Moderate confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research may change our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Low: Low confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is likely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Insufficient evidence : Evidence either is unavailable or does not permit a conclusion. The categories communicate the confidence in the summary estimates for the finding s across studies. In cases where the SoE was at the level of insufficient evidence, only one reason per domain was reported. The evidence statements were drafted by one literature reviewer and discussed among the team to ensure quality control and consiste ncy of interpretation. Assessing Applicability Applicability refers to the extent to which the effects observed in published studies are likely to reflect the expected results when the intervention (i.e., vaccination) is applied to the population of inter est under \"real -world\" conditions. Relatively few clinical trials are designed with applicability in mind; 1101 furthermore, they sometimes report only a few of the factors needed to fully assess applicability. Thus, we are including observational studies that contain an unvaccinated control/comparison group such as population surveillance, self-controlled case ser ies, retrospective and prospective cohorts, and analyses of administrative databases. Defining the populations, interventions, timing, and outcomes (as described in the K ey Q uestions and analytic framework) inevitably considers factors that may affect the applicability of studies. Reviewers ex tracted this information and consider ed it in summarizing the applicability and limitations of the evidence. Evidence tables clearly distinguished studies designed to assess effectiveness from those designed specifical ly to assess safety. To make applicability information useful, the report addressed how specific aspects of study design affected the final population and how greatly (and in which direction) that final population might differ from more representative popu lations in practice. Throughout, we also document the likelihood of association of reported adverse events with the vaccine , based on mechanism and biological plausibility, to provide the reader with additional contextual information.

Note: The references in this appendix can be found in the list at the end of the main report Results of Literature Searches The literature searches and public posting identified a large number of relevant material. Literature Searches This update identified 36,076 citation s. Of these, 4,303 were obtained as full text. In total, 189 studies reporte d in 338 publications were identified in this update. SEADs Input We solicited public comments for the project in two ways. The AHRQ EPC Program placed an advertisement in the Fed Eteral Register that described the project and requested public comment. In addition, we established a Supplemental Evidence and Data (SEADS) portal. Multiple submissions from single individuals or groups were counted as one submission. Content of submissions was assessed as pro -vaccine, neutral, or vaccine -hesitant. A total of 67 submissions \u2014from 14 organizations or individuals \u2014were received through the EPC. These consisted of 11 vaccine -hesitant groups (accounting for 63 of 67 of the submissions) and three submissions that were vaccine neutral. A total of 61 submissions were received through the SEADS portal, representing18 organizations or individuals. These consisted of 15 vaccine -hesitant submitters and three neutral. Description of Included Studies This update documents studies published since the last AHRQ report on the topic28 and summarizes results from the prior report where appropriate. All included studies used participant samples where all or at least more than 50 percent were receiving recommended vaccines; none of the studies were exclusively in participants where the vaccine was counter -indicated for the participant group. We only included currently available vaccines recommended in the U nited States and excluded other vaccines. As described throughout, the included studies used a range of study designs and methods to collect safety data. The adverse events assessed for the individual vaccines are shown in the next table.
