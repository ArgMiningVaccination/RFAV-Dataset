However, increasingly they are recognised as a contaminant of emerging concern to environmental and human health when their residues enter freshwater systems. For example: psychiatric drugs alter fish behaviour; endocrine disrupting pharmaceuticals can cause reproduction toxicity in fish and increased risk of breast or prostate cancer in humans; and the overuse of antibiotics is linked to antimicrobial resistance - a global health crisis. Unless action is taken, the situation is set to worsen with growing use of pharmaceuticals projected with economic growth, ageing populations, advances in healthcare, and increased livestock and fish production. The OECD (2019) report Pharmaceutical Residues in Freshwater: Hazards and Policy Responses helps to close the science-policy loop. It provides policy guidance to cost-effectively reduce pharmaceuticals in freshwater, and their associated risks to human and ecosystem health. Ultimately, a life-cycle approach combining a policy mix of source-directed, use-orientated and end-of-pipe measures, involving several policy sectors, is required to effectively deal with pharmaceuticals in the environment across their life-cycle.The rate of increase in the production and diversification of pharmaceuticals exceeds that of most previously recognised agents of global change, such as rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, nutrient pollution, habitat destruction and biodiversity loss (Bernhardt, Rosi and Gessner, 2017). This has led to their widespread occurrence in the aquatic environment across the globe, with many active pharmaceutical ingredients found worldwide in soils, biota, sediments, surface water, groundwater and drinking water. 2 . OECD POLICY HIGHLIGHTS Pharmaceutical residues in freshwater: Hazards and policy responses 1The challenge of managing pharmaceuticals in water Pharmaceuticals in the environment are a challenge to manage for the following reasons: l Pharmaceuticals are designed to interact with a living system and produce a pharmacological response at low doses, which makes them of environmental concern even at low concentrations. l Pharmaceuticals are designed to be stable in order to reach and interact with target molecules. This means that either they are very slow to degrade or their constant use leads to continuous release into the environment at rates exceeding degradation rates.

POLICY HIGHLIGHTS OECD POLICY HIGHLIGHTS Pharmaceutical residues in freshwater: Hazards and policy responses . 3 4000 ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS About 4,000 active pharmaceutical ingredients are being administered worldwide in prescription medicines, over-the-counter therapeutic drugs and veterinary drugs (Weber et al., 2014). 30-90% ORAL DOSES EXCRETED AS ACTIVE SUBSTANCES Pharmaceuticals administrated to humans or animals are excreted via urine and faeces, with 30 to 90% of oral doses generally excreted as active substances (BIO Intelligence Service, 2013). l Conventional wastewater treatment plants are not designed to, nor do they fully, remove pharmaceuticals from wastewater. Furthermore, veterinary pharmaceuticals used in agriculture and aquaculture can enter water bodies directly or via surface runoff (diffuse pollution). l For most wildlife, exposure to pharmaceuticals in the environment could be long-term, potentially occurring via multiple exposure routes, and involving mixtures of substances.Source: W 4 . OECD POLICY HIGHLIGHTS Pharmaceutical residues in freshwater: Hazards and policy responses 2Sources and trends of pharmaceuticals in the environment Pharmaceuticals are present in the environment as a consequence of pharmaceutical production and formulation, patient use, use in food production and improper disposal (Figure 1). The presence of pharmaceuticals in freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems can result in the uptake of pharmaceuticals into wildlife, and have the potential to bioaccumulate. Humans can subsequently be exposed through drinking water, and ingestion of pharmaceutical residues in plant crops, fish, dairy products and meat. The concentrations and impacts of pharmaceuticals in the environment depend on a combination of variables, including: the toxicity, degradation, persistence and mobility properties of the pharmaceutical; source and timing of pollution; wastewater treatment plant technology, operation and removal efficiency; agriculture and veterinary practices; and the sensitivity of the receiving environment and exposure history (Figure 2). Figure 1. Major pathways of release of human and veterinary pharmaceuticals into the environment 1/3 OF PRESCRIPTION ITEMS BECOME WASTE IN THE UNITED STATES In the United States, it is estimated that about one-third of the four billion prescription items annually become waste (Product Stewardship Council, 2018). 6.5 PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY ANNUAL GROWTH RATE Projected growth rate of the pharmaceutical industry: 6.5% per year by 2022 (UN Environment, 2019). % CLIMATE CHANGE TO INCREASE RISK OF DISEASE Millions of people are predicted to be newly at risk to mosquito-borne and tick-borne diseases under climate change.

The use of pharmaceuticals will increase as: l populations age and life-spans increase; l economies grow - particularly in emerging economies - and with it, an increasing ability and expectation to treat ageing-related and chronic diseases; l livestock and aquaculture practices are intensified; l new pharmaceuticals are engineered; l climate change exacerbates existing diseases. Non-communicable diseases (e.g. cardiovascular disease and mental illness) and respiratory, water-borne, vector-borne and food-borne toxicants and infections are expected to become more common as climate change intensifies. 67 PROJECTED INCREASE IN LIVESTOCK ANTIBIOTICS WORLDWIDE BY 2030 Projected increase in antibiotics administered to livestock animals in feed: 67% worldwide by 2030 (from 2015 levels) (Van Boeckel et al., 2015). Much of this increase will come in emerging economies.% 43-67 INCREASE IN PHARMACEUTICAL USAGE, GERMANY In Germany, pharmaceutical usage is projected to increase by 43-67% by the year 2045 (from a baseline of 2015). An ageing population is thought to be the main driver (Civity, 2017).%6 . OECD POLICY HIGHLIGHTS Pharmaceutical residues in freshwater: Hazards and policy responses 3Impacts of pharmaceuticals in the environment on human and freshwater ecosystem health The presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment has raised concerns among drinking water regulators, governments, water suppliers and the public. Certain pharmaceuticals have been proven to cause undesired adverse effects on ecosystems, including mortality, as well as changes to physiology, behaviour and reproduction. Of greatest concern are: hormones, antibiotics, analgesics, antidepressants and anticancer pharmaceuticals used for human health; and hormones, antibiotics and parasiticides used as veterinary pharmaceuticals. For example, oral contraceptives have caused the feminisation of fish and amphibians, antidepressants have altered fish behaviour making them less risk-averse and vulnerable to predators, and the over-use and discharge of antibiotics to water bodies exacerbates the problem of antimicrobial resistance. A summary of human and ecosystem health impacts of pharmaceuticals in the environment are presented in Table 1. The impacts of other pharmaceuticals in the environment are less well-known; the vast majority of pharmaceuticals have not been evaluated for their long-term toxicity, occurrence or fate in the environment, and it is therefore difficult to generalise the risk they may give rise to. In real life, substances are not isolated in the environment; instead they occur mixed together and in combination with other contaminants. There is growing evidence that mixtures of pharmaceuticals possess a joint toxicity greater than individual toxicities. Table 1.

POLICY HIGHLIGHTS OECD POLICY HIGHLIGHTS Pharmaceutical residues in freshwater: Hazards and policy responses . 7Box 1. Antimicrobial resistance: an urgent, global health crisis Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health crisis with the potential for enormous health, food security and economic consequences. AMR is the ability of a microbe to resist the effects of medication that could once successfully destroy or inhibit the microbe. Drug resistant infections already cause an estimated 700,000 deaths each year globally. If no action is taken, this is projected to increase to 10 million per year by 2050 - that is more than the number of people dying from cancer. A continued rise in AMR is projected to lead to a reduction of 2-3.5% in GDP globally, with a cumulative cost of up to USD 100 trillion. The mis- and over-use of antibiotics is an important contributing factor of AMR; up to 50% of the antibiotics prescribed for human use are considered unnecessary. The number is even greater in the agriculture and aquaculture sectors, where they are mainly administered as a growth promoter and as a substitute for good hygiene. The environment becomes a reservoir for resistant genes, as well as an arena for the development and spread of resistance to pathogens. 10 OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS HAVE A POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL RISK An estimated 10% of pharmaceutical products have a potential environmental risk (K\u00fcster and Adler, 2014). 13 OF WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM HAVE HIGH PHARMACEUTICAL CONCENTRATIONS IN EFFLUENT In the United Kingdom, ethinyloestradiol, diclofenac, ibuprofen, propranolol and the macrolide antibiotics are present at high enough concentrations in the effluent of 890 wastewater treatment plants (13% of all plants) to cause adverse environmental effects in surface waters (Comber et al., 2018).% %8 . OECD POLICY HIGHLIGHTS Pharmaceutical residues in freshwater: Hazards and policy responsesThere are several mitigation options for water quality improvement in the pharmaceutical life cycle, including improvements in the design, authorisation, production, use, solid waste and wastewater treatment. A focus on preventive options early in the pharmaceutical life cycle, may deliver the most long-term, cost -effective and large -scale benefits. A selection of key mitigation policy options across the pharmaceutical life cycle are presented in Table 2. France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom have started a multi-sector dialogue to tackle the problem. At the EU level, a \"Strategic Approach to Pharmaceuticals in the Environment\" identifies actions for stakeholders throughout the pharmaceutical life cycle with an emphasis on sharing good practices, on cooperating at international level, and on improving understanding of the risks. OVER-PRESCRIPTION, SELF-MEDICATION & MIS-DIAGNOSIS INCREASE PHARMACEUTICALS IN THE ENVIRONMENT Over-prescription, self-medication (over -the-counter pharmaceuticals) and misdiagnosis of symptoms can increase the amount of pharmaceuticals in the environment. 88 OF HUMAN PHARMACEUTICALS ARE WITHOUT ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICITY DATA 88% of human pharmaceuticals do not have comprehensive environmental toxicity data. Whilst pharmaceuticals are stringently regulated for efficacy and patient safety, the negative effects they may have in the natural environment have not yet been sufficiently studied and are not covered by an international agreement or arrangement. % Design 4Policy instruments to control pharmaceuticals in the environment Figure 3.

They are limited by their removal efficiencies, high capital investment and operation costs and increased energy consumption. They do not capture diffuse sources of pharmaceutical pollution (e.g. from agriculture and aquaculture). Figure 3.

OECD POLICY HIGHLIGHTS Pharmaceutical residues in freshwater: Hazards and policy responses 5OECD Policy recommendations The OECD recommends government's take a collective, life cycle approach to managing pharmaceuticals in the environment. This means: i) designing and implementing a policy mix of source-directed, use-orientated and end- of-pipe measures; ii) targeting stakeholders throughout the life cycle of pharmaceuticals; and iii) using a combination of voluntary, economic and regulatory instruments. A national pharmaceutical strategy and action 1. Improvement of knowledge, understanding and reporting on the occurrence, fate, toxicity, and human health and ecological risks of pharmaceutical residues in water bodies in order to lay the ground for future pollution reduction measures. OECD recommendations on improving knowledge, understanding and reporting Identify potential environmental risks of existing and new active pharmaceutical ingredients through intelligent and targeted assessment strategies. Reduce unknowns on relationships between pharmaceuticals, and human and environmental health. Encourage the uptake of new monitoring methods, modelling and decision-support tools to better understand and predict the risks. Prioritise substances and water bodies of highest concern. Increase access to data and information, and institutional coordination, to reduce knowledge gaps. Adopt precautionary measures when scientific evidence is uncertain, and when the possible consequences of not acting are high. Factor in financing needs and measures to recover policy transaction costs, as well as the capacity of government officials and stakeholders to implement policies. Educate and engage with the public to manage perceived and actual risks, and improve awareness and understanding.plan to manage environmental risks should be developed in collaboration with relevant government departments, local authorities and other stakeholders, and be supported by a strategic financing strategy to ensure effective implementation. Policies that cost-effectively manage pharmaceuticals for the protection of water quality and freshwater ecosystems rest on five strategies: POLICY HIGHLIGHTS OECD POLICY HIGHLIGHTS Pharmaceutical residues in freshwater: Hazards and policy responses . 132. Source-directed approaches to impose, incentivise or encourage measures in order to prevent the release of pharmaceuticals into water bodies. They are primarily targeted towards pharmaceutical companies and manufacturing facilities. OECD recommendations on source-directed approaches. Pharmaceutical life cycle stages: design, marketing authorisation, manufacturing, post-authorisation Develop clear and shared environmental criteria (and performance indicators) for sustainable 'green' procurement of pharmaceuticals. Give inspectors the ability to control and enforce manufacturing discharge at overseas pharmaceutical manufacturing plants that supply OECD markets. Expand the regulatory framework for good manufacturing practice to include mandatory environmental criteria. Develop drinking water safety plans, monitoring programmes of pharmaceuticals and incidence reporting to identify and prevent contamination, and adapt policy to new science. Consider environmental risks in the risk-benefit authorisation of human pharmaceuticals in order to manage risk mitigation. Ensure Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) robustness, consistency and transparency. Include AMR risks and human health effects in ERAs, as well as mixture, additive and combined exposure effects. Establish a centralised database to share ERAs of pharmaceuticals and prevent duplication efforts. Provide incentive structures to advance green pharmacy, and personalised and precision medicines. A return on public investments in new pharmaceuticals should be considered when assessing support for the private sector in pharmaceutical development. Address any potential economic impacts to avoid loss of pharmaceuticals or supply chain interruptions, and to limit increased costs to healthcare providers against static budgets. Establish new business models for pharmaceuticals that balance access needs, appropriate use and adequate return. This is particularly important for new antibiotics and tackling AMR; current business models link profit (sales) with volume (consumption).14 . OECD POLICY HIGHLIGHTS Pharmaceutical residues in freshwater: Hazards and policy responses 3. Use-orientated approaches to impose, incentivise or encourage reductions in the inappropriate and excessive consumption of pharmaceuticals. They are designed to inform and change the behaviours and practices of physicians, veterinarians, pharmacists, patients and farmers. OECD recommendations on use-orientated approaches. Pharmaceutical life cycle stages: prescription and use Reduce the incidence of infection and disease. Access to safe water supply, sanitation and hygiene is particularly important. Introduce benchmarking and reporting of hospital practices and AMR-related deaths as a measure to improve accountability, transparency and ultimately performance. Reduce unnecessary use and release of pharmaceuticals. Delay prescription of pharmaceuticals when they are not immediately required. Consider restrictions on antibiotics for preventative use, and hormones as growth promoters, in the livestock and aquaculture sectors. Optimise the use of pharmaceuticals with effective diagnosis and dosing. Reduce self-prescription of pharmaceuticals (particularly high-risk pharmaceuticals, such as antibiotics and persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic pharmaceuticals) and illegal sales of pharmaceuticals. Promote best practices on the storage and use of livestock manure and slurry from livestock treated with pharmaceuticals. OECD POLICY HIGHLIGHTS Pharmaceutical residues in freshwater: Hazards and policy responses . 154. End-of-pipe measures - as a compliment to strategies 1-3 - that impose, incentivise or encourage improved waste and wastewater treatment to remove pharmaceutical residues after their use or release into the aquatic environment. OECD recommendations on end-of-pipe measures. Pharmaceutical life cycle stages: collection and disposal, and wastewater treatment and reuse End-of-pipe measures should only be used in complementary to source-directed and use-orientated measures. An over-emphasis on upgrading wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) infrastructure is not a sustainable, optimal use of limited resources. Ensure value-for-money in investments in WWTP upgrades through evaluation and prioritisation. Consider trade-offs. Factor in financing needs and cost-recovery mechanisms for capital, and operation and maintenance costs of WWTP upgrades. Ensure appropriate collection and disposal of waste pharmaceuticals. Educate and engage with health professionals, veterinarians, consumers and farmers to raise awareness about inappropriate disposal of unused medications. Promote best practices on the use and disposal of biosolids (which may include toxic transformation products) following wastewater treatment. 5. Collaboration and a life cycle approach, combining the four strategies above and involving several policy sectors. Action on pharmaceuticals in the environment is much more likely to be extended and sustained if it is mainstreamed into broader health, agricultural and environmental policies and projects.
