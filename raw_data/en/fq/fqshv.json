Was this review helpful? it has been used once and it was very good 2 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful? I have 3 indoor cats with claws so I had to purchase super strong screens for my windows. After they were i stalled we discovered they were almost impossible to remove (to clean windows/screens) without breaking them. My windows looked horrible and needed to be cleaned so bad. I literally googled \"how to clean windows without removing screens\" and this came up. Not a big investment therefore nothing to lose so I placed the order. It came in a week later and ai just tried it out. My windows sparkle. They look amazing, as well as the screens, and so clean. I will use this product forever. 1 person found this helpful.

Was this review helpful? There is no pressure, it worked just okay the first time, the second time it got clogged and I lost 1/2 the bottle of crystal liquid, it spilled out on the grass. I couldn't unclog it. Not working anymore. Very disappointed. 3 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful?
