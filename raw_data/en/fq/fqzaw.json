Since it is impossible to anticipate every clinical situa tion or presenting chief complaint that may arise, it is expected that Attending Physician consultation may be warranted. The RN will consult the Attending Physician by using their nursing clinical judgment. In general, the RN shall function within the s cope of practice as specified in the State of California Nurse Practice Act. Every patient presenting to the Emergency Department is evaluated by a provider (MD/NP/PA) regardless of the initiation of a standardized procedure by the RN. All Standard Procedu res are intended for adult patients >18 years, unless otherwise indicated . When the Standardized Procedure is initiated and any diagnostic test is ordered (blood tests, radiologic exams as listed in the procedure), the Attending in Charge will be listed as the ordering provider. The Standardized Procedures were developed with assistance from the following: 1. Implementation of Standardized Procedures. Position Statement of the California Nurse Association 2. Standardized Procedure Work Sheet, State of C alifornia Board of Registered Nursing, Department of Consumer Affairs. 2 Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center Committee on Interdisciplinary Practice STANDARDIZED PROCEDURE Registered Nurse Order Entry in the Emergency Department Title: Registered Nurse in the Emergency Department I. Purpose of Policy To exp edite patient care by initiating evidence -based interventions by Registered Nurses based on pati ent complaint and acuity. These medical medical staff approved procedures and protocols are intended to be a guide for RNs to initiate basic interventions in the Emergency Department. II. Policy Statement A. It is the policy of Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center that all standardized procedures are developed collaboratively and approved by the Committee on Interdisciplinary Practice (CIDP) whose membership consists of Nurse Practitioners, Physician Assistants, Registere d Nurses, Physicians, Administrators and other Affiliated Staff and conform to all 11 steps of the standardized procedure guidelines as specified in Title 16, CCR Section 1474. B. To outline and define responsibility in performing interventions requiring a physician order in accordance with the California Board of Registered Nursing and the Nursing Practice Act, a copy of the signed procedures will be kept in an operational manual in the Emergency Department, and on file in the credentialing liaison Medica l Staff Office. II. Functions to be performed The Registered Nurse, as outlined in the Nurse Practice Act, Business and Professions Code Section 2725, is authorized to implement appropriate standardized procedures or changes in treatment regimen afte r observing signs 3 and symptoms of illness, reactions to treatment, general behavior, or general physical condition, and determining that these exhibit abnormal characteristics. The RN provides interdependent functions that overlap the practice of medicin e. These overlapping functions require standardized procedures. These standardized procedures include guidelines stating specific conditions requiring the RN to seek p rovider consultation. III. Circumstances Under Which RN May Perform Function A. Setting The Registered Nurse may perform the following standardized procedure functions in the Emergency Department consistent with their experience and training. B. Scope of Supervision Required 1. The RN is responsible and accountable to the Emergency Department Nurse Manager and Medical Director or physician designee. 2. Overlapping functions are to be performed in areas, which allow for a consulting Emergency Department provider to be available to the RN, by phone or in person, including but not limit ed to the clinical area. 3. Provider consultation is to be obtained as specified in the protocols and under the following circumstances: a) Emergency conditions requiring prompt medical intervention b) Upon the request of the patient, registered nurse, o r provider 4. Every patient who presents to the Emergency Department is evaluated by a provider, regardless of the initiation of a Standardized Procedure by the RN. IV. Requirements for the Registered Nurse A. Experience and Education 1. Active California Registered Nurse license 2. Current Basic Life Support certification 3. Current Advanced Cardiac Life Support certification 4. Current Emergency Nurse Pediatric Course certification B. Special Training 1. Enrollment in the Emergency Department orientation program by the Emergency Department Nurse Manager 2. Successful completion of the orientation program, including protocol specific training, requirements described by the Guidelines for Emergency Nursing Practice 4 C. Evaluation of the Registered Nurse competence in performance of standardized procedures 1. Initial: at the conclusion of the standardized procedure training the Nurse Manager or designee will assess the RN's ability to perform the procedures. a. Successful completion of the RN o rientation program b. Successful completion of a review of accuracy and completeness of documentation for actual patient cases (minimum of ten the first year, then five thereafter) 2. Annual: Nurse Manager or designee will evaluate the RN's competence through a n annual performance appraisal and skills competency review along with feedback from colleagues, physicians, direct observation and/ or chart review. 3. Follow -up: Areas requiring increased proficiency as determined by the initial or annual evaluation will b e re-evaluated by the Nurse Manager, or designee at appropriate intervals until acceptable skill level is achieved. This evaluation may include chart reviews. V. Development and Approval of Standardized Procedure A. Method of Development Standardized procedures are developed collaboratively by the registered nurses, nurse managers, physicians, and administrators and must conform to the eleven steps of the standardized procedure guidelines as specified in Title 16, CCR Section 1474. B. Approval The CIDP, Credentials, Medical Executive, Nursing Executive, and Joint Conference Committees must approve all standardized procedures prior to the implementation. C. Review Schedule The standardized procedures will be reviewed every three years by the registered nurses, nurse manager, nurse director and medical director and as practice changes. D. Revisions All changes or additions to the standardized procedures are to be approved by the CIDP accompanied by the dated and signed approval sheet 5 Protocol # 1 Assessment and Management of Abdominal Pain Protocol: Infestation A.
