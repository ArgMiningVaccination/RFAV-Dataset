That's why our [bedding](/collections/bedding), including [sheets](/products/affordable-organic-cotton-sheets), [protectors](/collections/protectors), [duvet covers](/products/organic-cotton-duvet-cover), and [pillowcases](/products/organic-cotton-pillowcase-set), are always with 100% GOTS certified organic cotton or linen (CU863637). That means the material is non-toxic and sustainably grown without pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. You won't find any synthetic fibers, chemical adhesives, or artificial dyes, either \u2014 all of which means our bedding is better for you, our workers, and the planet. Not only that, organic cotton and linen are superior, high-quality materials that are durable, breathable, and soft to the touch. KICK TOXINS OUT OF THE BEDROOM What we put on and against our skin can have a huge impact on our overall health. [Studies show](https://oecotextiles.wordpress.com/2010/11/10/how-to-get-rid-of-chemicals-in-fabrics-hint-trick-question/) that not only do pesticides not wash out of fibers with a few washes, but over time, they can even be released as the cotton fibers begin to degrade. This means that cotton sheets you've had for a while could still be releasing pesticide residues onto your skin \u2014 as much as 42 percent \u2014 even after six washes. These chemicals have been linked to reproductive disorders and cancers, hormonal imbalances, and skin irritations. ORGANIC FARMING IS SAFER Conventional cotton is one of the dirtiest crops on the planet, heavily reliant on pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers. The toxic chemicals used to grow it are linked to higher rates of cancer, asthma, and birth defects where the crop is grown. By using organic cotton and linen, we're protecting our farmers from the hazards of growing conventional cotton. GOTS also validates fair and ethical treatment for the farmers, which results in safer, more sustainable communities. ORGANIC FIBERS REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS AND WATER USE Conventional cotton has an enormous carbon footprint and uses a tremendous amount of water. Organic cotton, on the other hand, uses about 90 percent less water and has about half the carbon footprint of conventional cotton. Avocado is a [Climate Neutral Certified](/pages/climate-neutral) net-zero business, and reducing emissions however we can is essential to mitigating the worst impacts of the climate crisis. NON-TOXIC BEDDING SLEEPS BETTER Our renewable and sustainable bedding delivers a luxurious finish and a breathable membrane. It also wicks away moisture better than any synthetic material. Our organic cotton, hemp, and linen sheets are 100% GOTS certified organic. That means they aren't just a higher-functioning material. Certified organic fibers are held to a stricter standard for environmental and social responsibility. HOW TO CHOOSE SAFE, NON-TOXIC BEDDING To ensure your bedding is actually safe and non-toxic, look for the most trusted independent certifications. The Global Organic Textile Standard and MADE SAFE offer the most rigorous certifications out there. GOTS is the gold standard in environmental and socially responsible textile manufacturing. And [MADE SAFE](/pages/made-safe-non-toxic) is a rigorous scientific screening process that only allows the use of ingredients that are not known or suspected to harm human health, animals, aquatic life, or ecosystems. The certification prohibits all use of harmful substances, such as flame retardants, everywhere in the mattress. All Avocado sheets and duvets are GOTS certified organic and MADE SAFE certified. "}
