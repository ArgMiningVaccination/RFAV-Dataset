A biological preparation that improves immunity to a particular disease such as diphtheria, rubella, measles, mumps, chicken pox and etc. Contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism which is made from weakened (polio), killed forms of microbe (pertussis), its toxin (toxoid) or surface proteins (hepatitis). Can be administered via injections (e.g. MMR) and oral (e.g. rotavirus vaccine) Vaccines must be stored properly in temperature-controlled environment (2-8 degree celcius).How do vaccines prevent diseases? Reduce risk of infection by working with body's natural defences to safely develop immunity to disease When bacteria or viruses invade our bodies, they attack and multiply. This invasion is called an infection, and the infection is what causes illness. Our immune system then has to fight the infection by producing cells that help recognize and fight the same disease in the future. These supplies of cells are called antibodies. Vaccines help develop immunity by imitating an infection, but the 'imitation' infection does not cause illness. Instead it prompt our immune system to develop the same response as a real infection so that our bodies can recognize and fight the vaccine-preventable disease in the future. NATIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL REGULATORY AGENCY (NPRA)Reasons to be vaccinated Vaccine-preventable diseases still exist and can be passed on to those who are not protected by vaccines Vaccines will keep you protected against infections, which potentially could be the leading causes of cancer. E.g. Hepatitis B and HPV Vaccination among community creates herd immunity which protects the children and elderly from deadly infections Vaccine-preventable diseases are expensive and can typically cause five or six missed work days. And some diseases such as hepatitis A can cause average lose of a month of work General Reactions after Vaccination Injection site reactions (pain, swelling and redness) Fever Others (shivering, fatigue, headache, muscle and joint pains Critical Reactions to be aware of Coughing; wheezing Dizziness, Rashes and swelling Runny or stuffy nose Shortness of breath Vomiting and diarrheaIf you experience any allergic reaction, below are some potential symptoms: GET IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY OF THE ALLERGY SYMPTOMS MENTIONED ABOVEPlease report any side effects you find troubling, even if you are not certain if it is due to a medicine or vaccine. You may REPORT directly to the NPRA using the ConSERF form at: http://www.npra.gov.my > Consumers > Reporting > Reporting Side Effects to Medicines (ConSERF) or Vaccines (AEFI)5. What about vaccines and autism? The 1998 study which raised concerns about a possible link between measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism was later found to be seriously flawed and fraudulent. There is no evidence of a link between MMR vaccine and autism or autistic disorders. 6. Is vaccination allowed in Islam? Yes. Vaccination is a prevention step from severe infectious diseases that causes death. Vaccination is not for an individual's need, but it is already a necessity in the society these days.FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 1. With adequate levels of hygiene, sanitation and clean water, is there still a need for vaccination? Vaccines are necessary and good hygiene, sanitation, clean water, and nutrition are insufficient for stopping infectious diseases. If we don't maintain optimum immunisation, the diseases prevented by vaccination will return. 2. Are vaccines safe? Vaccines are safe. Any licensed vaccine is checked before it is approved, and regularly reassessed on the market. Scientists are also constantly monitoring for signs of adverse events. Most vaccine reactions are usually minor and temporary, like sore arm or mild fever. 3. Do vaccines provide better immunity than natural infections? Vaccines interact with the immune system to produce an immune response same as produced by the natural infection, but they do not cause the disease or put the immunised person at risk of further complications. 4. Do I need to be protected against influenza through vaccination? Yes. It is the best way to reduce your chances of severe flu and of spreading it to others and it has been used for more than 60 years. "}
