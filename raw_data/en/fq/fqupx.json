G. V AN D RIESCHE AND S. L YON Department of Entomology, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 The Trialeurodes vaporariorum Westwood continue to be the most important in- sect pests in commercial poinsettia ( Euphorbia pulcherrrima Willd. ex Koltz) production in the northeastern United States. Most crops are chem-ically treated to suppress whiteflies, either pre-ventatively with pot applications at planting ofthe systemic insecticide imidacloprid (Mara-thon\u00ae) or, later in the crop cycle, with foliage ap-plications of various other insecticides. In the fallof 2000, a survey of 22 Massachusetts poinsettiagrowers found they used an average of 8.3 pesti-cide applications for this pest, at a cost of $0.14 \u00b1$0.02 (SE) per plant (Van Driesche et al. 2002).Signicantly, only 7 of 22 growers were able toachieve full season whitefly suppression withonly the use of Marathon\u00ae at planting; the other15 growers all needed to apply additional foliarpesticides later. As an alternative approach, the use of parasi- toids for suppression of whiteflies in poinsettiacrops has been developed over the past decade(Hoddle and Van Driesche 1996, 1999a,b; Hoddleet Unlikemost implementation of augmentative biologicalcontrol, the release pattern and rate was not basedon testimonials but rather replicated controlledresearch trials in experimental and commercialgreenhouses. This research considered three parasiotids ( Eretmocercus eremicus Rose and Zolnerowich), three release patterns (constant, front end loaded and back end loaded)and three release rates (3, 1 and 0.5 females perplant per week), as well as in combination with in-sect growth regulators. Cost of use, while at rstuneconomical ($2.70 per plant per season) was re-duced steadily through research and changes inproduct price, reaching $0.25 per plant (includingthe cost of shipping) (Van Driesche et al. 2002), a93% reduction in cost. Here, we report results of the rst large scale commercial adoption of this biological control pro-gram, which was implemented by one of the larg-est Massachusetts poinsettia growers in 2002 onthe grower's initiative. A single large greenhousewith 15,408 potted plants (wholesale value,$77,737) was managed through releases of E. eremicus (purchased from Syngenta) released at 0.5 females per stem. Whitefly populationswere monitored in alternate weeks by staff of ourlaboratory and an employee of the producer, usingthe same protocol as employed in Van Driesche et al. (2002). The grower purchased, received, andreleased his own parasitoids. Here we report onthe degree of suppression obtained and the degreeof grower satisfaction with the outcome in termsof crop quality and production cost. We also dis-cuss management errors that occurred and howthey affected the ease of maintaining biologicalcontrol. The greenhouse range under biological control management was divided into east and westblocks that were separated by an internal spacefor movement of machinery. Both sections werephysically inside one very large greenhouse(23,520 ft 2 = 2219 m 2 ). The trial began 9 Septem- ber, 2002 when the range was lled with un-treated plants (potted in mid-August in anothergreenhouse), which were immediately sampled tomeasure whitefly density. The trial ended 4 De-cember, once the majority of plants had been re-moved for sale. A total of 14,625 plants wereinitially placed under biological control, 7894 inthe east and 6731 in the west blocks. Approxi-mately 16 October, the grower introduced an ad-ditional 783 \"Winter Rose\" poinsettia plants froma different greenhouse, for a nal total of 15,408plants in the test area. This variety has crumpledbracts, creating a false rose appearance. Theseplants had not been treated with Marathon\u00aeprior to their introduction into the biological con-trol area and were highly infested with whiteflies(4.2 \u00b1 1.1 SE live nymphs and pupae per leafwhen introduced). These plants were placed as agroup on the far west side and acted as an undes-ired source of adult whiteflies for the remainder ofthe plants in the test greenhouse, especially thosein the west block. In the east block, 6 parasitoid releases were made, in weeks 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (on 25 September;16, 23 and 30 October; and 6 and 13 November, re-spectively) and three insect growth regulator ap-plications (using Enstar II\u00ae because Precision\u00ae,the material used in our previous tests, was nolonger available) were made in weeks 4, 5, and 9(2 and 10 October and 5 November). These appli-cations were timed to suppress whiteflies at mid-crop but before bract coloration. (We did not rec-ommend the third treatment, which was only ap-plied by the grower because the other half of thegreenhouse was being treated). Whiteflies weresuppressed below the at-harvest target thresholdof 2.0 live nymphs and pupae per leaf for the en-tire cropping period and at harvest had 1.1 \u00b1 0.1SE live nymphs and pupae per leaf (Fig. 1). 482 Florida Entomologist 86(4) December 2003 West block was lled with plants one week be- fore east block. The grower made 8 parasitoid re-leases, in weeks 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,11 (on 18 and 25September; 16, 23, and 30 October; and 6, 13 and20 November, respectively). Enstar II was appliedthree times, in weeks 4, 5, and 9 on the same datesas East block. West block whitefly counts exceededthe target threshold (2.0) on two dates each in Oc-tober and November and had 4.0 \u00b1 0.5 SE livenymphs and pupae per leaf at sale on 4 December(Fig. 1). Higher whitefly densities in West blockwere caused in large measure by the introductionon 16 October of the \"Winter Rose\" plants. Theedge of the block in contact with the \"Winter Rose\"plants was the most strongly affected. At harvest,west block plants exceeded our target threshold,but grower assessment of plant quality was favor-able and plants were readily sold.\"Winter Rose\" plants, which were placed next to the west block plants on 16 October, were alsosampled weekly. These plants had 4.2 \u00b1 1.1 SE live nymphs and pupae per leaf when introduced,but this increased to 6.4 \u00b1 2.4 SE within 1 week.We immediately recommended treatment with Marathon\u00ae, as removal to another greenhousewas not possible. Marathon\u00ae was not applied un- til 30 October. In addition, this block of plants wastreated twice with foliar applications of EnstarII\u00ae (10 October and 6 November), even though itwas difcult to obtain effective coverage. At har- vest, this group of plants had 3.8 \u00b1 0.5 SE livenymphs and pupae per leaf. Costs of the parasitoid releases (inclusive of shipping) and the IGR applications for the eastand west blocks were $0.10 per plant and $0.14, re-spectively. This was based on the application of twopackages of 10,000 E. eremicus pupae on each re- lease date. This number of pupae and the numbersof plants in the test greenhouse, together with anassumed 50/50 sex ratio and 70% emergence rate,suggests a parasitoid release rate of ca. 0.45 fe-males per plant was achieved. The price for biolog-ical control in this trial is lower than in previoustrials because fewer total applications were made,in part because the grower did not start the biolog-ical control program until ca 3 weeks after plant-ing, and applied an IGR in 3 weeks (rather than 2as recommended), thus reducing the number ofparasitoid applications in his 15 week crop from anexpected 13 to actual 6-8. However, it is notewor-thy that even this reduced frequency maintainedcontrol, in the absence of a source of whitefly-con-taminated plants (i.e., the \"Winter Rose\" plants). The per plant cost of whitefly control in this crop ($0.10 to $0.14 for the parasitoids, includingshipping, and the IGR applications) compares to$0.14 for chemical control (exclusive of labor) forthe same grower in 2001, when he applied Mara-thon\u00ae and nine other pesticides (one or moreapplications of each) to suppress whiteflies inthe same greenhouse. An exit interview with the grower found a high level of satisfaction with the biological controlprogram. Production of this crop (as part of aMassachusetts extension effort to assist growersinterested in implementing biological controlmeasures) has demonstrated that sufcient infor-mation exists for northeast poinsettia growers tobe successful in use of biological control for white-fly management and produce crops that meet thetarget threshold for whitefly suppression, withconsequent good market acceptance. Costs werealso acceptable to the grower relative to his pastneed for application of ten different pesticideproducts in a comparable crop in the previousyear. This is the rst published demonstration ofsuccessful implementation of biological in poin-settia in the United States at a price competitivewith pesticides, meeting fully all grower concerns. Fig. 1. Densities of live whiteflies per leaf in poinset- tia in three parts of a greenhouse managed with re-leases of the parasitoid Eretmocerus eremicus near Boston, Massachusetts in 2002. Scientic Notes 483 S UMMARY Releases of Eretmocerus eremicus at the re- duced rate of 0.5 females per plant per week, com-bined with three mid-season applications of theinsect growth regulator kinoprene (Enstar II),successfully argen- tifolii ) at or below threshold (2 per leaf), barring management errors (introduction of highly in-fested plants). This program had a cost of $0.10-0.14 per plant, including the cost of the pesticide,the parasitoids and their shipping. This price wasequal to or lower than the average cost of chemi-cal control ($0.14 per plant) for 22 Massachusettspoinsettia growers whose pesticide applicationrecords were examined in a separate survey. Thistrial demonstrates that effective whitefly biologi-cal control on poinsettia can be achieved in thenortheastern United States at prices competitivewith current pesticide use.
