Purification Program FAQs By following the Standard Process Purification Program, you will be working toward sustained, long-term weight management. The ideal weight-management system is not a quick fix - it's a long-term commitment. You will need to make lifestyle changes that will continue long after the purification process has been completed. Here are some tips to help you stay on track: - Plan your strategy before you leave home. - When choosing a restaurant, select one that serves foods on the recommended list. This will curb temptation. - When traveling, bring along a cooler packed with water bottles, fresh fruit, and sliced raw vegetables. - When attending a social gathering, bring a dish to pass that fits your stage of the program, like a fruit/veggie tray or chicken kabobs. - For added convenience, SP Complete and Whey Pro Complete are available in single-serving packets. These vegetables were selected for their high nutritive value and their capacity to support detoxification. You may be fatigued because your body may require a higher amount of protein during purification and post-purification. Ask your health care professional about adding [Whey Pro Complete](/products/whey-pro-complete) to your program. Remember to drink plenty of water, at least 64 ounces per day. Eat plenty of vegetables and fruits with high fiber content. Eating one beet daily encourages regular bowel movements. Whey is a protein source found in [SP Complete](/products/sp-complete), and lactose is a nutrient found in the whey. There is approximately \u00bd gram of lactose per shake. Try [SP Complete Dairy Free](/products/sp-complete-dairy-free) if lactose is a concern. It is vegetarian (lacto-ovo) but not vegan. If you suspect you are having a reaction to a specific food, refrain from eating it, and consult your health care professional about how to incorporate alternative food sources. You and your health care professional should work together during post-purification. Your health care professional may recommend supplements that are specific to your health concern. "}
