Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The accounting policies of the State of Arizona (State) are in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) as applicable to governmental units and are c onsistent with the Arizona Revised Statutes. Although accounts are separately maintained for each fund in th e accompanying financial statements, funds that have similar characteristics have been combined into fund types . The following is a summary of the more significant accounting policies: A. Fund Accounting The accounts of the State are organized on the basis of funds a nd account groups, each of which is considered a separate accounting entity. The operations of each fund are ac counted for with a separate set of self-balancing accounts that comprise its assets, liabilities, fund equity, re venues, and expenditures or expenses. They are grouped into three broad fund categories as follows: GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS GENERAL FUND A self-balancing set of accounts used to account for all financial resources except those required to be accounted for in another fund. SPECIAL REVENUE FUNDS A self-balancing set of accounts used to account for the proceeds of specific revenue sources (other than expendable trusts) that are legally restricted to expenditures for specified purposes. OTHER GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS A self-balancing set of accounts used to account for other government financial resources except those required to be accounted for i n the General Fund or designated as Special Revenue Funds. PROPRIETARY FUNDS ENTERPRISE FUNDS A self-balancing set of accounts used to acco unt for operations that are financed and operated in a manner similar to private business e nterprises. INTERNAL SERVICE FUNDS A self-balancing set of accounts used to account for the financing of goods and services provided by one department to other state departme nts of governments. PERMANENT AND FIDUCIARY FUNDS PERMANENT FUNDS A self-balancing set of accounts used to accou nt primarily for activity related to grants made to the State for schools and public institutions . FIDUCIARY FUNDS A self-balancing set of accounts used to accou nt for assets held by the State in a trustee capacity or as an agent for individuals, private o rganizations and other governments. B. Basis of Accounting All Funds are reported on a cash basis of accounting in accorda nce with State law. Under the cash basis of accounting, revenues and expenditures are recognized when recor ded in the State's central accounting system, the Arizona Financial Information System (AFIS). No allowance has been made to revenues or expenditures for unrecorded accounts receivable, accounts payable, deferred reve nue or any other balance sheet item. Disbursements of appropriated monies, including related operati ng transfers, are reported as expenditures. The commitment for continuing appropriations is reported as a reser vation of Fund Balance. STATE OF ARIZONA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2008 394Note 1. - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued ) C. Reporting Entity The accompanying General Fund cash basis financial statements i nclude transactions of the following funds and accounts: General Fund - General Operations Department of Revenue Excise and Transaction Privilege Tax Fu nd Disproportionate Share Fund Veterans' Nursing Home Fund Budget Stabilization Fund School Accountability Account (Proposition 301) English Language Learner Account D. Budgets and Appropriations Accounting The State follows these procedures in establishing the budgetar y data reflected in the financial statements: 1. Annually the Governor submits to the Legislature a proposed operating and capital outlay budget for the fiscal year commencing the following July 1. This document inclu des proposed expenditures and the means of financing them. Some agency budgets are approved for two fiscal years at a time on a biennial cycle. 2. Public hearings are then conducted during legislative sessio ns. 3. Prior to July 1, the budget is enacted through passage and a pproval of bills containing appropriations. 4. Appropriation accounting is then employed as a management to ol to monitor the appropriated monies. E. Rounding Differences The information shown in the Statement of Expenditures - Approp riation to Actual, has been rounded to the nearest dollar and therefore, minor differences may be found wh en adding the columns down or the rows across. The rounding differences are inconsequential. Note 2. - Description of Financial Statements A. The accompanying financial statements include a balance shee t and statements of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balance for the General Fund. B. The Statement of Expenditures - Appropriation to Actual, Bud getary (Legal) Basis is presented for all appropriations. The Capital Outlay Statement of Expenditures - Appropriation to Actual includes all capital appropriations for the General Fund and the Capital Outlay Stab ilization Fund. C. Since there was a substantial amount of appropriation adjust ments as the State addressed budgetary concerns, a supplemental schedule providing additional detail o n Supplemental Appropriations and Adjustments for the General Fund has been included in this repo rt. Administrative Adjustments are shown as Note 8 to the financial statements. D. The General Fund is presented prominently in the Annual Fina ncial Report (AFR) due to its significance. The Statement of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balance is presented for all other funds accounted for on the AFIS. The statement includes beginning and ending b alances for the current fiscal year as well as appropriated and non-appropriated activity in each fund. See Not e 4 for additional detail on this Statement. STATE OF ARIZONA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2008 395Note 3. - Statement of Expenditures - Budgetary to Actual - Des cription of Selected Columns A. Supplemental Appropriations and Adjustments The column titled Supplemental Appropriations, Mid-Year Reversi ons and Adjustments shown on the Statement of Expenditures - Appropriations to Actual includes the following: Supplemental and Special Appropriations which are either the ad ditional spending authority (appropriation) granted by the Legislature after an original appropriation is a pproved or other Session Law appropriations granted by the Legislature to a State agency or department for a specific program or purpose. Transfers and adjustments which are the movements of monies or spending authority between funds, departments, programs and within programs in accordance with th e Arizona Revised Statutes. Mid-year reversions (when applicable) are the returning of spen ding authority (appropriation) originally granted to a State agency or department through the appropriation proce ss prior to the completion of the granted spending period. B. Lapsed Appropriations In accordance with A.R.S. \u00a7 35-190, except as otherwise provide d by law, all appropriations lapse after the close of the fiscal year. The unused spending authority (appropriation) which was originally granted to a State agency or department through the appropriation process expires. The term \"reversion\" is sometimes used in reference to these lapsed appropriations. The amount of lapsed appropriatio ns from the General Fund for FY08 is $196,187,072 from General Operations and $22,182 from Capital O utlay. C. Continuing Appropriations A continuing appropriation is a spending authority that, once e stablished, is automatically renewed without further legislative action, period after period, until altered or revok ed. In the State of Arizona, continuing appropriations are primarily for construction or other projects that take longer t han one year to complete. The total General Fund continuing appropriations of $88,942,465 includes $70,671,891 f rom General Operations and $18,270,574 from Capital Outlay. Note 4. - Budget Stabilization Fund A.R.S. \u00a7 35-144 established the Budget Stabilization Fund (BSF) in 1990. The BSF is sometimes referred to as the rainy day fund. The purpose of the BSF is to normalize (over t ime) the fluctuations of the State's high and low growth rates. The amount of cash transferred to or from the BS F and the General Fund - General Operations is established by statutory formula. No operating expenditures ma y occur in the BSF. Interest earned on pooled investments with the State Treasurer is the basic revenue sourc e of the BSF. Pursuant to Laws 2008, Chapter 53, Section 2.A.104, $487.000 mi llion was transferred from the BSF to the General Operating Fund in FY08. Additionally, in Section 26.A of the same chapter, an amount equal to the negative ending balance of the State General Fund plus $1 milli on was to be transferred. The subsequent transfer of $73.208 million was processed in November of 2008 in the AFI S and is accordingly reflected in these statements pursuant to law. The FY08 ending balance for the BSF is $147.2 12 million. The ending balance has been reflected as Restricted for Budget Stabilization Fund on the ba lance sheet, with a corresponding amount being included in Cash and Investments with the State Treasurer. Acc ordingly, the net decrease to the BSF for FY08 was approximately $526.319 million.STATE OF ARIZONA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2008 396Note 5. - Statement of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fu nd Balance Laws 2005, 1st Regular Session, Chapter 331, Section 4, amending A.R.S. \u00a7 35- 131.E, requires the AFR to include all appropriated and non-appropriated monies. The General Fund is presented prominently in the AFR due to its significance. In accordance with the revised statute, the Stat ement of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balance presents appropriated and non-appropriated activit y for all other funds accounted for on the AFIS as well as beginning and ending balances for each fund. As requir ed, this report includes non-appropriated activity in the same detail as the General Fund. The Statement includes ap propriated activity when applicable for each fund, but summarized within a single line item labeled \"Appropriated Activity.\" During the course of the report compilation, a number of funds with negative balances were noted. No analysis of the accounts that comprise the negative balances was conducted as to the cause or the resolution. On the Fund Balance Report, the various balance sheet accounts culminating in the negative balance are listed only for those funds. The following funds were noted with negative balances: OTHER GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS: Federal Grant Fund - Governor's Office of Highway Safety (GHA 2000) Arizona State Board of Nursing (BNA 2000) Department of Environmental Quality (EVA 2000) Inter-governmental and Interagency Service Agreement Fund - Off ice of Administrative Hearings (HGA 2500) Department of Environmental Quality (EVA 2500) Estate and Unclaimed Property Fund - Department of Revenue (RVA 1520) Developmental Disabilities Fund - Department of Economic Securi ty (DEA 3145) Special Program Payroll Trust Fund - Arizona Historical Society (HIA 3159) SPECIAL REVENUE FUNDS: Attorney General Liability Defense Fund - Attorney General (AGA 2164) Tobacco Tax Fund - Department of Revenue (RVA 1309) Game and Fish Kaibab Co-op Fund - Arizona Game and Fish Departm ent (GFA 3714) ENTERPRISE FUNDS: Arizona Exposition and State Fair Fund - AZ Exposition and Stat e Fair Board (CLA 4001) INTERNAL SERVICE FUNDS: Motor Pool Revolving Fund - Arizona Department of Administratio n (ADA 4204) FIDUCIARY FUNDS: Administrative Fund - State Treasurer (TRA 3736) Local Transportation Assistance Fund - State Treasurer (TRA 374 7) County Assistance Fund - State Treasurer (TRA 3751) Developmental Disabilities Fund - Department of Economic Securi ty (DEA 3146) Racing Commission Bond Deposit Fund - Arizona Department of Rac ing (RCA 3720) Big Game Permit Fund - Arizona Game and Fish Department (GFA 37 12) For management reporting purposes, certain accrual adjustments are recorded in the AFIS. This activity is consistent with the statutory or legal basis upon which the AFR is prepared and has not been modified. Current year adjustments to prior year accruals, such as refunds of pri or year's expenditures or adjustments to long-term debts or receivables, are reflected in the Fund Balance report as an adjustment to the beginning fund balance. Additionally, other entries are current year transactions and a re shown as GAAP Revenue and GAAP Expenditure Offsets. Revenue offsets are frequently the result of adjustme nts to amounts recorded as due to other funds. Expenditure offsets are most commonly related to depreciation a nd adjustment of fixed assets. GAAP Revenue and GAAP Expenditure Offsets are recorded in the Fund Balance R eport in their respective revenue and expenditure columns. Furthermore, a number of funds have year- end cash balances on the AFIS, but other balance sheet accounts off-set the cash resulting in a net fund balance of zero. This occurs most commonly with the Credit Card Clearing Fund.STATE OF ARIZONA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2008 397Note 5. - Statement of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fu nd Balance (Continued) Fund activity in the Fund Balance Report is shown on the statew ide fund level. Some funds have activity with more than one agency and the report separates the activity within th e fund by agency. Funds with activity in more than one section are listed in both sections and cross-referenced. For comparison purposes and consistency with the Statement of Expenditures - Appropriation to Actual, the Depart ment of Economic Security Federal Grant Fund has not been combined on a statewide level. Detail is provided for each separate grant type. Note 6. - ADOT Board Funding Obligations A.R.S. \u00a7 28-7678 authorizes the Transportation Board to deliver non-negotiable Board funding obligations and requires the State Treasurer to purchase the obligations. Howeve r, if operating monies in the State General Fund fall below an $800 million average over the previous twelve con secutive months, the State Treasurer is not required to purchase Transportation Board funding obligations. The boar d funding obligation principal amount shall not be more than $200 million and mature no later than four calendar y ears after delivery of the obligations. As of June 30, 2008, the total amount outstanding is $110 million. The mon ies derived from the Board funding obligations are to be made available for the state highway fund (up to $60 mill ion) and the highway expansion and extension loan program (up to $140 million). A.R.S. \u00a7 35-313 allows the State Treasurer to call the investme nt in the Transportation Board funding obligations if operating monies fall below $200 million. The Transportation B oard shall repay the obligations from its available resources and may reissue them under the same terms and conditi ons that they were originally issued. STATE OF ARIZONA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2008 398 Note 7. - Combining Financial Statements The following schedules provide additional detail related to th e combination of fund information for financial statement presentation.
