She has been there on the hardest and darkest times in my life, helping me to stay grounded, helping me to create resilience, to not only survive the darkness but to actually grow from it. With the richness of colours, art, stories and fairytales, with the wisdom of a woman who is walking the land, with care, non-judgemental acceptance, rare sensitivity and open heart, she guides me on my path to become healthier and stronger, to rebuild my life, to listen to my inner call and reach my fullest potential in my vocational journey, to trust my journey as a mother and seek truth on my spiritual path.\" Sh. G. \"I have learned a lot about myself during your sessions and I am beginning to value what I am doing and creating with a more loving way of looking at it.!\" S. G. \"I was able to see Karin within a good time frame when I was most at need, and she supported the urgency to get started on the work and gave me invaluable ideas to help in daily life. I will forever be grateful for Karin's help.\" L. F. \"My overall sense with the art therapy was of working with focus and relevance to what was present in the conversation and in life itself. When I started out initially on this mini-journey with Karin, my intention was of wanting to get better at art and be more creative in my life. As the sessions progressed, I realised this was not really the point, and nor was self- development the issue that mattered. Remembering my Sufi background, this self-approach can all too easily be seen to be taking energy away from the bigger picture, from the Oneness that underpins everything and is gifted. What mattered more was pointing out undeveloped areas, shining a fresh light on old beliefs that I was still holding onto. Karin also tuned into my undercurrents of anger and resentment as I scratched too firmly on the paper for example. But the most deep-rooted trait was buying into old tapes that I should have been more successful at university and pursued a career-path, carving out a high-status position in the law. I most likely would have been less in touch with nature, and the wondrous yet difficult world we live in. One of my earliest projects was painting the relationship between the moon and Venus in the luminous dark night sky in the Californian dusk as I had marvelled at the mathematical precision of their relative movements over 3 successive evenings. Karin is warm-hearted, caring yet also grounded in a self-possessed way; she is her own woman and her listening comes from a deep place. She is decisive when deciding where a session needs to go or about a particular interpretation of a stream of events. I found myself feeling supported and trusting in those interpretations eg that not having a pin-stripe suit is something to be grateful for, rather than rue this fact as a failure.\" K. W. \"The best thing I learned from Karin is to believe in my own power and to confront the obstacles gracefully, with my head high. I have the tolerance to embrace the imperfections, the courage to fight for my real needs and the strength to carry out my plans. I wouldn't have become myself now if I hadn't met Karin.\" L. N. "}
