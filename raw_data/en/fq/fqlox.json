Introduction Allergic rhinitis is a type of disease with high worldwide incidence.1-3The International Study of Asthma and Allergiesin Childhood (ISAAC) released studies showing prevalence rates of allergic rhinitis among Brazilian children and ado- lescents The relevance of allergic rhinitis is unquestionable. This condition affects people 's quality of life and its incidence has increased over the last years. Objective Thus, this study aims to analyze the effectiveness of subcutaneous injectable immunotherapy in cases of nasalcongestion in allergic rhinitis patients.Methods In the present study, the same researcher analyzed the records of 281 patients. Furthermore, the researchers identi ed allergens through puncture cutaneous tests using standardized extracts containing acari, fungi, pet hair, flower pollen, and feathers. Then, the patients underwent treatment with subcutaneous speci c immu- notherapy, using four vaccine vials for desensitization, associated with environmentalhygiene. The authors analyzed conditions of nasal itching, sneeze, rhinorrhea, and nasalcongestion throughout the treatment, and assigned them with a score ranging fromzero (0), meaning absence of these symptoms to three (3), for severe cases. Thesymptoms were statistically compared in the beginning, during, and after treatment.Results In this study, authors analyzed the cases distribution according to age and the evolution of symptomatology according to the scores, comparing all phases of treatment. The average score for the entire population studied was 2.08 beforetreatment and 0.44 at the end. These results represent an overall improvement of/C2479% in symptomatology of allergic rhinitis in the studied population. Conclusion The subcutaneous immunotherapy as treatment of allergic rhinitis led to a reduction in all symptoms studied, improving the quality of life of patients, proving itselfas an important therapeutic tool for these pathological conditions. received July 15, 2014accepted July 5, 2015 published online October 7, 1809-9777.Copyright \u00a9 2016 Janeiro, Brazil Original ResearchTHIEME 6 Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) project classi es allergic rhinitis as a risk factor for the development of asthma, alerting to its impact on quality of life and high social costs.5-7The ARIA project also proposed a new classi- cation to allergic rhinitis severity, replacing the terms perennial and seasonal rhinitis with mild, moderate or severe intensity, persistent or intermittent. In the United States, it is estimated that 30 million people suffer from allergic rhinitis,causing high absenteeism, which corresponds to more than 3.8 billion dollars per year in nancial costs. 3,8 In addition, there is evidence that allergic rhinitis is frequently undertreated, mainly in its moderate and se- vere/intense persistent forms.6,9The management of patients with allergic rhinitis involves pharmacological including allergen cated for patients with refractory symptoms, being consid-ered the only treatment capable of modifying the course of allergic rhinitis and asthmas. However, less than 5% of allergic patients have undergone immunotherapy, mainly due to thelong term for treatment and allergy side effects, which demonstrates the complexity of this therapy. Moreover, different authors show that the actual bene cial effects and security of immunotherapy remain unclear. 2,11 -15One option for such cases could be the use of interleukin 5 (IL-5). This cytokine relates to the suppression of the allergens 'synthesis, demonstrating the possible clinical ef ciency of immuno- therapy.14,16Thus, the use of this therapy in respiratory allergies can be an attempt at inactivation of allergen-speci c Th1 and Th2 cells, decreasing the production of IgE in B lymphocytes, modulating the immune response.10 Objective Therefore, the aim of this retrospective study is to analyze the effectiveness of an injectable immunotherapy in cases of nasal itching, sneeze, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion in allergic rhinitis patients. Materials and Methods In the current study, the authors analyzed 281 patient records, independent of seasons, at the beginning and end of treatment, attended to over 11 years, of both genders, aged3 to 69 years old, with a clinical diagnosis of allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma associated, without other apparent allergic etiologies. The researchers diagnosed patients with positive puncture cutaneous tests, using standardized extracts containing acari, fungi, pet hair, flower pollen, and feathers. After diagnosis, the patients received speci c desensitizing vaccines of Aler- gofar\u00ae (puri ed allergens, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil) at a private practice in the city of Jundia\u00ed, S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil.The study was approved by Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine of Jundia\u00ed (process number 127/2007 -Jundia\u00ed, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil). The identity of all patients was preserved. The allergic rhinitis symptoms analyzed in this study were: itching, sneezing, watery rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion. The same researcher and examiner, in the same of ce,quanti ed these conditions according to signs and symptoms proposed by some authors, and modi ed for this report throughout the entire study period. The scoring was as follows: Zero (0) \u00bcabsence of symptom; 1 \u00bcmild symptoms: occasional itching and sneezing, nasal rhinorrhea, and/or secretion sensation in the throat and/or occasional nasal congestion; 2 \u00bcmoderate symptoms: itching and sneezing several times per day, rhinorrhea several times per day and/or frequent throat clearing, and nasal congestion with buccal breathing; 3 \u00bcsevere/intense symptoms: itching and ing interfering with daily activities, constant nasal rhinor- rhea, and coughing and/or speech alteration, buccal breathing with interference of sleep, and damage in sense of odors dueto nasal congestion. The researchers obtained ve mean scores per symptom for each patient: at the beginning of treatment, and at the endof the rst, second, third, and fourth vaccine dose. Any subsequent booster treatments were disregarded. The re- searcher performed skin prick tests in the forearm of allpatients. Equipment for orotracheal intubation and ventila- tion were always available. In this analysis, the authors observed patients 'reactions to house pet hair, flower pollen, wool, and feathers. The hista- mine was used as a positive control and the response to saline solution (0.9%) as a negative control. Any others forms weredened as positive responses. The responses in relation to histamine were also classi ed as mild, moderate, and severe/ intense, similar to those described in literature. 17 Patients were included according to the following inclu- sion criteria: 1) age over 3 years; 2) clinical symptoms compatible with those for allergic rhinitis/asthma; 3) dis- ease that had not been responsive to conventional treat- ments, including environmental control; 4) positive skintests; 5) possibility of having received speci cd e s e n s i t i z a - tion treatment; 6) vaccines received of the same origin; 7) underwent only subcutaneous treatment; 8) use of fourvials of allergen extracts re-suspended in aluminum hydrox- ide at increasing concentrations. The study 's exclusion cri- teria were: 1) younger than 3 years old; 2) patients withuncertain diagnosis (with mildly allergic rhinitis); 3) good response to conventional treatments; 4) discontinued treat- ment; 5) patients who did not attend the clinical visits; and6) patients hypersensitive to the vaccine components; 7) rhinitis due to other causes. The sample can be considered representative of the studied population, as it takes intoaccount similar socio-economic levels of good standing, good housing conditions, access to health services, and appropriate nutrition. All treated patients received detailedwritten recommendations for environmental control and hygiene, food for a dye-free diet and an acaricidal solution containing benzyl benzoate to control acari, all ofthem standardized to avoid in fluence over the outcome. During treatment, patients were not allowed to use drugs, such as: steroidal anti-in flammatory, acetylsalicylic acid, International Archives of 20 No. 1/2016Subcutaneous Immunotherapy Improves th e Symptomatology of Allergic Rhinitis Louren\u00e7o al. 7 antihistamines, oral decongestants, or corticosteroids, ex- cept in cases of acute episodes or when prescribed andmonitored by the main researcher. All patients received instructions to report the use of any medication during therapy and answered questions concerning this in theperiodical reassessment visits. The applied vaccine was always the Alergofar\u00ae (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). The total period of treatment was 14 months.Therst vial (doses) contained a weak concentration of allergens (0.008 skin reactivity units [SRU]) administered at intervals of 7 days (8 increasing doses of 0.1 to 0.8ml). Thesecond vial contained a medium concentration of allergens (0.08 SRU) applied at intervals of 10 days (8 increasing doses of 0.1 to 0.8ml). The third vial contained a strong concentra-tion of allergens (0.8 SRU) and was administered at intervals of 14 days (8 increasing doses of 0.1 to 1.0ml). The fourth vial contained an extra-strong concentration (8 SRU) and wasadministered at intervals of 21 days divided into 9 doses (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.0, and 1.0ml). The patients were consistently monitored for 15 -30 minutes after each admin- istration. 18They underwent reassessment after the end of each vaccine vial. In case of an acute episode of rhinitis exacerbation, the researchers administered oral antihist-amines for a few days. According to literature, this common approach does not alter the results or the evaluation of treatment ef cacy. Moreover, for control purposes, the re- searchers always evaluated the patients after administering this drug. 19 Statistical Analysis The authors compared results statistically during the entire treatment and reported the mean, median, and values range.They applied the Wilcoxon test to evaluate the difference between the symptom scores (nasal itching, sneezing, rhinor- rhea, and nasal congestion) before, during and after vaccine therapy. A level of signi cance of 5% was adopted. Data were analyzed using the SAS 9.1 software (USA). Results The population studied was of 281 patients, including 167 (59.4%) males and 114 (40.6%) females, totaling 8,992 appli- cations performed. There was no signi cant difference in relation to gender. Ages ranged from 3 to 69 years old, with a mean in relation to\"n\"of 17.4 /C611.7 years. Approximately 50% of the sample was younger and over 50% was older than 14.4 years (medi- an), as seen in Table 1 . In the results, it is also possible to observe the incidence of each symptom of allergic rhinitis at four levels of intensity in the population studied ( n\u00bc281) before treatment with speci c desensitizing vaccines. Fig. 1 shows mean symptom scores before treatment. The overall mean score corresponds to the sum of all individ- ual symptom scores divided by the number of patientsstudied ( n\u00bc281), and then divided by four, which represents the number of symptoms evaluated during each stage of desensitization treatment.The mean scores at the end of vaccine therapy are shown in Figs. 2 ,3,4,a n d 5, respectively. Table 2 summarizes the mean score of each symptom of allergic rhinitis before treatment and at the end of immunotherapy. The authors observed signi cant differences among the four symptoms studied between the beginning and the end of immunotherapy ( p<0.05; Wilcoxon test). With respect to itching, there were signi cant differences ( p<0.05) found in all stages of treatment, except between the second and third vial ( p\u00bc0.225). The mean initial score (1.89 /C61.20) was signicantly higher than the nal score (0.35 /C60.69; p<0.001). There were also signi cant differences ( p<0.05) pertain- ing to sneezing in all stages of treatment, except between thesecond and third vial ( p\u00bc0.196). The mean initial score (2.27 /C60.97) was signi higher than the nal also differed sig- nicantly ( p<0.05) between all stages of treatment, except between the rst and second vial ( p\u00bc0.347) and between the second and third vial ( p\u00bc0.2154), but the mean initial of score (1.84 /C61.15) was signi cantly higher than the nal score (0.37 /C60.68, p<0.001).Table 1 Median distribution of the patients by age Age groups (years) Patients \"n\" % 3-6 29 10.3 6-12 91 32.4 12-18 64 22.8 18-24 40 14.2 24-30 15 5.4 30-42 31 11.0 42-54 7 2.5 54-70 4 1.4 Total 281 100 2.5 itching 1.868 sneezing 2.245rhinorrhea 1.840obstruction 2.391overall 2.086 Fig. 1 Mean score in relation to symptom in allergic rhinitis; at the beginning of immunotherapy Otorhinolaryngology Vol. 20 No. 1/2016Subcutaneous Immunotherapy Improves the Symptomatology of Allergic Rhinitis Louren\u00e7o et al. 8 The scores obtained for nasal congestion also differed signicantly ( p<0.05) in all stages, except between the rst and second vial ( p\u00bc0.658) and between the second and third vial ( p\u00bc0.327). The mean initial score (2.41 /C60.97) was signicantly higher than the nal score (0.54 /C60.85; p<0.001). The comparison of total score obtained in combination with the four symptoms, showed signi cant differences (p<0.05) in all stages of treatment, with the mean initial score (8.41 /C62.63), being higher than the nal score (1.75 /C62.03; p<0.001). Discussion In the present study, the researchers did not observe signi - cant differences in relation to gender. The mean age of thepatients was 17.4 /C611.7 years (range of 3 -69 years), with /C2450% of the sample younger and over 50% older than 14.4 years old (median). The majority of patients were children and adolescents. According to literature, the immunotherapy for allergic rhino-conjunctivitis and allergic asthma is moreeffective in children and young adults than in older adults. 10 The researchers used standardized diagnostic and thera- peutic procedures for all patients and analyzed the records,ensuring the study 's condentiality and criteria. Skin tests are recognized as effective and precise tools for the etiological diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. 5,10,14 -17Conrming this, a studythat included 117 patients must be interpreted 15 to 20 minutes after puncture, in an interval that should not be exceeded since skin reactions tend to fade over time.17Anergic patients, or those under the effect of some medications, such assystemic decongestants, cold medicines, and antihistamines, may show negative responses to all allergens tested, including histamine. Systemic or topical corticosteroids do not alter theresult of these skin tests. In addition, in applying these tests, the use of physiological saline is recognized as a negative control and must becompared with all the allergens tested. 17Lastly, desensitiza- tion treatment has been and should always be indicated for patients with symptoms refractory to conventional treat-ments and with the combination of environmental hygiene to reduce exposure to the allergens. 2In the present study, an acaricidal solution containing benzyl benzoate was pre- scribed for environmental hygiene, to reduce the population of mites according to literature. As for desensitizing vaccines, they do not interact with systemic and topical antihistamines, disodium cromoglycate, or corticosteroids because they are not conventional drugs,but extracts of allergens.

Currently, this isconsidered a more ef cient form of immune tolerance induc- tion, compared to that described in 1911. 21This study reports vaccine concentrations as SRU (Standard Reactivity Unit), astandard unit considered ideal for the purpose. The rst vial of vaccine contained a weak concentration of allergens (0.008 SRU), the second presented a medium concentration (0.08SRU), the third presented an elevated concentration (0.8 SRU), and the fourth presented a very elevated concentration (8 SRU). The researchers recorded alterations in symptoms atthe end of each vaccine vial, excluding sporadic doses. 22The equivalence of SRU/milliliter, microgram/milliliter (\u00b5g/ml), and International Units (IU), allow for the comparison withother studies, similar \u00b5g \u00bc10 IU. According to international standards, the minimum concentration at the end of treatment must be 4 IU/ml, equivalent to 2.5 \u00b5g/ml. In the present study, researchers used 2.5 times this concentra- tion, plus the minimum quantity recommended at the end oftreatment. This treatment should be applied subcutaneously; intra- dermal or intramuscular applications are inadequate and canreduce the ef cacy of desensitization treatment. In this respect, a study proposed the injection of allergens in minordoses into the lymph nodes with a short-term treatment. 13 These factors are important in subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT),23as well as the quality of the allergen extract24and time of action. However, the duration of allergen effects is mainly related to individual characteristics, similar to those described in literature, which show rates ranging from 0 - 50%.25 Nonetheless, most studies consider this allergy therapy safe, despite some reports of a potential risk of anaphylaxis,12 episodes of asthma, urticaria, angioedema,13and erythema multiforme.26A prospective, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in patients submitted to depigmentedallergen extract. The patients received four injections of increasing doses at weekly intervals followed by monthly addition dosage, totaling 5,923 doses. In this case, ve pa- tients presented local reactions and 27 presented systemic reactions. 27Some researchers also suggest reducing the dose in cases of local or systemic reaction18and excluding asth- matic patients, since they are particularly vulnerable to adverse reactions.19In the present study, there was no reaction observed in samples. The present study, however, did not exclude asthmatic patients. In fact, it included 63 patients with this condition. The authors did exclude one patient because he presented bronchospasm after each dose applied, even at higher dilu- tions. The responsible researcher and an experienced nurseapplied the injections and, according to literature, consistent- ly had intubation and ventilation equipment available. 19In the present study, the patients were controlled and moni-tored for 15 to 30 minute after each dose administration to detect immediate adverse reactions.

Differently, others studies show the occurrence of reactions after treatment, as well as the need for frequentdrug intervention in 0.13% of cases. 2 In the present results ( Fig. 6 ), most of the patients studied had severe symptoms, which were mainly sneezing and nasalcongestion, followed by itching and rhinorrhea ( Fig. 1 ). After therst dose, nasal congestion was the symptom with the greatest reduction ( Fig. 2 ). Followed by rhinorrhea and nasal congestion in the second dose ( Fig. 3 ), whereas after the third dose, the authors observed improvement of all symptoms (Fig. 4 ). Final data on the improvement of symptoms were demonstrated after the last vaccine dose ( Fig. 5 ). These ndings indicate two important qualitative moments in symp- toms improvement during this immunotherapy: one after ther s td o s ea n dt h eo t h e ra f t e rt h ef o u r t h . Similarly, other studies have shown improvement of symptoms after this treatment. 2,7Immunotherapy has also been used to treat different cases, leading to reduced symp- toms and in the need for medications, aside from a substantial improvement in quality of life. It is indicated to patients thatcannot avoid exposure to allergens and in situations where pharmacologic therapy has not rendered positive results. Speci c immunotherapy to treat allergic rhinitis in elderly patients was ef cient and had no collateral effects. In addition to the clinical bene t, there was also improvement in the cutaneous test. 2,19,22,28 -31 Moreover, with respect to the controversy about the season in which the study is initiated or conducted, this cannot be considered a bias factor in the evaluation ofsymptoms, because all the patients included in the present report were followed in a continuously during treatment, refuting, for example, the seasoned report of 120 patients concretely allergic to grass and rye pollen. 32 Finally, Table 2 shows the comparison of mean scores before and after treatment, also demonstrated by Figs. 1 and 5. The authors calculated the mean score obtained from the four main rhinitis by dividing individual scores by four, inthat the maximum score was three. This resulted in a score of 2,086 in the beginning of treatment and 0.440 after the last vaccine dose, which corresponds to an overall symptomimprovement of 79% in patients with allergic rhinitis with or without asthma. The authors also obtained intermediate scores during treatment, demonstrating the progressive im-provement of symptoms. Signi cant differences ( p<0.05) were observed for all comparisons performed. The mean initial score (8.41 /C62.63) was higher than the nal score (1.75 /C62.03) ( p<0.001). Thus, the study shows that speci c immunotherapy is a relevant approach in blocking the progression of rhinitis andasthma, mainly in selected cases. 4,18,33 Conclusion Subcutaneous immunotherapy demonstrated ef cacy in de- creasing the symptoms of itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea, andnasal congestion in patients with allergic rhinitis, proving to be an important therapeutic tool against this pathologicalcondition.
