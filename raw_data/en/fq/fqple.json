Write in to us at parenting.care@firstcry.com Dandruff, a common scalp condition of flaky skin, can also affect children. It is typically harmless and not a cause for major concern, but it can be bothersome and may cause discomfort or embarrassment for the child as it causes irritation and itching on the scalp. Kids generally play outdoors, making them more susceptible to dust and dust-related skin issues, including dandruff. Parents might want to know if they can use an anti-dandruff shampoo and remove the flakes. But dust is not the only reason why kids could get dandruff. Symptoms of dandruff in children include white or yellowish flakes on the scalp, itching, and a dry or scaly scalp. Sometimes, dandruff can also appear on the eyebrows, eyelashes, or other body parts. These symptoms may come and go, varying in severity from mild to more pronounced. In this article, we shall discuss more about dandruff, its various causes, symptoms and treatment. Read on to know more. What Is Dandruff? Dandruff is dead skin found on the scalp or in a person's hair, normally resulting in white flakes or even itchiness. But serious conditions such as seborrheic dermatitis may occur in some rare cases, leading to scalp inflammation. Below, we shall discuss some more causes of dandruff in children. Causes of Dandruff in Children Various causes of dandruff in kids include- 1. Improper Shampooing Sometimes when we shampoo our kids' hair, dead skin cells, which should have been rinsed, stay back due to improper head washing. This causes an accumulation of dead skin on the scalp, leading to dandruff. 2. Malnutrition [Malnutrition in kids](https://parenting.firstcry.com/articles/malnutrition-in-children-causes-symptoms-remedies/?ref=interlink) is the most common reason for dandruff. Kids prefer to eat more unhealthy snacks or junk food rather than a fully nutritious diet, leading to scalp itching or dandruff. 3. Sensitivity to Hair Products Sometimes, your hair product may not suit your kid well, leading to dandruff issues. Try to change the product, but prefer to do so only after consulting a doctor. 4. Malassezia It is a yeast-like fungus, which, when it grows rapidly, leads to disturbance in the natural growth of cells. This, in turn, leads to dandruff and scalp itching. Certain illnesses or hormonal changes in kids generally are the cause of the emergence of such fungi. 5. Seborrhoeic Dermatitis This disease is also known as eczema, which results in inflammation of the skin. This type of skin disorder does not go away easily, but dandruff is a milder form of this condition in children with less serious implications. 6. Allergic Reactions Children can develop dandruff-like symptoms due to an allergic reaction to certain hair care products, such as shampoos, conditioners, or styling products. Ingredients in these products, such as fragrances or preservatives, may irritate the scalp and lead to flaking. 7. Hormonal Changes Hormonal fluctuations can also affect dandruff development, especially during puberty. These changes can affect the oil production in the scalp, leading to an increased risk of dandruff. Hormonal dandruff is often temporary and tends to improve as the body adapts to the hormonal changes. Dandruff Signs and Symptoms in Children The signs and symptoms of dandruff in children include - - Visible dry white flakes on your child's scalp or outfit. - Presence of oily flakes on the scalp. - Continuous itching of the scalp area. - Red patches on the scalp are either caused due to itching or excessive dandruff. - The combination of dandruff, excess oil, dead skin cells, and certain bacteria or fungi on the scalp can result in an odour. - Dandruff in children can sometimes extend beyond the scalp, leading to flaking in other areas of the body, such as eyebrows, eyelids and face. Can Dandruff Harm the Child's Scalp? In most cases, mild dandruff irritates your child and doesn't affect the scalp area much. But the scalp area gets inflamed and turns red in certain rare cases, like seborrheic dermatitis, eczema, Malassezia or psoriasis. In such cases, consulting a skincare specialist for effective relief is essential. Dandruff Treatment for Kids Are you wondering how to treat dandruff in kids? Here are a few tested and tried methods- 1. Using a Medicated Shampoo The use of medicated shampoo can treat dandruff in kids to a great extent.
