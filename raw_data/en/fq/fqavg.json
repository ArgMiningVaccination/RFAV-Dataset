These tools, called clinical decision support (CDS) algorithms, can be enormously helpful in helping guide health care providers in determining, for example, which antibiotics to prescribe or whether to recommend a risky heart surgery. Monday, July 24, 2023 [Structure of Opioid Receptors May Reveal How to Better Design Pain Relievers, Addiction Therapies](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/news/2023/Structure-of-Opioid-Receptors-May-Reveal-How-to-Better-Design-Pain-Relievers-Addiction-Therapies.html) Opioids remain the most potent and effective pain relievers in medicine, but they're also among the most addictive drugs that can halt a person's ability to breathe during an overdose \u2014 which can be deadly. Researchers have been racing to develop safer pain reliever drugs that target a specific opioid receptor, called the kappa opioid receptor, that is only found in the central nervous system and not elsewhere in the body, like other opioid receptors. Previous research suggests that such drugs may not lead to addiction or death due to overdose, but the currently known drugs that target these kappa opioid receptors have their own set of unacceptable side effects, including depression and psychosis.

Last month, scientists at the University of Maryland School of Medicine's (UMSOM) Institute for Genome Sciences (IGS) unveiled a \"one-stop shop\" for brain cell data called the Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive). This archive is now available to neuroscience researchers to transform their understanding of the complex workings of the brain. "}
