Delayed hypersensitivity to vaccines is not uncommon but also does not typically contraindicate further vaccination, and patch testing can be used to determine the cause, according to a study published in Allergy & Asthma Proceedings. Marcella R. Aquino, MD, an allergist and immunologist in the department of pediatrics at Hasbro Children's Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island, and colleagues examined published reviews and case reports in PubMed and data from the CDC. In one study, researchers reported [delayed large local injection-site reactions](https://www.healio.com/news/allergy-asthma/20210903/most-patients-with-allergic-reactions-to-first-covid19-vaccine-receive-second-dose-safely) to the Moderna SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in 0.8% of recipients after the first dose and 0.2% after the second dose, including erythema, induration and tenderness, typically resolving after 4 or 5 days. Also, the review cited a series of 12 patients who developed delayed local large reactions to the Moderna vaccine, with onset between 4 and 11 days and symptom resolution between 2 and 11 days with antihistamine and corticosteroid treatment. Another series of 16 patients with delayed cutaneous reactions to the Moderna mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine demonstrated similar findings, with 15 patients developing erythematous painful local reactions near the injection site. Reactions occurred a median of 7 days after injection and lasted a median of 5 days with corticosteroid, antihistamine and cold compress treatment. The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech SARS-CoV-2 vaccines include polyethylene glycols (PEG). Overall [reactions to PEG are rare](https://www.healio.com/news/allergy-asthma/20220106/patients-with-peg-allergies-may-tolerate-mrna-covid19-vaccines), the researchers wrote. But PEG products with higher molecular weights have been associated with anaphylaxis reactions, and products with lower molecular weights have been associated with delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions (DTHRs). The available SARS-CoV-2 vaccines include polysorbates as well, the researchers continued. These fatty acid esters of polyoxythylene sorbitan can potentially cross-react. And although researchers did not find delayed cutaneous reactions to polysorbate 80, it is structurally related to PEG with implications in nonimmunologic anaphylactoid reactions. Formaldehyde and thimerosal, used as preservatives in some vaccines, may cause allergic reactions. The researchers reported three vaccine reactions \u2014 one to hepatitis B vaccine and two to influenza vaccines \u2014 due to formaldehyde and one due to thimerosal, also from an influenza vaccine. Additional excipients aluminum, gelatin and antibiotics \u2014 the most common being neomycin, gentamycin and polymyxin B \u2014 have also been implicated in delayed vaccine reactions. Patients with histories of DTHR to vaccines may delay or skip other vaccinations, according to the researchers, who encouraged clinicians to conduct patch testing for those with histories of nodule formation or contact dermatitis. Patients with local reactions do not need evaluation, the researchers continued, but patch testing should be considered for those with delayed cutaneous reactions. Patch testing improves quality of life overall, the researchers added, because many vaccine components are contact allergens that patients encounter in daily life as well. Further, the researchers urged clinicians to engage in shared decision-making and discuss the potential for reactions after vaccination with patients who have histories of DTHRs as well as management strategies to ensure safe and satisfactory outcomes.
