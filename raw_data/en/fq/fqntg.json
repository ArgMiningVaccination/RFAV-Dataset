I continue to be inspired by Terps' dedication to discovering new knowledge and developing creative solutions to address the most pressing issues of our time. In particular, I was tremendously proud of how our research community came together to support the Grand Challenges Grants program\u2014the largest and most comprehensive initiative of its kind in the university's history. We committed $30 million in institutional funding to support 50 grant awardees, representing 185 faculty researchers across all 12 colleges and schools at UMD. You'll read about some of those grants in this issue of Enterprise, and about how these projects are reaching across disciplines and breaking down institutional barriers to accelerate solutions to complex problems like climate change, global health crises, educational disparities, racial and social injustice and many others. The numbing repetition of high-profile tragedies and everyday deaths helps to keep one of these grand challenges\u2014gun violence\u2014top of mind; in a gripping feature by Sala Levin '10 in this issue, you'll learn about innovative faculty efforts, including a new campus center, to stem this bloody tide. Another new feature story reveals how our researchers are unlocking new methods for preventing or mitigating climate change developed by looking to trees for scientific inspiration. I hope you enjoy this second annual issue of Enterprise, which also contains some of our most exciting and impactful research and funding news from the past year, as well as a collection of faculty honors and awards. I suspect that many of you will be as energized as I was to learn about the work of our world-class community of scientists and scholars propelling us all fearlessly forward. Go Terps! I Gregory F.

COVER Photo by John T. Consosli3 ENTERPRISE 2023 2 RESEARCH.UMD.EDU FrontiersInstitutional Grants ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE FOR A SUSTAINABLE EARTH Led by Ellen Williams , Distinguished University Professor of physics and director of the Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center, the initiative brings together leaders from departments around campus focused on Earth system science. This discipline encompasses all the connections of climate change\u2014from how the oceans store carbon to atmospheric reactions near the boundary of outer space to human impacts on ecosystems. The project is designed as a step toward the creation of a new school at UMD for translating Earth science and climate science research into action for the region, nation and world. \"We want to build a transdisciplinary col- laborative bigger than the sum of its parts so we can most effectively address challenges posed by climate change\u2014starting in the state of Maryland,\" including helping farmers with climate-related crop management and warning of extreme weather, says team member Professor Tatiana Loboda , chair of the Department of Geographical Sciences. GLOBAL FEW ture ALLIANCE: FOOD-ENERGY- WATER SOLUTIONS FOR A CHANGING CLIMATE Worldwide, 1.3 billion people are food-in- secure, 770 million lack adequate access to energy sources and 2 billion lack access to safe drinking water. Climate change magnifies these challenges, and commu-nities of color often bear the heaviest burdens. The Global FEWture Alliance, led by Amy Sapkota \u2014MPower Professor of environmental health in the School of Public Health and director of the CONSERVE Center of Excellence\u2014acknowledges that our vital resources are inextricably linked. \"Instead of addressing food, energy or water challenges individually, we must work across disciplines to develop holistic technology-based and policy solutions that focus on all three areas,\" working with partners in Israel, Nepal and Tanzania on experiential learning and capacity-building, Sapkota says. MARYLAND INITIATIVE FOR LITERACY AND EQUITY (MILE) The COVID-19 pandemic produced the greatest decrease in literacy scores in more than 30 years. But for adults and children living in marginalized communities, \"access to literacy achievement is not something that was 'lost'\u2014full literacy has always come with barriers,\" says Donald \"DJ\" Bolger , associate professor of human development and quantitative methodology, and leader of the initiative. The project aims to close opportunity gaps that have contributed to longstanding societal inequities even as they threaten to create new ones. A bedrock goal is to better connect literacy research to U.S. teacher preparation and professional development, sharing evidence-based practices with schools, communities and policymakers. Team members of MILE also intend to change how literacy studies are done to reap more relevant knowledge by greater focus on those\u2014multilingual learners, underserved communities of color\u2014who stand to benefit the most from the research, he says. PHOTOS VIA UNSPLASH Rising to the Challenges: UMD Awards $30M to Spur Solutions Unprecedented Program Funds Research on Climate, Racial Justice, Energy and More URGING TEMPERATURES and rising seas. Droughts, famines and poverty. Intractable social inequities. The world's toughest problems can prompt despair\u2014or propel people and institutions to redefine themselves, strive for solutions and rise to the grand challenges of our time. That outlook of hope, girded by a belief in the power of science and scholarship, is behind an unprecedented $30 million investment the University of Maryland made earlier this year in 50 research projects spanning every college and school and a host of disciplines. The university's Grand Challenges Grants program is led by three projects that will each receive $3 million Institutional Grants over three years to increase literacy, explore the nexus of food, water and energy systems, and protect Marylanders from the effects of climate change. \"Since day one of my presidency, I have charged our campus to tackle the grand challenges of our time by taking advantage of the brilliant work being done by our faculty and researchers across disciplines,\" says UMD President Darryll J. Pines. In addition, six Impact Award winners\u2014 other finalists in the institutional category\u2014 were each awarded up to $500,000 over two years; and 16 Team Project Grants and 25 Individual Project Grants winners will receive three-year totals of $1.5 million and $150,000, respectively. The UMD faculty energetically answered the call for proposals; about 135 poured in from across campus, says Vice President for Research Gregory F. Ball. \"In total, they cover a kaleidoscopic array of pressing topics and societal priorities, and we can't wait to see what our world-class researchers accomplish in the months and years ahead,\" he says. The full list of funded projects spans subjects as diverse as preparing for future pandemics, fighting racism, developing human-centered artificial intelligence, better understanding the processes of our body's microbial communities and strengthening democracy. Institutional Grants in particular, which require cross-disciplinary, multi- institutional work, have the potential to spark profound changes, said Senior Vice President and Provost Jennifer King Rice. \"This collaborative approach allows us to realize novel insights and never-before-ex - plored connections, which supports our overarching goal of creating meaningful solutions that advance the public good for our state and around the globe,\" she says.

PHOTOS VIA UNSPLASH7 ENTERPRISE 2023 6 RESEARCH.UMD.EDU Frontiers Vision and Impact UMD Researchers Played Key Roles in Two Spectacular Space Missions That Paid Off in 2022 ONE WAS A DRY RUN for an audacious method to protect the Earth by knocking an asteroid around like a cosmic cue ball. The other was the culmi - nation of decades of work to create the keenest instrument for exploring the universe ever launched into space. University of Maryland astronomers, engineers and other researchers were at the center of two space missions\u2014the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART)\u2014 that launched in late 2021 and returned eye-popping data in 2022.James Webb Space Telescope: NASA, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency rolled out the first full-color images from the JWST in July. It has since provided, among other things, the deepest view of the distant universe ever recorded, along with images and data for nebulae, galaxy clusters and distant planets, with much more to come. The telescope was built around the corner from the university at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and dozens of UMD faculty and alums have orbited the project throughout its development. They helped design, construct and test the long-awaited successor to the Hubble Space Telescope (still going strong with plenty of Terp support) and are closely involved in operations, mission planning and eventual translation of Webb telescope discoveries to the public. \"We've been waiting so long it feels almost surreal,\" says astronomy Associate Professor Eliza Kempton, who studies exoplanet atmospheres and was one of the first astronomers to use the new telescope. \"It's like a dream the astronomy community is waking up from, and suddenly it's here.\" Double Asteroid Redirection Test: Rather than explore, another mission with Terp leadership and several partic- ipants established our ability to turn aside asteroids that threaten Earth. In September, NASA sent a 1,300-pound \"impactor\" at 14,000 mph straight into the asteroid moon, Dimorphos, raising a dust cloud visible from Earth. The test's objective was to change, by 10 minutes, the moon's 11-hour, 55-minute orbit. Measurements a few weeks later showed it was altered by a whopping 32 minutes. \"We smacked Dimorphos really good,\" says Astronomy Professor Derek Richardson, an expert in the composition of \"rubble pile\" asteroids like the target, and the dynamics lead for the mission. \"I think DART has un- equivocally demonstrated we could\" protect our planet from a dangerous asteroid. \u2014CC ILLUSTRATIONS: TOP VIA ISTOCK, BOTTOM PHOTO VIA SHUTTERSTOCK PHOTO COURTESY OF NASANasal Battle New Protein-based Technology Fights Infection Where It's Most Needed GETTING THAT JAB\u2014 more accurately, a succession of them\u2014has been the main weapon against serious COVID-19 complications since late 2020, but if a University of Maryland researcher succeeds, most needles could give way to a few quick sniffs. Xiaoping Zhu, a professor of veterinary medicine, has developed an inhalable coronavirus vaccine that goes directly to work in the parts of the body\u2014like the nose and sinuses\u2014where even those with all their shots can be vulnerable. \"They're wonderful vaccines that protect people from hospitalization and death, but don't prevent transmission,\" Zhu says. \"The nasal vaccine produces an antibody that stays in the upper respiratory tract to stop transmission.\" In a White House summit last summer, Dr. Anthony Fauci, then-chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden and director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said nasal vaccines promise \"not only to protect against disease, but to protect against acquisition and by acquisition, transmission. And that's really the holy grail.\" Unlike inhaled COVID vaccines recently approved in China and India, Zhu's does not rely on live or attenuated virus\u2014making it safe for children and the immunocompromised\u2014and instead uses a patented, engineered protein based on the body's own mechanism for transporting substances like vaccines across cellular barriers. Zhu and colleagues were developing it to fight flu, but began adapting it to COVID even before a pandemic was declared. They've since conducted two rounds of animal trials, recording high effectiveness. Now, a company Zhu helped found, Transmucosis, is preparing for human clinical trials even as Zhu and colleagues work on an improved second-generation vaccine. It's time to follow our noses when deciding on vaccines, Zhu suggests. \"We regularly see news stories that COVID is bouncing back again,\" he says. \"I think this has to do with needing an approach that can stop transmission.\" \u2014CC Testing Test-Optional Admissions $1.4M Gates Foundation Award Supports Study of Effects on Equity A $1.4 MILLION GRANT from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, announced in February 2022, is supporting a University of Maryland-led study to assess the impact of a nationwide shift to make the SAT and ACT optional for college admissions, or to eliminate their use altogether. Associate Professor of Education Julie J. Park and colleagues are examining whether higher edu- cation institutions' swift moves to alter admissions processes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic improved college access or equity for different student populations. More than 1,800 accredited colleges and universities, including UMD, were using test-optional policies in admissions for Fall 2020, according to the nonprofit FairTest. The College Board reported that 1.7 million students in the high school Class of 2022 took the SAT, a drop from 2.2 million in 2020. The broad retreat from requiring stan- dardized exam scores came at a time of increasing scrutiny, with critics charging that this traditional gateway to college further stacks the deck against people from underrepresented racial or socioeconomic backgrounds, or with disabilities. \"Test-optional policies are becoming more common; however there needs to be more research and data to inform decision-making,\" says Park, who is collaborating with researchers at Colorado State University, Penn State University and Southern Methodist University. \"There also needs to be more research on how inequality affects other parts of the college application.\" 9 ENTERPRISE 2023 8 RESEARCH.UMD.EDU FrontiersMajor Federal Research Partnerships Several large cooperative agreements created or renewed collaborations with UMD in science and technology: RESEARCHING SUSTAINABILITY The Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center (ESSIC) announced a new five-year, $95 million cooperative agreement with NASA. Established in 1999, ESSIC is a joint center with NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center that supports research, teaching and career training in Earth system science. The funding allows UMD to expand collaborations with the space agency and the broader research community to better understand our planet's complex environment, and human interaction with it, to address challenges of sustainability. \u2014AR SAFEGUARDING OUR FOOD A five-year, $41 million cooperative agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will expand a University of Maryland-based institute's work to provide scientific information to fight food-related illness and enable the development of sound public health policy. Established in 1996, the Joint Institute for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition is an FDA Center of Excellence combining the expertise of the federal agency with UMD researchers. \u2014EM, MG STRENGTHENING AGRICULTURE NASA tapped researchers in the Department of Geographical Sciences to lead a five-year, $15 million consortium to turn satellite data into down-to-earth, actionable information to support agriculture in the United States. The consortium will expand upon the existing UMD-led global food security and agriculture program, NASA Harvest, with which it shares a common objective: to strengthen food security, agri - culture, and human and environmental resilience. \u2014RG PHOTO VIA SHUTTERSTOCKReport Lays Out Road Map to Halving U.S. Emissions Analysis Unveiled at UN Climate Conference Calls for Clean Vehicles, Green Energy IF \"BOTTOM-UP\" ACTION from states, cities and businesses combines with ongoing federal leadership, the United States can meet its 2030 climate target of reducing emissions 50-52% from 2005 levels, according to a UMD-led analysis. The report from its Center for Global Sustainability (CGS) and the \"America Is All In\" coalition was presented by its co-chair, businessman and former New York City mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, at the United Nations' Climate Change Conference in Egypt in November 2022. While the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 makes important climate strides toward the U.S. goal, \"getting the rest of the way there will require ambitious, creative and feasible actions from states, cities and businesses, with support from the federal government,\" says Alicia Zhao, CGS research manager and lead author of the report. The report found that imple- menting current policies would cut greenhouse emissions 39% below 2005 levels by 2030. To close the gap, the report recommends: A dopting sales targets and mandates for zero-emission vehicles; R etiring all existing coal plants; A recovery climate-smart agriculture; S etting \"buy clean\" industrial facility standards.NIH Grant Funds Study of Structural Racism, Pandemic Effects on Farmworkers Nationwide Research Focuses on Air Quality, State Policies and Legal Protections AFEW MONTHS AFTER COVID-19 struck the United States, public health Associate Professor Devon Payne-Sturges began hearing stories about migrant and seasonal farm workers on Maryland's Eastern Shore getting sick but still going to work\u2014a dangerous choice that didn't surprise her. During the pandemic, such workers were deemed \"essential\" and risked firing if they stayed home. \"Legally, farm workers are exempt from overtime pay,\" says Payne-Sturges, of the Maryland Institute for Applied Environmental Health. \"They don't have health care, and they don't have sick leave. These are policy decisions made on purpose that are creating vulnerabilities.\" The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in August 2022 awarded Payne-Sturges a $3.7 million grant to study structural racism and health among Black and Latinx migrant and seasonal farmworkers around the country. Data around these issues is lacking, she says. The grant will support her team's efforts\u2014with fieldwork starting this spring\u2014to better understand health disparities facing these crucial but marginalized workers who are often exposed to unsafe environments and toxic chemicals, yet rarely offered sick leave or health care. The project includes partners at the Francis King Carey School of Law at the University of Maryland, Baltimore; CATA: The Farmworkers Support Committee; and researchers from Washington University in St. Louis, American University and Indiana University Bloomington. The team will focus on environmental health, including air quality and infectious disease testing; system engagement with farm owners and managers as well as policymakers and farm worker advocates; and policy and legal analysis of actions to protect migrants' and seasonal workers' health. \u2014AE Can Sound and Touch Convey Big Data? NSF Project Would Expand Employment, Education Opportunities for Blind People FROM FUNCTIONING EFFECTIVELY at work to keeping up with the news, modern society increasingly demands data-savvy citizens. Charts and infographics that can help make a sea of numbers tangible often present a barrier for blind users, and existing digital accessibility tools like screen readers can't even provide summaries of such visual data, let alone allow detailed searches. Supported by $433,000 awarded by the National Science Foundation in August 2022, two University of Maryland researchers are turning to sound and touch to help people analyze large-scale data. \"The fundamental impact that this work will have on the millions of people in the United States and around the world who are blind or have low vision cannot be overstated,\" says Niklas Elmqvist, who is leading the two-year project with fellow College of Information Studies Professor Jonathan Lazar. The pandemic highlighted this urgent need, with one study showing that half of blind users rely on help from sighted people to access vital data about COVID-19. The UMD team are working with the blindness community and technology organizations to assess popular accessibility tools and contexts, conducting the research through the lens of two real-world settings that require large datasets\u2014higher educa - tion and employment. The underlying approach, called \"sensory substitution,\" uses assistive technology to functionally substitute one sense with another, says Lazar, director of UMD's Trace Research and Development Center, which works to improve accessibility in technology. For example, Lazar and UMD colleagues built iSonic, which creates an audio version of a map to allow a user to hear various pitches that georeference data. Elmqvist, with an appointment in the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, led the development of an essential oil diffuser that conveys data through smell, and is working with the Maryland Department of Education to create a computer science data course for blind high school students. \u2014MH 11 ENTERPRISE 2023 10 RESEARCH.UMD.EDU Frontiers PHOTO BY KEVIN ALLEN; ARTWORK BY CY KEENER AND JUSTINE HOLZMAN TOP PHOTO VIA STOCKSY; BOTTOM ILLUSTRATION BY VALERIE MORGANNew Nap-Time Theory Research Suggests Children's Need for Daytime Sleep Depends on Brain Development MANY PARENTS FIND themselves asking: Why do some young children nap like clockwork, while mine fights sleep like her 3-year-old life depends on it? Am I doing my little one harm by not forcing her to rest? According to new University of Maryland research, parents can worry less about age-determined nap schedules, because little ones' need for downtime depends more on their brain development. A paper published in October 2022 in a special sleep issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by Tracy Riggins, an associate professor in UMD's Department of Psychology, and Rebecca Spencer, a psychology professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, shows that children might stop taking naps when their brains become more efficient in downloading and consolidating what they're learning. Classmates who haven't taken that neurological step yet may require daytime sleep. \"If you think of the hippocampus (the part of the brain largely responsible for learning and memory) as a bucket, you know how much pressure there is for a child to sleep based on how full their bucket is,\" Riggins says. \"When the brain matures, it can either hold more, empty itself more quickly, or both; and that's when a child may begin to transition out of napping.\" The researchers' hypothesis was born out of previous research findings from Riggins, an expert on child brain development and memory, and Spencer, an expert on cognition and sleep. In an earlier study likewise supported by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, they found that more sleep for children ages 4 to 8 made for better recall of facts. \u2014RG Data, Ice and Art Professor's Arctic-Focused Creations Capture Endangered Beauty IMAGES OF MASSIVE chunks of ice collapsing from Greenland's glaciers are emblematic of a changing climate and the need to drastically cut global carbon emissions. Assistant Professor of Art Cy Keener is working to characterize some of these icebergs\u2014capturing their unique identities and the ways they change as they drift in the sea. His collaborative \"Iceberg Portraiture\" series (above) was part of an exhibition that opened in September 2022 at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C. Keener created it with landscape researcher Justine Holzman, climatologist Ignatius Rigor and scientist John Woods after almost four years of trips to the Arctic to place trackers onto the ice to collect data with the hopes of making that information tangible and visceral. The resulting 7-foot-tall digital ink-and- pastel portraits provided a glimpse into the life of four icebergs with vastly different scales and shapes\u2014some the size of a car and others a third of a mile wide\u2014observed and recorded in August 2021 in western Greenland. \"Each of these [icebergs] is a piece of 10,000- to 40,000-year-old ice coming off the Greenland ice sheet into the ocean,\" Keener says. \"In this exhibition we understand them as living things, falling apart in front of your eyes, constantly changing. We show their diversity and beauty.\" Another work at the exhibition, the nearly 8-foot-tall \"Sea Ice Daily Drawings,\" was made of aluminum, acrylic, paper and ink and based on some 27,000 data points from sensors buried meters into the ice. Keener (right) received a $200,000 grant from the National Science Foundation in 2020 to produce the exhibition. Among his other ice-focused works have been \"Sea Ice 71.348778\u00ba N, 156.690918\u00ba W,\" an installation he and Holzman created at VisArts Gallery in Rockville, Md., that used hanging strips of 6-foot-long, blue-green polyester film to reflect the thickness and color of Arctic ice based on buoy data. He also created various versions of \"Digital Ice Core,\" a sculpture that used electronics, data and satellite communication to link a remote field site with a light sculpture composed of 1,000 LEDs. Viewers could see a recreated version of the ambient light in the air, ice and ocean in close to real time. \"I'm using data not to get more statistics, but to make these things that are on their way out physically real\u2014to extend the experience through time and tell a longer story,\" Keener says. \u2014JW Crab Shell-Based Battery Gets Cracking for Sustainability Engineers' Biodegradable Electrolyte Could Shrink EV Pollution Burden ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE a major part of the equation for protecting Earth's climate, but not everything adds up yet: The batteries powering these rolling sustainability solutions aren't always sustainable themselves. But now University of Maryland scientists have created a zinc battery with a biodegradable electrolyte from an unexpected source: crab shells. The discovery was presented in a paper in September 2022 in the journal Matter. \"Vast quantities of batteries are being produced and consumed, raising the possibility of environmental problems,\" says lead author and materials science and engineering Professor Liangbing Hu, director of the University of Maryland's Center for Materials Innovation. The study's other authors are affiliated with the University of Houston and UMD's Department of Materials Science and Engineering. For example, he says, polypropylene and polycarbonate components of lithium-ion batteries will take hundreds or thousands of years to degrade, while electrolytes in batteries are frequently flammable or corrosive. The new battery, however, uses a nonflammable gel electrolyte made from a biological material called chitosan, the most abundant of which is the exoskeletons of crustaceans like crab, shrimp and lobster. A biodegradable electrolyte means that about two-thirds of the battery could be broken down by microbes, with the chitosan electrolyte decomposed completely within five months. This leaves behind the metal component, in this case zinc, rather than more-toxic lead or lithium. The zinc and chitosan battery has an energy efficiency of 99.7% after 1,000 battery cycles, making it a viable option for storing energy generated by wind and sun for transfer to power grids, Hu says. 13 ENTERPRISE 2023 12 RESEARCH.UMD.EDU Frontiers TOP PHOTO BY JOHN T.

Leading the project at UMD are Christopher Jarzynski, a Distinguished University Professor with appointments in chemistry and biochemistry and in physics, and Nicole Yunger Halpern, a fellow in the Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science (QuICS) and a scientist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. \"We look forward to building a North American lodestone for quantum thermodynamics, inspired by our international peers,\" says Yunger Halpern. The scientists involved in the Maryland Quantum- Thermodynamics Hub say they're interested in not only a richer understanding of quantum physics and its use in technology, but also how it connects to the flow of time and the laws of classical physics we constantly see playing out in everyday life. In addition to cutting-edge research in the new field, the hub team also plans to organize symposia, seminars and even a science- fiction short-story contest. \u2014BKB UMD Center to Help State Department Stay Abreast of Quantum Technologies UMD'S QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY Center (QTC) will provide technical guidance on the latest developments in the rapidly expanding world of quantum research and development to the U.S. State Department to help protect U.S. national security, the department announced in December 2022.The research center, which is dedicated to translating the complexity of quantum science into revolutionary technologies and applications, will supply the department with technical information while facilitating dis - cussions with other government and industry partners. The department plays a key role in protecting American strategic interests and closely monitors potentially revolutionary emerging technologies. \"I'm thrilled to work with the Department of State to aid their understanding of quantum technology and how it can address some of the toughest challenges society is facing today\u2014and prepare for the challenges of tomorrow,\" says QTC Director Ronald Walsworth, a UMD professor of electrical and computer engineering and physics.Women Managers Go to Bat for Subordinates Men Tend to Compete Harder Only When Advocating for Other Men, Study Shows WHILE RESEARCH SHOWS that men generally come to work with a more competitive mind- set than women, female managers equally step up when advocating for direct reports, University of Maryland research found. Led by Associate Professor Cristian Dezs\u00f6, the study also showed that male managers compete harder when advocating for male subordinates, according to research published recently in Strategic Management Journal. Dezs\u00f6, in the Department of Logistics, Business and Public Policy, co-authored the research with Nathan Barrymore Ph.D. '22 and Ben King Ph.D. '21, a postdoctoral research associate. In a series of experiments in a simulated organizational setting, they found that when rewards to subordinates accrue, female managers become more competitive whether they're advocating for a man or a woman. \"These results suggest that female manag- ers are effective sponsors: They are willing to go to bat for their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s at levels similar to those of their male colleagues,\" Dezs\u00f6 says. Although male managers' competitiveness generally remained static, they became more competitive for male prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, based on a mistaken belief that men have higher risk tolerances and are willing to take on higher-stakes assignments. \u2014KJ $1.5M FTA Grant Bolsters Work on Equity in Mass Transit UMD-Led Coalition to Plan for More Affordable Housing, Pedestrian and Bike Access A $1.5 MILLION Federal Transit Administration grant announced in November 2022 is funding a University of Maryland-led plan for equitable and sustainable transit-oriented development along a 16-mile light-rail route that will link the northern Washington, D.C., suburbs. The two-year project by UMD's Purple Line Corridor Coalition prioritizes initiatives from researchers, policymakers and advo- cates to add affordable housing, preserve small businesses and improve access for walkers and cyclists in neighborhoods at risk for gentrification and displacement along the Purple Line. Scheduled for completion in 2027, it will have 21 stops, including five on or near the UMD campus. \"This grant will enable us to dive deep on critical challenges in equitable development that have emerged over the last two years, while putting social justice and community engagement at the forefront,\" says Sheila Somashekhar, director of the Purple Line Corridor Coalition, which is administered out of UMD's National Center for Smart Growth. The project scope includes planning to convert strip malls along the corridor to ensure the survival of businesses, many of which are in low-income or immigrant neighborhoods. The project will also help create an affordable housing pipeline\u2014new construction, rehabilitated housing and a plan for generating capital and funding sources. The project team will further identify locations for bike and pedestrian infrastructure to connect neighborhoods to the corridor. Grant funds, says National Center for Smart Growth Director Gerrit Knaap, will additionally support coursework for UMD students and faculty that promotes social and climate justice, equity and the unique identities of corridor neighborhoods. Awarded to the Maryland Transit Administration and administered by the coalition, the grant is the second-largest of 19 distributed in 2022 through the federal agency's Pilot Program for Transit-Oriented Development Planning program, and follows a $2 million FTA grant in 2018. \u2014MTH Deep Dive15 ENTERPRISE 2023 14 RESEARCH.UMD.EDU PHOTOS BY JOHN T. CONSOLI AND STEPHANIE S. CORDLEORE THAN 150 years ago, Maryland launched its \"Oyster Navy\" to fight off illegal harvesting by rapacious pirates who'd stripped the shellfish from the waters of their own states and were now plundering the bounty of the Chesapeake. Despite the seagoing police force's efforts\u2014sometimes backed by rifles and cannons\u2014centuries of overhar- vesting, mismanagement and devastating diseases squandered those natural riches. Maryland's yearly oyster harvests plummeted from 19th-century highs of 15 million bushels to just 26,000 in 2003. The 540,000 bushels taken in the 2021-22 season\u2014the most in 35 years\u2014is still less than 4% of the 19th century record. Today, led by an A. James Clark School of Engineering professor, a multi-institu- tional team of researchers is developing a modern-day analog to the Oyster Navy, fighting to restore oyster populations not with gunboats, but with underwater robots. The project funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the National Science Foundation seeks to infuse the Maryland shellfish industry with technologies that have revolutionized land-based agriculture. So-called \"precision farming\" often uses robotic aerial drones mounted with sensors to scan fields for factors like topography and soil content, giving farmers data to plan seeding or harvesting schedules, or apply fertilizers in exact amounts where needed. Overall project leader Miao Yu, a mechanical engineering professor whose specialty is robotic sensing, says Maryland's archaic oyster trade needs modern methods to augment its traditions. \"The shellfish industry in the Chesapeake Bay is mostly using the same technology from 200 years ago, with most things done very laboriously by hand,\" she says. \"It has not evolved, not adapted like terrestrial farming.\" Decisions as basic as where to plant oyster larvae and steer a boat to find fully grown ones are still based on intuition and experience, rather than objective data. On a June 2022 data-gathering trip on the Choptank River, a major Chesapeake tributary, Yu's doctoral student, Keshav Rajasekaran, struggled in an open boat against glaring sun and murky water to control a pair of microwave oven-size aquatic drones fitted with optical and acoustic sensors. Working with Alan Williams, a master's student studying with fisheries scientist and project co-leader Matthew Gray of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, Rajasekaran hunched over his laptop directing the robots to gather visual and sonar imagery of oysters. \"The idea is: The sonar can see the oysters through the turbid water from a distance although with low resolution, while the camera has high resolution, but can only see the oysters close up\u2014so we plan to use both,\" he says. With all that and a type of artificial intelligence known as machine learning, Yu and collaborators at UMD and beyond are teaching computer systems to recognize sonar signatures of marketable oysters. One day, a robot\u2014even a swarm of them\u2014could zoom through an area and quickly provide an oyster farmer with a map showing a host of metrics, including where oysters are ready to harvest, where they're immature, and empty zones. Beyond oyster visibility, the project could lead to a range of revolutionary practices, Yu says: underwater robots planting tiny oysters affixed to shells, or \"spat,\" in perfect spots, or harvesting with delicate precision that takes only viable shellfish and leaves growing ones and the bay bottom undisturbed. \"People think we're dreaming if we mention all that,\" Yu admits. Another aspect of the project, led by bioengineering Professor Yang Tao, is examining how to plot perfect dredging paths to avoid immature oysters while using as little fuel as possible. Other collab - orators hail from the UMD Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Louisiana State University, Pacific Shellfish Institute, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Georgia Tech and the Fraunhofer Center for Experimental Software Engineering. Together, their technologies could be applied to other types of seafood, from mussels to crabs. Don Webster, a University of Maryland Extension principal agent focused on aquaculture and one of the co-leaders of the project, says advanced aquaculture technologies could reshape the industry and make oysters once again a staple in the American diet. \"As I tell my growers, 'I want to see Wendy's, Popeye's and Burger King arguing over who's got the best oyster sandwich,'\" he says. \u2014CCThe Modern Battle for Maryland's Oysters Researchers Use AI and Robotics to Save a Treasured Chesapeake Bay Species and Revive a Struggling Industry Seafood company owner Casey Todd (above, steering boat) prepares to dump oyster shells near Crisfield, Md., to help young oysters grow.

The institute will leverage advances in artificial intelligence and computing to create a premier learning health care system that evaluates de-identified and secure digitized medical health data to diagnose, prevent and treat diseases in patients across the state. It is the latest initiative from MPower, which brings together the complementary strengths of the two universities to boost Maryland's innovation economy, advance interdisciplinary research, create opportunities for students and solve important problems. \"Scaling up research to address grand challenges in the life sciences has shifted from collecting data to using cutting-edge technology to discover meaningful patterns hidden in the data,\" says Darryll J. Pines, UMCP president. The institute is expected to open in leased space in 2023, with completion of laboratory and office space at the North Bethesda Metro location in 2028.

Virtual reality landscapes matched with classical opera to transport people with painful injuries outside of themselves and reduce the need for pain medication. These medical examples of extended reality (XR)\u2014the umbrella term used for technology based in virtual and augmented reality or other immersive media\u2014are already being prototyped or tested in clinical trials. But technical challenges and sparse regulatory guidelines hamper their widespread use in health care settings. Now, with $5 million from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and technology titans including Google, Microsoft and Meta (formerly known as Facebook), the University of Maryland is leading a multi-institutional effort to develop, test and certify XR technologies in medicine and health care. Behrooz Shirazi, acting deputy division director of the NSF's Division of Computer and Network Systems, calls the new Center for Medical Innovations in Extended Reality (MIXR) one of the first national centers at the intersection of medical and computing sciences. \"We expect this vibrant collabo - ration to produce significant societal and health care impacts,\" he says. MIXR will work with regulatory experts at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, ensuring that safe, effective and innovative clinical solutions make it to patients as soon as possible. \"We'll work closely with our industry and government partners to answer any scientific questions regarding regulatory evaluations and decisions needed for the wide-scale clinical use of these devices,\" says Amitabh Varshney, computer science professor and dean of UMCP's College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences. He is the lead-site principal investigator on the project, and is joined by partner-site PIs Sarah Murthi, M.D. (left), an associate professor of surgery at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, and Mark Cohen, M.D., a professor and vice chair of surgery at the University of Michigan Medical School. Varshney and Murthi co-direct the Maryland Blended Reality Center, launched in 2017 as part of MPowering the State, the strategic partnership between the University of Maryland, College Park and the University of Maryland, Baltimore. Early projects out of the center prototyped new diagnostic tools to assist physicians at the renowned R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore, where Murthi is director of the critical care ultrasound program. MIXR is heavily dependent on powerful computing resources. At Maryland, those resources will be handled by the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies. Between industry partners, scientists, physicians and federal regulators, Varshney says, \"the synergy in MIXR will be contagious.\" \u2014TV *SOURCE: NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION HIGHER EDUCATION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SURVEYFY21 University of Maryland (College Park and Baltimore campuses) research expenditures$1.14 BILLIONRank among U.S. public research universities (17th overall) 10 th Increase over UMCP's and UMB's FY 2011 totals 26 %Combined Research Strength 19 ENTERPRISE 2023 18 RESEARCH.UMD.EDU Since trees first arose nearly 400 million years ago to dominate our planet's landscapes, they've exemplified what Swiss-German poet and novelist Hermann Hesse called \"the ancient law of life.\" Growing in size, diversity and complexity as they evolved, trees spread across continents in forests that supported teeming ecosystems; they helped form Earth's hospitable atmo- sphere as they took in carbon dioxide and exhaled oxygen; they witnessed the reign of the dinosaurs and the later rise of mammals while providing food and shelter for myriad species, including us. Trees that died and were subject to millions of years of geologic forces were important in the formation of hydrocar - bons like coal and crude oil. Humanity in recent centuries learned to exploit this \"fossil energy\" in earnest, building industrial societies, speedily traversing the globe and creating technology and wealth that previous generations couldn't have imagined. Today, as the bill for relentless, nearly uncontrolled pollution comes due\u2014in rising global temperature, surging sea levels, the spread of new diseases and the struggle of whole ecosystems to endure\u2014many tree species face threats from global warming. In research on the benefits of urban forests, on trees as vehicles to pull carbon permanently out of the atmo- sphere and on trees as sources of truly green energy, University of Maryland researchers are leveraging these ancient symbols of solidity and permanence to fight climate change and mitigate its effects.From Urban Forest Canopies to Underground Carbon Vaults, UMD Researchers Are Creatively Fighting Climate Change BY CHRIS CARROLL PORTRAITS BY JOHN T. CONSOLIHarvesting Hope From the Trees Uprooting Racism in Urban Forests A DRIVE THAT WINDS south through Baltimore\u2014from the north end of leafy Roland Park through the hipster haven of Hampden and finally into the underserved neighborhoods surrounding downtown\u2014displays more than just a pan- orama of declining socioeconomic status, but one of urban ecological decline. From the 1930s until the passage of the 1968 Fair Housing Act, these close-in areas were \"redlined,\" or declared hazardous for investment, in a nationwide real estate assessment by the federal Home Owners Loan Corporation. The scheme cut off access to affordable financing and trapped many residents, often from racial or religious minority communities, in a cycle of urban decline that continues a half-century later.A study of Baltimore street trees, published in Ecology in fall 2022 and led by entomology Assistant Professor Karin Burghardt, showed that large trees were nine times less likely to be growing in formerly redlined areas than elsewhere in the city, while the diversity of trees was far lower. The problem extends beyond aesthetics. \"The shade that trees provide, and the cooling effect that occurs when trees take up water and release it into the atmosphere\u2014both of those fight the 'urban heat island' effect,\" where heavily built-up areas absorb more heat during the day and retain more at night than surrounding environs, she says. \"A healthy tree canopy makes the neighbor - hood a healthier place to live.\" While Baltimore overall has a diverse portfolio of tree species, past reforesta- tion programs in redlined areas focused too much on a few species like red maple. It's a wonderful tree, Burghardt says, but one that could be wiped out locally by an insect infestation or other environmental issue and leave neighborhoods bare again. The study she conducted with partners at the U.S. Forest Service, Johns Hopkins University and University of Maryland, Baltimore County can help guide Baltimore in future reforestation efforts, she says. And with support from UMD's Grand Challenges Grants program (see pages 2-5), Burghardt will continue research to find tree species best able to survive an uncertain climate future. \"We don't know a lot about what's going to happen to all these species in the temperatures that are coming down the pike in urban areas,\" she says. \"That's another reason to spread risk over a diverse community of street trees.\"21 ENTERPRISE 2023\"Poplar\" Alternative to Boost Biofuels, Free Up Farm Fields for Food HERE'S AN ENTICING proposition for fighting climate change: Instead of unearthing long-buried carbon and pumping it into the atmosphere as fossil fuels, society can power itself with plant fuels composed of carbon pulled from the atmosphere, a CO 2 recycling process that's potentially carbon-neutral. But real-world biofuels, like ethanol mixed with gasoline or biodiesel, have a drawback: The \"biomass\" that's fermented to make them, often corn or soybeans, is grown on productive agricultural land, pushing up crop prices and increasing food insecurity for hundreds of millions of people. With support from a $2.6 million Department of Energy grant in fall 2022, Gary Coleman, a UMD associate professor of plant sciences and landscape architecture, is working with the poplar tree genome to enhance poplars' ability to grow on \"marginal land\"\u2014a source of biomass that could allow traditional farm fields to return to food production. \"These are lands with reduced water availability or reduced nutrient availability,\" he says. \"They're not ideal places to grow anything, so the question is, what can you do to maximize biomass production there?\" Coleman and his team are applying genomic technology\u2014like CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing\u2014to the genes that control the metabolism of poplars to maximize their ability to acquire nitrogen and other essential nutrients from the soil, and how they use it to grow. Leaves, for example, are green in the summer, and in the fall they turn yellow and other colors: That's the tree pulling those nutrients back out of the leaves to store them for the winter before the leaves drop, Coleman said. \"But when a leaf falls, it still takes important nutrients from the tree with it\u2014so can we engineer that process to be more efficient and enhance growth?\" If he and his team can find a way, trees could play an even larger role in preserving a global environment they've helped shape. A Proper Burial to Clear the Air THE GNARLED CHUNK of wood that atmospheric and oceanic sci- ence Professor Ning Zeng dug up on a research trip and now keeps in his home lab may point the way to healing Earth's climate. \"It stayed there a few feet underground for hundreds or thousands of years, very well preserved,\" he says. \"Because of the conditions of the soil, it never decomposed, and the carbon in the wood stayed there.\" Trees have always captured and stored carbon dioxide in wood, even as R&D is ramping up globally to develop mechanical \"direct air capture\" of greenhouse gases. Many carbon offset programs, in which institutions or individuals make investments in fighting climate change to compensate for emissions they cause, are based on planting various tree species. A problem, Zeng says, is that once those farmed trees die\u2014or when a wild forest is bulldozed for grazing land or when a tree behind your back fence crashes to the ground and rots\u2014the stored carbon filters back into the atmosphere through decomposition or burning. Properly burying trees could vastly extend the time they're able to sequester carbon, from decades to millennia. For nearly 15 years, Zeng has worked on what started as back-of-the- napkin calculations about how to alter the Earth's climate trajectory by sinking dead wood in clay-rich soil that keeps out oxygen and prevents its breakdown. He's pursued the idea with his students, and last year launched a startup company, Carbon Lockdown, to begin moving toward a worldwide system of regional wood dumps that take dead trees from municipalities and homeowners, demolition waste and trees harvested from carbon offset projects. After an earlier project in Quebec showed his technique prevented decomposition for years, he's scoping out a larger test site in the Baltimore- Washington area to open the first such collection point this year. While scaling up wood dumps globally would be neither simple nor the project of a single team or company, a built-out system as he envisions it could absorb 10 gigatons of carbon a year, or more than 25% of humanity's output. \"We could strongly alter the trajectory of climate change without any new technology or other changes in society,\" Zeng says.ILLUSTRATION/PHOTO CREDIT23 ENTERPRISE 2023 22 RESEARCH.UMD.EDU ILLUSTRATION/PHOTO CREDITto 2023 22End ONE EVENING IN FEBRUARY 2021, Janaria Muhammad stepped out of her house in Knoxville, Tenn., to meet friends at her favorite restaurant, Kings and Wings.

Knoxville, a hilly city of roughly 190,000, outstrips most other U.S. cities of its size in rising violence. In 2022, the city's homicide rate was 21.4 per 100,000, more than double in 2018 and roughly triple 2022's national rate. While U.S. cities saw a 30% increase in homicides from 2019 to 2020, Knoxville's surged 68%. In 2022, Kincannon, in conjunction with the Knoxville Police Department, hired Abt (then chair of the Violent Crime Working Group at the think tank Counsel on Criminal Justice) and other experts to analyze gun violence in the city, deter- mining who and what was fueling it and recommending policies to reduce it. This data-centric approach appealed to Kincannon, who aimed for a plan not based on emotion or rhetoric\u2014the sort of thing that makes news for a day or two and then disappears. \"I didn't want to just do a headline. I wanted lasting change.\" Abt and the team examined the 82 homicides and 188 nonfatal shootings in Knoxville from 2019 through 2021. The trio found that, in a city that is 75% white, a large majority of victims and perpetrators were Black men aged 18 to 34, and at least 59% of shootings involved members of gangs (or groups, as Abt calls them). At least 63% of shooters and victims had had previous contact with the criminal justice system. \"The single most reliable indicator about whether someone's going to be involved in violence or whether violence is going to happen in a certain place is whether it's happened in the past,\" Abt says. He bases his approach on three principles: focus, balance and fairness. First, he says, law enforcement and city services should be concentrated where crime occurs most and the narrow subset of people responsible for the worst offenses. They're who criminologist Lawrence Sherman, a UMD distinguished university professor, calls \"the power few.\" Taken too far, this risks the problems New York City had with \"stop and frisk\" policing, in which 90% of those stopped by the NYPD from 2003 to 2021 were people of color. Baltimore experienced what critics say were similar excesses during former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley's mayoral tenure, when he approved widespread arrests for minor offenses like loitering. Abt says law enforcement can avoid discriminatory overpolicing in part by working with community members to determine who in the neighborhood poses a true threat. \"You go to these neighborhoods, and people will tell you who is doing what\u2014 but only if they trust you,\" says Abt. That's far different, he says, from an approach that treats every person of color or inhabitant of certain neighborhoods like a suspect. Abt's second tenet is balance, or \"the notion that balancing prevention and punishment works far better than either approach in isolation.\" Street outreach workers who locate suspected members of the power few might try to connect them with therapy, get them involved in commu- nity programs or direct them to housing or job assistance. \"You need to target services and support to some of the supposedly least sympathetic people,\" says Abt. Finally, fairness\u2014or legitimacy\u2014is the linchpin in assuring that these inter- ventions work according to plan. The impact of laws must be \"felt equally across social groups,\" Abt writes; they must be enforced \"according to widely accepted values, including transparency, impartiality, proportionality and equality.\" These concepts and conclusions from the data led Abt and his team to make a number of recommendations to the city in fall 2022. A few months later, the city is \"under construction with a new way of policing,\" Knoxville Deputy Police Chief Tony Willis says. \"What we want is our officers to get a call, and it's no longer 12 Cherry St. It's the Smith house.\" BORN AND RAISED in Cambridge, Mass., Abt was exposed early to the idea of using data to address social problems by his father, Clark Abt, an MIT-trained researcher whose social science think tank, Abt Associates, takes on issues like public health, education and economic mobility. Abt's interest in violence reduction was fueled by his own close-to-home shock. In 1999, while attending Georgetown University Law Center, he taught a class at a local high school. One student \"sat in the back, was extremely disconnected, often To mark the second anniversary of Nana's murder, dozens gathered outside the squat brick building that houses East Knoxville's YWCA Phyllis Wheatley Center, where she regularly came after school to do homework, play basketball and snap pictures with friends. Friends and relatives, along with community members and leaders, clutched purple balloons\u2014the color she'd chosen for her bedroom\u2014under a gray, oatmeal-textured sky. Her parents spoke to news cameras, pleading again for help finding her still-un- identified killer. \"If we don't get justice in this life, we know that we will get justice in the next,\" said Jacquelinne Muhammad, Nana's mother. Confronted with 40 other homicides that year and desperate to lead her city to a safer future, Knoxville Mayor Indya Kincannon picked up a book that promised a straightforward approach to reducing gun crime: \"Bleeding Out: The Devastating Consequences of Urban Violence\u2014And a Bold New Plan for Peace.\" In it, author Thomas Abt, a University of Maryland associate research professor, delivers a set of evidence-based action items: focus a range of prevention efforts on those likeliest to be perpetrators or victims; keep a closer eye on areas likeliest to experience violence; and employ people who know the world of street violence intimately to act as mediators. As Kincannon read the book, she was struck by the feeling that \"it was written for mayors,\" she says. \"It's research-based, but it's also very, very practical.\" She emailed Abt to ask him more about his ideas, laying the groundwork for what's becoming a central part of the city's anti- violence strategy. Knoxville is the first city to partner with Abt's Center for the Study and Practice of Violence Reduction, or VRC. Formed shortly after his arrival at UMD's Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice, the center, funded partly by the private philanthropy organization Arnold Ventures, seeks to conduct research on minimizing gun violence, and to offer its expertise for free to municipalities around the country. Partnerships with other cities, including Boston, are in the works. \"The mission is very simple,\" says Abt. \"We want to save lives by stopping violence, using science. As we measure our progress, that will be the question: Have we saved lives?\" KNOXVILLE POLICE OFFICER Conner Wiesen- berg has the kind of \"how's your dad doing\" familiarity with neighborhood regulars that Abt prizes, because it opens doors for peaceful solutions to problems that could escalate to bullets flying. He graduated from Knoxville Central High, and played on its basketball team with kids from Lonsdale, a neighborhood that experienced violence then, too. \"It would not be uncommon for us to be on a traffic stop and somebody rolls by, calls my name out, it's somebody that I know,\" he says. On foot patrol one bone-chilling February evening in Lonsdale Homes, a subsidized housing community, Wiesenberg and his partner, Andrell Cummings, point out a small square of pavement where someone has spray-painted a design, including the word \"Pache,\" the nickname of a neighborhood resident accidentally shot and killed last May during a dispute he'd been trying to defuse. Knoxville and cities around America are increasingly littered with symbols of tragedy. In 2020, amid a pandemic, political toxicity and civic upheaval, the U.S. reached a startling new peak: 79% of murders involved a gun, the highest since at least 1968, according to the Pew Research Center. Other numbers also painted an unsettling picture: In 2021, the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive recorded the most gun deaths, 45,107, since its 2013 founding. While suicides and domestic violence make up a significant number of gun deaths, Abt's focus is urban or community violence, defined in \"Bleeding Out\" as occurring \"outside the home, on the streets or in other public spaces where people congregate.\" Muggings gone too far, gang rivalries, personal disputes that play out in parking lots or on street corners\u2014those are Knoxville police officers Andrell Cummings (left) and Conner Wiesenberg look at a memorial to a resident killed last year.

We want to save lives by stopping violence, using science.\" \u2014Thomas Abt University of Maryland associate research professor 27 ENTERPRISE 2023 26 RESEARCH.UMD.EDU slept through major portions of class,\" he recalls. Gradually, as Abt worked to engage him, he became more responsive. One of Abt's mentees from the program later asked if he'd heard about the guy in the back of the class: He'd been murdered. Years later, as he began writing \"Bleeding Out,\" Abt searched unsuccessfully for details. \"I contacted the homeroom teacher. He was like, 'Thomas, I can't tell you how many students I've lost. There's just no way I could possibly pick this one out among all the others.'\" Abt went on to examine this problem of violence from the perspective of a teacher, a prosecutor, a government official and an academic. After law school, he worked as an assistant district attorney in New York County, followed by time at a law firm and as voter program director for the 2008 Obama presidential campaign. Post-election, Abt joined the Department of Justice as chief of staff to Assistant Attorney General Laurie O. Robinson, who prioritized \"bringing sound science and reliable data into the criminal justice decision-making process,\" he says. Robinson calls Abt \"somebody who can cross those lines and bring important knowledge from research into the world of hard decisions on the practical side.\" He would demonstrate that as New York's deputy secretary for public safety, where he initiated the Gun Involved Violence Elimination (GIVE) program, and later in a five-year fellowship at Harvard, when he wrote \"Bleeding Out.\" Critics like Jeffrey Butts, director of the Research and Evaluation Center at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, say Abt's philosophy takes a fast-action approach to problems with deep roots, poten- tially neglecting \"people who talk about fundamental causes and long-term solutions,\" he told The Atlantic in 2019. Abt agrees systemic approaches like reducing poverty, improving education and creating job oppor- tunities are all essential, but says that unlike preventing shoot - ings\u2014\"as a matter of practical reality, those things are not achievable in the near future.\" Two things primarily separate the VRC from other centers focused on gun violence: its all-hands approach, which incor- porates a spectrum of ideas on enforcement and prevention; and its work with elected leaders and grassroots activists at no cost to implement new methods and ideas. Abt is \"uniquely qualified to help lead this effort and also to coordinate other initiatives at the university that are centered around violence research,\" says Rod K. Brunson, interim chair of the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice and senior policy adviser to the VRC. He is \"one of the thought leaders in this space.\" DOWN SECLUDED Adcock Avenue in Knoxville, Wiesenberg points out a low-slung house where he used to drop off basketball buddies after school. In April 2020, Anthony Sanford, one of them, was killed here, shot in the back in what appeared to start as a drug deal. Later that night, Wiesenberg, an officer on the Community Engagement Response Team (CERT), got a call saying that neighbors and witnesses were stonewalling investigators, but that \"there are some people up here that are name-dropping you.\" Wiesenberg went to the house alone and gleaned information that eventually led to the arrest of a suspect. That kind of relationship is essential to CERT, a unit that focuses exclusively on violent crimes with the kind of community- first policing Abt encourages. Each night, CERT officers walk through neighborhoods, asking residents how things are going. An anonymous tip line also lets citizens text officers. Denzel Grant represents another branch of the violence reduction ecosystem. As leader of the violence interrupter program Turn Up Knox, Grant works with kids at risk and adults who have actually committed violent offenses, offering programming, mentorship and resources for help finding a job or place to live. Grant saw violence at an early age. In 1998, his cousin, Andre Stenson, was pulled over for driving without headlights. On parole and driving without a license, he ran from police, who wrestled him to the ground and handcuffed him. He died on the way to the hospital, after saying that he couldn't breathe. (A federal jury later ruled in favor of the officers in a lawsuit.) \"I always had the passion for (community work) ever since,\" says Grant, who was in elementary school at the time. \"I've just been doing it ever since.\" Grant has made unexpected connections. \"We have become pretty good friends,\" says Deputy Police Chief Willis, \"and I would not have bet one dime on that occurring.\" But Grant has become \"a powerful partner\" in helping police de-escalate potentially volatile situations. Knoxville native LaKenya Middlebrook is responsible for ensuring these disparate elements cohere. In 2021, the mayor appointed Middlebrook director of community safety, a role in which she links citizens, law enforcement, civilian oversight committees and school districts to implement Abt's recommendations. Gun violence is \"an issue that is so front- of-mind and so deeply personal for so many folks in our community that people want to help,\" says Middlebrook. \"They want to be a part, they want to figure out what role they can play, they are really open to thinking about how we can do things a little differently.\" Much of Turn Up Knox's youth programming takes place at the YWCA. At the ceremony commemorating Nana Muhammad's death, Grant, Middlebrook and others held their balloons as Nana's father, Lawrence, talked about his daughter. \"She's that tree where all the seeds fall off and other plants grow,\" he said. Afterward, those gathered released their balloons and watched them soar, far beyond where any tree could snag them. TERP UMD Researchers Lead 120 Initiave on Gun Violence Reduction Other University of Maryland researchers are tackling the problem of gun violence with a variety of approaches. Joseph Richardson Jr., the Joel and Kim Feller Professor of African American Studies and Anthropology, and Rod K. Brunson, interim criminology and criminal justice chair and professor, are groundbreakers in the field of violence reduction. Their work is part of the 120 Initiative to Reduce Gun Violence\u2014 a D.C.-area coalition of higher education institutions founded by UMD President Darryll J. Pines and George Mason University President Gregory Washington to focus research expertise at the problem. (Its name honors the number of people who die on average daily from shootings in the U.S.) Richardson pioneered an inter - vention strategy that begins as soon as gunshot victims are wheeled into the emergency room. He talks with patients in their hospital beds, learning their stories and beginning the process of connecting them with resources like legal aid or mental health counseling. Brunson's work focuses primarily on the relationship between law enforcement and the community. His most recent study examined how place-based factors influence the decisions law enforcement officers make.What we want is our officers to get a call, and it's no longer 12 Cherry St. It's the Smith house.\" \u2014Tony Willis Knoxville Deputy Police Chief Denzel Grant leads Turn Up Knox, a program to keep kids and adults from violence. Such organizations are critical to violence reduction, says Abt.29 ENTERPRISE 2023 28 RESEARCH.UMD.EDU Groundbreakers ILLUSTRATED PORTRAITS BY VALERIE MORGANELIZABETH APARICIO , assistant professor of behavioral and commu- nity health, received the ECPN John B.

IOP PUBLISHING LTD. PSYCHOLOGY AND THE SOCIAL CLASS WORLDVIEW: A NARRATIVE-BASED INTRODUCTION Anne E. Noonan , professor of psychology, and William PHOTO BY JOHN T. CONSOLI No Appetite for Racist Stereotypes Professor's Book Chews Over the Consequences of Food Shaming FOR BLACK AMERICANS, the simple act of eating can be fraught. Gathering for a barbecue in a public park can lead to run-ins with the police. Dining on traditional dishes, developed through ingenuity and necessity out of generations of slavery and poverty, can lead to racist ridicule. In her 2022 book, \"Eating While Black: Food Shaming and Race in America,\" American studies Professor Psyche A. Williams-Forson breaks down how unfair scrutiny of what Black Americans eat keeps society from addressing systemic inequities. \u2014KS Why did you want to write this book? Shaming Black people for what and where they eat is not new. It began during enslavement; the ways farms and plantations were set up were about surveilling Black bodies. And it's moved straight into the contemporary moment. People feel they've been given permission to overcorrect Black people's lives, from music to clothing to language to food, because these things go against the grain of whiteness and \"correctness.\" We all need to eat, so it's easy to dismiss the unseen power dynamics around food. But if we are going to have conversations about people's freedoms, we need to talk about food. What's an example of how Black Americans are food-shamed? My book opens with the D.C. Metro worker who was eating on the train in uniform, when a woman took her picture and blasted it on social media. The employee was literally going from one part of her job to the next, trying to fit in a meal. She knew Metro was no longer issuing fines for eating so she did so. Then she has her life exposed. What are some food misconceptions that you address? People like to criticize fast-food restaurants, but they are major gathering hubs for the elderly and other people who are alone. Farmers markets aren't utopias. If you don't set up in Black neighborhoods, offer food that's culturally relevant and accept Black vendors, people won't feel welcome. Also, dollar stores can be important sources of food. If you're on a fixed income, and you can go in and buy 20 items with $20, that can make a difference in people's lives. How can the conversation about Black food culture be harmful? We hear a lot about Black people and their diets, and how they're unhealthy and obese because of soul food\u2014but you can't blame ill health squarely on food. Look at \"the stroke belt,\" which stretches across the South. These are states with repressive policies and laws. There's a lot of wage inequality, people who are unhoused, people who are unemployed. Society wants food to do the heavy lifting because it takes our focus away from systemic inequalities that keep people mired in oppression, which contributes to psychological and physical disease.Faculty Q+A PSYCHE A.
