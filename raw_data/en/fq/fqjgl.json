When she released her film, DPT: Vaccine Roulette, the world of public health was forever altered (Offit, 2011). Especially back in the 1980's, there was always a certain trust amongst doctors and patients. Parents would routinely bring their children in for the very important DTP vaccination without any second-guessing occurring. This vaccination, as with many other vaccinations, was crucial for protecting children from deadly infectious diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (Offit, 2011). However, when Thompsons' documentary surfaced, many parents soon went into a frenzy worrying if they made a mistake by vaccinating The link between childhood vaccinations and autism is unfounded and can be proven by a plethora of research. MMR vs Autism: A False Choice, written by Alison Knopf, sets out to show the importance of vaccinating children. Not only does the article explain the importance, but it also debunks the myth of the link to autism. Knopf explains, how measles can be a deadly disease. As less parents are vaccinating their children, they can no longer rely on \"herd immunity\". The lack of vaccinations can be linked to a direct fear of autism. However, with the In the United States of America, childhood immunizations have prevented an estimated twenty-one million hospitalizations and seven-hundred and twenty thousand lives among children born in the last twenty years (CDC). In recent discussions of childhood immunization, a controversial issue has been whether the amount and composition of these vaccines being administered intravenously, to enhance the body's immunity, are in fact safe for the human body at such a vulnerable stage in its systematic development. Consequently, this has brought about a belief among a division of people who believe that their child shouldn't be vaccinated. Anti-vaxxers commonly believe vaccinations can cause autism spectrum disorder, contain harmful ingredients that constitute Being a part of a family that believes in vaccination, I also grew to believe it. Now that I am old enough to understand what it is and can find more reasons as to why we should have it. It made more a believer, that all children should be vaccinated. Children deserve to be safe and healthy. We are all entitled to our opinions, but there are many facts out there that can tell us reasons why vaccines are good for us. I think getting vaccinated would help many people in so many ways. I heard many arguments about vaccines and most of them are positive arguments. If I were to become a parent, I would definitely have my kid get vaccinated because I want my kid to be healthy and free from any illnesses that could come. This is my reason and belief of why people should get vaccinated. Mandatory vaccinations for children in public schools have been the center of much debate since laws were first developed to regulate immunization. Fears from parents about side effects and adverse reactions have steered many away from wanting to vaccinate their children despite the numerous infectious diseases they prevent. These debates have gotten in the way of progression in schools for preventing the spread of disease. To me, the risks of not vaccinating children are far greater than the risks of adverse reactions. Parents who don't vaccinate their children put them and others at risk because it allows normally preventable disease to continue to spread. In the science sector, there are many arguments whether science is beneficial for humans or is it a curse upon us, this debate is also applicable to child vaccination. Child vaccination is a sensitive health topic that parents and doctors argue about, were some say that vaccination can be harmful for their children, others say that it might prevent their children from getting sick. What is Child vaccination? Child vaccination is the process of injecting dead bacteria or viruses in our body for our immune system to recognise as a pathogen^1 and fight that particular pathogen. Also the pathogen is being recognised by our body for the future, so our body can defeat this particular pathogen faster in the future and a person won't get the disease. Vaccination Nation is about the controversy of vaccinations causing autism. The United States federal court denied any link between autism and vaccines, more specifically the MMR vaccine. Vaccines causing autism has been the talk on news, celebrities and magazines. Despite scientist denying that there is no connection this topic has gained several legal claims against vaccines. This has led parents into panic about autism. The medical cost for an autistic child is about $100,000. Today one in every 150 kids are diagnosed with autism which is a great increase from 20 years ago which was only one in 10,000 kids. This whole controversy began in 1998 when a British gastroenterologist named Andrew Wakefield examined 12 children, nine of them To vaccinate or not to vaccinate? That is the question. Vaccination has sparked heated debate since its development amongst the following groups; parents, naturopaths, medical professionals, etc. Fuel has been added to the fire of the vaccine debate by the media and anti-vaxxer fear mongering tactics, making it hard for those considering vaccination, to decipher fact from myth. It is vital that we first understand the facts rather than believing the latest rumor before making an informed decision to vaccinate or not. This is the aim of this report. Through analytical research presented in this report I have come to the conclusion that vaccines are not only crucial and beneficial but that everyone who is eligible should be vaccinated, as that Many parents want what's best for their children, especially when it comes to their child's health. One of the most controversial topics today is whether or not to give children the required vaccinations. By choosing to vaccinate a child you could potentially determine the future for that child and diseases they could and could not be exposed to. The real question is, Why should you vaccinate? It is important for parents to know all of the facts before they make the decision to vaccinate. Did you know that 5.1-6% of the state of Michigan is not vaccinated. There are many people including medical professionals that believe the benefits that vaccines give to the children far outweigh the risks that could occur from not giving the vaccines. Since our founding, our country has struggled to find a compromise between security and liberty. A balance between the two is exceedingly difficult because we are a fickle species and we change our minds on which we want more. A current controversy that has spiked national security interest is the topic of vaccinations. The United States is on the edge of a public health crisis. For many years, all 50 states have required that parents vaccinate their children against various diseases, including polio and measles, before enrolling them in public schools, and exempted parents who claimed to have religious or philosophical reasons (Ciolli). As we continue to grow as a society we become more knowledgeable and opinionated on many topics including According to CDC, or Center of Disease Control, vaccines have reduced and, in some cases, eliminated many diseases that killed or severely disabled people just a few generations ago. Being vaccinated is very important and very effective. Children should have to be vaccinated, especially when it could cause such a huge impact on others if they do not. The cost of the vaccines are just a small price to pay for the prevention of future illnesses and diseases. It should be a moral and legal obligation to vaccinate all children. A young mother and father look in on their small frail daughter lying listlessly in her bed. Feverish, sweaty, and lethargic, she peaks up at her parents pleading for the pain to go away. Her glands are swollen and her body is hot, her beautiful skin welted in red. The note from school warned of an outbreak of rubella measles. Their young daughter became a victim of a non-discriminating virus that attacks with no mercy. As they sooth her whimpers they question their decision not to vaccinate their child. They had discussed it so many times, whether to vaccinate or not, what about the rumors of autism? They had been lucky and avoided rubella as a child, perhaps it spare their child too. Now, they are not so sure they made Many people may think that vaccination is a bad thing, that instead of preventing it causes illness, that is not natural. Natural or not, there are many reasons as to why we should vaccinate us and the younger generation. Most of the time children don't like vaccination because it hurt, but is the responsibility of a parent to seek the wellbeing of his or her child. Vaccination it's a preventive measure of various diseases. Unfortunately, things like the anti-vaccination movement, the misinformation on the Internet, and the believe that vaccination causes more damage than is worth, have led our society to think that it's right not to vaccinate. Modern medicine provides people with the ability to protect themselves from the world's most fatal diseases. Merely a century ago, it was not uncommon for a child to die as a result of diseases such as polio, pertussis, and tuberculosis. Today, it is highly unlikely for a person to contract these diseases, let alone die from them. However, refusal of vaccinations has been increasing throughout the years due to the anti-vaccination movement. This movement declares mandatory vaccines unconstitutional and vaccinations overall as the cause of autism. Unfortunately, the anti-vaccination movement is becoming increasingly popular due to individuals' unfounded fears and imagined consequences associated with the idea of purposely inserting a disease into one's body. However, despite one's beliefs, vaccines are essential not only to a person's well-being, but to the health of those around them. Mandatory vaccinations do not cause autism; rather, they save lives while upholding values of popular protest, or that focus on sought changes in civil society rather than in politics or the "}
