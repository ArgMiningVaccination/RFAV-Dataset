That's not surprising since kids can \"catch\" five to ten colds per year, especially during the fall and winter months. ( [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2722603/)) But are common ailments such as the [common cold and flu](https://fullscript.com/blog/the-cold-vs-the-flu) inevitable when kids go back to school? With proper prevention, you may be able to reduce their risk of illness. Common childhood illnesses According to the American Academy of Family Physicians, the following are among the most common viral or bacterial illnesses experienced by school-aged children: - Colds - Ear infections - Gastroenteritis (stomach flu) - Influenza (flu) - Strep throat ( [4](https://familydoctor.org/common-school-age-illnessesinfections/)) Did you know? The common cold can be caused by one of 200 different viruses. Most, however, are caused by a member of the rhinovirus family. ( [20]) Back to school checklist to avoid sickness Helping families maintain their defenses as kids head back to school often requires a few easy-to-implement strategies. Here are three of the top preventative habits, backed by science. Wash your hands frequently Lathering up regularly is one of the simplest ways to prevent sharing pathogens. Most upper respiratory viruses are spread by direct contact, and something as simple as sneezing into your hand then touching a doorknob, desk, or phone could spread the pathogen. ( [11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3249958/)) Eat well Eating a [balanced diet](https://www.flipsnack.com/fullscript/healthy-diet-foundations.html) will provide the nutrients a healthy immune system needs to function optimally and defend the body against pathogens. Protein from foods including lean meat, seafood, poultry, and soy products supports the strength and recovery of the immune system, and essential nutrients support its function. ( [12](https://www.npt.gov.uk/media/13280/3-pdf-boosting-your-immune-system.pdf?v=20200409092434)) Get enough sleep [Not getting enough sleep](https://fullscript.com/blog/sleep-related-to-health-and-wellness) can suppress the immune system and increase the odds of contracting the common cold or flu. People who are sleep deprived develop fewer antibodies and are more prone to chronic [inflammation](https://fullscript.com/blog/inflammation). ( [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3256323/)) The amount of sleep you need depends on your age. For example, the National Sleep Foundation notes that a preschooler needs ten to 13 hours of sleep per night, while a school-aged child needs nine to 11 hours. Adults, on the other hand, should strive for seven to nine hours every night. ( [17](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/excessive-sleepiness/support/how-much-sleep-do-we-really-need)) Did you know? Kids who get enough sleep aren't just healthier. According to research in the journal PLoS One, they are more motivated, tend to pay more attention in class, and perform better academically. ( [9]) 5 supplements to keep families healthy Prevention can go a long way toward keeping kids and parents healthy during the back-to-school season. Supplementing with one or more of the following herbs and nutrients can support immunity. If a child (or parent) does come down with something, certain supplements can also ease symptoms and often shorten the duration of the illness. Andrographis (Andrographis paniculata) Among this medicinal herb's active compounds, andrographolide is a plant chemical with anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and immune-boosting properties. Studies show that andrographis is an effective supplement for reducing the symptoms of uncomplicated upper respiratory infections. ( [14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20092985%5Buid%5D)) Better yet, research in the journal Phytomedicine found that andrographis reduced the risk of illness from a winter cold by 33% among a group of students. ( [21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17887935)) Echinacea This well-known [medicinal herb](https://fullscript.com/blog/botanical-herbs) has the ability to turn on the body's innate and adaptive immune responses. Echinacea can also stimulate the production of antibodies that modulate the immune system's response to bacteria, viruses, fungi, and [allergens](https://fullscript.com/blog/manage-seasonal-allergies-naturally). ( [21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17887935)) When you're sick, echinacea may enhance your non-specific immune response and increase the number of immune cells\u2014especially white blood cells, monocytes, neutrophils, and natural killer [15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11505787)) Elderberry (Sambucus nigra) Black elderberry has been used for centuries to address flu symptoms, as well as the common cold. Research shows that [elderberry extract](https://fullscript.com/blog/elderberry) may possess antimicrobial benefits against both the gram-positive bacteria that causes strep throat and the gram-negative bacteria responsible for ear infections, sinusitis, and pneumonia. ( [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21352539)) More recently, a randomized double-blind trial of airline passengers reported that those taking elderberry had fewer colds and among those who did become sick, the elderberry group had shorter, less severe colds than those taking a placebo. ( [18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27023596)) When sick, taking elderberry in combination with antioxidant nutrients, such as vitamin C and zinc, can help support the natural process of recuperation. ( [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21352539)) Probiotics Since about 70% of the body's total number of immune cells reside in the gut, taking probiotics can help protect against cold and flu viruses. ( [19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2515351/)) One clinical trial found that taking a probiotic containing Bifidobacterium bifidum reduced the frequency of colds among a group of college students. ( [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25604727)) Another study involving preschoolers found that giving them a daily multi-strain [probiotic](https://fullscript.com/blog/benefits-of-probiotics) reduced the incidence of colds and flu by as much as 31.8% and reduced the duration of the illness if they did get sick. ( [8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19651563)) Zinc [Zinc](https://fullscript.com/blog/zinc-benefits) plays a key role in immunity and the body's ability to combat infections. Studies involving school-going children have found that those taking a proactive dose of zinc were less likely to come down with a cold. ( [13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3273967/)) This important mineral can also shorten the duration of a cold if taken at the onset of symptoms, and pairing it with vitamin C might enhance zinc's immune-boosting properties, especially in children. ( [16](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23775705/))( [10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20515554)) The bottom line Practicing healthy habits and supplementing with medicinal herbs and nutrients can enhance immunity before and after getting sick. Taking steps now to protect against these common back-to-school illnesses can help keep your entire family healthy all season long.
