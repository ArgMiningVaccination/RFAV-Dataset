Or you may feel like your surroundings are in motion when they aren't. Many people describe vertigo as feeling dizzy, but it's different from being light-headed. Simple movements are unusually intense for people with vertigo, and the condition can impact your everyday life. Your symptoms will probably depend on what's causing your episodes and the type of vertigo you have. Types of Vertigo The two main types of vertigo are: - Peripheral Vertigo [Peripheral vertigo](/neurology/vertigo-how-will-your-doctor-make-diagnosis/)is caused by a problem in areas of the inner ear or the vestibular nerve, which connects the inner ear and the brain. This is the most common type of vertigo. - Central Vertigo Central vertigo happens when there's a glitch in the brain, particularly in an area of the brain called the cerebellum, or brainstem. RSV-HSN: A New Type of Vertigo? Participants sat in a dark room while an examiner moved their heads forward and then side to side for about 15 seconds. Next, researchers made a video recording of the participants' eye motions. Results showed those with RSV-HSN had eye movements, known as \"nystagmus,\" that lasted longer than in others with vertigo. The scientists say that, compared with other types of vertigo, RSV-HSN involves more severe bouts of motion sickness. In the study, people with RSV-HSN had attacks that included nausea, vomiting, headaches, and intolerance of head motions. They experienced symptoms anywhere from a few times a week to once a year. At this point, the cause of RSV-HSN isn't known, but the condition does seem to respond well to medication. Common Questions & Answers Signs and Symptoms of Vertigo Symptoms of vertigo vary from person to person. Your symptoms might be mild or severe, depending on what's causing the issue. - Dizziness - Feeling like you're moving or spinning - Problems focusing the eyes - Hearing loss in one ear - Balance problems [Ringing in the ears](/tinnitus/) - Sweating - Nausea or vomiting Central vertigo may cause signs and symptoms such as: - Double vision - Difficulty swallowing - Facial paralysis - Eye movement difficulties - Slurred speech - Weak limbs What Does It Feel Like to Have Vertigo? Many people describe vertigo as feeling like the room is spinning. It might cause you to feel like you're tilted, rocking, unbalanced, or unsteady. Sometimes these unpleasant sensations are worse if you're standing up, walking, or moving your head around. Many people describe these feelings as physically exhausting and taxing. Sometimes, the sensations are so severe that you feel nauseated or experience vomiting. Usually symptoms of vertigo don't include light-headedness, fainting, or motion sickness. Causes and Risk Factors of Vertigo Vertigo isn't a disease itself. Instead, it's a symptom of other conditions. Finding out what's causing your symptoms is one of the first measures your doctor will take in assessing how to cure vertigo. You'll need to know what's triggering your dizziness before you can treat it. Identifying specific risk factors and medical conditions can be helpful. An array of issues can cause vertigo. Some of the most common are BPPV, M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, and [labyrinthitis](/labyrinthitis/guide/). Less common causes include [migraines](/migraine/guide/), medication, head injuries, and stroke. Vertigo: Problems With the Inner Ear Symptoms of vertigo are often the result of an inner ear (vestibular system) problem. Your inner ear plays a big role in helping you feel balanced. Inside your ear is a tiny organ called the vestibular labyrinth, which includes semicircular canals that contain fluid and hair-like sensors. Other structures in the ear, called otolith organs, help monitor the movement and position of your head in relation to gravity. Otolith organs contain small crystals that make you responsive to gravity. Sometimes, these crystals can break free and move into the semicircular canals. This can irritate the hair cells within the canals and make them more sensitive to head position changes. It can allow for false messages about your body's position to be sent to your brain. Basically, inner ear disorders cause your brain to obtain signals from the inner ear that don't match up with what your eyes and sensory nerves (nerves that send messages to your brain) receive.

But for other people, it's chronic. Living with vertigo can be frustrating. Your episodes may be unpredictable and sporadic. Some days, you may not experience any symptoms, while other days, you might have debilitating bouts of dizziness. The good news is there are effective treatment options and most of the time, these treatments can help you control or eliminate your symptoms, so you can enjoy everyday activities. Duration of Vertigo Treatment and Medication Options for Vertigo Several treatment options are available to help symptoms of vertigo. Other types of physical therapy are used to relieve vertigo caused by inner ear problems. Sometimes medicines, injections, psychotherapy, or surgery are needed.

But knowing and avoiding certain risk factors may help prevent it. For instance, you can protect yourself from a head injury by wearing a helmet when bicycling or playing sports or taking measures to prevent a fall. Complications of Vertigo Typically, people with persistent vertigo are advised not to drive or operate machinery because these activities can pose dangers to themselves and others. Research and Statistics: Who Has Vertigo? Vertigo is typically more prevalent in older people, but it can affect anyone at any age. Women are slightly more likely to experience vertigo symptoms than men. Black and Asian Americans and Vertigo Vertigo can affect people of all colors and ethnicities, but some research has shown minorities may have a higher risk for certain types of dizziness. One study, published in 2016, found that Black Americans were more likely to have BPPV compared with white Americans. The authors of the study say this may be because diabetes rates are higher in Black Americans.
