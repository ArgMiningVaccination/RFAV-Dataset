I've had low Vitamin D for a while now and bought this to see if it'll help. Can't say too much about it just yet since I just got it but the 3 stars are for the taste. It taste very good to me! And I've also noticed that I'm not as tired as I usually be after I took it. Will come back later with an update on my vitamin D. Since taking this product, I've noticed a lot more energy and overall better mood. The flavor is good, easy to take, and worth the money! I cannot get enough Mary Ruth's products, and I love how natural they are and it's it's about time a company cared enough to put a good product out there. Has a great taste.
