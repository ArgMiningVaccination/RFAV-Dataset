This scent arrived and I can smell it though the bottle / plastic bubble wrapper. It reminds me of Vicks Vapo Rub. It has that therapeutic smell / aroma with it. I'm very pleased and you will be too. Eucalyptus is my favorite oil to use. Im a young living member but this brand of eucalyptus is just as good. Great quality Eucalyptus is one of my favorite oils. This worked just as I'd hoped in my diffuser for a nice relaxing smell. Eucalyptus is one of my favorite scents for my diffuser and this brand definitely doesn't disappoint! I've tried a few of their things now "}
