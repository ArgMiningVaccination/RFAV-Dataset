What happens during drug detox? Drug detoxification at RCA has two major components: monitoring, addressing and stabilizing the potential health implications of drug discontinuation; and managing the discomfort of physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms. The exact characteristics of withdrawal symptoms depend on many factors, including: - Type of drug - Amount taken - Period of use - Route of administration (smoking, injecting, snorting, etc.) - Medical history and mental health conditions Our expert clinical and medical staff will assess the various factors involved in your particular situation to create a detox plan to suit your needs. Your detox plan will include medications, as well as therapy and psychological support to minimize the withdrawal symptoms and ensure a safe, comfortable detox process. Don't wait to get the help you or a loved one urgently need What to expect during drug detox treatment Here is what you can expect with RCA's drug detox services. We take every measure to assure you are safe You will undergo a screening that covers everything from medical history and extent of substance use, psychiatric problems, family issues, and a medical exam to determine the seriousness of withdrawal or other possible medical emergencies. To protect all of our patients and staff, we also inspect your belongings to make sure that no one is bringing in any of their own medications, drugs or other contraband. You will also be instructed in the guidelines and treatment procedures, allowing for informed consent to treatment. Once admitted, recovery support specialists check in on you every 30 minutes to ensure your mental and physical well-being.

In addition to immersion in 12-Step programs, like Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous, you will be treated along a variety of clinical modalities, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, motivational therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy and narrative therapy, along with education about relapse and life skills including successfully reintegrating into the world without substance use. Medication used in drug detox There are two types of medications (primary, for safety, and secondary for comfort) that can be administered during detox. Primary, or direct, medications manage detox symptoms specifically, and typically include Suboxone, Methadone or Vivitrol. For secondary or comfort medications, you will be assessed every one to four hours to alleviate both physical and emotional pain. Comfort medications for physical suffering need not end with detox but can go longer, as needed. We will do everything to make sure you are comfortable Your safety and comfort are our priority, so we spare no step to ensure you make it through the early period of withdrawal with minimal discomfort.
