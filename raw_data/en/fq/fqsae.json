The surgeon uses a length of vein from a leg to make one or more grafts to bypass the blockages in the coronary artery and so restore the blood flow to normal. Cost Containment: Activities designed to hold down the cost of health care. Cost containment activities include coverage for expanded benefits (like outpatient surgery, preadmission testing, and different levels of hospital care), thorough review of claims, development of the continually evolving forms of health care (like HMOs and PPOs), and emphasis on health education and health promotion.

Sometimes a discharge is referred to as \"signing out\". Discount: A deduction from a specified sum that a provider has charged for health care services.

Such situations should be coded as '10' (No bill sent: Public clinic/health center or private charity).

Gross Pathology: Gross pathology is the study of tissues removed from living patients during surgery to help diagnose a disease and determine a treatment plan. Often, the surgical pathologist provides immediate consultation to the surgeon during surgery to help determine the best surgical process. For example, when performing breast cancer surgery, a surgical pathologist's examination of tissues removed during surgery can help determine whether to remove lymph nodes under the arm as well. Gross pathology includes both the physical examination of the tissue with the naked eye, as well as examining processed tissue under a microscope. Group Practice: An organized group of physicians working together in a central location.

HIPAA created national standards for ensuring the privacy of health care records. It establishes guidelines for medical providers, pharmacies, and health insurers to follow in handling health care information that identifies individual patients. One important section of the new law requires medical providers to obtain a signed authorization form from a patient before releasing information about that patient to a third party who is not involved in providing health care. The law also creates new requirements for the information that must appear on the authorization form. Health Maintenance Organization (HMO): An organized system of health care which assures the delivery of an agreed-upon set of health maintenance and health treatment services to a voluntarily enrolled group of persons. With an HMO, a person must generally receive care from HMO physicians; otherwise the expense is not covered unless the HMO referred the person or there was a medical emergency. With an HMO, the cost of a visit is typically covered in full or you have to pay a small amount (co-pay). HMOs have a variety of organizational structures that involve the relationship between the HMO and its physicians. These include: - Staff Model - The HMO physicians are salaried employees of the HMO and practice in the HMO's facilities. Some Staff Model HMOs have a fee schedule with the kind of charges that would apply to any patient they treated who was not an HMO member. Thus, on the Medical Event Form, you will usually be able to obtain \"the full established charge\" but not the amount and source of payment or the reason for the difference between charges and payments, as those items do not apply to HMO members. - Group Model - The HMO contracts with a separately incorporated medical group to provide service to the HMO's members. - Network Model - A variation of the group model in which the HMO contracts with several medical groups. - IPA Model - The HMO contracts with individual physicians or small groups of physicians to provide services to members.
