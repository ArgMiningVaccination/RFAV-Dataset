Doctor's came for patients along with proper diagnosis and treatment. Special thanks to Dr. P.N Singh sir. He is very polite and supportive. He is very caring about his patient. Nurses did really good job and quick on responses and queries. All services are good. Very cost effective. Staff and doctors are well mannered. We came directly to the admission office with my wife having severe stomachache. The promptness admission staff showed in allocating us ward was exceptional and the doctor too was very good.
