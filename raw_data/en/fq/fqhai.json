Yoga is a great addition to an athlete's training.

It's true. Football players, particularly, can often be found in a ballet studio on the regular. Why? Because ballet is a rigorous, no impact exercise that lengthens, strengthens, tones, and helps athletes with balance, spacial awareness, and injury prevention. Sound familiar? It should! Yoga improves all of those areas and more! What athletes aren't getting from ballet class that they would get from yoga is stress reduction, pain relief, and a mindfulness practice. Professional athletes really benefit from having appropriate ways to manage the stresses of their job. They are under immense pressure to perform well at every game and to constantly be pushing themselves to better their abilities. Here at My Yoga Teacher, we want everyone to feel comfortable pursuing their dreams, even if that means pushing your body to extremes. If you haven't checked us out yet, you definitely should!

And we have some thoughts on how yoga benefits athletes! It's no secret that athletes have sore muscles. When they're not participating in their sport, they're training for it. Athletes use (and overuse) their muscles. While nutrition plays a huge role in muscle recovery, restorative yoga does too. Together, nutrition and restorative yoga help athletes with tight, sore, aching muscles find relief without the use of over-the-counter or prescription medications, something that is often abused by athletes. Yoga also works quickly to help muscles recover. One yoga session can provide instant relief. Restorative yoga optimizes recovery by: It's not uncommon for athletes to get sick. They're around a lot of people and often performing in extreme weather conditions. Yoga is one way to help keep athletes well and restore their bodies so they can keep doing what they do best! Which leads us to... Many athletes work the same muscles every day, or almost every day. This means that \"smaller,\" supporting muscles don't get the same amount of strengthening, toning, and stretching as the major muscles an athlete uses to perform their sport. The main reasons athletes incur injuries are due to: A regular yoga practice means athletes work all their muscles, evenly. Even slower paced yoga, like yin yoga or Hatha yoga, stretches muscles that don't consistently get stretched. In sports like tennis, baseball, and golf, particularly, yoga brings more balanced training. Any sport that uses only one or two major muscle groups means the athlete is more prone to injury in other areas of the body. Consistently practicing yoga is an excellent way to prevent injuries in all athletes. Part of an athlete's job is training. Every day. When working out is a primary part of your job, it can create stress instead of relieving it. Because athletes are already under a lot of stress when they compete, stress due to training and the general pressures of being an athlete (especially a professional athlete) causes the release of cortisol. Chronically high levels of cortisol cause the muscles in the body to break down, deteriorate, and decrease immune function. All of which can cause injuries and illness. Not to mention all the other ways elevated cortisol levels are bad for your body. Learning deep breathing and meditation techniques are almost always a part of a regular yoga practice. Athletes benefit from yoga being a part of their athletic training in more ways than just physical. The mental and emotional stress of being an athlete affects their focus, as well as their professional and private lives. A regular yoga practice is scientifically proven to reduce stress, decrease anxiety and depression, improve mental focus, release feel good chemicals, and help yogis be more present in their lives. Athletes need yoga to perform their jobs better. Have you ever worked out late at night? Or even early evening? Working out releases endorphins, amongst other feel good chemicals, which perk you up. Sometimes that energy is short lived, but sometimes it's not. And that can interrupt or even prevent a good night's sleep. Athletes often struggle with irregular sleeping patterns. Professional athletes often perform later in the day or evening and then take part in after game parties or public relations events. Yoga literally trains the body to relax. Studies show that long-time practitioners of yoga experience better sleep quality and sleep patterns. It increases melatonin production, the chemical that helps you fall asleep, and helps calm the central nervous system through mindfulness and breathing exercises. Three types of yoga best for sleep? If you've never tried these forms of yoga before, My Yoga Teacher offers all three at various different times of day! Not to mention, our classes are live and virtual so you get the real time attention of an expert yoga instructor from the comfort of your home (or whatever space you're comfortable in)! It may seem obvious that athletes such as football players, boxers, wrestlers, gymnasts, and dancers regularly work their core muscles. For them (and other types of athletes), core muscles are imperative to their performance. However, that doesn't mean those athletes are training their core in a comprehensive way. It could be they're doing the same core exercises every day or working certain ones more than others. And there are lots of different kinds of athletes who probably don't focus on their core, like golfers, bowlers, basketball players, softball/baseball players, and skiers to name a few. This doesn't mean they don't need their core. This just means core strength isn't a focus in order to perform their sport. Strong core muscles are really important for any kind of movement. They prevent back and other skeletal injuries and help stabilize muscles and joints. Most types of yoga include a well-rounded strengthening and stretching of all the core muscles. Athletes benefit from yoga in many ways, but core strength is probably one of the most important because it prevents injuries! And that's something worth talking about.
