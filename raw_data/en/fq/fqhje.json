Below are some holistic ways to treat your eye allergies this spring. A tablespoon of apple cider vinegar can help reduce mucus production and cleanse your lymphatic system. If you're tough, you can swallow the vinegar as it is, undiluted; but for a more palatable option, try adding a tablespoon of vinegar and a bit of honey to a cup of hot water. Allergies occur when your body registers a substance like pollen or cat hair as a threat, like a virus. Symptoms like a runny nose and watery eyes are your body's attempt to flush the foreign substance from your system. You can help your body learn that local grasses and pollen aren't deadly by ingesting small doses of it, sort of like a natural vaccine. Since bees produce honey from what's around you, local honey likely contains trace amounts of the pollen that's affecting you. Yes, working out is probably the last thing you want to do when you feel crummy. However, it really can help: [researchers have found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23156847) that moderate to intense activity for just 30 minutes can result in substantial allergy relief. This is most likely because exercise produces an anti-inflammatory effect in your nasal passages, helping to naturally relieve allergy symptoms. If you decide to go this route, be sure to workout indoors so as to reduce your pollen exposure. In some cases, allergy symptoms are a result of having an imbalanced immune system. This can cause you to have a more severe reaction to foreign stimuli like pollen, dust, and grass. Probiotics give your immune system a boost by introducing beneficial bacteria into your digestive tract. A good source of probiotics can be found in fermented foods like kimchi and kombucha. Nettle leaf can help naturally block your body's ability to produce histamine, which will reduce itching and swelling. While you may be able to find nettle leaf grown locally, it's usually easier to buy it in capsules or [by the leaf](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=nettle+leaf&ref=nb_sb_noss). Steep it with peppermint leaves and a small amount of honey to create an herbal tea that will be as tasty as it is beneficial. Itchy, runny, watery eyes may also be a sign of an infection or other eye issue. If you are concerned about the health of your eyes, be sure to visit our Raleigh optometry office today.
