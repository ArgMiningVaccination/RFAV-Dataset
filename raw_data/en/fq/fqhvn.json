This is very rare information, which was very difficult to dig up (it took years of living, pondering, reading, and meditating in a cabin in the woods), so I do hope it supports you. The physical and emotional work we do on ourselves is fundamental, but I've found that for the deepest healing to occur, the body needs to be detoxified and rebuilt, through diet. I often work somatically with clients around physical and emotional trauma, both of which leave an acidic ash in the body. Couple that with primarily acid- forming diets over a lifetime, and it can all manifest as various 'diseases.' For healing, it is critical to flush that acid out of the system so that the tissues can regenerate with thriving, alkaline tissue, and so that the fluids that make up a majority of the body can be replaced with living water (water derived from living sources, such as springs, fruits, and vegetables). Even after layers of emotional and physical clearing occur, if acidic wastes continue to accumulate in the system, the organs weakened by genetics or trauma will continue to deteriorate. Pain will continue to surface. Disease and eventually death are the result. There is not much mystery to disease. Eating non-ideal foods over time breaks down the tissues that have been weakened by genetics, trauma, thought patterns, or emotional patterns. I'll elaborate on what the non-ideal food for humans are. The issue is also compounded by the fact that most allopathic treatments are also highly acidic and toxic. They suppress symptoms at the expense of health and vitality. Similarly, even as we gain mastery over our mental and emotional processes, if our chemistry is continually swinging out of balance, it may be difficult (if not impossible) to feel good. The mind- body connection is profound. The mind can heal and transmute toxins, and a traumatic event can throw someone's system into diabetes or another state of dis-ease. Regardless of the cause, it can be healed with diet. The inspiration to Cleanse a lifetime of toxins I encourage you to create a list of your symptoms, since early childhood, and commit to healing them. Work up the faith that you can be free of them. Dig deep while creating this list. Look at yourself in the mirror; and explore your body for scars and memories... add those to the list. As you go through the days, consider the inconveniences you are painfully aware of, and also the discomforts that you've almost stopped noticing. Add those. They will either heal, or worsen over time and be compounded by other symptoms. If you're not 'improving', chances are you're getting more congested. I often remind myself to look around at what other people are doing regarding diet, and where they seem to be headed, and doing something different... sometimes completely different. Some examples of symptoms: a cough or recurring cough, post nasal drip, physical pain, stiffness, vision problems, tooth pain or decay, postural issues, depression, insomnia, constipation, loss of hair, body fat, bags under eyes, loss of luster in hair or eyes, weak nails, stiff joints, any number of 'disease' labels, digestion issues, bloating, sagging skin, scars, moles, warts, rashes, growths, tumors, thinning hair, dandruff, viruses, neurological conditions, etc etc. All of these are signs that health is deteriorating at some level. They can begin anywhere from infancy to well into adulthood. Usually the breaking down begins early, and the symptoms show up later. For me, a few showed up when I was still a baby. The labeled 'diseases' are just adopted stories for the more advanced states of decay. Usually they are not helpful, as we adopt the 'disease' as part of our identity, which makes it harder to drop. When you say I AM X (diabetic, for instance), or I HAVE Y (Fibromyalgia, for instance). Statements like that re-anchor the symptoms and physiological responses in the body. There's a story in Louise Hay's You can Heal your Life, where a client woke up, and her vision problems were gone. She didn't need her glasses, for the first time in decades. She just kept repeating 'I can't believe it, I just can't believe it!' Like a mantra. When she woke up the next morning, her vision had gone back to what it was, and she needed her glasses again. This list of symptoms is important, so you can keep track of your progress, and approach the issues in a more objective way. You can approach your health HOLISTICALLY until every single symptom is gone. Most of this can be done through this diet, it is just a matter of time and will. To me, that is exciting. Otherwise, you can do what the medical model advises, and attempt to identify causes of ameliorate symptoms individually, usually via means that have side effects, or worsen health generally (medications, for instance, or even some vitamin or mineral isolates). Through fruit and fasting, people have even reported healing issues they were born with, or regenerating tissues they were not born with. This dietary approach reaches into the core with our most vital healing intelligence and begins the process, healing at the root. There is nothing that cannot be healed. Unless you've bought into the medical establishment, where most things are 'incurable; cause unknown.' Healing 'Miracles' on Fruit I recently heard of a woman who did a 60-something day grape fast, and cured her scoliosis. Another man cured a femur he broke 10 years earlier through diet alone; it was bent at 26 degree angle. A person born without L4 and L5 reportedly regenerated them through this diet. (See Dr. Morse Videos on youtube for these and similar stories). Spines and bones realign; degenerated disks repair themselves; cancer vanishes from the body; the skeleton rediscovers it's symmetry again; myelin sheaths are repaired; moles and warts fall off. (Some of these have also have been recorded extensively on the [Gerson Therapy Diet](https://www.amazon.com/Gerson-Therapy-Nutritional-Program-Illnesses/dp/1575666286/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1473352403&sr=8-1&keywords=gerson+therapy+diet), a diet that is much different but with some overlapping principles). I consider it an 8 out of 10 on the healing scale. You can elevate your life experience profoundly through the practices and principles listed here. They may also challenge and trigger you, or you may experience the sense of 'Of course, I knew it!' Either way, consider how deeply indoctrinated we all have been. I grew up in the same culture as you, and suffered immensely for the same misinformation, choosing fast food on a daily basis in the lunch line in high school. Then for 10 years or so, eating only whole foods, sprouted bread, and wondering why I was not healing, later cutting out gluten and dairy for durations; which brought subtle success, but not what I would consider 'healing.' I was always wondering if I was getting enough protein, or, as a man, building enough muscle. I read The Four Hour Body and Man2.0- Awakening the Alpha, and tried a ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting. I got more muscular and leaner, but my symptoms got worse (sinus infection, tooth issues, chest congestion). This approach versus vegan and vegetarian and raw Though this approach is technically vegan, most vegan diets are not healing. They are not fruit based, therefore they are usually too high in protein and fat. Though this approach is technically raw, most raw diets are not healing, since they are often too protein rich, often relying heavily on nuts and seeds, oils, beans, and often limit fruit intake. Though this approach is vegetarian, most vegetarian diets are not healthy, as they rely too heavily on grains, dairy, nuts and seeds, oils, as well as dairy and eggs. So it's important not to try to distill the concepts into buzzwords, or you may lose the essence. And when someone says 'I tried vegan or vegetarian or raw, etc, for 20 years, and it didn't help,' this is a clue that something was off... usually way off. I have a vegetarian relative who only eats Kraft Mac and Cheese, for instance. We are all working with the level of information we have available to us at the time. Also, many people are attracted to dietary concepts because they gratify the ego, and buffer the sense of self identity. I'm a VEGAN, they exclaim, or I'm RAW, and that meets their need for significance. The diet in that context may not be as healing, because it is not touching the core wound; it is adding to it. Cleansing as an Aid to Clearing the Past Most clients come to me for a simple reason; a piece of them is 'stuck' somewhere in the past. So I've spent years figuring out ways of releasing physical and emotional trauma, and regathering and re-centering in the moment. Healing is our natural inclination. I haven no doubt about that. However, many of us live so far from the way we were designed, that healing becomes an uphill struggle. We've barraged ourselves with toxins through all of the sense gates, so the deepest healing happens by purging all of those at once. Healing from multiple angles at once makes it easier to dislodge chronic stories and patterns from the mind and body. For instance, if you are carrying wastes in the system from childhood or infancy (very likely), that is an anchor to that time period. To free yourself of that, let go of the wastes physically. While the cells of the body are perpetually being regenerated, these waste materials are not; they remain lodged in the body. As they clear, through the various channels of elimination, you may experience memories of your past, or cravings from a certain era. This is a sign that you are touching in on the deepest healing. Toxic elements, such as mercury, can stay in the system, and pass down through the generations. Anthony Williams, the 'Medical Medium', says that some of what we are trying to clear is mercury that was rampantly used in the time of our great grandparents. Now we get their genetics, and their toxins, because these elements are very stubborn, and take deep cleansing to purge from the system. (Though after a few days of fasting, levels of DDT, for instance, have been tested and shown to be present in urine). I'll show you a few ways to access the deepest healing in the shortest amount of time possible, so the body can shed these toxins. Caveat: In our culture of instant gratification, the shortest path might still seem long and winding. WE need to let that go, and give ourselves time to achieve what is possible for us. Just look in the mirror at your body, and see where you are strong and vital, and where you may not be, and begin to intend to rebalance the equation. You'll soon know how. Fasting Fasting is the deepest path to healing. We need to get out of the mentality of putting things into our bodies to remedy deficiencies. If you stop purchasing all supplements, vitamins, and minerals now, instead re-routing that income to fruits and herbs, your body will thank you. Nourishment comes from food, and also from fluids, sunlight, air, and what Gurdjieff calls 'sense impressions.' The idea that we are solid and mostly nourished by food can be challenged by fasting, and by researching the amazing case studies of people who haven't eaten for years. Not that I advocate that for you. Limiting food (and often water) for short durations allows the body to make better use of those other forms of nourishment, and to purge deeply embedded toxins. The Stages of Healing First, cleansing needs to happen; the removal of toxins first, and eventually dead and ailing cells. This automatically begins in the fasting state. Second, the organs and the glands begin functioning again. The body's natural intelligence re-awakened. Third, the rebuilding of the body and the replacement of tissues, after absorption and utilization are re-ignited. Sometimes weight is lost in stage 1. The fear of losing weight often prevents men from healing. Sometimes, weight is gained at various states, as the body uses fat to buffer acid wastes being flushed from the system. It's important not to jump ship as these changes take place, but to keep the faith in the outcome. Dry Fasting Dry fasting is the most ideal for healing. No water or food for short durations (a few days can be very powerful). They say 1 day of dry fasting equals at least 3 days of water fasting. If you follow a dry fast with a water-rich fruit diet, many toxins will be flushed out. You'll see the power of the technique through what comes out in the stools. Many people worry about dehydrating on a dry fast. It is not a concern on fasts of this length. 3 day dry fasts are safe for most. I once did single days of dry fasting while doing light farm work in the 95 degree sun. I was amazed that I hardly thirsted. Dry fasting allows the body to begin pulling toxins from the tissue. It will generally work in the order of a vast and beautiful intelligence. Fasting can also be used as a kind of diagnostic tool. Arnold Ehret, a compelling pioneer of dietary healing, recommended a 1-3 day fast to ascertain where the weaknesses are in the body. During a short fast, you'll feel pain in those areas and symptoms may arise as the cleansing begins. Once you know what your areas of focus are, then you can approach them with herbal formulas and a healing diet. Also, working a few days of dry fasting into your lifestyle will create profound results (4-6 days per month). You'll save money on food as well. Intermittent fasting Another powerful tool, for which there are many studies showing its effectiveness, is intermittent fasting. That essentially means fasting for certain hours (from 7pm to noon the next day, for instance). Some people do this daily, and it uses sleep time as a fasting tool. Studies show it speeds up metabolism and muscle growth in athletes. Those on a paleo type diet need to do it, since they are consuming so many toxins in the form of animal products. The most healing food? Fruit. Human beings are frugivores by design, meaning we are designed to eat primarily fruit as our staple, and fruit exclusively during times of healing. Compare our anatomy and physiology to every other creature on the planet, and you'll see that we are remarkably similar to primates. It's so obvious, it takes repeated misinformation to make us question it. The mind has a difficult time distinguishing 'familiarity' from 'truth.' This fact that our ancestors were fruitarian seems to have been staunchly guarded by the establishments since ancient times. Is it because people in the state of true thriving are difficult to control? Protein-rich foods are one of the primary reasons that so many people are getting cancer and other diseases. (You might be interested in reading T. Colin Campbell's [The China Study](https://www.amazon.com/China-Study-Comprehensive-Nutrition-Implications/dp/B0041D843M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1473352540&sr=8-1&keywords=china+study)). This may not be correlated by every study, but research this: people cured of their cancer by a raw / fruit diet (countless), versus people cured of their cancer by a high protein diet (zero). Atkins attempted to use his approaches to heal cancer in the 80's, without success, eventually giving up. Trying to find studies that prove this are difficult, because the various systems in place prevent the accuracy of those. It is much better to use the messages spread across the web and to see what has actually worked for people, in the context of their lives, which far outweighs a written study, which are often funded by questionable sources. Consider why human breast milk is so low in protein, when it aids in such rapid growth and development of the infant. Even compared to the milk of other mammals. \"The composition of human milk. Mature human milk contains 3%--5% fat, 0.8%--0.9% protein, 6.9%--7.2% carbohydrate calculated as lactose, and 0.2% mineral constituents expressed as ash. Its energy content is 60--75 kcal/100 ml.\" Cow's milk is at least 3 times that (though the numbers are difficult to verify), and it is a different blend of proteins that are not easily assimilated. Breast milk is primarily carbohydrate in the form of sugar, secondarily fat, and lowers in protein... a similar compositional makeup to fruit. A direct path to disease is to eat in reverse ratio of this. This evidence seems to point to the fact that humans aren't designed to eat protein rich foods, ethical arguments aside. If you want inspiration, look at the diet of primates, who have a very similar digestive system to us. Primates that are fed protein are said to become very violent and aggressive. Could this be a clue about why the world is as it is? Why is fruit is attacked (for sugar content), why are protein-rich foods glorified? \"Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\" - Albert Einstein What about alternate theories? \"Life is a tragedy of nutrition\" - Arnold Ehret Most dietary theories, as brilliant as they may be, are limited in that they are attempting to balance an equation that is perpetually imbalanced due to improper nutrition. Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine use the elements and temperaments to find balance with cooked foods, advising most to stay away from raw foods. If you are eating mostly cooked foods, I think these systems are useful. However, I don't think they are the deepest path to healing, by any stretch. Paleo or ketogenic diets are popular. Practitioners usually advise intermittent fasting to cleanse out the toxins the diets produce, and to super-hydrate to compensate for the dehydrating foods that are the staples. When a diet is popular in our culture, that is a red flag for me. Hillary Clinton is 'paleo'; let us look at her level of health and vitality, or many others on the diet. Many people are on it, and few are healing. It makes logical sense, and it does not deliver on its promises (I was paleo on and off for a year; and ketogenic for a strict year). I'm not sure if anyone has ever healed a life threatening condition on a paleo diet, and if they have, there are few case studies. Most of my clients who are on it, their symptoms persist or worsen. There are more diets than I can list here, and just bear in mind most are a mixture of 'foods', 'non-foods', and then supplementation (via certain foods, supplements, fluids, etc), to flush out or balance the effect of the non-foods, which is never fully possible in the long run. People get so attached to the systems, (they become part of the identity) that they'll refuse to let them go, even after years and years of limited success. Also, without the list of symptoms, and measured progress, it is difficult to gauge improvement. If there hasn't been improvement after some years, or even some months, try another approach. Keep shifting until something works. A classic example is someone trying to lose weight by using the same approach for twenty years without success (low carb attempts, followed by binging, for instance). Or an Ayurvedic practitioner never thriving themselves. And these systems serve their purpose; sometimes non-ideal foods have not been abundant in our history. Which mean these people at least can live to the 'average' lifespan' in 'relatively' good health. I'm asking for more. Thriving into extreme advanced age. How old are you planning to be when you pass on? Where did you get the number? Have you ever considered it) Start researching longevity, and you'll find extremely long-lived cultures and individuals. [HERE](http://abkhazworld.com/aw/abkhazians/who-are-they/659-abkhazia-ancients-of-the-caucasus) is an interesting link about a relatively long-lived culture. If you eat fruit as your staple, and incorporate fasting for a duration, and work out your emotional wounds, anything can be healed. Once healed, you can refine the diet that works for you. I recommend Dr. Morse's book, [The Detox Miracle Sourcebook](https://www.amazon.com/Detox-Miracle-Sourcebook-Complete-Regeneration/dp/1935826190) . His [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/robertmorsend) is invaluable as well. It takes many hours of information to undo the misinformation. He shares some profound stories of healing through diet and herbs, such as people born without certain bones regenerating those on this diet, teeth kicking out cavities and remineralizing, brain tissue absent since birth reforming. Etc. I am so grateful that we have his videos. I watched them for hours while I was beginning, to dismantle the programmed voices about needing more and more protein that were taunting me. Overview I advocate eating all fruit, or at least mostly fruit, until the symptoms you listed above are gone. Simple. DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS FOR MEASURING PROGRESS It can be invaluable to record where you are when you begin, so you can track your progress. Kidneys Filtering See if your kidneys are filtering by urinating into a glass first thing in the morning, and holding it up to the light, looking for specs. You can also let it sit in the fridge for a few hours, and then, look for sediment in the bottom. If there is none, or very little, they are not filtering, and you are more likely to have lymph congestion, and the corresponding symptoms. Begin cleansing and taking some herbs that focus on the kidneys. Thyroid \"Another telltale sign of hypothyroidism is a low basal body temperature (BBT), less than 97.6 degrees F 4 averaged over a minimum of 3 days.\" (Check first thing in the morning under armpit). Iridology for overall Guideline Iridology is the study of the state of the tissues in the body via the iris. I suggest taking a picture of your eyes every 6 months or so, and seeing how they change. You can gauge progress, or consult an iridologist. Though you may not know the position of every organ, you can easily see general levels of congestion with a basic knowledge. For instance, here is my eye, and the brown in the center around the iris is what I have been working at clearing. I've taken a picture every month. Progress is slow on these, which is why I advocate every 6 months. I do it with an iphone, in a brightly lit room, with a flash. You can also use an iridology camera, if you have one, or shine flashlights from each side of the eye, and take a better picture without the flash. These work for me. What fruit? Dr. Morse recommends melons and berries (including grapes) as the idea foods for human beings. They can repair the nervous system and revitalize tissues, glands and organs. Citrus is great for pulling toxins out of the tissues. The 'Medical Medium', Anthony Williams, makes similar recommendations in his book [Medical Medium: Secrets Behind Chronic and Mystery Illness and How to Finally Heal](https://www.amazon.com/Medical-Medium-Secrets-Chronic-Mystery/dp/1401948294/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1473352951&sr=8-1&keywords=medical+medium) (which are channeled teachings, purportedly). All fruits are beneficial, though they should be ripe when picked, fresh (recently picked), and organic, wherever possible. Frozen are ok if fresh is not possible, or in winter in difficult climates. Professor Arnold Ehret, who wrote some powerful short works on healing, such as the [Mucusless Diet healing System](https://www.amazon.com/Mucusless-Healing-System-Arnold-Ehret/dp/0879040041) and [Rational Fasting](https://www.amazon.com/Rational-Fasting-Arnold-Ehret/dp/1884772013/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1472321360&sr=1-1&keywords=rational+fasting), both of which I recommend, also came to the same conclusion in the early 20th century, and mysteriously died of a head injury soon after beginning lectures on it. He experimented with many types of foods for healing, including dairy, and eventually came to just fruits to heal his Bright's disease. He also performed some interesting, supervised experiments, such as the longest supervised fast known then, feats of endurance after fasting, cutting his skin during different types of diets and gauging the healing process (on a fruit diet, he reports not to have bled, without blood, pain or pus). Overarching Principles The lymphatic system is the sewage system of the body. If it is functioning fully, it can clear out toxins, pathogens, 'viruses', etc. The entire body is brilliantly designed, comprised of systems that depend on one another. One goes down, and the others start to follow. A path to awaken this intelligence is as follows: Stage 1 Immediately cut out all protein rich foods, including animal products, beans, nuts, and seeds, as these congeal in the intestines over time and break down the kidneys. If you do decide to cheat now and again and eat beans, nuts, or seeds, make sure they are soaked and sprouted. They will slow detox and progress. Begin to eat as much fruit as possible. It becomes the staple. Eat it alone, 30 minutes before, or 2 hours after other things (or it ferments, and slows progress). Have as many snacks of fruit as you can. Then, as many meals. Later, as many days of fruit as you can. The system will acclimate. Stage 2 Cut out pressed oils and limit high fat foods. It doesn't matter what the source is... the fats inhibit the body's ability to make use of the sugar, and they congest the system. Avocados, limited to a half a day, or a whole a day for larger people, though they will slow detox, too. Fruit is still the staple. You're just cutting out more and more of the other things that have been creating health complications. Stage 3 Cut out starches, such as grains, as these are inflammatory and coat the digestive tract with a sticky substance. Vegetables now mostly raw. Fruit is still the staple. Work in days of dry fasting. Stage 4 Cut out vegetables and salts. Cooking foods destroys the enzymes, and changes the food does not contain the information that interacts with the body's intelligence. Only fruit, and vegetables in the form of green juices. Stage 5 \"Then God said, \"I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.\" Genesis Only fruit and fasting. With herbs / herbal tinctures, as needed / desired. Do as many days of just fruit as you can, and work in herbs / fasting when you feel inspired, or when you feel your cleansing has plateaued. Arhold Ehret ran a 'sanitorium for fruit and fasting', so you want to think of everything as a transition to fruit and fasting, and work these periods into your life, or heal your underlying conditions and then find your ideal long term diet. Also, remember the other sources of nourishment; work in SUN BATHING, and MOVEMENT (for the lymph system, circulation), and FRESH AIR. Tips Make sure the bowels move at least daily. If you need a boost, try psyllium husk (even more powerfully, mix it with Benonite Clay and Activated Charcoal, as outlined [HERE](http://masterfast.yolasite.com/)), or use lemon enemas (2 lemons squeezed into warm distilled water in a 2 quart enema bag). * Coffee enemas not recommended for this program, as they aggravate the tissues, and we want to think of calming them. Cheating This diet isn't easy. We are addicted to foods. Even some people who know they must change their diet or they may die, essentially choose death over change. \"It is very difficult also to sacrifice one's suffering. A man will renounce any pleasures you like but he will not give up his suffering.\" Gurdjieff. If you notice craving, sometimes drinking some grape juice or eating a large dose of melon can move you beyond it. You can also try a lemon enema. A lot of cravings aren't you, they're the yeast and parasites that have taken over the system. So the cravings can be intense and otherworldly. Moving some of those parasites out, such as with an enema, can be helpful in the short and long term. A massive wave of cravings can mean a die-off is near, as the parasites demand their ideal food. I've listed the above in the order of importance. So in cheating, reverse the order. If you notice cravings you can't overcome, try a salad. Then, starch-less, vegetable soup. Next, perhaps try a cooked sweet potato. Try to get out of it unscathed. Sometimes a relatively free day can help people overcome cravings. Though be as strict as you can, for as long as you can, and keep your vision on the path of healing, and what is possible. Remind yourself how great you'll feel, how inspirational you'll be to others, etc. Watch Dr. Morse Videos when inspiration wanes. For the Ideal Diet: foods must be: Comprised of living water We are water-rich beings, mostly water at birth, and that number declines over time. Breast milk is 90% water. 'Water' is almost the wrong term, because the water in us is not the same as the water that we drink. Life begets living water. So, begin to replace drinking water with the water from living foods; fruits and vegetables. Living water, in this 'container', is encoded with the information our body needs to make use of it, and is hydrating for the body. Drinking filtered water is less useful, and I've experienced it as dehydrating on a cellular level. I've noticed, eating mostly fruit, that I never (or very rarely) drink water. I drink fruit juice and eat fruits and salads. When I do eat a starch, I am thirsty, and satiate that with fruit. When I do this, I urinate much less frequently. For years, I drank liters of warm water every morning (up to 4), with some lemon or sea salt. I think it did a lot to flush out some toxic wastes, and support elimination, however, I was always urinating constantly, even after years of this. It is not useful to continually drink water that merely passes through. Instead, focus on high quality, living waters, herbal teas and the like. Most diets are water impoverished, so people need to chug water continually to even have any hope of breaking even, and usually they are still growing more and more dehydrated. If you're continually thirsty, this is a clue. I wonder if the quotes about living water in the gospels, and partaking of the living waters, and never thirsting again, had something to do with this? (As Johnny Lovewisdom claimed). I became curious about this when I literally stopped drinking on periods of high fruit, and never thirsted, and rarely urinated. Alkalizing The whole notion of acid wastes in the body is quite old. In ancient systems, it was broken down into the elements, and often labeled as 'too much fire in the body.' Some bodies are more susceptible than others, based on their elemental temperament. The body is quite good at getting rid of acids, but when we see how much of what we eat is acid forming (animal products, grains, salt, chemicals, preservatives, refined sugar, stimulants, etc), it builds up over time, until the organs fail. When you embark on the cleanse, one of the first things you'll probably notice is the expulsion of a burning acid through the various channels of elimination. It takes 20 parts of alkalinity to neutralize one part acid, so it is easier for the body to expel it. Avoid cooked tomatoes; they are extraordinarily acidic. enzyme rich Raw, living foods contain the necessary information your body needs for healing. This comes in the form of enzymes. A healthy food should be complete in and of itself. Incomplete foods versus complete foods Proteins and starches need to be eaten with water and fiber, for instance, and seasoned to be even palatable. Vegetables generally need to be supplemented with oil, in order to get enough calories. Also, often they need to be cooked and processed (or juiced) to make the cellulose digestible. Fruit is a complete food with approximately the same protein content as mother's milk. It is hydrating, alkalizing, enzyme rich, nutrient rich, contains fiber, is convenient to eat, is delicious raw without seasoning. It is full of living water, and the source of our most perfect fuel; fructose. Fruit is the argument for itself. Healing Crises At first you'll feel worse, and you'll delve into your symptoms over time, as they unwind. You may experience die-off from blood sugar fluctuations, and may require more rest for a time. You may notice weight fluctuations. The body needs to shed toxicity, and underperforming cells, and rebuild itself, so this takes time. Once you are rolling, you'll experience titillating highs, with the occasional lows as deeper toxins are accessed in the tissues. Give the body time to unwind. Stick with the symptoms for as long as you can. These are really merely symptoms that we repressed long ago, when the body was trying to release something then. I just wanted to mention that, so you know what is happening. You want symptoms while you're on fruit, because it means healing is happening. If you need to slow them, eat vegetables or cooked foods. A few nuts or seeds can stop them, too, though I don't advise that. Meat, dairy, eggs, etc, will not only stop them, but add to the toxic load,so that will need to be cleared out over a few days, before healing can begin again. When a zen monk was asked by a passer by what they did inside the monastery, the monk replied \"we fall down and get up; we fall down and get up.\" Over and over, as though matter of factly. Fall down, and get up again. Do the best you can. Know that healing is happening. Additional Resources Herbal Support Herbs can help usher the process along, and boost the healing of certain organs and glands as needed. Personally, I recommend Dr. Morse's Cellular Botanicals, if you can afford them and would like herbal support. [HERE](https://www.drmorsesherbalhealthclub.com/collections/kits) are the kits for a 14 week protocol, or, if that is a challenge financially, you can pick out individual ones, based on what you discover about yourself or what you learn in the videos. The [GI Broom](https://www.drmorsesherbalhealthclub.com/products/the-gi-broom?variant=1128972816) is particularly good. I'm generally skeptical of people trying to sell products for healing, because 99% of them don't do anything to support the foundational health of the body. Herbs can support, and you can either purchase them, or research and gather / prepare your own. Fruit I love because it is relatively affordable (in relation to much less effective disease treatments), so it is within reach of many. \"Let they food be they medicine, and they medicine be they food\" Recommended Resources I've been obsessed with reading, I confess. Here are a few choice books on the topic that I think will inspire you, in the order that I recommend them.

For the deepest healing, eat one type of fruit for the whole duration, or for each meal, if possible. This simplifies the digestive process, and healing becomes a focus for the body earlier. It may take longer, approximately 1 month per year of symptoms, or shorter if you do mono fruit diets (like grapes only) for a duration of time. But in 14 weeks, you should at least be able to feel symptoms lifting. At the commencement, you'll no doubt experience a healing crisis. If the symptoms get too intense, you can slow them down with some vegetables or cooked vegetables. For me, I had a splitting headache for the first week, and nasal drainage for the first two weeks, very steadily. I explained to everyone that I was not ill, that I was cleansing. Sometimes, you'll plateau, hit a level of peace, and then another healing crisis will show up. I hope this supports.
