If you have any specific questions, please ask your nurse or doctor. Care of your wound that has been glued The glue is a special sterile tissue adhesive (Liquiband) that forms a light film that holds the wound together. Do not pick, scratch or rub the glue. You should keep the wound dry otherwise the glue will dissolve too early, delaying wound healing. The glue will disperse in time or when it gets wet. Please ask your clinician on how long you need to keep your wound clean and dry. Care of your wound that has been steri-stripped The steri-strips (butterfly or paper-stitches) are used on a wound to aid the healing process of the skin. You should keep the wound dry otherwise the steri-strips may fall off too early thus delaying wound healing The steri-strips should then be peeled off gently or soaked off, unless you have been instructed otherwise. Please ask your clinician on how long you need to keep your wound clean and dry. Care of your wound that has been glued and steri-stripped The glue, a special tissue adhesive, holds the wound together and the steristrips re-enforce the action of the glue, promoting wound healing. You must keep the wound clean and dry otherwise the steristrips will fall off and the wound may not heal. Please do not touch or pick at the wound. After a certain time as directed by your clinician, gently peel off or soak off the steristrips in warm water. If your wound becomes red, hot, swollen, more painful or if you have any concerns please return to the UCC/ED, see your GP, practice nurse or your local Walk in Centre. "}
