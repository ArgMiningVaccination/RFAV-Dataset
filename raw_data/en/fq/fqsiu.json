Boehner Speaker of the House of Representatives Washington, DC 20515 Dear Mr. Speaker: I am writing to transmit the enclosed Statistical Programs of the United States Government: Fiscal Year 2012 report, which is required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. We cannot govern effectively\u2014make policy, manage programs, or evaluate progress toward our goals\u2014without the data our Federal statistical sources provide. By placing evidence-driven decisions at the heart of its agenda, the Obama Administration is re-focusing a spotlight on the Federal statistical system and the role that Federal statistic s play in the policymaking process. As we aim to tackle longstanding challenges in an era of scarce resources, it is es pecially critical that we support our ongoing efforts to pr ovide unbiased, reliable, and timely da ta. Having access to quality, unbiased data allows us to make reasoned, disciplined decisi ons about where to target our resources to get the biggest return for our investment, and to identify where we've been spending consistently but yielding underperforming results. The share of budget resources spent on supporting Federal statistics is relatively modest\u2014about 0.02 percent of GDP in non-Census years and roughly double that in Census years\u2014but that funding is leveraged to inform crucial decisions in a wide variety of spheres. Federal data are used to drive and measure activities ranging from shaping monetary policy at the Federal Reserve (the Federal Reserve relies on employment and price change da ta as well as other economic indicators to set monetary policy) to influencing program design and allocation mechanisms (many Federal programs rely on data such as population estimates, the Consumer Price Index, and Federal poverty thresholds) to informing the economic and risk-assessment research used in regulatory policy and benefit-cost analyses. In this constrained fiscal environment, the Admi nistration is working to create savings across the Federal government. Consistent with that effort , statistical agencies have identified program reductions and efficiencies that prioritize funding for core informat ion products. For example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics proposed eliminating the International Labor Comparisons program, and the Census Bureau proposed terminating the Current Industrial Reports. Similarly, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the Substance Abuse and Ment al Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) are prepar ing to achieve data collection efficiencies by incorporating SAMHSA's Drug Abuse Warning Network into the NCHS Hospital Ambulatory Care Survey, and the National Agricultural Statistics Service is aggressively pursuing fuller implementation of electronic information capture as a way to reduce collection and processing costs and improve data accuracy. The Office of Management and Budget looks forward to working closely with the Congress to build a 21st Century system of statistical measur ement for our Nation's performance. Sincerely, Jacob J. Lew D i r e c t o r Enclosure Identical Letter Sent to the President of the Senate One-Stop Shopping for Fe deral Statistical Data Access to the wide array of Federal stat istics available to the public is provided through FedStats on the World Wide Web ( www.fedstats.gov ).

The budget requests an estimated $6,780.1 million for statistical work to be carried out in fiscal year (FY) 2012. Excluding cyclical funding for th e Decennial Census ($497.9 million), approximately 42 percent of this overall funding provides resources for 13 agencies that have statis tical activities as their principal mission. The remaining funding is spread among more than 85 other agen cies that carry out statistical activities in conjunction with other program missions, such as providing services or enforcing regulations. As has been our long-standing practice, this report provides funding levels for three fiscal years\u2014FY 2010 actuals, FY 2011 estimated, and FY 2012 estimated based on initial request. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) recognizes that with the extended Continuing Resolution, FY 2011 was an unusual year, and has therefore particularly empha sized changes in statistical programs between FY 2010 and FY 2011 in this report. The President's FY 2012 Budget lays out the policy priorities of the Administration as submitted to the Congress. The FY 2012 budget information presented in this report does not reflect actual appropriations or the result of overall funding limits and subsequent allocations following enactment of the Budget Control Act of 2011. We r ecognize that FY 2012 statistical program budgets will not be fully understood for some months, and we look forward to discussing these budgets in further detail in next year's report. The information in this report covers Federal agencies (inclusive of organizational units that in official nomenclature are institutes, centers, services, and offices) that have annual budgets of at least $500,000 for statistical activit ies in FY 2010, or estimated annual budg ets of that amount in either FY 2011 or FY 2012. This information was obtained from materials supplied to OMB during the budget process, with agencies providing additional details later, including, but not limited to, details about their programs and program changes, clarifications concerning major budget realignments and adjustments, reimbursements for statistical activities, and purchases of statistical services. This report fulfills a responsibility of OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (Section 3504(e)(2) of Title 44, Unit ed States Code) to prepare an annual report on statistical program funding. The report has three chapters. Chapter 1 outlines the effects of congressional action on the President's FY 2011 Budget request and the funding for statistics proposed in the President's FY 2012 Budget. Chapter 2 highlights program changes for Federal statistical activities proposed in the President's FY 2012 Budget. Chapter 3 describes a number of ongoing and new agency and interagency initiatives to improve Federal statistical programs, including the development and periodic revision of statistical standards and guidelines, various collaborations among the statistical agencies, and selected plans to improve the quality and usefulness of the Nation's statistical products. In addition to budgetary resources data, the appendices include information on staffing levels for the principal sta tistical agencies. 2 The report is available in both electronic fo rm and a limited number of hard copies. The electronic version can be accessed on th e Internet through the OMB web site: www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg_statpolicy/. The report is also located at the one- stop shopping site for Federal statistical data: www.fedstats.gov/ (go to \"Federal Statistical Policy\"). At both sites user s may also access the FY 1997 to FY 2011 versions of the Statistical Programs report. Please direct any inquiries to Katherine K. Wallman, Chief Statistician, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, D.C. 20503. 3 CHAPTER 1: Budgets for Statistical Programs This chapter provides information about agency budgets for major statistical programs for FY 2010, FY 2011, and FY 2012 . It highlights the effects of congressional action on the President's FY 2011 budget request for Federal statistical activities and outlines differences in proposed funding for these programs for FY 2012. The chapter also includ es information about statistical work performed by agencies on a reimbursable basis and about agency purchases of statistical services and products. The budget information for FY 2012 is from the President's budget as submitted to the Congress and does not reflect actual appropriations or the result of overall funding limits and subsequent allocations following enactment of the Budget Control Act of 2011. Overview of Statistical Program Budgets Please keep the following in mind when reviewing the information in this report: Not all Federal spending on statistical activities is included. The report covers agencies that have direct funding for statistical activities of at least $500,000 in FY 2010, or estimated direct funding for statistical acti vities of at least $500,000 in either FY 2011 or FY 2012. Using these criteria, the report includes the budgets for statistical programs and act ivities for 13 agencies that have statistical activities as their principal mission, and more than 85 other agencies (inclusive of organizational units that in official nomenclature are institutes, centers, services, and offices) that carry out statistical activ ities in conjunction with other program missions, such as providing services or enforcing regulations. Changes in an agency's funding for statis tical activities can affect which surveys an agency maintains in its portfolio, the breadth of topics and the sample size of a particular survey, and the accuracy an d precision of statistical aggregates estimated from data. Funding for statistical activities may incr ease or decrease as a result of the cyclical nature of surveys. Such increases or decreases should not be interpreted as changes in agency priorities, but rath er as the normal consequences of the nature of the programs. Agencies also experience increases or decreases in their budgets because they conduc t one-time surveys or studie s in a particular fiscal year. Statistical activities are defined to include the following: collection, processing, or tabulation of statistical data for publication, dissemination, research, analysis, or program management and evaluation; planning of statistical surveys and studies, including project design, sample design and selection, and design of questionnaires, forms, or other techniques of observatio n and data collection; training of statisticians, interviewers, or data processing personnel; publication or dissemination of statistical data and studies; 4 methodological testing or statistical research; data analysis; forecasts or projections that are pub lished or otherwise made available for government-wide or public use; statistical tabulation, dissemination, or publication of data collected by others; construction of secondary data series or development of models that are an integral part of generating st atistical series or forecasts; management or coordination of statistical operations; and statistical consulting. Major statistical programs differ in orga nizational structure and in the means by which they are funded. Thir teen agencies are deemed to be principal statistical agencies whose activities are predominately the collection, compilation, processing or analysis of information for statistical purposes. For most of the principal statistical agencies, funding a ppears as a line item in the President's Budget. Some major statistical programs, such as labor force statistics and energy statistics, are carried out by princi pal statistical agencies (the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Energy Information Administration, respectively). In other cases, agencies have statistical programs that support their program planning and evaluation functions, or that are an outgrowth of their administrative responsibilities. In these cases, the budget for statistical activities is included in the total appropriation for that agency, including an allocation of the salaries and operating expenses for th e statistical program. In addition, a statistical program is not always executed by the agency that sponsors it. In these instances, the work is done on a reimbursable basis by another Federal agency or by a State or local govern ment or a private organization under contract. Whether statistical work is done inside or outside the agency, the direct funding reflects the level of statistical activitie s in support of the agency's mission. Table 1 presents direct program funding for FY 2010, FY 2011, and FY 2012 for major statistical programs, by department and agency. OMB recognizes that its definition of statistical activity is broad and has been interpreted differently among agencies that have provided information on statistical activities. Some have interp reted the scope of statistical activity narrowly to include only traditional surveys and censuses. Others have interpreted the definition more broadly to include statistical methods that are used in the collection and analysis of scientific studies and experiments. For Statistical Programs of the United States Government: Fiscal Year 2012 , OMB provided agencies with improved guidance on what should be included in reports of statistical activities, according to the definition above. Agencies whose primary mission is not statistics were instructed to interpret statistical activity as work that results in statistics, but that also meets at least one of the following criteria: the agency releases, or intends to release, the work as Federal Government statistics to inform public and private decision makers who shape policy, manage or monitor programs, evaluate programs, identify problems and opportunities for improvement, track progress, and/or measure change. 5 Table 1.

The names of certain agencies are i ndented in the table to indicate that the agency is a component of a larger organizational unit lis ted above it and its budget figures are included in the figures reported for the larger unit. Compone nts may not add to stated totals because of rounding. 1 The FY 2011 budget estimates shown in Table 1 re flect, to the extent possible, congressional action in the FY 2011 full-year Continuing Resolution (CR) of April 2012. The President's FY 2012 Budget was formulated based on the earlier part -year FY 2011 CR that was in effect at the time of the Budget's submission in February 2011 (the part-year FY 2011 CR levels were essentially the FY 2010 levels, except for anomal ies such as the reduction from FY 2010 to FY 2011 in funding for the decennial census). 2 The FY 2010 actual level for FNS statistical programs was $28 million more than reported previously, due to the inclusion of a demonstration project for approaches to improve food insecurity among children during the summer months, when school is not in session. 3 National Agricultural Statistics Service tota ls include funds for the periodic Census of Agriculture of $38, $33, and $42 million in 2010, 2011, and 2012 respectively. 4 Census Bureau Salaries and Expenses funds include discretionary and mandatory funds. 5 For comparability across agencies, the following agency amounts include indirectly appropriated estimated salaries and expenses: Bur eau of Justice Statistics ($9, $9, and $9 million) and National Center for Education Statistics ( $17, $17, and $17 million). Amounts in parentheses after each agency are for 2010, 2011, and 2012, and are rounded to nearest million. 6 Funding was rebaselined from pr evious year's reports, based on revised guidance of what defines statistical activities for this year's report. 7 NCHS totals include $30 million for FY 2011 from the Prevention and Public Health Fund. The Prevention and Public Health Fund includes $35 million in FY 2012 for health statistics and surveillance activities within CDC. 8 The difference between what NCBDDD submitted fo r last year's report and this year's report is the inclusion of extramural dollars and additional contract dollars that were not captured in the previous year's submissions. 9 Funds for the National Children's Study (NCS) resi de in the Office of the Director's budget for NIH, in the amounts of $193.9 million, $191.1 million, and $193.9 million for FY 2010, FY 2011, and FY 2012 respectively, which NI CHD uses to fund NCS activities. 10 10 The difference between the FY 2011 Presiden t's request ($1.2 million) and the FY 2011 appropriation ($7.6 million) for NIMH is due to Am erican Recovery and Reinvestment Act funding for 3 new projects. 11 Citizenship and Immigration totals include fu nds from both direct funds and fee revenue. 12 BOEMRE's data submission includes the O ffice of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) information for FY 2010. The ONRR information is included within the FY 2010 actual; however, the FY 2011 and FY 2012 BOEMRE estimates do not in clude the ONRR statistical activities. The difference between the previously reported FY 2011 statistical activities funding estimate ($7.6 million) and the current FY 2011 statistical activit ies funding estimate information ($5.0 million) is attributed to the reorganization of BOEMRE , including the separation of ONRR from BOEMRE. 13 The Bureau of Justice Assistance transfers a portion of the Prison Rape Elimination Act appropriation to BJS for statistical collections car ried out pursuant to the Act, in the following amounts: $1.8 million, $1.4 million, and $0.5 milli on in FYs 2010, 2011, and 2012 respectively. 14 Section 505 of the America COMPETES Reaut horization Act of 2010 re named NSF's Division of Science Resources Statistics (SRS) as the Nati onal Center for Science a nd Engineering Statistics (NCSES). Highlights of Congressional Action on the President's FY 2011 Budget Request The figures for FY 2011 in Table 1 reflect congressional action on the President's Budget request for funding of statistical activities. The following are highlights of the effects of these appropriation levels on the programs of the thirteen principal statistical agencies: Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA): The FY 2011 appropriation of $93.2 million was $16.0 million less than the President's request. The FY 2011 budget enables BEA to maintain \"core\" statistical pr ograms that produce statistics that feed into the estimation of GDP and related statistics, are required by law, and/or are required for the administration of Federal pr ograms. Left unfunded were initiatives to develop new data series that expand an d realign the statistical coverage of the business and governmental sectors; begin publishing a new suite of measures of household income, expenses, debt, and savings; propose a new and expanded account of energy usage in th e U.S. economy; an d improve the overall coverage and measurement of foreign direct investment. Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS): The FY 2011 appropriation of $69.9 million was $1.5 million less than the President's request. The funding will permit BJS to continue to collect and analyze statistical da ta on all aspects of the criminal justice system; assist State, local, and Tribal governments in collecting and analyzing justice statistics; and disseminate quali ty information and statistics. The appropriation also included $15.0 million for the continued implementation of major National Crime Victimization Survey redesign activities, based largely on the comprehensive report prep ared by the Committee on National Statistics and the Committee on Law and Justice of the Nati onal Academy of Sciences. BJS will expand the 2011 National Survey of Indigent Defense Services to include indigent defense work performed by contract attorneys and assigned counsel. As a result of 11 the lower funding level, BJS significantly reduced plans for a redesign and development of data collection programs fo r Indian Country, an d for a Reentry and Recidivism Statistics Program. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS): The FY 2011 appropriation of $610.2 million was $35.1 million below the President' s request. At this level, BLS is implementing two cost savings proposals: restructuring the Current Employment Statistics (CES) program and providing alternative data for the Federal locality pay setting. The CES program proposal restructures the way in which the CES program produces State and metropolitan area estimates at less cost and without adversely affecting the quality of the data produced. An alternative to the Locality Pay Surveys was introduced due to a change in the Federal locality pay setting, which uses data from two current BLS programs\u2014the Occupational Employment Statistics survey and the Employment Cost Index. The FY 2011 appropriation did not include any of the program increases in cluded in the President's request. Left unfunded were enhancing the Measure of Occupational Wage and Employment Growth survey, improving the frame of retail outlets in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), increasing the number of CPI pr ice quotes, supporting a Supplemental Poverty Measure, and an initiative to mode rnize the Consumer Expenditure survey. Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS ): The FY 2011 appropriation of $27.0 million was the same as the FY 2010 enacted amount. BTS will support critical travel and freight statistics programs, as well as work in geospatial data transportation economics, and the information dissemination services of the National Transportation Librar y. In addition, the prog rams received $5.0 million from the Federal Aviation Administrati on's operations account as reimbursable dollars, to support the aviation statistics program. This program collects and disseminates airline financial, traffic, performance, and operational data from 130 U.S. airlines. Census Bureau: The FY 2011 appropriation of $1,177.7 is $117 million less than the President's request of $1,297.0 million ($2 million in funds were transferred to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration). The Geographic Support initiative to update the Master Address File during the decade was funded, and offers the possibility of significantly reducing the cost of the Address Canvassing operation in 2019. The Census Bureau also received $30.0 million in mandatory appropriations: $20.0 million for the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and $10.0 million for the Survey of Program Dynamics. Appropriated funding levels permit the American Community Survey initiative to expand the household sample size to increa se accuracy in rural areas. However, the increase was implemented in June 2011 rath er than January 2011 as requested (the sample will eventually be expanded to 3.5 million households). Initiatives related to improved poverty measures, and enhancemen ts to the Federal statistical system's infrastructure for incorporatin g administrative records into its statistical programs, were not funded. Economic Research Service (ERS): The FY 2011 appropriation of $81.8 million was $5.4 million less than the President's request. ERS continues to fund its core programs and investments in data to better understand consumers' food choices, and to support research on the impact of fo od assistance and nutrition programs, the provision of environmental services from agriculture, childhood obesity, and commodity and international market analysis. Left unfunded was an initiative to 12 establish a structure among statistical ag encies, managed through ERS, to improve its Statistical Community of Practice and Engagement (see Chapter 3 for more detail). Also left unfunded were incr eases to support commu nity access to local foods, to maintain data integrity and confidentiality, and to undertake an administrative records project . The increases made to these programs were offset by reductions in lower priority activities. Energy Information Administration (EIA): The FY 2011 appropriation of $95.0 million was $33.8 million less than the Pres ident's request. This funding decrease forced EIA to significantly limit its planned emphasis in several key areas, including: planned expansion of energy consumption surveys for commercial buildings, manufacturing and homes; addressing energy market behavior and the interrelationship of energy and financial markets; and comprehensive upgrades to the National Energy Modeling System. This decrease of funding also resulted in significant curtailments to EIA's data, an alysis, and forecasting activities, including a complete suspension of the 2011 Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey; broad reductions in the scope of energy supply and marketing data collected and published by the agency; a halt to pl anned upgrades to the National Energy Modeling System; and termination of updates to EIA's international energy statistics. National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS): The FY 2011 appropriation of $156.4 million was $8.3 million less than the President's request. The Budget includes full funding for the periodic Census of Agriculture of $33 million for FY 2011. As a result of the cut, NASS completed a comprehensive review of its entire program. Many internal savings were identified and implemented, including restricted travel, reduced awards allocations , selective hiring, and elimination of on- site agency training. Additionally, pr ogram cuts to elimin ate the Census of Aquaculture; the Tenure, Ownership, and Transition of Agricultural Land Survey; the July Sheep and Goats Report; and the quarterly Agricultural Labor Report; have been identified. In addition the FY 2011 budget will not fund several critical initiatives that were requested in the President's Budget, the Enhanced County Estimates in support of Departmental pr ograms, a rotational organic agriculture survey, and enhanced remote sensing activities in support of climate change research. National Center for Education Statistics (NCES): The FY 2011 appropriation of $305.5 million for the Statistics, Assessmen t, and Statewide Data Systems programs was $37.7 million less than the President's re quest. NCES will continue to fund the Schools and Staffing Survey, the Integrat ed Postsecondary Education Data System, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Class (ECLS-K) of 2010- 2011, the 2011 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, and the Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies. NCES received $42.2 million in funding out of the original $65 million requested for the Statewide Data Systems programs. As a result of th e decrease in funding, the Statewide data systems programs will have less money for new grant awards in 2012. NCES will need to cancel the 2013 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) grade 4 writing assessment, reduce the scope of reporting for the 2011 NAEP science results, and substantially delay or possibly cancel implementation of the Beginning Postsecondary Study. NCES is still considering a few other cuts to program operations, such as reduced non-response follow-up, to the new National Household Education Surv eys program, to reach its appropriation level. 13 National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS): The FY 2011 appropriation of $138.7 million was $23.2 million less than the President's request. Funding at this level allows NCHS to maintain full field operations for the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; conduct the National Health Interview Survey at 40,000 households; collect a full 12-months of core birth and death records to provide the Nation's official vital statistics data; conduct selected components of the National Health Care Surveys to reflect changing patterns of health care delivery and public health; and enhance the quality and usability of data access tools through improved tutorials. The Prevention and Public Health Fund provided funding for content and sample size expansions of the National Health Interview Survey, the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, and the National Health Care Surveys, to perform feasibility testing of youth fitn ess measures in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and for analytic programs in the Office of Analysis and Epidemiology. National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES), National Science Foundation: The FY 2011 appropriation of $41.2 million was $3 million less than the President's request. NCSE S is working on a taxonomy management policy, which will standardize categories used in different surveys; continuing development and testing of a virtual, secu re data access facility that will allow licensed data users easier access to protect ed confidential data; and implementing a Memorandum of Understanding and Interagency Agreement with the Statistics of Income Division of the IRS, to permit sampling very small businesses and more accurately measure their research and development (R&D), innovation, and entrepreneurial activities, in support of a Microbusiness R&D and Innovation survey for firms with fewer than five employees. NCSES postponed the development of an innovation module planned for the Business R&D and Innovation Survey; development of an improved end user data access system; preparatory work on developing a new Microbusiness R&D and Innovation Survey for firms with less than five employees ; and full-scale implementation of an academic sector post-doctorat e data collection system. Office of Research, Evaluation, and St atistics (ORES), Social Security Administration: The FY 2011 appropriation of $31.1 million was the same as the President's request. ORES will continue to support data collections, principally funded by other Federal agencies, that in form Social Security-related analyses; improvements to data quality; and expa nded data access through development of public-use data files as well as both in-house and extramural data analyses and model development. In FY 2011 ORES is completing a contract that makes a number of improvements to its main mi cro-simulation model, including updating the data used in the model and developing a capacity to project selected income items for Social Security Disa bled Worker beneficiaries. ORES will also complete a new public-use file of demographic and earnings history information for a one percent sample of all social security nu mbers that will significantly enhance the ability of researchers and policy analysts to conduct analyses of Social Security Administration programs. In addition, ORES will complete phase two of its effort to modernize and automate processes for producing statistical tables and publications. Statistics of Income Division (S OI), Internal Revenue Service: T h e F Y 2 0 1 1 appropriation of $43.9 million was $0.3 mill ion below the President's request. SOI 14 will support critical base program requirem ents and deliver all planned data files and products to its primary customers. SO I is examining ways to minimize the risk of re-identification of individual records in the Individual Public Use cross-section file and undertaking a feasibility study to develop an Individual Public Use panel data file that would be more analytically useful than the single year files currently produced. Reimbursable Programs Agencies whose missions are primarily or entirely statistical often perform statistical work for others on a reimbursable basis. These reimbursements come from other agencies within the same department or from other Federal agencies, State governments, and occasionally the pr ivate sector or foreign governments. Sometimes data collected by one agency for its programmatic purposes can be used for a different programmatic purpose in an other agency. Further, some agencies have reimbursable programs but do not necessarily perform all the statistical work (for example, the Defense Manpower Data Center of the Department of Defense). Rather, they use part of the reimbursable program money to purchase statistical work from other Federal agencies. Appendix C 1 presents a list of agencies that e xpect to perform at least $100,000 of statistical work on a reimbursable basis fo r state and local governments, the private sector, and/or other Federal agencies , ranked by the estimated size of the reimbursable program for FY 2012 . As shown in Appendix C, of the estimated total of $737.9 million in reimbursable work, an estimated $623.2 million is performed for other Federal agencies. A large portion of the reimbursable work performed for other Federal agencies is funded th rough intradepartm ental transfers. For FY 2012, the Census Bureau has the largest reimbursable program, estimated at $274.4 million. Most of this work ($270.0 million) involves data collection and preparation of tabulations for other Federal agencies. In particular, the Census Bureau expects to perform approximately $98.6 million of reimbursable work for BLS to conduct the Consumer Expenditure Survey, the Current Population Survey, and other tabulations and surveys. Other work that the Census Bureau expects to perform for agencies incl udes the Private Schools Su rvey and the intercensal estimates of poverty for NCES; the National Health Interview Su rvey, the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, and the National Hospital Discharge Survey for the National Center for Health Statistics; the Ameri can Housin g Survey, the Housing Sales Survey, and the Survey of Market Absorption for the Department of Housing and Urban Development; the National Crime Victimization Survey, the National Prisoner Statistics Program, the Annual Probation and Parole Survey, and the Survey on Sexual Violence for BJS; th e Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement for the Office of Juvenile Ju stice and Delinquenc y Prevention; the Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey for EIA; and the National Survey of College Graduates for the NCSES. In add ition, the Census Bureau receives funds from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), other Federal agencies, foreign gover nment agencies, and internationa l organizations such as the United Nations, to conduct demographic, geographic, and socioeconomic studies, 1 In past editions of this publication, Appendix C was presented as Table 2. 15 and to strengthen statistical development around the world through technical assistance, training, and software products. The Geological Survey at the Department of the Interior (DOI) has a reimbursable program of $245.5 million, which contributes to applied research and development. Almost two thirds of the reimbursable income is from other Federal agencies. Reimbursable activities include research projects to provide results used in land and resource management decisions, maintaining long-term monitoring networks, and development of information and decision support tools to make the vast amounts of information available for decision making. A large portion of the reimbursable work in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is done within the department and is conducted through the use of grants, contracts, and interagency agreements. Most of the reimbursable statistical work performed by NCHS ($80.5 million) is done for other agencies within HHS ($70.8 million), in particular for other parts of its parent organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and for the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The National Death Index will cont inue to receive reimbursement from both CDC and non-Federal sources. Reimbursable work funded by non-Federal entities will also support the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the National Health Interview Survey. Intradepartmental tran sfers support much of the reimbursable work of Department of Agriculture (USDA) agencies. Approximately $17.2 million of NASS's reimbursable work is done for other agencies in USDA. In particular, NASS will receive $8.0 million from ERS for the Agri cultural Resource Management Survey. Other USDA agencies reimbursing NASS wi ll be the Farm Service Agency, which provides $6.9 million for prices received by farmers, pulse crop data, and county- level cash rental rates in support of program administration, and the Risk Management Agency, which provides $0.83 million for county estimates of commodity production and yield. Funding provided by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service will support the national animal health monitoring system, and funds from the Forest Service will provide for the National Woodland Owner Survey. Funds received from the Agricultural Marketing Service will support collection of milk and pesticide data. Intradepartmental agreemen ts also support most of the reimbursable work conducted by the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) and NCES. IES anticipates receiving $13.9 million to cond uct evaluations for other agencies in the Department of Education (ED), including $4 million for the Effective Teacher and Leader evaluations. NCES anticipates receiving approximately $7.9 million from other agencies for statistical activities, including $4.0 million for obtaining intercensal estimates of poverty for ED's Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, $1.0 million for collection of achievement data for the Office of Indian Education, and $1.2 million to obtain data on school crim e for the Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools. 16 Purchases of Statistical Services Agencies may also contract for statistical services with other Fe deral agencies, State and local governments, or private sector organizations. Appendix D2 shows the agencies that have total purcha ses of at least $1.0 million, ranked by total purchases. Information on agencies with smaller estimated purchases is provided in Appendix A. When a contract is a transf er of funds to another Federal agency, it is a direct program obligation in the budget of the purchasing agency, and is part of the reimbursable program of the agency providing th e service. Agencies such as IES, for example, may purchase more than th eir direct funding for statistics allows, because they receive the difference from other Federal agencies under their reimbursable programs. The largest purchasers of stat istical services from the state and local governments are the Centers for Disease Control an d Prevention excluding NCHS ($178.4 million), the National Center for Education Statistics ($97.3 million), the Bureau of Labor Statistics ($88.0 million), and the Employment and Training Administration ($43.6 million). CDC funds reimburse lo calities for their cooperation in the reporting of diseases. NCES provides fu nds to State educational agencies to support development and implementation of statewide longitudinal data systems for collecting and reporting educa tion data. States also recei ve funding to support data collection activities. BLS funds support the cooperative labor force statistics program. ETA funds grants to States to collect and an alyze labor market information on growth industries and occupations, to catalogue knowledge, skills and abilities required for standard occupations, and to support an electronic network of career information. During FY 2012, Federal agencies covered by this report will purchase an estimated $2,524.0 million in statistical services, as shown in Appendix A. Almost two-thirds of these services will be purchased from the private sector. Agencies that expect to purchase more th an $100 million in statistical services in FY 2012 are the National Center for Ed ucation Statistics ($365.3 million), the Centers for Disease Control and Preventio n excluding NCHS ($286.7 million), the Census Bureau ($223.2 million), the Bureau of Labor Statistics ($215.2 million), the National Institutes of Health ($147.1 million), the National Science Foundation without NCSES ($144.2 million), and the National Center for Health Statistics ($126.7 million). Appendix A presents estimates of direct funding, reimbursements, and purchases for FY 2012, as reported by each of th e agencies covered in this report. Based on that information, the agencies reported that they expect to purchase an estimated $1,552.7 million in statistical services from the private sector during FY 2012. Of that total, approximately $833.7 million (or approximately 54 percent) in purchases from the private sector are made by th e following five agencies: the National Center for Education Statistics ($246.0 million); the Census Bureau ($221.9 million); the National Science Foundation, excluding NCSES ($144.2 million); the National Institutes of Health ($126.6 milli on); and the Centers for Disease Control 2 In past editions of this publication, Appendix D was presented as Table 3. 17 and Prevention, excluding NCHS ($95.0 million). The private sector provides a variety of services, such as survey design , data collection and processing, analysis, program evaluation, preparation of reports, data dissemination, computer services, and methodological research and development. 19 CHAPTER 2: Programs and Priorities This chapter presents brief descriptions of the statistical activities of the agencies covered in this report. The chapter highlights program priorities for Federal statistical activities for FY 2012 as proposed in the President's budget. Because at the time of this writing the FY 2012 budget has not been finalized in all cases by the Congress, priorities for each topic are given in lieu of anticipated program changes. For purposes of this discussion, the statistical programs are divided into the following categories: Health and Safety Statistics; Social and Demographic Statistics; Natural Resources, Energy, and Environment Statistics; and Economic Statistics. Health and Safety Statistics Health The Global Health Bureau of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) collects and disseminates high quality data used to plan, monitor, and evaluate population, health, and nutrition programs. Data are used in policy development and national health system stra tegies. Statistical activities comprise dissemination of consistent survey methods and questionnaires across countries in order to measure key indicators including infant and child mortality, fertility, family planning use, maternal health, child imm unization, and malnutrition levels; capacity building of statistical offices in developing countries to collect, analyze, disseminate and utilize data to increase the understanding of population and demographic trends; assessing implications for development planning and policy making; demographic modeling; and dissemination of information through a variety of publications and presentations. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) produces and disseminates information about the cost, quality, access, an d effectiveness of health care. AHRQ's Medical Expenditures Panel Surveys provide public and private sector decision makers with timely national estimates of health care use and expenditures; private and public health insurance coverage; and the availabi lity, costs, and scop e of private health insurance benefits. AHRQ prepares analyses of changes in behavior as a result of market forces or policy ch anges on health care use, expenditures, and insurance coverage; develops costs/savings estimates of proposed changes in policy; and identifies the impact of changes in policy for key subgroups of the population. Statistical activities of AHRQ are conducted through the use of grants, contracts, and interagency agreements. The Centers for Disease Control and Prev ention (CDC) in HHS promote health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury, and disability. CDC provides data on morbidity, epidemiologi c surveillance of in fectious diseases, chronic diseases, occupational diseases an d injuries, vaccine efficacy, and safety. CDC\u00b4s top organizational components in clude the Office of the Director, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Deputy Offices, and National Centers. Deputy Offices include: the O ffices of Public Health Preparedness and 20 Response; State, Tribal, Local and Territo rial Support; Surveill ance, Epidemiology, and Laboratory Services; Injury and Environmental Health; and Infectious Dise ases. The Agency for Toxi c Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) along with ten National Centers are grouped under the five Deputy offices. These National Centers ar e: Global Health; National Institute for Occupational, Safety and Health; Envir onmental Health; Injury Prevention and Control; Health Statistics; Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities; Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion; Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; Emerging Zoonotic and Infectious Diseases; and HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Disease an d Tuberculosis Prevention. The National Center for Health Statis tics (NCHS) is the principal agency that produces general-purpose health data. NCHS is responsible for the collection, maintenance, analysis, and dissemination of statistics on the nature and extent of the health, illness, and disability of the U.S. population; the impact of illness and disability on the economy; the effects of environmental, social, and other health hazards; heal th care costs and financing; family formation, growth, and dissolution; and vital events (births and deaths). ATSDR, Division of Health Studies, conducts health investigations, surveillance, and registries that are undertaken to attempt to establish the relationships between the presence of hazardous substances in the environment (particularly at hazardous waste sites) and public health status. The analysis for statisti cal significance of human disease, biomarkers, and other health outcomes in the presence of environmental contamination is the primary use of statistics by the agency to attempt to examine these possible relationships. The Center for Global Health, Division of Global HIV/AIDS (DGHA), employs statistical methods and analysis to support data driven decision- making that aligns with the evolvi ng characteristics of the HIV/AIDS epidemic across resource-constrained countries. The DGHA has seven full-time statisticians that provide global technical leadership, capacity building, technical assistance and other support in statistical and epidemiologic methods to agencies, countries, and staff involved in the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. The National Center for Environmen tal Health (NCEH) collects and analyzes child blood lead levels for surveillance, evaluation, and publication and dissemination purposes; provides collection, integration, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of data on environmental hazards, exposure to those hazards, an d related health effects; provides statistical consultation and services including to quality control programs and external laboratory performance testing programs; and supports the development of the National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network. The National Center for Chronic Diseas e Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP) collects data on attitudes, behaviors, and practices; develops models to determine prevalence and cost of diseases and conditions through predicted incidence rates, mortality rates, and birth rates; conducts longitudinal studies designed to help families, health care providers, 21 schools, and communities develop effective policies and programs to improve the health of youth; examines the effectiveness an d cost efficiency of approaches to improve quality of care, quality of life, and health status; and produces and disseminates state and national data in support of broader initiatives, such as the National Program of Cancer Registries. The National Center for Emerging Zoonotic and Infectious Diseases (NCEZID) supports activities involving surveillance, research, epidemiologic investigation, laborato ry reference, scientific/technical assistance, and diagnostic activities; supports activities by providing statistical methodology for outbreak investigations and disease reporting systems for ongoing surveillance; develops new methods, adapts existing methods, and provides statistical consultation for statistical applications in epidemiologic or laboratory research st udies; provides statistical assistance and training to agency staff; and su pports a national surveillance system for monitoring and public reporting of these healthcare-asso ciated events. The National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Disease, and Tuberculosis Prevention (NCHHSTP) analyzes, monitors, and reports on the extent and trends of the HIV epidemic and of other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs); develops statistical models describing changes in the prevalence and incide nce of HIV infection over time; develops special studies to analyze, evaluate, improve, and target HIV and other STD prevention activities and programs; supports studies of HIV- associated morbidity and mortality; maintains HIV/AIDS case surveillance; provides statistical support to state and local health officials and nongovernmental partners ; and creates mathematical models to project the incidence of infection, the effi ciency of HIV transmission, and the incubation time for AIDS. NCHHSTP also develops the capacity to apply mathematical models of tuberculosis (TB) transmission dynamics in order to assess and project the impact of intervention efforts and to prevent and control TB in the U.S. The National Center for Immunizati on and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD) is responsible for preventing disease, disability, and death from vaccine- preventable diseases and other respirat ory, enteric, and related diseases. As part of these efforts, NCIRD divisions conduct statistical, epidemiologic and laboratory studies aimed at defining disease burden, associated hospitalizations, and deat hs; characterizing disease strains; estimating vaccine effect iveness; determining co st effectiveness of vaccines; and evaluating other co ntrol measures for non-vaccine preventable diseases. Asse ssment of vaccination cove rage levels is another critical component of the national immunization program. The National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) conducts and funds a range of statistical activit ies, including the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System; and provides access to statistical data on fatal, nonfatal, and violence related injuries . NCIPC conducts four studies with the Consumer Product Safety Commission . These studies are the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-All Injury Program, Self-Inflicted Injury, Firearm Injury Surveillance Study, and Assault Special Studies. The National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD) supports State surveillan ce programs aimed at determining the 22 causes of developmental disabilities; provides major surveillance and research programs for both birth defects and developmental disabilities; and coordinates the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, a nationwide case control study aimed at determin ing the preventable causes of major birth defects. NCBDDD funding supports CDC's major surveillance and research programs for both birth defects and developmental disabilities. The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) develops surveillance programs to collect data on occupational injuries and illnesses; provides funding for the collection of occupational injuries and illness data; develops scientific collaborations to assist in the dissemination of new measurement technol ogies for clinical and epidemiological studies; and designs, conducts and analyzes experimental and observational research. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Serv ices (CMS) in HHS collect, analyze, and disseminate statistical data on the Medicare and Medicaid programs; study the quality care delivered by those programs; and sponsor a survey of current Medicare beneficiaries to obtain data on health care utilization and expenditures, including expenditures not covered by Medicare, th e sources of health care coverage and payment, and the assets, income, health, functional status, work history and family support systems of the Medicare population. Statistical databases and ongoing statistical tabulations include: beneficiary population and subgroups; characteristics of providers of service; person-based utilization data; utilization data for service locations; procedure-specific data for physicians and suppliers; longitudinal data on beneficiaries, characteristics, and service u tilization; and tabulations of financial and statistical data from all Medicare-cer tified hospitals and hospital/health care complexes. CMS will continue to sponsor the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, a survey which will provide longitudinal and cross-sectional information on health utilization and expenditures of the Medicare aged, disabled, and aged institutionalized. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) in HHS collects data on general health services, the health prof essions workforce, and resource issues related to access, equity, quality, and cost of care. HRSA maintains the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients and the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry. The Indian Health Service (I HS), an operating division within HHS, provides vital event, health, demographic, patient care, social, geographic, and economic statistics on American Indians and Alaska Natives livi ng in the IHS service areas. IHS relies on vital event (birth and death) data from NCHS and demographic data from the Census Bureau. IHS also provides utilization management, patient care, and morbidity information for those American Indians and Alaska Natives who receive healthcare from IHS. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) in HHS support the design and implementation of epidem iological studies, clinical trials, biomedical and biostatistical research, and laboratory investigations conducted by the various institutes as described below. NIH also supports data collections on health and health-related topics by Federal agencies, industry, state and local governments, and private nonprofit organizations. 23 National Cancer Institute (NCI) supp orts biometric re search on cancer incidence, survival, and mortality by conducting clinical trials of cancer prevention, screening, and treatment; providing statistical consultation and support to research investigators; and developing new statistical methods and adapting existing ones. NCI establishes and supports nationwide surveys and gathers statistical inform ation in many areas of surveillance research, such as cancer in cidence, mortality, morbid ity, survival, patterns of cancer care, cancer risk factors and h ealth practices, cost of care, health systems operations applied to cancer control, and monitoring of progress in cancer diagnosis and treatment. National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) conducts and supports research on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), disseminates authoritative information to the public and professionals on the safety and ef ficacy of CAM modalities work, and trains researchers in CAM. National Eye Institute (NEI) carries out studies of the causation, prevention, and treatment of eye dis eases and vision disorders. NEI statistical activities are performed by the Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Applications (DECA). Statis tical activities in NEI are performed by DECA. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) conducts basic epidemiological research related to heart, lung, and blood diseases. NHLBI supports research on temporal trends and population patterns in the prevalence, incidence, morbidity and mortality from these diseases; risk factors associated with them; clinical and behavi oral interventions for prevention or treatment; and design and analysis of long term observational studies. Statistical data are an integr al part of NHLBI activities, managed by the Institute's three divisions: the Division of Cardiovascular Sciences, the Division of Blood Diseases and Resources, and the Division of Lung Diseases. National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) conducts both applied and theoretical statistical research to identify the relationships between genes and human health, studying both common genetic disorders and rare diseases. National Institute on Aging (NIA) conducts research on aging and age- associated diseases and conditions, including physical and cognitive functioning, using population-based epidemiological and biometric methods. Of special note is NIA's work with the Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics to publish Older Americans: Key Indicators of Well-Being and partnerships with other Federal agencies to make statistical information on health and well-being available for use in biomedical research. National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) maintains the Alcohol Epidemiology Data System, a national repository of alcohol related databases; sponsors a longitudin al survey of alcohol use, abuse, and dependence; and makes available information on alcohol related policies adopted by state governments. NIAAA conducts epidemiologic and statistical research in the intramur al Laboratory of Epidemiology and 24 Biometry and the extramural Division of Epidemiology and Prevention Research. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) analyzes and disseminates information from clinical trials evaluating novel therapies to increase immune tolerance, as well as fr om clinical trials for a wide variety of infectious diseases; stimulates industry development of products and methods to improve point-of-care diagnostic technologies in nontraditional health care settings for infectious di sease-causing pathogens or toxins; provides complete biostatistical and operational support for clinical trials of autoimmune diseases; monitors and coordinates sites conducting HIV/AIDS clinical trials; and provides biostatistical and data management and logistical support for the analys is of HIV/AIDS clinical trials. National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) provides funds for research in scientific fields where statistical analyses are essential tools in data analysis methods, including Bioinformatics, Image Processing, and Computational Modeling and Simulation. NIBIB does not support a unified statistical program, but instead provides funds for research in scientific fields where stat istical analyses are essential tools in data analysis methods. These fields may include Bioinformatics, Image Processing, and Computational Modeling and Simulation. National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) directs epidemiological an d statistical programs that include research on risk factors of adverse pregnancy outcomes, clinical trials for the evaluation of strategies of obstetric management and neonatal intensive care, and data to understand recent trends in indicators of maternal and child health. The epidemiological and statistical program mission is accomplished through in-house effo rts of the NICHD's Division of Epidemiology, Statistics and Preventio n Research; through the support of extramural grants and contracts to coordinate data collection and analysis; and through interagency agreements to support epidemiological and statistical data relevant to Institute programs.

EPA conducts research and studies to provide baseline data and to evaluate and support environmental monitoring systems. Projects include state and local programs to report ambient air quality levels of pollutants and estimated emissions of pollutants from major stationary sources, and projection of future air quality levels through models that take into account past air quality monitoring data and emissions data. Other statistical activities develop methods to document the distribution and determinants of exposure to pollutants experienced by the U.S. population, and methods to measure exposure to and the potential effects of pollutants on human health and ecosystems. The Geological Survey (GS) in the Department of the Interior (DOI), through its Climate and Land Use Change Mission Ar ea, conducts applied research in the environment through its various centers and programs, such as the National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center and Climate Science Centers, the National Geological Geophysical Data Preservation Program, the National Geospatial Program, the Water Resources Mission Ar ea, the Natural Hazard Mission Area, the Ecosystem Mission Area, and the Biological Information Management and Delivery program. The National Aeronautics and Space Admi nistration (NASA) collects remotely- sensed data to improve our understanding of and contribute to improved predictive capability for climate, weather, and natural hazards. Data assimilation is used to provide accurate and consistent estimates of the global distributi on of a broad range of environmental parameters and to initialize forecast models. Research and satellite programs study atmospheric chemis try and ozone, ocean surface height and winds as well as biological productivity, precipitation and the global hydrological cycle, the global carbon cycle and land surface and vegetation and ecosystems, and solid earth geophysics. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad ministration (NOAA) in DOC gathers worldwide environmental data about the oc eans, earth, air, space, and sun and their interactions to describe and predict the state of the physical environment. In fulfillment of this mission, NOAA's Natio nal Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) maintains national data centers that preserve and disseminate the agency's climatic, oceanogra phic, and geophysical data and selected environmental information collected by other agencies. Data Center Operations provides NOAA the operational capability to close the gap in long-term safe storage of and access to the Nation's environmental data and information. NOAA's Climate Data Records program transforms raw satellite data into unified and coherent long-term environmental observations and products. Environmental statistical priorities include maintaining core statistical series that permit monitoring progress in environment and public health protections, and improving climate measurement and forecasting. 39 Energy and Minerals The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement's (BOEMRE) budget request represents an interim step in the reorganization process and consolidates requested funding for the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Bureau of Safety and En vironmental Enforcement (BSEE), as part of the reorganization of the former Minerals Management Service (MMS). The President's Budget reques t is composed of fundi ng increases for resource management functions; safety and enforc ement functions; and administration, savings, and other budget adjustments. BOEM will be responsible for managing development of the nation's offshore resources in an environmentally and economically responsible way. Functions will include leasing, plan administration, environmental studies, National Environm ental Policy Act analysis, resource evaluation, economic analysis and the Renewable Energy Program. BSEE will work to promote safety, protect the environment, and conserve resources offshore through vigorous regulatory oversight and enforcement. Functions will include offshore regulatory programs, research, oil spill response, all field operations including permitting and inspections, and newly formed training and environmental compliance functions. The Energy Information Administration (E IA) is the statistical and analytical agency within the Department of Energy (DOE). EIA collects, analyzes, and disseminates independent and impartial energy information to promote sound policymaking, efficient markets, and pub lic understanding of energy and its interaction with the economy and the environment. The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (O NRR) was also created as part of the reorganization of the former MMS. ONRR utilizes its financial systems and human resources to collect, account for, analyze, audit, and disburse revenues from energy and mineral leases and other monies owed, for the utilization of public resources on the Outer Continental Shelf and onshore Federal and American Indian lands. ONRR serves as a trustee of the royalty asset from Indian trust properties and as an advocate for the interests of Indian mineral owners, ensuring fulfillment of the Federal Government's Indian trust responsibility. Programs in energy statistics will continue to collect, analyze, and disseminate independent and impartial information spanning the complex and evolving energy landscape. A related priority will be to support enhanced energy literacy by delivering engaging, easily accessible content that promotes public understanding of energy and its interaction with the economy and the environment. Soil, Forest, Fish, Wildlife, and Public Lands The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in DOI publishes annual statistical reports on public lands that provide information on mineral uses and leasing, mining, timber, helium sales, animal populations and grazing, recreational uses, fire protection, cultural resources, and revenue. The Bureau of Reclamation (BoR) in DOI collects and analyzes data to monitor water, land, and hydropower operations of BoR developed water supply projects throughout the 17 Western states. The da ta collected are used to analyze the 40 effectiveness of water management activities, hydropower generation, water quality issues and potential climate change impacts. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) in DOI conducts annual surveys to monitor the fish and migratory bird populations, track diseases of cultured and wild fish, measure the changing status of waterfowl and game bird populations, and evaluate harvests by fishermen and hunters. It also sponsors the National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associ ated Recreation, which co llects information on the number of people that participated in those activities and their expenditures. FWS also conducts the Migratory Bird program, which supports the conservation of migratory bird populations and their habitats for future generations, through careful monitoring and effective management. The Forest Service (FS) in USDA conducts the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program, which is the only program that co llects, compiles, arch ives, analyzes, and publishes state, regional, and national inventory information on all ownerships for forest land in the United States. FIA is mandated to improve the understanding and management of our Nation's forests by maintaining a continuous, comprehensive inventory of the status, condition, and trends in the health and diversity of the country's forest ecosystems. FIA also monitors primary wood using facilities through statistical samples and develops statistical techniques to query private forest landowners about their resource objectives and management strategies. The Geological Survey (GS) in DOI, through its Biological Information Management and Delivery (BIMD) assessmen t, improves access to scientific data and information from a wide variety of sources used by GS scientists, DOI resource managers, decision makers, and others. To facilitate this activity, the GS provides funding, often through cooperative agreem ents, to partners in state and local governments, universities and non-governmental organizations. In addition, BIMD engages in applied research activities in partnership with other organizations such as the National Science Found ation, which serves as a major funding source for building a virtual network for integrating Earth science data. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in NOAA sponsors a broad program of statistical activities to support its mission of environmental stewardship. These activities include the design and implementation of statistical surveys to collect data and produce estimates of total fishing participation, fishing effort, catch, economic value, and socio-economic impacts in domesti c commercial and recreational fisheries, as well as the di ssemination of the resulting statistics in publications and electronic forms. The National Park Service (NPS) in DOI supports monitoring an array of natural resources to provide park managers with information essential to resource stewardship decision-making, including information on air quality, water quality, and ecological health, as well as techni cal studies of flood hazards, forest geomorphology, and ground water. The NPS also conducts surveys to monitor the condition of key natural resources in parks to inform park managers of changes in resource condition and the effectiveness of management actions. The Natural Resources Conservation Serv ice (NRCS) in USDA provides data, information, and technical expertise to assi st in the identificati on of natural resource programs and opportunities, clarify objectives, and formulate and evaluate 41 alternatives; assists with the implementation of natural resource conservation practices and systems that meet establishe d technical standards and specifications; and assesses, acquires, develops, interpre ts and disseminates natural resource data and information to enable knowledge-based planning and decision making at all landscape scales. Natural resource statistical priorities includ e collecting data to meet requirements of the Clean Water Act; maintaining core programs that measure conditions and uses of public lands, associated natural resources, and fish and migratory birds; and collections that assess the ef fectiveness of policies governi ng such uses. Priorities also include targeted improvements in the frequency and geographic detail of some of these statistics. Economic Statistics National Accounts The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in DOC has primary responsibility for the preparation, development, and interpreta tion of the Nation's economic accounts. BEA programs include national economic accounts, which cove r Gross Domestic Product and related accounts; and intern ational economic accoun ts, which involve balance-of-payments data critical to monetary, trade, investment, exchange rate, and financial policies. Other BEA programs include the regional economic accounts, the basis for virtually all states' spending and revenue forecasts, and industry economic accounts, the basis for the infr astructure for other BEA accounts and many other key government statistics, such as BLS's Producer Price Index. The U.S. Agency for International Deve lopment (USAID) maintains time series data reporting all U.S. Government financ ial assistance to the rest of the world including both developmental assistance an d overseas loans and grants. USAID's Foreign Assistance Data Base is time series data reporting all U.S. Government assistance to the rest of the world. Program Priorities in Nati onal Account Statistics Priority programs within national account statistics focus on providing more complete and timely information to bus inesses and policymakers to better understand the health of the U.S. economy, including new measures of GDP-by-industry on a quarterly basis and new detail on the financial sector. Periodic Economic Statistics The Census Bureau is the principal sour ce of periodic economic statistics. It conducts several periodic censuses every fi ve years, covering the years ending in two and seven. The Economic Census program activities cover manufacturing, mineral industries, construction industries, retail and wholesale trade, service industries, transportation, and other busi nesses, which accounts for about 85 percent of GDP and 82 percent of the U.S. workforce. Statistics on businesses without paid employees, on businesses owned by minorities and women, and businesses in Puerto Rico are also provid ed. The Census of Governme nts collects state and local data on public finance, public employment, and governmental organization. It is the 42 only source of comprehensive and uniformly categorized data on the economic activities of approximately 90,000 state and local gov ernments, which account for about 12 percent of GDP and nearly 15 percen t of the U.S. workforce. Fiscal Year 2012 is the third year in the five-year cycle of the 2012 Census of Governments. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) in USDA conducts the Census of Agriculture every five years to collect information on the number of farms; land use; production expenses; value of land, buildings, and farm products; farm size; characteristics of farm oper ators; market value of agricultural production sold; acreage of major crops; inventory of livestock and poultry; and farm irrigation practices. The census provides national, st ate, and county data as well as selected data for Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands. Priority programs in periodic economic sta tistics focus on developing the statistical infrastructure for the Economic, Governments, and Agricultural Censuses. This includes developing the address lists for these censuses, printing the millions of data collection instruments, and standing up electronic tools to service respondents' needs as well as capture and process the information they provide. Current Economic Statistics The current economic statisti cs program of the Census Bureau provides information on retail and wholesale trade and selected service indust ries; construction activity, such as housing permits and starts, the value of new construction, residential alterations and repairs, and quarterly price indices for single-family houses; value of industrial output, such as manufacturing activities; shipments, inventories, and orders; capital expenditures; e-commerce sale s; foreign trade, including imports, exports, and trade monitori ng; health insurance coverage; and state and local government activities. The Census Bureau also maintains the Business Register, which is used to generate statistical sampling frames, and for producing aggregate data on County Business Patterns and Statistics of U.S. Businesses. The government statistics programs provide current statistical information on revenues, expenditures, debt, and financial assets for approximately 90,000 state and local governments. In addition to the financial data, the programs provide data in the areas of public employment and payroll, and information on state and local government organization and activities. A principal program change in current economic statistics activities planned is a program increase that will be used to develop new methodologies for measuring revenues, expenditures, and financial assets of publicly sponsored defined contribution plans, and for measuring costs and liabilities associated with Other Postempl oyment Benefits (OPEB) for all public employees. Little information exists on the full scale of unfunded liabilities associated with public pensions and OPEB , and there are no comp rehensive official statistics on these data. Developing new collection efforts in this area will provide public policymakers with a new data source in which to assess trillions of dollars in estimated liabilities of state and local governments. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in DHS collects and verifies tariff and trade data that are tabulated, analyzed, and disseminated by the Census Bureau. The function of the United States Border Pa trol/Headquarters (USBP/HQ) Statistical Unit is to provide statistics regarding USBP apprehension data. As public interest and the debate over illegal immigration and migration throughout the United States 43 intensify, the USBP/HQ Statistical Unit is tasked more frequently for statistics regarding data that is not presently captured. The Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) produces statistics on DoD purchases from educational and nonprofit institutions, and from state and local governments. DMDC also collects DoD contract information in support of national economic indicators and the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. The Economics and Statistics Administration (ESA) in DOC carries out congressionally mandated studi es, such as the annual as sessment of foreign direct investment in the United States and the impact of the Gulf region drilling moratorium. The International Trade Administration (ITA) in DOC collects and disseminates data on imports, exports, production, prices, and foreign direct investment in the United States, as well as other economic data to analyze domestic and foreign market situations. ITA also tracks data on tourism industries and international travel to and from the U.S. fo r many private sector firms. The Office of Travel and Tourism Industries (OTTI) in ITA maintains a web site to provide current statistical data to U.S. companies on international travel to and from the United States; provides projections of international arriva ls to the United St ates; and conducts the Survey of International Air Travelers, pa rtially funded by states, cities, and the private sector. The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) in DOC, through its Technology Innovation Program (TIP), stimulates the acceler ation of innovation in the U.S. by supporting high risk, high rewa rd research in areas of critical national need through projects proposed and cost shared by U.S businesses and institutions of higher education or other organizations. TIP's Impact Analysis Office conducts statistical and economic research in order to assess the impacts of Federal funding and to provide quantitative evidence in support of implementing best practices for Federal support of research and development funding. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Ho using in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) maintains and analyzes statistics on housing and property improvement loans and on housing or property insured or rehabilitated under HUD mortgage insurance programs, including the inventory of HUD-held mortgages or HUD-owned properties. The Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R) in HUD provides data on the volume, characteristics, price, quality, and suitability of housing in the United States; on the construction and permanent financing required to achieve a smoothly functioning housing market; and on the status of the existing housing stock. The Office of Public and I ndian Housing (P&IH) in HU D conducts data collection and analysis projects in support of its mission to administer and monitor public housing and housing assistan ce programs, and to provid e accurate information on fair market rents to families e ligible to receive assistance. The Patent and Trademark office (PTO) in DOC compiles statisti cal information on patent activity by geographic origin, technological subject matter, ownership, and 44 other characteristics; samples patent and tr ademark cases to measure quality aspects in the processing of appli cations; and undertakes customer survey activities. The National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) in NSF collects, publishes, and analyzes data on th e size and health of the U.S. research and development (R&D) enterprise. Four annual surveys provide information on R&D funded and performed by government, industry and universities. The division also conducts a biennial survey on academic re search facilities, including aspects of cyber-infrastructure and a biennial survey of state government R&D expenditures. NCSES participates in international collaborations to develop internationally comparable measures of R&D. The Small Business Administration (SBA) funds and supports databases on small businesses including the Census Bureau's Statistics of U.S. Businesses, conducts policy studies and economic and statistical research on issues of concern to small business, and publishes data on small business characteristics and contributions. Priority programs within current economic statistics focus on research to explore how to collect data on innovation and entrepreneurial activities of very small firms to assess their contribution to the dynamics of the economy. Labor Statistics The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) of the Department of Labor is the principal Federal agency responsible for measuring labor market activity, working conditions, and price changes in the economy. BLS collects, pr ocesses, analyzes, and disseminates data on: employment and unemployment; projections of the labor force and employment by industry and occupation; prices and inflation at various levels of the economy; consumer expenditures; wages and employee benefits; occupational injuries and illnesses; and productivity and technological change in U.S. industries. The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) in DOL supports the collection and dissemination of local, state, and national occupational, wage, and other labor market information, as well as the production of Unemployment Insurance (UI) information, for administration of employment, training, and UI programs. ETA also conducts the annua l National Agricultural Workers Survey that provides data on wage and migration history, type of crops worked, unemployment, benefits, housing, health care, and use of public programs. The Mine Safety and Health Administrati on (MSHA) in DOL collects and analyzes current information on employment and production in the mining industry. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) in USDA collects, summarizes, analyzes, and publishes agricultural production and marketing data on a wide range of items. In particular, the Farm Labor Survey provides estimates of number of hired workers, average hours worked, and wage rates at regional and national levels. Information is also collected on the nu mber and wages of workers performing agricultural services on farms in California and Florida. The Office of Federal Contract Complian ce Programs (OFCCP) conducts statistical research in the field of discrimination anal ysis to advance the ability for the agency 45 to accurately identify unlawful discrimina tion practices by Federal contractors and subcontractors. The Wage and Hour Division (WHD) in DOL supports surveys of occupational wages in selected industries that are us ed to determine prevailing wage rates and fringe benefits for service occupations in Federal procurement activity. Priority programs within labor statistics focus on maintaining and updating key surveys and data programs to provide insights into the labor market and economy with an emphasis on employment and unemployment; longitudinal studies; projections of the labor force and employment by industry and occupation; prices and inflation at various levels of the economy; consumer expenditures; improvements in the measurement of poverty; wages and employee benefits; alternative work arrangements; occupational injuries and illnesses; and productivity and technological change in U.S. industries. Agriculture Statistics The Agricultural Research Se rvice (ARS) in USDA conduc ts research and provides information to ensure safe food and other agricultural products; assess the nutritional needs of Americans; sustai n a competitive agricultural economy; enhance the natural resource base and the environment; and provide economic opportunities for rural citizens, communities, and society as a whole. The Economic Research Service (ERS) in USDA provides economic and other social science research and analysis on ag riculture, food, natural resources, and rural America. ERS produces such informatio n and analyses to inform policy and program decisions made across the spectrum of USDA missions, and supplies the data in outlets that are also accessible to USDA stakeholders and the general public through conducting research, commodity market projections, and outlook analyses and development of economic and statistical indicators. The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) in USDA maintains a worldwide agricultural market intel ligence and commodity reporti ng service to provide U.S. farmers and traders with information on wo rld agricultural prod uction and trade for use in adjusting to changes in world demand for U.S. agricultural products. Reporting includes data on foreign government policies, analysis of supply and demand conditions, commercial trade relationships, and market opportunities. In addition to survey data, crop condition assessment relies heavily on computerized analyses of satellite, meteorological, ag ricultural, and related data. Commodity markets, the U.S. Government, the U.S. Intelligence Community, and agriculture industry stakeholders continue to demand accurate and timely global crop production estimates and weather related food supply issues from FAS satellite imagery analysis as comm odity prices become higher and more unstable. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) in USDA collects, summarizes, analyzes, and publishes agricultural production and marketing data on a wide range of items including number of farms and land in farms; acreage, yield, production, and stocks of grain, hay, oilseeds, cotton, potatoes, tobacco, fruits, selected vegetables, floriculture, and selected specialty crops; inventories and production of hogs, cattle, sheep and wool, goats and mohair, mink, catfish, trout, poultry, eggs, and dairy products; prices received by farmers for products, prices paid for 46 commodities and services, and related indexes; cold storage supplies; agricultural chemical use; and related area s of the agricultural economy. The Risk Management Agency (RMA) in USDA conducts actuarial analysis for Federal crop insurance programs. The Strategic Data Acquisition and Analysis (SDAA) unit plays an integral role in th e Agency's strategic goals to enhance and ensure the integrity of the Federal Crop Insurance program. SDAA accomplishes its mission through the use of cutting edge technology, including data warehousing, data mining and the utilization and integration of remote sensing tools in RMA's business processes. SDAA directly supports RMA program units that are responsible for ensuring the program's product development, underwriting guidelines and oversight activities are in accordance with the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended. The World Agricultural Outlook Board (WAOB) in USDA serves as the Department's focal point for economic in telligence and the commodity outlook for U.S. and world agriculture. WAOB coordinates, reviews, and approves the monthly World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report, which provides USDA's comprehensive forecasts of supply and dema nd for major U.S. and global crops and U.S. livestock. WAOB also houses the Jo int Agricultural Weat her Facility, which monitors the weather and assesses its likel y impact on crops around the world. A central focus within agricultural statistics will be preparing for the 5-year Census of Agriculture program, including coverage evaluation of census mail lists and printing of materials for field-readiness in FY2013. Program evaluations of land conservation, climate change and rural pr osperity initiatives are planned, and community data collection efforts will be explored to most efficiently examine variation in local food access. Efforts will continue to improve coverage of mail lists to include small and disadvantaged farms and otherwise reduce survey costs. Emphasis will be placed on the use of administrative records to reduce redundancy in data collection, burden, and cost. Statistics of Income The Statistics of Income (SOI) Division of the Internal Re venue Service (IRS) collects, analyzes, and disseminates inform ation on the Federal tax system. In support of this mission, SOI annually conducts more than 100 different projects that involve data collection from tax returns and information documents. Three of SOI's largest projects provide annual income, fi nancial, and tax data collected from individual, corporate, and partnership returns. SOI data are also used to produce periodic estimates of U.S. personal wealth, U.S. investments abroad, foreign investments in the U.S., and gains or losses from sales of capital assets. The statistical data gathered, analyzed, and published by SOI are used by Federal agencies, academics, researchers, and the general public to analyze tax policy, project tax revenues, and estimate the ov erall impact of tax law changes on the economy and the U.S. budget. 47 Priority programs within the Statistics of Income program will focus on improving the quality and scope of data on import ant aspects of the Federal tax system. Particular emphasis will be gi ven to statistics that re late to recent legislative initiatives; automating key data editing processes and applying these processes to administrative population data files; improving the coverage and efficiency of sample designs; and expanding data products available to help the public better understand the U.S. tax system. 49 CHAPTER 3: Statistical Standards, Interagency Collaborations, and Future Plans This chapter describes selected ongoing and new agency and interagency initiatives to improve the performance of Federal statistical programs, including the development and periodic revision of statistical standards and guidelines, various collaborations among the statistical agenci es, and selected plans to improve the quality and usefulness of the Nation's statistical products. Interagency Council on Statistical Policy An explicit statutory basis for OMB's co uncil of statistical agency heads was provided in 1995 by the Paperwork Reduction Act reauthorization (44 U.S.C. 3504(e)(8)). Known as the Interagency Council on Statistical Policy (ICSP), this group enables OMB to obtain more direct participation from the agencies in planning and coordinating Federal statistical activities. The members of the ICSP currently include the heads of the principal statistical agencies, as described in Chapter 1 of this report, plus the head of the statistical unit at the Environmental Protection Agency. Because the member s have management responsibility for statistical programs in their respective agencies, their advi ce and cooperation are essential for effective implementation of OMB statistical policy decisions and for planning improvements in Federal statistical programs. The ICSP is a vehicle for coordinating statis tical work, particular ly when activities and issues cut across agencies; for excha nging information about agency programs and activities; and for providing advice and counsel to OMB on statistical matters. In the past year, agenda topics included, among others: exploring opportunities to reinforce the National Academy of Scien ces Committee on National Statistics' Principles and Practices for a Federal Statistical Agency ; fostering innovative practices in statistical agencies and contributing to the design of an NAS workshop on this topic; defining the roles and responsibilities for the newly established ICSP Statistical Community of Practice and Engagement; documenting the policies that the Federal statistical agencies use to ensure scientific integrity, consistent with the new guidance from the President and the Office of Science and Technology Policy; developing a joint response to the National Archives and Records Administration for categorizing and marking statistical information, in accordance with the requirements of E.O. 13556 on Controlled Unclassified Information; continuing the successful \"funding opport unity\" in survey and st atistical research and recommending improvements in the programs and services of the Joint Program in Survey Methodology; furthering interagency work on statistical uses of administrative records by establishing a framework for the activities, exploring aspects of this complex area, and sh aring information about current linking capabilities; facilitating the participation of the statistical agencies in the Administration's Data.gov initiative; and collaborating on a symposium to mark World Statistics Day in the United States. In addition, the ICSP member agencies exchanged experiences, solutions, and proposals with respect to numerous topics of mutual interest and concern, such as work ing with data search, visualization, and dissemination vendors; measuring trust in official statistics; producing a cross- cutting compilation of indicators on how women are faring; developing supplemental measures of well-being; reviewing recommendations from the Center 50 for American Progress on reorganization of the Federal statistical system; and proposing topics of high priority for future ICSP discussion. Statistical Community of Practice and Engagement Increased sharing of statistical protocols and tools for the collection, processing, analysis, integration, storage, dissemination, and visualization of statistical data will provide opportunities for improving data quality, information security, and operating efficiency through improvements in data interoperability and reductions in duplication of efforts among the principal statistical agencies. Such collaboration can ultimately increase the value of Federal statistics by reducing unnecessary differences in definitions, formats, and means of access. It can also increase information security by pooling scarce personnel skills and IT resources across the participating statistical agencies. To demonstrate the potential of this approach, the principal statistical agencies have initiated a Statistical Community of Practice and Engagement (SCOPE) that has undertaken several cooperative projects of widespread interest to the Federal statistical community. These include as sessing current practice and alternative approaches for making statistical pr oducts more accessible to persons with disabilities in compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act; developing a joint statistical community response to Executive Order 13556 on Controlled Unclassified Information; and creating an inventory of statistical software used by statistical agencies with th e objective of enabling centra lized purchase of software across statistical agencies that will result in savings due to high volume purchasing at lower per unit prices. To formalize and enhance these successes, the President's FY 20 12 budget proposes an initiative for the Economic Research Service to serve as the Program Management Office for SCOPE. The program management office would coordinate system-wide projects on standards, practices, policies, and protocols that address the current barriers and inconsiste ncies across agencies. Over the longer term, SCOPE will permit the Federal statistical community to more easily identify and share best practices for Federal statisti cal activities, resulting in significant data quality, security, and operating efficiency and productivity gains in the statistical activities of our Nation. Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology The Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology (FCSM), established in 1975, is dedicated to improving the quality of Fede ral statistics and the efficiency and effectiveness of statistical practice among Federal agencies. Members are selected by OMB and include Executive Branch statisticians, economists, and managers. The mission of the FCSM is to: inform and advise OMB and the ICSP on methodological and statistical issues that affect the quality of Federal data; compile, assess, and disseminate information on statistical or survey methods and practices for Fe deral statistical agencies; 51 provide recommendations on issues of statistical methodology such as measurement, analysis, su rvey methods, survey errors, data collection methods and technologies, record linkage, disclosure limitation, and dissemination of information that affect Federal statistical programs and improve data quality, including timelin ess, accuracy, relevance, utility, accessibility, and cost effectiveness; provide a forum for statisticians in different Federal agencies to discuss issues affecting Federal st atistical programs; and promote and support cooperative rese arch across agencies on issues relevant to Federal statistics. The FCSM carries out a broad agenda of activities and currently has three subcommittees examining statistical uses of administrative records, consent issues with administrative records, and privacy issu es facing Federal statistical agencies. The FCSM has also spawned three permanent working groups: the Interagency Confidentiality and Data Access Committee, the Household Survey Nonresponse Working Group, and the Interagency Group on Establishment Nonresponse. Over the longer term, the FCSM has published 39 Statistical Policy Working Papers as well as proceedings from FCSM semina rs and conferences, which are available through the FCSM's web site ( http://www.fcsm.gov/ ). In January 2012, the FCSM will hold its seventh Research Conference. The FCSM's statistical policy seminars alternate with the bienni al research conferences. Collaborative Research on Survey Methodology Basic research on survey measurement issues, data collection procedures, and statistical issues related to survey design has substantial potential to benefit the Federal statistical system as it prepares to meet future challenges in gathering relevant and reliable data. The National Science Foundation's Division of Social and Economic Sciences, in collaboration with a consortium of Federal statistical agencies, initially supported a special co mpetition for three years (FY 1999, FY 2001, and FY 2002) for research that furthers the development of new and innovative approaches to survey s. The consortium of Fede ral statistical agencies is continuing to fund this initiative. Although proposals submitted for this competition can address any aspect of survey or statistical methodology, priority is given to basic research proposals that have broad implications for the field in general and the greatest potential for creating fundamental knowledge of value for the Federal statistical system. Because methodological problems often require knowledge and expertise from multiple disciplines, this funding opportunity encourages collaborations among the relevant sciences, including the social, behavioral , and economic sciences, statistics, and computer science. To facilitate the sharing of the results fr om these projects and promote interaction between funded investigators and the Fede ral statistical community, the Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology organizes seminars jointly with the Washington Statistical Society and also i nvites grantees to present their research results at the FCSM Research Conference s. These seminars and sessions feature 52 one or more previously funded investigators describing the results from their projects with one or more discussants from Federal agencies. Statistical Confidentiality and Data Sharing The Confidential Information Protection an d Statistical Efficiency Act of 2002 (CIPSEA) establishes a uniform set of safe guards to protect the confidentiality of individually identifiable information acquired from the public for statistical purposes, and strong criminal penalties for inappropriate disclosure of such information. The legislation reaffirms that pledges of confidentiality will be honored and gives additional weight and stat ure to policies that statistical agencies have pursued for decades, as suring respondents who provid e statistical information that their responses will be held in confidence and will not be used against them in any government action. CIPSEA also authorizes the sharing of business data among the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and the Census Bureau. Thus it provides a framework to enhance the efficiency of the Federal statistical syst em by reducing reporting burden on the public and strengthening the quality and usefulness of the Nation's Federal statistics. A companion legislative proposal would make complementary changes to provisions set forth in the \"Statistical Use\" section of the Internal Revenue Code. These changes would represent the first major revision of these policies in decades, reducing the amount of sensitive tax inform ation that will change hands to support statistical programs while substantially increas ing the effectiveness of that support. A legislative proposal to acco mplish these aims was developed by BEA, BLS, and the Census Bureau in collaboration with OMB's Statistical and Science Policy Office; endorsed by the Treasury Department; and submitted to the Congress. To assist agencies in implementing the confidentiality provisions of CIPSEA, OMB issued implementation guidance in the Federa l Register on June 15, 2007. The guidance is available on OMB' s web site at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg_statpolicy/ . The Interagency Confidentiality and Data Access Committee (CDAC), which operates under the auspices of the FC SM, considers common technical and non- technical issues involving data access, conf identiality, and disclosure limitation. The group has several products that are available on its web site (http://www.fcsm.gov/com mittees/cdac/cdac.html ), including generalized software for auditing suppression patterns in tables and best practices for disclosure limitation. CDAC sponsors seminars and members conduct tutorials on confidentiality under the auspices of the Washington Statistical Society and other organizations to promote discussion of techniques and issues related to the protection of confidential data. Statistical Uses of Administrative Data Leaders within and outside the Federal stat istical system recognize the vast, largely untapped, potential of many datasets held by program, administrative, or regulatory agencies. Such data are often precisely th ose that are difficult to collect accurately and affordably, or with accept able respondent burden, via sample surveys. Their use can increase the quality, coverage, or analyti cal texture of statistical data series. 53 In 2007, the FCSM established an interagency subcommittee to identify opportunities for using administrative data and to address barriers to their use. The group documented a series of barriers\u2014stati stical agency access, inadequate agency infrastructure, underdeveloped methods to measure and ensure data quality, and researcher access to data\u2014that until now have limited statistical use of administrative records. To help addre ss these, the subcommittee has developed a model agreement for data sharing, model informed consent materials, and early versions of a data quality documentation and evaluation tool. It continues to identify opportunities to collaborate across statistical agencies to address common methodological challenges in using administrative data for statistical purposes. Yet those efforts alone will not be sufficient to fully address the identified barriers. To complement these efforts, ICSP member agencies are collaborating on a set of system-wide pilot projects to advance the statistical uses of administrative data. The President's budget for FY 2012 includes funding to allow full implementation of these efforts. The initiative comprises a series of three pilot projects designed to address barriers systematically. The goal of the first pilot project is to simulate the 2010 Census using administrative records, in order to thoroughly examine and document the coverage and quality of major administrative records data sets, while also building an infrastructure sufficient to support research on potential administrative records applicat ions for the 2020 census. The second pilot, which is designed to benefit from the same infras tructure, evaluates a new, collaborative process designed to facilitate the linkage of survey data to health care records with the aim of advancing research on key health policy questions, including the relationship of risk factors, such as obes ity, with utilization and cost of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. This pilot will evaluate the feasibility and potential quality and efficiency advantages of having the Census Bureau conduct the processing that allows the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) to link its health survey data with administrative data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, while protecting the confidentiality of the NCHS respondents. The third pilot will acquire and use state-level data to understand how nutrition assistance and other government assistance programs work together to provide a social safety net and a better assessment of how such programs work together with health care policy to improve dietary and he alth outcomes. The eventual goal of the third pilot is to motivate Federal-level act ivity to address anticipated data quality and data access concerns. Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics The Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics, initially established in 1994, fosters coordination, collaboration, and integration of Federal data on child and family concerns and conditions. In April 1997, the Forum was formally established through Executive Order No. 13045 to develop priorities for collecting enhanced data on children and youth, improve the reporting and dissemination of information on the status of children to the policy community and the general public, and produce more complete data on children at the state and local levels. In July 2011, the Forum issued its full report, America's Children: Key National Indicators of Well -Being which incorporated updates to 41 key indicators, covering family and social environment, economic circumstances, health care, physical environment and safety, behavior, education, and health. It also highlighted a special feature on adoption. In 2012, the Forum will publish the next condensed 54 version of the America's Children in Brief: Key National Indicators of Well-Being report. To broaden outreach efforts, th e Forum maintains its web site, http://www.childstats.gov , responding to thousands of requests for data on child and family well-being that cut across the domains of its member agencies. The web site includes previous America's Children: Key National Indicators of Well-Being reports, other Forum reports, detailed tables (downloadable), and general information about the Forum. In add ition, the Forum created a Research and Innovation Committee charged with identifying, informing and advising the Forum on gaps in current Federal data and indicators and ways to address them. This group has identified early childhood development as a critical data gap and plans to engage Federal and non-Federal partners in the development of an Early Childhood Workshop and other collaborative strategies to attempt to fill these gaps. Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics The Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics, established in 1986 by the National Institute on Aging in cooperation with the National Center for Health Statistics and the Census Bureau, fosters collaboration among Federal agencies that produce or use statistical data on the older population. The Forum played a key role in improving aging-related data by encouraging cooperation and data sharing among agencies, furthering professional collabor ation across disciplines, and compiling aging-related statistical data in a centralized location. In 1998, the Forum was reorganized and expanded to include several new members. The most recent version of the Forum's periodic report Data Sources on Older Americans was released in January 2010. The report is availabl e on the Forum's web site at http://www.agingstats.gov . In July 2010, the Forum released its fifth chart book Older Americans 2010: Key Indicators of Well-Being . The chart book monitors the health and well-being of older Americans through a broad range of indicators in five important areas: populati on, economics, health status, health risks and behaviors, and health care. The next version of Older Americans: Key Indicators of Well-Being will be released in May 2012. Measuring Relationships in Federal Household Surveys Legal and societal changes have resulted in increasingly complex family configurations, living arrangements, and marital and household relationships. These changes are challenging the frameworks and tools that Federal statistical agencies have for measuring and reporting household relationships and marriage data. Most recently, there has been sign ificant attention focused on the Census Bureau's treatment of data reflecting family relationships, particularly with respect to same-sex couples who report that they are marr ied. The analysis and discussion around these issues have highlighted the need for a further understanding of how to measure and report data on marriage and relationships in Federal surveys. As a result, Commerce Secretary Locke asked the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in accordance with its responsibilities for developing and issuing standards for the collection and tabulation of Federal statistics, to establish an inter-agency task force to examin e issues related to collecting and tabulating data on relationships. 55 A meaningful examination of the measurement of marital and household relationships necessitates a dialogue among ag encies that use these kinds of data to develop policies or monitor and administer programs as well as the statistical agencies that collect these data. For exam ple, it is critical to consider which concepts fit the needs of the Federal agenci es that use the data, what questions need to be asked to measure these concepts, and how the results should be tabulated and disseminated to be most useful. In 2010, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) established an Interagency Work Group on Measuring Relationships in Federal Household Surveys (MRFHS). Representatives were invited from agencies that use and produce these data. The mission of this task force is to research the complex facets of the measurement of marital and household relationships, consider the uses of the data and implications and effects for programs and for measurement, and prepare recommendations to OMB and other Federal agencies for the development and testing of questions to more accurately capture data on marriage and family relationships. The MRFHS work group is ex amining the current practices of the Federal agencies for collecting, editing, and reporting data on relationships and marriage, with special focus on statistical surveys that are widely used. The Census Bureau has recently conducted a number of focus groups around the country to identify alternative wording and ways of asking questions on relationships. In-depth cognitive interviews were then conducted by the Ce nsus Bureau on the different versions of questions that were developed. The Work Group will be reviewing the results of this research and current agency practices to develop further plans for testing new and alternative questions. Eventually, it is expected that the Work Group will make recommendations to OMB on questions to implement in major household surveys. Enhancing Internationally Comparable Measures of Disability The Washington Group on Disability Statistics, established by the United Nations Statistical Commission, is a co operative effort among nati onal statistical offices of developed and developing countries, international statistical organizations, and international organizations representing persons with disabilities working to develop internationally comparable disability measures for censuses and national surveys. Other goals of the group include: improving the collection and interpretation of information on disability, enhancing comparability with other national and international data collections, and providing more detailed information necessary to fully understand the complexities of disability. The Joint United Nations Economic Commission for Europe/World Health Organization/Eurostat Task Force on Meas uring Health Status, also known as the Budapest Initiative, was organized in 2005 under the Work Programme of the Conference on European Statisticians. Its main purpose is the development of an internationally accepted standard set of quest ions for assessing ge neral health status in the context of population interview surveys. The sets of questions from both the Washington Group and Budapest Initiative have undergone multiple rounds of both cognitive and field tests in Africa, South America, North America, and Asia. To date about twenty countries have indicated they intend to use the short set of six questions in the current round of national censuses. In the United States, a disability module that is consistent with United 56 Nations Principles and Recommendations for Population and Housing Censuses (http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sources/census/docs/P&R_Rev2.pdf ) has been incorporated into the American Community Su rvey (ACS). The ACS questions were also added to the Current Population Survey and the National Crime Victimization Survey in 2008, and have been included in the National Health Interview Survey since 2009. Following the completion and adoption of the short set of questions, work began on the development of extended sets of questions for use as components of population surveys, as supplements to surveys, or as the core of a disability survey. The extended sets of questions incorporate additional functional domains and added detail regarding functioning with and without assistive technology/assistance and information on age at onse t, and the impact of the functional difficulty on performing daily activities. With the backing of the United Nations Econom ic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, an extended set of disability questions was cognitively and field tested in 6 Southeast Asian countries. The first extended set of disability questions is complete and was subsequently presented to Eurostat for inclusion on the European Health Interview Survey. All papers and products of the Washington Group are available at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/washington_group.htm . Papers and products of the Budapest Initiative are available at http://www.unece.org/stats/documents/2005.11.health.htm. Improving Data Systems on Health and Health Care Increasingly complex public health and health policy issu es require more sophisticated statistical systems. To rema in effective, data systems must meet the challenge of maintaining current operations while retooling to meet new data needs and utilize more fully new technology and methods. Collectively, these mechanisms gather information that people can provide in interviews; information that people do not know or cannot describe adequately, but that can be obtained through examinations and medical records; and information on the circumstances of significant health events that can be ob tained through birth and death records and the compilation of data on medical encoun ters. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) is pursuing a number of efforts to maintain and improve the core capacity of ongoing data systems. To address data needs in an environment of increasing costs, NCHS has begun a long-range effort for a major redesign of the health surveys as well as the health care and vital statistics programs. NCHS is in the process of integrating the data collected from two hospital surveys into one survey called the National Hospital Care Survey (NHCS). Beginning in 2011, NCHS is recruiting a new sample of hospitals for this new survey . During this first year the survey will replace the National Hospital Discharge Survey, and hospitals will provide data on inpatients. In 2013, the sampled hospitals for the NHCS will be asked to provide data on the utilization of health care provided in their emergency and outpatient departments, and ambulatory surgery centers, thus integr ating the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys into the NHCS. NCHS is also to designing a National Survey of Long-Term Care Providers (NSLTCP), which will integrate and replace the National Nursing Home Survey and the National Home and Hospice Care Survey. NSLTCP will consist of a unified, 57 common set of core data elements using surveys and administrative data. The NSLTCP expands the coverage of paid, regulated long-term care providers, and allows for estimates of the national supply and use of nursing homes, residential care facilities, home health care agencies, adult day service centers, and hospices. The first fielding of NSLTCP surveys is planned for late 2012. Current efforts to preserve co ntinuity in critical data on births and deaths come at a time of significant opportunity for longer term gains in the underlying vital registration systems that state agencies and partners use to obtain these data. Work continues on the development of minimum standards for birth certificates and their issuance in compliance with the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, Section 7211. This act requires development of Federal regulations to improve the security and integrity of birth records processing. Implementation of the revisions will lead states to work with hospitals and funeral homes to build electronic vital registration systems, with secure Internet tran smissions, to State authorities and ultimately Federal partners. The systems developed to implement these regulations can be an important source of more timely information on births and deaths. Work is also underway to make significant improvements in the timeliness and quality of vital statistics data including expansion of electronic registration of vital events, quality review at data entry, faster processing, and more timely publication of key indicators. Developing New Survey Items on Educational Certificates and Industry-Recognized Certifications Attaining a postsecondary credential ha s become increasingly important for securing jobs in the United States. However, degrees awarded through credit- bearing instruction in traditional higher education institutions comprise only a portion of subbaccalaureate education. Data limitations have precluded any analysis of the economic re turns of alternative creden tials such as educational certificates and industry-reco gnized certifications. In 2009, the Council of Economic Advisers and the Office of Management and Budget began an interagency collaboration with the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the Bureau of Labor Stat istics, and the Census Bureau to develop new survey items for Federal data collecti ons that measure edu cation and training. NCES provided support for an interagency working group's effort to design and implement a rigorous process of item development that included consultations with experts on certificates and cer tifications, a review of relevant research literature and previous data collections, focus groups, cognitive interviews, and a pilot study with a nationally-representative address-based sample to evaluate questionnaire items used to identify adults with certificates and certifications (including licenses). Analysis of the pilot study data focused on measurement properties of potential questionnaire items that could comprise a parsimonious set of items to most accurately identify adults with certificates and certificatio ns/licenses. Based on the analysis results, the working group has identified a single survey question to identify holders of certifications/licenses with reasonable precision; NCES is planning to include this single question in upcoming surveys that ask young adults and adults about education and traini ng. The Census Bureau and BLS are 58 discussing the potential inclusion of this item in future administrations of the American Community Survey and the Current Population Survey. The question regarding educational certificates requires continued development. The working group is recommending additional cognitive studies and a larger seeded sample on certificates, in order to develop a question or set of questions that can be used to enumerate the prevalence of these credentials among U.S. adults. Supplemental Poverty Measure Poverty is a critical indicator of how widely prosperity is shared in our economy and is a key benchmark for targeting resources toward the disadvantaged. The U.S. poverty measure was developed in the 1960's and has not been substantially changed since then. As such, it is based on outdated assumptions and does not take into account the availability of many economic resources. In particular, the official measure does not include many government transfer programs, and hence, cannot be used to evaluate the impact of anti- poverty programs. It has been widely criticized for decades. The Office of Ma nagement and Budget has requested the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau to develop a Supplemental Poverty Measure that will offer a complementary perspective on the distribution of economic deprivation provided by the offi cial measure. The President's budget request for FY 2012 includes funding to support this development. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is proposing to modify the Consumer Expenditure (CE) survey to support the Census Bureau in its development of a supplemental statistical poverty measure using CE data. In FY 2012, BLS will begin development of questions to add to the CE Interview Survey to support this supplemental measure. Additional questions may be added on topics such as school breakfasts or lunches, or subsidies for utilities. BLS also will improve its processing systems in order to release 2011 CE publication tables in early September 2012. With continued improvement to its processing systems, by FY 2016, the CE could support the September release date of the Census income and poverty report by providing the supplemental poverty thresholds to the Census Bureau in early August. The Census Bureau will use the poverty thresholds developed by BLS and the National Academy of Sciences' (NAS) 1995 recommendations for family resources as the basis for a definition of income that is much broader than the current official measure. Several of the components of su ch an improved measur e are not currently collected by the Census Bureau in the Cu rrent Population Survey 's Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC) or the American Community Survey (ACS) and must be modeled. The Census Bureau plans to expand its research and production capacities, and work in coordination with BLS, to complement the official poverty measures with annual supplemental measures of poverty based on data from the CPS ASEC (and eventually the ACS) that follow the NA S recommendations. The Census Bureau plans to: expand its data collection efforts to add the questions needed to produce the supplemental poverty measure including questions on mortgages and property 59 value, childcare expenses, child support expenses, and out-of-pocket medical expenses; evaluate, improve, and expand its modeling and estimation techniques to produce the necessary additional resource components on a timely basis; develop a staff who will evaluate and update these measures and work with stakeholders to ensure that the measure continues to reflect best practices and takes full advantage of the information available to the Census Bureau; and consider expanding the measure to use da ta from additional surveys, particularly the ACS, so states and localities can take advantage of this supplemental poverty measure. Decennial Census Fiscal Year 2012 is the first year of a th ree-year research and testing phase of the 2020 Census. Key program activities will lay the foundation for managing and testing new decennial census systems and methods. In FY 2012, the Census Bureau will develop plans for operationalizing and assessing the research agenda; conduct qualitative tests for evaluating response options, including electronic modes; develop concept models for measuring the error in the Master Address File; and develop administrative records research plans to focus on decennial needs. Additionally, it will begin architectural development for placing the IT infrastructure for the 2020 Census into the Census Bureau's architecture, and benchmark the integrated IT infrastructure and field automation logic and high-level requirements for early prototyping. Finally, the Census Bureau will establish critical plans for ensuring integrated and effective management of the 2020 Census program, such as risk management. American Community Survey The President's FY 2012 budget request will sustain efforts to build on the Census Bureau's accomplishments this decade in the 2010 decennial census program, particularly through completing the expansion of the sample of the American Community Survey (ACS) to 3.5 million households per year. This expansion will provide the sample size nece ssary to increase accuracy of rural area estimations. The ACS is sent monthly to a small percentage of the population and collects detailed information on the characteristics of population and housing on an ongoing basis. These data previously were collected only in census years in conjunction with the decennial census. After years of development and testing, the Census Bureau implemented the ACS nationwide in 2005. The ACS allows Federal agencies, State governments, Tribal officials, and local customers to make decisions based on current information, rather than on data collected nine or more years ago. The Census Bureau produces tract-level data (in general, areas with populations between 1,500-8,000 people) similar to the Census 2000 long-form (detailed characteristics) data, in conjunction with the 2010 Census short-form (basic characteristics) data. The Census Bureau releases the estimates from the ACS each year, based on the previous year's data co llection. The Census Bureau released the first set of estimates covering areas w ith populations under 20,000 in December 2010. Estimates are now available for every state, county, city, town, place, American Indian Area, Alaska Native Area , and Hawaiian Home Land, as well as for census tracts and block groups. 60 Geographic Support System In FY 2011, the Census Bureau implemen ted an initiative to improve the Census Bureau's Geographic Support Systems (GSS) Program. The GSS initiative builds on the accomplishments of this decade's Master Address File/Topologically Integrated Geocoding and Referencing System (MAF/TIGER) Enhancement Program, which redesigned the MAF/TIGER database, improved the positional accuracy of TIGER spatial features, and emphasized quality measurement. The GSS initiative is an integrated program of improved address coverage, continual spatial feature updates, and enhanced quality assessment and measurement that all contribute to MAF improvement. Continual updates will provide improved address coverage and feature updates for the ACS sample and other Census Bureau surveys throughout the d ecade. These efforts are expected to lead to in creased efficiency of field staff work for ongoing surveys, as well as improved data collection and data dissemination programs. In addition, this initiative would allow the Census Bureau to pursue a targeted address canvassing operation (as opposed to a 100 percent operation) for the 2020 Census. These efforts continue in FY 2012 and future out- years. Sample Redesign for Demographic Surveys Following each decennial census, the Demographic Surveys Sample Redesign program provides new, updated, and coordinated samples for major ongoing household surveys. In clos e collaboration with other Fe deral statistical agencies, the Census Bureau selects new samples to reflect shifts in the location and characteristics of people based on the most recent information abou t the population. Recently, the Census Bureau began to shift the next sample redesign toward using a continually updated Master Address File and American Community Survey data to select household survey samples, rather than rely on the once-a-decade availability of census data. In FY 2012, the Demographic Surveys Sample Redesign program will continue efforts to build an infrastructure to allow the Census Bureau to select samples of areas and housing units to respond quickly to changing information needs of the Federal Government. Survey of Income and Program Participation For the past two decades, the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) has been the leading source of data on the economic well-being of Americans. The SIPP collects the source and amount of income, labor force information, program participation and eligibility data, and ge neral demographic characteristics to measure the effectiveness of existing federal, state, and local pr ograms, to estimate future costs and coverage for government programs such as food stamps, and to provide improved statistics on the distribution of income and measures of economic well-being in the country. In September 2008, a new panel of 45,000 households was fielded, using the same instrument as that used for the 2004 SIPP panel. This 2008 panel is planned to continue through 2013. The Census Bureau is currently re- engineering the SIPP and, as such, is clos ely collaborating with the user community to assure that user requirements and concer ns continue to be met. Current plans call for completing the re-engineering of the SIPP system by the end of 2013. This re- 61 engineering includes incorporating the Event History Calendar methodology of interviewing into a new automated data collection instrument to improve respondent recall and re-engineering the post data co llection data processing system. An integral part of this re-engineering is a series of field tests of the new instrument, with the resulting data being compared to data from the 2008 Panel of the current SIPP for the same time period. Additionally, evaluation of the quality of data obtained from the new instrument includes comparing survey field test responses to selected administrative records (e.g. SNAP\u2014formerly known as Food Stamps\u2014 administrative data) for the same respondents. Plans are to expand this use of administrative records in evaluating SIPP data quality to cover more program benefits and geographic coverage areas in the future. Measuring Green Jobs In FY 2010, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) began an initiative to collect data on green jobs. The resulting information will assist policymakers in planning policy initiatives and understanding their impact on the labor market, and will facilitate the monitoring of labor market developments related to protecting the environment and conserving natural resources. BLS activities also will be useful to businesses and job seekers, as well as to state labor mark et information offices in their efforts to meet the needs of their customers. BLS is using two approaches in identifying green economic activity and measuring associated jobs: (1) an output approach , which identifies es tablishments that produce green goods and services and counts the associated jobs, and (2) a process approach, which identifies establishmen ts that use environmentally-friendly production processes and practices and counts the associated jobs. For the output approach, the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) program is conducting the Green Goods and Services (GGS) survey, sampling from a wide set of industries that directly produce green goods and services. Also, the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) program is complementing the GGS data by collecting information on occupational staffing patterns and wages in establishments that produce green goods and services. For the process approach, the OES program developed a special empl oyer survey, the Green Technologies and Practices (GTP) survey, to test the feasibil ity of collecting data on jobs associated with the use of environmentally-friendly production processes. The GTP survey will identify whether an establishment uses any such processes; determine whether it employs any workers whose primary duties relate to those processes; and collect information on the number, and occupation s and wages, of these workers. In addition to these activities, the Employment Projections (EP) program is producing and publishing green caree r information. In FY 2012, the QCEW program will publish the first set of industry employment data on the green economy. Also in FY 2012, the OES program will publish its first set of estimates on occupational staffing patterns and wages at establishments producing green goods and services. In addition, as part of this initiative, the OES program will publish results from a special employer survey to collect information on the occupations of workers involved in environmentally-friendly production processes from a sample of business establishments. Lastly, the EP program will continue to publish green career information. 62 Improving Foreign Trade Statistics Official U.S. import and export statisti cs record the physical movement of merchandise between the United States and foreign countries. Foreign trade statistics are used to develop the merchandise trade figures in balance of payments accounts, to appraise and analyze major movements and trends (commodity and geographic) in international trade, to plan and evaluate such programs as export expansion and agricultural development and assistance programs, and to measure the impact of tariff and trade concessions under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Generalized System of Pr eferences. Foreign trade data are also used extensively as the statistical base to implement and anal yze operations under various other international agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement. Timeliness of the foreign trade data is a major challenge. Many nations now release their monthly trade numbers before the U.S. Because of this, the Census Bureau's Foreign Trade Division has taken on the task, in conjunction with Statistics Canada and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, of exploring the possibilities of releasing the monthly trade figures earlier than the current average of 40 days after the reference month ends. This becomes even more criti cal with the President's Export Reform and the National Export Initiative. The timeliness of Census Bureau data allows for more relevant information to be available when assessing these two new programs. The Census Bureau implemented improvem ents to the programs that process transaction level foreign trade data in Fe bruary 2009 for exports and January 2010 for imports. Program code was updated to correct logic errors and improve processing efficiency, and processes were de veloped so that thousands of additional correction records could be applied to th e data each year. These changes mark a significant improvement in the quality of tr ade data released by the Census Bureau. As a result of the creation and implemen tation of these new systems, the Census Bureau is currently reviewing the current revision policy and exploring the possibility of publishing revised detail data over several years that was not functionally possible prior to these new processes. These past and future improvements to the foreign trade statis tics are planned and executed using an incremental approach so that addi tional resources are not required. Measuring Consumer Spending in the 21st Century The Consumer Expenditure (CE) survey measures consumer spending among the general population of the U.S. The primary mission of the survey is to update the relative weights of goods and services fo r the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the principal source of information concerning trends in consumer prices and inflation in the United States, and one of the Natio n's most important economic indicators. CE data also are used by a wide variety of policy analysts, government agencies, and researchers who are interested in studying the economic well-being of Americans, as well as measurable outc omes of government policies, such as increasing workers' incomes and narr owing wage and income inequality. The CE survey faces numerous challenges in the data collection environment, leading to difficulties in respondent recal l and reporting, such as: a significant increase in the number of competing surveys; less willingness on the part of households to respond to the survey; and the expansion of online shopping and 63 automatic bill paying. Furthermore, the original CE survey was designed in the late 1970s as a paper and pencil survey collected in person, and since that time, the overall design and structure of the questionnaire have remained essentially the same. The combination of these challenges has led to concerns about the accuracy of the weights used in the CPI, as well as concerns about the underestimation of survey estimates. The President's 2012 budget request for the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) proposed to modernize the CE survey. On a continuing basis, the CE survey redesign will research and incorporate multiple data collection modes to take advantage of new technologies, use new sample and statistical modeling methods to increase cost effectiveness, and assess the feasibility of implementing further improvements. Additionally, the CE survey will increase its sample size through the introduction of additional geographic areas. Updating and Augmenting the Consumer Price Index The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is the principal source of information concerning trends in consumer prices and inflation in the United States. Both the private and public sectors use this measure extens ively for economic analysis and policy formulation as well as to adjust contract values between individuals and organizations. The CPI also has a significant impact on the finances of the Federal Government because it is used to adjust pa yments to Social Secu rity recipients and to civilian and military retirees, and for a number of entitlement programs such as food stamps and school lunches. In addition, the CPI is used to adjust individual income tax brackets and other tax parameters for changes due to inflation. In FY 2012, BLS will complete the introduction of 15,000 additional rented housing units into the Rent and Owners Equivalent Rental indexes as part of the transition to a more up-to-date sample. Also, in FY 2012 BLS will begin replacing rental units that have been used in the index since 1999 to continue the transition to the more up-to-date sample design. The first of these units will be available for use in the index in November 2012. The Rent and Owner's Equivalent Rent indexes comprise almost 31 percent of the CPI. Additionally, in FY 2012 BLS proposes to increase the number of CPI commodity and services price quotes collected. BLS will identify the item areas where adding sample to the CPI will have the greatest impact in reducing the variance to the overall CPI and the other published lower level indexes. BLS also proposes to conduct research on how to improve or replace the current survey used to identify the outlets at which consumers purchase the items BLS prices in the CPI. The current survey is a telephone, random-digit dialing survey conducted by the Census Bureau. By construction, it does not include cell phones, making it increasingly out of touch with trends in phone usage, and therefore possibly underrepresenting the types of retail outlets frequented by cell-phone-only (and, on average, younger) households. The proposed research would provide the CPI with a set of potential solutions for ad dressing this issue. In FY 2012, BLS plans to begin this effort by initiating survey design and methodology research, to be completed in about two years. 64 Statistical Standards Trust in the accuracy, objectivity, and reliabili ty of Federal statistics is essential to the ongoing and increasingly complex policy and planning needs of governmental and private users of these products. These da ta must be objective and free of bias in their presentation and available to all in forms that are readily accessible and understandable. As part of an ongoing effort to improve the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information collected and disseminated by the Federal Government, OMB issues standards and guidance. Further information about OMB's statistical standards and gui dance is available below and at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg_statpolicy/. Guidance on Agency Survey and St atistical Information Collections As part of ongoing efforts to improve the quality of information collected by the Federal Government and to update statistical standards and guidance, OMB issued revised Standards and Guidelines for Stat istical Surveys, whic h provide guidance for designing, conducting, and disseminating statistical surveys and studies sponsored by Federal agencies, in 2006. The standards and guid elines are intended to ensure that such surveys and studies produce reliable data as efficiently as possible and that methods are documented and results presented in a manner that makes the data as accessible and useful as possible. To assist agencies in preparing their info rmation collection requests (ICRs) to OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, OMB has also issued guidance on agency survey and statistical information collections. This document, entitled \"Questions and Answers When Designing Surveys for In formation Collections,\" is intended for a broad audience of personnel who prepare ICRs but may not be familiar with some survey and statistical concepts. The guidance provides answers to a host of freqently asked questions about the OMB clearance process and expectations for key elements in the the design and documentation of Federal statistical surveys. Directives on the Release and Dissemination of Statistical Products Statistical Policy Directive No. 3, Compilation, Release, and Evaluation of Principal Federal Economic Indicators, most recently updated in 1985, provides for the designation of statistical series that provide timely m easures of economic activity as Principal Economic Indicators, and requires prompt but orderly release of such indicators. The intent of the directive is to: strike a balance between data timeliness and accuracy, preserve the time value of the economic indicators, prevent early access to information that may af fect financial and commodity markets, preserve the distinction between the policy-neutral release of data by statistical agencies and their interpre tation by policy officials , and provide for periodic evaluation of each indicator. To further support the quality and integrity of Federal statistical information, in 2008 OMB published Statistical Policy Directive No. 4: Release and Dissemination of Statistical Products Produced by Federal Statistical Agencies that is designed to preserve and enhance the objectivity and transparency, in fact and in perception, of the processes used to release and disseminate the Government's statistical products. Directive No. 4 covers Federal statistical products that are not covered by Statistical 65 Policy Directive No. 3, Compilation, Release, and Evaluation of Principal Federal Economic Indicators ; these include products that statistical agencies release in such areas as crime, education, health, and transportation. North American Industry Classification System The North American Industry Classifi cation System (NAICS) represents a continuing international effort by Statistics Canada; the Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica, Geograf\u00eda e Inform\u00e1tica (IN EGI) of Mexico; and the United States, through OMB's Economic Classification Policy Committee (ECPC), to foster comparability in the industrial statistics produced by the three countries. NAICS reflects, in an explicit way, the enormous changes in technology and the growth and diversification of services that have marked recent decad es. In 1997, NAICS replaced the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification; it has been adopted by Federal statistical agencies that co llect or publish data by in dustry. Like its predecessor, NAICS also is widely used by state agencies, trade as sociations, businesses, and other organizations. Statistics Canada , INEGI, and OMB have put in place a process to ensure that the implementation of NAICS is comparable across all three countries. NAICS is scheduled for review and, if necessary, update every five years, for years ending in 2 and 7. The NAICS revision for 2012 is completed and the 2012 NAICS Manual will be published by the first quarter of 2012. North American Product Classification System In recognition that a production-based indu stry classification system does not meet all of the varying needs of business data users, in 1999 OMB proposed an initiative to develop a comprehensive classification system for the products produced by North American Industry Classification System industries. Like NAICS, this initiative is a joint effort by Canada, Mexico, and the United States. The long term objective of the North American Product Classification System (NAPCS) is to develop a market-oriented/demand-based system for products that is not industry- of-origin based; can be linked to the NAICS industry structure; is consistent across the three NAICS countries; and promotes improvements in the identification and classification of products across interna tional classification systems, such as the Central Product Classification system of the United Nations. Newly developed NAPCS product definitions are scheduled to be tested in the 2012 Economic Census. Additional information regarding the NAPCS project is available at http://www.census.gov/napcs . Standard Occupational Cl assification System The Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) is a system for classifying all occupations in the economy, including private, public, and military occupations, in order to provide a means to compare occ upational data across agencies. It is designed to reflect the current occupationa l structure in the United States and to cover all occupations in which work is performed for pay or profit. OMB established the SOC Policy Committee (SOCPC) to ensure that the SOC remains relevant and meets the needs of individuals and organizations. With the implementation of the pr edecessor to the 2010 SOC, the 2000 SOC, all major occupational data sources produced by the Federal statistical system provided data that are comparable, greatly improving the usefulness of the data. The 2010 SOC 66 revision and future revisions will continue to serve this purpose, and to improve data collection and maintain currency. OMB and the SOCPC have decided that the next major review and revision of the SOC should begin in 2013, in preparation for a 2018 SOC. Given the multiple interdependent programs that rely on the SOC, this is best accomplished by timing revisions of the SOC for the year following a North American Industry Classification System revision, which will o ccur for years ending in 2 and 7. The next such year is 2018, which has the additional benefit of coinciding with the beginning year of the American Community Survey five-year set of surveys that bracket the 2020 Decennial Census. Thus, OMB intends to consider revisions of the SOC for 2018 and ever y 10 years thereafter. Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Area Definitions On December 1, 2009, OMB issued Bulletin No. 10-02 that provided an update of the statistical areas based on the Census Bu reau's population estimates for 2007 and 2008. The classification includes appr oximately 94 percent of the U.S. population\u2014about 84 percent in Metropolitan Statistical Areas and about 10 percent in Micropolitan Statistical Areas. This was the final update of the statistical areas before new areas are delineated with data from the 2010 Census. The bulletin also provides guidance to Federal agencies that use the geogr aphic delineations of these statistical areas for program administrativ e and fund allocation purposes (Bulletin No. 10-02 and related materials are available at www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg_statpolicy . OMB issued the 2010 Standards for Delineating Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas on June 28, 2010 (75 FR 37246-37252), prior to the availability of data from the 2010 Census. These 2010 standards will be applied with 2010 Census data to delineate updated statistical areas in 2013. Classification of Data on Race and Ethnicity OMB's standards for data on race and ethnicity provide a minimum set of categories for use when Federal agenci es are collecting and presenting such information for statistical, administrative , or compliance purposes. In October 1997, OMB issued revised Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity. As a follow-on to the adoption of the standards, OMB worked with its interagency committee to develop Provisional Guidance on the Implementati on of the 1997 Standards. This guidance focuses on three areas: collecting data using the 1997 standards, tabulating data collected under the 1997 standards, and building bridges to compare data collect ed under the 1997 standards and the earlier 1977. In response to requests from agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing civil rights laws, OMB developed more specific guidance for agencies that coll ect or use aggregate data on race. This guidance also addresses the allocation of mu ltiple race responses for use in civil rights monitoring and enforcement (OMB Bulletin No. 00-02, March 9, 2000, as well as the 1997 Standards and the associated Guidance, are available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg_statpolicy/ ). 67 Appendix A.

Principal Statistical Agency Staffing Levels This report historically has focused on the budgetary resources Federal agencies devote to statistical activities. To add some perspective, this appendix provides information on the staffing levels of the pr incipal statistical agencies. Each agency was asked to report its total number of staf f or appointments, as well as the number of full-time permanent staff, the number of other than fu ll-time permanent staff, and the combined number of statisticians and ma thematical statisticians. Agencies were asked to report their actual on-board strength, meaning actual positions or appointments, not their full-time equivalent (FTE) levels. This distinction is important, because one FTE can represent multiple staff positions or appointments. For example, a monthly survey may require one FTE, which could actually represent 12 positions or appointments who each worked one month. (Contractors and consultants are not Federal staff and ar e not included in the staffing counts.) Information on staffing levels in the pr incipal statistical agencies is presented below. Appendix B.

Estimated Agency Reimbursements for Statistical Activities, FY 2012 Agencies whose missions are primarily or entirely statistical often perform statistical work for others on a reimburs able basis. These reimbursements come from other agencies within the same department or from other Federal agencies, State governments, and occasionally the pr ivate sector or foreign governments. Sometimes data collected by one agency for its programmatic purposes can be used for a different programmatic purpose in an other agency. Further, some agencies have reimbursable programs but do not necessarily perform all the statistical work (for example, the Defense Manpower Data Center of the Department of Defense). Rather, they use part of the reimbursable program money to purchase statistical work from other Federal agencies. Appendix C presents a list of agencies that exp ect to perform at least $100,000 of statistical work on a reimbursable basis fo r State and local governments, the private sector, and/or other Federal agencies , ranked by the estimated size of the reimbursable program for FY 2012.
