Most of us have heard about the immune system and its necessity in the prevention of sickness as well as fighting off viruses and bacteria, but what is the immune system exactly? It is not an organ or pathway but rather a collection of various cells which act to protect the body from foreign invaders such as microbes, bacteria, particles, and toxic compounds. It is composed of two major categories of cells which are the innate immune reponse (phagocytes, NK cells, granulocytes, and physical barriers) and the adaptive immune response (T and B lymphocytes, which are produced in the bone marrow and lymphatic system). The innate immune response is the first line of defense and is a non-specific defense mechanism, which means that it does not necessarily recognize the specific foreign invader, but will just recognize that it is foreign. Once recognized, the innate response will kill or remove the invader through different mechanisms. If the invader is not removed through this mechanism, the stronger immune system (adaptive) will act to remove it by activating the T and B lymphocytes. Once activated, these cells will work to recognize the specific binding sites of the invader to produce antibodies which will disarm the invader. The adaptive immune response is often called the immunological memory, as once the body has created the necessary antibodies to fight an invader, it can easily do so again if the body is attacked by the same strain. This is also the reasoning behind vaccinations. How Do You Boost The Immune System? Boosting the immune system refers to allowing the immune system cells to readily do their job. If the body is perfectly healthy and functioning, this will be much easier. If the body is taxed by stresses, illnesses, or malnutrition, it will be harder. Thus, in Chinese medicine, the focus is not always on strengthening the immune system specifically, but rather the whole body to allow the immune system to function optimally. Since the immune system resides in the blood and lymphatic system, proper circulation of these systems is essential to good health and must be promoted. How does Traditional Chinese Medicine Boost the Immune System? First and foremost, proper diet and exercise need to be in place in order to obtain any benefits. Having successfully accomplished that, here are some amazing herbs and acupuncture/acupressure points to boost the entire body and immune system. However, the key to gaining results through the herbs is by finding the proper herb(s) to match your body or constitution. The herbs are typically not generically use but must be prescribed according to the individual. Below we will discuss which herbs should be used according to your body, but is not a substitute for seeing a Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner, who will properly address any weakened organs which may contribute to lowered immunity. Astragalus Root (Radix Astragali, Huang Qi, ) Astragalus Root is one of the best herbs to bolster the ability of your immune system to function. It works by increasing the number of active immune cells, as well as their activity. However, it primarily acts to fortify the already existing immune system and not to attack the pathogenic agents. Therefore it should only be taken while healthy and not during a cold or flu. Some of the other amazing health benefits of astragalus are its powerful anti-inflammatory effects, the ability to increase heart function and prevent heart disease, increase digestive function, improve lung function, aids the adrenals, and opens blood vessels to increase circulation. This herb would be best used for patients who have slightly weaker bodies and get sick easily, or have digestive/breathing complaints. Asian Ginseng (Chinese/Korean Ginseng, Panax Araliaceae, Ren Shen, ) There are actually over 30 different species of Ginseng, and the Asian Ginseng is the most widely known. However, do not confuse the other species (American, Siberian, Pseudoginseng) as they will yield different effects. Asian Ginseng is another great immune booster which works by increasing the effect of all the cells in the immune system, both innate and adapted. Many athletes also use Ginseng due to its effect of boosting endurance and strength, as well as the ability to boost mental capacity and alertness. Asian Ginseng also has many anti-oxidants to increase heart health and diabetes. Also, it's powerful anti-inflammatory effect helps with many inflammatory conditions. Asian Ginseng is not to be used in healthy individuals for an extended length of time, as it can cause the blood vessels to weaken spontaneous bleeding to happen. Patients who should be taking Asian Ginseng have more cold-type bodies, possibly with cold hands and feet easily, have a weaker heart, and suffer from fatigue. American Ginseng (Panax quinquefolius, Xi Yang Shen, ) The other widely used species of ginseng is the American form. Similar to the Asian form, it has a strong action of boosting the immune system by increasing the effects of all of the immune cells, both innate and adapted. Other benefits of American Ginseng are its ability to inhibit tumour growth as an anti-cancer agent, as an aid in sports enhancement, and its effect in treating diabetes. Similar to the Asian version, it is not for prolonged use. Patients suitable for using American Ginseng may have dry mouth/throat, thirsty easily, and feel weak. Acupuncture Acupuncture works by stimulating the nerves, blood, lymph, muscles, and tissue of the body to correct imbalances and retrain the body to function optimally ( [find out how acupuncture works](http://avenueacu.com/acu-faqs/)). Some of the key acupuncture points (or \"acupoints\") which increase the body's immune system also increase important processes such as digestion, mental processes, circulation, breathing, and many others. Listed below are a few important points: Stomach 36, Leg Three Miles One hand-breadth below the bottom of the kneecap, one thumb width lateral to the shin - A \"do-it-all\" point to boost immunity, digestion, energy, lungs, balance emotions blood pressure - Press and knead in a clockwise motion for at least 10 minutes per day to gain benefits Spleen 6, Three Yin Intersection One hand-width above the inner ankle bone, behind the shin - Also a \"do-it-all\" point to boost immunity, energy levels, digestion, regulate menstruation/genitals/urination, benefit the skin, increase circulation, help sleep, regulate water metabolism - Press and knead in a clockwise motion for at least 10 minutes per day to gain benefits "}
