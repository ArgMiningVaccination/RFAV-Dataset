both you and your Basic Cadet for their Acceptance into the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) ! Your Basic Cadet has chosen to serve our Nation - You have a right to be proud. Not only are they a part of your family , but now they have chosen to serve their country and join the USAFA family . We are excited to have you as a part of the USAFA fami ly! Ensure you check the Official USAFA Parents Webpage for lots of helpful information . This is where the USAFA Parent Liaison posts information and links for parents. It can be found at: https://www.usafa.edu/parents/ . Keep this link as a favorite to make it easier to find. Mailing Address: A private post office box has been assigned for Appointees ' personal mail. The box number will be available on the Appointees' Admissions portal. Use the following format for mail sent to Basic Cadets. NOTE : Basics wil l NOT have access to a ny packages until after BCT . Do NOT mail any boxes . Also the Cadet Post O ffice request no packages be sent by parents in the months of August and January since Cadet s are ordering textbooks for classes. Basic Cadet (Basic Cadet 's first and last name) (some folks put squadron) P O Box (insert Basic Cadet's P . O. Box Number) USAF Academy CO 80841 Before your Cadet arrives at the Air Force Academy As son or daughter goes through the process to become an Appointee , and once the y have been selected to attend USAFA you might have a few questions. The USAFA Admissions office counselors can help Appointees work through all the details . There is an online Admissions Portal that Appointees should visit to keep up wit h required documents, prep work and medical requirements . There is also a checklist that they must complete . There is also an Appointee G uidebook on the Admis sions P ortal as well and saved on the USAFA Parent webpage at https://www.usafa.edu/app/uploads/2023_Appointee_Booklet.pdf . Below is some information that may help keep Appointees on target. 5 Military Commitment: When Appointees arrive at the Academy, they will be asked to take the Oath of Office and sign an agreement that Appointees will fulfill the following obligations listed below: Complete the course of instruction at the Academy and serve on active duty as a commissioned officer for at least five years after graduation. Further, after entry on active duty, they may incur an additional active duty service commitment that extends beyond the minimum five year requirement stated above for those graduates who complete Rated Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) Training such as Pilot Training, Combat Systems Officer, Air Battle Manager, Remotely Piloted Aircraft, Combat Rescue Officer, Special Tactics Officer or Air Liaison Officer Training. If authorized to resign from the Air Force before the eighth anniversary of your Cadet 's graduation, he or she must serve as an officer in the Reserve Component until that eighth anniversary. Those Cadet s disenrolled prior to graduation may be required, at the option of the Secretary of the Air Force, to either serve on active duty or reimburse the United States government for the entire cost of their Academy education. Freshmen and sophomore Cadet s are ordinarily relieved from all military duty, active or reserve. The active duty commi tment varies according to the number of years the Cadet has attended the Academy. Cadet s ordered to reimburse the cost of their education incur a liability for each year of instruction. Cadet s who fail to complete their required period of active duty als o incur a liability to reimburse the United States for an appropriate portion of the cost of their Academy education. 6 Medications: All medication in your Appointee 's possession will be examined by an Air Force medical officer and will be taken away without replacement unless it is ESSENTIAL for continued treatment. Due to the nature and activities of Basic Training, possession of over -the-counter and nonessential medications (to include drugs for acne and sports supplements) is prohibited. EXCEPTION : Hormonal medication, such as birth control pills, Depo -Provera injections, or thyroid supplements; and antibi otics for ongoing infections. Medical care is available throughout BCT and medications are prescribed on an as -needed basis, to include aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol), and ibuprofen (Motrin). Routine medications, such as those for acne can be resumed at the completion of Basic T raining. Appointees must hand carry all medications (including allergy extracts) through in- processing. If you have any questions about medications, call the Cadet Clinic at 719 -333-5180. X-Rays: If an Appointee has suffered an orthopedic injury or ha s been treated for an orthopedic injury or deformity in the last year, he or she is REQUIRED to bring a current X-ray from their physician. These X -rays will be turned in to the Cadet clinic at in -processing. Medical Records: Medical re cords criteri a will differ depending on your statu s. If the Appointee is a c urrent acti ve duty member, and if their outgoing base provides them with a hard copy of their medical records, please ha nd-carry the hard copy m edica l records to the Ac ademy and tur n them i n during the medical portion of In-Processing. If the Appointee is a current military dependent, his or her m edical re cord m ust re main at t he last base where they treatment was received . They do not need to bring a copy of medical records. If the Appointee is a civilian , they do not need to bring a copy of medical records. Immuni zations: Immunizations are a m anda tory requirement for military duty. All appoi ntees m ust g et the necess ary immunizations P RIOR to arrival a t the Acade my. Waivers for imm uniza tions, i n acc ordance with DoDI 6130.0 3, W ILL NOT be accept ed. Appointees will be able to upload their immunization record on Admissions P ortal, however, we ask that Appointees also hand carry a hard copy of their immunizations records from th e physician/physician's office with them on I n-Processing day (I -Day) . If verification of immunization status is not available, Appointees will receive the comple ment of required immunizations even if immunized previously. Appointees who attended the USAFA Preparatory School and A ppointees who are former Cadet s returning to USAFA do not need to bring their shot records. 1. Polio Vaccine: Must be given six months of admission (between January and June of admission year). While we realize most appointees have had the vaccine much earlier, DOD policy requires that Appointees receive another vaccination within six months of entering military service. NOTE: If the Appointee is prior U.S. military (active, reserve, or National Guard of any U.S. military branch) they have already met the requirement. SPECIAL NOTE: Some health care providers are reluctant to administer the Polio vaccination to young men or women who received the vaccination as a child . If your provider is hesitate to do so, your Appointee can download and prescription form for the vaccination from the Admissions Portal. 7 2. Influenza Vaccine (Flu): Must be current vaccine and ha ve been administered no earlier than July 1st of last year. If Appointee can't receive influenza vaccination they will have to enter reason why on the Admissions Portal. 3. Tetanus, Diptheria, and Pertussis Vaccine (Tdap): If it has been more than 5 years since Appointees original Tdap vaccination, they must have a Tdap booster. Appointees must enter the dates received for original vaccination and Booster. 4. Mumps, Measles, Rubella Vaccine (MMR): Full vaccination requires t wo doses (at least 4 weeks apart). S PECIAL NOTE : If Appointee received both doses vaccination prior to January 1, USAFA will require a blood titers lab test to determine your immunity to Mumps. If Appointee has not been previously vaccinated , they must attempt to receive both doses before bei ng cleared to travel to USAFA. If Appointee 's first dose is after 15 May of this year, the USAFA Immunization clinic will administer the second dose during their freshman year. 5. Chicken Pox (Varicella) Vaccine (VAR): Full vaccination requires two doses (at least 4 weeks apart). S PECIAL NOTE: If Appointee s have positive blood titer value results (and can provide documentation to the fact) they do NOT need to receive the vaccine. If Appointees have not been previously vaccinated then they must attempt to receive both doses before you will be cleared to travel to USAFA. If Appointees first dose is after May 15th of this year, the USAFA Immunization clinic will administer the secon d does during their freshman year. 6. Hepatitis A & B: Appointees must be vaccinated against both Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B before In - Processing. S PECIAL NOTE: If Appointees have positive blood titer value results (and can provide documentation to that fact) Appointees do NOT need to receive associated vaccine. If Appointee has not been previously vaccinated and do not have a positive blood titers test proving immunity, then they must receive the first dose of both the HepA and HepB vaccines OR the firs t dose of the Twinrix vaccine before Appointee will be cleared to travel to USAFA. The USAFA Immunization clinic will administer the second and third doses during freshman year. Appointees must provide dates of all doses. Example: Hep -A Dose 1 & 2 dates Hep -B Dose 1, 2, & 3 Twinrix (Hep -A & Hep - B combination Dose, 1, 2, & 3 dates 7. Meningococcal ACWY Vaccine (Menomune, Menactra, Menveo): If Appointee received their first dose before the age of 16, they must receive a second dose as well. If Appointee received first dose after 16, a second dose isn't required. If Appointee received both doses before the age of 16, the doses must be the same type. Recommended Vaccinations: 8 1. Human Papillomavirus Vaccine (HPV): HPV available for series start or completion at the USAFA Immunizations Clinic. HPV is not mandatory vaccine and not be given at In- Processing. (3 Doses) 2. Meningococal B Vaccine (Bexsero or Trumenba): Bexsero requires 2 doses and Trumenba requires 3 doses. Immunization is optional but recommended. If Appointee wishes to start either series and Appointee gets first dose now , then the USAFA Immunization Clinic will administer the remaining dose(s) during their freshman year. If Appointee chooses to be immunized they may choose either series (they don't need both). Optical: Appointees can print a spectacle and contact lens prescription form from their application Admissions P ortal which must be filled out by their eye doctor and uploaded on their Admissions P ortal if they require vision correction. The form must be completed and returned no later than May 15th. If Appointees wears eyeglasses or ha s worn eyeglasses in the past two years even if they do not regularly wear them, the Appointee must bring a pair with them to the Academy and have them with them on I n-Processing D ay (I-Day) . Appointees will be issued an additional pair of uniform military spectacles on I -Day based on the prescription information that was submit ted from their eye doctor. The military specta cles given must be worn at all times during basic training. Appointees w ill need to purchase and bring a plain black eyeglass strap to secure the frames. Contact lens wear is FORBIDDEN throughout the duration of BCT to include I- Day. Contact lenses may be worn only after BCT is complete. Please direct inquiries to Optometry at 719- 333- 5189 option 4. Eyeglasses and sunglasses may have conservative ornamentation and frames may be black or brown material or gold or silver wire. Brand name glasses may be worn with a small logo on the frames or lenses. The l ogo must be the same color as frames or lenses. Conservative wrap -around sunglasses may also be worn, and c onservative, clear, slightly tinted or photosensitive lenses are aut horized. Faddish styles and mirrored lenses are prohibited. Sunglasses (to include darkened photosensitive lenses) are not authorized in formation. Dental: It is our desire to ensure that dental concerns do not interfere with Appointee s success as an Air Force Academy Cadet . Routine dental treatment as a Cadet (and while on active duty) is an entitlement and there is no cost for this dental benefit. However, in addition to having this dental benefit, ongoing dental health is a requirement for both Cadet s and active duty personnel. The Academy staff expects that Appointees to arrive at the Academy with no potentially disqualifying dental conditions. Examples of dental conditions that may prevent them from performing optimally include : (1) the pres ence of impacted or erupted wisdom teeth that cannot be maintained in a state of health ; (2) cavities that may become emergent problems if not restored immediately ; or, (3) active orthodontic appliances (braces). Active orthodontic appliances are a disqua lifying condition for Academy admission. All orthodontic treatment must be completed, devices removed, and retainers (if indicated) in place prior to entering the Academy . Permanent retainers DO NOT have to be removed. Don't forget to remind Appointees to bring their retainers with them to the Academy . Wisdom teeth may cause lost academic time and possible delays in pilot qualification for Cadet s. It is highly encouraged for Appointees to visit your family dentist for a thorough dental examination, pa ying particular attention to the above -mentioned concerns. Correction of all dental defects and removal of wisdom teeth, when indicated, before arriving at the Academy will maximize their dental health, prevent lost academic time, minimize any dental cond itions affecting pilot qualifications and go a long way toward ensuring Appointees success as an Air Force Cadet . If your civilian dentist has recommended your son or daughter have 9 their wisdom teeth removed, we strongly suggest you follow their advice. However, it would be best to have at least 8 weeks of healing between surgery and when Appointees arrives at the Academy . Upon arrival at the Academy, Appointees will undergo myriad of in -processing actions including a dental screening. There is no need for Appointees to bring their dental records or X -rays from their civilian dentist. Continuation of Medical Insur ance Coverage: We highly recommend parents contact their insurance carrier . Appointees may legally remain on their health insurance policy while they are a Cadet . During their time at the Academy, Cadet s have medical coverage under TRICARE . However, if they leave the Academy for any reason, to include disenrollment for a medical condition, the Air Force will no longer be financially responsible for any medical expenses they may incur once their identification card expires. After graduation, there will no lon ger be a need to have separate medical insurance coverage all new lieutenants will be fully covered by TriCare. Water : Ensure your Basic Cadet drink s lots of water before coming to Colorado Springs . The high altitude can be very hard on people who aren't use d to it ! Water will help keep your Basic Cadet hydrated and hopefully prevent the headaches due to altitude sickness. Ensure your Appointee is in good physical conditioning. Please see Appointee Guide for exercises to do to get ready for Cadet Basic Training. Swimmi ng Ability: Most Academy A ppointees have at least a basic swimming ability. Those who lack this skill will be placed in beginning swim classes in their second year at the Academy. Overall Fitness: Remember, a Basic Cadet 's physica l fitnes s level at entry will be a n important factor in determining their success as a Cadet . For people i n good ph ysical condition, e xercise can be an excellent tool for releasing stres s. Likew ise, for those in poor physica l conditi on, ph ysical fitness training (runnin g, push-ups, sit-ups, etc.) can add to their overall stress l evel. Pleas e don' t take the preparation lightly. Any questi ons regarding the fitness trai ning program should be a ddressed to the A thletic Department, HQ US AFA/ADPVT, 2170 ieldh ouse 9500, telephone 719- 333-2340 10 Personal Property Insurance: Occasionally, Cadet s do lose personal property. Although we don't require insurance to cover this type of loss, for your Cadet 's own protection, personal property insurance is highly recommended, especially once they enter the academic year. During the computer issue proce ss you r Cadet will have the option to choose from a limited number of vendors who provide personal property insurance for college students. Marriage and Paterni ty/Mater nity Certification: As an A ppointee , they will have to certify upon In- Processing that they are not married and have no children. Please be aware that if they do marry or become a parent as a Cadet they will be subject to disenrollment. In addition, if they marry or become a parent as a Cadet and it is not made known to Air Force authorities until after graduation, they may be subject to disciplinary administrative action as an officer. Prep School Cadet Uniforms: Preparatory School Graduates who are accepted into the Academy can bring their ABUs, boots, and leather shoes but they will also be issued all new uniforms and items. With the exception of the ABUs, Cadet uniform items are completely different from those issued at the Prep School. 11 In-Proces sing Procedures Local Hotels : USAFA can't recommend any hotels or homes for rent, but there are many hotels in the north Colorado Springs a rea readily found by a simple internet search.

Basic Cadet Training (B CT) Squadrons : The re are 8 BCT Squadrons and Appointees will be notified on their Admissions Portal on which Squadron they will be assigned to and their report time for In -Processing . Each Basic Cadet is assigned to a squadron A through H. The names and colors are listed below. Within each squadron Cadet s are divided into four flights (a, b, c, d). This is how you will identify your son/daughter during BCT, for example Executioners E flight. Ensure you get Appointee 's P.O. Box #, 17 Squadron and Flight information before tour Appointee i n-process es (Write them down or save them on your phone). The BCT squadrons are temporary, existing only for the six weeks of Basic training. The USAFA Parent Liaison will have the P.O. Box and Summer/Fall Squadron's at the Information Fair if you need them. Below is a chart to with normal Academic Squadron (SQ) assignments. USAFA tries to balance out each of the squadrons so your Basic should be flexible, but this will give you an idea.

The Cadet Wing (ie, all Cadet s at the AFA) are divided into 40 squadrons of approximately 110 Cadet s, with 25- 30 from each class. The Cadet Squadron (CS) is the basic unit in which Cadet s live and operate. Your son or daughter's Academic Year squadron is listed directly under their BC T Squadron -Flight. For example, if your son/daughter is in Cobras -D flight during BCT, he/she should be in Cadet Squadron (CS) 14 once the academic year starts. 18 Note: After their sophomore year Cadet s are assigned to a new squadron, which will become their permanent squadron for their remaining two years at USAFA.

Therefore, there i s no requirement to purchase a calculator or bring one. Some Cadet s majoring in engineering and sciences will require a more advanced \"scientific\" calculator, which can do simple linear regressions or graphing functions, but these can be purchased here if required. However, if an Appointee already own s an advanced scientific calculator, we recommend it be mailed to them after BCT, or brought during Parents' Weekend.

Mail is the only way to communicate with your Basic Cadet during this time. Mail those letters and cards often. Some Parents have send-off parties and have preaddressed cards and envelopes ready to go for friends and family. Ensure the cards don't arrive before the Appointee or the post office will return them. Cadet s won't be allowed phone calls and the letters from family and friends mean so much to them. Suggest you put your Cadet 's BCT squadron letter after their name to help get the mail to the Cadet faster. Encourage them to hang in there. It gets better, and once the BCT is over they will get laptops and have e- mail and their cell phones full time. They do normally will get their cell phones on the day of Doolie Day Out (DDO) (21 Jul 18) . Cadet s will also have time to write letters during BCT as well, and are encouraged to do so by their trainers. No Packages will be accepted during BCT . Remember when your Basic writes you, the ir spirit may be down, but it could be just that they had a rough da y. Keep encouraging them and know when you read a letter they could be just having a bad day. If you have concerns you can call the USAFA Parent Liaison. Emergency Contact Form POC: Your Cadet will fill out a form on I -Day, but if you have any questions you can all the Cadet Personnel office at 719- 333-3244.

The correct mailing address for your Cadet is crucial. Mail not deliverable due to the incorrect address or insufficient information will be returned to the sender or sent to the Dead Letter Office (if there is no return address). In addition to regular mail (envelopes) you may also send packages to the post office box (after BCT) and the Cadet s will receive a note in the boxes instructing them to pick up their packages at the counter. The address must be complete and correct. Appointees were given their P.O. Box number online with their appointment package (Note that the zip code for Cadet s is 80840.) The correct address for all Cadet s is below: John Doe PO Box xxxx (post office box number) USAFA CO 80841 -xxxx (post office box number) (If you wish, you can also put the Cadet rank (C4C, C3C, etc... before the name or as a Basic Cadet it sh ould be \"Basic Cadet John Doe\") Some parents put their Basic Cadet 's BCT squadron on the mail to get to the Basic Cadet quicker during Jack's Valley portion of BCT. The Post office puts up all mail by 4pm every day. Rememb er that during BCT each flight has training so they may not get to the post office every day , but the upper classman do try to. FEDEX, DHL, & UPS ADDRESS: The Post office will accept packages from companies that don't send to P.O. Boxes and delivery services (FEDEX, DHL, UPS etc...) AFTER BCT! You must use the post office's street address for this packages (after BCT) . Use the street ad dress of your post office and benefit from the credibility of a street address. If you sign up for this feature, we will accept delivery by private carriers (FEDEX, UPS, DHL) that do not deliver to a P.O. Box. These packages would be placed in a secure p arcel locker, if available, for your convince. Both street addressed mail and P.O. Box addressed mail can now be delivered to your P.O. Box. Suggest the family member s, friends and the Basic Cadet number their letters so there is no confusion and frustration so Basics think they are not getting mail. i.e. 1, 2, 3, etc... It is one less stress at a time that the Basics will be extremely busy and stressed with training. 22 Addresses for Private Carriers : Cadet s John Doe 2360 Vandenberg # (your P.O. Box number) USAF Academy, CO 80840 ( note different zip code than regular Cadet mail ) Prep School Street Addressing - Use the street address of: 5136 Community Center Dr. # (your P.O.

You will receive this notification only if you have mail. Signature on File . - When your Cadet arrives they will be asked to sign a signature card for the post office and the post office will keep it on file. This allows the post office to accept some signature -required mail and packages for your Cadet . This allows the Cadet s to e njoy the conveni ences of this service for products such as Express Mail. If you r Basic Cadet decides to l eave the Academy they will fill out a Form 34 (discharge) or are put on Admin Turn- back (Medical/Personal Reasons) information. During BCT Basics normally only leave due to medical issues. After BCT the Cadets can voluntarily request to be discharged. Parents please remember that if your Basic decides to leave it is their decision as the Active Duty Service Member and an adult. Parents will not be given status updates unless there is an emergency and your B asic Cadet wishes to inform you of what's going on. Contact your cadet on status updates please. Sponsor Family: All new A ppointees will be given a sponsor family. You don't need to contact anyone unless Appointees wants a particular family they are requesting. This is a really good program. It is a home away from home where your Cadet can get away from the campus and chill. Many sponsor families keep their Cadet s for their whole four (five years for Prep Schoolers) and become lifelong friends. Many are active duty or retired military and they can help your Cadet settle in and answer questions they may have. This is great for Cadet s with no military background. The families volunteer to help your Cadet and all the costs incurred are paid for by the sponsor families so try and remember them when you can. If you have a friend/family in the local area who wishes Appointees , then both the A ppointee & the sponsor family must request each other through the Cadet Sponsor office. Sponsor families must live within a 50 -mile radius of the Academy. If a sponsor family is i n the proc ess of relocating to the area, they must provide a permanent address before the Cadet Sponsor office can proceed with the application. The Preparatory School has a separate Sponsor Family. Cadet Candidates and sponsor families can email: PrepInfo@usafa.edu to request a specific sponsor. Typical Day During BCT: 1st BCT Daily Routine (29 Jun - 21 Jul 18). During 1 st, BCT cadets have a busy schedule of military training such as learning how to take orders, set up their rooms and march as a flight. Basic Cadets are awakened at 4:30 a.m. to being their day. During the day Basics take Academic placements tests, get issued items and military training until T aps and lights out a t 9:30 p.m . 2nd BCT Daily Routine (22 Jul - 1 Aug 18). During the 2nd B asic, cadets have a busy schedule of military training in a \"deployed\" location. They live in a tent city and are awakened by 5:15 a.m. Basic Cadets do different military training to include weapons training, obstacle courses and team building exercises until Taps and lights out a t 9:30 p.m . 23 Personal Time. Basic Cadets will use Personal Time for personal hygiene , to study, read and/or write letters, clean their dormitory room, seek necessary medical attention if needed , and/or prepare for the next day. Field Day: (12 Jul 19) Field Day is located on the USAFA athletic fields and parents a re welcome, but no direct contact is allowed. Field day is a competition between squadrons with different athletic sports. The competitions normally begin around 8:00 am but the North Gate does NOT open early for Field Day. The North Gate is open 9:00 - 5:00 pm daily for visitors. Sometimes parents don't even see their Cadet s so fa ir warning. Suggest bringing binoculars if you come. Doolie Day Out (DDO): (20 Jul 19) On DDO the Cadet s get to meet their spo nsor families. The sponsor families pick the Cadet s up in the morning and take them back to their ho me. This is the day your Cadet will be able to call you during BCT as they will be allowed their cell phone. Only registered sponsor families with assignment letters will be permitted to enter the pick -up area. They must have their assignment letter and dash pass. If for some reason someone makes it all the way in without these documents, the Basic will be re ported and there will be serious consequences for them upon return. Basic s will be briefed about being released only to the family they are assigned to for the day. If you are local parent you must become your Cadet 's sponsor to be allowed to pick them up on Doolie Day Out . After BCT this won't be an issue. This is to keep our Basic Cadet s safe. Parents from out -of-state should NOT come to town in hopes of spending DDO with their son/daughter on this day. Doolie Day Out is for sponsor families to get to know their sponsored Cadet s. The appropriate time for parents to come is on Acceptance Day (A Day) or Parents' Weekend (always Labor Day Weekend). They may then meet their son/daughter's sponsor families if they so desire. Parents must get the Sponsor family contact information from their Cadet . Pikes Peak or Bust Rodeo: (13 Jul 19) The Basic Cadet s take time out of their busy summer schedule to attend the Pikes Peak or Bust Rodeo in Colorado Springs. The afternoon gives your Basic a chance to relax and enjoy one of the area's oldest western heritage traditions. The Cadet s will NOT be allowed to interact with family or friends at the rodeo. Jacks Valley: This is the location of the second part of BCT. The Cadet s are sent on \"Deployment\" to a tent city where they learn combat skills, train on the obstacle course, confidence course, and assault course, and participate in team building exercises. This is a rewarding, but difficult part of BCT. 24 March to and from Jack's Valley: (21 Jul 19/31 Jul 19) If you are close , there is another chance for you to see your Cadet as they march from the Academic area to Jack's Valley and on the return march to the Academic area later on.

The March time s will be sent out through the local parent clubs when times are finalized . Please note that there will be r oad c losures affecting access to Clune Arena some come early if you can so you aren't stuck in traffic and miss the march . Parents are only allowe d to view from the sides of the road in the Eastern most parking lot of Clune Arena. Note: The Mountains are always West. Signs are welcome! You will watch your Basic march in squadron formation yelling \" Jodie's \" which are military marching songs. You w ill be able to see how excited the Basics are as they are almost done with Basic Training when they march back to the Academic area! Quite the milestone. Please note the North Gate will not open early so visitors without military IDs will have to come at 9 :00 am. Normally there will be plenty of time for parents to get in place since the road closes only as the formation gets closer to Clune Arena. Parents with military IDs are requested to show no earlier than 8:00 am in order to keep congestion down at North Gate and to give USAFA s taff time to get to work .

Unless your Cadet gives the USAF Academy specific permission to release Privacy Act information (Academic or Medical information) , USAFA staff will only be able to discuss the procedures. Your first action should always be to ask your Cadet . As the adult and active duty member the Cadet can give permission to release Academic information and not medical or vice versa, to release both, or to re strict the release of any information. They will do this as part of i n-processing, but can update later easily if they choose . You can contact their Air Officer Commander (AOC), but always start with your Cadet . During BCT however, Cadet Wing leadership requests you to call the Parent Liaison, Rose Marie Nikovits, and she will get your question answered and forward any concerns to leadership. (See below for U SAFA Parent Liaison contact information) Family Emergencies: Feel free to contact your Cadet 's AOC or AMT (enlisted superintendent) in case of family emergencies after Basic Training .

Reminder please don't send packages during Aug/Jan so students can order textbooks online and get them before class starts. 27 Daily Life at the United States Air Force Academy 28 Cadet Contact: Once the Academic year starts, d on't be surprised when you can't talk with your Cadet much or they don't get back to you quickly. They will have very limited time due to classes, studying, and military duties. They have to learn to juggle and prioritize many things, so be patient with them. When they get their email account right befor e classes start and get issued their laptop it will be easier to get ahold of them, but please remember they are super busy and their mail boxes fill up quickly so try and limit your correspondence so they can receive official emails.

Prep School P arent Weekend Registering: PW Registration is not the same for Preparatory School Cadet Candidates. You can register online to help USAFA with a count on who is coming, but most of the information sent to you may be about the Cadet s and not Prep School Candidates. The Cadet Candidates will 29 call home and see if you are coming.

You can call the Prep School at (719) 333- 2583 for more information. Printers or supplies : Many parents bring supplies etc...during P W. Please note that many squadrons view printers as a privilege and must be earned. So you may bring it, but the Cadet may have to earn the right to put it in their room. They will get issued a laptop. As soon as the USAFA Parent Liaison gets the specific laptop information she will send out and put it in the monthly family newsletter. Advise the Cadet to verify with their Air Officer Commanding (AOC) or Academy Military Trainer (AMT) for approval prior to bring ing. Every Squadron has a network printer for Cadet use by Cadets but there are many Cadet s using the printer . Typical Cadet 's Day during Academic Year: During the academic year, from early August through May, Cadet s will have a busy schedule of classes, study periods, military training, and athletic participation. They will awaken by 5:30 am in order to be at breakfast at 7:00 am. Cadet s have to rise in time to put their room in order, dress in the Cadet uniform of the day, and be on time for breakfast. After breakfast Cadets will a ttend morning classes, which begin at 7:30 am and they will attend classes or study until 11:23 am, when they will go to their squadron area for the noon meal formation. Next they will march to lunch with the Cadet Wing and have 20 minutes to eat. After lunch there are more classes or study periods in the afternoon followed by other training, athletics etc.. . Evening mealtime is from 5:00 to 7:00 pm, and academic call to quarters is at 7:50 pm. Some military activities will be required in the evening, but most of the time will be devoted to studying in their room or in the library. Cadet 's day ends with Taps and lights out at 11:00 pm. Most Cadet s find that there is not enough time during the day to complete all their assignments and fulfill all their responsibilities. They learn that time management and prioritization are two skills key to survival. The daily schedule will vary during the summer, but they will be busy throughout the day. Rooms in the two dormitories are similar. Every Cadet room has a twin size bed, dresser, and desk for each Cadet . There is a proper location for everything that is allowed to be in your Cadet 's room, and they will be expected to keep their room in perfect order. Bi-weekly \"casual\" room inspections ensure your Cadet is meeting standards while frequent (1 to 2 per month) formal room and uniform inspections are guaranteed to teach your Cadet the meaning of \"attention to detail.\" In addition to keeping their room clean they are also required to maintain a perfect uniform. You r Cadet will learn the intricacies of ironing and all the different ways to keep your shoes shined every day. 30 Weekends : Generally two weekends per month are devoted to military training (Silver Weekend s). Training is from Friday afternoon through early Saturday afternoon. Activities during this time include room and uniform inspections, parades, marching practice, military briefings, guest speakers, and professional military education and training. On non-training weekends (Blue Weekend s), Cadet s are permitted to leave the Academy if they have liberty to use. The Academy refers to liberties and authorizations as permission for Cadet s to leave the Academy during off duty periods. Individual passes on Friday evening, Saturday, and Sunday will depend on your Cadet 's class and on their overall squadron performance. Authorizations and liberties are gradually increased by class in recognition of added maturity and responsibility. Passes: If your Cadet needs to leave other than normal times or during a Silver Weekend , they can ask permission using a \"Triple S\" which is a staff summary sheet for routing purposes. This is good in case there is a wedding per say and with this approva l they can still go if the squadron gets in trouble. U.S. Air Force Birthday Ball (date TBD in September ): This is a mandatory event for Doolies (C4Cs) held each September to celebrate the Air Force's Birthday on 19Sep and they can invite a guest (normally girlfriend/boyfriends) . Cadet s must w ear service dress. For guests suggest a nice party dress or gents a suit, dress shoes, and tie. This is not a casual dance, be c onservative.

For example, last year for the class of 202 1 the monthly deduction was $28.84 for Dry Cleaning and $58.53 for laundry service. ( The budget isn't out yet for 2018- 2019 Academic Year yet). 2021 Cadet s have been complaining that they don't like the service that Goodwill (the contractor) is providing and are asking for 10th Force Support Squa dron (10 FSS) gift certificates to do their Laundry . Cadet Wing policy is that f our degrees are not to use 10 FSS laundromat without their element leader or higher approval. Cadet Wing Support Division would like the Cadet s to come to them if the Cadet is having issues with the contracted laundry service as the customer service reps. If the Cadet s are approved, then parents can call the 10 FSS Laundromat and purchase gift certificates for $8.00 per 10 pounds at (719) 333- 4563 or 2615 to pay by credit card or the Cadet can come in and pay. The folks at the Lau ndromat keep the certificates by squadron or the Cadet can take the certificate. If the certificate is lost however , then the Cadet is out. Either way the money will still be taken out of the C4Cs pay monthly. Leave (vacation): Cadet s will receive approximately five days of leave each Thanksgiving, two weeks at Christmas, one week during the Spring Break , and two to three weeks of summer break (after your first year), based on the training programs you will be taking. Please note that if you are deficient in academics or athletics you may be directed to participate in specific programs in lieu of summer leave. Cadet s must pay their own transportation costs during these breaks. The 10th Force Support Squadron does provide a shuttle bus service for a cost to the Colorado Springs and Denver airports during the breaks (not including Summer Break). 31 Thanksgiving/Winter Break/Spring Break Procedures (normally): Shuttle Info will be sent out through Parent Clubs when released and posted on the USAFA Webpage .

It happens a lot so keep this in mind when deciding on whether or not to use the shuttle service. 32 NOTE: For summer break there are NO shuttle rides provided by 10 FSS. Cadet s are on their own to get to airports. Please don't wait to purchase shuttle bus tickets once Cadet Outdoor Recreation is accepting reservations.
