Tara Mattes L.Ac Tara graduated from the University of Colorado at Boulder with a BA in religious studiesand a minor in biology. Upon graduation she worked as a photographer's assistant and it was during her travels in Asia that she was first introduced to meditation, acupuncture, and herbal medicine. In 2002 she moved to Honolulu, Hawaii to study under Taoist master, Shihfu Lillian Chang Y Hsiang, at the Tai Hsuan Institute. During her time at Tai Hsuan she focused on women's health and pediatrics and became a certified birth doula. She has been a licensed acupuncturist (certified by the state of Hawaii and nationally through NCCAOM) since 2008. She immediately joined Sacred Healing Arts, founded by Dr. Lori Kimata Naturopathic midwife and OB/GYN. As an acupuncturist and doula, she attended numerous births and assisted women with fertility issues, pregnancy and postpartum care. In 2010 she also joined Manakai O Malama Integrative Medical Practice part time as an acupuncturist for pain management. This high paced setting gave her an opportunity to see thousands of patients and work collaboratively with other medical professionals in an integrative setting. Inspired to help acute and chronic pain patients, she began studying under Master Richard Teh Fu Tan, whose technique known as the balance method, has profound and immediate effects. After a couple years away pursuing a solo practice she recently rejoined Sacred Healing Arts and is actively treating clients, specializing in fertility, pre and postpartum care, pain management, and well being. Residing in Hawaii for many years now, she continues to live in awe and gratitude for nature, its people, and the aloha spirit. She is thankful for all her teachers manifest in its many forms and continues to enjoy learning and connecting with those around her. When not at her practice, she is dancing, hiking, cooking and adventuring with family and friends. "}
