The word 'malaria' has been derived from the Italian word 'mala aria', which means bad air, as it was once believed to be caused by bad air. But medically, malaria is an infectious disease caused by a protozoani [X]Protozoa are a group of single-celled microorganisms that are either free-living or parasitic in nature and feed on organic matter. parasite. The female Anopheles mosquito acts a carrier for this parasite. The female Anopheles mosquitoes are found breeding in stagnant waters, from where they can contract the parasite and spread it to humans. When this [mosquito bites](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/effective-home-remedies-for-bug-bites/) a person, the parasite enters his/her body and initially grows in the liver for a few days. It then enters the bloodstream and attacks the red blood cells. This is when the various symptoms of malaria start to present themselves. A warm climate is a convenient breeding environment for the parasite and the mosquito. Hence, people living in the tropical regions are more susceptible to this disease ( [1](https://medlineplus.gov/malaria.html), [2](https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/index.html)). Here are some fast facts about malaria. Malaria Facts - People living in 106 countries and territories across the world i.e. more than three billion people are at a risk of malaria. - In the United States, malaria was eliminated in the 1950s. However, almost 2000 cases are reported every year, mostly by people who have recently traveled to a tropical country. - Three different species of the Anopheles mosquito have been found to be responsible for spreading the infection. - When a pregnant woman contracts the infection, it can result in a decreased birth weight of the baby, reducing the chance of its survival. - Multiple diagnostic tools used by an experienced laboratory technician or pathologist can help differentiate the type of parasite causing the infection so that the appropriate treatment can be planned by the doctor. Let us now look at the root cause of this disease. What Causes Malaria? Malaria is caused by the protozoan parasite called Plasmodium. Five species of this parasite have been recognized so far that infect humans. These are: - Plasmodium falciparum - predominant in Africa - Plasmodium vivax - predominant in Asia, Latin America, and a few regions in Africa - Plasmodium ovale - predominant in West Africa and western Pacific - Plasmodium malariae - predominant worldwide - Plasmodium knowlesi - predominant in Southeast Asia ( [3](https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/biology/parasites.html)) Find below the different types of malaria and its symptoms. Types Of Malaria And Its Symptoms Based on the severity of the infection, there are two types of malaria - uncomplicated and severe (or complicated). (a) Uncomplicated Malaria - The malarial fever attack consists of the cold stage (shivering and chills), the hot stage (fever), and the sweating stage (sweating and tiredness). Typically, an attack lasts for 6-10 hours and repeats on the second day when the infection is caused by these parasites - P.falciparum, P.vivax, and P.ovale. These are referred to as 'tertian' parasites. The P.malariae is called as a 'quartan' parasite, and the malarial attack repeats every third day during this type of infection. Symptoms of this type of malaria include: - Fever - Chills - Sweats - Headache - Nausea and vomiting - Tiredness - Body pains - Joint pain - Loss of appetite - Confusion - Diarrhea (4, 5) (b) Severe Malaria - This is when the infection has spread to various organs and is causing organ failure and more serious symptoms. These manifestations are: - Cerebral malaria - seizures, coma, and other neurological abnormalities [Severe anemia](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/effective-home-remedies-to-cure-anemia/) - Hemoglobinuriai [X]A condition where a rise in hemoglobin in the blood leads to the appearance of hemoglobin in the urine. - Abnormalities in the blood coagulation process - Respiratory conditions, such as ARDS - Kidney failure - Hypoglycemiai [X]A condition characterized by lowered blood sugar levels in the body. Symptoms include heart palpitations, anxiety, and confusion. [Low blood pressure](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/effective-home-remedies-for-low-blood-pressure/) - Metabolic acidosis Immediate treatment is essential for severe malaria ( [4](https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/disease.html)).

Frequently Asked Questions Is malaria a virus? Malaria is a disease caused by a parasite called Plasmodium. It is a single-celled organism, which is not a type of virus. What is the incubation period of malaria? The incubation period is slightly different, depending on the type of parasite that is causing malaria. For P. falciparum, the incubation period is 9-14 days. For P.ovale and P. Vivax, it is 12-18 days, and for P. malariae, it is 1840 days. Which organs are affected by malaria? During the initial stages, the parasite affects the red blood cells only, but as the disease progresses, it starts to affect the liver and the spleen. In extreme cases, it can affect the brain and cause cerebral malaria. How does malaria affect the human body? The parasite initially lies dormant in the red blood cells of the blood. After this dormant stage, it starts to multiply and feed on the contents of the red blood cells. Every 48-72 hours, the cell bursts to release more parasites into the bloodstream. This is the time that is referred to as a malarial attack when a person experiences the symptoms. Fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, headache, tiredness, and body pain are commonly experienced. Can malaria cause joint pain? Yes, it can cause joint pain. Can malaria cause miscarriage in pregnant women? Malaria and its symptoms can be more pronounced in a pregnant woman. Miscarriage is very rarely caused during the initial stages as treatment options are available that are safe to be used during pregnancy. As the malaria progresses, the chances of it causing miscarriage increase. Is malaria contagious? Malaria does not spread from person to person. If the Anopheles mosquito bites an infected person, the parasite can be transferred to a healthy person by that mosquito's bite. How long does it take to recover from malaria? Generally, for malaria, recovery takes about two weeks. How long does it take to die from malaria? Death due to malaria is highly subjective. It depends on the current condition of the patient, which type of Plasmodium is responsible for the infection, and if any treatment is being taken or not. There is no specific timeline. However, if left untreated, malaria can easily progress to anemia, hypoglycemia, and cerebral malaria. This can eventually lead to coma and death. How long is a malaria vaccine good for? The vaccine is still under testing. Hence, there is no information about the duration it will be effective for. Malaria diet: What to eat and avoid? Diet plays a crucial role in the speedy treatment of malaria. After the malarial fever has subsided, it is advisable to maintain an exclusive fresh fruit diet along with milk for the first few days. Thereafter, the patient should follow a balanced diet consisting of fresh fruits and raw vegetables. - Develop the habit of having a light diet without using much oil or butter. - Oily, spicy, and junk foods can only make the situation worse. - Fruits like apples, bananas, grapes, and guava help in quick recovery from malaria. - You can also try juice made from papaya leaves as it is said to have antimalarial properties ( [24](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233778301_Antimalarial_activity_of_Carica_papaya_Family_Caricaceae_leaf_extract_against_Plasmodium_falciparum)). - In case of high fever, extract some fresh lemon juice and add it to a cup of lukewarm water. The patient should slowly sip this lemon water. This will prevent the rise in temperature during the initial period of fever. Though it is a serious disease, malaria can be cured if diagnosed at the right time and with the right medication. If you suspect malaria, immediately consult a doctor. Use the remedies given in this article to get relief from the symptoms of this disease while the medicines do their work. Preventive measures work best when you do not want to face the consequences of this infection. So, keep those in mind for sure, especially if you are in a high risk area. Wishing you (or the patient) a quick recovery! Take care! Key Takeaways - Malaria treatment involves conventional plants like neem, tulsi, and ginger. - Using organic supplements such as papaya, garlic, and vitamin C can improve malaria conditions. - Adopting lifestyle modifications such as drinking enough water, avoiding insect bites, and eating healthily can also work wonders. - Use essential oils in massage therapy and aromatherapy to treat malaria.
