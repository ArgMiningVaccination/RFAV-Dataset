My daughter is going to have surgery, are there any remedies that can be used to speed up healing? Homeopathic medicines can be used for healing from surgery as well as from the anesthesia. In the United States there are over 7 million procedures and surgeries performed each year. According to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery some plastic surgeons are beginning to advocate the use of the homeopathic remedy, Arnica montana, to decrease postoperative bruising and swelling. Surgical procedures can be traumatic to the body. The following list represents some of the commonly used homeopathic remedies for post-operative healing. It is best to have the chosen remedy (ies) on hand before so they can be used immediately following the procedure. Dosing Example: Arnica 30C (or a higher dose, i.e. 200C)- 3 tablets to be taken 4 times a day after surgery for several days. With improvement decrease to 1-2 times a day then discontinue. Major surgery may require the remedy be used for several days. Choose the remedy on the symptoms. Change the remedy as the person's symptoms change. With improvement, the remedy should be used less often. Remedies can be used in conjunction with other medications. For any worsening symptoms always contact your doctor immediately. "}
