I know a lot of us are really spooked by the dreaded Chemo, but for HER2+ Grade 3's it really does seem like a life saver, so I am going to go for it. But OH the side effects daunt me (I am a single parent of an 11 year old and am not keen on him seeing me in that state or becoming my carer) Plus I am self employed so HAVE to keep working at some level (luckily I can work from home via email and web conferences so can sit in my pyjamas with a pineapple lolly in one hand and a bucket in the other !) HOWEVER, I have been looking into complimentary/ natural therapies. My close friend went through BC with mastectomy and chemo last year... she swears by white Mistletoe Extract therapy (she originally wanted total Naturopath treatment but thankfully was persuaded to have Mastectomy and chemo, with this as a complimentary therapy.) Have any of you had this? Would be great to hear from anyone who has to see if you also rave about it. I know it is not yet common in UK but it sounds like it should be. (I think you can get it on NHS even, but it seems to be a bit of a well kept secret! (not easy to google for info on it! I ended up on German sites) My advice to all you ladies like me who are about to see your oncologist to ask about options/ pros/cons for getting Misteltoe extracts into your plan as a complimentary therapy Mistletoe appears to be natural way to get through a load of the side effects of the treatments.(Mother Nature eh? She gives us cancer but grows a plant that'll help!) Seems like UK are lagging in complimentary therapy arena. Germany seem to be pretty much leading the way regards cancer these days, approx 60% of cancer patients there are treated with it, France catching up with 40%, UK finally getting on board, but you may have to fight for it! Contra-indications: Not actually many contraindications, some allergies (reddening of the skin), but here is the list I can find: Findings from a 30 Year Study (Misteltoe has been used since 1920s in Germany! Whay are we only hearing about it now??): \". NB: This is NOT an advert, I really think we need to learn about alternative therapies to help us have the best experience, and make better informed choices. I'd love to hear from anyone who has had Mistletoe extract! Is it as "}
