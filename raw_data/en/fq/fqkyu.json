However, many diseases still exist without a vaccine. To create vaccines for these diseases we need to understand and create enhanced responses that enable proper immune activation. This organized activation can be achieved using adjuvants, components added to the vaccine to enhance the immune respon se. Typically, vaccines have been empirically derived, leading to expensive and lengthy development periods. Our lab is focused on creating tools to enable rational and optimized vaccine design. My work focuses on two main areas: creating tools to probe im mune responses on the single -cell level, leading to a greater understanding of immune activation and applying this understanding to create more effective vaccines to challenging diseases. One of the biggest challenges of creating new vaccines is attaining an adequate safety profile. Many vaccines can provide protection but do not translate to the clinic due to the high levels of inflammation they induce. CpG, a synthetic bacterial DNA mimic, has demonstrated great promise as an adjuvant, however most vacci nes that include CpG do not make it through clinical trials. Using an NF -B inhibitor, we demonstrate that we can enhance the safety and protection afforded by CpG and many other common adjuvants. Many of the most effective vaccines stimulate multiple innate immune pathways. When this combination of pathways leads to enhanceme nt of the immune response this is known as an immune synergy . Although the existence of immune synergies is well understood, the mechanism of enhanced activity is still unknown. Few tools exist to directly examine spatial and temporal elements of immune ac tivation and synergies . Described here are two tools to elucidate xv the spatiotemporal aspects of innate immune responses . The first is a particle -based system allowing effective agonist presentation and tracking of activated cells. The second is an optogene tic innate immune receptor allowing the receptor to be activated with the spatial and temporal precision of light. 1 1 Introduction 1.1 Introduction Vaccines are one of the most effective forms of disease prevention available to humans and animals providing extended survival and improved quality of life.1 Vaccines educate the immune system to recognize target pathogens without ever being at risk for the disease.2,3 To date, effective vaccines have been designed empirically, usually relying on inactivated or attenuated forms of the pathogen.4-7 This approach has enabled several successful vaccines, leading to the eradication of small pox and near eradication of polio.8 Although this approach is successful for a handful of diseases, it presents challe nges for others.9,10 Some weakened or inactivated pathogen s are not immunogenic enough on their own to produce a robust and life - long immune response and therefore do not lead to protection.11 Additionally, the amount of pathogen needed, storage conditions and side effects are all important factors tha t could cause a vaccine to fail during clinical trials, leaving the public without protection.3,12-16 Overcoming these challenges requires a deep understanding of the mechanistic framework that underlies the immune respons e and unique, adaptable and scalable tools to effectively tune the protective nature of the vaccine. By exploring the mechanisms by which the immune system is ultimately governed and applying that knowledge to vaccine formulation, we hope to improve vacc ine efficacy and safety and widen the scope of diseases that can be prevented by prophylaxis. By utilizing tools from optogenetics, we can build immune receptors from the ground up, enabling precise spatiotemporal precision over activation. Employing singl e-cell technology will provide key insights into immune activation. Lastly, analyzing key pathways involved in immune activation and modulating them accordingly will lead to breakthroughs in vaccine technology. 2 1.2 The Innate and Adaptive Immune System The immune system has two branches, the innate immune system that acts quickly and non-specifically and the adaptive immune system that takes time to develop, but is specific to a particular pathogen . 7 Both responses are important in fighting disease and are intrinsically linked through feedback mechanisms. In r esponse to infection, innate immune cells which express pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on the invader and are the first to respond, sending out chemical signals such as cytokines and chemokines to the surrounding environment.17 Antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells infiltrate the area, become activated by PAMPs and begin engulfing pathogens and cellular debris and processing them for express ion on the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) for display on the cell surface.7 This surface presentation si gnifies what antigens the cell has encountered. This surface presentation is the link between the innate and adaptive immune system and is incredibly important for creating successful vaccines. After activation, the APCs express other surface receptors imp ortant for costimulation, such as CD40 and CD86. This key step of activating the APC is an important link between the innate and adaptive immune system. The APCs then travel to the lymphnode where eventually they will encounter a T cell with a T cell rece ptor (TCR) that recognizes the MHC -peptide complex on the APC . 7 Additionally, the costimulatory molecules on the APC are recognized by the T cell and signal to the T cell to expand, creating more T cells expressing the same TCR. This expanding T cell population is created to increase the probability of discovering a B cell that has engulfed antigen and is presenting the same MHC -peptide as the APC that originally activated the T cell. Upon activation by the T cell, the B cell with proliferate and differentiate into memory B cell and 3 plasma B cells. Memory B cells remain in circulation and provide a memory response to a particular pathogen. Plasma B cells produce antibodies. 1.3 Effect of PRR activation There are several subclasses of pattern recognition receptors such as retinoic acid - (RIG) receptors, C -binding oligomerizati and toll like receptors (TLRs).18 TLRs are the most well -characterized PRRs. TLRs are an actively being explored as vaccine adjuvants because this class of receptors natively recognizes the most common pathogen associated molecular patterns present on bacteria viruses, etc. Responses of PRRs to PAMPs lead to strong and effecti ve immune responses. There are ten types of TLRs in humans that recognize different classes of PAMPs. TLRs contain a horseshoe -shaped motif comprising of several leucine -rich repeat units (LRRs). Two TLRs come together around LRRs to form a constitutive di mer. TLR dimers can be homodimers between two of the same TLR or TLR heterodimers where two different TLR types come together. TLRs can signal either from the cell surface or from the endosome. TLRs that signal from the cell surface include: TLR 1, 2, 4, 5 , and 6. These receptors activate in response to molecules located on the surface on pathogens. TLRs that activate in the endosome are TLR3, 7, 8, and 9. These TLRs recognize molecules that are located within a pathogen such as RNA or DNA. In response to PRR activation transcription factors such as NF -B and IR3 are activated priming the transcription of a variety of cytokines, chemokines and cell surface receptors. Downstream responses to PRRs such as TLRs lead to lasting immunity. 4 1.4 Importance of NF -B in innate and adaptive immune activation NF-B is a transcription factor that resides in every single cell in the human body, at all times.19 This transcription factor remains in the cytoplasm until intracellular signaling pathways uncover it's nuclear localization sequence enabling it to migrate to the nucleus where it can prim e the transcription of more than 400 immune genes.20 This process begins with activation of a receptor, either a PRR such as a TLR or a cytokine receptor.21 The downstream transcription is tailored to the particular type of receptor activ ation. NF -B accomplishes this variety of gene profiles through subunit diversity.19 NF-B is a family of transcription factors made up of two subunits - a DNA binding domain and a transcriptional activator domain. Together these subunits form a dimer that can both bind specific DNA sequences, called promoters, and can activate transcription. Each DN A binding domain has a unique affinity for a particular promoter leading to select gene transcription in response to specific subunit activation. Each transcriptional activator has different affinities for other transcription factors leading to large compl exes that either upregulate or downregulate transcription. Additionally, dimers can form between DNA binding domain subunits, leading to promoter binding, but not transcription \u2014essentially blocking transcription of specific genes. The variety of subunits a nd their functions leads to diversity in the results gene profile and immune response. As NF -B is a master regulator of a significant number of immune genes, the immune system has evolved to balance the expression of immune genes. Although the work has be en pursued to identify the significance of each subunit, more studies need to be conducted to fully elucidate the functions of each subunit and how they work together. 5 1.5 History of vaccines Throughout history vaccines have taken a variety of forms beginning with smallpox inoculation. As early as 430 BC it was identified that those who had survived smallpox did not contract the disease again and survivors were called upon to nurse the ill. From this it became clear that our bodies have complex mechanisms that enable us to remember past infections.22 This understanding led to the innovation of the first \"vaccine\" where a small amount of material from a smallpox pustule was transferred from a patient with the di sease to a non -immune patient, this process was termed inoculation. The material was scratched into the skin with the hope that a mild, but still protective infection would result. Typically, patients would develop a less severe infection than naturally ac quired smallpox, however after inoculation the illness would last weeks to months.22 The second generation of a vaccine came in the 1700s from Edward Jenner. Jenner noticed that milkmaids who had previously been ill with cowpox, did not show symptoms upon infection with smallpox. This interesting connection led to an improvement in the inoculation procedure. Instead of inoculating with smallpox, Jenner inoculated with cowpox, a much less severe disease.22 From this we learned that some less harmful diseases could protect against more severe and devastating diseases. This eventually led to the idea that pathogens could attenuated by adapting them in other species making them less infectious to humans. Albert Sabin used a rodent -adapted polio virus to use as a vaccine against polio. Later, it was discovered my Jonas Salk that inactivating the virus by chemical means could lead to long - lasting immunity while enhancing the safety of the vaccine .23,24 These instances paved the way for empirical design of many modern vaccines. 6 1.6 Vaccine Types There are four main categorie s of vaccines recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO): Live attenuated, inactivated, toxoid and subunit vaccines.7,25 Each vaccine types has found use against select path ogens delivering safe and effective protection form disease. Live attenuated vaccines are vaccines that uses a weakened form of a live virus. The attenuation is achieved by passage through a foreign host.6,25,26 This can be done in vitro using tissue culture, or in vivo through embryonated eggs or live animals. 6,25,26 The foreign host acts as a selection for host -optimized virus, eventually becoming so optimized for the host that it is not infectious to humans. The attenuation process makes it easier for the human immune system to eliminate, but keeps necessary components for effective immune response. Vaccines of this type are advantageous because they activate all phases of the immune system. Because the intact virus is administered, it contains PAMPs that are recognized by the innate and adaptive immune systems. The virus will replicate very slowly enabling typical host -pathogen interactions and adaptations, leading to a ro bust innate and adaptive immune response.7,25 These vaccines are generally low cost because they contain only the virus and no additional manufactured components are required. The potential for the virus to mutate back to the infectious variant is a disadvantage of this vaccine especially for immunocompromised patients.27 Typically, immunocompromised individuals are cautioned not to receive vaccines of this type causing them to rely on herd immunity for protection. These vaccines need to be stored at prop er environments for the virus to remain viable which can sometimes present problems in shipping and maintenance of vaccine lots.15,28 Vaccines of this type currently administered in the clinic are: tuberculosis, measles vaccine, yellow fever and the live -attenuated vaccine for seasonal influenza. 7 Inactivated vaccines consist of a virus, bacteria or other pathogen that have been rendered inactivated using a method such as heat or formaldehyde.25 This inactivation leads to a non - infectious pathogen that can safely be used in vaccination. This is advantageous for immune compromised patients because they can safely be vaccinated without fear of infection. This type of vaccine often requires booster vaccines because the inactivation process interferes with full establishment of immunity. Pertussis and the most commonly used seasonal flu vaccine are inactivated vaccines. Toxoid vaccines are another class with inactivated components. The toxin produced by the pathogen is inactivated by heat or formaldehyde. In this case, immunity is being formed to t he toxin produced by the pathogen, rather than to the pathogen itself. Tetanus and diphtheria are an example of this type of vaccine. Subunit vaccines consist of one of (or subset of) the proteins or sugars responsible for infection. This antigen can eit her be expressed in a different virus or bacteria creating a recombinant pathogen or the components for this vaccine are expressed and purified enabling more intentional and repeatable dosage. This type of vaccine is favorable due to the increased control over purity, dosage and reproducibility in antibody formation. Each subunit consists of a particular antigen that is important to providing immunity. By controlling which subunits and the amount of each subunit is in the vaccine, the resulting immunity is more reproducible. Typically, these vaccines are more shelf -stable enabling efficacy to be maintained in a variety environmental conditions. Current clinal vaccines of this type include hepatits B, some seasonal flu vaccines, and pneumonia vaccine. Th e subunits typically are not immunogenic enough on their own, so adjuvants are added to increase the immune response. 8 1.7 Vaccine adjuvant types and discovery Adjuvants are components added to vaccines to increase the immune response, leading to protection. Adjuvants are required when vaccine formulations are not immunogenic enough to elicit protection.29 Ideally adjuvants are stable with a long shelf life, biodegradable or easy to metabolize, inexpensive to produ ce on large scales, do not induce immune responses to themselves and promote the desired cellular or humoral immune response against the antigen of interest. 29,30 Currently, very few adjuvants are approved for use in humans in the United States.31 The most common adjuv ant is aluminum formulated as amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate (AAHS), aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate or potassium aluminum sulfate (Alum). The adjuvanting power of aluminum salts was discovered in 1920 when it was observed that variatio ns in batches led to significant changes in the effectiveness of the vaccines. This variability was determined to be due to contamination of the reaction vessels, where \"dirty\" vessels demonstrated and increased effectiveness. From then on a variety of sal ts and substances were combined with vaccines to assess how effectively they boost the immune response. Although many substances boosted immune responses, for decades alum was the only adjuvant approved for use in humans. In the last decade, a few other a djuvants have been approved for use in humans in the United States.31 MF59 is an oil -in-water emulsion composed of squalene. This adjuvant improves immune cell infiltration and aids in transport of antigen to the l ymphnode, improving presentation to adaptive immune cells.32 Other adjuvants use synthetic PAMP -like der ivatives that TLRs. AS04 which (MPLA) combined with alum.33 MPLA activates TLR4 leading to improved immune response.34 AS01B consists 9 of MPLA and QS -21, a natural compound found in the tree Quillaja Saponaria. The mechanism of QS -21 has not yet been fully elucidated but membrane lysis has been noted to be involved.35 Lastly, CpG ODN 1018 has been approved for use in a single vaccination, Heplisav -B.36 CpG is a synth etic DNA mimic consisting of cytosine phosphoguanine that mimics bacterial genetic material.37 While these approved a djuvants have enabled protection against a variety of diseases, many diseases cannot be prevented with current vaccine technologies and therefore new and improved adjuvants need to be created. 1.8 Strategies and progress for adjuvant development The need to develop new vaccines for diseases that continue to threaten public health, such as HIV and malaria, as well as emerging diseases, like Ebola and Zika virus still exists. However, most vaccines are empirically derived, with little understanding of their mechanism of action. This lack of understanding makes it difficult to rationally and rapidly develop new vaccines toward prevalent diseases. The effectiveness of a vaccine is influenced by its composition , where vaccines are composed of an antige n and an adjuvant.38 Treatment with antigens alone can suffer from low immunogenicity, so an adjuvant is required to enhance the immune response toward the antigen of interest 39. Adjuvants are typically formulated using a single immune agonist, aluminum salts, and/or in an oil -in-water emulsion. Recently, developing adjuvants that are composed of multiple types of immune agonists has shown promise. This strategy aims to elicit an enhanced immune response, known as an \"immune synergy,\" potentially providing a more effective vacci ne 40,41. Here, we provide an overview of immune synergies present in pathogens and successful synergistic combinations used in the clinic. The techniques and topics discussed here can provide future direction and guidance toward advancing synergistic adjuvant and vaccine development. 10 1.9 Current State of Vaccine Adjuvants Adjuvants greatly influence the activation and direction of immune signaling pathways and the body's protective r esponse toward infection 39,42. Therefore, choosing the appropriate adjuvant is crucial to vaccine efficacy. Alum has been used to adjuvant clinica l vaccines for almost a century 42, followed by oil -in-water emulsions (complete Freund's adjuvant 39, MF59 -Novartis 43, and AS03 44) and and adjuvant, have been successful in enhancing the i mmune response, but these adjuvants also result in unwanted systemic and local side effects. 16,46 Since there are few FDA approved adjuvants (e.g. Alum, MPLA - Monophosphoryl Lipid A, CpG -ODN ) (Table 1) 47,48, there is a greater interest in developing new adjuvants with improved safety profile s that elicit targeted immune responses 49-51. 11 Table 1. 1 Adjuvants Used in FDA A mimetic) B 45 Al(OH) 3 Outer Membrane (TLR9 oligonucleotide agonist) Hepatitis B 47f 12 With the need for new adjuvants that generate a specific immune response, PAMP s are being utilized as adjuvants to activate specific PRRs and increase immunogenicity without systemic toxicity. PAMPs inherently activate the immune system in an effective manner ( Fig. 1.1). This natural efficacy has led to the utilization of native or synthetically optimized PAMP derivatives as adjuvants in vaccines to enhance and elicit specific immune responses against co -administered antigens 45. TLR agonists are at the forefront of adjuvant de velopment because TLRs are well characterized and their administration can elicit a strong cellular T H1 response, which many vaccines lack. 39,45 Additional classes of PAMPs, such as nucleotide -bindin g oligomerization domain (NOD/NLR), stimulator of interferon genes (STING), retinoic acid -inducible gene I (RIG - I), and C -type lectin (CLR) agonists, are also starting to be employed as potential adjuvants. 52,53 Targeting specific PRRs from different classes provides a wide range of immune responses because each receptor activates a distinct signaling pathway, thereby influ encing innate and subsequent adaptive immune responses to produce defined cellular and antibody responses. 54,55 13 Figure 1. 1 Overview of Innate and Adaptive Immune Activation by a Pathogen. Immunotherapies, including vaccines, eliminate and prevent infection by activating the host immune system against a target pathogen. Effective vaccines stimulate the innate immune system, the rapid response of the body to pathogens, which subsequently interacts with the adaptive immune system to provide a long -term response. The innate immune system is comprised of APCs, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, which express PRRs. PRRs are activated by immunostimulatory molecules (PAMPs) such as ssDNA, lipoproteins, and small molecules that are present in native pathogens. The innate immune system evolved to sense defined sets of pathogen -associated molecules that are potential molecular codes. Each specific code or combination of molecules corresponds to a specific pathogen and elicits a defined immune response (i.e., distinct cytokine production and antigen presentation). The specificity of pathogen recognition and the ability to sense multipl e PAMPs are intrinsic to the defense and homeostasis -maintaining mechanisms of the immune system. These immune agonists not only control the initial innate immune response but also influence the downstream adaptive immune response to a target antigen. The adaptive immune response includes cellular (TH1) and antibody (TH2) responses, by T and B cells, respectively. Both cellular and antibody responses are necessary to provide an effective and prolonged immune response against pathogens. Abbreviations: ssDNA, single -stranded DNA; TH1/2/17, type 1/2/17 T helper cell. Many adjuvant formulations consist of a single type of PAMP. Unfortunately, a single immune agonist is not always as effective as a whole pathogen at eliciting an efficacious immune response. Natu ral pathogens, such as Neisseria meningitidis and the yellow fever virus, contain more than one type of PAMP ( Table 1.2) 56-83. Due to this innate efficacy, there has been greater use of multiple ligands to synergistically enhance the immune response. These improved responses can provide reduced adjuvant and antigen dosing, also known as \"dose sparing\" 40,41. In addition, response amplification through immune synergies aids in differentiating foreign antigens from self-antigens, thus working to prevent autoimmune responses. Immune synergies can also dictat e 14 the type of response generated, which depends on the specific combination of PRRs targeted, ensuring that the protective immune responses produced are tailored to the pathogen of interest. 84,85 The use of multiple classes of PAMPs as adjuvants in clinical models has demonstrated positive vaccination result s, suggesting considerable potential for these molecules as new adjuvants . 15 Table 1.2 Natural Pathogens that Activate Multiple PRRs. 1.10 Technologies for Synergistic Adjuvant Development Recent discoveries have prompted collaboration between different scientific disciplines, leading to the development of new methods to improve the adjuvanticity of native and synthetic PRR agonists as well as the delivery of synergistic adjuvants. Innovative chemical, biological, and Disease/Pathogen PRRs TLR2, TLR4, TLR9 16 engineering methods are being utilized to rapidly screen and analyze synergistic immune responses for adjuvant discovery, determine dosing, localize delivery of multi -agonist a djuvants, and deliver vaccine cargo to specific immune cell subtypes and cellular compartments. We will touch on each of these points with regards to adjuvant discovery and vaccine development. 1.10 High Throughput Screening of Immune Agonist Synergies f or Adjuvant Discovery High throughput screening (HTS) has recently been utilized as a method to analyze multiple cytokines when screening different immune synergy combinations and choosing the best adjuvant for a vaccine 84,86. HTS is widely used in drug discovery to rapidly screen compound libraries for biologically active molecules. Several TLR small molecule immune potentiators (SMIPs) (e.g. TLR2 and TLR7 small molecule agonists) have recently been discovered by HTS, which has allowed screening of millions of compounds for adjuvanticity, and these SMIPs have been used as vaccines adjuvants.49,50 The efficiency of HTS allows rapid determination of potential adjuvant hits, making this platform a powerful tool for adjuvant discovery. Since not all TLRs have small molecule agonists (e .g. TLRs 3, 5, and 9), HTS can quickly determine what types of chemical structures activate specific TLRs. A multiplexed high throughput method was used to screen several compound libraries (>100,000 compounds) for specific PRR activity with the aim to dis cover new small molecule adjuvants.86 From the molec ule screen, amphotericin B (AmpB) was discovered to elicit TLR2 and TLR4 immune activity, with an immune response profile similar to MPLA, suggesting the potential of AmpB as a new adjuvant. Zhang and colleagues also used HTS technology to screen a library of compounds for activity against TLR3.87 With one hit compound, they performed structure activity relationship (SAR) studies leading to one m olecule that activates TLRs 3, 8, and 9. All three TLRs are activated by virus -derived nucleic acids, which may explain how this one molecule can activate all three TLRs. 17 The HTS platform provided analysis of 59 different compounds and subsequent derivativ es of the hit small molecule. These processes would be laborious and time consuming without high throughput technology. Applying medicinal chemistry approaches and high throughput screening to adjuvant discovery can lead to other synergistic small molecule adjuvants, where pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and biodistribution properties can all be optimized. In addition, HTS has been applied to the analysis and characterization of synergistic immune responses from specific agonist combinations. Immune sy nergies typically have been studied using standard cytokine readouts, such as ELISA.85 However, ELISA is not the most efficient method to analyze multiple cytokines, since only one cytokine can be measured at a time. The invention of multiplexed screens, like Luminex assays, improved the screening process, providing the ability to analyze a larger number of samples or multiple cytokines in a single sample. Unfortunately, this type of technolo gy still suffers from a detection limit of pg/mL, resulting in the requirement for high volumes of supernatant or sera.54,86 To circumvent these challenges, Garcia -Cordero and collea gues developed a nanoscale high throughput immunoassay chip using soft lithography techniques to analyze synergistic activity between PRR agonist combinations .84 Their data provided results comparable to that obtained by traditional ELISAs. Their microfluidic device can detect four different biomarkers using only nanoliters of sera in a 384 well plate format. They ca n also reach a lower detection limit of 100 fM with in vitro cell media and in vivo sera. Using their technology, they identified agonist combinations from 10 different TLR agonists that resulted in synergistic or inhibitory cytokine production. They valid ated their synergistic in vitro observations in an in vivo model system. The ability to screen a large quantity of PRR agonist combinations in a dose dependent manner provides a faster and more cost -efficient readout to determine effective immune responses from distinct agonist combinations for adjuvant discovery. Multiplex assays 18 still face challenges with non -specific binding and cross reactivity when analyzing complex biological samples, but this technology is a step toward developing platforms that solv e analytical challenges and screen for compounds that elicit desired immune responses. 1.11 Chemically Conjugated Synergistic Adjuvants The discovery of synergistic interactions between multiple types of PRRs has led to the covalent conjugation of PAMP s to develop new multi -agonist adjuvants that improve vaccine immunogenicity. PAMPs are spatially associated with one another due to the natural structure of pathogens. Although unconjugated mixtures of multiple PRR agonists elicit synergistic immune activ ity, this approach does not mimic the spatial component of PRR activation by a pathogen. Adjuvants that are mixtures of unconjugated agonists can diffuse through the immune system and may get cleared more readily. To address this issue, a panel of dimeric TLR agonists was synthesized, containing combinations of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 agonists, which were separated by PEG 6, PEG 12, and PEG 24 linkers 88,89. These single molecular entities aimed to mimic the spatial proximity of immunostimulatory components in natural pathogens with initial inspiration from the herpes simplex virus 63. Evaluation of these compounds' immunostimulatory activity provided evidence that the immunogenicity was dependent on the linker length, the specific combination of conjugated TLR agonists, and the sizes of the agonists due to possible steric interactions, all important considerations for adjuvant development. Chimeric molecules with potent immunostimulatory capabilities provide new adjuvant options and potentially lower adjuvant doses in vaccines. Developing more potent and effective immunostimulants via covalent conjugation has led to the application of these tools as adjuvants in vaccination models. The first example of this was CL429, a chimeric molecule containing the agonists Pam 2C and Murabuti de, which stimulates 19 TLR2 and NOD2, respectively 90. CL429 was used as an adjuvant in a HIV -1 subunit vaccine and increased HIV -1 p-24 antigen specific IgG and IgA antibody titers when compared to either the individual agonists or a mixture of the unconjugate d TLR2 and NOD2 agonists. The ability to induce specific and high antibody titers of different subtypes further demonstrated the utility of PRR agonist conjugation in modulating the immune response and improving adjuvant potency. Covalently linked PRR agon ist research was further explored to the development of a trimeric agonist adjuvant, since many pathogens contain agonists for 3 -5 different PRRs 60,62,91. The trimeric molecule is composed of TLR4, 7, and 9 agonists linked to a triazine core. The tri -agonist increased antibody breadth and depth to vaccinia virus antigens in a vaccinia model vaccination study and elicited a more balanced T H1/T H2 immune response compared to its unconjugated counterparts or the corresponding conjugated di -agonists. This balanced a nd enhanced antigen specific response may elicit unique and potentially protective cellular and antibody immune responses, compared to solely a T H1 or T H2 response. The covalently linked PRR agonists demonstrate that spatial components play an important ro le in effective immune system activation. The synthetic systems discussed are also modular, so that PRR agonists can be exchanged to test different immune synergies. The specific combination of covalently linked agonists is crucial to obtain the desired i mmune response, as each agonist stimulates characteristic immune signaling pathways and cytokine production. Looking forward, this technology can also be used to conjugate antigens to synergistic agonist combinations. Single agonist -antigen conjugates have been successful in enhancing the immune response, possibly due to efficient antigen presentation that results from colocalization of the antigen and adjuvant in the same endosome 92,93. Therefore, synergistic adjuvant -antigen conjugates should be considered for future vaccine development and formulation. As an example, synergistic TLR agonist combinations have been conjugated to whole 20 tumor cell anti gens and exhibited enhanced activation marker and cytokine responses 94. Further probing synergistic agonist -antigen combinations may provide valuable information to help design improved vaccines in a more methodical manner. 1.12 Particulate Delivery Systems for Immune Synergies In addition to covalent localization of multi -agonist adjuvants, particulate vaccine delivery systems have been synthesized that mimic pathogens in size and spatial organization 95,96. Particulate systems, including nanopa rticles, nanodiscs, and liposomes, that range from sub - to low micron in diameter provide cargo delivery at sizes similar to that of a virus or bacteria 97,98. These delivery systems have shown enhanced antigen uptake by APCs, which can lead to increased antigen presentation and immune activation 99,100. Biodegradable PLGA particles (~300 nm in diamete r) have been developed to encapsulate or adsorb dual or triple combinations of TLR agonists, imitating the size and composition of a pathogen 101,102. Mice immunized with multi -TLR agonist adjuvant formulations have demonstrated distinct changes in the immune response compared to the use of one agonist or antig en alone. These immune responses include the production of the highest avidity antibody titers toward the target antigen and balanced T H1/T H2 responses via increased IgG1 and IgG2c levels 101. While targeting the antigen and adjuvant to the same endosome is known to increase antigen presentation, stronger humoral responses were observed when the antigen and adjuvant were in separate nanoparticles, requiring more mechanistic investigation 102. Even so, delivering antigen and adjuvant in different particles would provide a platform system for vaccine formula tion development. Nanodiscs are another novel adjuvant delivery system developed to encapsulate dual TLR agonist combinations 98. Immunizations with this scaffold led to a reduction in plasma chole sterol levels and potent anti - tumor activity in two different model systems, presenting another efficacious platform that can 21 easily combine synergistic adjuvants with a range of antigens. Other techniques, such as mesoporous silica templating and agonist adsorption to particles via electrostatic and non -covalent interactions, have also been used to synthesize multi -PRR adjuvant delivery systems. Mesoporous silica templating provides uniform particles with high surface area for agonist loading. In an in vivo OVA model, and enhanced CD4+ and humoral TH1 responses when compared to either NOD2 or TLR9 agonist -loaded particles 103. Tukhvatulin and activating TLR4 instead of TLR9, both T H1 and T H2 responses were enhanced as well as OVA specific IgG antibodies across multiple subsets (IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3), demonstrating an increased breadth in the immune response. These results show how activating multiple PRRs can tune the immune response depending on the PRRs ac tivated and how an agonist's role can change depending on the agonist pairing. Another advantage of particle delivery systems is that their physiochemical properties can be tuned to target cargo delivery, alter release kinetics, and direct the immune resp onse. Particulate delivery vehicles that traffic to specific locations in vivo and depot in tissues to provide slow drug release have had a significant impact on vaccine efficacy. Lynn and colleagues synthesized a nanoparticulate adjuvant that exemplified targeted biodistribution 100. A TLR7/8 agonist was conjugated to a polymer scaffold at different densities and with varying polymer attributes, such as linker length and composition. Increased density of the TLR agonist on the polymer scaffold resulted in particle formation (~700 nm) of the polymer. The particulate form of the adjuvant led to higher cytokine production in the lymph nodes, promoted local lymph node retention and APC uptake, limited systemic toxicity, and enhanced protective T cell responses. They have since 22 shown the b road applicability of this idea to a number of proteins and adjuvants.105,106 Applying this technology to multiple PRR agonists and immune synergy studies may provide targeted delivery, specific biodistribution, and mechanistic insight into immune activation. 1.13 Synergistic Adjuvants in Vaccination Models Currently, a number of experimental adjuvants interact with multiple families of PRRs, synergistically stimulating several immune signaling pathways, and have been used in model vaccination studies, including M. tuberculosis and HIV ( Table 1.3).56,76,90,91,97,101 -104,107 -115 These newly developed adjuvant formulations have led to enhanced immunogenicity and prolonged responses via the increase in magnitude, avidity, and breadth of specific cellular and antibody subtypes as well as reduced disease burden, providing protection in challe nge studies. Shifts in TH2 (IgG1) to T H1 (IgG2c) antibody subtypes and cellular responses have also been observed and resulted in reduced parasite burden116. Multi -PRR adjuvant systems have resulted in lower reactogenicity and local inflammation compared to commercial adjuvant systems, demonstrating safety improvements from current adjuvants 117-120. These types of distinct molecular adjuvants will be necessary to achieve defined immunogenicity and sa fety profiles, affording more straightforward vaccine characterization that can guide future vaccine development. 23 Table 1.3 Synergistic PRR Combinations Activated by Adjuvants in Vaccination Models. PRR Synergistic Combination Ligands tuberculosis Leishmania , TC-1 tumor, OVA 58, malaria Several synergistic systems (AS01, AS02, and AS15) developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) show promise in clinical applications (Table 4) 121,122. AS01 and AS02 adjuvant formulations, composed of MPLA (TLR4) and saponin QS21 (NLRP3), have been utilized in malaria vaccines and can elicit strong T cell responses 123. Currently, these adjuvants are being tested with experimental vaccines for a variety of disease models, including HIV and tuberculosis 117,118,124. AS15 is composed of Q S21, MPLA, and CpG oligonucleotide in a liposomal formulation and has been efficacious in anti -cancer vaccines 124. Higher antibody titers and stronger T cell responses were obtained with vaccine formulations containing AS15 adjuvant compared to AS02B adjuvant. The higher efficacy m ay be attributed to the addition of CpG oligonucleotide in AS15. GSK also performed a comparative study of their Adjuvant System (AS) formulations using a hepatitis B model antigen 125. They observed differenc es in the magnitude (i.e. antibody titers), but not the quality (i.e. functional cytokine profiles) of the immune response. Their findings were surprising due to the different adjuvant compositions, but warrant more extensive readouts to compare. CAF09 is an emerging synergistic adjuvant that targets the Mincle (C -type lectin) and TLR3 receptors with monomycoloyl glycerol (MMG) and Poly(I:C), respectively 52. It is a cationic adjuvant formulation that is starting to be used in the clinic. Favorable immune responses have been observed, including robust CD8+ T cell responses, higher cytokine release per T cell, and efficacious responses with lower antigen doses, thus demonstrating the importance of targeting alternative PRRs and their respective activation pathways 126,127. Another interesting synergy is the combination of trehalose (also a C -type lectin activation cells.128 With these multi -PRR activating adjuvants in the 25 pipeline exhibiting promising protection and efficacy, we can learn from the successes of these synergistic adjuvants and apply our findings to the design of next generation adjuvants for commercial applications. Table 1.4 Synergistic Adjuvants Employed in Clinical Trials. 1.15 Applying Synergistic Studies to Adjuvant Design With these promising synergistic adjuvants in the clinic, new adjuvant development should employ the knowledge gained from clinical and fundamental synergistic studies. Researchers have started to apply the immunogenicity profiles from pathogens to develop improved vaccines. Understanding how natural pathogens function and utilizing known mechanisms of infection are also important factors when designing adjuvants. For example, M. tuberculosis activates the immune system through TLRs 2, 4, and 9 56. Combining all three TLR agonists to create a multi - agonist adjuvant system may further improve M. tuberculosis vaccines. Applying similar strategies to fight other diseases will be important to design effective adjuvants. Improved adjuva nt design and vaccine efficacy will also need approaches that control the dose and time release of synergistic cargo, target specific cellular compartments and cell types, and study single cell expression profiles in vivo . Napolitani and colleagues examine d synergistic Synergistic Adjuvant lectin), TLR3) NCT03412786 26 immune activation over time at specific doses and the order in which distinct PRRs were activated 129. Analyzin g the temporal aspect of synergistic immune responses displayed when specific cytokine responses peaked. They also observed that enhanced immune responses depended on the order in which two distinct TLR agonists were administered. The ability to control th e timing of the immune response and dictate the order in which PRRs are activated are both important considerations for vaccine development. These capabilities can be incorporated into new technologies, including covalent chemistries, nanoparticulate syste ms, or photocaged agonists. Designing molecules with distinct pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties as well as defined formulations can temporally control immune activation to provide desired drug release kinetics and immune activation profiles. Targeting particular cellular compartments is another important factor because PRRs are expressed in distinct cellular locations based on the chemical identity of the PAMP, the signaling pathways activated, and the types of responses produced 130. The chemical identity of immune agonists and their corresponding recepto rs have been determined to be key contributors to the synergistic immune response 84,85. Directing drugs to specific cellular compartments has been demonstrated by many groups 131. Agonists formulated with cationic lipids and lipidated immunostimulants have been synthesized to allow for longer resonance times within the endosome as well as ta rget the draining lymph nodes to improve antigen presentation 130,132. Beyond cellula r compartments, specific immune cell subtypes play an essential role in the types of immune responses elicited based on different PRR expression profiles 133-135. Several researchers have characterized PRR expression on different types of immune cel ls using RT -PCR. Specific cell subtypes and lymphatic organs can be directly targeted based on unique cell surface receptors or markers, such as DEC -205 and DC -SIGN 136,137. Designing synergistic ligands) or covalent inhibitor properties will allow targeting toward specific cellular locations and cell subtypes. As a result, distinct PRR combinations and subsequent synergistic signaling pathways can be activated and potentially reduce systemic toxicity and clearance. When studying PRR expression and activation of various immun e subsets, the challenge in analysis continues to be with the differences between species and tissue types. This information should be kept in mind when designing vaccination models. While examining overall cellular responses is crucial for studying immun e synergies, single cell analysis has emerged as a powerful tool that permits the extraction of critical data from individual cells that is obscured in bulk assays. Many single cell analysis studies utilize single cell RNA sequencing (RNA -Seq) technology i n order to quantify RNA transcription levels across the genome 138,139. Utilization of techniques, such as RNA -Seq, may lead to new insight into the mechanism of immune agonist synergies. The data obtained can also potentially provide new and essential information regarding cell signaling and the efficacy of targeting agonis t synergies to specific tissues, cell subtypes, or subcellular compartments 140,141. Analyses of such single cell data have shown that there are rare subsets of cells that may initiate immune responses 142. The integration of detai led single cell data into the population context may provide a deeper understanding of the mechanism behind immune synergies. This data may, in turn, inform the development of more potent and precisely targeted synergistic adjuvants. Single cell techniques will also be invaluable in characterizing the downstream effects of adjuvants. Characterizing the type of antibody producing B -cells, the T -cell composition and overall lymphnode response to specific adjuvants.143 28 1.16 Characterizing Synergistic Vaccine Efficacy The yellow fever vaccine, a live, attenuated version of the virus, acts through TLRs 2, 7, 8, and 9 and is one of the most successful vaccines developed 61,62. The high efficacy of the vaccine is a result of the polyvalent immune response elicited, comprised of a wide range of critical cellular and antibody responses (i.e. CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, IgG, IgM). The cooperation of this broad set of immune responses results in responses that are rapidly produced and peak at different times post immunization. In addition, protective antibodies are present up to 40 years after the initial vaccinat ion, where all of these aspects are crucial to the overall robustness of the vaccine. The yellow fever vaccine demonstrates the significant role of a prolonged immune response and the production of different types of immune responses at specific times. The refore, analyzing the robustness of the immune response from synergistic vaccines over time will be of utmost importance. Depending on the disease, there are clear readouts, such as bacterial clearance, reduced parasite burden, and tumor volume. In additio n, vaccines can be tracked, using techniques such as luminescence and PET imaging, to visualize vaccine biodistribution and correlate a vaccine's biophysicochemical properties to its efficacy. These measures of vaccine efficacy need to be monitored to ensu re sustained protective responses in challenge studies and clearance of the target pathogen. The kinetic profile of different branches of the immune response and dose response curves should be characterized for synergistic vaccines. The types of immune res ponses and the corresponding times elicited are critical to communication within the immune system and the efficacy of the vaccine 61,129 ,134,144. Also, dose response curves for synergistic adjuvants do not always exhibit the expected peak shape and can display a Gaussian -like curve, providing crucial information about the proper administration dose 145,146. Correlating synergistic vaccine 29 formulations to pathogen clearance, response robustness, and specific cytokine, cellular, and antibody responses over time will provide a more comprehensive under standing of the relationship between vaccine composition, resulting immune responses, and adjuvant and vaccine efficacy. High throughput technology can aid in analyzing large amounts of data and determining trends. Even so, it will be imperative to careful ly examine large data sets to arrive at accurate conclusions. 1.17 Future Perspective of synergies in vaccines Applying synergistic combinations of PRR agonists to vaccine adjuvant design has led to more effective immune responses and higher protective efficacy via increases in titers and breadth of cellular and antibody responses. Inspiration for new and simple to manufacture adjuvants may be attained from some of the emerging PRR agonists (see Outstanding Questions), such as STING and C -type lectin agonists that stimulate other signaling pathways, including TBK1 -IRF3 and Syk - CARD9, and may access immune responses that other adjuvants cannot. Recently, STING agonists have gained considerable attention for immunotherapy applications (https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i9/STING -fever -sweeping -through -cancer.html). Although synergy studies have been limited, synergistic effects have been observed between STING and TLR9 to reduce tumor growth via potent T H1 responses 147, demonstrating the potential to expand the adjuvant toolbox with other effective PRR synergies. However, most STING agonists are cyclic -dinucleotides, which have poor drug properties and are difficult to formulate, and small molecule agonists have only be en reported for murine STING 148,149. Thus, similar to other TLR agonists, potential therapies involving STING activation could greatly benefit from HTS and SAR studies to determine human STING agonists with improved pharmacological properties. C -type lectins are another attractive target for future immune synergies, where enhanced polyfunctional and age -dependent immune responses have been observed with TLR3 and T LR7/8 agonists 52,150. 30 Although, not all PRR combinations enhance the immune response, rather this cross talk can inhibit immune activation 84,150. But inhibitory responses can potentially be used as an advantage to down regulate undesired immune responses (e.g . autoimmune diseases). The novel technologies discussed have aided in the development of new synergistic adjuvants and delivery systems as well as analytical platforms for synergistic immune responses. Looking forward, improved model systems and analytic al readouts will be crucial to design and develop future vaccines. Vaccines perform differently depending on the adjuvant and result in varying degrees of efficacy, as observed in a head -to-head comparison of several clinical adjuvants in a standard set of vaccination models 55. From this study, the proper adjuvant and corresponding immune responses could be determined for a target disease, thus characterizing novel adjuvants in a similar manner should be considered. It will also be imperative to use the most comparable model system, which may involv e human tissue or whole blood assays, in order to streamline vaccine development and avoid misleading conclusions. The challenge in using human samples results from high costs and lack of supply - receiving enough material to perform studies in an efficien t time frame. In silico modeling may provide a cost effective alternative to predict vaccine efficacy and address the aforementioned challenges. Systems vaccinology and immunoinformatics can be powerful tools to improve vaccine design (i.e. predict pathoge n epitope changes for elusive diseases that are constantly mutating) 151. Computational modeling has its limitations and is based on certain assumptions, but these approaches show great promise if validated properly in vivo and with the proper inpu ts from current data sets to build the model. 1.18 Challenges of using TLR agonists as vaccine adjuvants With all of these new adjuvant and formulation technologies, it is crucial to consider the safety profile of the vaccination materials152. For example, the amount of systemic cytokines produced, 31 cell viability, and off targets effects should all be monitored. Several considerations, including formulation and administration route, can drastically alter the immune response, potentially providing synergistic or inhibitory responses. Particulate formu lation or additives, such as squalene oil -in-water emulsions, can synergistically enhance the immune response and may be an alternative approach to develop potent adjuvants, while avoiding toxic side effects 153,154. In addition, simply changing the administration route can change wh at immune cells are targeted and the responses elicited, providing another method to obtain improved immune responses (e.g. intraperitoneal versus subcutaneous injections)154. With these considerations in mind, the application of immune synerg ies to modulate the immune response is and will be a powerful tool for novel and more rational adjuvant discovery, thereby impacting future development of safer and more effective vaccines. 1.19 Understanding synergies Although it is clear that immune syne rgies can both quantitatively enhance the magnitude of the immune response and qualitatively modify the expression pattern of a variety of genes, the mechanistic understanding of how this occurs remains elusive.41 Our lab is designing tools to allow us to probe these synergies while gaining a mechanistic understanding of how PRRs work together to provide enhanced immunity. This fundamental understanding will lead to improved vaccine formulations. 1.20 Vaccine side effects While combinations of TLR agonists or single TLR agonists have demonstrated immense promise as vaccine adjuvants, many induce high and unsafe le vels of systemic inflammation. Often the dose of TLR agonist required to acquire adequate immunity is above the threshold that induces extreme levels of inflammatory cytokines leading to failed clinical trials. CpG DNA is potent 32 adjuvant that produces enha nced antigen -specific immune responses with less toxicity than many other adjuvants.155 However this adjuvant has only been approved for us e in the last year in one vaccine, Heplasiv -B.156 All other clinical trials including CpG DNA in vaccines have failed to complete clinical trials, many due to the safety.157,158 1.21 References 1.

Current approved adjuvants are unable to provide desired responses against some pathogens (e.g. HIV or dengue). Many new adjuvants have been developed and demonstrate promising results, but side effects from the inflammatory response induced by these adjuvants have resulted in limited FDA approvals. No adjuvants yet possess the capability to independently modulate inflammation and pro tection. Here we demonstrate a method to limit inflammation and side effects associated with vaccination while retaining the protective responses using a variety of promising adjuvants. To accomplish this, we combined a selective NF -B inhibitor with the i mmune adjuvant. The resulting vaccines reduce systemic inflammation and boost antibody responses. In an influenza challenge model, we demonstrate that this approach enhances protection . This method is generalizable across a broad range of adjuvants and antigens. We anticipate these studies will lead to a novel approach to vaccine formulation design that may prove general across a wide range of adjuvants, enabling their greater use in the p ublic realm. 2.2 Introduction Vaccines are considered one of the most effective global health interventions against infectious diseases. Despite their success, current and future vaccines face contradictory challenges of increasingly stringent safety marg ins and more effective and diverse protective responses. A major challenge in developing new vaccine approaches is striking a balance between effective 51 immune activation, leading to protective responses, and limiting the excess inflammation and side effect s. To boost the immune response, toll -like receptor (TLR) agonists have been explored as vaccine adjuvants because they activate the innate immune system, promoting the expression of a wide variety of immune genes including inflammatory cytokines and cell surface receptors important for T cell interactions.1-6 Effective TLR agonists stimulate the desired cellular or humoral adaptive responses; however, the excessive inflammation induced by many of these compounds has made it challenging to transition them into new clinical vaccines.7 For example, CpG DNA, a TLR 9 agonist, has wide -ranging promise as a vaccine adjuvant and provides protection for diseases currently without a vaccine, such as HIV.8 CpG DNA also enables vaccines to be produced with less antig en9, induces protective responses faster10, and produces effective anti-tumor activity.11,12 CpG has demonstrated great promise in increasing seroprotective antibody titers in human clinical trials.13,14 However, the excessive inflammatory response induced by this adjuvant has resulted in many clinical trial failures and is cited as limiting its therapeutic promise.15,16 CpGs are only a fraction of the hundreds of TLR agonists.17 However due to the unsafe side effects, only a handful of TLR agonists are ap proved for limited use in humans.18 Studies indicate that side effects are mediated through excessive and systemic distribution of TNF - and IL -6.19,20 Here we demonstrate a method to decouple part of the inflammatory response from the antigen presenting actions of several adjuvants using an immune potentiator. Using a broad range of TLR agonists, we demonstrate both in vitro and in vivo that using an immune potentiator decreases proinflammatory cytokines while maintaining adaptive immune function. In vivo , we find that co -administering the immune potentiator with the 2017 -2018 flu vaccine (Fluzone) decreases side effects associated with vaccination and increases protection. Co -administration of the immune potentiator with CpG -ODN1826 (CpG) and dengue capsi d protein leads to elimination 52 of systemic proinflammatory cytokines post -vaccination and yields sustained neutralizing antibodies. Additionally, administering the immune potentiator with CpG and gp120, a HIV viral coat protein, increased serum IgG and vag inal IgA antibodies and shifted IgG antibody epitope recognition. Lastly, we observed immune potentiation and improved safety for several TLR agonists - implying a general approach. Immune potentiation may find use in reducing the systemic side effects ass ociated with inflammation for many adjuvanted vaccines21- creating the potential for many PRR agonists to be used safely, increasing the diversity of adaptive immune profiles and widening the scope of disease prevention and treatment. 2.3 Results and discussion 2.3.1 Selection of Immune Potentiator In seeking a method of immune potentiation, we explored the extensive research on the TLR activation pathway. This powerful mechanistic framework let us hypothesize about how TLR activation directs inflammat ory cytokines and antigen presentation. As TLR pathways converge with NF -B activation, and inflammatory and adaptive responses diverge upon which NF -B subunit is activated, we hypothesized that we could decouple these processes via selective inhibition - leading to reduced side effects but maintaining the adaptive response. Upon TLR activation, the transcription factor NF -B primes the transcription of pro -inflammatory cytokines such as IL -6 and TNF - , cell surface receptors such as MHC CD40, CD8 0 and CD86.22- 24 The NF -B family is a family of transcription factors, consisting of two subunits: a DNA binding domain and a transcriptional activator.25,26 Each NF -B dimer controls expression of a different set of genes for distinct cellular processes - broadly, some dimers control inflammatory 53 expression while others control antigen presentation. 25-27 Selectively modulating a pathway, we conjectured, might lead to increased antigen presentation, while decreasing inflammation. NF -B inhibitors have been widely explored for reducing cytokine expression in cancer28-31, autoimmune disorders,32,33 and sepsis,34-36 yet they have not been explored as vaccine potentiators. This lack of experimentation may be because it is broadly understood that NF -B activation is necessary in mounting an adequate adaptive immune response.31,37 However, only certain subunits direct antig en presentation38. As a proof -of-concept immune potentiator we chose SN50, a cell permeable peptide that consists of the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of the NF -B subunit, p50 which blocks the import of p50 containing dimers into the nucleus.39 First, we sought to determine if SN50 enables inhibition of NF -B of innate immune cells. We validated that SN50 reduced total NF -B activity in human (THP -1 monocytes) and mouse (RAW macrophages) cells in a dose dependent manner. ( Fig. A1). Figure 2.1.

We incubated murine bone marrow - derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) with SN50 and CpG or CpG alone for 6h and analyzed how the potentiator altered cytokine production and cell surface receptor expression ( Fig. 2.1a, Fig. A2). Intracellular cytokine staining revealed that cells treated with SN50 demonstrated a 21% decrease in cells expressing TNF - and a 13% decrease in cells expressing IL -6. Meanwhile, CD86 was upregulated by 22% and CD40 was down regulated by 2.5%. Because the p65 -p50 dimer is the most abundant dimer found in resting cells and involved in inflammatory cytokine production, we conjecture that by inhibiting this dimer, we enable the transcription and translation of cell surface receptors while limiting inflammatory cytokines. This is c onsistent with previous knockout experiments that demonstrate the significance of the p65 subunit in increasing inflammatory cytokine production and inhibition of CD40 and CD86.38 The result is lower inflammatory responses while priming effective adaptive immune communication. After observing that SN50 can limit inflammation without decreasing cell surface receptor expression in vitro, we next wanted to examine the effect in vivo. To determine if inhibition of NF-B could decrease the systemic levels of pr o-inflammatory cytokines associated with CpG vaccination, we vaccinated mice intramuscularly (i.m.) with 100 \u00b5g ovalbumin + CpG, or SN50M (500 \u00b5g) + CpG. SN50M is a physical control for SN50 as it is a much weaker inhibitor. We chose to measure systemic levels of proinflammatory cytokines TNF - and IL -6 because high levels are unsafe and lead to side 55 effects.119,20,40 We measured these pro -inflammatory cytokines at 1h, 3h, 6h, 24h and 48h post - injection in all groups to determine the timepoint where cytokines peak in response to CpG vaccination ( Fig. 2.1b, 1.1c, Fig. A3). Mice vaccinated with OVA and PBS or SN50 alone elicited no systemic cytokine response. CpG demonstrated the highest response of both TNF - (1325 pg/mL) and IL -6 1h timepoint. The CpG + SN50 group showed complete elimination of cytokines for both cytokines. The CpG + SN50M group showed a decrease in cytokine levels, although not as large as observed with CpG + SN50. We confirmed that this decrease in inflammatory cytokines is due to the high local inhibition of injected SN50M and not physical aggregation ( Fig. A3). To determine how SN50 would affect the humoral response, we analyzed serum antibody levels on day 28 ( Fig. 2.1d). We chose to use an ELISA that measures total Ig(G+A+M).41 The CpG group demonstrated a 2.4 -fold increase in anti -OVA antibodies compared to PBS alone. Mice vaccinated with CpG + SN50 demonstrated a 5.9 -fold increase over the PBS group and 2.7 -fold increase over the CpG group. These data confirmed our hypothesis that high levels of systemic TNF - and IL -6 can be decoupled from the humoral, adaptive immune response. We were surprised to find that addition of SN50 boosted the downstream adaptive response, leading to immune potentiation. Due to this increase in adaptive response and improved safety profile after vaccination we consider SN50 to be an immune potentiator. 1 In humans, systemic TNF- correlate with local side effects (e.g. swelling, pain at injection site) and systemic IL -6 has been correlated with system -wide side effects (e.g. fatigue, headache, etc.) in response to vaccination.19,20 Additionally, both of these cytokines act as pyro gens when distributed systemically, leading to a fever response.40 56 Figure 2.2.

We selected influenza vaccine as a proof -of-concept vaccination both due to its universality and the relative ease of running animal challenges with multiple parameters. We sought to determine if SN50 would reduce side effects associated with strong adjuvanticit y and to see what effect this alteration on systemic cytokines would have on protection. We vaccinated mice i.m. with Fluzone\u00ae quadrivalent vaccine (Fz) for the 2017/2018 influenza season, with or without CpG (50 \u00b5g) as an immune adjuvant and 500 \u00b5g SN50 ( SN50 H) or 50 an immune potentiator. The Fz + SN50 group demonstrated lower levels of TNF - than Fz alone ( Fig. 2.2b, 2.2c). Across all groups, the addition of SN50 reduced levels of TNF - and IL -6 to levels consistent with the place bo group. To examine whether SN50 can mitigate side effects from vaccination, we analyzed the percent change in body weight 24, 48 and 72h post -vaccination ( Fig. 2.2d, A4). Weight loss is the easiest and most objective measure of side effects in mice. Mice vaccinated with Fz and Fz + SN50 lost an average of 0.85% and 0.75%, respectively by the 24h timepoint. The Fz + CpG group lost an average of 5.9%. Adding SN50 H decreased the amount of weight loss to 2.4% and SN50 L to 5.1%. At 72h the Fz group were -1.1% of the starting weight whereas mice vaccinated with Fz + SN50 gained +1.5%. The Fz + CpG group lost -1.6% of the starting weight and adding SN50 H lead to a reduction in weight loss (0% change) and adding SN50 L lead to -1.3% change. Overall, mice with SN50 lost less weight than mice without SN50, demonstrating that SN50 lowered side effects associated with vaccination. We next wanted to see if the addition of SN50 would change the T cell responses or antibody production. On day 14, we analyzed splenocy tes for antigen specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We observed no statistically significant differences between samples with and without SN50 58 (Fig. 2.2e, 2.2f, Fig. A5). On day 28, we analyzed the serum for antibody levels in the blood ( Fig. 2.2g and A6). There was no significant difference in serum IgG concentration between Fz and Fz + SN50. There was a significant difference between Fz samples and Fz + CpG of 2.9 fold. There was no significant difference between groups vaccinated with CpG, implying th at the addition of SN50 reduces inflammation and side effects from vaccination, while maintaining the antibody concentration. We next sought to determine if SN50 would increase the protection of Fluzone. Mice were lethally challenged intranasally with 105 PFU A/Michigan/45/2015. On day 3 post -challenge we analyzed the lungs of three mice for viral titer ( Fig. A4). Survival was analyzed for 14 days post - challenge ( Fig. 2.2h). By day 7, all placebo mice and 60% of the Fz mice had reached the humane endpoint and were euthanized. All other mice survived. The Fz + SN50 group was significantly more protected than the Fz alone group. The addition of SN50 to Fz + CpG confers equal protection, while improving side effects from the initial vaccination. Surprisingly, simply adding SN50 to Fz conferred enhanced protection equal to Fz + CpG group. Mice were analyzed for change in body weight and body temperature for 14 days post - challenge ( Fig. 2.2i, 2.2j, Fig. A4). The peak average weight loss between ( -9.9%) and F z + SN50 ( -2.67%) was statistically significant. Greater weight loss is associated with a more intense infection, these data demonstrate that adding SN50 to Fz improves the response to infection. Addition of SN50 to Fz + CpG demonstrates no significant cha nge in weight loss indicating that the SN50 can reduce systemic cytokines and side effects from vaccination with no detrimental effects to the protective response. As an additional parameter of disease pathology, we examined body temperature post - challenge . Unlike in humans, mice demonstrate a reduction in body temperature upon infection.42 59 The placebo has the largest peak drop in temperature ( -4.57 \u00b0C), followed Fz or Fz + CpG mitigated the decrease i n temperature across all groups. Safety and protection of new vaccine adjuvants are typically considered two interdependent variables with an inverse relationship, where adequate protection is acquired by limiting safety or vice versa. As this potentiator makes the vaccine both safer and more protective, we sought a single way to analyze how SN50 was changing the safety and protection profile. As these variables are considered inversely related, there are few precedents for correlation. However, a common scoring system used widely across fields is a quartile -based scoring system.43-46 Following precedent for scoring systems, we developed a safety vs protection plot ( Fig. A7). This plot is meant only to serve as a visual representation of all data collected within this study. All groups that included SN50 in the vaccination increased both the safety and the protection of the vaccine. When all data is taken together, we conclude that SN50 acts as an immune potentiator by both increasing the safety profile and improving the protective outcome of the vaccination. Next, we wanted to examine if this type of immune potentiator could improve safety and maintain the adaptive response across a broader range of diseases and antigens. We chose to vaccinate against dengue and HIV because they represent additional, important diseases with active vaccine research. In each case, challenges with current methods have been identified and we wanted to see if SN50 could help address those challenges, as well as maintain the current function of vaccination strategies. For dengue, the main challenge is producing antibodies that neutralize the virus, inhibiting cellular uptake. For HIV, a key challenge is in generating IgA antibodies at the mucosal interface as well as eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies targeted to 60 select epitope s. To explore how adding an immune potentiator affects each of these responses, we analyzed each antigen set in greater detail. 61 Figure 2.3.

(I) Mean intensity of each recognized epitope by CpG (red bars) or CpG + SN50 (blue bars). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. 62 2.3.4 Examination of immune potentiator on Dengue neutralization To explore dengue further, we vaccinated mice with the capsid protein of dengue serotype 2 (DENV eliminated expression of systemic cytokines ( Fig. 2.3a, 2.3b). On day 28 we analyzed the difference in antibody concentration ( Fig. 2.3c). Antibody concentration in CpG + SN50 mice were almost two -fold higher than the CpG group. To determine if SN50 alters the neutralization potential, we analyzed the neutralizing tite r for four strains of dengue ( Fig. 2.3d). We tested four serum samples against one strain representative of each dengue serotype. The differences in neutralization potential were not significantly different between the two groups implying that, similar to our flu results, SN50 improves the safety while maintaining the protective responses of vaccination. 2.3.5 Analysis of influence of immune potentiator on HIV vaccination To further test the efficacy of vaccines with SN50 and to attain a broader picture of the induced humoral immune response, we vaccinated mice with gp120, a viral coat protein from HIV necessary for infection and a target of many HIV vaccines, using CpG as the immune adjuvant. Mice vaccinated with CpG demonstrated high levels of b oth TNF - and IL -6, whereas all other groups including mice vaccinated with CpG + SN50 demonstrated non -detectable levels of systemic cytokines at the 1h time point ( Fig. 2.3e, 2.3f). On day 28, we analyzed the serum anti - gp120 antibody concentration. Th e CpG + SN50 group induced a 4.7 fold higher anti -gp120 IgG antibody level than the CpG group in the serum ( Fig. 2.3g, 2.3h). This demonstrates that the addition of SN50 increases IgG antibody levels across multiple antigens and suggests that it may serve as a general immune potentiator. Because mucous membranes are particularly susceptible to 63 HIV infection, we also measured the anti -gp120 IgG and IgA antibody concentration in vaginal secretions ( Fig. 2.3i, 2.3j). The CpG + SN50 group demonstrated a 4.4 fol d increase in anti -gp120 IgA antibodies than mice vaccinated with CpG alone. These results suggest that SN50 with gp120 may help induce class -switching to IgA antibody isotype. We next chose to determine if there were any alterations in the gp120 epitopes recognized by the resulting antibodies, using an overlapping peptide microarray. Interestingly, the number of epitopes recognized by CpG alone was higher than antibodies collected from CpG + SN50 mice; however, the fluorescent mean intensity of recognized epitopes is higher in the CpG + SN50 mice (Fig. 2.3k, 2.3l) - implying a higher concentration of antibodies against those epitopes. Upon closer inspection of particular epitopes recognized, we saw that adding the immune potentiator to the formulation shift s the epitope recognition, as different epitopes are recognized in the CpG alone and CpG + SN50, often exclusively in one condition or the other ( Fig. 2.3m). The most highly recognized epitope in the CpG + SN50 group corresponds to the epitope recognized by the recently isolated 35O22 monoclonal antibody.46 Antibodies isolated from mice vaccinated with CpG + SN50 also recognize the CD4 binding site recognize d by several potent, broadly neutralizing antibodies (VRC01, VRC03, b12). Based on the epitopes recognized by the serum samples, we hypothesize that these antibodies may be beneficial to protection. From these data we demonstrate that the addition of SN50 shifts the epitope selectivity in the case of gp120. This may prove valuable with diseases where the current recognized epitopes are not effective enough to provide protection. 64 Figure 2.4. In vivo vaccinations across a broad range of adjuvants.

We stimulated cells with SN50 and LPS (10 ng/mL), CpG (5 \u00b5g/mL), R848 ( 1 \u00b5g/mL) and 65 Pam3CSK4 (100 ng/mL) and compared transcript levels to cells treated with TLR agonist alone (Fig. 2.4a). We chose these TLR agonists because they represent a subset of the compounds with promising potential for commercial use if the inflammato ry side effects can be controlled. In RAW macrophages, we observed downregulation of TNF - and IL -6 pro -inflammatory cytokine transcript levels. Across all agonists, the cell surface receptors CD86 and MHCII transcript levels were upregulated, compared to agonist alone, implying that cellular communication of the APC to the T cell may not be attenuated by the addition of SN50 and subsequent reduction in cytokine production. To examine how this would translate in vivo, we vaccinated mice with CpG (50 \u00b5g), Pam3CSK4 (20 \u00b5g) and R848 (50 \u00b5g) using gp120 as the antigen. We chose to run these adjuvants alongside the most widely employed adjuvant, alum (250 \u00b5g). With CpG, we observed complete elimination of systemic TNF - and IL -6 With R848 saw a significant decrease in systemic cytokines. We hypothesize that SN50 is less effective at decreasing cytokines with R848 due to the low molecular weight of the R848 molecule, enabling more rapid systemic distribution. Alum alone did not evoke a systemic cytokine response and the addition of SN50 did not alter the cytokine profile. The addition of SN50 increased the antibody levels for all adjuvants, including alum, demonstrating the broad potential use of t his system to a large number of immune adjuvants ( Fig. 2.4d). To understand how this effect may translate to human vaccinations, we treated THP -1 monocytes with 1 \u00b5g /mL LPS with or without SN50. Cells treated with SN50 and LPS expressed dramatically lowe r levels of TNF - and IL -6 (Fig. 2.4e, A8). We also observed increased levels 66 of CD40 and CD86 ( Fig. 2.4f, Fig. A8). Additionally, we examined the effects of SN50 on non - human primate rhesus macaque (NHP) primary blood stimulated NHP PBMCs with SN50 and LPS or LPS alone for 6h and analyzed the cell supernatant for pro -inflammatory cytokines. Cells stimulated with LPS demonstrated high levels of TNF - and IL -6 in the cell supernatant, cells with SN50 demonstrated significant reduction in cytokine levels ( Fig. 2.4g). We observed that CD86 expression was upregulated 2 -fold in cells stimulated with SN50 and LPS compared to cells stimulated with LPS alone ( Fig. 2.4h, Fig. A9). This implies that SN50 may wo rk similarly in NHP and humans as it does in mice. 2.3.7 Exploration of the mechanism of action We next wanted to more directly examine how early systemic expression of TNF - and IL-6 impact the immediate inflammatory response and downstream adaptive im mune response. We vaccinated mice with CpG and either TNF - neutralizing antibody (TNF - N) or IL -6 neutralizing antibody (IL -6N) and measured the systemic cytokines ( Fig. 2.5). The CpG + IL -6N group demonstrated a 1.4 -fold decrease in TNF - expression and a complete reduction of systemic IL -6 expression. The CpG + TNF - N group demonstrated complete elimination of systemic TNF - and a 3 -fold reduction of IL -6 expression. This result was confirmed by a control isotype antibody to rule out any nonspeci fic interactions. Although both IL -6N and TNF - N groups demonstrated higher average antibody levels, these differences were not statistically significant ( Fig. 2.5). This indicates that reducing inflammation from CpG with the initial vaccination is not de trimental to antibody production. Initially it may seem surprising that decreasing the excessive systemic inflammatory response leads to a sustained adaptive response, however, adequate immunity to specific diseases has been acquired from a variety of FDA 67 approved immune adjuvants (e.g. alum, MPLA) without unsafe levels of pro -inflammatory cytokines.47,48 Additionally, a variety of studies have demonstrated that physical sequestration of non-approved immune adjuvants by conjugation to antigens49,50, polymer s51,52, phospholipids52,53 or inclusion in particles54 lead to dramatically reduced systemic pro -inflammatory cytokines without negatively affecting the adaptive response. Therefore, it is not entirely surprising that simply limiting excessive systemic inflammation from CpG adjuvanted vaccination (while enabl ing all other signaling) is not detrimental to the downstream adaptive response. 68 Figure 2.5.

To examine this mechanism, we injected SN50 i.m. in the left hind limb and immediately injected CpG + OVA (SN50 L + CpG R) in the right hind limb. The re was no significant difference in systemic cytokine levels tested between CpG and the SN50 L + CpG R group ( Fig. 2.5), whereas SN50 + CpG + OVA (SN50 + CpG) injected simultaneously demonstrated reduction of TNF - and IL -6. On day 28, we analyzed serum antibody concentrations, reveling a 5.5 fold difference between the SN50 + CpG and the SN50 L +CpG R group ( Fig. 2.5). This demonstrates the importance of coadministration of the components and therefore indicates th at SN50 is acting locally to both increase safety and protection. We next wanted to examine how modulating systemic inflammation at early time points alters lymph node cytokine and cell surface expression and resulting cell populations. We injected mice w ith CpG + OVA , CpG + SN50 + OVA or PBS ( Fig. 2.5). At 24 h we harvested the draining inguinal lymph node and analyzed the cells for dendritic cells (CD11c+) positive for TNF - , IL- 6, CD86 and CD40 ( Fig. 2.5, A11). There was no significant difference in C D11c+ populations between CpG and CpG + SN50. On day 10, we examined the draining inguinal lymph node for CD4+, CD8+ and B220+ cells ( Fig. 2.5, A11). There was no significant difference in cell populations between CpG and CpG + SN50. This demonstrates that the addition of SN50 does not detrimentally affect the recruitment of antigen presenting cells or their ability to secrete inflammatory cytokines or express CD86 and CD40 in the lymph node. Additionally, the addition of SN50 does not hamper the recruitmen t of adaptive immune cells. Interestingly, we noticed a distinct decrease in weight of the spleen at both time points when coadministering SN50 ( Fig. 2.5). From these experiments, we conclude that SN50 acts locally at the injection site to inhibit immedi ate cytokine production, containing inflammation before it is distributed systemically. 70 Based on our in vitro data, we believe CpG + SN50 enables TNF - and IL -6 production locally at reduced levels. Our in vitro data suggests that immune cells exposed to CpG + SN50 express higher levels of cell surface receptors important for antigen presentation and effective T cell activation. However, in vivo, dendritic cells demonstrated no change in CD86 or CD40 expression with the addition of SN50. While our experim ents confirm that SN50 reduces systemic inflammation and increases antibody levels in vivo, more in -depth exploration needs to be completed to fully understand the mechanism. 2.4 Conclusion Using a broad range of TLR agonists, we show both in vitro and in vivo that a cell permeable inhibitor of the p50 subunit of NF -B, potentiates the immune response - reducing inflammation while increasing antibody responses. Co -administration of CpG with the immune potentiator results in significantly reduced levels o f proinflammatory cytokines, often at undetectable levels. At the same time, this reduction in inflammation results in a 3 -fold increase in the IgG levels of antibodies for the model antigen OVA. We examined how potentiation would enhance the capabilities of the adjuvants to improve the immune response. In our influenza model we directly examined side effects in response to the current commercial flu vaccine and Fz + CpG and determine that adding SN50 reduces side effects and systemic pro -inflammatory cytok ine levels. We also demonstrate that the safety profile can be enhanced without negatively effecting the protective response. After vaccinated mice were challenged with influenza A, mice with SN50 added to the vaccine, lead to increased survival, less weig ht loss and less change in body temperature. To study the effects of potentiation on TLR agonists as vaccine adjuvants, we selected three diseases - influenza, dengue and HIV - all of which have had different challenges in vaccine development. In dengue vaccination, the goal is to increase antibody neutralization potential while 71 maintaining a safe profile. We demonstrate that there are no detrimental effects to dengue neutralization of antibodies with SN50, enabling us to mitigate side effects but mainta in the protective response. In HIV, we vaccinated with HIV envelope protein gp120, CpG and SN50, increased both IgG and IgA levels. This method appears quite general as it works with many TLR agonists and antigens. Additionally, we demonstrate, for the fi rst time, that directly inhibiting the inflammatory response at the injection site does not negatively affect the adaptive response. SN50 is one of hundreds of similar NF -B inhibitors. When used in combination with the appropriate TLR agonist, many may pr ove useful for eliciting specific and potentially tunable responses for distinct vaccines or immunotherapies. This methodology may find use in reducing the systemic side effects associated with inflammation seen in many adjuvanted vaccines. 21 This method has the potential to enable a variety of PRR agonists to be used safely in vaccines, increasing the diversity of adaptive immune profiles and widening the scope of disease prevention and treatment. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that using a specific NF-B inhibitor in combination with common immune adjuvants can decrease pro -inflammatory cytokine production while boosting cell -surface receptor expression for effective antigen presentation and T cell activation in mouse, human and NHP primary cells. T he use of this inhibitor in vivo completely reduced systemic TNF - and IL -6 to baseline levels while increasing the downstream adaptive humoral response from the vaccination. These phenomena were observed across a broad range of antigens for a variety of pathogens demonstrating that this may prove a general strategy for improving vaccination response while conforming to strict safety standards. There are hundreds of documented immune adjuvants that provide adequate protection against diseases but induce un safe levels of inflammation to be approved for clinical use7,55.7,55 Additionally there are hundreds of NF-B inhibitors, some already with FDA approval, that could be multiplexed with different TLR 72 agonists to provide a broad range of responses.44 We anti cipate this framework will enable a variety of TLR agonists to be used safely in human vaccines, increasing the diversity of adaptive immune profiles and widening the scope of disease prevention and treatment. 2.5 Materials and Methods Study Design: The o verall objective of this study was to investigate the effect of SN50 on early innate immune responses and adaptive immune responses.

All compounds were tested for endotoxin prior to use. All vaccinations were administered intramuscularly in the hind leg. Initial group assignments were assigned to using a computerized randomization procedure based on body weights that produce similar group mean values [ToxData\u00ae version 3.0 (PDS Pathology Data Systems, Inc., Basel, Switzerland)]. Mice were vaccinated by i.m. injection into the hind leg on Days 0 and 21. The vaccine material used in this study i s Fluzone\u00ae quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur). Each 0.5 mL dose of Fluzone\u00ae contains at least 15 g of hemagglutinin (HA) from each of the following four influenza strains recommended for the 2017/2018 influenza season: B/Brisbane/60/2008 -like strain. At least 1 g of each strain was used in vaccination of the mice. Body weights were collected 24 hr, 48 hr and 72 hr post -prime vaccination. Body temperatures were collected 1 hr, 3 hr, 24 hr, 48 hr and 72 hr post -prime vaccination. Blood samples were collected on days 0, 14, 28, 42, 56. Plasma was collected on day 0. Serum was collected on days 14, 28, 52 and 56. Fi ve animals from each group were humanely euthanized on day 14 post -vaccination. Spleens were collected for T cell analysis. On day 43 post - vaccination, all mice were challenged via intranasal route with a lethal dose of A/Michigan/45/2015. The dose level o f challenge virus used was an equivalent of 5 LD50. For inoculation, mice were anesthetized with a ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) mixture. Once anesthetized, 0.025 mL of inoculum was delivered dropwise into the nares. The 79 mouse was held uprigh t to allow the virus to be inhaled thoroughly then returned to its cage. After challenge, body weights and temperature readings were recorded daily through a transponder (BioMedic data systems, Seaford, DE) implanted subcutaneously in each mouse. Animals w ere monitored for morbidity/mortality for 14 days post -infection. Any animals meeting pre -determined moribund criteria (>20% weight loss) were humanely euthanized. Three animals from each group were humanely euthanized on day 3 post -challenge (Day 45) and lungs collected for viral quantitation by plaque assay/TCID50. Tissues for viral titers were weighed then flash frozen in an ethanol/dry ice bath or liquid nitrogen and stored at - 65\u00b0C. Frozen organs were thawed at 37 \u00b0C for 5 min. Once thawed, organs wer e homogenized in MEM 10% w/v using a Bead Ruptor 12 (Omni International, Kennesaw, Georgia) in tubes containing 1.4 mm ceramic beads. Homogenized organs were centrifuged at 2,000 x g for 5 min to remove cellular debris. The resulting supernatant was serial ly diluted 10 -fold then transferred into respective wells of a 96 -well plate containing a monolayer of Madin -Darby Canine Kidney Cells (MDCK) cells The TCID50 assay will be performed. TCID50 titers will be calculated using the method of Reed -Meunch. The remaining 5 mice in each group were monitored for the remaining days of the challenge. Neutralization assays: Serum samples were tested against a representative of each dengue serotype (DENV -1: strain Hawaii; dilution 1:100) then i ncubated with standardized virus concentration of 50 -120 PFU of each strain. The serum:virus mixture was transferred into respective wells of a 96 -well plate which contained a monolayer of Vero 80 cells. The cells were incubated for 40 hours at 37 \u00b0C. After 40 hours of incubation, the cells were fixed with 1.0% PFA and stained by Anti -Flavivirus Group Antigen D1-4G2-4-15 (Millipore (Kirkegaard and Perry MD). Spots were developed using TrueBlue Peroxidase Substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). Plaques were visualized and counted using an ELISPOT instrument. Plaque reduction neutralization test titers (PRNT) were expressed in terms of conventional 50% PRNT end - point titers. T cell analysis: Spleens were harvested from mice as described above at time point indicated. Splenocytes were isolated by pressing spleen fragments through a strainer attached to a 50 -mL conical tube us ing a syringe plunger. Cells were washed through the strainer with PBS and centrifuged at 500 x g for 10 min. Supernatant was aspirated and the pellet was resuspended in (BD Lyse lysing solution) and incubated at 3 7 \u00b0C for 2 minutes. 30 mL of PBS was added and cell suspension was centrifuged at 500 x g for 10 minutes. Supernatant was discarded and cells were resuspended in RPMI containing 10% HIFBS at 2 x 106 cells/ mL. 500 \u00b5L was added to 24 well plate. Cells were incubated with 10 \u00b5g/ mL Influenza A H1N1 (A/Michigan/45/2015) Tag) (SinoBiological). After GolgiStop (BD Biosciences) was added and cells were incubated for 11 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO 2. Cells were centrifuged 500 x g for 1 0 min and stained for CD4/ IL Solution Kit ac cording to manufacter's protocol and analyzed using a NovoCyte flow cytometer (ACEA Biosciences, Inc.). Epitope analysis: Mouse serum was collected as described above and samples were analyzed using Multiwell RepliTope microarray for appropriate antigen (JPT Innovative Peptide Solutions) according to manufacterer's protocol. Briefly, serum samples were dil uted in 3% BSA in 1x TBS - Buffer + 0.1% Tween20 (TBS -T) to a final concentration of 10 \u00b5g/mL. The microarray was fitted with an ArraySlide 24 -4 chamber (JPT Innovative Peptide Solutions) to enable multi -sample analysis. 150 uL diluted serum was added to sam ples wells and incubated for 1h at 30 \u00b0C. Wells were washed 5x with TBS -T. 150 \u00b5L secondary antibody (1 \u00b5g/mL) was added to wells and incubated RT for 1h. Wells were washed 5x with TBS -T and 2x with nanopure water. imaged using a Caliber I.D. RS -G4 confocal microscope and analyzed using ImageJ. Safety and protection score: We assigned a safety score comprised of systemic TNF - , IL-6 levels and weight loss post -vaccination. A score for each TNF - , IL-6 and weight loss was assigned for each mouse. The safety score of a single mouse represents the summation of these individual scores. A protectio n score was assigned based on survival, change in body weight and change in body temperature post -challenge. Scores were determined by dividing values into quartiles, and assigned a number 0 to 4 based on the quartile. Higher values indicate an improved sa fety profile (lower TNF - or IL -6, less weight loss after vaccination) or improved protection (survival, less weight loss, higher body temperature after challenge). 82 Statistics and replicates: Data is plotted and reported in the text as the mean \u00b1 s.e.m. Sample size is as indicated in biological replicates in all in vivo and in vitro experiments. The sample sizes were chosen based on preliminary experiments or literature precedent indicating that the number would be sufficient to detect significant differ ences in mean values should they exist. P values were calculated using a one -way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc test or two -tailed unpaired heteroscedastic t-test where appropriate. All P values and test type for each figure are available in Table S1. All experiments have been repeated (sometimes with minor variations due to reagents and materials) and replication was successful. 2.6 References 1. Petrovsky, N. & Aguilar, J. C.

In the last decade, hundreds of synthetic immune adjuvants have been created , but very few are safe enough to be included in clinical vaccines . Here we present that small molecule NF-B inhibitors can be used to both increase the safety and improve the protective response of vaccination. Additionally, we synthesize a library of derivatives identifying several promising candidates for use in vaccine formu lations . We further demonstrate that the anti -inflammatory action of the NF -B is not coupled to the immune -boosting potential. 3.2 Introduction Vaccines remain one of the most effective ways of preventing disease. Despite their immense success in preventing diseases such as polio, tetanus, and small pox , diseas es such as HIV and dengue present challenges that current clinical vaccine technology cannot provide. To solve this problem, one strategy that has been explored is to include adjuvants, compo nents of a vaccine that enhance the immune response.1 Although adjuvanted vaccines often lead to a higher level and qualit y of immune response that cannot be achieved with current approved adjuvants, to date very few have been approved for use in human vaccines due to the side effects they incur.2-4 We recently reported that vaccines could be imp roved through the use of a peptide NF - B inhibitor, SN50.5 The addition of SN50 to adjuvanted vaccines led to increased safe ty and decreased side effects while enhancing protection against disease. Although this method proved 90 both general across a wide range of adjuvants and effective against antigens of a variety of diseases, large amount of the peptide was required to enable optimal safety and protection. Scale - up of peptides present synthetic challenges and can result in expensive production costs, limiting their use in a clinical setting.6,7 Peptides can also induce an immune response against themselves leading to decreased enhancement in subsequent vaccinations. We chose to explore other sma ll molecule NF -B inhibitors as immune potentiators to overcome these challenges. Here we demonstrate that some small molecule NF - B inhibitors are effective at reducing adjuvant -induced inflammation while also increasing the adaptive immune response. We demonstrate that not all NF -B inhibitors are effective immune potentiators. We found honokiol and capsaicin to be effective at both limiting inflammation and potentiating the adaptive response. Through knockout studies, we demonstrate that the increase in antigen specific antibodies is independent from the anti -inflammatory activity. We explored derivatives of honokiol and found several promising candidates . 3.3 Results and discussion 3.3.1 Exploration of small molecule NF -B inhibitors in vitro To begin exploring alternative NF -B inhibitors we examined the literature for promising candidates. Due to the strong correlation between NF -B activation and sepsis8, cancer9,10 and autoimmune disorders11, a librar y of NF -B inhibitors have been identified.12 We first wanted to analyze the potential of a variety small molecule NF -B inhibitors to inhibit inflammation in vitro in combination with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS), a TLR4 agonist. We chose several common commercially available NF-B inhibitors and tested them in RAW macrophages alongside the most commonly used FDA approved anti -inflammatory drugs 91 acetaminophen and ibuprofen.13,14 We treated RAW macrophages with inhibitors and LPS and assayed the supernatant for IL -6 secretion (Fig 3.1). Figure 3.1 Small molecule inhibitor screen IL-6 Lev els CardamoninCAPEWA in vivo. (A) Systemic TNF - expression 1h post vaccination. (B) Systemic IL -6 expression 1h post -vaccination. (C) Anti -OVA antibody titer 21 days post -vaccination. 3.3.2 Exploration of small molecule NF -B inhibitors in vivo We next wanted to examine how these inhibitors would alter safety and protection in vivo. To test this in vivo, we tested the small molecule inhibitors that were the most effective at inhibiting IL -6 expression in vitro , capsaicin, honokiol and withaferin A and ran them alongside acetaminoph en and ibuprofen. For our in vivo vaccination, we used ovalbumin (OVA) as a model antigen to examine the changes in humoral response. We vaccinated mice with 100 \u00b5g OVA, 50 \u00b5g CpG, and inhibitor. \u00b5g capsaicin or 600 \u00b5g WA. Due to the difficulty in solubility, all inhibitors were suspended in addavax, a squalene -based oil -in-water nano -emulsion, to enable effective vaccine suspensions. We chose to analyze systemic levels of TNF - and IL -6 because high levels of these cytokines are pyrogenic, unsafe and have been correlated with vaccine -related side effects. 15-17 Mice vaccinated with CpG demonstrated high level s of TNF - (1067 pg/mL) (Fig. 3.2a). 93 Addition of an -B inhibitor decreased the level of TNF pg/mL (1.4 honokiol ( fold), capsaicin ( 28 fold to background levels ), and WA by 1.8 fold. The systemic levels of IL -6 were also high with CpG vaccination (941 pg/mL ). The groups that included an NF -B inhibitor did not always decrease the level of IL-6 (Fig. 3.2b). Ibuprofen, acetaminophen and WA did not decrease -6 expression significantly . However , honokiol and capsaicin dramatically reduced the systemic levels of IL -6 to 266 pg/mL (3.5 fold) and 47.4 pg/mL (20 fold), respectively. On day 21, we analyzed the anti -OVA antibody levels ( Fig. 3.2c). CpG was 1.3 fold more than PBS. Ibuprofen and acetaminophen were 3.2 and 2.4 fold lower that CpG alone. CpG + honokiol was 5.3 fold more than CpG alone. CpG + capsaicin was 3.5 fold higher than CpG alone. CpG + WA was 1.5 fold lower than CpG alone. 3.3.3. Dose -dependenc e of capsaicin and honokiol Capsaicin and honokiol demonstrated exceptional promise in these studies so we wanted to examine them further. We wanted to understand how changing the dose would alter innate and adaptive immune responses. For honokiol, we test ed a concentration 2 -fold higher (800 \u00b5g) and 2- fold lower (200 \u00b5g). High concentrations of capsaicin can induce side effects from systemic activation of TRPV1. We wanted to examine if we could lower the dose, but maintain adequate anti-inflammatory activ ity and antibody boosting potential. We chose to test a dose 4 - fold lower (5 \u00b5g) and 20 - fold lower (1 \u00b5g). All doses of honokiol demonstrated a significant decrease in TNF - expression compared to CpG alone, however there was no significant difference b etween the different doses. Capsaicin decreased TNF - levels significantly across all doses compared to CpG alone and 5 \u00b5g and 20 \u00b5g decreased levels of TNF - significantly more than 1 \u00b5g (Fig. 94 3.3a). The level of IL -6 was only decreased with 400 \u00b5g and 800 \u00b5g and 20 \u00b5g capsaicin ( Fig. 3.3b). Twenty -one days later, we analyzed differences in anti -OVA antibody titer and found that all doses of honokiol increased levels of anti -OVA antibodies compared to CpG alone and the highest level was found with 400 \u00b5g honokiol ( Fig. 3.3c). 1 ug and 5 \u00b5g of capsaicin did not change level of anti -OVA antibodies in the serum compared to CpG alone, however 20 \u00b5g significantly increased serum levels. Figure 3.3. Dose effects of honokiol and capsaicin. (A) Systemic TNF - levels 1h post vaccination. (B) Systemic IL -6 levels 1h post -vaccination. (C) Anti -OVA antibody levels 21 days post -vaccination. 3.3.4 Determining the TRPV1 -mediated effects of capsaicin The main in vivo target for capsaicin is the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1). TRPV1 is known to modulate the immune response in a variety of ways, and importantly, has been implicated in dampening systemic inflammation associated wi th sepsis.18-22 However, it has never been explored in a vaccine setting. To understand how activation of TRPV1 may be modulating the effects of the adjuvant, we compared the immediate inflammatory response of the vaccination in wild type mice (WT) and 95 TRPV1 knockout mice. We vaccinated WT and TRPV1 KO mice with 100 \u00b5g OVA and: 50 \u00b5g CpG, 50 \u00b5g CpG + 20 \u00b5g capsaicin or PBS. We analyzed systemic levels of TNF - and IL -6 1h after vaccination. We found that CpG induced high levels of TNF - and IL -6 in both WT and TRPV1 KO mice. Addition of capsaicin dramatically and significantly reduced both TNF - levels and IL -6 levels in the WT mice ( Fig. 3.4a, 3.4b). Although the mean was slightly lower for both TNF - and IL -6 in the TRPV1 KO mice, these differences were not statistically significant. This demonstrates that TRPV1 activation is responsible for the capsaicin -induced decrease in systemic cytokine levels. To examine if the increased antibody titer was due to TRPV1 activation on day 21, we analyzed levels of an ti-OVA antibodies in the serum (Fig. 3.4c). Interestingly, we found that anti -OVA antibody titers were increased in groups with Capsaicin + CpG in both WT and KO mice. This implies that the antibody -boosting activity of capsaicin is separate from TRPV1 -dependent decrease in inflammatory cytokines. This result demonstrates both that the decrease in inflammation is not responsible for the antibody -boosting activity of the NF -kB inhibitor a result that we demonstrated previously,5 and also that the enhancement of the adaptive response is TRPV1 independent. 96 Figure 3.4.

Right axis, blue. 3.3.5 Synthesis of honokiol derivative library To further explore honokiol, we synthesized a library of derivatives. Honokiol derivative libraries have been synthesized previously and examined for their effects on neuroprotection23, antimicrobial agents24 and anti -cancer25 among others.26,27 However, to date no such study has examined the effects of honokiol analogs on vaccines or anti-inflammatory activity and antig en presenting ability. Phenylphenols and biphenols were prepared using Pd-catalyzed Suzuki coupling using corresponding iodophenols and hydroxyphenylboronoic acids as starting materials. These compounds were O-allylated using allylBr. Resulting compounds were subjected to Claisen rearrangement using diethyl aluminum chloride to yield a variety of ring substitutions ( Scheme 1 ). 97 Scheme 1. Honokiol derivative synthesis. We analyzed how the honokiol derivatives altered IL -6 production in RAW macrophages. We chose to analyze the hydroxybiphenyls and O-allylated derivatives in addition to the product from the Claisen rearrangement to understand how these functional groups pl ay a role in the anti -inflammatory action or increase in adaptive immune response (Fig. 3.5 a). We treated RAW macrophages with honokiol derivatives and LPS and analyzed IL -6 expression. The addition of LPS alone without a honokiol derivative gave high leve ls of IL -6 expression (5200 pg/mL ). The addition of honokiol, made the IL -6 levels non -detectable. Several derivatives including: 9, 11, 20, 29b, 58a and 58d also demonstrated non -detectable levels of IL - 6 expression. We are currently assessing the impact of the derivatives on CD86 and CD40 cell surface receptor expression and plan to test the most promising candidates in vivo. 98 Figure 3.5 Honokiol derivatives and their inhibitory activity on IL -6 expression . (A) Structures of honokiol derivatives. (B) IL -6 expression of RAW macrophages treated with honokiol derivatives and LPS. 99 3.4 Conclusion In summary, we present that some small molecule inhibitors of NF -B can be used to decrease the inflammatory effects of adjuvanted vaccination potentially enabling safer vaccination while also acting as immune potentiators and increasing the antibody titer. We identified two such immune potentiators, honokiol and capsaic in that effectively decrease inflammation while increasing the adaptive response. We additionally provide evidence that implies that the decrease in inflammation is separate from the increase in antibody response, potentially enabling distinct tunability o f either response. This study also identifies that not just any NF -kB inhibitor can be used to the same effect enabling further modulation of the immune response. We further examined a library of honokiol derivatives and found that several honokiol deriva tives are prom ising candidates to test in vivo . In conclusion, we have demonstrated that using small molecule NF -B inhibitors in combination with common immune adjuvants can decrease pro -inflammatory cytokine production while boosting antibody titers. 3.5 Materials and methods In vitro assays RAW macrophage cytokine analysis : RAW 264.7 macrophages were passaged and plated in a cell culture treated 12 - well plate at 0.5 x106 cells/ well in 1 mL DMEM containing 10% FBS.

Sci. Eng., 3 (2), 206 -213, 2017 4.1 Summary In the study of host -pathogen interactions, vaccines and drug delivery, particulate delivery system are widely used to mimic pathogen size, pattern recognition receptor agonist presentation, and target cells or organs. However, some of the polymeric system s used in particulate delivery have inherent inflammatory properties that are variable and non -specific. These properties enhance their adjuvant activity, but confound the analysis of signaling mechanisms. Here, we present a method for particle coating wi th minimal background immune activation via passivation of the surface with silica -silane. We show herein that a silica -silane shell passivates polymer particles rendering them inert to activation of innate immune cells. The method is broadly applicable an d can be used to coat polymeric particles of many different compositions. This method of silica -silane coating also allows conjugation of amine -bearing agonists and provides for controlled variation of agonist loading. Finally, we demonstrate our particles maintain and enhance qualities of known pathogens making this a potentially general method for improving immune agonist activity. 4.2 Introduction To better understand vaccines and immunotherapies, many researchers are elucidating the mechanisms by wh ich the innate immune system responds to bacterial pathogens.1a-e Our group, and many others, are interested in how micron -sized pathogens stimulate multiple innate immune 107 receptors to elicit protective responses.2a-p In our own work, we employed the curre nt methods used in many studies to conjugate pattern recognition receptor agonists to commercial polystyrene particles to study these processes.2a-p However, as others have reported, naked polystyrene has an inherent, non -specific background activation of innate immune cells, convoluting the results.3a-i Indeed, innate immune activation has been a recurring problem for many nanoscale materials, highlighting the need for inert particles and coatings.3a-i For us, it was difficult to differentiate the signal o f the polystyrene particle from its conjugated agonists. Here we present a coating method for polymeric particles that reduces the background inflammatory response caused by nanoparticles while providing a chemical handle for conjugation of immune agonists . In addition, this coating is more \"cell -like\", overcoming the intrinsic hydrophobicity of polystyrene, allowing the particles to be more uniformly dispersed in aqueous solutions without surfactant stabilization. This method provides a general route for r esearchers attempting to reduce non -specific nanoparticle inflammatory properties and will find use in studies of the innate immune system. Particles with this coating will allow researchers to analyze responses solely from the agonists while mimicking the size and agonist presentation of a pathogen. 4.3 Design of polymeric delivery system In designing an improved polymeric delivery system, we sought a general design strategy that would apply to different polymeric particles for both cellular and in vivo applications. Our design was guided by three main principles: low immunogenicity, ease of functionalization and pathogen mimicry. We further showed that this shell formation technique is generalizable to multiple polymeric cores ( Fig. 4.1). 108 Figure 4.1. Schematic of cellular outcomes of particle exposure. Coated polystyrene particles alone do not elicit an immune response (top left). Agonist -functionalized coated polystyrene particles activate the cell's immune response based on the agonists loaded on the surface (top right), whereas polystyrene particles cause nonspecific activation of immune cells (bottom). APC: Antigen -presenting cell. 4.4 Results and Discussion 4.4.1 Synthesis of coated polystyrene particles We hypothesized that if the particles had a more biologically -relevant surface potential it would reduce immunogenicity. To create a test particle, we synthesized monodisperse polystyrene (PS) particles.4 This synthesis was accomplished by first dissolving purified styrene monomer and poly(vinylpy rrolidone) MW 40,000 in ethanol and purging with dry nitrogen for 1 h. The addition of the poly(vinylpyrrolidone) increased the viscosity of the monomer solution. The stir rate was adjusted to 200 rpm to promote the formation of micron -sized particles. Polymerization was initiated by the addition of 1 wt% AIBN, and the mixture was stirred at 70 \u00b0C for 24 h. To remove unreacted material, we centrifuged the reaction mixture and washed the 109 pellet three times with ethanol. We next screened conditions to synthesize a uniform tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) -mercaptosilane copolymer shell. This judicious choice urface of the particles. The succinimidyl ester moiety on the crosslinker allowed us to attach agonists containing an amine handle. We found that optimal coatings were achieved using an emulsion polymerization approach.5 In a representative coating procedu re used for all core particle types, a flask was charged with cyclohexane, n-hexanol, water, Triton X -114, and sonicated for 20 min. To this emulsion, uncoated particles were added, and the resulting mixture was sonicated for an additional 40 min to increa se particle suspension. TEOS was added dropwise followed by 14 M ammonia solution and the mixture stirred for 30 min. 3 -Mercaptosilane was then added, and the reaction mixture stirred for 6 h. The mixture was centrifuged and then washed three times with et hanol to provide silica -silane coated microparticles. The particles were characterized by a combination of light microscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy - dispersive X -ray spectroscopy (EDS) . SEM analysis confirmed the coated particles retained relative size dispersities ( Fig. 4.2a and Fig. C1-C24). High -resolution SEM analysis of the particle surface suggested that the coating was established by a Pickering -type emulsion process.6 4.4.2 Physi cal properties of coated microparticles Before testing the immune activity of the particles, we assayed the physical properties of the coated particles. Using light microscopy, we examined particle morphology and bulk solution behavior ( Fig. 4.2 and Fig. 4.3). The particles were dispersed in ethanol to provide similar suspension and sedimentation rates across different particle types ( Fig. 4.2b). 110 Figure 4.2. Microscopy of particles . A) Scanning electron microscopy of PS coat particle at 1,677x; 80,000x; and 500,000x magnification (left to right). B) Brightfield microscopy of dispersions of uncoated and coated particles in ethanol to give accurate representations of particle size and f eatures. Aggregation in ethanol does not reflect aggregation in aqueous solutions. We also examined dispersions of PS and coated PS particles (PS coat) in an aqueous medium, which is more relevant for biological studies. We determined that coated PS was m ore uniformly dispersed in aqueous solution (cell culture media) than PS ( Fig. 4.3). 111 Figure 4.3. Light microscopy of particles in media. Microscopy of dispersions of PS and PS coat particles in cell culture media, demonstrating the clumping behavior of the PS particles. Clumps are denoted by dotted outlines. 4.4.3 Immune response to core -shell constructs After validating uniform coating of the particles in the TEOS -mercaptosilane copolymer, we tested the immunogenicity of the particles coated with only the copolymer (before treatment with crosslinker or agonist) and compared it to their uncoated equivalents. To determine activity, we employed the transgenic RAW macrophage RAW -Blue NF -B reporter cell colorimetric readout of NF -B activity.7a-d This cell line is commonly used as an assay for immunogenicity due to the central role of the transcription factor NF -B in immune activation and cytokine production. NF -B is a central transcription factor in immune response specifically the inflammatory response associated with innate immunity. We observed a dramatic and significant difference between PS and coated PS particles. To demonstrate generality, we also tested c oated Fig. 4.4). All TEOS -mercaptosilane coated particles showed a significant reduction in NF -B activity compared to their uncoated equivalents in all polymers except PE. Both coated PLGA and PMMA particles showed no significant difference in NF -B 112 activity compared to cells with no particles added (PBS) demonstrating that the coating passivates immune activation. Figure 4.4. NF -B activity of coated and uncoated particles. Blue bars: uncoated particles. Purple bars: particles with TEOS -mercaptosilane coating. RAW macrophages were stimulated for 18 h with coated or uncoated particles at 1:1 stoichiometry of particles to cells and 0.05, **p < 0.01. To further test the ability of the coating to passivate the immunogenicity of the pol ymer surface, we also tested immunogenicity in THP -1 cells (human APCs) by observing IL -1 secretion ( Fig. 4.5). IL-1 is a common inflammatory cytokine observed with nanoparticles.12a-c We found that the coating decreased IL -1 expression in all cases except PE which we believe is due to the low 113 immunogenicity of uncoated PE. Further we found a statistically significant difference between PS and PS coat and PMMA and PMMA coat this reinfo rces our findings from the NF-B assay . IL-1 expression TEOS -mercaptosilane coating. THP -1 cells were stimulated for 18 h with coated or uncoated particles at 1:1 stoichiometry of particles to cells and then assayed activity. 0.05, **p < 0.01. For further studies we focused on polystyrene particles because they are extremely uniform in size and we intend to use them in future applications. To explore how the coating affects immune 114 signaling and downstream effects, we performed a quantitative PCR analysis of key immune genes. This assay allowed us to monitor the expression levels of inflammatory markers and cell surface receptors involved in the innate immune response. We included TLR2 and TLR9 in our assay, as these are the target receptors for o ur model agonists. Changes in expression levels of these receptors from the particle itself would confound results in future experiments. We found that important immune players: CD4, TLR9, MyD88, TLR2 and TNF - were upregulated in response to stimulation f rom PS particles. The coated particles did not demonstrate this degree of immunogenicity ( Table 4.1). Table 4.1. qPCR panel of immune genes. RAW macrophages were stimulated for 4 h with PS or PS coat particles at 1:1 stoichiometry of particles to cells and then assayed. Values shown are fold change over unstimulated cells. Red, grey, and green signify upregulation, no change, and down regulation, respectively. Statistical significance between PS and PS coat values: CD4 0.01, ***p<0.001. 115 4.4.4 Agonist loading After demonstrating the improved immune compatibility of our TEOS -mercaptosilane copolymer coating, we wanted to ascertain if the particles could be loaded with ago nists. The TLR9 agonist CpG -1826 was used as a model because an amine -bearing, highly fluorescent version is available that retains robust bioactivity.7 Uniform labeling of the core -shell particles was accomplished via treatment with a heterobifunctional crosslinker and subsequent conjugation with a fluorophore -labeled immune agonist. Due to the wide availability of amine -functionalized immune agonists, we selected a cross -linker with -PEG 6-NHS. poly(ethylene arm to optimize agonist presentation. Additionally, the maleimide was used to link the crosslinker to the free thiols derived from the mercaptosilane functionalization on the particle. To control agonist l oading we varied the concentration of the crosslinked particles in a solution of FAM -CpG -NH 2 (Fig. 4.6a). Flow cytometry indicated a shift in median fluorescence corresponding to an increase in the amount of FAM -CpG per particle ( Fig. 4.6b) demonstrating the ability to dose the particle with varying amounts of agonist. Using a colorimetric readout of NF-B, we determined that NF -B activity increased with increasing agonist loading on the particles ( Fig. 4.6c). Similarly, we increased the stoichiometry of particles to cells and observed an increase in the overall NF -B activity. To demonstrate the generality of this method, we loaded the particles with lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a TLR2 agonist.8 Our results indicated that the increased LTA loading corresponde d with increased NF -B activation. Confocal microscopy of the particle bearing cells confirmed that they were internalized ( Fig. 4.7b and c ). 116 Figure 4.6. Cell activation and endocytosis of coated and uncoated particles. A) Flow cytometry analysis of PS coat particles loaded with increasing amounts of FAM -CpG from 0.012 \u00b5g/\u00b5L to 1.2 RAW -Blue NF -B activity assay. High, med and low refer to the concentration of fr ee agonist in the PS coat particle loading reaction (1.2 , 0.12 and 0.012 \u00b5g/\u00b5L CpG, respectively and 20, 2 and 0.2 \u00b5g/mL LTA, respectively). Ratios refer to stoichiometry of particles to cells. Differences in uptake were observed between PS particle and c oated PS particles. Macrophages exposed to coated PS particles display internalization, while PS particles remain un-internalized ( Fig. 4.7a). Further differences were observed in the aggregation of the two particle types. PS particles tend to form large, aggregated clumps while the coated PS particles 117 are more evenly suspended throughout the medium ( Fig. 4.7b and c ). The aggregates in the PS - CpG varied in size, including some extremely large aggregates approximately 70 \u00b5m in diameter (Fig. C25), lowering t he effective concentration of the particles. These results indicate that the coated particles provide a more uniform bioavailability providing better control of agonist dosing. 118 Figure 4.7. Cell internalization of particles. A) Schematic of particle internalization. B) Confocal (63x magnification) of RAW macrophages incubated with PS -CpG (top) or PS coat -CpG (bottom) for 4 h.

Scale bar: 100 \u00b5m. 119 4.4.5 Biomimimetic Nature of Core -Shell Particles To study the biomimetic nature of our particles, we first examined the zeta potential of coated and uncoated particles. We found that coating the particles decreased the zeta potential by -1.2 to -20.8 mV compared to their uncoated precursors ( Table C1). This negative zeta potential confers several benefits to the coated particle including: (1) reduced clumping, which increases particle dosing consistency, and (2) surface potential similar to both mammalian cells ( -19.4 mV) and bacteria ( -21.9 mV). 9,10 We hypothesized that these advantages would increase the immune cell uptake of the particles. To test this hypothesis, we devised a cellular uptake experiment. We incubated RAW 264.7 macrophages with fluorescein -labeled PS, coated fluorescein PS, commercially Fluor\u00ae 488 -labeled, heat -inactivated E.coli at 1:1 stoichiometry of particles to cells. After 4 h, we examined the fluorescence of the RAW cells using flow cytometry ( Fig. 4.8). We found that 1.8% of cells treated with labele d PS particles took up the particles. In contrast, 44.0% of cells showed uptake of the coated fluorescein -labeled PS particles. Further, 98.5% of cells displayed uptake of the labeled E. coli. These results showed that the uptake profile of the coated PS p articles is increased compared to that of the PS particle, and therefore, closer to that of the pathogenic E. coli or a mammalian cell. We hypothesize that the reason for the lowered uptake of the coated PS particles in contrast to E. coli is due to the presence of TLR agonists on the surface of the E. coli that induce endocytosis in immune cells.11a-d In order to assay the ability of our particles to recreate a pathogenic insult, we incubated RAW 264.7 cells with CpG -loaded particles. We compared coated P S particles functionalized with FAM -CpG, commercially available amine -modified PS particles that we functionalized 120 with CpG, and Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 -labeled, heat -inactivated E.coli ( Fig. 4.8). Cells were incubated with particles or E. coli for 4 h at a ratio of one particle or E. coli to one cell. We found that 3.7% of cells incubated with PS -CpG particles successfully internalized the particles. In contrast, 52.1% of cells incubated with coated PS -CpG particles displayed fluorescence, indicating successful u ptake of the particles. This compares favorably with the fluorescent E.coli which had uptake by 98.5% of the cells. We hypothesize that the coated polymer had more uptake because the zeta potential is closer to that of E. coli or a mammalian cell. Addition ally, PS particles are hydrophobic and prone to clumping, lowering the effective concentration. E.coli have an additional advantage over the coated PS -CpG particles in that they display many different TLR agonists which activate the cells - potential ly increasing uptake. 11a-d 121 Figure 4.8. Cell uptake of particles. Flow cytometry plots of unstained cells, PS particle, PS coat particle and fluorescent bacteria (top to bottom). After sorting, the cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy ( Fig. 4.9). The microscopy of the cells sorted for the FITC or AlexaFluor488 marker showed punctate green fluorescence on 122 the interior of the cells indicating uptake of the particles or bacteria. Enough cells for microscopy was only obtained for cells incubated wi th PS coat, PS coat - CpG and fluorescent E.coli. This is due to the low percentage of cells positive for uptake of PS or PS -CpG particles. Figure 4.9. Fluorescence microscopy of sorted cells . Cells FACS sorted for green fluorescence demonstrate the presence of particle puncta. 123 4.5 Conclusion Particulate forms of polystyrene and other common delivery polymers non -specifically activate the immune system to varying degrees, while limiting the amount of particulate matter that is internalized. To incorporate these useful polymers into tools to stu dy the immune system, we developed a method to passivate their surface. This technique provides a significant decrease in the immunogenicity of common polymer particles. We further showed that this easy and scalable coating technique can be applied to many polymeric particles conferring them with the same useful qualities, including ease of crosslinking and agonist loading, uniform dispersion in aqueous solutions, and increased cellular uptake. The coated particles display surface properties closely resembl ing that of a pathogen, opening new avenues for study of the innate immune system and adjuvant development. 4.6 Materials and Methods 5'-FAM -TCCATGACGTTCCTGACGTT -3'-NH 2 (FAM -CpG -amino) was purchased from IDT.

Biol. 12(2), 347 -350, 2017 5.1 Summary Few tools exist to directly examine spatial and temporal elements of immune activation. To elucid ate the spatiotemporal aspects of innate immune responses, we designed an optogenetic pattern recognition receptor that activates in response to blue light. We demonstrate direct receptor activation, leading to control of downstream signaling pathways in a variety of relevant cell types and labeling of activated cells via a split fluorescent reporter. 5.2 Introduction There is a common element in both preventing disease through vaccination and the chronic inflammation of autoimmune diseases - activation of the innate immune system by Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs).1 These recognition events are position and time -dependent, leading to robust protection from disease in some cases and autoimmune disorders in others. The spatiotemporal sequence of activati on and its cellular context determines the type and magnitude of the immune response.2,3 Despite the importance of understanding the pattern of receptor signaling, few spatial or temporal techniques exist to control PRR activation. In the field of neurobiology, light with its exquisite spatiotemporal precision, has helped determine how comple x networks of cells enact unique signaling mechanisms.4 Recently, we reported the use of photoactivated Toll -like receptor agonists to control temporal activation of innate immune receptors.5-7 However, spatial control using such technologies is limited by the available 135 synthetic tools and the challenge of receptor activity and diverse location of immune cells within an organism. Here we show a genetically encoded, photoactivated PRR that allows light - mediated control of innate immune signaling. The engineered receptor is a fusion of the light -activated cryptochrome system, CRY2/CIB1, and the cytosolic pattern recognition receptor DAI (DNA -dependent activator of IFN -regulatory factors). This genetic fusion rende rs the DAI receptor inducible via dimerization by blue light. Genetic encoding allows the receptor to be expressed selectively within a designated cell type and to originate the signal only from selected cells. We show that the receptor activates cellular markers of innate immunity within 2 hours of blue light exposure. Additionally, the system reports which cells have been activated using dimerization via a split -fluorescence reporter assay. The light -activated receptor was inserted into multiple cell typ es including RAW macrophages and HEK293. A genetically encoded, light -activated innate immune receptor will enable unprecedented control and analysis of complex innate immune interactions potentially including wound healing and paracrine signaling effects. Figure 5.1. Schematic of photo -DAI activation. To achieve photoactivation, the CRY2/CIB1 domains are fused to one of two split domains of mCherry and identical copies of the DNA - dependent activator of IFN -regulatory factors(DAI) receptor. Activation with blue light (470 nm) induces dimerization of CRY2/CIB1, DAI, and subsequent fluorescence from the coupled mCherry. The photo -DAI enacts the transcr iption of interferons activating the innate immune system. 136 5.3 Results and Discussion 5.3.1 Design of Photoactivated receptor In designing a photoactivated receptor, we sought to apply a general design strategy that would work for many different innate immune receptors. As most PRRs use dimerization to control signaling, light-induced dimerizatio n would yield a general method to gain light -mediated control of innate immune receptors.2,7,8 We chose the DAI receptor as a proof -of- concept effector module due to its convenient properties for protein engineering as well as a precedent for genetic manipulation and controlled dimerization resulting in controlled activation.9 DAI is a cytosolic PR R that homodimerizes upon binding dsDNA, activating the NF - B and IRF3 pathways.9 Engineered DAI activated IFN pathways in response to chemical dimerization by a rapamycin derivative, making this receptor a promising candidate for light - induced dimerizati on.9 CRY2 (cryptochrome 2) and its binding partner CIB1 (cryptochrome interacting basic helix -loop-helix 1) are a robust blue light -induced dimerization system used in many mammalian cells.10-12 To minimize the increased molecular weight, we used the CRY2 PHR subconstruct, which is sufficient to induce dimerization. Lacking nuclear import capability, it would maintain the CRY2 -DAI fusion protein in the desired cytoplasmic compartment.10 The C - Figure 5.2. Photo -DAI activity in HEK Blue cells.

We transfected HEK -Blue TLR4 cells with photo -DAI constructs ( Fig. 5.1). Cells were subjected to 470 -490 nm light for 2 hours (1.5 W/m2) and activation wa s measured using a colorimetric assay detecting NF -B activity. NF -B is an important transcription factor in immune activation and results in an upregulation of cytokines, chemokines and cell surface receptors - alerting the immune system of potential pathogen invasion.19 Cells containing photo - DAI showed higher NF -B activation than untransfected cells ( Fig. 5.2, Fig. D1). Constructs Figure 5.3. Fluorescent reporting of dimerization from cells expressing photo -DAI. A: Flow cytometry of HEK cells expressing photo -DAI after 2 h of exposure to either blue light or the native DAI agonist (100 ng/mL Poly(dA:dT)). Cells incubated for 2 h in the dark (black), with Poly(dA:dT)(red), or with blue light (blue). B: Cells expressing photo -DAI exposed to eithe r blue light or Poly(dA:dT) for 4h.

Bottom: 2h blue light exposure. 138 fused to split -mCherry (Photo -DAI), a common label for BiFC14, showed a larger fold -change between illuminate d and dark states, demonstrating light -mediated control of activation. To validate that dimerization was occurring in response to blue light and that the BiFC would mark immune activation, we examined the fluorescence from the photo -DAI system using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy ( Fig. 5.3, Fig. D2). After 2 h of either blue light exposure or exposure to the native DAI agonist, 100 ng/mL Poly(dA:dT), cells began to show a shift in red fluorescence (Fig. 5.3a). After 4 h of exposure to either blue light or native agonist, cells began to show a dramatic shift in fluorescence ( Fig. 5.3b). In addition to activation and fluorescence of mCherry, we observed a light-mediated temporal element to the dimeriz ation of the receptor ( Fig. 5.3c). Blue light stimulation for 2 h elicited red fluorescence in 25% of transfected cells. Within 4 h of stimulation, 84% of cells expressing photo -DAI displayed mCherry fluorescence. In contrast, the native ligand for DAI, 10 0 ng/mL Poly(dA:dT), stimulated only 42% of transfected cells with two distinct populations of cells remaining after 4 h of agonist exposure ( Fig. 5.3a-c). In addition, untransfected cells exposed to blue light for 2 h or 4 h demonstrated no significant change in fluorescence ( Fig. 5.3d). To determine whether activated cells could be tracked, we imaged cells transfected with photo -DAI after 2 h blue light exposure. Cells incubated i n the dark demonstrated a low level of Figure 5.4.

For reporting on the broad set of different immune cells, we tested if this receptor would function in other c ell types. Beyond the initial HEK cells, we also examined the ability of photo - DAI to activate IRF3 signaling in RAW macrophages ( Fig. 5.4). IRF3 is an important transcription factor activated in response to viruses and upregulates cytokines and chemokines involved in an antiviral immune response.18 Accordingly, RAW cells were transduced with either the full photo -DAI system or the CRY2 PHR or CIB1 half of the photo -DAI system using a lentiviral vector. Transduced cells were irradiated with blue light for 2 h or 4 h, alongside a control plate that remained in the dark. The activity of cells expressing photo -DAI corresponded to the exposure time of blue light. Cells expressing mCherry -CRY2 -DAI also showed a modest light-mediated response due to the propensity for light -activated CRY2 to self -oligomerize10, although the activation was less than that of the full photo -DAI system - indicating that both dimerization partners are necessary for maximum DAI activity. 5.4 Conclusion We have created an optogenetic DAI receptor via genetic fusion to a protein pair capable of undergoing photo -induced dimerization. Our engineered receptor activates NF - and IRF3 nuclear translocation in response to blue light stimulation. By fusing a split fluorescent reporter to this complex, cells containing the dimerized receptor can be identified. This method can be widely applied to a variety of innate immune recept ors and their downstream pathways. This method could be applied in vivo to examine the effects of spatial and temporal induction of 140 inflammation, providing useful information for understanding its effects on vaccination, diabetes, arthritis, and developmen t. 5.5 Materials and Methods Plasmid Construction : Linearized DNA was obtained by a standard Q5 HotStart PCR protocol and the following PCR conditions: initial denaturation (98 \u00b0C, 30 sec), 27 cycles (98 \u00b0C, 10 sec; appropriate T m, 30 sec; 72 \u00b0C 30 sec kb-1), final extension (72 \u00b0C, 2 min) in a BioRad C1000 thermocycler.
