ABSTRACT Background Chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are serious conditions in which patients are predispose dt ov i r a l and bacterial infections resulting in potentially fatal acute exacerbations. COPD is dened as a lung disease characterised b y obstruction to lung airflow that interferes with normal breathing. Antib iotic therapy has not been particularly useful in eradicating bacteria such as non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) because they are naturally occurring flora of the upper res piratory tract in many people. However, they can cause opportunistic infection. An oral NTHi v accine has been developed to protect against recurrent infective acute exacerbations in chronic bronchitis. Objectives T o assess the effectiveness of an oral, whole-cell, non-typeabl eH. influenzae (NTHi) vaccine in protecting against recurrent episodes of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and COPD in adults. T o assess the effectiveness of NTHi vaccine in reducing NTHi colonising the respiratory tract during recurrent episodes of acute exacerbations of COPD. Search methods We searched the following databases: CENTRAL (2014, Issue 6), M EDLINE (1946 to July week 3, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to July 2014), CINAHL (1981 to July 2014), LILACS (1982 to July 2014) and W eb of Science (1955 to July 2014). We also searched trials registries and contacted authors of trials requesting unpubl ished data. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials comparing the effects of an oral monobacterial NTHi vaccine in adults with recurrent acu te exacerbations of chronic bronchitis or COPD when there was over t matching of the vaccine and placebo groups on clinical grounds. The selection criteria considered populations aged less than 6 5 years and those older than 65 years. 1 Haemophilus influenzae oral vaccination for preventing acute exacerbations of chr onic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Data collection and analysis T wo authors independently assessed trial quality and extra cted data from original records and publications for incidence an ds e v e r i t y of bronchitis episodes and carriage rate of NTHi measured in th e upper respiratory tract, as well as data relevant to other pr imary and secondary outcomes. Main results We identied six placebo-controlled randomised controlled tri als with a total of 557 participants. They investigated the ef cacy of enteric-coated, killed preparations of H. influenzae in populations prone to recurrent acute exacerbations of chroni c bronchitis or COPD. The vaccine preparation and immunisation regime in all t rials consisted of at least three courses of formalin-killed H. influenzae in enteric-coated tablets taken at intervals (for example, days 0, 28 and 56). Each course generally consisted of two tablets take na f t e r breakfast over three consecutive days. In all cases the placebo g roups took enteric-coated tablets containing glucose. Risk of bi as was moderate across the studies, namely due to the lack of informat ion provided about methods and inadequate presentation of r esults. Meta-analysis of the oral NTHi vaccine showed a small, non-stati stically signicant reduction in the incidence of acute exacerbati ons of chronic bronchitis or COPD by 2.048% (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% condence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.12, P value = 0.68). There was no signicant difference in mortality rate between the vacci ne and placebo groups (odds ratio (OR) 1.62, 95% CI 0.63 to 4.12, P value = 0.31). We were unable to meta-analyse the carriage levels of NTHi in pa rticipants as each trial reported this result using different units and tools of measurement. Four trials showed no signicant diffe rence in carriage levels, while two trials showed a signicant d ecrease in carriage levels in the vaccinated group compared with placebo. Four trials assessed severity of exacerbations measured by r equirement for antibiotics. Three of these trials were compar able and when meta-analysed showed a statistically signicant 80% increase i n antibiotic courses per person in the placebo group (RR 1.81, 95 %C I 1.35 to 2.44, P value < 0.0001). There was no signicant differe nce between the groups with regards to hospital admission rat es (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.13 to 7.04, P value = 0.97). Adverse events were r eported in all six trials with a point estimate suggestive th at they occurred more frequently in the vaccine group, however, this res ult was not statistically signicant (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.9 2, P value = 0.87). Quality of life was not meta-analysed but was rep orted in two trials, with results at six months showing an imp rovement in quality of life in the vaccinated group (scoring at least two po ints better than placebo). Authors' conclusions Analyses demonstrate that NTHi oral vaccination of patients w ith recurrent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis or COPD does n ot yield a signicant reduction in the number and severity of exace rbations. Evidence is mixed and the individual trials that sh ow a signicant benet of the vaccine are too small to advocate widesp read oral vaccination of people with COPD. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY Haemophilus influenzae oral vaccination for preventing acute exacerbations of chr onic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of a non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae ) (NTHi) vaccine in preventing repeated H. influenzae infections in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disea se (COPD) or chronic bronchitis. Background People with COPD can often have frequent infections that worse n symptoms of their lung disease, that is increased breathles sness, purulent discharge and decompensating oxygen saturations le vels, known as an 'acute exacerbation'. The most common bacteria that causes this is H. influenzae ; it can lead to hospitalisation and sometimes death. If these infections can be prevented with a vaccine, people with COPD may have improved outcomes compared to the curr ent practice of treating infections as they arise. Study characteristics The evidence is current to July 2014. We identied six studies w ith 557 participants. The studies were blinded, placebo-contro lled randomised trials that tested how effective the NTHi vaccine is in preventing infections in people aged over 18 years with COP Do r 2 Haemophilus influenzae oral vaccination for preventing acute exacerbations of chr onic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.chronic bronchitis. In all six trials, both the vaccine and placeb o group were given at least three courses of tablets at regular intervals over a period of three to 12 months. Generally the baseline de mographics of participants across the included studies shared s imilar characteristics (such as diet, lifestyle and living conditions) t o other high-income countries. Ages ranged between 40 and 80 yea rs. The studies counted the number of infections the participants expe rienced, levels of respiratory tract bacteria, deaths, side ef fects, hospital admissions or treatment with antibiotics. Key results The NTHi vaccine has no signicant impact on reducing the number of infections COPD patients experience. There was no signicant difference in mortality rate between the vaccine and placebo gro ups and the reported deaths in the vaccinated group were not att ributed to the vaccine. The levels of H. influenzae bacteria found in the respiratory tracts of participants was no t signicantly different between the vaccine and placebo groups. Due to inconsistencies of measurement betw een the trials, we were not able to compare the studies against one another. Antibiotics, which can be an indicator of severe infection, were s ignicantly more commonly prescribed in the placebo group. Evid ence of hospital admissions showed that there was no difference in the likelihood of being hospitalised in either the vaccine or p lacebo group. T wo trials studying quality of life found that vaccinat ed participants generally had a better quality of life, but th ese results were measured differently and so could not be compared. Adverse effects were not reported nor clearly dened amongst t he trials. Five trials reported adverse effects but there was no particular association with either the vaccine or placebo group. Further re search is needed to dene adverse effects as outcome measures fo rm o r e denitive analyses regarding vaccine side effects. Quality of the evidence The studies were well conducted with moderate risk of bias. The main limitation of this review was the lack of consistency regar ding the denitions and outcome measures among the individual studie s, which affected the overall synthesis and interpretation of the results. Fewer participants may cause the results to be more likely to be affected by chance. One trial had more participants than the othe r v e combined and it contributed more to the nal analysis. There wa s moderate heterogeneity (the studies show quite different r esults) when this study was included in the analysis, especially in num bers of infections. However, the results are consistent and do not change if this study is removed from the analysis. Conclusion We concluded after reviewing the relevant studies that the H. influenzae vaccine taken orally in people with chronic bronchitis and COPD does not have a signicant reduction in the number and seve rity of acute exacerbations. 3 Haemophilus preventing acute exacerbations of chr onic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.BACKGROUND Description of the condition Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by persistent airflow limitation that is progressive and ass ociated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response. The chronic airflow limitation characteristic of COPD is caused by a mixture of small airways disease (obstructive bronchiolitis) and gas-exch ange impediment through parenchymal destruction (emphysema). The changes associated with an inflammatory response include cellul ar inltrate, mucus secretion and structural remodelling, which d i- minishes the overall ability of the airways to remain patent during expiration. This limitation in airflow, as a measurement of d isease severity, is best measured and assessed by spirometry (COPD i s dened as the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) being lower than 80% of the predicted normal) ( GOLD 2011 ; Otczyk 2011 ). Chronic bronchitis is dened clinically by the presence of cough and sputum production for at least three months in each of two consecutive years. It is an independent disease entity which ma y precede or follow the development of airflow limitation and ma y be associated with development and/or acceleration of xed air - flow limitation, that is, COPD. Chronic bronchitis may exist i n patients with normal spirometry ( GOLD 2011 ). While patients can remain undiagnosed and have no clinical evidence of a lung disease until they present with advanced COPD, many have a history of symptomatic disease, evidenced as chronic cough and sputum (chronic bronchitis) and/or recurrent episodes of acute wheezy bronchitis and/or late onset reversible airways dise ase (in- trinsic asthma). Currently, the diagnosis of an acute exacerba tion is based entirely on clinical presentation. There is no consens us regarding an objective measurement of an exacerbation ( GOLD 2011 ). The relationship between these entities is complex and not well understood, with no obligatory linkage with COPD but ha s the capacity to progress to COPD ( Otczyk 2011 ). An acute exacerbation is dened as an acute event characterised by worsening of the patient's respiratory symptoms beyond nor mal daily variations and can lead to a change in medication ( GOLD 2011 ). The best predictors of exacerbations are a history of pre- viously treated exacerbations and worsening airflow limitat ion (GOLD 2011 ). They may be triggered by bacterial or viral in- fection (or both simultaneously), environmental pollutants o ra s yet undetermined factors. The characteristic response is incre ased inflammation resulting in increased purulent sputum producti on, hyperinflation and gas trapping, with reduced expiratory flow , thus accounting for the dyspnoea associated with these episode s (GOLD 2011 ). Whilst participants with an atopic constitution (hypersensitive to allergens) may have a predisposition to d evelop COPD, it should be recognised that bacterial colonisation of da m- aged airways plays an important pathogenic role. In particip antswith established obstructive lung disease, acute attacks of in fection are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The GOLD guidelines estimate the prevalence of COPD to range from 7.8% to 19.7% of the population worldwide ( GOLD 2011 ). COPD is very prominent in populations of smokers and ex-smok- ers. However, estimates of prevalence in people who have neve r smoked range from 3% to 11% ( GOLD 2011 ). The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates 5% of all deaths globally can be attributed to COPD, with the disease becoming the third leadi ng cause of death by 2030 ( WHO 2013 ). Whilst epidemiological in- formation regarding COPD comes from high-income countries, 90% of COPD deaths occur in low and middle-income countries (WHO 2013 ). The management of acute exacerbations focuses on treating trig - gers (including infections) and relieving symptoms with bron- chodilators, glucocorticoids and antibiotics. Prevention of fu rther exacerbations focuses on vaccination of influenza and pneumo- coccus strains ( WHO 2013 ). A recent Cochrane review on the use of prophylactic antibiotics for COPD exacerbations conclude d there was a reduction in the number of patients experiencing ex - acerbations with continuous macrolide antibiotic use. The num - ber needed to treat to prevent one exacerbation was eight. The se promising ndings need to be weighed against the risks from l ong- term antibiotic use such as side effects of medications and bacte rial resistance ( Herath 2013 ). Bacterial and viral causative agents have been identied and m ay coexist in a benign or pathogenic capacity; because of this, the s pe- cic microbiological aetiology of acute exacerbations in chronic bronchitis and COPD patients remains a matter of debate. The pathogens responsible for these acute exacerbations are ofte nf o u n d in the participant's upper respiratory tract and (opportunist ic) in- fections are caused by an upset in the balance of the host-par- asite relationship. Bacterial colonisation is most common and more severe compared to viral infections. The upper respirato ry tract is commonly home to Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epider- midis ),Staphylococcus aureus ). The lower respiratory tract is normally virtually free of micro-organisms, due to phy sio- logical clearance mechanisms (e.g. mucociliary clearance). How- ever, should these systems become damaged (as is the case in COPD or bronchitis patients), pathogens such as non-typeable H. influenzae (NTHi) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. a e r u g i n o s a )a r e usually the ones to colonise these sites ( Butt 1990 ). NTHi is of particular importance in this scenario because of its frequent a nd predominant pattern of mucosal colonisation of the respirato ry tract. Higher levels of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) have been detect ed in the serum of patients with COPD and it has been observed that NTHi triggers histamine release. This process occurs thro ugh both IgE- and non-IgE-dependent mechanisms from cells con- tained within the respiratory mucosal sensitised to the bacte rium. These ndings demonstrate that NTHi may also play a role in th e 8 Haemophilus influenzae oral vaccination for preventing acute exacerbations of chr onic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.development of the reversible component of airways obstructi on in COPD. Immediate hypersensitivity via IgE anti-bacterial a nti- bodies to colonising bacteria may contribute to bronchial disea se progression and severity ( Otczyk 2011 ). As these conditions have been associated with high numbers of NTHi, the vaccine was con- sidered to be relevant in prevention of exacerbation frequen cy and severity. Description of the intervention Various treatment strategies have been attempted including im- muno-stimulatory agents made from bacterial extracts, such as OM-85 BV, and antibiotics. While OM-85 BV appears not to af- fect the occurrence of acute exacerbations of bronchitis, it reduces the severity of the exacerbation (55% less total days of hospit ali- ( Collet 1997 ). Conventional antibi- otic therapy has not been particularly helpful, possibly due to the inability to effectively clear respiratory flora such as NTHi th at leads to further growth and sepsis ( Foxwell 1998 ;Murphy 1992 ; Van Alphen 1995 ). Recent studies have identied a role for antibi- otics in the treatment of COPD ( Albert 2011 ;Macfarlane 2001 ). Although signicant differences in the incidence of exacerbatio n were noted between groups, the long-term effect on microbial re - sistance was not reported. This underscores the importance of e x- ploring vaccination as a prophylactic treatment of COPD. An alternative strategy is mucosal immunisation. Successful v ac- cines for H. influenzae depend on immunity stimulation against the type-specic polysaccharide capsule of Haemophilus influenzae B(Hib). Following the development of successful vaccines for in- fections caused by Hib, attention is now focused on developing a vaccine for NTHi. Accordingly, an oral, whole-cell NTHi vaccine has been developed to prevent NTHi infections, which is the focu s of this review. Oral immunisation reduced bacterial loads in participants who were chronically colonised and NTHi-specic cellular responses were detected in white blood cells (lymphocytes) in the serum (Otczyk 2010 ). This suggests that a NTHi vaccine may be useful as it demonstrates that mucosal immunisation can be used thera - peutically to enhance or modify an immune response to improve the outcomes of an established chronic mucosal infection ( Otczyk 2010 ). How the intervention might work The vaccine is believed to be most effectively absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract in order to trigger an immune resp onse. The killed NTHi cells of the vaccine are coated with formalin to protect it from gastric degradation, thus enabling it to acce ss the M-cells of the gut mucosal immune system through pattern- recognition receptors that are designed to identify pathogen -as- sociated molecular patterns (i.e. PRR-PAMP interactions). Hu-man and animal studies support the hypothesis that oral NTHi immunisation stimulates T-cells in the Peyers patches trointestinal tract ( Foxwell 1998 ). The T-cells, upon stimulation from the vaccine, migrate to the respiratory system via affere nt lymphatics and blood, where they are further stimulated by ba c- teria in the bronchial mucosa. Cytokines are secreted from the stimulated T-cells to further increase immune activity. This re sults in increased recruitment and up-regulation of neutrophil whit e blood cells into the bronchial space, which in turn assists in clea r- ing bacteria through phagocytosis and thus reducing the bacteri al load ( Clancy 2011 ). However, it is to be noted that this form of immunisation does not trigger classical mucosal Immunoglobulin A (IgA) responses but rather by the means outlined above. Nonetheless, an oral vacci ne of inactivated NTHi makes use of a 'physiological protective lo op' to improve airway immune function. The vaccine is consumed orally and digested within the gastrointestinal tract, which triggers an innate immune response in the respiratory tract. Through a specic activation of immune cells (in the gastrointestinal tra ct) this initiates non-specic protection (in the airways). Pathway s that stimulate T-helper 17 immune cells responsible for airwa y protection then generate an increased white blood cell respons ive- ness to all pathogens in the respiratory tract ( Clancy 2011 ). Why it is important to do this review COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Acute exac- erbations of COPD reflect intense intrabronchial inflammation , where recurrent exacerbations are linked to worsening of airfl ow obstruction and health status of the individual. Acute exacerb a- tions of COPD can be fatal. Recent studies demonstrate that ora l immunotherapy with NTHi reduces the level of bacterial coloni- sation in the airways as well as the incidence and severity of acu te exacerbations ( Otczyk 2011 ). Chronic antibiotic therapy is not particularly feasible, so an oral, whole-cell vaccination for NTHi has been developed to reduce morbidity and mortality in participants at risk. Clinical ben et has been reflected in reduced incidence and severity of exacerbations in a number of studies. A review of trials that use oral NTHi whol e- cell vaccinations should evaluate if oral immunotherapy provi des a signicant therapeutic advance in limiting damage in COPD and may highlight the pathogenic role of bacterial colonisati on of damaged airways. This is an update of a Cochrane Review rst published in 1998 and last updated in 2006 ( Foxwell 2006 ). The previous authors concluded that participants with recurrent bronchitis vaccinated in the autumn have a decreased incidence and severity of their exacerbations during winter.

Any associated adverse side effects from the NTHi vaccination, measurable from symptomology and participant reports. 4. Quality of life. A validated tool measurement was require d for trials to be included in this review.Search methods for identication of studies Electronic searches We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled T rial s (CENTRAL) (2014, Issue 6), which includes the Acute Respi- ratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (194 6 to July week 3, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to July 2014), CINAHL (1981 to July 2014), LILACS (1985 to July 2014) and Web of Science (1955 to July 2014). We used the search strategy in Appendix 1 to search MED- LINE and CENTRAL. We combined the MEDLINE search with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifyin g randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity-maximising Ovid format ( Lefebvre 2011 ). We adapted the search strategy to (see 2 Web of Science (seeAppendix 5 ). We used no publication or language restrictions. Searching other resources We searched the clinical trials registers, WHO International Cl in- ical T pleted and ongoing trials (last searched 29 July 2014). We also searched reference lists of included trials and review studies ;b o o k s related to respiratory tract infections, mucosal immunology o r vac- cines; abstracts from respiratory conferences, immunology conf er- ences, microbiology conferences or vaccine conferences; and sent written enquiries to the authors of major relevant studies a nd ex- perts in the eld. We also contacted pharmaceutical companies to obtain access to unpublished trials. Data collection and analysis Selection of studies T wo review authors (KL, ET) assessed titles and abstracts retr ieved from the search to determine their relevance concerning the ob- jectives of this review. We managed disagreements through di s- cussion and/or a deciding arbiter (MVD). We entered all search results into Review Manager 5.2 ( RevMan 2012 ). Data extraction and management T wo review authors (HH, SNP) designed a data extraction sheet for trial reports, which was pilot tested using sample studie sa n d revised by the other authors. T wo review authors (HH, SNP) the n independently extracted data from the reports. We extracted d ata from each report separately and then combined data in the event of multiple reports for the same study. We managed disagreem ents through discussion and/or a deciding arbiter (MVD). 10 Haemophilus influenzae oral vaccination for preventing acute exacerbations of chr onic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Assessment of risk of bias in included studies T wo review authors (KL, JP) independently analysed each trial in conjunction with The Cochrane Collaboration's table for asses s- ing 'Risk of bias' ( Higgins 2011 ;RevMan 2014 ): sequence genera- tion, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome dat a, selective outcome reporting and other potential threats to va lidity are domains that we judged each study on. Review authors' judg e- ments involved rating the risk of bias for each domain as \"high \"o r \"low\" or \"unclear\" whilst providing supporting information that led to that rating. We managed disagreements through discuss ion and/or a deciding arbiter (MVD). Measures of treatment effect 1. We presented dichotomous (binary) data as a measure of risk and relative risk by using an odds ratio (OR) or risk ratio (RR) with 95% condence intervals (CIs). We calculated the absolute risk reduction (ARR) for consumer comparison against other treatments or non-treatment. 2. We presented continuous data as mean differences (MDs) if the same scale was used or as standardised mean differences (SMDs) if different scales were used with a standard deviation (SD) of the estimate. 3. We looked for quality of life (QoL) outcomes as measured in the included studies. Quality of life measurements had to b e measured using a validated tool. If possible, we pooled thes e outcomes but if not, we discussed and summarised them. 4. We have pooled data reported as rates by using the inverse variance method as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011 ). Unit of analysis issues The unit of analysis in our review is the participant. Dealing with missing data We contacted the trial authors of the original studies when fur ther data or information was required. We performed analyses bas ed on intention-to-treat (ITT), such that we assumed missing data for randomised participants to be treatment failures in this review. This ITT analysis may underestimate the effect of the interve ntion, therefore we performed both ITT and on-treatment analyses to explore the impact of missing data on the overall outcome. We presented the ndings of these analyses in the Discussion section. Assessment of heterogeneity We assessed included trials for heterogeneity (which is a varia - tion in study outcomes amongst the studies as further dened i n Higgins 2011 ) through two successive steps to determine if they should be pooled with the rest of the included trials or report ed in a systematic review.1. T wo review authors (KL, JP) independently analysed trials for their 'face-value' similarities: that is, for clinical dive rsity (participants, interventions and outcomes) and methodologica l diversity (study design and risk of bias). 2. We subsequently assessed trials for statistical heteroge neity using the Chi2test with a P value of less than 0.10 being statistically signicant. We calculated the I2statistic as instructed in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011 ;RevMan 2014 ). If this was greater than 50% we considered the pooled trials to be signicantly heterogeneou s. Assessment of reporting biases If a sufcient number of studies had been pooled (i.e. greater t han 25), we planned to use a funnel plot to visually inspect the risk of publication bias, where more pronounced asymmetry of the funnel plot may be indicative of a substantial overestimatio no f the intervention effect ( Higgins 2011 ;RevMan 2014 ). Data synthesis We synthesised the data as follows. 1. We used a xed-effect model for binary or continuous data in the absence of statistical heterogeneity (I2< 50%) according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011 ;RevMan 2014 ). 2. We used a random-effects model for binary or continuous data in the presence of statistical heterogeneity (I2>5 0 % )f o r pooling the trial data using the Mantel-Haenszel method according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011 ;RevMan 2014 ). This model of analysis will make the assumption that the studies are not measuring for the same intervention effect, but instead will consequently estimate for an overall intervention effect tha ti s trending amongst the studies. 3. We also used the xed-effect model to pool study data that reported events as rates according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions ; only xed-effect meta-analysis methods are available in RevMan for 'O - E and Variance' outcome ( Higgins 2011 ;RevMan 2014 ). Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity If sufcient data were available, we planned to explore speci c subgroups for further analyses of treatment effect. 1. Comparison of continued-smoking versus ex-smoking populations. 2. Younger (< 65 years) versus older (65 years and older) participants. Sensitivity analysis If sufcient data were available, we planned to perform sensi tivity analyses by: 11 Haemophilus influenzae acute exacerbations of chr onic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.1. examining how the addition of high risk of bias studies to low risk of bias studies impacts on the overall outcome to determine the effects of risk of bias; and 2. examining which studies contribute to heterogeneity and how this impacts on the overall outcome. We used different methods of pooling, e.g. initially poolin ga l l trials and then excluding one-by-one specic trials from the met a- analysis and comparing the results, whilst also comparing the use of a xed-effect versus random-effects model for the pooling analy sis. Otherwise, we entered trials one-by-one into the meta-analysi st o assess the robustness of the pooled estimates.RESULTS Description of studies Results of the search We obtained 105 records from our searches as described in Search methods for identication of studies . From the search result, we identied 10 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which provid ed data pertinent to the non-typeable H. influenzae oral vaccine in preventing acute exacerbations in chronic bronchitis and COPD (Figure 1 ). 12 Haemophilus influenzae for preventing acute exacerbations of chr onic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Included studies We included six studies in this review ( Clancy 1985 ;Clancy 1990 ; Clancy 2013 ;Lehmann 1991 ;Tandon 1991 ;Tandon 2010 ). The main features of the included trials are summarised in the Characteristics of included studies table. The methods are de- scribed here in greater detail, largely using direct excerpts o ft h e original papers as these demonstrate the trials' strengths and weak- nesses in the words of the original authors. Overview All six of the included studies were clinical placebo-controlled RCTs, ve of which were double-blinded 2013 ;Lehmann 1991 ;Tandon 1991 )a n do n e was single-blinded ( Clancy 1990 ). They were conducted to test the efcacy of enteric-coated, killed preparations of H. influenzae in populations prone to recurrent acute exacerbations of chroni c bronchitis or COPD. The vaccine preparation and immunisation regime used in all trials consisted of at least three courses of forma- lin-killed H. influenzae in enteric-coated tablets taken at intervals (for example, on days 0, 28 and 56). Each course generally con- sisted of two tablets taken after breakfast over three consecu tive days. In all cases, the placebo groups took enteric-coated tablet s containing glucose. The trials varied in duration from three to 12 months. Random i- sation in the trials was achieved by having a pharmacist indepe n- dently preparing treatment packages that contained either act ive or placebo tablets ( Clancy 1990 ;Lehmann 1991 ;Tandon 1991 ). These packages were numbered and randomised before being dis - tributed to the clinicians involved in the trials, where the ph ar- macist was responsible for disclosing the randomised codes at t he conclusion of the trial. The trials varied in population groups, with most trials incl ud- ing chronic bronchitis or COPD patients in Australia with mean ages between 40 and 80 years ( Clancy 1985 ;Clancy 1990 ;Clancy 2013 ;Tandon 1991 1991 was con- ducted in chronic bronchitis or COPD patients in Papua New Guinea, with a mean age of 51 years. Bacterial load was assessed by a standardised method across th es i x trials. Multiple cultures were performed on each person. In no rmal circumstances, the rst culture following vaccination was taken a t three months. Cultures were taken at regular three-monthly i n- tervals and extra cultures taken during illness. The method o fo b - taining samples, transporting material and culture methods gen- erally followed a set protocol for adequate specimen handling and control. However, the lack of consistency and wide variety of mea - surement styles used amongst the studies to calculate and repo rt carriage levels made analyses between studies difcult.Measured outcomes in the trials were varied but included bacter ial load within the respiratory tract, the number and severity of acute exacerbations and the usage of antibiotics. These outcomes wer e not always statistically useful. Corticosteroids were administered at a similar rate in both a ctive and placebo groups. Antibiotics were prescribed in both arms of the trial according to standard respiratory medicine clinical cri te- ria at the time of the respective trials. Such criteria included i n- crease in volume and purulence of sputum, usually with increase d breathlessness and sometimes fever. Clancy 1985 was carried out and published by Clancy in 1985 and 1987 and is the oldest trial relevant to this review. It is a do uble- blind, placebo-controlled RCT conducted in New South Wales (Australia) over a period of three months in the winter of 1983 . The mean age in the treatment group was 65.5 years and in the placebo group it was 64.7 years. Its focus was the immunogenic- ity of the H. influenzae oral vaccine and the clinical impact on patients with airways damaged by COPD who suffer recurrent episodes of acute bronchitis. Fifty patients with COPD (not tak - ing corticosteroids or immunosuppressants) were recruited fr om the chest clinic of the Royal Newcastle Hospital and were given a three-day course of tablets (two daily) at 0, 28 and 56 days. Placebo and non-typeable Haemophilus two placebo arms in their trial; the rst group was given enteric-coated glu - cose tablets and the second was given sodium tauroglycocholate. We have used the results from the rst placebo group as this is a standard, widely used placebo, rather than the sodium taurog ly- cocholate group as this placebo may have contributed some thera- peutic effect. Participants were assessed by a chest physician, lung function (spirometry), throat cultures and saliva samples colle cted at baseline, 28, 56 and 84 days. The characteristics of participa nts entered into the trial demonstrated a very representative p opula- tion; older adults (mean age 65 years), majority male (M:F 4.5: 1), majority smokers (86%). H. influenzae was isolated from 69% of sputum samples collected during acute bronchitis episodes in this population. Clancy 1985 concluded that the NTHi vaccine resulted in over 90% protection against acute exacerbations com - pared to the placebo group. This was not still the case at follow -up a year later, at which point there was also no signicant reducti on in incidence of H. influenzae carriage. That is, no clear correlation between clinical protection from acute exacerbations and either carriage of H. influenzae or the level of antibody to H. influenzae antigen in saliva was evident. It was also noted that the prot ection provided by the vaccine did not extend to the subsequent winter , which is consistent with the knowledge that mucosal immunity is less durable than systemic immunity. Clancy 1990 was a double-blind RCT trial conducted in Australia over a six-month period. There were a total of 37 participants w ith 14 Haemophilus influenzae oral vaccination for preventing acute exacerbations of chr onic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.each group having similar baseline characteristics. This study had a population with a mean age of 65.5 +/- 2.9 and they were re- cruited from a chest clinic in Newcastle. Episodes were dened by an increase in purulence and volume of sputum with associated fever, cough, shortness of breath and antibiotic therapy. Ea ch par- ticipant was assessed by a chest physician, completed a respirat ory questionnaire (ATS OLD 78), and had sputum and mixed saliva samples taken and lung function via spirometry. Each group re- ceived three courses of oral tablets for the three consecutive da ys at 0, 28, 56 days. One group received the active preparation con- taining H. influenzae vaccine while the other group received a glu- cose-containing placebo preparation. There was a signicant re- duction in the number of episodes of acute wheezy bronchitis in the treated group with a P value of 0.02. There was a signicant re- duction (41%) in the total number of acute infections in the treat - ment group compared to placebo group but no signicant change when acute infections were considered in an individual from eit her group. This study had other modes of measuring severity, such as the number of participants reporting infections and the numbe r of infections prescribed antibiotics, and all the results supp orted the treatment group. There was no signicant difference noted in the side effect prole in either group. Clancy 2013 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective study conducted for nine months over the Australian winter of 2011. Participants included 320 moderate-severe COPD partic- ipants with FEV 1< 60%, requiring oral systemic corticosteroid therapy or admission into hospital and they were recruited fr om 21 sites across Australia; the mean age of participants in the t reat- ment arm was 71.2 years and in the placebo arm was 67.9 years. Patients in the intervention group were given two HI-164 oral vac- cine enteric-coated tablets per day that each contained 45 mg of the formalin-inactivated NTHi (HI-164) active vaccine, with the placebo group receiving a glucose substitute. Its outcomes asse ssed the number of exacerbations (according to the St George's Respi- ratory Questionnaire), carriage levels (from cultured sputum s am- ples), hospitalisations and antibiotic/steroid prescriptio ns (based on medical records). The aim of this study was to extend the database from earlier and smaller studies showing that maxi mum protection occurred in those with most severe disease, with the most sensitive indicator being a reduction in exacerbations re quir- ing corticosteroid therapy and/or hospital admission. This cu rrent study provides evidence that the age-related vaccine benets in COPD noted with parenteral vaccines apply also to oral vaccines that enhance mucosal immunity within the bronchus. The results were only minutely signicant in circumstances of low exposure to NTHi and only amongst a subgroup of younger participants (aged under 65), given more responsive immune systems and less established airway disease. The results were otherwise not signi- cant for those older than 65 years of age. Lehmann 1991 was a prospective, double-blind RCT , conducted through the Pneumonia Research Programme in Papua New Guinea. As a result, the demographic characteristics are signi -cantly different to those found in high-income communities. Po- tential participants were identied by nomination from town res- idents and villagers and were then followed up by a standard q ues- tionnaire, which identied people suffering from chronic lun gd i s - ease. Participants who matched the eligibility criteria were e xam- ined with lung function tests and spirometry at time of entry i nto the trial. Randomisation and blinding of medication and place bo was done by the pharmacy department at the Royal Newcastle Hospital, New South Wales; the placebo and active vaccine looked identical and the randomisation code was held by Auspharm In- ternational Ltd until the completion of the trial. Both group sw e r e similar at baseline following allocation. Administration o fm e d - ication was overseen by doctors and nurses to maintain compli- ance in the 12-month follow-up period. Patients lost to follow- up included eight in the vaccine group and three in the placebo group, with three deaths in the vaccine group and one death in th e placebo group. The trial does not mention any intention-to-tre at (ITT) analysis for these patients, rather stating \"permanen te x i t from the study were excluded from the calculation\", potentiall y creating attrition bias. The trial concludes that for the popul a- tion of the highlands of Papua New Guinea the vaccine protected against episodes of acute bronchitis, but not against more sev ere forms of acute lower respiratory tract infection. A limitation of the study was the need for a larger population group to ensure gre ater statistical power to help determine the extent of protection o ral H. influenzae vaccine could provide. Tandon 1991 was a double-blinded RCT , conducted in 1988 at the repatriation hospital in Western Australia. This study recruited 64 participants with chronic bronchitis and a history of recurre nt respiratory tract infections in order to nd out whether oral N THi immunisation is effective in this participant group. Particip ants were divided randomly into placebo (mean age 71.1 years) and va c- cine (mean age 73.1 years) groups. All the participants followe dt h e same treatment regime consisting of three courses of the table ts on days 0, 28 and 56. Study outcomes were acute infective episodes, number of antibiotic prescriptions and colonisation with H. in- fluenzae , monitored through the following strategies: primary care physician for diagnosing acute infective episodes, sputum sam ple, visual analogue scale (VAS). For all of these variables, bette r out- comes were demonstrated in the vaccine group. Previous studies have demonstrated that H. influenzae was the main constituent in bacterial colonisation of the bronchus and therefore vaccinat - ing against it would reduce the incidence of acute exacerbations, which is consistent with the results of this study. Tandon 2010 was a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at four sites around Australia. The study test ed the efcacy of HI-164OV in reducing the number and severity of acute exacerbations in participants with severe COPD. Acute exa c- erbations were dened by an increase in volume and purulence of sputum. Each participant took the same regime (two tablets dail y for three consecutive days) with courses repeated at day 28 and 56. All tablets were identical-looking, enteric-coated capsules that 15 Haemophilus influenzae oral vaccination for preventing acute exacerbations of chr onic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.contained either vaccine (N = 18) or placebo (N = 20). Participants were followed up every four weeks via a respiratory question naire, sputum and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected to monitor bac- terial colonisation and blood samples were collected to monito r antibodies. The primary variables were the number and durat ion of exacerbations and the number of antibiotic courses prescrib ed. Baseline demographic characteristics, such as mean age (vaccine 69.5, placebo 67.5) were very similar, demonstrating effecti ve ran- domisation. However the exact method of randomisation was no t disclosed. Four of the six authors of this study disclosed that they had received funding from Hunter Immunology Limited. The au- thors concluded that the vaccine was safe and had a signicant efcacy in participants with severe COPD. Benets were noted with respect to a reduction in the severity of episodes (duratio no f episodes; 14.3 vaccine group and 22.7 placebo, P value < 0.01), which required less antibiotic therapy (event rate; 0.83 vaccin e and 1.15 placebo, P value < 0.05) and fewer admissions to hos- pital (three in the vaccine group compared to 12 in the placebo group, P value < 0.05). However, a reduction in the incidence of episodes did not reach signicance possibly because the study wa s signicantly underpowered. Excluded studies We excluded one study because it did not meet our inclusion crite- ria (Clancy 2010 ). As noted in Characteristics of excluded studies , the participant population included smokers who did not have formally diagnosed COPD or chronic bronchitis and outcome measures were limited to physiological markers that did not i n- clude the clinical outcomes dened in this review's protocol. Three studies are cited only in trial registries and pending formal publication of the raw trial data by the investigators (ACTRN12606000074594 2013 ;ACTRN12606000076572 2013 ;ACTRN12610000916044 2013 ). The main features of these unpublished trials can be found in Characteristics of studies awaiting classication . These trials have potential to be incorpo- rated into future updates of this review. Risk of bias in included studies As u m m a r yo ft h e' R i s ko fb i a s 'a s s e s s m e n ti sd e t a i l e di nt h e Characteristics of included studies table. Allocation The random sequence generation in the studies was generally d e- termined to be poor, with 50% of the studies graded as either high or unclear risk ( Clancy 1985 ;Clancy 2013 ;Tandon 2010 ), because they did not provide any information regarding the ra n- dom sequence generation and subsequent allocation process. We considered the remaining studies to have a low risk of bias giv en that there were reports that a third party conducted randomisa tionand the allocation codes were kept condential until the end of the trial ( Clancy 1990 ;Lehmann 1991 ;Tandon 1991 ). The allocation concealment in the selected studies was generall y poor, with 67% of the studies categorised as either unclear or h igh risk of bias ( Clancy 1985 ;Clancy 1990 ;Clancy 2013 ;Tandon 2010 ). Only two studies demonstrated a low risk of bias, where the handling and distribution of the treatment packages was carri ed out independently by the pharmacist who employed an appro- priate randomisation chart and safely kept the package trial co de associated with the patient ( Lehmann 1991 ;Tandon 1991 ). Blinding Suitable blinding was performed in all studies, except for on e, which we deemed to be at high risk as it did not blind the com- mercially available polybacterial tablets ( Clancy 1990 ). For this reason, the study was subsequently conducted as a single-blind ed trial (participants blinded). All of the studies reported usin gi d e n - tical enteric-coated tablets for both intervention and placebo a rms of the trial. Incomplete outcome data Five of the six included studies accounted for and provided suf - cient information regarding the follow-up of patients that dr opped out of the trials ( Clancy 1985 ;Clancy 1990 ;Clancy 2013 ;Tandon 1991 ;Tandon 2010 ).Lehmann 1991 made no mention of in- tention-to-treat analysis and reported a substantial loss to follow- up (eight participants from the vaccine group and three from the placebo group), especially considering the small group size. Selective reporting We found no selective reporting in any of the studies. Other potential sources of bias We identied no other potential sources of bias. Effects of interventions See:Summary of ndings for the main comparison Primary outcomes 1. Incidence of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis o r chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Six trials evaluating 557 patients assessed the effectivene ss of non- typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) oral vaccination on the frequency of acute exacerbations in patients with advanced lung 16 Haemophilus influenzae oral vaccination for preventing acute exacerbations of chr onic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.disease ( Figure 2 ;Table 1 ). The meta-analysis concluded that there was a small, non-signicant 2.048% decrease in exacerbations in the vaccinated group when compared to the placebo group (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% condence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.12, P value = 0.68) ( Analysis 1.1 ). Figure 2. Forest plot of comparison: 1 Primary outcomes, out come: 1.1 Exacerbations (number of exacerbations/person/year).Refer to for Overall rate est imates of acute exacerbations across included studies. Despite all trials having almost identical primary objective s, there was a considerable discrepancy in the manner in which the pri- mary outcomes were reported. For example, Clancy 1985 reported overall number of infections, whereas Tandon 2010 reported the number of infections per participant. In order to allow meanin gful comparisons between studies we converted all data into a rate o f exacerbations (number of exacerbations per participant per yea r). Of the six studies incorporated into the review only one demon - strated an effect that favoured the vaccination group ( Clancy 1985 ).Clancy 1985 is a small trial, which enrolled 33 partici- pants. The data showed a very signicant positive effect in fav our of the vaccine group, only recording one event compared to the 13 in the placebo group, which was statistically signicant (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.55) despite the very large CI. However, subgroup analysis demonstrated that removing this study fr om the pool had no bearing on the overall meta-analysis outcome as its small population meant this study's weighting was very smal l. Five studies, with a total of 504 participants, did not show a s ig- nicant increase in the number of Tandon 2010 ). As a result, their combined contribution to this meta-analysis wei ght- ing was 99.5%. Clancy 2013 is the largest trial, comprising 320 patients and re-ceiving over 70% of the meta-analysis weighting. It shows a non - signicant 8% increase in the number of exacerbations in the placebo group (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.29). Clancy 2013 re- ports 249 events in the vaccine group compared with 270 in the placebo group. There is a moderate degree of heterogeneity in this meta-anal ysis (I2statistic = 57%, P value = 0.04). The study that contributes most to this effect is the Clancy 1985 trial. Removal of Clancy 1985 dramatically reduces the heterogeneity (I2statistic = 24% and the P value = 0.26). 2. Mortality Mortality was not formally assessed as an outcome in any of the tri- als. However, ve trials reported deaths of trial participan (Clancy ) (Figure 3 ). Of these deaths, none were attributed to the vaccine and most were considered the natural endpoint of their respir atory disease or other unrelated chronic disease. There was a great er in- cidence of mortality in the placebo group. However, this result was not statistically signicant (odds ratio (OR) 1.62, P value = 0.3 1), with a low amount of heterogeneity between results (I2statistic = 9%, P value = 0.36) ( Analysis 1.2 ). 17 Haemophilus influenzae preventing acute exacerbations of chr onic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Figure 3. Forest plot of comparison: 1 Primary outcomes, out come: 1.2 Mortality (deaths during trial period). Secondary outcomes 1. Carriage level of NTHi in the respiratory tract Analysis of carriage levels of H. influenzae in patients with chronic bronchitis was attempted in all six RCTs. No meta-analysis coul d be performed as there were a myriad of different techniques us ed to measure carriage levels objectively (throat swabs, sputum sam ples and culture) and carriage rates were measured at different int ervals. Of all the trials, three failed to nd a signicant difference b etween carriage levels ( Clancy 1985 ;Clancy 1990 ;Tandon 1991 ). T wo studies showed a signicant decrease in carriage rates in the va ccine group ( Lehmann 1991 ;Tandon 2010 ). In one study carriage levels were measured but sputum samples could only be obtained at 36% of planned visits, of which 11% grew a respiratory pathoge n; these numbers were too small to determine any effe ct following vaccination ( Clancy 2013 ). Lehmann 1991 showed that during acute exacerbations the mean concentrations of H. influenzae carriage levels were higher in the vaccine group (8.91 x 106colony-forming units (cfu)) when com- pared against the placebo (1.55 x 106cfu). However, this only equated to a 5% difference between the vaccinated and placebo arms when counting individual specimens, whereby 91% of the vaccinated and 86% of the placebo collected specimens success- fully grew H. influenzae colonisations during the trial period. Tandon 2010 demonstrated that there was a signicant (P value <0.05) two-fold difference between the placebo and active arms in overall positive cultures (65 positive cultures in the placebo g roup compared to 33 in the vaccine group). However, the percentage of validated sputum samples was 50% and 48% for placebo and active groups, respectively. H. influenzae only accounted for 51% and 33% of positive cultures in the placebo group and the vaccinated group, respectively. There was a trend for studies to report a transient decline in H. influenzae carriage levels. However, this had always returned to baseline by the end of the study time frame. Tandon 1991 noted a transient drop in carriage levels to 12% at 14 weeks in the acti ve group, which then reverted back to 25% at 24 weeks. This is a 4% drop over 24 weeks. The placebo group noted a small 2% drop over the 24-week study period. Furthermore, in Clancy 1985 H. influenzae was isolated from throat swabs from 70% of the placebo group compared with 53% of the vaccination group at the end of a four-week period. Carriage rates at 12 weeks declined to 50% i n the placebo group and 23% in the vaccine group. 2. Numbers of prescriptions for antibiotics and corticosteroids in the trial and follow-up periods (includ ing hospital admissions) as an indication of severity of acute exacerbations Four studies, evaluating 462 patients, assessed the effect o fN T H i oral vaccination on the number of antibiotic prescriptions in patients with chronic bronchitis ( Clancy 1990 ;Clancy 2013 ; Tandon 4 ;Table 2 ). 18 Haemophilus influenzae vaccination for preventing acute exacerbations of chr onic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Figure 4. Forest plot of comparison: 2 Secondary outcomes, o utcome: 2.1 Prescriptions (number of courses/person/year).Refer to for Overall rate estimates of antibiotic prescriptions across included studies. There were considerable discrepancies amongst studies in the w ay antibiotic prescriptions were objectively measured. We atte mpted to convert the reported data into a rate (number of courses/pers on/ year) so an objective comparison could be achieved. However, thi s was not possible with data from the Clancy 2013 trial, which only reported mean antibiotic use in days unlike the other studie s. As a result, only three studies could be pooled in meta-analysis. Tw o studies did not report any information on antibiotic usage i nt h i s population ( Clancy 1985 ;Lehmann 1991 ). The three studies in the meta-analysis included 143 patients (Clancy 1990 ;Tandon 1991 ;Tandon 2010 ). T wo of these studies produced data that favoured the vaccination group ( Tandon 1991 ; Tandon 2010 ), whereas the Clancy 1990 data did not reach sig- nicance. The overall effect was a statistically non-signicant 8 1% increase in use of antibiotic courses per person in the placebo g roup when compared against the vaccinated group (RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.44, P value = 0.61; with a RR > 1.0 indicating greater use of antibiotic usage in the placebo group) ( Analysis 2.1 ). The majority of the weighting could be attributed to Tandon 1991 and Tandon 2010 ; 64.9% and 31.1%, respectively, and both favoured the vaccination group. Tandon 1991 showed a signicant decrease in antibiotic prescrip- tions (45 in the active group and 79 in the placebo group). Tandon 2010 showed a signicant 56% reduction in the number of pre- scribed antibiotics following active treatment (P value < 0.05). TheClancy 1990 trial reports a reduction in the number of antibiotics in the active group compared to placebo, but this failed to reach statistical signicance. TheClancy 2013 trial is by far the largest study in this review (three times the combined size of the other three trials), contributin g3 2 0 of the 462 patients. Clancy reported that there was no signica nt difference between the two groups in terms of antibiotic usag e (active group 13.5 days per episode with a range of 0 to 289; placebo group 14 days per episode with a range of 1 to 122). Given the wide and varied protocols for antibiotic administration it was impossible to translate this into course/person/year as wit ht h e other trials. Corticosteroid prescriptions were not strictly studied as an o ut- come in the studies, and thus we did not meta-analyse these; nonetheless, usage was noted in participants in at least two s tudies (Clancy 2013 ;Tandon 2010 ), and we have considered their indi- cations and study ndings for their use in the Summary of main results . Hospitalisation data amongst the studies were limited, wit ho n l y two studies reporting hospitalisations of their participan ts The results demonstrate no signicantly increased likel i- hood of being hospitalised in either the vaccinated or placebo group (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.13 to 7.04, P value = 0.97) ( Analysis 2.2;Figure 5 ).

Any associated adverse side effects from the NTHi vaccination, measurable from symptomology and participant reports All studies, except Clancy 1985 , reported adverse events, although none of the trials studied this as an outcome. In total, betwee n the other studies, 142 adverse events were reported; of thes e, 72 occurred in the active group and 68 occurred in the placebo group (Analysis 2.3 ;Figure 6 ;Table 3 ). Reported adverse effects were largely gastrointestinal in nature, although others common ly re- ported increased dyspnoea or general malaise; none of these w ere directly evidenced to be attributable to the oral vaccine.

Clancy 2013 reported that adverse event rates were similar in both groups (placebo group 33.5% compared with 38.5% in the vac- cinated group), although the actual number of events was not provided in the original publication. Further data addition ally re- quested from the study authors show that one participant in th e active group had an adverse event compared with three in the placebo group. 4. Quality of life Only two studies reported quality of life measurements, how ever they used different assessment scales and are not comparable; we therefore did not meta-analyse them ( Clancy 2013 ;Tandon 1991 ). Tandon 1991 reported a global assessment for general well-being using a visual analogue scale (VAS). It reports at 24 weeks a med ian score of 5.0 in the vaccine group compared to 2.5 in the placebo group (P value = 0.09). Clancy 2013 measured quality of life using the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD (SGRQ-C) for those under 65 years old. They reported a signicant diffe rence in symptom scores in favour of the vaccine group at three months (P value = 0.02) and six months (P value = 0.01). Data were not provided for older age groups.DISCUSSION Summary of main results Incidence of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) In this review we evaluated the effectiveness of a non-typeabl e Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) oral vaccination in reducing acute exacerbations in patients with chronic bronchitis/chronic obs truc- tive pulmonary disease (COPD). The results indicate that the va c- cination has no signicant impact in reducing the number of ex- acerbations. Only one study was able to demonstrate a statist ically signicant effect, which favoured vaccination ( Clancy 1985 ). This was the smallest study and contributed signicant heterogene ity to the meta-analysis. When we removed Clancy 1985 from the meta-analysis, we found no signicant difference for the prima ry outcome. All other studies showed no signicant treatment eff ect. Among the studies included in the review, there are considerab le differences in the methodology and intervals at which measure - ments were recorded. The main outcome (acute exacerbations) was measured differently across the six studies, providing a chal- lenge for comparison. For example, Clancy 1985 records results as 20 Haemophilus influenzae oral vaccination for preventing acute exacerbations of chr onic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.a proportion whereas Lehmann 1991 utilises rates. There are also notable discrepancies in the study time periods, with Clancy 1985 reporting data at three months and Clancy 1990 providing data up to six months. Data recorded at nine to 12 months could only be elicited from two trials. As a result we converted all data in to rates so that studies could be objectively compared, irrespecti ve of their varying follow-up protocols. Other differences amongst the trials included variation in po pula- tion ( Lehmann 1991 was conducted in Papua New Guinea), the use of subjective measurements such as respiratory questionn aires to measure exacerbations and seasonal variations. These may have contributed to the marked heterogeneity (I2statistic = 57%; P value = 0.04) identied in the meta-analysis. Only one study was large enough to be able to conduct subgroup analysis stratied by age ( Clancy 2013 ). A subgroup analysis ex- cluding all patients greater than 65 years of age concluded that the mean number of exacerbations was signicantly higher in th e placebo group (56) when compared to the vaccinated group (34) (P value = 0.0015). There was also a statistically signicant dif fer- ence in the days to rst exacerbation (87 days in the placebo group compared to 111 days in the vaccine group). Although the data are limited at this stage, these results suggest the use of th eN T H i vaccination in a younger population, especially considering th at there was no difference in mortality or adverse events in thes et w o groups. The apparently greater efcacy of the vaccine seen in tho se less than 65 years old may be a reflection of a less severe burden of disease; younger patients generally have a shorter smoki ng his- tory, fewer exacerbations and fewer co-morbidities. Further s tud- ies need to be conducted in younger patients and considering the varying severity of COPD to identify whether there is a signi cant treatment effect in this population. Mortality We found mortality rates overall to be higher in the placebo gr oup. However, these results were not statistically signicant and are unconvincing. There was no apparent association with treatmen t effect and it is unclear whether the administration of the NTHi vaccine contributed to mortality. Other patient factors were suggested in some trials to contrib ute to mortality, such as long-standing cirrhosis or a ruptured aneur ysm reported in Tandon 1991 andLehmann 1991 . These co-morbidi- ties would have a signicant effect on the mortality outcome giv en the small participant numbers. T wo trials reported the primary cause of death as a terminal re spi- ratory infection ( Lehmann 1991 ;Tandon 1991 ), with other stud- ies reporting cause of death to be non-respiratory. Whilst it is un- derstood that the most common cause of death in COPD patients is respiratory failure, it was not clearly demonstrated in th is meta- analyses, which was likely due to inconsistent and insufcient re- porting in the studies.Carriage level of NTHi in the respiratory tract All six trials measured sputum carriage levels of H. influenzae ;t h e s e were obtained routinely and during acute exacerbations, alth ough the methods of reporting and intervals at which routine sampl es were taken differed. This limited the extent to which these re sults could be compared. A signicant difference in the carriage rates was not consistent ly found between the placebo and vaccine groups in every trial. No signicant difference over time in routine carriage rates was f ound between the groups in Clancy 1985 ,Lehmann 1991 andTandon 1991 . The largest of the studies obtained samples at only 36% of visits and of these, a respiratory pathogen was isolated i no n l y 11% ( Clancy 2013 ). The sputum carriage levels were too small to determine any signicant effect following vaccination. In the majority of trials, H. influenzae was noted to play a promi- nent role during infective exacerbations. In Clancy 1985 ,H. in- fluenzae was isolated from 69% of sputum samples collected dur- ing acute exacerbations; and from 33% and 44% in the placebo and vaccine groups respectively in Clancy 1990 (this difference was not signicant). Lehmann 1991 andTandon 2010 did not discuss the bacterial carriage specically during acute exacerba- tions. It is notable that Tandon 1991 found that the numbers of acute infective exacerbations were higher (P value = 0.011) in pa r- ticipants in the vaccine group from whose sputum H. influenzae was isolated either before or during an acute episode. Clancy 2013 noted that of the sputum samples that grew a respi- ratory pathogen, H. influenzae played a role, but not a prominent one, accounting for only 6%. 6.2% grew 1990 noted that during the six-month trial, the pro- portion of H. parainfluenzae infections was between 57% and 89% greater than the proportion of H. influenzae infections during the same time period across both groups. This poses the question o f the clinical impact of treating H. influenzae as prophylaxis, as the background carriage rates may reflect the rates in acute exacerba- tion. Also, many of the studies did not mention whether other pathogens were also found in the sputum samples that isolate d H. influenzae ; how many acute exacerbations are due to multiple organisms? The population studied in the Papua New Guinea study ( Lehmann 1991 ) raises concerns about the potential applicability of the re- sults to the COPD patient in a high-income country. Asymp- tomatic background carriage rates were high; 57% of routine sp u- tum samples isolated H. influenzae (37% isolated S. pneumoniae and 11% demonstrated H. parainfluenzae ). There were also some signicant methodological problems, with 53 out of 362 sample s having to be excluded due to betel nut consumption or epithelia l contamination. Numbers of prescriptions for antibiotics and corticosteroids in the trial 21 Haemophilus influenzae oral vaccination for preventing acute exacerbations of chr onic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Antibiotics were prescribed in four out of the six clinical trial s (Clancy 1990 ;Clancy 2013 ;Tandon 1991 ;Tandon 2010 ), but this was not necessarily an effective outcome measure that cor- related with disease progression or severity. Given the hig hv a r i - ability and lack of consistency concerning antibiotic course ad- ministration and measurements, a truly uniform assessment and comparison could not be performed amongst the trials. Whilst th e three studies pooled for quantitative analysis appear to in dicate slightly more prescriptions having been issued to participan ts in the placebo group (odds ratio (OR) 1.81, P value < 0.05) ( Clancy 1990 ;Tandon 1991 ;Tandon 2010 ), this conclusion remains un- convincing. There was also no reported follow-up regarding wha t effect antibiotics had on patients (that is, for instance, if the re was resolution of symptoms or reduction in carriage levels). The application of current therapeutic guidelines in the tria ls was similarly questionable, with the intentions and protocols f or pre- scribing antibiotics largely unclear and not reported in their meth- ods. It is understood that at least half of patients with chron ic bronchitis and COPD are persistently colonised hence a pos- itive sputum culture that is not necessarily indicative of an acu te infection and subsequent antibiotic prescription (in Tandon 2010 , 48% in the vaccinated group and 50% in the placebo group had a validated positive sputum culture). Normally in exacerbation so f COPD, sputum cultures would only be done if there was a failure of response to treatment or if the patient had repeated bacter ial ex- acerbations within several months. Nonetheless, these orga nisms may be responsible for more severe exacerbations, in which ant ibi- otics have been shown to be of benet. The aim of treatment with antibiotics in acute exacerbations should be to alleviate symp toms and reduce the volume of sputum rather than total elimination of colonising organisms. None of the trials specied the class of antibiotic therapy use d, nor did they explore sensitivities. This is important given tha t currently only amoxicillin and doxycycline regimes have been shown to be superior over other antibiotic classes, such as macrolides, wh ich fail to suppress H. influenzae (Longo 2011 ). Corticosteroid use was measured as an outcome in two trials (Clancy 2013 ;Tandon 2010 ).Clancy 2013 reported a median duration of ve treatment days (minimum 0, maximum 313) in the vaccine group and 10 days (minimum 0, maximum 306) in the placebo group. Tandon 2010 reported a 56% reduction in the proportion with acute exacerbations with corticosteroid tr eat- ment; for all episodes the proportion with recurrent exacerba tions was less than in the treated group (0.33 per participant compare d with 0.55 per participant, 40% reduction). Even though two studies reported the use of corticosteroids fo r the treatment of acute exacerbations, this does not preclude pa r- ticipants from receiving corticosteroids prior to and during th e studies. Many of the participants were admitted to hospital d uring the study period and were likely to have received a short course of systemic corticosteroids (in Clancy 2013 andTandon 2010 ,at o t a lof 83 participants in the vaccinated groups and 56 in the placebo groups). Short (not extended) courses of oral prednis(ol)one or intravenous hydrocortisone have been shown to shorten the du - ration of hospital admission and hasten return to previous l ung function and stable symptom control and are routinely used for severe exacerbations of COPD ( Longo 2011 ). ( Clancy 2013 ;Tandon 2010 ). There are limited data and information in the studies regarding participant hospitalisations; Analysis 2.2 demonstrates that those vaccinated were no more unlikely to be hospitalised (OR 0.96, 95% condence interval (CI) 0.13 to 7.04, P value = 0.01) based on a simple count of the number of participants hav- ing been hospitalised during the respective study period. Fu rther data parameters, such as length of hospital stay and intensiv e care versus general ward admission, would have been necessary for a more complete analysis. In the Tandon 2010 study, admissions to hospital were very high in the placebo group, with 11 admissions compared to one admissio n in the vaccination group. This demonstrates that those receivi ng the NTHi vaccine had the chance of hospital admission reduced by 90% (P value = 0.05). A similar outcome was noted in Clancy 2013 , showing a 50% reduction in hospital admissions following an acute exacerbation in the vaccine group (P value = 0.047). Any associated adverse side effects from the NTHi vaccination, measurable from symptomology and participant reports There was no clear denition of what constituted an adverse eff ect and therefore no consistency between the studies' reporting o fa d - verse events. For example, Tandon 1991 includes increase of dys- pnoea and cough as an adverse event, while Clancy 2013 reports mortality as a severe adverse event. Methods used for monito ring adverse events were not reported in any of the trials. Thus th ere is potentially an under-reporting of less severe side effects. N o clear comparisons or conclusions could be reached regarding any asso- ciation between adverse effects and therapeutic effect. The ad verse effects presented in the trials may well have been attributab le to the signicant comorbidity of the patient rather than to the va c- cine. T o discern whether these symptoms or adverse effects were true side effects of the vaccine or whether they were sequelae of the patient's disease process was not possible in this review as in- sufcient primary study data were available. Quality of life Only two studies reported quality of life (QoL) measures ( Clancy 2013 ;Tandon 1991 ), and these trials used different measurement 22 Haemophilus influenzae oral vaccination for preventing acute exacerbations of chr onic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.tools, limiting comparisons that could be made between the re- sults. It is also notable that, by nature, the measurement of qual- ity of life is subjective and difcult to quantify; neither stu dies provided further data and information regarding which aspect of QoL was most improved. Nonetheless, both trials report at le ast a two-point improvement in patient QoL in the vaccinated groups versus placebo. Improvement in QoL was based on overall clinica l condition assessed at the start of the trial and at set points d uring the trial. These intervals were slightly different between the two trials, with Tandon 1991 measuring at six months and Clancy 2013 measuring at three and six months. Clancy 2013 did not provide data on QoL for participants over 65 years of age. Overall completeness and applicability of evidence Although the number and size of the studies were low, all the t ri- als included participants with established chronic obstructiv ep u l - monary disease (COPD) or chronic bronchitis. Clancy 2013 was the only study with sufcient sample size to conduct subgroup analyses that assessed the effects of the vaccine in patients le ss than 65 years of age. The majority of studies (with the exceptio n ofLehmann 1991 , which was conducted in Papua New Guinea) were conducted in an Australian population. However, trial le ngth and follow-up periods varied from three to 12 months among the trials. The majority of the studies administered the HI-164 o ral vaccine enteric-coated tablets (two per day), which each contained 45 mg active substance of formalin-inactivated NTHi, which was compared with enteric-coated placebo tablets (with the exception ofClancy 1985 , which used a sodium tauroglycocholate substi- tute for the placebo). All studies had comparable objectives tha t assessed the vaccine's effect on acute COPD exacerbations. We consider the results of this review to be applicable to patie nts with established COPD. Quality of the evidence Overall, the methodological quality of the trials was acceptab le with most reporting methods of random sequence generation an d allocation concealment sufciently to assess them as adequate. The greatest limitation of the included studies is that of the six trials one is by far the largest in terms of included population. The smal ler studies were underpowered and even when pooling the ve smal ler studies, their weighting is inferior to that of the one large rt r i a l (Clancy 2013 ). The assessment of primary outcomes of acute exacerbations was carried out through respiratory questionnaires, which are su bjec- tive, instead of using objective measures such as spirometry. Other secondary outcomes, such as H. influenzae colonisation and an- tibiotic use, are more objective measurements but may be dif cultto measure. Studies had low rates of losses to follow-up and at tri- tion rates were low and equal in both arms of the trials. There is a moderate degree of heterogeneity to be found in thi s meta-analysis, specically in the outcome that measures the num - ber of acute exacerbations of COPD (I2statistic = 57%, P value = 0.04). Clancy 1985 appears to contribute most to the hetero- geneity; its exclusion from the analysis dramatically reduces het- erogeneity (I2statistic = 24% and P value = 0.26) and can likely be attributed to the study's reported result of only one exacerb ation in the vaccinated group. Nonetheless, the exclusion of Clancy 1985 from the meta-analysis did not appear to have a signicant impa ct on the overall result, given the small study size of approxim ately 30 patients and the robustness of the data sourced from the re- maining studies. Potential biases in the review process T wo review authors conducted all data selection and extraction independently, with a third author acting as an arbiter, in or der to minimise the risk of error and bias. One of the authors (AC) was involved as an investigator in four of the six included tri als (Clancy 1985 ;Clancy 1990 ;Clancy 2013 ;Lehmann 1991 ), but not involved in the data extraction and analysis in the review in order to reduce interpretation bias. It is possible that despite extensive searching we may have mi ssed a trial. However, this is very unlikely as one of the review aut hors is a world-renowned expert in the eld and has consulted his extens ive network to search for additional unpublished data. Therefor e, we think that we have captured all available evidence in this revi ew. Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews This is an update of a previously withdrawn Cochrane review of the same title ( Foxwell 2006 ). The authors of the previous review concluded that the vaccine was efcacious in reducing 20% to 30% of acute exacerbations in COPD patients and supported its use clinically. They also concluded that there was a need for larg er clinical trials to assess longer-term prognosis. Since publicat ion of the previous review a new trial with a substantially larger p opu- lation has been published ( Clancy 2013 ), and we have been able to include this in our updated meta-analysis. As a result of the inclusion of this large trial the validity of the review has in creased and the conclusions have changed substantially. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS 23 Haemophilus influenzae oral vaccination for preventing acute exacerbations of chr onic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Implications for practice This review analysed six trials of monobacterial whole, kill ed, non- typeable H. influenzae (NTHi) vaccine in patients experiencing recurrent acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Our results do not support the use of the vaccine in reducing the number and severity of exacerbations. Implications for research Future trials should address the long-term effects of the NTHi oral vaccine. It would be useful to assess further both the outcomes a t 12 months and two years following the initial vaccination, alo ng- side gathering data on mortality, age and other contributing fac- tors. It may also be useful to assess the effect of regular (seas onal) vaccination over a longer period of time. Careful standardisa tion of the measurement protocols is necessary for consistent analy ses for outcomes in the areas of number of acute infective exacer- bations, severity of exacerbations, carriage levels of H. influenzae and associated microbiology, hospital admissions and prescri ption of antibiotics and corticosteroids. As polymerase chain reactio n (PCR) is becoming more widely used in the diagnosis of infec- tion, it may have a role in future research given the limitatio ns of cultures, especially for micro-organisms such as H. influenzae , which are difcult to serotype. Future studies should more clea rly assess and consider the use of antibiotics and steroids in COPD patients with H. influenzae , as these are common therapies that have a signicant influence on mortality and morbidity, alongs ide bronchodilators, oxygen therapy and ventilatory support. The concept that COPD is a chronic condition with a peak in- cidence of diagnosis in patients aged between 50 and 60 years of age means that patients involved already have well-establis hed air-way disease. Whilst the inclusion criteria for this review and t ri- als concerning this vaccine specied those already diagnosed wit h COPD, it is equally important to assess the potential benet so f vaccinating patients with a pre-disposition to developing COP D (for example, younger populations of heavy smokers with mild air- way disease that have not reached a chronic condition yet). Futur e research should therefore also be directed at assessing the ef fects ofH. influenzae oral vaccination in high-risk populations not yet diagnosed with COPD, as a means of establishing the prophyla c- tic capabilities of such a vaccine. The projected annual cost of COPD in the United States will in- crease from USD 176.8 to USD 832.9 billion in the next 20 years, with the majority of direct costs attributed to acute exacerbati ons (Lee 2006 ). As COPD is a non-curable disease, any cost-effective intervention to prevent exacerbations would be worth furthe rr e - search, considering the rising global prevalence and nancial b ur- den of treatment on the health system.

However, insufcient respiratory questionnaires were completed during the study to allow for a nalysis of the data collected. In accordance with recent draft guidance for industry for developing drugs for treatme nt of COPD issued by the FDA in November 2007, assessment of modication or prevention of exacerbations of d isease can include severity of exacerbations as a primary efcacy endpoint. This can be based on worsening of symptoms req uiring changes in treatment or requiring urgent treatment or hospitalisation. On a post hoc basis, rates of h ospitalisation, corticosteroid use and a review of the medications used to treat the episodes of acute bronchitis were all analysed as measures of severity of episodes ACTRN12606000076572 2013 Methods Participants will be randomly allocated to active tablets each co ntaining 45 mg HI-1-164-AS (inactivated non- typeable Haemophilus influenzae ).

Professor Mieke van Driel and Professor Allan Cripps provid ed expert and methodological advice, including extensive help and suppo rt during the drafting of the protocol and review. DECLARATIONS OF INTEREST Professor Allan Cripps was involved in the initial animal wo rk and conduct of the four trials in Newcastle, Australia. The com mercial product, 'Bronchostat', which originated from these trials, i s no longer commercially available. The commercial companies Aus pharm International Limited and subsequently Cortecs Internatio nal Limited have ceased trading and were delisted from the Aus tralian Stock Exchange (ASX) in 1991 and 1998 respectively. Prior to 1996, Pro fessor Cripps acted as a consultant for both Auspharm Internat ional Limited and Cortecs International Limited. Hunter Immunolo gy Limited subsequently continued development of the oral wh ole cell vaccine (HI-164). In 2004 Professor Cripps acquired a small stock ho lding in the company. In 2011, Hunter immunology Limited was acquired by Bioxyne Limited and his shares were transferr ed to Bioxyne Limited. Subsequently, in February 2014 Bioxy ne Limited sold to Mariposa Health Limited, the HI-164 Oral Vaccine project and all associated intellectual property. Should Mariposa He alth Limited successfully commercialise the vaccine, Mariposa Health Limited have agreed to pay Bioxyne Limited a Royalty of up to 6 .5% of gross revenue. Professor Cripps retains a small residual stock holding in Bioxyne Limited. Professor Cripps has no sto ck holding in 47 Haemophilus influenzae oral vaccination for preventing acute exacerbations of chr onic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration.

External sources No sources of support supplied DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PROTOCOL AND REVIEW Risk ratios have been included as a method of measuring the tre atment effect for dichotomous data given as rates. We have amen ded theData synthesis to reflect that we have also used the xed-effect model to pool stu dy data that reported events as rates. Prescriptions of corticosteroids were not an outcome measure in any of the included studies and therefore not part of this revi ew's analyses. However, patients were noted to have been prescrib ed steroids prior to commencing the trial and may have continued steroids or have been further prescribed steroids during the trial per iods without clear reporting in the studies (this is discussed i nt h e Summary of main results ). Number of hospital admissions was added to Secondary outcomes as part of the assessment of the severity of exacerbations aft er post hoc analysis revealed that a number of studies reported hosp ital admissions. 48 Haemophilus influenzae vaccination for preventing acute exacerbations of chr onic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration.
