Description Mistletoe therapy is becoming more recognised as a viable treatment for cancer. The mistletoe plant contains several compounds including lectins which improve immune defences and can decrease the negative effects of cancer treatments. As a therapy, mistletoe represents a rediscovery of ancient wisdom and shows us how the science of modern medicine might expand its reach and reconnect with a more human-centred medicine. This book condenses the information shared at a three-day practitioner training course hosted by the Physicians' Association for Anthroposophic Medicine, highlighting several key lectures. This book serves as a bridge between conventional oncology and the development of Integrative Medicine as an effective path in the treatment of cancer. This book is a valuable resource for medical practitioners who want to expand cancer treatment options for their patients, as well as informative background reading for anyone interested in alternative medicine.
