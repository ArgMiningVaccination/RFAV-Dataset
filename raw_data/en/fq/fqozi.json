But most of all, it concerns sick people seeking relief, otherwise known as patients. Hundreds of top doctors and scientists heard from one of those patients, [Theresa Blanda](https://www.cirm.ca.gov/our-progress/stories-hope-leukemia), at an annual meeting at [UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center](https://cancer.ucsd.edu/Pages/default.aspx) on Thursday. Her message to the doctors: Patients who won't give up want doctors who also won't give up. Blanda came close to death recently from her blood cancer. Some doctors advised her to seek out a hospice for palliative care. In other words, to stop fighting and accept death. She declined that advice. In fact, it annoyed her. On Thursday, about a month after being discharged from the hospital, Blanda described how she survived. She shared her story at the cancer center's 11th annual symposium on translational oncology, the field of hastening scientific discoveries from the lab to the clinic for patients who are running out of options. While most of the presentations were given by researchers on complicated scientific issues, Blanda was there to remind everyone that the ultimate goal of all their research is to help patients get well. Her talk also underscored the importance of commercializing that research -- one of the drugs that helped her survive was developed as a result of collaborations fueled at a previous Moores symposium and initially tested by a San Diego biotech company. Another reminder of the need to put patients first came from C. Randal Mills, president of California's stem cell agency. Mills told of his personal encounter with the inadvertent cruelty of clinical trials that succeed only if some of the placebo-taking patients die. Blanda's brush with death took place after the experimental drug that had kept her blood cancer in check was withdrawn under pressure from the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA acted because a handful out of a total of 803 patients treated internationally developed rare and serious brain swellings called [Wernicke's encephalopathy](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/794583-overview). Without the drug, her health began to regress. After having a seizure, she was rushed to the intensive care unit. Backed morally and medically by her inpatient medical team and her hematologist, Catriona Jamieson of UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center, Blanda struggled to stay alive until another experimental drug became available. \"I kept saying, where's the drug?\" Blanda recounted asking Jamieson. \"She said, it's coming, we're getting it together. And they did, in a hurry ... I'm feeling great and hoping to feel better,\" Blanda said, with Jamieson beaming by her side. Blanda, 64, said she's feeling well enough to contemplate another life-changing event: marriage to her high school sweetheart. Jamieson spoke of what Blanda's experience meant, particularly the need for doctors to match their patients' will to live. \"She was asked by many physicians why don't you consider hospice. I don't think that's OK,\" Jamieson said. \"I think the best palliative care is curative care. So I'm throwing down the gauntlet. I think we can do better. And patients like Theresa expect better, just like we would.\" Blanda originally had [polycythemia vera](https://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/myeloproliferative/Patient/page3), a slow-growing malignancy of blood-forming stem cells. It causes causes abnormal proliferation of red blood cells and several nasty symptoms, including [an immensely swollen spleen](https://www.bloodjournal.org/content/122/21/4047?sso-checked=true) that makes it hard to eat. It can also lead to leukemia. A slow cancer An Orange County resident, Blanda received treatment for several years at City of Hope. For several years her disease was stable. But in 2008, her cancer had progressed to a more advanced blood cancer called myelofibrosis, a kind of leukemia. She sought a bone marrow transplant, but couldn't find a suitable donor. She then asked about clinical trials, and was referred to Jamieson. That was just in time to be enrolled to test the experimental drug [fedratinib](https://ash.confex.com/ash/2013/webprogram/Paper57427.html). The TargeGen drug inhibits the activity of a mutant form of a gene called JAK2. It is based on Jamieson's research that discovered the role of JAK2 in cancer cells. Her research was partly funded by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, underscoring the close connection between the behavior of [stem cells and cancer cells](https://ludwigcenter.stanford.edu/overview/theory.html). Cancer is known to [co-opt some of the mechanisms stem cells use to fuel their uncontrolled growth](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3263309/). Fedratinib was originally developed by San Diego-based TargeGen, which drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis [purchased in 2010](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/spree-sanofi-scoops-targegen-635m-deal/2010-06-30) for to $635 million. \"I was right on the cusp of full-blown leukemia -- [blast](https://www.haematologica.org/content/93/12/1765), everything. And she took me on,\" Blanda said. \"I had a swollen knee and I still don't know what that is,\" Blanda said. \"Extramedullary hematopoiesis,\" Jamieson interjected, smiling. In English, Blanda's proliferating blood-forming stem cells had migrated out of her bones. \"I got into the clinical trial, one of the first to receive the TargeGen drug,\" Blanda said. \"That went on for about five years. I did really well. I had an amazing recovery within a matter of a couple of months. Everything, spleen, liver, back to normal. I went back to work. And everything went along OK, until the drug got pulled.\" In November, 2013, Sanofi [withdrew fedratinib from a Phase 3 trial](https://www.drugs.com/clinical_trials/sanofi-drops-late-stage-cancer-16333.html) under FDA pressure because of the complications. Jamieson and other physicians pleaded in vain to keep the drug available for those like Blanda who were responding. \"The FDA said you have stop, and find a mechanism for this (side effect), Jamieson said. \"The company decided it seemed like too important a side effect to continue development. So they elected not to develop it further. But then patients who had actually been responding began to progress.\" While there is an FDA-approved JAK2 inhibitor, it's not as potent as fedratinib, Jamieson said. \"I had quite a few patients on the (experimental) JAK2 inhibitor who progressed on the slightly wimpier drug. So we started to look for new treatment options for them.\" Without the drug, Blanda relapsed, leading to her hospitalization. Attempts to stabilize her with various combinations of other drugs failed. Search for options \"This last year has been a tough one,\" Blanda said. \"I got sicker and sicker. My spleen got bigger and bigger. And my liver started acting up. And before I knew it, I landed down here at the hospital, in November. Everything was out of whack. I constantly needed platelets because they were being chewed up by the spleen.\" At last, a replacement drug became available for experimental use, [pacritinib](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fda-grants-fast-track-designation-to-cti-biopharmas-pacritinib-a-novel-jak2-inhibitor-for-the-treatment-of-myelofibrosis-2014-08-07). The FDA rushed to give its approval, Jamieson said in an interview after the symposium. \"The FDA got the paperwork on a Friday, via fax, at 5:30 p.m. They issued a temporary investigational new drug application at 6:30 p.m. -- Pacific time. So that was 9:30 p.m. their time, so she could get the drug on a Monday.\" Once again, the cancer was brought under control, and Blanda was able to leave the hospital. \"I'm doing very well,\" Blanda said. \"I've had no side effects on this drug.\" There's even more good news, UCSD Moores researcher David Cheresh told Blanda at the symposium: fedratinib is coming back, saved by a group of investors that decided to try again. \"We hope we're less than six months away from the NDA (New Drug Application), based on a lot of work and research and work that has been done by a lot of people, including Cat (Jamieson) ... We hope by the end of the summer we'll see an NDA for that drug and you'll be able to take that drug once again.\" In an after-talk interview, Blanda said she's committed to continuing to fight her cancer. \"I'm not giving up,\" she said. \"I've come too long, too far. There are people who are working to give me my life back, and I'm not "}
