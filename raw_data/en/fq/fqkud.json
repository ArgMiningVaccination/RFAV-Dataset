MEET THE DOCTOR Dr. George Shoemaker has been helping people live pain free since 1980 in his office at 3384 Easton Ave., Bethlehem, PA 18020. As a chiropractor with 35 years of experience, he is committed to promoting health and a drug-free life. It is a pleasure to welcome you to our website, and we hope you learn more about chiropractic and our office. My personal journey with chiropractic began at age 14 when I was experiencing [daily headaches,](https://www.shoemakerchirocenter.com/need-spinal-adjustment-bethlehem) which were relieved with aspirin and a nap. My mother, a registered nurse, took me to her chiropractor to see if he could alleviate my headaches. After a brief examination, he expained that he would remove nerve pressure at the base of my skull by adjusting the top of the neck bone. His adjustment worked. Having no more headaches was a near miracle. By the summer of 1975, I began my studies leading to my chiropractic degree, know as a DC. During my schooling at the Palmer College of Chiropractic, I played rugby as a \"hooker,\" a position similar to a \"center\" in american football. Our team became the National Rugby Collegiate Champions in 1978-1979. That championship was a great experience and memory I will always treasure. After graduating in and obtaining a Pennsylvania license in 1980, I opened my first practice in Hellertown, PA, then eventually moved to Bethlehem, PA. My wife, Esther, and I have lived in Lower Saucon since 1985. We enjoy living in the Lehigh Valley and helping others reach better health through [chiropractic care](https://www.shoemakerchirocenter.com/need-spinal-adjustment-bethlehem), exercise classes, and healthful lifestyle choices. Dr. Shoemaker has been a licensed Chiropractor since 1980.
