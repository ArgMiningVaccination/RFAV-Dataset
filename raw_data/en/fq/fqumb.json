Our bodies have a natural ability to heal. Energetic blocks, which show up in our bodies as symptoms, prevents our bodies from healing with ease. From the lens of the mind-body-spirit connection, dis-ease and dis-comfort is viewed as physical manifestations deeply rooted in unaddressed experiences. Symptoms of illnesses stem from unprocessed emotions, thoughts and beliefs. A body free of blockages feels fully vitalized, balanced and flowing freely. Common indicators of energy blocks are illnesses, disease (or dis-ease) and symptoms that go along with them. How are illnesses, diseases and physical symptoms related to energy healing? In the field of energy medicine, disease and discomfort are believed to appear because of unresolved thoughts, emotions, beliefs and/or experiences. When something brings us trauma, pain or wounds either mentally or emotionally, they create a block around our energetic pathways. If these emotional or mental energetic blocks remain unaddressed for long periods of time, they develop and manifest into our physical body and present as symptoms that often don't make sense or have no explanation of occurring. Illness is an indication that we are out of balance in some capacity and will first appear as a block in our energy field. When an illness is unaddressed, it'll affect the body's ability to heal on a physical, emotional, mental and/or spiritual level. Energy healing can help to remove blockages that keep your energy from being stuck or stagnant. An energy healing practitioner can help you bring your body back into alignment to create optimal conditions that allows your own body to heal itself the way it was designed to.
