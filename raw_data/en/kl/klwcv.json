It is based on several fundamental principles that make it a unique and complete therapeutic approach. The first principle is the life force of the plant . Buds and embryonic tissues are particularly rich in nutrients and active principles, as well as in vital energy. This energy is at its peak in young shoots, which makes gemmotherapy particularly effective in stimulating the body's self-healing processes. The second principle is the notion of homeopathy . The bud extracts are diluted in water and alcohol to increase their effectiveness while minimizing side effects. These homeopathic dilutions make it possible to increase the power of the extracts of buds and to reinforce their action on the body. The third principle is synergy between plants . Bud extracts from different plants can be combined to form synergistic remedies, which work synergistically to enhance their effectiveness. These combinations can be tailored to the specific needs of each patient based on their symptoms and overall health. The fourth principle is the stimulation of the body's self-healing processes . Gemmotherapy is considered an alternative medicine that stimulates the body's self-healing processes by strengthening its immune system and promoting tissue regeneration. It can be used to treat a wide variety of ailments, such as digestive disorders, sleep disorders, hormonal disorders, and chronic illnesses. Finally, the fifth principle is the individualization of treatment . Each patient is unique and requires personalized treatment. The remedies used in gemmotherapy are selected according to the specific needs of each patient according to their symptoms and their general state of health. This individualized approach leads to more effective and lasting results. In summary, gemmotherapy is a holistic and comprehensive therapeutic approach that uses the healing properties of buds and plant embryonic tissues to stimulate the body's self-healing processes .
