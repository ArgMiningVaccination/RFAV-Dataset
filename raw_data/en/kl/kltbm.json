NOT-FUN events occur - when life seems out of balance and emotions are running amok - when you know you've done everything to heal, yet your body, thoughts, and feelings keep returning to the same old painful patterns. Sound familiar? During these times, it feels safest to curl up in a ball under the covers and hope all those troubles go away on their own. In fact, during times like these, who would even consider celebrating or trying to look on the \"bright side.\" Is there even a bright side? Ceremony will help you. There can be room for celebration. And in those NOT-FUN times, having a ceremony, especially a healing and blessing ceremony, can help you remember that there IS something to celebrate. Why Ceremony for NOT-FUN stuff? Allowing yourself to experience ceremony during or following the NOT-FUN times helps you recover and return to balance. The sacred connection that comes through ceremony takes you back to your center and the remembrance of wholeness. After a purely sacred experience, you return to your child-like heart and innocence. You remember the feeling of trust again. And when that happens, the idea of celebrating feels like a more natural part of life. You end up feeling so much better, clear-hearted, creative, and on track with your life's purpose. Ceremonies help with many NOT-FUN life situations. Physical and Emotional Pain - Your physical pain has its roots in past emotionally painful events. You've had treatment for your condition and believe it should have healed by now, yet it keeps coming back. Grief and Loss - It's been over a year since your loved one passed away, yet the sadness is still as fresh as ever. You're wondering why you cannot move on. Emotional Imbalance - You are feeling sad, or \"blah,\" and you aren't sure what to do about it. Some emotions are wildly running amok, while other emotions run so deep that you can't access them. Something is missing - You have this funny feeling that something is missing, and you don't know what it is. All you know is the emptiness inside. Life and Spiritual Purpose - Your purpose has lost its zest for life, or you've never even known your life's purpose. You are looking for a way to connect to a higher source but have not yet found what you need in your family's spiritual path. You need answers! Life Pattern Disruption - Something in life seems out of whack. You have that feeling of \"I just don't know what has gotten into me, and weird things are happening.\" Bumped - Life was cruising along until you hit a bump, and now you need to find your way back to your purpose again. Sugar and junk food Addiction - In most ways, you are moderate in your habits and take care of yourself. Yet, lately, with sugar and other \"junk\" foods, you feel unusually compelled. Being so out of control like this has got you puzzled. Experience the sacred. Imagine walking along ancient stone steps carved into the side of a mountain. It's warm with just a hint of a cool breeze as you walk along, hearing the sounds of nature and feeling the solid ground beneath your feet. Up ahead, you see a plateau with a beautiful grassy meadow, and you quicken towards it, along the way hearing the call of a small but wise mountain stone. The stone welcomes you to pick it up, and you do. You discover a place where a soft, plush blanket nestles into the grassy bed in the meadow. Relaxing into it is inevitable, as is feeling the sun warming your whole body. The cool breeze whispers, and the fragrances of flowers and herbs invite you into beloved memories. It is comfortable here, being gently yet solidly held by the sacred earth. It is so quiet that you can hear your own heart as it beats in rhythm to the sound of the land's living orchestra and the gentle rise and fall of your breath. From far away, you hear a soft chorus of cicadas rattling their song. A timeless feeling arises within you. Slowly tensions dissolve, and old stories begin to rewrite themselves automatically. You are coming home to the Sacred within. It is easy now to stay curious about what happens next. You are welcome here. These ceremonies are inclusive and compatible with all religions and spiritual paths. It's also a good idea to mention that you'll never need plant medicine for any of the ceremonies, and they are entirely substance-free. Feel more grounded, whole, inspired, and at peace when you experience the sacred through Healing and Blessing Ceremonies. "}
