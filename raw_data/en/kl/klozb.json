The creators of CLEAN SLATE utilized exclusive, patent-pending methods to activate the utility processes that convert nature's potent source into bioavailable silica, enriched with trace minerals and vitamin C. The innovative product is composed of a combination of powerful ingredients that promote a superior level of bioavailability, safety, and efficacy. These ingredients work synergistically to facilitate passive cleansing of the body and stimulate pathways for healing and regeneration at a systemic level. To understand how ROOT Clean Slate works to detoxify and heal the body, it is important to first understand the role of the liver in the body's natural detoxification process. The liver is the body's primary detoxification organ, responsible for filtering toxins and waste products from the blood and eliminating them from the body. When the liver is overburdened with toxins or is not functioning properly, it can lead to a variety of health problems. ROOT Clean Slate is an all-natural detox product that is designed to help the body rid itself of toxins and promote overall health and wellness. The product contains a blend of natural ingredients which have been traditionally used for their detoxifying and cleansing properties. By supporting liver function, promoting the elimination of toxins from the body, and providing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory support, ROOT Clean Slate may help to improve overall health and wellness. As with any dietary supplement, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using ROOT Clean Slate or making significant changes to your diet or lifestyle. Learn more about "}
