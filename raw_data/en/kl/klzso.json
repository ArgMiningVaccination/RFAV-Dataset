Below are some videos of recent simulations. Simulations of COVID-19 Spike protein during membrane fusion (Dodero-Rojas, Onuchic and Whitford, eLife, 2021) Educational video generated in part by the simulations of Dodero-Rojas, Onuchic and Whitford, eLife 2021. Simulations of COVID-19 vaccine delivery (Staquicini Biophysica, 2021) Simulations of a complete viral capsid (Whitford, Jiang and Serwer, Viruses, 2020) Simulations of large-scale domain rearrangements in EF-Tu (Yang, Perrier and Whitford, Proteins, 2018) Simulation of subunit rotation in the ribosome (Levi, et al.
