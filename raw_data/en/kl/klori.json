Parker1 1Northeastern University,2Boston University School {stowell.e, oleary.t, kimani.e}@husky.neu.edu, mpo@bu.edu, {t.bickmore, a.parker}@northeastern.edu ABSTRACT Churches play a major role in providing social support to ad- dress health inequities within Black communities, in part by connecting members to key organizations and services. While public health has a history of disseminating interventions in faith communities, little work has explored the use of crowd- sourcing to tailor interventions to the unique culture of each church community. Following Community Based Participa- tory Research principles, we partnered with two predominantly Black churches, and report on a series of three participatory design sessions with nine participants. We developed a novel storyboarding method to explore how crowdsourcing could promote health in these faith-based communities. Our ndings characterize existing supports within the church community, and how church social structures impact member access to these supports. We further identify motivations to engage with a church-situated health application, and how these motiva- tions translate to crowdsourcing tasks. Finally, we discuss considerations for public health crowdsourcing tasks.

People who identify as African American suffer a disproportionate burden from major chronic diseases [21, 35, 16, 11, 17, 36], and have a lower Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for prot or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the rst page.

Church commu- nities thus represent an important source of social support for African Americans [32]. This potential for social support is an affordance of faith-based contexts for health promotion, given the importance of informational, emotional, and instrumental support during health behavioral change efforts. Additional affordances include the existing health ministry initiatives (i.e., church-led programs designed to promote wellness), rich community-based resources, and frequent and regular oppor- tunities for member interactions (e.g., Sunday service, Bible study groups) [6]. Prior work has used participatory methods to explore how technology can support spiritual practices. This body of work demonstrates how technology can support spiritual prac- tices [43], extend religious experiences into the context of daily life [42], and facilitate shared interactions at a geographic dis- tance [37]. However, limited work has explored how technol- ogy, developed in a religious or spiritual context, can promote health and wellness [23]. Most of this work has relied on text messaging-based interventions to disseminate health promo- tion messages, with little work investigating more innovative ways for technology to build upon the rich social infrastructure within church communities. While there are distinct benets to embedding a health tech- nology intervention into faith-based contexts, designers must ensure that these interventions reflect the community's priori- ties and needs [34]. Designing an intervention for a community with long-term membership poses challenges to engagement. Such interventions require a large quantity of content that is not only culturally relevant, but also continuously updates and evolves with the community. One mechanism for creating and continuously updating socially-relevant content that reflects the values of the intended church community is crowdsourc- ing. Crowdsourcing, as a production model, gives community members an opportunity to creatively author content, perhaps even more effectively than domain experts [4]. To our knowl- edge, crowdsourcing has not been used within faith-based communities for health promotion. Crowdsourcing initiatives have largely been used in public health interventions to en-hance content [10], provide timely health feedback [41], de- liver health information, and provide social support [7, 18]. Our research extends this prior work into the context of faith- based settings. Specically, we investigate how crowdsourcing can be used to harness the collective power of church com- munities to create socially-relevant and meaningful content, tailored to users' specic cultural needs. As an initial foray into this space, we conducted community- based participatory research (CBPR) with participants from two predominantly Black churches. We report on a subsec- tion of our formative work: three storyboard participatory design sessions in which participants designed mobile health (mHealth) interventions that leveraged a range of crowdsourc- ing techniques in their church communities. Our work is guided by the following questions: 1) What resources do church members seek in a faith-based health application? 2) How does the church context and culture impact access to these resources? 3) What motivates church members to partic- ipate in crowdsourcing within their faith communities? Our participants were motivated to connect with peers in their church community using an mHealth application, and found crowdsourcing and mHealth technologies acceptable within the church-setting. We contribute directions for future work focused on faith-based health technologies, including further investigation of how crowdsourcing tasks can be tailored to values of spirituality and fellowship. RELATED WORK Black churches in the U.S. have a strong tradition of social action and community outreach aimed at addressing inequities faced by their congregation and the surrounding communi- ties [26, 32, 40]. They are often the most visible and respected organizations in the African American community [6]. Be- cause of this tradition, Black churches have long been a focal point in public health efforts to reduce health disparities that exist between African Americans and other ethnic groups [5]. In 2001, President Bush established the White House Ofce of Faith-based and Community Initiatives, which continues today to direct funds to such organizations for health pro- gramming [20, 31]. However, this focus on community-based health promotion has not yet been translated to technology- facilitated interventions. A 2018 systematic review of mHealth interventions in vulnerable populations (including racial and ethnic minority groups), found that few mHealth interven- tions are grounded in a community context. Further, none of the mHealth interventions were situated in a faith-based community [38]. Our work explores the acceptability of a technology-based health intervention in a church-setting, and how crowdsourcing tasks may support church efforts in ad- dressing health inequities. Technology Use in Faith Communities While faith-situated health technology has not been explored in the eld of HCI, technology used to engage in spiritual or religious practices, often termed techno-spiritual practices, is a burgeoning eld of study. This work aims to understand how technology can help religious users enrich their faith without disrupting core beliefs [1]. This body of work largelyexplores how technology can support personal spiritual prac- tices [42] and create spiritual experiences [1], and how technol- ogy transforms church worship when integrated into religious services [44]. Various information and communication technologies have been designed to support a variety of religions and religious practices. These systems support Islamic pilgrimages [25] and Muslim and Christian prayer [1, 43], connect members to their religious communities even when separated by distance [37], and support the mindfulness practices of Pentocostal users during the course of their daily lives [42]. This work has found that, even in social contexts where technology adoption may seem antithetical to spirituality, technology can enhance spiritual practices and may even be welcomed in faith-situated contexts when designed with intended constituents. In a study of technology use in megachurch services, Wyche et al. found that large displays are well-accepted as a means for increasing efciency during worship services; however, the acceptability of other forms of technology in these spaces, in- cluding personal technologies, are constrained by both church infrastructure and the personal preferences of community members and religious leaders [44]. Wyche et al.'s work demonstrates the need to identify the unique social structures, technology preferences, as well as distinct infrastructures that could potentially augment or constrain technology integration. Our work extends the eld of techno-spiritual practices, wherein we explore how technology can leverage strengths within a faith community to accomplish additional church goals (e.g., promoting constituent health) in predominantly Black protestant churches. To our knowledge, no work in HCI has examined the intersection of techno-spiritual practices and wellness technology. In each of these techno-spiritual exam- ples, community member input was critical to the success of the design. Therefore, crowdsourcing in a faith-based app has the potential to create ownership and empowerment in the health tech intervention which helps to sustain engage- ment. Crowdsourcing initiatives present an opportunity to tailor content to the unique culture of a church. Crowdsourcing for Health Crowdsourcing is an efcient means of collecting and enhanc- ing user-generated contributions, allowing networked commu- nities to provide information, resources, and creatively author content to solve problems [3, 7, 28]. In public health research, crowdsourcing has the potential to empower community mem- bers to become directly involved in the development of health promotion strategies and solutions [4]. Like other types of community engagement research, involving community mem- bers ultimately can enhance public health interventions and programming to reflect the underlying principles, values, and beliefs of the target community [4]. This is particularly crit- ical within the church context, where practices, preferences, and priorities vary even between churches of the same denom- ination. In optimal cases, crowdsourcing has the potential to leverage the strengths of community members in order to identify and alleviate existing problems.The following public health crowdsourcing typology catego- rizes four major crowdsourcing tasks suitable for different types of public health challenges: the Knowledge Discovery and Management approach (KDM), Distributed Human Intel- ligence Tasking approach (DHIT), Peer-vetted and Broadcast Search approach [4]. A KDM approach tasks the community with gathering rele- vant information and storing it in a common location. This approach is appropriate for information management prob- lems that require a central repository, accessible to community members [4]. KDM is particularly benecial to minority com- munities because the information generated from others within the target community is inherently tailored to the community needs. For example, Kumar et al. utilized a centralized discus- sion forum for individuals with HIV/AIDS to share and seek information [22]. In a DHIT approach, community members use specic param- eters to process small segments of centrally-stored information. Typically, this technique is useful when attempting to synthe- size large amounts of data that cannot be easily or reliably done automatically [4]. For example, DHIT has been used in numerous dietary tools to provide timely feedback on calorie totals or relative healthiness of digital images of food [41, 27] and to build databases of nutritional information of foods and their dietary alternatives [10]. DHIT has also been lever- aged in chronic pain management where both experts and non-experts provide and rate solutions [18]. These studies demonstrate how DHIT techniques can leverage collective wisdom to provide timely feedback. PVCP approach is an appropriate use of crowdsourcing when solutions to a problem rely on the preferences and attitudes of community members outside of the external stakeholders. Here, community members or crowdworkers are asked to give valuable insights and knowledge. Those insights will ultimately determine the solution and its implementation [4]. PVCP is easily demonstrated in urban planning projects which seek public feedback or public design contributions. Addition- ally, PVCP has been used to facilitate volunteer efforts during a hurricane using Slack, a collaborative software tool [7]. Broadcast Search [4] is a request posed to the community for an empirically provable solution to a problem. Conrad, et al. discuss the implementation of Broadcast Search to remotely access domain experts in crisis situations. These systems broadcast a need for assistance with the aim of connecting to critical insight not readily available to volunteer teams [7]. While crowdsourcing has been applied in many public health domains, crowdsourcing techniques have yet to be designed to create tailored behavior change content for unique spiritual communities. In this work, we explore church member moti- vation and willingness to engage in crowdsourcing initiatives within their faith communities. METHOD This work is part of the formative rst year of a four year CBPR project to design, develop, and evaluate an mHealth intervention in predominantly Black church communities. The focus of our rst year was to work directly with communitymembers to identify community needs and strengths, and to engage church members in the participatory design of the mHealth application. In this paper, we report on a subset of the formative work. We conducted semi-structured interviews and participatory design sessions with nine participants to understand the unique challenges to health promotion that church members face, as well as how to leverage volunteer behavior prevalent within these church communities. In addi- tion, we conducted modular storyboard activities to identify crowdsourcing tasks appropriate for faith-based mHealth ap- plications. This process yielded crucial input from our partici- pants, resulting in the identication and discussion of potential crowdsourcing tasks. Participant Recruitment We partnered with an organization that provides resources to over a hundred faith organizations serving predominantly Black churches near our city in the Northeast U.S.. In our ndings, we refer to this organization as the 'partner organiza- tion.' This organization identied two churches to support the formative year of the project: Church A is a historical Baptist church with approximately 600 members. Church B is a more recently founded African Methodist Episcopal (AME) church with approximately 500 members. We worked closely with health ministry leaders from both churches to identify members of each community who could provide different perspectives and expertise regarding the strengths and needs of their respective church communities. Participants were eligible to participate in the formative work if they were 18 years or older, self-identied as a member of one of the two churches, were English-speaking, and owned a smartphone. We actively sought out participants with various levels of \"embeddedness\" in the church community to repre- sent a cross section of experiences reflected in the church laity. Participants were consented at the start of formative work by a project member. Prior to the sessions reported in this paper, participants had each engaged in ve focus groups of 2-3 hours each (11 hours total). One participant missed one, and one participant missed two of the prior ve focus groups. The rst four focus groups explored various dimensions of participant experiences in their church communities (e.g., religious practices, social support, health priorities, and technology use), helping us gain impor- tant context about the church communities before exploring concepts for technology-based interventions. The 5th focus group engaged participants in the design of preliminary con- cepts for a health app, allowing us to examine opportunities for app-based support as well as feature requirements important to the participants. Modular Storyboards To answer our research questions, we developed a modular sto- ryboard method. Our modular storyboards combine elements of two traditional storyboarding methods (i.e., a set storyboard versus a blank canvas), by presenting participants with the same overarching storyline [14] while also allowing them to customize, change and remove parts of the board [2]. The similar storylines facilitated participant comparison of eachFigure 1. Completed Wellness storyboard with customization options. others boards. Through the customizations, participants drove major design decisions and outcomes within the scenarios, re- sulting in end products that reflected their personal values and experiences. The storyboards explored participant attitudes toward, and preferences for, a health application used within the context of a church community, as well as motivations for contributing to the application using crowdsourcing. The storyboards depicted a ctional character's interactions with a church-based mHealth application at key points in their health journey. Storyboards were structured into three phases of the character's health journey: introduction to, seeking sup- port from, and contributing to the health app. The jumps in time probe the types of support a key informant would seek in the app, motivations to engage in crowdsourcing, and mo- tivations for longer-term app use. In previous focus groups, participants identied three health concerns and priorities for themselves and for their church communities: depression, joint pain, and wellness (focusing on physical activity (PA) and nu- trition). These health concerns were developed into three distinct storyboards, and allowed us to explore the unique di- mensions of each health journey. Participants were instructed to customize the storyboards in the following ways: \u000fStoryline Options (Figure 1A). Participants were instructed to choose from multiple storylines to explore different types of engagement with the application (e.g., including public vs private acknowledgements). Multiple storylines allowed for a contrast between options to test acceptance and feasibility of various design choices and edge cases. \u000fBlocks (Figure 1B). Participants were given four packets of blocks: social support and resources (e.g., free and discounted resources, preventive health information, and places to vent), people (e.g., health professionals, church leadership and laity, family), context (e.g., church service, downtime), and message blocks (e.g., health, inspirational, social). In the character's time of need, participants were encouraged to tape on blocks. Enabling participants to mix and match blocks allowed us to explore factors that mightDepression Testimonials Joint Pain Rated health messages Wellness Authored health messages - to individuals or community & Nominated scripture messages Table 1.

Participants were encouraged to create their own blocks if the existing blocks did not t their needs. \u000fFill in the Blank OR Multiple Choice (Figure 1C). At key plot points, the storyboards had multiple choice and ll in the blank sections to allow the participants to create a story that felt authentic to their own experiences. These customizations prompted for the character's reasoning and reactions to block choices and storyline options depicted in the storyboard. \u000fParticipants were additionally encouraged to customize the storyboards however they saw t, including to write directly on the storyboard. Procedure In this paper, we report on the storyboard design sessions, which included two individual storyboard focus groups, eight individual interviews, and two group storyboard focus groups for a total of 12 data collection sessions. Individual Storyboard Focus Groups: In the rst session, each participant customized their own individual storyboard. Par- ticipants chose from three different health scenarios. The storyboards took approximately 90 minutes to complete. Par- ticipants then presented their storyboards to the group and answered questions about the choices they made. At the end of the session, participants briefly discussed differences and similarities they saw in the storyboards. These sessions were 3 hours each. Interviews: Given the time constraint of the individual story- board focus groups, participants were invited to a follow-up1-on-1 interview where they walked through each decision they had made in the storyboard. Participants were further prompted to reflect on whether the storyboard they created was reflective of their personal experience and their preferences for engaging with a health promotion application. Each interview lasted 1 hour. Group Storyboard Focus Groups: In the third session, partici- pants worked in teams of two or three to complete a wellness storyboard to help achieve consensus around crowdsourcing tasks. We chose the wellness storyboard because it contained the greatest number of crowdsourcing tasks within one story- line, as well as content that sparked discussion in the previous sessions (e.g., nominating scripture, anchoring intervention content in church services.). The storyboards took approxi- mately 90 minutes to complete in groups. At the end of the session, each group presented their storyboard, and were asked to discuss differences and similarities in storyboard designs between groups. The group discussion gave participants an opportunity to insightfully challenge each others storyboard decisions, allowing them to explore design ideas more fully. These sessions were 2.5 hours each. Participants were compensated $24 per hour, for a total of $156 for the complete 6.5 hours. The Institutional Review Board at our university approved the study protocol. In this paper, we report upon the ndings from 4 focus groups (2 individual storyboard sessions, 2 group storyboard sessions) and 8 participant interviews. Analysis Interviews and focus groups were audio recorded and tran- scribed, resulting in a total of 11 hours and 10 minutes of audio les and 506 pages of transcription used. We conducted a thematic analysis of focus group content guided by our re- search questions with the aim of identifying design insights. In our analysis, we used elements of grounded theory analysis, including constant comparisons, axial and selective coding, and memo writing [39]. Using NVivo 12.5.0 software, two researchers inductively coded transcripts separately, labeling emergent phenomena in the data to arrive at a codebook. Two researchers then independently applied the codebook to par- ticipant transcripts, 9 individual storyboards, and 3 group storyboards. We met regularly during the analysis process to discuss discrepancies in the applications of the codes, reexam- ine the codebook, and reflect on contradictory data. Participant Overview Nine church members participated in the individual storyboard session, 4 from Church A and 5 from Church B. One member of Church B dropped out of the study for personal reasons before individual interviews and the group storyboard ses- sion. One member of Church A could not attend the group storyboard session. Demographics: All church-members self- identied as Black. 6 were female and 3 were male. Partici- pant ages ranged from 33 to 73. One participant had completed some high school, 2 had some college, 3 had a BS/BA, and 3 had advanced degrees. Church Engagement: Participants from Church A have been members for an average of 12 years (SD = 11.5, Range: 2-27), whereas participants from ChurchB have been members for an average of 4.5 years (SD = 2.4, Range: 2-7). They range from no involvement in any church afliated group or ministries to serving multiple roles in the church. These roles include attendee, ministry team leader, choir member, and trustee. FINDINGS In the individual storyboard session, 4 participants chose the joint pain board, 2 chose the depression board, and 3 chose the wellness board. In the group storyboard session, all 3 groups completed the wellness board. Through the storyboard activities, participants provided rich descriptions of types and sources of support they could benet from, existing resources and barriers to access in their church, and attitudes toward crowdsourcing tasks to address these barriers. In our nd- ings, we rst describe the strengths and challenges that church members perceive in their church communities, namely how privacy and need for condentiality can impede access to ex- isting peer and professional support. We then apply a public health crowdsourcing typology to contextualize participant motivation to engage in crowdsourcing tasks [4]. Our ndings extend previous work by illuminating attitudes and preferences for crowdsourcing tasks when designing a faith-based health technology. Accessing Community Professionals Health Experts : Health experts, including health liaisons (n=7) and practitioners (n=6), were described almost exclusively as a source of informational support. The need for information from a credible source was deemed critical at the beginning of a health journey (e.g, with a recent diagnosis) when one might not know what questions to ask. P7 explained that in her personal experience with surgery, \". . . the person who told me that [...] I absolutely wanted to go into rehab and not just go home. Um, was a health professional who was just, who had me think about something that I hadn't thought about. \" These health experts are particularly useful, in that they can anticipate informational needs. One of the differences between the churches was the make-up of the congregation. While Church A largely discussed health professionals as individuals from the surrounding communities, Church B noted that many members of the church work as health practitioners. In fact, P7 described how she leveraged this resource, \" I also have the advantage of, [some of our church leadership] are [health professionals]. . . I did talk with him a bit about [joint] surgery as well. \" However, even with medical professionals within the congregation, participants remain uncomfortable using fellowship or worship to approach these gatekeepers to health resources. As P6 stressed \" it's their day to worship with their families; this isn't the time or place, \" suggesting a concern that inquiries about health resources may interfere with a fellow church member's day of worship. Another participant added that just by publicly approaching a health professional in the congregation, one may inadvertently reveal some aspect of their health to the broader community. Church Leadership : Similar to the role of health experts, church leadership (e.g., pastors, ministers) were imagined to assume a less active role in the health application giventhat they tend to an entire congregation. In the group sto- ryboard session, church leadership was neither selected nor discussed as a direct source of support. In the individual sto- ryboards, only three participants chose church leadership as a source of support on the application. The church leadership block was always paired with the scripture-based message and emotional support blocks; however, this support was directed at the broader community as opposed to the individual. For example, P3 suggested that the Pastor's support on the app, \". . .doesn't even necessarily have to be specic, but it could just be like, 'hey, I posted a song in the app that, you know, really gave me some great motivation last week. So I just wanted to share it with you all. ' \" Similar to a Sunday sermon, a church leader can provide inspiration throughout the week with congregation-wide messages, even without knowing the details of each member's challenges. Even with numerous options for support to choose from, participants select support from church leadership that is commensurate with the support they currently receive face-to-face; reinforcing a place-based social relationship using computer mediated technology. When asked why P5 did not select church leadership within her board, she explained, \" I personally don't have time to call and say my woes to my pastor- or cry. I don't have time for that energy. But a friend or my prayer partner would know because we have that intimate time. \" P5 would rather vent to a friend who is up-to-date on her life than have to retell the entire story to her pastor. P5 described her hesitancy to accept a pastor's offer of support: \" I always feel that with [church] leadership, certain levels of leadership, there's other people that may need support more than I do. \" This participant viewed direct support from church leadership as reserved for those in desperate need. While she might benet from this support herself, taking up a church leader's time becomes an egocentric act. Even with experts within the congregation, church members face barriers accessing the support that they need. Church members require methods to connect to community experts that are respectful of these experts' time and that feel ap- propriately situated within the social context of the church community. Seeking expert help through computer mediated interactions may both ameliorate privacy concerns and vali- date user decisions to seek help by reminding them that their health concerns warrant support. Privacy & Close-Knit Communities While participants sought informational support from health experts and expressed an interest in connecting to church lead- ership, they more frequently selected support from peers with similar past and present experiences (9/11 boards, all boards if both partner blocks are combined). Participants from both churches describe the social structure of the church as a tight knit community composed of, in the case of Church A, many members who have belonged to the church for their entire life- time. While Church B is a younger organization, participants describe a community rich in social connections as well as sup- port. Building on existing social ties within these close-knit communities afforded the participant-designed interventions numerous advantages characteristic of peer support. Theseadvantages include: 1) established trust, 2) connections in the community and 3) regularly seeing each other. While these advantages have been identied as motivations for non- technological faith-based health interventions [6, 15], they remain benets when translated to the faith-based mHealth applications our participants conceptualized. In an mHealth setting, access to a healthcare practitioner or peer are the same in the imagined application; whereas in non-tech, community- based health research, access to a health practitioner is limited by nances, location, and time [32, 20]. Even when removing these constraints, participants still focused on building connec- tions to their peers as a critical requirement of the application. P7 described the advantages of an unofcial joint replacement support group that she joined at her church, where church members who had undergone a similar procedure would check in and share tips while at unrelated church events. P7 ex- plained, \" They were people that I knew and I trusted. And um, I saw them regularly. [...] we had a relationship that was greater than just [joint] replacement. That preceded and has continued to past [joint] replacement surgery. \" In this way, the group connected over multiple shared experiences, including a shared health journey and a shared church expe- rience. As a result of the deep connection this group shared, P7 explained that the group still exists, but now with the pur- pose of serving others in the church community. She stated, \" . . . [we] continued to refer each other to other people who are having or have, who are anticipating or who have had [joint] replacement surgery. \" While support groups based solely around a health journey may disband after the immedi- ate need is gone, this group's continued connection enables them to serve the church community more broadly through the wealth of resources and knowledge they have collectively built. Sustaining these deeply connected groups not only ben- ets the group members themselves, but also the larger church community. While P7 experienced this support group before an app was created, P4, a member of Church A, described similar ways in which his character would benet from these types of con- nections. He explained, \" So you want a team that can be able to talk about it, have a sit over coffee [laughs] and stuff. You know? Or it- this can be part of their- um, their fellow- ship. Um, I mean, after church. \" Even in the context of a technology-based intervention, P4 saw the benet of in-person meetings and the convenience of using existing fellowship practices to promote wellness. While participants felt that the app could strengthen social ties within the church community, they did not want newer or more isolated church members to feel excluded. P6 explained, \"I wouldn't want them to be excluded just because they don't have close friends [in the church]. \" Almost all participants echoed this sentiment and emphasized that continuing to retain and attract new members is an important aspect of the church's mission and should be translated to the app. The close-knit fellowship shared amongst church membership is a clear strength of the community; however, participants explain that this closeness also decreases privacy at crucial moments. While participants feel close to other church mem-bers, depending on the health concern, they are unsure of who to approach and worry that asking for that type of health networking assistance could simultaneously lead to lack of privacy. In the context of sensitive or stigmatized healthcare topics, lack of privacy was identied as a deterrent from seek- ing resources, recommendations, or support. P3 explained her hesitation discussing health concerns in church, \" maybe you go to the church, but you don't have someone speci- cally [who can help] or you're like, I'm not ready to let you specically know what I'm dealing with. \" Because of this, anonymity was most frequently discussed in the depression boards and for additional stigmatized health topics (e.g., sex- ual health). When prompted for an appropriate or desirable time to use anonymity in a health app, participants who did not complete a depression storyboard referred to mental health and sexual health. However, P4 reminds us that privacy may still be a concern, even with more mundane health issues. He explained, \" it's that some [church members]. . . and I will call them \"busybodies\". That you just don't want [them] to know . . . what you're doing until it's that time. So if you're talking about. . . your health problems. . said [the storyboard character] could've been diagnosed with one of these issues here [diabetes, high blood pressure], and just don't want to speak it out. \" P4's concern with privacy and anonymity on his wellness board demonstrate the sensitivity of any health diagnosis. Indeed, prior health interventions in churches have found privacy to be the largest barrier to accessing peer support in numerous health contexts [15, 13]. The above ndings highlight a participant identied need for opportunities to access resources in the Church that simul- taneously maintain an individual's privacy and promote safe conversations about sensitive health issues. While the churches provide some resources to their members, and Church B has many health professionals within its congregation, church members still face barriers to accessing these resources. The lack of appropriate channels for accessing resources and a need for privacy obscure the existing resources within the church. Thus, participants prioritized visibility of existing informational resources in their storyboards, and identied their own crowdsourcing initiatives to solve issues of access. Crowdsourcing Tasks To our knowledge, no prior work has explored what motivates members of a faith community to partake in crowdsourcing. During our storyboard sessions and interviews, participants discussed three main motivations to contribute to the applica- tion: 1) supporting the missions of the church 2) extending one's faith practices, and 3) strengthening connections to the church community. These motivations were illustrated in the types of crowdsourcing tasks participants endorsed and cre- ated. To understand how these motivations mapped to different crowdsourcing tasks, we grouped tasks into the public health crowdsourcing typology. Tasks within the storyboard fell into three of the four categories described in the related work: KDM, DHIT, and PVCP [4]. Central Repository of Community Resources Several participants articulated the usefulness of leveraging the application to collectively create a central repository ofresources in their community (e.g., Black-owned gyms, free clinics, local tness classes). Participants saw numerous bene- ts to this repository, including that the information would be: 1) accessible, 2) extensive and 3) culturally relevant. Access : Participants indicated that such a repository of re- sources could make relevant information accessible whenever needed. P3 discussed how the application could facilitate in- the-moment assistance: \" [if] her schedule won't allow her to physically go [to a therapist], the app has the support groups. . . the words of afrmations are things that could kind of help her cope in the meantime. \" In this scenario, the partici- pant saw value in providing an individual with immediately actionable resources while waiting on longer-term support (e.g., therapist appointments). Collective Wisdom : Two of the youngest participants discussed the benet of posting a healthcare question to the wider ap- plication community to receive a multitude of opinions and recommendations. Indeed, Brabham, et al. posits that com- munity sourced solutions in the aggregate may be of higher quality or comparable to the recommendations of an expert [3]. In addition, our oldest participant went so far as to say, that while companionship support should be personal, informa- tional support is better coming from the larger community. This participant explained, \" What makes most sense, is, accu- mulating data, uh, you know- Accumulating data for a month. Like. . . you know, Doctor A, Doctor B, I mean, who could they accumulate data on what those doctors have done, with re- spect to your malady. Now, that would be interesting. \" For this participant when talking about his health, the opinions of many outweigh that of a single individual, making the information more credible when coming from a wider source. In the group storyboard session, participants explored how larger organizations, such as this project's partner organiza- tion, could provide additional resources and support through its large network. Upon hearing another group present a sto- ryboard that included the use of the partner organization to collectively bargain for and acquire access to resources, P7 stated, \". . . I'm impressed by the fact that we didn't think about the, um, volume of contact[s] that the [partner organization] has. Because...that very much expands the access to resources that people have. \" This example demonstrates how a central repository of community resources could benet church mem- bers given that the church's afliation with a powerful resource partner is still relatively unknown to church members. As a result, resources through this organizational afliate are essen- tially inaccessible due to lack of publicity and communication within the church community. Culturally Relevant Resources : Creation of a central repository developed by peers in the community has additional benets, including that it would contain culturally relevant support. Par- ticipants explained that accessing culturally relevant resources remains a problem for both themselves and other individu- als in their community; however, as a whole, the community could provide these resources. Participants saw benet in crowdsourcing amongst church members for resources such as culturally competent physical and mental health practitioners (i.e., providers who understand that health inequality based onsocial characteristics affect how a non-White patient may be treated in various healthcare environments), or support groups as well as Black-owned tness organizations. P3 described a recent experience of her search for local tness centers, say- ing \" I just discovered a Black-owned gym. . . which I had no idea it ever existed. . . \" P3 described multiple motivations for accessing this gym, saying, \"So it's like, oh, okay, it's serving health, and you're supporting a local business and you're supporting a Black-owned business. So it's like a three for one.\" Despite living in her community for a number of years, she was unaware of a culturally relevant resource only steps from where she lives that would 'understand her needs.' Throughout interviews, participants shared their frustrations with knowing that members of their community likely have useful culturally relevant resources; however, accessing these resources remains difcult due to a lack of visibility of these resources and lack of social interaction opportunities to ask others in the context of the church. Additionally, a central repository of resources may increase a church member's op- portunity to locate culturally relevant and tailored resources and recommendations by tapping into the collective brain of the wider church community. Place-Based Calendar System : The simplest form of reinforc- ing community using a place-based mHealth application is through awareness of events by keeping a community wide calendar up-to-date. A church calendar was not a block op- tion, and yet multiple participants saw benet of a calendar in the storyboards. P3 shared with us a church events calendar, which was displayed within an application used by her pre- vious church. P3: \" you can like download stuff and you can gure out...they're having like a kids camp. And they're doing a food drive. Even out of state \", P3 uses the calendar feature in the church application to feel connected to this community through awareness of upcoming events. P3's experience in her previous church contrasts starkly with P1's description of their church's online calendar, which displays out-of-date information for ministry gatherings. She explained that an up- to-date calendar benets current church members for keeping track of church events, and also could impact a potential new church member's decision to join, \" That could, um, influence your decision on staying with that church . . . if you don't see things constantly moving, constantly changing, like would you want to keep going [to church]? \" P1 suggested that by sup- porting these church events through a simple solution, like an up-to-date church calendar, not only impacts current member's ability to participate and increase fellowship opportunities for interaction, it also promotes the growth of church membership. While a digital calendar may not pose a technical challenge or innovation, understanding how these existing technologies can be leveraged for community level health behavior change provides insight into sustainable mHealth interventions. Rating Content User Rated Health Messages : In the wellness storyboard, one optional storyline proposed a Distributed Human Intelligence Tasking approach, where the application asks the character to rate a series of short health messages as helpful or unhelpful. The user is told that highly rated messages would serve as customizable templates for their community. While partici-pants generally found message templates acceptable, some participants had concerns about the authenticity of message content constrained by templates. One participant mentioned that while she felt the activity was extremely benecial, she worried about how time consuming the activity would be. Participants agreed that rating health messages as helpful or unhelpful was appropriate, and especially useful for tailoring messages directly for their community. User Nominated Scripture : Within each storyboard, partici- pants selected types of support, including scriptural messages, to deliver to the characters during a time of need. Participants found scriptural messages impactful when working towards a health goal, and as a result, included scriptural messages on most boards (7/12 boards). Participants viewed this type of faith-based support as most authentic when provided by members of their faith community. Our research team cre- ated an optional storyline to probe participant motivation to create these faith-based messages. In the optional storyline, the character participates in a DHIT where they are asked to \"rate scripture\" as most helpful when in need of comfort or encouragement. While some participants chose this storyline as a way for the character to contribute to the application, all participants stated that using the term 'rating' scripture was inappropriate and that earlier language contained in the storyboard of \"nominating scripture\" was a more sensitive de- scription of the activity. P5 explained why scriptural messages required a more nuanced approach to crowdsourcing, \" But what's rating a scripture? Like what scripture may be good for me on this day may not be good for that person. . . that scripture may not be something that resonates with me, but on this particular day that scripture could uplift the next person. \" This discussion of the term 'rating' during the storyboard ses- sions demonstrates the strengths of the long term relationships researchers have with community members when conduct- ing CBPR. Through rapport building over the course of the project, our participants were empowered as experts of their faith community and thus felt comfortable correcting our ter- minology and generating their own description of and design for working with scriptural content in the app. Contextualizing Scripture : Participants emphasized that there is no such thing as bad scripture, and thus the initial polariza- tion of rating was a missguided oversimplication of scrip- tural content. P5 reminded us that,\" all scriptures are good and when they are received in the right moment. \" Therefore, participants suggested that a more interesting and meaning- ful activity would be to nominate scripture by relating that scripture to contextual circumstances. Participants felt that context, such as how that scripture has helped them in the past and under what health circumstances, was critical for nominating socially-relevant messages. Further by leveraging the church community in the approach, these messages could reflect a congregation's preferences for the scripture use and Bible translation. In this scenario, participants used a PVCP approach to generate faith-based support messages. Such a crowdsourcing task could facilitate the use of spiritual support in a mobile app for health behavior change. Participants from Church B already thematically tag and compile scripture in a paper-based monthly prayer calendar. Members of an inreachministry (i.e., a ministry that directly serves members of the church) at Church B manually compile a monthly prayer calen- dar, in which each month has a different theme. Members then assign a scripture to each day of the month, using the theme as the guiding principle of selection. The monthly prayer cal- endar activity in Church B, as well as participant enthusiasm of Church A, highlights how the practice of tagging scripture and thinking about its application to health experiences in one's daily life is also a form of Bible study. Nominating and tagging scripture within the application both supports an ex- isting faith practice by promoting reflection on scripture, and increases access to this activity beyond a particular ministry. Authoring Messages User Authored Health Messages : Storyboards completed by participants included the opportunity to select optional sto- rylines that contained various distributed human intelligence tasks to ascertain the motivations as well as the usefulness of the crowdsourcing technique. In the joint pain and wellness storyboards, the application prompts the storyboard character to create health messages for others in the church commu- nity. In both scenarios, participants felt that receiving health messages from peers would be benecial; however, they per- ceived the task of authoring the messages as burdensome and expressed concern about the need for curation of the content shared with the broader community. In the wellness board, participants could choose between writing health messages to the general church community or to a specic friend. Partic- ipants overwhelmingly opted to author messages to a friend, suggesting that this personal connection could motivate them to complete an otherwise tedious task. This motivation to con- nect with others complements the aforementioned frequency with which participants chose peers as sources of support within the storyboards. DISCUSSION Our ndings illuminated participant desires to connect with their peers and build stronger connections with the church com- munity through an mHealth application. They further stated preferences toward crowdsourcing tasks and conceptualized how such tools could benet their community. We conclude with a discussion of the reciprocal benets of mHealth inter- ventions when anchored in these church communities, and how crowdsourcing tasks can be leveraged to support longitudinal community engagement. Building Community Throughout the creation and discussion of the storyboards, participants prioritized how the application could serve to both extend and strengthen their existing church community. While the application was presented as primarily targeting health, par- ticipants stressed the importance of the application reinforcing existing fellowship and, as a result, building an even stronger church community. While mHealth interventions are often used to deliver social supports that are \"spatially liberated\" (i.e., not tied to a geographic location), these interventions are often plagued with low adherence [9]. Driskell et al. suggest that, while the virtual communities created by these types of interventions provide some level of social support and connec- tion, these virtual communities lack important features centralto true communities [9]. For virtual communities to grow and sustain themselves, members must feel a sense of loyalty to the community, have rich social interactions with one another, and feel that their ties to each other are close, deep, and per- sonal [9]. One strategy for creating a true community is to anchor the virtual community in a physical space and an ex- isting community. Minimal prior work has explored mHealth interventions embedded in community settings [38]. Parker et al. explored the value of embedding mHealth interventions into various community organizations, and how physical meet- ing spaces may support mHealth interventions' engagement and interest [30]. In our work with these church communi- ties, we identied opportunities for anchoring an mHealth intervention in a physical space. We further discuss the ways in which spatial anchoring could benet the church commu- nity while simultaneously supporting application adoption and engagement. Public Digital Displays : Participants from both churches en- dorsed the delivery of app content through announcements during Sunday service. These churches currently use public monitors to display announcements. By incorporating dig- ital displays within churches, the virtual community in the mHealth app is no longer \"spatially liberated\" [9] but now an- chored within the physical environment. Situating an mHealth application into a worship service may support user adoption and engagement with the app, as well as create opportunities for additional app interactions with other church members. Announcements during church serve as a nudge to users to interact with the application, and may pique the curiosity of church members not currently involved. Additionally, these announcements could be designed to prompt church member interactions and provide new topics of conversation. Prior work has explored the use of public displays to enhance the mission of organizations such as the Young Men's Chrisitan Association and \"mega churches\" [29, 44]. This work found that while these public displays were accepted, organization staff and members had divergent values and preferences for the design and use of the tools. Indeed, a future aim of this work is to engage other church stakeholders, including church leadership, to determine the attitudes and preferences towards the use of these physical spaces. Digital Calendars : Churches often lack the organizational and nancial capacity to hire administrative staff who could maintain online church resources (e.g., digital calendar) [6]. Both churches in this formative work have defunct online cal- endars. Despite no mention of calendars in the storyboards, participants envisioned how the crowdsourcing tasks they had seen in the storyboards could support church events though an updated calendar system. Using a KDM approach to populate this digital church calendar would allow church members to add church related events (e.g., Bible study, health ministry meeting, or choir practice), while circumventing the reliance on staff labor. By designing a computational artifact that pro- vides a critical function not currently supported within the church environment, we offer an alternative means of assisting the church in building organizational and structural capacity. When conducting CBPR, Campbell et al. emphasizes the im-portance of 'leaving something behind' to help the community sustain health promotion activities [6]. Evolving Content One unique affordance of church communities is long-term membership, sometimes over the course of a lifetime. Thus, the content and features of church-based mHealth applica- tions must evolve to maintain long-term interactions. HCI researchers have begun to focus on questions of temporality in health technology design. For example, Jacobs et al. examined how technology can support extended health journeys where complicated health conditions with multiple diagnostic phases require different levels of care management, coordination, and treatment [19]. Similarly, the design of a church-situated mHealth app should also focus on temporality to support sys- tem engagement and adherence. Over time, the needs and priorities of the church communities may shift and thus, health technology should support this evolution. Crowdsourcing could provide a mechanism to engage community members in dynamically collecting, sharing, and promoting socially- meaningful information to reinforce fellowship. Engaging the community members in crowdsourcing has the potential to empower traditionally socially marginalized users, such as communities of color, to enhance app content by improving its cultural sensitivity and relevancy. This is particularly critical when members of the project team may not be members of the target community. In the following section, we discuss the crowdsourcing tasks participants not only perceived as useful and engaging, but also perceived as reinforcing community- held values while simultaneously promoting health. Value-Based Crowdsourcing Participant reactions to writing and rating health messages dif- fered from their reaction to writing and nominating messages with scripture. While our work focused on exploring design requirements for an mHealth application, designing for values beyond health behavior change enhances engagement [34]. Prior research demonstrates that Black members of protes- tant faith communities feel a strong afliation between their faith and health [6, 32]. Promoting scripture for health topics and concerns was proposed as a low-burden crowdsourcing activity to create tailored mHealth intervention content that reflects values important to church members: spirituality and faith. However, unlike rating health messages as helpful or unhelpful, nominating the most helpful scripture was rejected by participants. A crowdsourced DHIT activity was perceived as trivializing scriptural content. In contrast, participants ex- pressed enthusiasm for contextualizing the scripture to create more meaningful health communication messages. This activ- ity both increased community access to faith-based support, and served as an opportunity for the individual to practice their faith through reflection on scripture. In reaction to our nominating scripture activity, participants reimagined the activity and proposed a solution using the PVCP approach. As dened by Brabham et al., the PCVP approach is used for 'ideation problems that are a matter of taste or market preferences.' We expand the denition of the PVCP approach to include the cultural preferences of a spiritual community. Scriptural content related to health is amatter of authoring personally relevant content, not merely rat- ing information (DHIT). Participants proposed other methods of creatively crowdsourcing the activity, including authoring content on the contextual relevance of scripture (e.g., \"this scripture puts life into perspective\"). Providing this context was critical to producing useful scriptural support for a variety of health concerns. While participants expressed little interest in authoring health messages, they expressed enthusiasm for the same task when applied to scripture-based messages. Par- ticipants involved with this work either attended Bible study regularly, studied the Bible daily, or expressed a desire to expand their knowledge of the Bible. Reading and reflect- ing on scripture and content related to their faith is highly valued. When applied to scripture, this PVCP activity not only mirrored the participants' current faith practices, but also supported techno-spiritual practices that they hoped to incor- porate into their daily lives. Designing crowdsourcing tasks that reflect multiple values of this population (e.g., faith and wellness) can simultaneously nurture application engagement and strengthen spiritual practice. Limitations This work was conducted with two denominational faith com- munities in collaboration with a community-based partner organization. Further work is needed to explore how these ndings translate to different denominations and different faith communities. Furthermore, our work focuses on church mem- bers; however input from additional church stakeholders is critical in the development and adoption of these ndings. CONCLUSION Through our participatory design study, we investigated mo- tivations and preferences for engaging with an mHealth app among church members of predominantly Black churches. Our ndings shed light on how social structures in these churches impact access to social supports and health resources, and how crowdsourcing tasks can be leveraged to increase this access. We further discussed the acceptability and benet of anchoring an mHealth intervention in the physical space of the church, and the importance of aligning crowdsourcing tasks with participant values of fellowship and faith. We pro- pose crowdsourcing approaches that may support long-term engagement in a community-based mHealth app by generating culturally-tailored content. The needs, priorities, and strengths of social organizations shift. Therefore, future HCI work in mHealth intervention delivery should focus on how implement- ing crowdsourcing approaches may positively compliment this evolution.
