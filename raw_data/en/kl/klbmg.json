It can cause dehydration, infections in the intestines, and even something as drastic as kidney failure if it is not treated properly. A gut cleanse is necessary to remove that waste from the body and relieve the painful symptoms associated. As Dr. Junger, founder of Clean Program expertly explains, [\"Our chemicalized diet with too much processed foods, vegetable oils and trans fats, non-organic foods, caffeine and alcohol radically changes our internal ecosystem.\"](https://www.hungryforchange.tv/article/detox)Junger goes on to explainthe reasoning behind why our bodies hold onto this waste, \" [Our bodies try to protect us from dangerous substances by setting it aside, surrounding it with mucus and fat so that it will not cause an imbalance...](https://www.hungryforchange.tv/article/detox)\" Cleansing is the optimal way of aiding our bodies in the natural cleansing system that it already undergoes, making it easier to pass this waste and clearing the digestive pathway for our bodies to naturally cleanse effectively again.

Eliminate Waste If you are experiencing a blockage, it is vital that you do not rely on laxatives. The repeated use of laxatives can [increase constipation, by making it more difficult for your colon to naturally contract](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/constipation/in-depth/laxatives/art-20045906#:~:text=Laxative%20use%20can%20be%20dangerous,contract%20and%20actually%20worsen%20constipation.). A natural colon cleanse is a much safer option to rid your body of this waste. Clean Program can help with this, specifically with Clean 7 and Clean 21 cleanse programs. It is also important to drink plenty of water to help naturally flush everything out. Check out [Clean 7](https://www.cleanprogram.com/collections/all-products/products/clean7) and [Clean 21](https://www.cleanprogram.com/collections/all-products/products/clean21) cleanse programs! Clean 7 [Clean 7](https://www.cleanprogram.com/products/clean7?variant=32047760965765) is a 7 day cleanse that blends practices in Ayurveda, functional medicine, and intermittent fasting. This plan treats the root of any health issues within the body and promotes whole-body wellness. The Clean 7 kit includes the following plant-based products: The Daily Shake protein powder (in chocolate, vanilla, or plain), daily supplement packets, Tulsi tea, as well as a digital cleanse guide. This cleanse focuses on holistic healing and is packed with nutrients that assist the body in letting go of toxins and promoting balance. Clean 21 [Clean 21](https://www.cleanprogram.com/products/clean21) is a 21 day cleanse plan that works to restore the body's natural healing ability as well. It includes the same nutritional goodness as the Clean 7 kit, with a larger supply of course. Each element of the cleanse works together to flush out any health-inhibiting toxins, promote gut health, and restore the body to a more harmonious state. The foods one is consuming can be a major factor in creating a painful blockage, so a healthy diet change, during and after a cleansing period, will help to prevent these from happening in the future and improve overall gut health as a result. Clean Program cleanses focus on a healthy lifestyle switch, not weight loss or toxic restriction. It's all about providing the blueprint to live a healthy lifestyle and support the body every day, from the inside out!

Develop a Poop Routine Routines are a key principle in Ayurveda, as they work to create balance and harmony within the body. Even something like a poop routine can positively contribute to this. One of the most important steps in said routine is to leave your phone outside of the bathroom when it is time to go. It is so easy for the device to distract from the main purpose of being in the bathroom, expelling waste from the body. Friends don't let friends scroll and poop! Finding a comfortable space and making it the designated place to do this activity is essential. This will tell the body that each time this space is entered, it is time to poop. Having a scent associated with this routine, such as consistently using a lavender air freshener spray after the routine is complete, is also training the body to establish a healthy routine around elimination. [The Olfactory Cortex is the part of the brain associated with the sense of smell](https://www.discovery.com/science/Why-Smells-Trigger-Such-Vivid-Memories), which often connects a certain scent to a place or memory. This is what the brain does with routines, such as a poop routine associated with a certain scent of air freshener or a particular bathroom in the home. Gut Health & Routines A key Ayurvedic principle is that one's health reflects one's daily habits and routines and maintaining balance and harmony within the body is at its core. Ayurveda is all about promoting healthy living and inner balance. It is complementary to western medicine practices and cleansing is a key component. Cleansing is a core practice utilized to eliminate any imbalances within the body, such as a colon blockage that is creating discomfort, inhibiting gut health, and causing bloating. Digest To assist with bloating and gas on a regular basis, it is helpful to take supplements such as [enzyme capsules](https://www.cleanprogram.com/products/digest). The ingredients within these capsules work to break down fats, protein, and cellulose. Taking these daily could result in optimal gut health and reduced constipation. It is usually best to take these with food, such as during breakfast so the enzymes can work throughout the day. Transform your gut health with [Digest enzyme capsules](https://www.cleanprogram.com/products/digest)! Move If one's diet is lacking fiber, incorporating fiber powder into a daily smoothie or protein shake is a fantastic idea. In addition to improving gut health, this fiber supplement also promotes immunity. Adding this prebiotic to one's daily routine allows the body to absorb more calcium and magnesium, which improves bowel function tremendously. Incorporate more fiber into your diet with [Move fiber powder](https://www.cleanprogram.com/products/move?variant=19132644687990)!
