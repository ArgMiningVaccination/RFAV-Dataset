The WHO has now reported over 112,000 cases of measles around the world during the first few months of 2019. It has nearly multiplied by 4 compared to the same time last year. New outbreaks are being discovered in other countries, including the US, which has resulted in illness and in some cases, death. Most of these cases that have adverse events are in young children, some so young that have yet to be vaccinated from the measles. In the United States, the CDC has confirmed 555 measles cases across 20 US states. 90 cases were reported during the week of April 11. The disease is spreading and increases, which is causing much concern among health care professionals. The MMR vaccine is given to children in 2 doses. The first dose is given at 12 months, while the second dose is given at 4-6 years old. As you can see, young children, under the age of 1, are not vaccinated. Therefore, they are at a high risk of getting the diseases that the vaccine is for. Vaccines can help prevent these diseases so easily, and their benefits outweigh their adverse effects, as multiple studies have shown. There is no drug out there that can be given without a risk. Vaccines are no different. We encourage all our patients at SWC to be informed, make educated decisions and feel free to ask us questions.
