With that said, it's the perfect time to tell you about my daily herbal healing shot that I can confidently say gives me the boost I need to show up as the best version of myself. I think we can all agree, if we learned anything from this year, it's the importance of good health and healing! Now that you've spent the last few weeks pampering all your loved ones with gifts and festive celebrations, it's time to do something for YOU! As women, mamas, business owners, wives, friends, sisters, daughters - we always give so much! For me, it's so easy to feel depleted if I don't set aside time for ME and have rituals in place that nourish and heal my body from the inside out. If you've been following me for awhile you might remember me mentioning my discovery of [Mountain Meadow Herbs](https://www.mmherbs.com) earlier this year. I became a loyal customer of their herbal elixirs when I was pregnant with the twins. I was looking for natural, pure, and effective products with the highest quality ingredients. I was so pleased when I was introduced to this brand since it was exactly what I was searching for. Fast forward to almost one year later, these products are still a part of my morning ritual, so much so, I have named my own combination of products: The Model Mama Daily Boost. This combination is what I take every morning (now that I'm no longer breastfeeding or pregnant) alongside drinking 8oz of water. Without further ado, this is my daily shot recipe, a combination of herbal elixirs that boost immunity, weight loss, improve the quality of my sleep, and make me feel less stressed. The Model Mama Daily Boost: 2 droppers - Hormone Balance 2 droppers - Adrenal Aid 2 droppers - Herbal Calcium 6 droppers - Weight Control 2 droppers - Family Immune Booster Hormone Balance \u2014 Perfect for moms or really anyone. Did you know hormones can be affected by food, birth control and so much more? This plays into so much more than your mood. Adrenal Aid \u2014 Helps support postpartum exhaustion with energy boosting functions. Think of your adrenal gland as your \"anxiety button.\" When it's happy, your skin will glow, your hair will shine, and you'll feel less nervous. Herbal Calcium - Calcium is one of the most important minerals for the human body. Your teeth, bones, central nervous system, muscles and brain function all depend on it for optimal function. It also helps support calm and healthy sleep habits. Weight Control \u2014 Adding this one to my coffee every morning to get things moving. If you've been following along on my bounce-back body journey, you know I've been determined to target some stubborn areas and give my endorphins a pick-me-up. Family Immune Booster \u2014 Made from Elderberry and Echinacea, two of nature's most powerful immune boosters! Added bonus, this elixir is also alcohol-free and completely safe for people of all ages, including infants, little kids (Henry takes this too), nursing and/or expecting moms. Another thing I love about [this brand](https://www.mmherbs.com) is that it's totally safe and just as effective to mix their remedies together. For efficiency's sake (and because i'm BUSY) I just put them all together in a shot glass and throw it back. I must admit throwing back a shot glass takes me back to the 20-something years when I didn't have a baby on my hip - LOL! But in all seriousness, doing this ensures I get my full dose and don't forget to drink it throughout the day. #mombrain Double bonus - their products actually taste yummy so it's the sweetest shot of mama's super power serum in one dose. Multitasking made easy, oh hey mamas, hey! Use code: TARA20 to stock up. With this remedy, I'm ready to take on a new year. 2 0 2 1 here "}
