Also at our office we have found that the combination of chiropractic with massage therapy has helped improve many problems much faster than with chiropractic alone. Also at our office the Doctors are really good at getting the patient involved in their care. We try to take the approach that we are a team and try tackle the problem in that way. We have found that the more active the patient is in their care that they will get the results that they desire. Another thing that separates our office is that we are more of a lifestyle care practice than a crisis practice. What this means is that once we get patients out of pain we want them to stay that way and be able to live their lives without limits. We will teach them if they are willing ways to keep them out of pain and to even improve their lives no matter their ages. We also have those crisis patients that just want to be treated for their condition and let them go after that. The good thing about our office is that it is totally going to be up to you on which road you choose.
