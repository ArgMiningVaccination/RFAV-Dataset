It is a very powerful tool that helps us to stay calm in the face of the inevitable challenges of life. It teaches us to act and not to react. A life without meditation is like a horse without reins; an automobile without a steering wheel, or a ship without a compass. Emotions consume us and can leave us completely drained and exhausted. A degree of emotional maturity is necessary to develop an adequate reserve of mental energy for creative solutions to the problems of life. The practice of meditation brings stability in emotions. Brings Spiritual Illumination The spiritual illumination alone can silence doubts, liberate the soul, and endow us with unshakable faith in our spiritual destiny. Spiritual illumination gives a new orientation to life and it has its manifestation on the mental level in the form of: - poise - peace - naturalness - serenity - stability of emotions - conservation of energy - and a capacity to bear the frustrations of life Meditation Relieves anxiety One of the reasons for anxiety is racing thoughts or overthinking. Meditation helps calm the thoughts of an overactive mind. Anxious people are very restless and find it difficult to sit and meditate, but with a patient teacher and regular practice, they can learn the skill to calm themselves. Many scientific studies have found meditation to be an effective remedy to treat anxiety. Relieves Stress The modern lifestyle, day to day challenges triggers a stress response, which takes a toll on the health and happiness of an individual, leading to many diseases. A portion of the brain releases a hormone called the cortisol, which is responsible for stress. Meditation primarily helps in reducing its release and calming your nerves. One emerges refreshed and rejuvenated from a meditation session. These stress-relieving qualities also stall and help in slowing down the aging process. Channelizes the flow of energy into constructive channels Meditation liberates the mind/body from the bondage of opposites and enables the physical and psychic energies to flow into creative, constructive channels. Most mental disorders arrive from extreme ego-centrism and self-preoccupation which results in inhibition, anxiety, and paralysis of the will. The freeing of an individual with such selfishness is one of the major benefits of meditation, on the physical level. Brings complete behavioral transformation. A new world view induces a new quality of consciousness which leads to a change in interpersonal relationships. According to Bhagawad Gita, a meditation on God alone can give us lasting peace and happiness. The observed results of meditation are, - an un-agitated voice - relaxed neck muscles - a kind appearance - a tension-free gait - grace and charm in all actions Increases the capacity of the mind and improves memory Meditation endows a person with increased capacity of mind by releasing its dormant power, it connects with the peace and serenity of the soul. The mind is rejuvenated, strengthened, and regains its lost vigour, increasing its capacity to bear the frustrations of life. The mind being clear from conflicts, is more efficient, effective, and creative; enabling a person to stay calm amid any eventuality. Brings good health Last but not the least, meditation manifests a positive impact on physical health. It brings good health, a gentle voice and increased neuro-muscular energy. It stops wastage of all vital energy. The first few benefits of meditation are lightness, health, absence of desire, good complexion, beautiful voice, an agreeable odour of the body, and slight excretions.
