How to Use A Healing Crystal The first thing to do when you're working with a crystal is to set an intention. The crystal works for you, but you have to tell it what to do. It will then serve as a daily reminder of that goal. Hold the crystal in your hands, close your eyes, and take deep breaths. Then ask that the highest vibration of love and light connect with your highest self in order to receive the blessings from this crystal.\" End by saying thank you to affirm that what you're asking for already exists in the universe.
