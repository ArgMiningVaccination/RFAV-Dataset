Originally found - ed in 1834 as the Medical College of Louisiana, tasked to improve the public health of the New Orleans region, Tulane University has emerged today as a national and world leader in public service and social engagement. Our university is also recognized as a leader in scholarship, research and art-making. We are celebrated for being innovative, trend-setting, and student-centered. Our schools and our undergraduate college offer an impressively wide array of degrees in architecture, business, law, liberal arts, medicine, public health and tropical medicine, science and engineering and social work. Indeed, the university has demonstrated a profound commitment to a superior learning environment by fostering outstanding scholarship, research, and artistic accomplishment among its faculty. Tulane professors have been awarded the most prestigious honors in the academic world along with being elected to membership in the National Academies and in the American Academy for Arts and Sciences. Over the past four decades, Tulane colleagues have received 28 Fulbright Fellowships, 12 National Science Foundation CAREER Awards, 8 Guggenheim Foundation Fellowships, 9 National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowships, 3 Alfred P. Sloan Fellowships and 2 Nobel Prizes in Medicine. Tulane now resolutely connects its values and mission to the needs of the city of New Orleans, the state of Louisiana and the Gulf Coast region. As a consequence, the profile and impact of the research, scholarship and artistic endeavors in which our faculty and students engage are being transformed. More and more Tulane faculty and staff members focus their expertise on the pursuit of a wide array of public service efforts (citywide, regionwide, nationwide, and worldwide). At the same time, our students gain practical experience, putting their rapidly maturing skills to use. We are very proud that our students thus have a truly unique educational experience. And we know that our outstanding teaching and mentorship, and the striking diversity in the degree programs we offer, help attract to Tulane the very best faculty and students from across our nation and from around the world. In the final analysis, it is the faculty and staff who make Tulane the truly extraordinary place that it is. It is their excellence and skill that inspires our students and that will always enlighten, sustain, strengthen and improve the wider communities we serve.
