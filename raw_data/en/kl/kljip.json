General consensus from literature and external guidelines Hospitalization o Moderate or severe CAP ( IDSA strong recommendation; moderate - to high (more frequent in severe CA P, variable in moderate) - pulse oximetric SpO 2 <90-93% in room air ( strong recommendation; some consensus on values ) o Infants less than 3 to 6 months of age ( strong recommendation; varying evidence on age and addition of suspected bacterial CAP ) o Suspected complicated CAP o Children who cannot be adequately cared for at home, unable to comply with therapy, unable to follow up Admission to ICU or continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring ( strong recommendation; moderate - to high -quality evidence ) o Invasive ventilation via nonpermanent artificial airway o Impending respiratory failure o Sustained tachycardia o Remains hypoxic on FiO 2 (generally >50%; some consensus on value ) o Hypotension o Requires pharmacologic support of blood pressure or perfusion o Requires use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (CPAP or BiPAP) Mentioned occasionally Comorbidities presdiposing patient to more severe pneumonia (cardiopulmonary disease, malignancy, prematurity, chronic lung disease, immunocompromised) Inadequate oral intake or inability to tolerate PO (infant) Effusion Altered mental status ( IDSA strong recommendation; low -quality evidence ) Fever OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 5 Failure of outpatient therapy Sepsis Severity of illness score indicating severe CAP ( strong recommendation; low -quality evidenc e) Suspected or documented caused by community -associated MRSA ( ISDA refill time >2 min Limitations for consideration No validated reference standard or scoring system for severity of CAP or need f or hospitalization The ability of the family to comply with medical prescriptions is not always easy to establish No consensus on cutoff level of hypoxemia requiring hospitalization No consensus on age below which hospitalization should be required - and some caveat age limit, suggesting admit only for infants with suspected bacterial CAP External Guidelines In 2018, the Canadian Paediatric Society recommended the following: Most children with pneumonia can be managed as outpatients. Specific paediatric criteria for admission are not available. Hospitalization is generally indicated if a child has inadequate oral intake, is intolerant of oral therapy, has severe illness or re spiratory compromise (eg, grunting, nasal flaring, apnea, hypoxemia), or if the pneumonia is complicated. There should be a lower threshold for admitting infants younger than six months of age to hospital because they may need more supportive care and moni toring, and it can be difficult to recognize subtle deterioration clinically. In 2018, New South Wales recommended the following: The decision to hospitalize a child with pneumonia must be an individual one based on age and clinical factors. Hospitalization should be considered for all infents less than 3 months of age and for a child of any age whose family cannot provide appropriate care and assure compiance with the therapeutic plan. Additional indications for hospitalization include: o Hypoxaemia (oxygen saturation consistently less than 95% in room air) o Dehydration, or inability to maintain hydration orally; inability to feed in an infant o Moderate to severe respiratory distress: o Respiratory rate greater than 55 breaths/minute in infants l ess than 12 months, or respiratory rate greater than 50 breaths/minute in older children o Difficulty breathing, apnoea, or grunting o Signs of toxicity (drowsy, lethargic or irritable, pale, mottled and/or tachycardic) o Underlying conditions that may predispos e to a more serious course of pneumonia such as cardiopulmonary disease, chronic lung disease, prematurity, history of malignancy OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 6 o Presence of complications (e.g. effusion/empyema) o Failure of outpatient therapy (worsening or no response in 24 to 72 hours) In 2017, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended the following: Decisions on whether to hospitalize a patient are made by weighing the following criteria: o Hypoxemia (oxygen saturations <90% to 92% at sea level) o Infants <3 to 6 months of age with s uspected bacterial community -acquired pneumonia o Tachypnea: Infants <12 months of age: respiratory rate >70 breaths per min Children: respiratory rate >50 breaths per min o Respiratory distress: apnea, grunting, difficulty breathing, and poor feeding o Signs of dehydration or inability to maintain hydration or oral intake o Capillary refill time >2 s o Infants and children with toxic appearance Suspected or confirmed to have infection with a virulent organism (community - acquired methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus or group A Streptococcus) o Underlying conditions/comorbidities that: May predispose patients to a more serious course (eg, cardiopulmonary disease, genetic syndromes, neurocognitive disorders, neuromuscular disorders) May be worsened by pneumonia (eg , metabolic disorder) May adversely affect response to treatment (eg, immunocompromised host, sickle cell disease) o Complications (eg, effusion and/or empyema) o Failure of outpatient therapy (48 -72 h with no clinical response) o Caretaker unable to provide app ropriate observation or to comply with prescribed home therapy Indications for intensive care unit admission include: o Severe respiratory distress or impending respiratory failure that requires: Intubation and mechanical ventilation Positive pressure ventil ation o Recurrent apnea or slow irregular respirations o Cardiopulmonary monitoring due to cardiovascular compromise secondary to: Sustained tachycardia Inadequate blood pressure Requirement of pharmacological support for blood pressure or perfusion Altered mental status due to hypercarbia or hypoxemia Pulse oximetry measurement of <92% on fractional inspired oxygen concentration of >0.50 o Pediatric Early Warning Score >6 In 2012, the American Academy of Family Physicians recommended: Infants OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 7 o Apnea or grunting o Oxygen saturation 92% o Poor feeding o Respiratory rate > 70 breaths per minute Older children o Grunting o Inability to tolerate oral intake o Oxygen saturation 92% o Respiratory rate > 50 breaths per minute All age groups o Comorbidities (e.g., chronic lung disease, asthma, unrepaired or incompletely repaired congential heart disease, diabetes mellitus, neuromuscular disease) o Family is not able to provide appropriate observation In 2011, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases S ociety of American (IDSA) recommended the following: Children and infants who have moderate to severe CAP, as defined by several factors, including respiratory distress and hypoxemia (sustained saturation of peripheral oxygen, 90% at sea level) should be h ospitalized for management, including skilled pediatric nursing care. (strong recommendation; high -quality evidence) o Signs of respiratory distress: Tachypnea, respiratory rate, breaths/min Age 0 -2 months: status Pulse oximetry measurement <90% on room air Infants less than 3 -6 months of age with suspected bacterial CAP are likely to benefit from hospitalization. (strong recommendation; low -quality evidence) Children and infants with suspected or documented CAP caused by a pathogen with increased virulence, such as community -associated methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA -MRSA) should be hospitalized. (strong recommendation; low -quality evidence) Children and infants for whom there is concern about careful observation at home or who are unable to c omply with therapy or unable to be followed up should be hospitalized. (strong recommendation; low -quality evidence) OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 8 A child should be admitted to an ICU if the child requires invasive ventilation via a nonpermanent artificial airway (eg, endotracheal tube ). (strong recommendation; high -quality evidence) A child should be admitted to an ICU or a unit with continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring capabilities if the child acutely requires use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (eg, continuous positi ve airway pressure or bilevel positive airway pressure). (strong recommendation; very lowquality evidence) A child should be admitted to an ICU or a unit with continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring capabilities if the child has impending respiratory failu re. (strong recommendation; moderate - quality evidence) A child should be admitted to an ICU or a unit with continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring capabilities if the child has sustained tachycardia, inadequate blood pressure, or need for pharmacologic sup port of blood pressure or perfusion. (strong recommendation; moderate - quality evidence) A child should be admitted to an ICU if the pulse oximetry measurement is <92% on inspired oxygen of >/=0.50. (strong recommendation; low -quality evidence) A child shou ld be admitted to an ICU or a unit with continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring capabilities if the child has altered mental status, whether due to hypercarbia or hypoxemia as a result of pneumonia. (strong recommendation; low -quality evidence) Severity of illness scores should not be used as the sole criteria for ICU admission but should be used in the context of other clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings. (strong recommendation; low -quality evidence) o Major criteria for CAP severity of illness: Invasive mechanical ventilation Fluid refractory shock Acute need for NIPPV Hypoxemia requiring FiO 2 greater than inspired concentration or flow feasible in general care area o Minor criteria for CAP severity of illness Respiratory rate higher than WHO classif ication for age Apnea Increased work of breathing (e.g., Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 9 Primary Literature: Source, Year Summary of findings Comments Quality or risk of bias Florin, 2018 PIDS -IDSA criteria in predicting need NFH: non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, effusion, altered mental status, fluid refractory shock, multilobar infiltrates, low 2:FiO 2 ratio, hypotension, metabolic acidosis, respiratory rate >WHO criteria, pediatric early warning score >6 Strongest predictors of severe CAP: hypoxemia, altered mental status, pediatric early warning score >6, increased work of breathing, hypotension, respiratory rate >WHO criteria PIDS -IDSA criteria fair to good ability to discriminate severity of CAP, but not need for hospitalization Many criteria lack reliability and interpretation of criteria is variable Low to unclear risk of bias a Note: Retrospective cohort (N=518) in one peds ED a QUADAS -2 tool for diagnostic accuracy studies *No systematic reviews, RCTs, or prospective cohorts available, therefore retrospective cohort presented.

OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 10 Question 2: What diagnostic laboratory and imaging tests should be used in a child with suspected CAP in a clinic or hospital ward setting? General consensus from literature and external guidelines A moving target, largely reliant on clinical judgment, plus imaging and laboratory tests for those admitted to hospital No true gold standard as a diagnostic reference o CXR exposes children to radiation, normal reading does not exclude pneumonia, limited relevance to clinical outcomes; ultrasound easier and less costly, but interpretation is dependent on expertise of reader, cannot image entire lung at once, and consolidatio n can be missed (if deep) or misinterpreted (spleen, air in the stomach) o Lab tests may be contaminated by other organisms not responsible for pneumonia, cultures may have low yield and therefore high cost per case, sensitivity / specificity may be limited Patients managed in outpatient setting o Most laboratory and imaging tests are not routinely indicated in outpatient management ( strong recommendation; high -quality evidence ) o Blood cultures may be considered upon failure of outpatient therapy ( some consensu s) Patients admitted for hospitalization o Pulse oximetry Should be performed in all children with CAP and suspected hypoxemia ( strong recommendation; high -quality evidence ) o Imaging Ultrasonography is preferred first line imaging ( strong recommendation; moderate -quality evidence ) Easier, can be done in sleeping children, but interpretation dependent on expertise of reader Chest radiographs (CXR; postero -anterior and lateral) may be obtained in hospitalized patients to document presence, size, and charact er of infiltrates and verify absence or presence of complications ( some consensus ) Follow -up CXR not routinely indicated, unless progressive symptoms or clinical deterioration 48 -72 hours after initiation of therapy ( strong recommendation; moderate -quality evidence ) o Blood cultures Not routinely indicated Consider with children admitted with CAP that have pleural effusion or require ICU admission Repeat cultures not routinely indicated, unless bacteremia caused by S. aureus o Microbiological and virological t ests Should test for influenza virus in all children with CAP ( strong recommendation ) In children with signs and symptoms suspicious for M. pneumoniae , consider testing to help guide antibiotic selection o Acute phase reactants OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 11 In children with moderate to s evere CAP, serum procalcitonin, ESR, and CRP may be used to inform clinical management along with other laboratory and imaging studies o CBC Not routinely indicated, but may consider for children with severe CAP along with other laboratory and imaging studi es o Sputum Gram stain and cultures May be obtained for children who can provide sufficient sputum o Urinary antigen detection tests Not indicated ( strong recommendation ) Patients who are critically ill o Chest CT with contrast for necrotizing pneumonia and lung abscesses o Tracheal aspirates for Gram stain and culture and viral pathogens in intubated children o Bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage, or biopsy only if other diagnostic tests are negative Limitations for consideration A universally accepted, practic al reference standard for diagnosis of pneumonia does not exist The future of CXR is uncertain; ultrasound is preferred, but utility for informing antibiotic treatment is less well -studied Pathogen detection is limited by potential contamination of other colonizing pathogens or multiple infection sources, limited sensitivity and/or specificity, and difficulty in differentiating bacterial vs. viral pneumonia External Guidelines In 2018, the Canadian Paediatric Society recommended the following: Optimally, the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia should be supported by a chest radiograph before starting antimicrobials. When bacterial pneumonia is suspected clinically (a febrile child with acute respiratory symptoms and physical findings compatible with consolidation or pleural effusion), a chest radiograph (both postero -anterior and lateral) should usually be obtained. o Radiographs are not indicated for children experiencing wheezing with a typical presentation of bronchiolitis or asthma because bacterial pneumonia is very unlikely. However, in cases where the diagnosis of bacterial pneumoniais highly suspected from history, combined with typical clinical and physical findings and the child is not sufficiently ill to requirehospitalization, a chest radiogr aph is not essential. o Ultrasound at the point of care appears to be sensitive and specific for detecting pneumonic infiltrates but requires further validation. Most cases are not bacteremic at the time of diagnosis. If sputum is available (usually only in children >10 years of age), it should be sent for Gram staining and, if considered adequate, cultured. OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 12 Viral testing of nasopharyngeal secretions is usually not indicated for outpatients with suspected pneumonia. However, such testing should be strongly c onsidered in children admitted during influenza season with possible viral pneumonia because antivirals are likely to be of benefit for influenza pneumonia, particularly in moderately to severely ill children. o Nasopharyngeal specimens should be sent for mo lecular diagnostics if testing is available and the child is hospitalized, bearing in mind that the length of carriage is unknown; a positive result may indicate remote infection. A complete blood count with differential testing and blood cultures (before starting antimicrobial therapy, if possible) are indicated for children who are hospitalized. Even though the yield from blood cultures is low, a positive result is helpful, especially if the child subsequently experiences a complicated course. o As adequate volumes of blood are more likely to yield a pathogen, the minimum volume of blood cultured should be at least 1 mL to 2 mL in infants, 4 mL to 5 mL in children <10 years of age and 10 mL to 20 mL in older children. In 2018, New South Wales recommended the following: The diagnosis of pneumonia requires historical or physical examination evidence of an acute infectious process with signs or symptoms of respiratory distress or radiologic evidence of an acute pulmonary infiltrate, and depends to some extent up ong the setting (inpatient or outpatient), the severity of the illness, and the age of the patient. o In general, aetiologic diagnosis should be sought in children who require admission to hospital and those who fail to respond to initial treatment. In appropriate clinical setting the diagnosis can be made without radiographs. Chest x -ray changes may lag behind clinical findings and ultrasound. o Children that are well enough to be discharged from the ED with clear clinical signs of pneumonia do not need a chest x -ray to confirm the diagnosis. In children with mild CAP, a chest x -ray should not be considered a routine test. It is recommended that a chest x -ray be obtained when: o Pneumonia is classified as moderate to severe o Clinical findings are unclear o Exclusion of alternate explanation for respiratory distress (foreign body, heart failure) o A complication such as pleural effusion is suspected o The pneumonia is prolonged or unresponsive to antimicrobials o In a rural setting where access to after -hours diagnos tics is limited, or decisions regarding escalation of care need to be made early. In children with severe CAP, the diagnosis should be confirmed by chest x -ray and a full investigative process undertaken. Most children that require hospital admission will have moderate to severe disease and will require a chest x -ray. o The recommended chest x -ray view depends upon the age of the child. In children older than 4 years the front posterior upright chest view is usually obtained to minimize the cardiac shadow. In younger children the position does not affect the cardiothoracic shadow, and the anterior -posterior supine view is preferred. OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 13 Lateral chest x -ray should not be routinely performed. Ultrasound is simple, radiation -free, more sensitive than chest x -ray for detection of CAP in children, and is as good as chest x -ray in identifying pleuropulmonary alterations in children with suspected pneumonia. o Indicated as first line investigation to confirm and quantify pleural fluid and empyema if suspected clinically or radiologically Continuous pulse oximetry should be performed in every child that presents with CAP. Laboratory evaluation of the child with CAP depends on the clinical scenario, age, severity of illness, presence of potential complications, underlying co morbidities, and requirement for admission. o As a general rule children who are managed as outpatients do not require any investigations unless significant comorbidities. o Young infants (i.e. less than 3 months) in whom pneumonia is suspected, particularly those who are febrile and have signs of toxicity, will require further investigation to exclude other causes of infection. o Complete blood count: In children with mild CAP, not necessary unless significant comorbidities. In children with moderate CAP, it m ay be considered as it may provide useful information in conjunction with the clinical presentation to allow a decision to be made regarding requirement for admission to hospital. In children admitted with severe CAP, should be undertaken. o Acute phase reactants: ESR, CRP, and serum procalcitonin should only be considered in moderate to severe disease, and may be used in conjunction with clinical findings to assess response to therapy. o Full blood count: Look for neutrophilia, leucopaenia, and lympthocyto sis o Urea and electrolytes: In moderate to severe disease only, urural and electrolyte testing may be helpful in assessing the degree of dehydration and whether hyponatraemia is present o Microbiological investigations: For children admitted to hospital with CAP it is important to attempt a microbiological diagnosis o Blood culture: Should be obtained if the child requires admission to hospital, in children with moderate to severe CAP Repeat cultures of S. aureus should be performed every 24 hours until they ar e 'no growth' to document efficacy of therapy; this should occur regardless of clinical status and antimicrobial therapy should continue for the full duration o Sputum Gram stain and culture: reasonable sensitivity and specificity for presumptive detection o f S. pneumonia o Nasopharyngeal bacterial culture: uninformative and should not be routinely undertaken o Nasopharyngeal aspirates: Should be considered for viral detection using PCR and/or immunofluorescence on all children less than 18 months admitted with C AP. o Pleural fluid: if required expertise is available, may be used for diagnostic purposes when there is evidence of effusion present o Urine: should not be undertaken, as specificity is too poor OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 14 o Serum: If patient is admitted with severe pneumonia or clinica l presentation is supportive of an infection with Mycoplasma or Chlamydia Serology remains the mainstay for diagnosing M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae In 2017, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended the following: Focal opacity on chest radiograph s is often held as a standard of reference; however, some viral processes and atelectasis can cause focal radiographic findings (though atelectasis traditionally resolves in 48 -72 hours), and findings on radiographs can lag behind clinical symptoms. No standard of reference for diagnosis or single definition of pneumonia exists. o Unfortunately, no constellation of clinical symptoms or signs (fever, tachypnea, hypoxemia, work of breathing) displays good specificity or sensitivity for radiographic findings ofp neumonia, except that symptom severity and ill appearance do correlate with focal infiltrates. Chest radiographs are indicated in patients with more severe respiratory distress, particularly those who meet criteria for hospitalization. o Other indications f or chest radiography include inconclusive clinical findings and ruling out other possible causes of respiratory distress that can be diagnosed at radiography (foreign body, pneumothorax, pleural disease, or cardiac disease, including pulmonary edema and ca rdiomegaly). o Imaging is also indicated in febrile infants without a source who are younger than 12 months of age, if there is evidence of leukocytosis. Conversely, in patients with mild evidence of lower respiratory tract infection (fever, cough) without hypoxemia or a focal lung examination who are stable for outpatient treatment, radiographs of the chest are not typically indicated. In addition, it is not recommended to pursue tests to assess for a cause if the patient does not meet criteria for inpatie nt treatment. Laboratory examinations are considered for all patients ill enough to be hospitalized with suspected bacterial pneumonia. The number and types of examinations performed depends on the severity and trajectory of the illness. These may commonly include blood cultures, inflammatory markers, complete blood cell count, and nasopharyngeal swab PCR for viruses. o Blood cultures rarely yield positive findings in CAP, and they should not be performed in patients treated on an outpatient basis or in hosp italized patients with uncomplicated disease. When pleural fluid is obtained, it should be sent for Gram stain and bacterial culture, as well as cell count and differential, to allow differentiation of bacteria from othercauses of effusion (ie, mycobacteri al, oncologic). o Inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C -reactive protein level, or procalcitonin) may aid in clinical decision -making if measured longitudinally, particularly in those with complicated CAP. o The complete blood cell count may provide information on further complications, such as thrombocytopenia or anemia from hemolytic uremic syndrome. o Nasopharyngeal swabs for viral PCR should only be performed if the results will change management. OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 15 o Coordination with a respiratory therapist t o use specialized techniques to improve sputum expectoration and/or nasal aspiration may be required in children younger than 6 years of age to obtain a successful, high -quality specimen (fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells per low -power field). While sputum collection is not necessary for evaluation in a patient treated on an outpatient basis, attempts should be made to obtain sputum in children with moderate to severe pneumonia who are hospitalized. In 2017 the American Academy of Pediatrics Section o n Emergency Medicine Committee on Quality Transformation recommended the following: In the ED setting, for children with mild CAP: o CBC, inflammatory markers, blood cultures not routinely indicated o Imaging not routinely indicated; consider CXRin those with diagnostic uncertainty or concern for complications In the ED setting, for children with moderate CAP: o CBC, inflammatory markers not routinely indicated o Blood culture not routinely indicated unless complicated pneumonia or underimmunized child o Obtain AP an d lateral chest x -ray; consider bedside ultrasound as adjunct diagnostic tool if ultrasound credentialed provider is present In the ED setting, for children with severe CAP: o Obtain CBC/differential o Consider inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP), lactacte, VBG, a nd BMP o Obtain blood and sputum culture (if able to expectorate) o Obtain AP and lateral chest x -ray; consider bedside ultrasound as adjunct diagnostic tool if ultrasound credentialed provider is present In 2016, the American College of Emergency Physicians recommended the following: In well -appearing immunocompetent infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years presenting with fever (38\u00b0C [100.4\u00b0F]) and no obvious source of infection, physicians should consider obtaining a chest radiograph for those with cough, hypoxia, rales, high fever (39\u00b0C), fever duration greater than 48 hours, or tachycardia and tachypnea out of proportion to fever. ( Level B recommendation ) In well -appearing immunocompetent infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years presenting with fever (38\u00b0C [100.4\u00b0F]) and wheezing or a high likelihood of bronchiolitis, physicians should not order a chest radiograph. ( Level C recommendation ) In 2011, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of American (IDSA ) recommended the following: Microbiologic Testing Blood Cultures: Outpatient Blood cultures should not be routinely performed in nontoxic, fully immunized children with CAP managed in the outpatient setting. (strong recommendation; moderate -quality eviden ce) OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 16 Blood cultures should be obtained in children who fail to demonstrate clinical improvement and in those who have progressive symptoms or clinical deterioration after initiation of antibiotic therapy. (strong recommendation; moderate -quality evidence) Blood Cultures: Inpatient Blood cultures should be obtained in children requiring hospitalization for presumed bacterial CAP that is moderate to severe, particularly those with complicated pneumonia. (strong recommendation; low -quality evidence) In improving patients who otherwise meet criteria for discharge, a positive blood culture with identification or susceptibility results pending should not routinely preclude discharge of that patient with appropriate oral or intravenous antimicrobial thera py. The patient can be discharged if close follow -up is assured. (weak recommendation; low -quality evidence) Follow -up Blood Cultures Repeated blood cultures in children with clear clinical improvement are not necessary to document resolution of pneumococc al bacteremia. (weak recommendation; low -quality evidence) Repeated blood cultures to document resolution of bacteremia should be obtained in children with bacteremia caused by S. aureus, regardless of clinical status. (strong recommendation; low-quality e vidence) Sputum Gram Stain and Culture Sputum samples for culture and Gram stain should beobtained in hospitalized children who can produce sputum. (weak recommendation; low -quality evidence) Urinary Antigen Detection Tests Urinary antigen detection tests are not recommended for the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia in children; false -positive tests are common. (strong recommendation; high -quality evidence) Testing For Viral Pathogens Sensitive and specific tests for the rapid diagnosis of influenza virus and other respiratory viruses should be used in the evaluation of children with CAP. A positive influenza test may decrease both the need for additional diagnostic studies and antibiotic use, while guiding appropriate use of antiviral agents in both outpa tient and inpatient settings. (strong recommendation; high -quality evidence) Antibacterial therapy is not necessary for children, either outpatients or inpatients, with a positive test for influenza virus in the absence of clinical, laboratory, or radiogra phic findings that suggest bacterial coinfection. (strong recommendation; high -quality evidence) Testing for respiratory viruses other than influenza virus can modify clinical decision making in children with suspected pneumonia, because antibacterial ther apy will not routinely be required for these children in the absence of clinical, laboratory, or radiographic findings that suggest bacterial coinfection. (weak recommendation; low -quality evidence) OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 17 Testing for Atypical Bacteria Children with signs and sym ptoms suspicious for Mycoplasma pneumoniae should be tested to help guide antibiotic selection. (weak recommendation; moderate -quality evidence) Diagnostic testing for Chlamydophila pneumoniae is not recommended as reliable and readily available diagnostic tests do not currently exist. (strong recommendation; high -quality evidence) Ancillary Diagnostic Testing Complete Blood Cell Count Routine measurement of the complete blood cell count isnot necessary in all children with suspected CAP managed in the outp atient setting, but in those with more serious disease it may provide useful information for clinical management in the context of the clinical examination and other laboratory and imaging studies. (weak recommendation; low -quality evidence) A complete blo od cell count should be obtained for patients with severe pneumonia, to be interpreted in the context of the clinical examination and other laboratory and imaging studies. (weak recommendation; low -quality evidence) Acute -Phase Reactants protein (CRP) concentration, or serum procalcitonin concentration, cannot be used as the sole determinant to distinguish between viral and bacterial causes of CAP. (strong recommendation; high -quality evidence) Acute -phase reactants need not be routinely measured in fully immunized children with CAP who are managed as outpatients, although for more serious disease, acute -phase reactants may provide useful information for cli nical management. (strong recommendation; low -quality evidence) In patients with more serious disease, such as those requiring hospitalization or those with pneumonia -associated complications, acute -phase reactants may be used in conjunction with clinical findings to assess response to therapy. (weak recommendation; low -quality evidence) Pulse Oximetry Pulse oximetry should be performed in all children with pneumonia and suspected hypoxemia. The presence of hypoxemia should guide decisions regarding site of care and further diagnostic testing. (strong recommendation; moderate -quality evidence) Chest Radiography Initial Chest Radiographs: Outpatient Routine chest radiographs are not necessary for the confirmation of suspected CAP in patients well enough to be treated in the outpatient setting (after evaluation in the office, clinic, or emergency department setting). (strong recommendation; high -qualit y evidence) OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 18 Chest radiographs, posteroanterior and lateral, should be obtained in patients with suspected or documented hypoxemia or significant respiratory distress and in those with failed initial antibiotic therapy to verify the presence or absence of c omplications of pneumonia, including parapneumonic effusions, necrotizing pneumonia, and pneumothorax. (strong recommendation; moderate -quality o Signs of respiratory distress: Tachypnea, respiratory rate, breaths/min Age 0 -2 months: status Pulse oximetry measurement <90% on room air Initial Chest Radiographs: Inpatient Chest radiog raphs (posteroanterior and lateral) should be obtained in all patients hospitalized for management of CAP to document the presence, size, and character of parenchymal infiltrates and identify complications of pneumonia that may lead to interventions beyond antimicrobial agents and supportive medical therapy. (strong recommendation; moderate - quality evidence) Follow -up Chest Radiograph Repeated chest radiographs are not routinely required in children who recover uneventfully from an episode of CAP. (strong r ecommendation; moderate -quality evidence) Repeated chest radiographs should be obtained in children who fail to demonstrate clinical improvement and in those who have progressive symptoms or clinical deterioration within 48 - 72 hours after initiation of ant ibiotic therapy. (strong recommendation; moderate -quality evidence) Routine daily chest radiography is not recommended in children with pneumonia complicated by parapneumonic effusion after chest tube placement or after videoassisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), if they remain clinically stable.

(strong recommendation; low -quality evidence) Repeated chest radiographs 4 -6 weeks after the diagnosis of CAP should be obtained in patients with recurrent pneumonia involving the same lobe a nd in patients with lobar collapse at initial chest radiography with suspicion of an anatomic anomaly, chest mass, or foreign body aspiration. (strong recommendation; moderate -quality evidence) OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 19 What Additional Diagnostic Tests Should Be Used in a Child with Severe or Life -Threatening CAP? The clinician should obtain tracheal aspirates for Gram stain and culture, as well as clinically and epidemiologically guided testing for viral pathogens, including influenza virus, at the time of initial endotracheal t ube placement in children requiring mechanical ventilation. (strong recommendation; lowquality evidence) Bronchoscopic or blind protected specimen brush sampling, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), percutaneous lung aspiration, or open lung biopsy should be reserved for the immunocompetent child with severe CAP if initial diagnostic tests are not positive.

General consensus from literature and external guidelines Outpatient o Mild Amoxicillin as a first -line therapy for preschool children an d school -aged children and adolescents with mild to moderate CAP for infants suspected to be of bacterial origin (Strong Recommendation; Moderate Quality Evidence) Macrolide antibiotics should be prescribed for treatment of children (primarily school -aged children and adolescents) with mild to moderate CAP caused by atypical pathogens (Conditional Recommendation; Moderate Quality Evidence - IDSA Guideline) If suspicion of atypical pneumonia (mycoplasma), for age > 5yr add azithromycin (AAP Guideline) Influenza antiviral therapy should be administered as soon as possible to children with moderate to severe CAP consistent with influenza virus infection.

(Canadian Guidelines) If influenza is detected or suspected, strong consideration should be given to prompt treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir). If penicillin parenteral penicillin allergy: oral levofloxacin (16 -20 mg/kg/day divided q 12 hr (age 6 mos - 5 yrs) or 8 -10 mg/kg/day (age 5 -16 yrs) once daily (max daily dose 750 mg); clindamycin (40 mg/kg/day divided q 8 hr - max dose 600 mg), or linezolid In underimmunized children: cephalosporin (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) Children who experience respiratory failure or septic shock associated with pneumonia should receive empiric therapy with a third generation cephalosporin because it offers broader coverage. Additional recommendations for inpatient treatment: o Analgesia can be given to relieve discomfort from fever or pain related to the Pneumonia o Oxygen should be provided to patients to keep their saturations equal to or above 95% o When oxygen therapy required, consider warm, humidified oxygen (if available) o Patients exclusively on intravenous fluids require daily monitoring of their electrolytes to monitor for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) 20 o Chest physiotherapy has not been shown to be beneficial and is not recommended 20 o In any progressively unwell child, consideration should be given to transfer the patient to a higher care facility. o For patients with signs/symptoms or blood gas concerning for impending respiratory failure, provide respiratory support as needed; supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen satur ations >90% o Maintain circulatory status/manage shock if present Limitations for consideration Populations ages varied in guidelines and primary literature, may consider different treatment options for different age groups Limited data for macrolides OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 32 External Guidelines In 2011, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of American (IDSA) recommended the following: Outpatients Antimicrobial therapy is not routinely required for preschool -aged children with CAP, because viral pathogens are responsible for the great majority of clinical disease. (strong recommendation; high -quality evidence) Amoxicillin should be used as first -line therapy for previously healthy, appropriately immunized infants and preschool children with mild to moderate CAP suspected to be of bacterial origin. Amoxicillin provides appropriate coverage for Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most prominent invasive bact erial pathogen. Table 5 lists preferred agents and alternative agents for children allergic to amoxicillin. (strong recommendation; moderate -quality evidence) Amoxicillin should be used as first -line therapy for previously healthy appropriately immunized school -aged children and adolescents with mild to moderate CAP for S. pneumoniae, the most prominent invasive bacterial pathogen. Atypical bacterial pathogens (eg, M. pneumoniae), and less common lower respiratory tract bacterial pathogens, as discussed in the Evidence Summary, should also be considered in management decisions. (strong recommendation; moderate - quality evidence) Macrolide antibiotics should be prescribed for treatment of children (primarily school -aged children and adolescents) evaluated in a n outpatient setting with findings compatible with CAP caused by atypical pathogens. Laboratory testing for M. pneumoniae should be performed if available in a clinically relevant time frame. Table 5 lists preferred and alternative agents for atypical path ogens. (weak recommendation; moderate -quality evidence) Influenza antiviral therapy (Table 6) should be administered as soon as possible to children with moderate to severe CAP consistent with influenza virus infection during widespread local circulation o f influenza viruses, particularly for those with clinically worsening disease documented at the time of an outpatient visit. Because early antiviral treatment has been shown to provide maximal benefit, treatment should not be delayed until confirmation of positive influenza test results. Negative results of influenza diagnostic tests, especially rapid antigen tests, do not conclusively exclude influenza disease. Treatment after 48 hours of symptomatic infection may still provide clinical benefit to those wi th more severe disease. (strong recommendation; moderate -quality evidence) Inpatients Ampicillin or penicillin G should be administered to the fully immunized infant or school -aged child admitted to a hospital ward with CAP when local epidemiologic data document lack of substantial high -level penicillin resistance for invasive S. pneumoniae . Other antimicrobial agents for empiric therapy are provided in Table 7. (strong recommendation; moderate -quality evidence) Empiric therapy with a third -generation parenteral cephalosporin (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) should be prescribed for hospitalized infants and children who are not fully immunized, in OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 33 regions where local epidemiology of invasive pneumococcal strains documents high -level penicillin resistance, or for infants and children with life -threatening infection, including those with empyema (Ta ble 7). Non -b-lactam agents, such as vancomycin, have not been shown to be more effective than third -generation cephalosporins in the treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia for the degree of resistance noted currently in North America. (weak recommendation; m oderate -quality evidence) Empiric combination therapy with a macrolide (oral or parenteral), in addition to a b -lactam antibiotic, should be prescribed for the hospitalized child for whom M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae are significant considerations; diag nostic testing should be performed if available in a clinically relevant time frame (Table 7). (weak recommendation; moderate -quality evidence) Vancomycin or clindamycin (based on local susceptibility data) should be provided in addition to b-lactam therap y if clinical, laboratory, or imaging characteristics are consistent with infection caused by S. aureus (Table 7). (strong recommendation; low -quality evidence) How Can Resistance to Antimicrobials Be Minimized? Antibiotic exposure selects for antibiotic resistance; therefore, limiting exposure to any antibiotic, whenever possible, is preferred. (strong recommendation; moderate -quality evidence) Limiting the spectrum of activity of antimicrobials to that specifically required to treat the identified pathog en is preferred. (strong recommendation; low -quality evidence) Using the proper dosage of antimicrobial to be able to achieve a minimal effective concentration at the site of infection is important to decrease the development of resistance. (strong recomme ndation; low -quality evidence) Treatment for the shortest effective duration will minimize exposure of both pathogens and normal microbiota to antimicrobials and minimize the selection for resistance. (strong recommendation; low -quality evidence) In 2018, the Canadian Paediatric Society recommended the following : If influenza is detected or suspected, strong consideration should be given to prompt treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir). When other viruses are detected in a nasophar yngeal sample and/or the chest radiograph is most compatible with viral pneumonia (ie, without consolidations), manage with supportive care (ie, oxygen and rehydration if required) without antibiotics, unless there is convincing evidence of a secondary bac terial pneumonia. Outpatients with lobar or broncho -pneumonia should usually be treated with oral amoxicillin. Patients who require hospitalization but do not have a life -threatening illness should usually be started empirically on intravenous ampicillin. There is recent data demonstrating that ampicillin alone leads to a good clinical outcome in almost all cases of community -acquired pneumonia, including cases that require hospitalization. Children who experience respiratory failure or septic shock associa ted with pneumonia should receive empiric therapy with a third generation cephalosporin because it offers broader coverage. Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime offer better coverage than amoxicillin or ampicillin for OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 34 beta -lactamase -producing H influenzae and may be more efficacious against high -level penicillin -resistant pneumococcus - and possibly provide empirical coverage for the rare methicillin -susceptible S aureus (a rare cause of pneumonia). However, when there is rapidly progressing multilobar disease or pneu matoceles, the addition of vancomycin is suggested empirically to provide extra coverage for MRSA until culture results are available. If results of microbiological investigations in these patients do not reveal a pathogen, transitioning to ampicillin with subsequent oral amoxicillin is reasonable. In 2018, New South Wales recommended the following: Outpatient management Analgesia can be given to relieve discomfort from fever or pain related to the pneumonia Follow -up should be arranged to evaluate the patient for any deterioration. Inpatient management Analgesia can be given to relieve discomfort from fever or pain related to the Pneumonia Oxygen should be provided to patients to keep their saturations equal to or above 95% When oxygen therapy required, consider warm, humidified oxygen (if available) Patients exclusively on intravenous fluids require daily monitoring of their electrolytes to monitor for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) 20 Chest physiotherapy has not been shown to be beneficial and is not recommended 20 In any progressively unwell child, consideration should be given to transfer the patient to a higher care facility. In 2017 the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Emergency Medicine Committee on Quality Transformation recommended the following: Mild Initiate oral antibiotic therapy: Amoxicillin 90 mg/kg/day divided TID (max dose 3 g/day), see footnote for children with penicillin allergy and/or underimmunized children Alternate dosing regimen of 90 mg/kg/ day divided BID may be acceptable if lower rates of pneumococcal resistance (consider local resistance patterns and MICs) Duration of therapy: 7 -10 days If suspicion of atypical pneumonia (mycoplasma), for age > 5yr add azithromycin Influenza treatment if clinical or laboratory diagnosis per current CDC recommendations Moderate Initiate parenteral antibiotic therapy: Ampicillin 150 -200 mg/kg/day divided q 6 hrs - max dose 4 g/day; see footnote for children with penicillin allergy and/or underimmunized child ren If suspicion of atypical pneumonia (mycoplasma), for age > 5yr add azithromycin Influenza treatment if clinical or laboratory diagnosis per current CDC recommendations Severe OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 35 Initiate parenteral antibiotic therapy: o Ceftriaxone: 100 mg/kg/day divided q 12-24 hrs OR o Cefotaxime: 150 mg/kg/day divided q 8 o Vancomycin: 40 -60 mg/kg/day divided q 6 -8 hrs OR o Clindamycin: 40 mg/kg/d divided q 6 -8 hrs If sus picion of atypical pneumonia (mycoplasma), for age > 5yr add azithromycin For patients with signs/symptoms or blood gas concerning for impending respiratory failure, provide respiratory support as needed; supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations >90% Maintain circulatory status/manage shock if present Influenza treatment if clinical or laboratory diagnosis per current CDC recommendations Footnotes: If penicillin allergy, administer cephalosporin (oral cefpodoxime, cefuroxime, or parenteral penicillin allergy: oral levofloxacin (16 -20 mg/kg/day divided q 12 hr (age 6 mos - 5 yrs) or 8 -10 mg/kg/day (age 5 -16 yrs) once daily (max daily dose 750 mg); clindamycin (40 mg/kg/day divided q 8 hr - max dos e 600 mg), or linezolid In underimmunized children: Azithromycin: IV --10 mg/kg (max dose 500 mg) day 1 and 2, then transition to oral; Oral --10 mg/kg (max dose 500 mg) once on day 1, then 5 mg/kg (max dose 250 mg) once daily on days 2 - 5 OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 36 In 2012, the American Academy of Family Phys icians recommended: Mathur, 201 8 included a comparison of international guidance for antibiotic therapy Primary literature Source, Year Study (N) Summary of findings Quality Lodha, 201 3 Systematic Review (N=3,952) Non -severe CAP: Amoxicillin compared with cotrimoxazole had similar failure rates (odds ratio (OR) 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) Low to unclear risk of bias OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 37 0.91 to 1.51) and cure rates (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.89). In children presenting with CAP without underlying illness, and where poi nt of care tests for identification of etiological agents for pneumonia are not available, empirical antibiotics may be used as follows. For the treatment of WHO -defined non -severe community -acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children below five years of age a moxicillin is an alternative to co - trimoxazole. There are no apparent differences between azithromycin and erythromycin, azithromycin and coamoxyclavulanic acid, or cefpodoxime and co - amoxyclavulanic acid. There are limited data on other antibiotics: co - amoxyclavulanic acid and cefpodoxime may be alternative second -line drugs. Lodha, 201 3 Systematic Review (N=4,331) Severe pneumonia without hypoxemia : oral antibiotics (amoxicillin/co - trimoxazole) compared with injectable peni cillin had similar failure rates (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.24), hospitalization rates (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.34) and relapse rates (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.34 to 4.82). Low to unclear risk of bias OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 38 In children presenting with CAP without underlying illness, and where point of care t ests for identification of etiological agents for pneumonia are not available, empirical antibiotics may be used as follows. Severe pneumonia in children below five years of age, without hypoxia and accepting oral feeds, can be managed with oral amoxici llin on an ambulatory basis. Lodha, 2016 Systematic Review (4 RCTs, N=4,400) Failure rate in children receiving oral antibiotics was 13% (288/2208) while that in children receiving parenteral antibiotics was 13.8% (302/2183) OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.78, 1.11 Low to unclear risk of bias Biondi, 2014 Systematic Review (17 trials) Spectrum vs. nonspectrum treatment of M. pneumoniae in children suggested pooled risk difference of 0.12 (95% CI, -.04 to 0.20) C. pneumoniae and M. pneum oniae responded equally to treatment. Data suggests that 12% of children treated with a macrolide will have more rapid clinical improvement, corresponding to a number needed to treat of 8.33, but the confidence interval overlapping 0% negates statistical s ignificance. High risk of bias OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 39 Lodha, 2018 Systematic Review (N=1,116) Severe CAP: Death rates were higher in children receiving chloramphenicol compared to those receiving penicillin/ampicillin plus gentamicin (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.07). In children presenting with CAP without underlying illness, and where point of care tests for identification of etiological agents for pneumonia are not available, empirical antibiotics may be used as follows. For children below five years of age, hospit alized with severe and very severe CAP, penicillin/ampicillin plus gentamycin is superior to chloramphenicol. Other alternatives may be co - amoxyclavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin and cefuroxime. Low to unclear risk of bias Dinur -Schejter, 2012 Retrospective chart review (N=319) Treatment failure was not significantly different (7.6% vs. 4.7%) Number of days of IV treatment, days of oxygen requirement, and days of hospitalization were similar (2.36 +/ - 1.6 days vs. 2.59 +/ - 1.6 days, 0.31 +/ - 1.2 days vs. 0.64 +/- 1.3 days, and 2.67 +/ - 1.4 days vs. 2.96 +/ - 1.7 days, respectively).

Consensus from guidelines Main two factors: clinical and imaging (see next page for specifics) Size (strong, moderate) Respiratory compromise (strong, moderate) May require drainage: Large and/or growing in size Impairing pulmonary function Organized and loculated Preventing adequate response to antibiotics Surgical intervention is indicated when sepsis and infected fluid are not effectively controlled with antibiotics alone and/or in the presence of significant respiratory compromise. Free -flowing fluid: chest tube + fibrinolytics (tPA, qd for 3 days) within 24 hours or VATS within 48 hours after initiation of antibiotic therapy Empyema: VATS within 48 hours Small effusion (opacity less than \u00bc of thorax, <10 mm rim of fluid on lateral) o Tx with antibiotics, do not drain or obtain fluid for culture o If no response to antibiotics, reassess size: if still small, continue antibiotics and do not drain; if moderate or large, follow large effusion algorithm Moderate effusion (opacity greater than \u00bc but less than \u00bd of thorax, >10 mm rim of fluid): o Consult with surgical or IR o if mild degree of respiratory compromise, tx with antibiotics and consider thoracentesis, can perform chest ultrasound or CT in conjunction with drainage.

OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 54 Question 8. What laboratory testing should be performed on pleural fluid? External Guidelines: In 2011, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of American (IDSA) recommended the following: Gram stain and bacterial culture of pleural fluid should be performed whenever a pleural fluid specimen is obtained. (Strong Recommendation; High Quality Evidence) Antigen testing or nuclei acid amplification through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) increase the detection of pathogens in pleural fluid and may be useful for management. (Strong Recommendation; Moderate Quality Evid ence) Analysis of pleural fluid parameters such as pH and levels of glucose, protein, and lactate dehydrogenase, rarely change patient management and are not recommended. (Weak Recommenation; Very Low Quality Evidence) Analysis of the pleural fluid white b lood cell (WBC) count, with cell differential analysis, is recommended primarily to help differentitate bacterial from mycobacterial etiologies and from malignancy. (Weak Recommendation; Moderate Quality Evidence) The 2018 Canadian Paediatic Society stated the following: Ultrasound at the point of care appears to be sensitive and specific for detecting pneumonic infiltrates but requires further validation. Ultrasound and computed tomography are also useful in the diagnosis of complicated pneumonia. Both wil l detect parapneumonic effusions, which often accompany uncomplicated pneumonia, as well as empyemas, where persistent fever is a predominant symptom. In 2018, New South Wales recommended the following: If the required expertise is available, pleural flui d may be aspirated for diagnostic purposes when there is evidence of an effusion present. However, in children it would be rare to perform this procedure due to its traumatic nature. Ultrasound guided thoracocentesis is the accepted clinical standard in ch ildren as it reduces the risk for iatrogenic pneumothorax. A specimen should be sent for biology and virology. Culture positive rates are in the order of 17 -20%. In 2017, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended the following: Moderate effusion size : Effusion opacity greater than \u00bc but less than \u00bd of thorax o Chest US or CT may be performed in conjunction with IR drainage or if needed, surgical localization Large effusion size: Effusion opacity greater than \u00bd of thorax o Symptoms less than 10 days - Obta in pleural fluid for culture and drain the pleural space of fluid Options for drainage: Chest tube alone: If no change within 12 hours, add fibrinolytics OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 55 Chest tube with fibrinolytics: If not responding within 24 hours, than process to VATS Chest US or CT may be performed in conjunction with IR drainage or if needed, surgical localization In 2017 the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Emergency Medicine Committee on Quality Transformation recommended the following: Use CXR to demonstrate moderate to large pleural effusions > 10 mm System Guidelines: Children's Hospital , 2017 Evaluation and Management of Pleural Effusion o Concern for effusion on XR that may require drainage Effusions that may require drainage are those that the clinican is conerned are: Large and/or growing in size Impairing pulmonary function Organized and loculated Preventing adequate response to antibiotics o Obtain US of Chest; General Surgery Free flowing fluid Chest tube within 24 hours or VATs within 48 hours Empyema OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 56 VATS within 48 hours Children's Hopsital of Colorado , 2016 - Followed AAP algorithm Children's Hopsital of Seattle , 2018 History and physical examination may be suggestive of parapneumonic effusion in children suspected of having CAP, but chest radiography should be used to confirm the presence of pleural fluid.

Only 11 our of 60 CAP patients had received no prior antibiotic dose when PF was analyzed. Of the 60 patients with CAP, a microbial etiology was established in 41 (68.3%); of these, the microorganism was detected in the PF in 40 and in blood culture only in the remaining patient. By culture only, blood and/or PF, a bacterial pathogen was detected in 21.7% of CAP patients, 15.7% by blood culture and 10% by PF culture. In conclusion, despite prior antimicrobrial therapy in 49 (81.7%) CAP patients, an etiological diagnosis could be established in 41 (68.3%), 35 being (58.3%) Streptococcus pneumonia .

OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 61 Question 9. What are the drainage options for parapneumonic effusions? In 2011, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of American (IDSA) recommended the following: Small, uncomplicated parapneumonic effusions should not routinely be drained and can be treated with antibiotic therapy alone. (Strong Recommendation; Moderate Quality Evidence) Moderate parapneumonic effusions associated with respiratory distress, large parapneumonic effusions, or documented purulent effusions should be drained. (Strong Recommendation; Moderate Quality Evidence) Both che st thoracostomy tube drainage was the addition of fibrinolytic agents and VATS have been demonstrated to be effective methods of treatment. The choice of drainage procedure depends on local expertise. Both of these methods are associated with decreased mor bidity compared with chest tube drainage alone. However, in patients with moderate -to-large effusions that are free flowing (no loculations), placement of a chest tube without fibrinolytic agents is a reasonable first option. (Strong Recommendation; High Q uality Evidence) The 2018 Canadian Paediatic Society stated the following: Culture and drainage of a pleural effusion is indicated if the effusion is large and/or is clinically important as a cause for respiratory compromise or when response to medical the rapy alone is not satisfactory. In 2017, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended the following: Large effusion size: Effusion opacity greater than \u00bd of thorax o Symptoms less than 10 days - Obtain pleural fluid for culture and drain the pleural spac e of fluid Options for drainage: Chest tube alone: If no change within 12 hours, add fibrinolytics Chest tube with fibrinolytics: If not responding within 24 hours, than process to VATS Chest US or CT may be performed in conjunction with IR drainage or if needed, surgical localization OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 62 Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) , 2017 Evaluation and Management of Pleural Effusion o Concern for effusion on XR that may require drainage Effusions that may require drainage are thse that the clinican is conered are: Large and/or growing in size Impairing pulmonary function Organized and loculated Preventing adequate response to antibiotics o Obtain US of Chest; General Surgery Free flowing fluid Chest tube within 24 hours or VATs within 48 hours Empyema VATS within 48 hours OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 63 Children's Hospital of Colorado , 2016 - Followed AAP algorithm OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 64 Question 10. When should VATS or open surgical decortication be considered in patients who have ha d chest tube drainage with or without fibrinolytic therapy? In 2011, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of American (IDSA) recommended the following: VATS should be performed when there is persistence of moderate -large effusions and ongoing respiratory compromise despite ~2 -3 days of management with a chest tube and completion of fibrinolytic therapy. Open chest debridement with decortication represents another option for management of these children but is associ ated with higher morbidity rates. (Strong Recommendation; Low Quality Evidence) In 2018, New South Wales recommended the following: For patients with pleural empyema, Video -assisted thoracoscopic surgery or small bore drainage with instillation of fibrinolytics (e.g. 6 doses of urokinase over 3 days) is often required. In 2017, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended the following: Large effusion size: Effusion opacity greater than \u00bd of thorax o Symptoms greater than 10 days Consider primary VATS OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 65 Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), 2017 Evaluation and Management of Pleural Effusion o Concern for effusion on XR that may require drainage Effusions that may require drainage are thse that the clinican is con ered are: Large and/or growing in size Impairing pulmonary function Organized and loculated Preventing adequate response to antibiotics o Obtain US of Chest; General Surgery Free flowing fluid Chest tube within 24 hours or VATs within 48 hours Empyema VATS within 48 hours Children's Hopsital of Colorado , 2016 - Followed AAP algorithm OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 66 Question 11: What is the indication for fibrinolytic therapy for a parapneumonic effusion?

National Guidelines Recommendations: IDSA, 2011 Patients are eligible for discharge when they have documented overall clinical improvement, including level of activity, appetite, and decreased fever for at least 12 -24 hours. (Strong recommendation; very low quality evidence) Patients are eligible for discharge when they demonstrate consistent pulse oximetry measurements, >90% in room air for at least 12 -24 hours (Strong recommendation; moderate quality evidence) Patients are eligible for discharge only if the y demonstrate stable and/or baseline mental status (strong recommendation; very low quality evidence) Patients are not eligible for discharge if they have substantially increased work of breathing or sustained tachypnea or tachycardia (strong recommendatio n; high quality evidence) Patients should have documentation that they can tolerate their home anti -infective regimen, whether oral or intravenous, and home oxygen regiment, if applicable, before hospital discharge (strong recommendation; low quality evide nce) For infants or young children requiring outpatient oral antibiotic therapy, clinicians should demonstrate that parents are able to administer and children are able to adequately comply with taking those antibiotics before discharge (weak recommendatio n, very low quality evidence) For children who have had a chest tube and meet the requirements listed above, hospital discharge is appropriate after the chest tube has been removed for 12 -24 hours, with either no clinical evidence of deterioration since removal, or if a chest radiography was obtained for clinical concerns, radiographic evidence of no significant reaccumulation of parapneumonic effusion or pneumothorax. (strong recommendation; very low quality evidence) In infants and children with barrie rs to care, including concern about careful observation at home, inability to comply with therapy, or inability to be followed -up, these issues should be identified and addressed before discharge (weak recommendation; very low quality evidence) New South W ales, 2018 Patients are eligible for discharge when there is overall clinical improvement, good oral intake, resolution of symptoms with consistent pulse oximetry measurements equal to or greater than 95% for at least 12 hours.

External Guideline Recommendations: IDSA, 2013 Children should be immunized with vaccines for bacterial pathogens, including S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and pertussis to prevent CAP. (strong recommendation; high - quality evidence) All infants >6 months of age and all children and adolescents should be imm unized annually with vaccines for influenza virus to prevent CAP. (strong recommendation; high quality evidence). Parents and caretakers of infants <6 months of age, including pregnant adolescents, should be immunized with vaccines for influenza virus and pe rtussis to protect the infants from exposure. (strong recommendation; weak -quality evidence) Pneumococcal CAP after influenza virus infection is decreased by immunization against influenza virus. (strong recommendation; weak -quality evidence) High -risk infa nts should be provided immune prophylaxis with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) - specic monoclonal antibody to decrease the risk of severe pneumonia and hospitalization caused by RSV. (strong recommendation; high -quality evidence) AAFP, 2012 Routine child hood immunization with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine significantly reduces the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in children (Evidence Rating: A) New South Wales, 2018 A major factor in the prevention of CAP is the general improvement in pub lic health. Ensuring adequate nutrition, preventing low birth weight and improved hand washing have had good effects in the developed world. However much still needs to be done to improve housing standards, crowding and smoking inside the house especially in the Indigenous community. In addition to this, the uptake of routine vaccinations needs ongoing emphasis by all health professionals Intermountain Healthcare, 2013 Screen all patients for influenza, pneumococcal, Hib and/or pertussis immunizations at th e clinic or before hospital discharge.

GRADE criteria for rating a body of evidence on an intervention Developed by the GRADE Working Group Grades and interpretations: High: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderate: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Low: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Very low: Any estimate of effect is very uncertain. Type of evidence and starting level Randomized trial -high Observational study -low Any other evidence -very low Criteria for increasing or decreasing level Reductions Study quality has serious ( -1) or very serious ( -2) problems Important inconsistency in evidence ( -1) Directness is somewhat ( -1) or ser -2) uncertain Sparse or data ( -1) Reporting bias highly probable ( -1) Increases Evidence of association strong (+1) or very strong (+2) Strong association defined as significant relative risk (factor of 2) based on consistent evide nce from two or more studies with no plausible confounders Very strong association defined as significant relative risk (factor of 5) based on direct evidence with no threats to validity. OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 83 Appendix B. Trustworthy Guideline rating scale The University of Pennsylvania's Center for Evidence -Based Practice Trustworthy Guideline rating scale is based on the Institute of Medicine's \"Standards for Developing Trustworthy Clinical Practice Guidelines\" (IOM), as well as a review of the AGREE Enter prise and Guidelines International Network domains. The purpose of this scale is to focus on the weaknesses of a guideline that may reduce the trust a clinical user can have in the guideline, and distinguish weaknesses in documentation (e.g. guide -line d oes not have a documented updating process) from weaknesses in the guidance itself (e.g. recommendations are outdated). Current quality scales like AGREE emphasize documentation. They are important checklists for developers of new guidelines, but are less useful for grading existing guidelines. These scales also are harder for clinicians and other persons who are not methodology experts to apply, and their length discourages their use outside formal technology assessment reports. This new scale is brief, ba lanced, and easy and consistent to apply. We do not attempt to convert the results of this assessment into a numeric score. Instead we present a table listing the guidelines and how they are rated on each standard. This facilitates qualitative understand ing by the reader, who can see for what areas the guideline base as a whole is weak or strong as well as which guidelines are weaker or stronger. 1. Transparency A Guideline development methods are fully disclosed. B Guideline development methods ar e partially disclosed. C Guideline development methods are not disclosed. The grader must refer to any cited methods supplements or other supporting material when evaluating the guideline. Methods should include: Who wrote the initial draft How the committee voted on or otherwise approved recommendations Evidence review, external review and methods used for updating are not addressed in this standard. 2. Conflict of interest A Funding of the guideline project is disclosed, disclosures are made for each individual panelist, and financial or other conflicts do not apply to key authors of the guideline or to more than 1 in 10 panel members). B Guideline states that there were no conflicts (or fewer than 1 in 10 panel members), but does not disclose funding source. C Lead author, senior author, or guideline panel members (at least 1 in 10) have conflict of interest, or guideline project was funded by industry sponsor with no assurance of independence. NR Guideline does not report on potent ial conflict of interests. For purposes of this checklist, conflicts of interest include employment by, consulting for, or holding stock in companies doing business in fields affected by the guideline, as well as related financial conflicts. This definition should not be considered exclusive. As much as anything, this is a surrogate marker for thorough reporting, since it may be assumed that OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 84 guideline projects are funded by the sponsoring organization and many authors think it unnecessary to report a non -conflict. 3. Guideline deve lopment group A Guideline development group includes 1) methodological experts and clinicians and 2) representatives of multiple specialties. B Guideline development group includes one of the above, but not both. C Guideline developers all from one specialty or organization, and no methodologists. NR Affiliations of guideline developers not reported The purpose of this standard is to ensure that supporters of competing procedures, or clinicians with no vested interest in utilization of one procedur e or another, are involved in development of the guideline. Both AGREE II and IOM call for patient or public involvement: very few guideline panels have done so to date, so this is not necessary for guidelines to be rated A. Involvement of methodologists o r HTA specialists in the systematic review is sufficient involvement in the guideline development group for our purposes. In the absence of any description of the guideline group, assume the named authors are the guideline group. 4. Systematic review A Guideline includes a systematic review of the evidence or links to a current review. B Guideline is based on a review which may or may not meet systematic review criteria. C Guideline is not based on a review of the evidence. In order to qualify as a systematic review, the review must do all of the following: Describe itself as systematic or report search strategies using multiple databases Define the scope of the review (including key questions and the applicable population) Either include quantita tive or qualitative synthesis of the data or explain why it is not indicated Note: this element does not address the quality of the systematic review: simply whether or not it exists. Concerns about quality or bias of the review will be discussed in text , where the analyst will explain whether the weaknesses of the review weaken the validity or reliability of the guideline. Note: a guideline may be rated B on this domain even if the review on which it is based is not available to us. This potential weakn ess of the guideline should be discussed in text of the report. 5. Grading the supporting evidence A Specific supporting evidence (or lack thereof) for each recommendation is cited and graded B Specific supporting evidence (or lack thereof) for each recommendation is cited but the recommendation is not graded. C Recommendations are not supported by specific evidence. OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 85 To score a B on this domain there should be specific citations to evidence tables or individual references for each relevant recommen dation in the guideline, or an indication that no evidence was available. Any standardized grading system is acceptable for purposes of this rating. If a guideline reports that there is no evidence available despite a thorough literature search, it may be scored B on this domain, or even A if evidence for other recommendations is cited and graded. 6. Recommendations A Considerations for each recommendation are documented (i.e. benefits and harms of a particular action, and/or strength of the evidence); and recommendations are presented in an actionable form. B Either one or the other of the above criteria is met. C Neither of the above criteria are met In order to be actionable, the guideline should specify the specific population to which the guideline applies, the specific intervention in question, and the circumstances under which it should be carried out (or not carried out). The language used in the recommendations should also be consistent with the strength of the recommendation (e.g. dire ctive and active language like \"should\" or \"should not\" for strong recommendations, and passive language like \"consider\" for weak recommendations). A figure or algorithm is considered actionable as long as it is complete enough to incorporate all the appli cable patients and interventions. Please see the forthcoming NICE manual (24) for a good discussion of actionability in guidelines. 7. External review A Guideline was made available to external groups for review. B Guideline was reviewed by members of the sponsoring body only. C Guideline was not externally reviewed. NR No external review process is described. 8. Updating and currency of guideline A Guideline is current and an expiration date or update process is specified. B Guideline is curre nt but no expiration date or update process is specified. C Guideline is outdated. A guideline is considered current if it is within the developers' stated validity period, or if no period or expiration data is stated, the guideline was published in the past three years (NOTE: the specific period may be changed at the analyst's discretion, based on whether the technology is mature and whether there is a significant amount of recent evidence). A guideline must address new evidence when it is updated. A gu ideline which is simply re - endorsed by the panel without searching for new evidence must be considered outdated OHSU Health Office of Clinical Integrat ion and Evidence -Based Practice 86 Appe ndix C.
