Every autumn and winter, many children and adults suffer from the familiar flu symptoms. Body aches and pains, congestion, fever and chills - we all know the symptoms of the flu. During these seasons, we are inundated with information about the flu shot, and other latest standard medical products. As a physician, I receive many inquiries regarding the natural or homeopathic approach to flu prevention. This is the following list of general recommendations during the flu season: - Common sense - you have it, use it. - Frequent hand washing - Avoid swimming during autumn and winter, especially for susceptible children and adults. - Get plenty of rest - Avoid becoming chilled, wear an extra thin layer of clothing - If your child is ill, keep him or her at home - Minimize junk food (refined sugar compromises the immune system) In my office, many families take the natural product called [Winter Tonic.](http://drfeder.com/index.php?page=shop&action=browseProducts&categoryID=10) It has been used in Europe for years during the flu season. Every year, the World Health Organization predicts which flu viruses are most likely to infect and cause flu symptoms. Winter Tonic is a combination of flu types from 1918 to the present. It is updated every year with the latest flu vaccine. The combination of flu types is then combined with ingredients that help your body adjust and respond the cold and flu. Winter Tonic (4 pellets) can be taken once a week during the cold and flu season. Another common homeopathic medicine used during the flu season is [Oscillococcinum](index.php?page=shop&action=browseProducts&categoryID=3) . Oscillococcinum is useful for all types of flu, especially in the earlier stages. Many of my patients claim that Oscillo greatly shortened the duration of the flu. It can be used for both children and adults. "}
