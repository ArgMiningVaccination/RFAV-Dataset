Deborah has fascinating wisdom to share on the most essential ways to consider energy, love, self-care, and connection. In episode 27, Sophia explores Deborah's perspectives on money and its energetic influence on our well-being and even on our children. Deborah describes the energetic powers of money, and that we should consider money's energetic exchange. For example, does how much we charge, or pay, for something feel like a balanced energetic exchange? Can charging or paying more for something actually be more helpful for those we are trying to help? This is an interesting perspective for everyone. But it may be especially helpful to those who work in the nonprofit, healthcare, health & wellness, or healing services since these caregivers often limit their openness to receive more money because of their passion to help others. Often, they feel that money isn't a priority. But, should it be? In this podcast, you will hear how charging or paying a thoughtful amount can serve those you are trying to help. Deborah and Sophia also talk about how parents can consider providing children with the opportunity to earn things. Podcast Intro When I was young, my mother advised me to never talk about money. She explained that money, especially if you have more than others, can change relationships and how people react to you, or interact with you. I have spent the rest of my life observing when this is true. As a social entrepreneur who works to help others, I struggle with how to charge for my work. Since my main goals are to help others--especially parents, children, the unborn, and the chronically sick--many parts of me want to work for free. But then there are practical benefits from charging more for my work, like being able to help more people and even to help myself to more self-care. I know that many of you also share this tendency. That's why this podcast is so important. I ask a beloved healer, Deborah Hanekamp, who is founder of Space by Mama Medicine and author of [Ritual Baths: Be Your Own Healer](https://amzn.to/357Dlcu) (paid link), about her perspectives on money. Who better for me to talk to about my issues with money than a healer who is successful no matter how you define success. (image above is a paid link) This conversation, which was recorded in May 2019, was especially meaningful to me because I have gotten to know Deborah as a really special person. She is the real deal. In this podcast, some topics covered include: - How to think about charging money for your services, which can be especially challenging for those whose services are very integrated with their heart and soul - What Deborah learned about how much money to charge, or request, from running her own yoga studio - That how much you charge is an energetic exchange - Her time period of wanting to do anything but energy work - Deborah's financial background and her odd jobs: babysitting, bartending, detailing cars - Being a workaholic - Evolution of wellness trends - Great advice for parents and how to provide children with the opportunity to experience how good it feels to do things themselves You can actually listen to the very first time I met and spoke to Deborah in episode 11 of the Practical Nontoxic Living podcast. You'll hear me have my first-ever conversation with someone who sees spirits and people's auras, which are colors that we emanate. I was spooked at first, but I left the conversation with so many liberating and soothing ideas to consider. And if you check out the podcast show notes at [www.nontoxicliving.tips,](http://www.nontoxicliving.tips) you'll see a video of the second time I saw Deborah, which is when she agreed to conduct opening and closing ceremonies for my Innovators of Wellness event in the late Zaha Hadid's first and only residential building in Manhattan. -- Before we get started though, I must highly recommend my new workbooks. One is called [Home Detox Workbook: Checklists to Eliminate Toxic Chemicals](https://www.ruanliving.com/detox-deep-dive-workbooks) second is titled [EMF Detox Workbook: Checklists to Recover from Electromagnetic Exposure](https://www.ruanliving.com/detox-deep-dive-workbooks) (paid link). They were designed to enhance their online offerings that are offered together as the [Essential Detox](https://www.ruanliving.com/d-tox-academy-membership), which also includes the online Home Detox and EMF Detox counterparts, an online Q&A forum, and a Detox 101 intro. These workbooks, however, are extremely helpful without their online enhancements. They simplify detoxing chemicals, heavy metals, and EMFs from what you buy, own, and do while protecting your joy and convenience.

And, my apologies on behalf of my family's dog, Lola, who you'll hear in the beginning as she breathes into the microphone and chews on her bone... Recorded May 29, 2009 Topics: - Charging money by asking for donations - Energy exchange: When you pay for something, you appreciate it the experience more. If you don't pay for it, you'll leave the yoga class early or won't take it as seriously. - Energy shifted after changing yoga donation from: suggested donation to requested donation. - Suggested donation: pretty much everyone did but small amount - Requested donation: pretty much what everyone donated - In wellness space, there's a convoluted relationship with money View this post on Instagram Related Content Mama Medicine on Practical Nontoxic Living podcast episode #11.
