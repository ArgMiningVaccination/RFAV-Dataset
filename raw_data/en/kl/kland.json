We are so proud to have connected with so many individuals through the years, having touched and nourished every single person. \"The retreats have massively reduced heavy metal poisoning that has plagued me most of my adult life crippling my circulatory systems and heart. Better, the skills and information I absorbed have changed by lifestyle immensely.\" \"When I arrived two years ago my blood pressure was 205/100 on medication. Today my pressure is 120/70 without taking medication. Thank you David and Marcia and staff for giving me the tools for my health transformation.\" \"What an amazing experience! My joints feel so much better. I can feel myself \"melting away\" in a good way. A great staff, great foods prepared with so much love in a soft green paradise. Thanks "}
