How Does Spinal Decompression Work? Spinal Decompression uses state of the art technology to apply a distraction force to relieve nerve compression often associated with low back pain and sciatica. Non-Surgical Spinal Decompression, slowly lengthens and decompresses the spine, creating negative pressures within the discs. This reversal of pressure creates an intradiscal vacuum that helps to reposition bulging discs and pull extruded disc material back into place, taking pressure off pinched nerves. Spinal experts believe that nutrients, oxygen, and fluids are drawn into the disc to create a revitalized environment conducive to healing. About Chiropractic Treatment: What is chiropractic treatment? Chiropractic treatment is an alternative medicine to treat back pain through manipulation of the spine. Chiropractic technique involves use of the practitioners' hands to press, pull and otherwise adjust the spine, neck, joints and surrounding soft tissues. Spinal manipulation is thought to correct misaligned vertebrae, helping lessen back pain and reduce muscle spasms. Insurance companies typically cover visits to the chiropractor. Established in 2002.

From the moment I walked into the clinic, I was greeted with a warm welcome from the staff and was impressed by the cleanliness and professionalism of the office. During my initial consultation, Dr. took the time to listen to my concerns and thoroughly explain the treatment plan that she had in mind. From the very first adjustment that I received, I felt an immediate improvement in my back pain. Over the next several visits, Dr. continued to provide personalized care and adjustments that allowed me to regain much of my mobility and flexibility. Thanks to Dr.yasini's expertise and dedication to her patients,I am extremely grateful that I did not have to undergo surgery for my bulging disc. Dr. Yasini's chiropractic adjustments helped me regain much of my mobility and flexibility that I thought I had lost forever. Her attention to detail and commitment to her patients' overall health and well-being truly sets her apart from other chiropractors. I highly recommend Dr. Yasini for anyone seeking relief from back pain or other related issues. Her positive attitude and energy are infectious, and you can tell that she e truly cares about each and every one of her patients. Thank you, Dr. for all that you do! - 11/19/2021 I came in with stiff neck and shoulders that I had had for a whole week, and I felt Dr. Yassini's adjustment immediately after the first appointment! Of course since my stiffness was pretty bad and on both sides, it didn't take only 1 appointment to make everything better (the stiffness keeps coming back, though never as bad as before i started seeing Dr. Yassini- I think it might be my pillows). I have been seeing her for 3 sessions now and my stiffness went away after every session! She's not as talkative as other chiropractors I've been to but I do not mind that at all as long as she can help me with my chiropractic needs, which she has. Also, Dory at the front desk is also really nice. I look forward to my sessions here. - 3/4/2022 If I could have given something less than 1-star, I would have given them that. The worst business I have come across. The front desk person is extremely rude. Calls at the last minute before appointment and tells you will pay upfront without explaining any details on whether they will submit claims to insurance. Then she says all patient pays us the \"cash rate\" which is much cheaper than insurance rate. That concerned me since we needed to make sure that the paid amount to this business goes towards our insurance. So when I asked her to confirm that they will send the claims to insurance or not, she says we are calling them \"dishonest\". I cannot comment on the quality of the service that the doctor provides, but I would avoid the business since every person in a business should operate under the same integrity and professionalism. - 4/7/2021 I've read other reviews where they mention they have felt an immediate improvement after a session with her and didn't think it could be true but it absolutely is! Dr. Yassini is stellar! I came here after seeing another chiropractor in Union City who I found to be negligent. After 3 visits with that guy and spending less than 5 minutes in each visit, I saw absolutely no improvement. I've been seeing Dr. Yassini for the last couple of weeks and before the end of my first visit she knew the issue and had my action plan. Things have only gotten better since with each visit. Dr. Yassini and her staff are so kind and patient and her office is very clean. She spends time to listen to your complaints and has a variety of equipment to treat you with. If you're second guessing your current relationship with your chiropractor just do yourself a favor and switch to Dr. Yassini. - 8/13/2021 Thankful to have found Dr. Yassini when I hurt my back. She right away was able to pin point the location and knew exactly how treat my problem Dr.Yassini is very knowledgeable, professional and takes pride in her work and actually gets to know you as person. Being a competitor athlete I was fortunate to have found her because she had help me continue doing what I love doing which allowed me take in a few victories :) - 11/14/2021 Dr.Yassini is truly amazing, caring , professional & a stellar doctor! I whole heartedly recommend her. My spouse recommended me to see Dr.Yassini when I had a an excruciating neck pain, couldn't sit up from the bed! She identified the exact problem & treated me with decompression and some adjustments. That was an instant relief and I was able to sit up without pain and do all regular activities the next day. Now I've been seeing her since 8-9 months now for stiff neck , some back issues and shoulder pain. At the end of every visit I feel so relieved in my neck and back area. She has some really good equipments and uses them in combination with the manual adjustments which I've found to be VERY effective! In addition to providing QUALITY care , she also tries to connect with you and know you personally which is so impressive! She truly has magical hands and I feel very fortunate to have found her!! :) :) This review is just a small opportunity to say thanks to you Dr.Youssini. - 10/8/2020 I am posting this for my wife, as Yelp is having issues when she does it... I have been going to Dr. Yassini for almost a year now, and I can honestly say that if you are suffering with back pain go see her. My recovery has been amazing! I suffer from herniated discs and age degenerative disc disease. I was seeing a medical doctor who kept sending me to the surgery center for various shots in my spine, this did not work. I started having horribly painful back spasms and could barely move. Dr. Yassini started treating me with a combination of spinal decompression and adjustments and within a couple of months the spasms stopped and I was on the road to recovery. I have now entered wellness/maintenance care and only see her once every two weeks for an adjustment. I tell everyone who will listen about Dr. Yassini and truly recommend her for any chiropractic care you may need, she is amazing. - 7/10/2021 I've had severe backaches, shoulder pain, and tension neck pain. I've seen many doctors regarding my pain and all they do is write me prescription to elevate my pain. Nothing seem to be helping. After my first treatment visit with Dr. Yassini, I could tell immediate improvement. She knew exactly where my pain areas were and she targeted just that. After a few visits I feel so much better now. I don't have to take pain medication anymore. Thank you Dr. Yassini! Love, Zarban Noor - 12/6/2021 Have you ever said to yourself, \"I should have done this earlier\"? That is how I felt after seeing Dr. Yassini. I was experiencing sciatic nerve pain that was impeding my ability to walk and drive. I was using OTC pain relievers, patches, and creams with little improvement. After my first visit with Dr. Yassini, I had immediate relief and no reoccurrence on the excruciating pain I was experiencing. By seeing her regularly, she addresses any discomfort that comes up. She listens and reassures me when I think I am too stiff or unable to relax. I leave there feeling like a million dollars. She has become an important part of my preventative care by taking away the aches and pains so I can keep my body healthy and active for many years to come. I want to also mention that her office superstar, Dory, is so nice and friendly, taking care of everyone who comes in. - 7/6/2020 I highly recommend Dr. Y for your chiropractic needs. She is very knowledgeable but not in a way that makes you feel dumb. She has no problem explaining everything that's going on and I really appreciate the depth she goes to make sure you feel safe and comfortable. Not to mention, we should be doing everything we can to help support our locally owned businesses right now. If you have any issues or not even sure if you do but want to get checked out, Dr. Y is the person you need to talk to. ASAP.
