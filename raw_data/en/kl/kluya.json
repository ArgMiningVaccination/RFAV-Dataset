Authored by Andrew Wakefield and 12 others, the paper's scientific limitations were clear when it appeared in 1998.2 3 As the ensuing vaccine scare took off, critics quickly pointed out that the paper was a small case series with no controls, linked three common conditions, and relied on parental recall and beliefs.4 Over the following decade, epidemiological studies consistently found no evidence of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism.5 6 7 8 By the time the paper was finally retracted 12 years later,9 after forensic dissection at the General Medical Council's (GMC) longest ever fitness to practise hearing,10 few people could deny that it was fatally flawed both scientifically and ethically. But it has taken the diligent scepticism of one man, standing outside medicine and science, to show that the paper was in fact an elaborate fraud. In a series of articles starting this week, and seven years after first looking into the MMR scare, journalist Brian Deer now shows the extent of Wakefield's fraud and how it was perpetrated (doi:10.1136/bmj.c5347).

Alex Snelgrove... something for you: \"I am certain that what most parents of a child with regressive-type autism want to know is what happened to their child's brain. I certainly do.\" Who wouldn't want to know what was going on? \"Not only was my son's physical development from birth normal, he was also bright and alert.\" Here's a criterion for you: A. Apparently normal development for at least the first 2 years after birth as manifested by the presence of age-appropriate verbal and nonverbal communication, social relationships, play, and adaptive behavior. \"Before he was two, he knew who he was, and he knew who we were. He knew he was a member of our family and he could relate well until shortly after his second birthday when his personality and behaviour gradually changed.\" Another one: C. Abnormalities of functioning in at least two of the following areas: (2) qualitative impairments in communication (e.g., delay or lack of spoken language, inability to initiate or sustain a conversation, stereotyped and repetitive use of language, lack of varied make-believe play) \"Words that he was familiar with using and understanding weren't there for him any more, and severe behavioural problems ensued. Deafness was suspected at first because he didn't respond to his name but was dismissed by a standard hearing test.\" B. Clinically significant loss of previously acquired skills (before age 10 years) in at least two of the following areas: (1) expressive or receptive language \"He spoke to himself in jibberish\" Again: B. Clinically significant loss of previously acquired skills (before age 10 years) in at least two of the following areas: (1) expressive or receptive language \"and was echolalic,\" And again: B. Clinically significant loss of previously acquired skills (before age 10 years) in at least two of the following areas: (1) expressive or receptive language C. Abnormalities of functioning in at least two of the following areas: (2) qualitative impairments in communication (e.g., delay or lack of spoken language, inability to initiate or sustain a conversation, stereotyped and repetitive use of language, lack of varied make-believe play) \"and at age four he still couldn't recognise or tell you his name.\" Yet again: B. Clinically significant loss of previously acquired skills (before age 10 years) in at least two of the following areas: (1) expressive or receptive language \"At two, he became solitary.\" Another two criteria: C. Abnormalities of functioning in at least two of the following areas: (1) qualitative impairment in social interaction (e.g., impairment in nonverbal behaviors, failure to develop peer relationships, lack of social or emotional reciprocity) B. Clinically significant loss of previously acquired skills (before age 10 years) in at least two of the following areas: (2) social skills or adaptive behavior \"His speech therapist suspected autism.\" Understandable, but wrong. \"His pediatrician diagnosed him with Asperger's Syndrome, at that time considered to be the high-functioning form of autism.\" That was such a bad diagnosis that it wasn't even good enough to be wrong! \"An autism specialist diagnosed Developmental Aphasia, Central Auditory Processing Disorder and hyperaccusis.\" This I cannot understand the basis of... \"A world-renowned autism expert we consulted in the mid 1990s said my son didn't have autism or Aspergers Syndrome because there was a valid explanation for his behaviours. They stemmed, he said, from his severe language and auditory processing disorders.\" They were correct in the first part. As for the second, I'm not so sure. \"Soon afterwards, the result of Dr Bernard Rimland's ARI checklist for autism arrived in the mail. My son had Classic Kanner's Syndrome.\" Sorry, but - as you'll soon see - this is also incorrect; plus, ARI's forms... they are not good. Even with the information you have given I can tell you what people at your end should be looking at for the correct diagnosis. I'll mark in the block quote the things you have mentioned so far... (QUOTE) A. Apparently normal development for at least the first 2 years after birth as manifested by the presence of age-appropriate verbal and nonverbal communication, social relationships, play, and adaptive behavior. THIS ONE B. Clinically significant loss of previously acquired skills (before age 10 years) in at least two of the following areas: (1) expressive or receptive language THIS ONE (present earlier and then lost) (2) social skills or adaptive behavior THIS ONE (present earlier and then lost) (3) bowel or bladder control (4) play (5) motor skills C.

The disturbance is not better accounted for by another specific Pervasive Developmental Disorder or by Schizophrenia. (END QUOTE) I can tell you - based on what you have told here - that criterion D is also fulfilled. From what you say, you son does indeed have a named syndrome, but it is neither Asperger syndrome nor Kanner syndrome. Given the prima facie fulfilment of the criteria in the block quote, the diagnosticians in your son's case should be investigating the possibility of Heller syndrome (DSM IV-TR: 299.10; ICD 10 CH5: F84.3). The ICD 10 introductory description of Heller syndrome is as follows: (QUOTE) F84.3 Other childhood disintegrative disorder A type of pervasive developmental disorder that is defined by a period of entirely normal development before the onset of the disorder, followed by a definite loss of previously acquired skills in several areas of development over the course of a few months. Typically, this is accompanied by a general loss of interest in the environment, by stereotyped, repetitive motor mannerisms, and by autistic-like abnormalities in social interaction and communication. In some cases the disorder can be shown to be due to some associated encephalopathy but the diagnosis should be made on the behavioural features. Dementia infantilis Disintegrative psychosis Heller's syndrome THIS NAME Symbiotic psychosis (END QUOTE) The actual criteria are - for all practical purposes - the same as the DSM IV-TR set... any differences are minor (DSM has traditionally followed ICD lines). ICD 10 actually specifies that the behavioural outcomes in section C are 'autistic-like'. This is not a diagnosis; nobody can make a diagnosis without seeing the person being diagnosed. Rather, this is an attempt to shed some light on your son's development and how it really ought to be interpreted diagnostically. Your son would seem to have gone along a developmental path more suggestive of Heller syndrome than any other PDD-list syndrome. I hope this clears a few things up. Incidentally, Heller syndrome was the original PDD listed in the research that Wakefield had been doing (at least, based on the evidence presented by Brian Deer on his site pages regarding the Wakefield scandal). I am likely to be writing an article on Heller syndrome shortly. David N. Andrews M. Ed., C. P. S. E. Psychologist (Teaching, Learning & Development) Finland Competing interests: No competing interests John Stone: \"In the light of this it would seem that the central theme of Brian Deer's article rests on an outdated (DSM IV 1994) definition of Autism.\" A bit egregious with your avoidance issues, are you not? The paper was published in 1998: the definition of autism current at the time - in the United States - was that in DSM IV. In the UK, where these children were assessed, the definition used was that found in ICD 10, Chapter 5. Competing interests: No competing interests UCL takes any allegation of research misconduct very seriously, and we will certainly investigate those raised in the BMJ. At this point, however, we have not been given the opportunity to view all of the articles to be published in the BMJ relating to this issue. We are therefore currently able to give only a general institutional response to the issues so far raised. At the time the research relating to February 1998's Lancet paper was conducted the Royal Free Medical School was not part of UCL. The Royal Free and University College Medical School was formed via a merger of the two schools in August 1998 and has been known as UCL Medical School since October 2008. It is over a decade since this research was carried out and major relevant institutional changes in that time mean that circumstances are very different from when these events occurred. Significant changes include a reorganisation of ethics approval processes and a merger of previously separate research and development activities at UCL, University College Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust. This latter step has provided a much greater degree of integration, improved exchange of information across the NHS-University boundary, and the establishment of common processes and standards. Substantial additional resources have been made available for research and development within UCL, meaning relevant regulatory processes and the overall monitoring and audit of research have all been improved. In light of the GMC's findings in January 2010, UCL initiated a review of its present research governance structures and processes to test their robustness in the context of the case. This review, which is ongoing, aims to identify any lessons that can be learnt and ensure that everything possible is in place to prevent a similar situation in the future. In reference to the BMJ's recent request for UCL to investigate Andrew Wakefield's research papers, we fully acknowledge the need to look closely at the research of someone alleged in your article to have carried out research misconduct and for this process to be subject to external scrutiny, in line with our procedures in this area. We are carefully considering how we might conduct this investigation in light of the complex legal, practical and logistical aspects involved. We are determined to learn from the mistakes made in relation to this case. It will, unfortunately, never be possible to have a system which absolutely guarantees to prevent research misconduct - and it is vital that governance procedures avoid obstructing valuable research. Our objective is to continue refining a structure and processes which provide all reasonable safeguards whilst also facilitating the highest quality research for population benefit. Professor Sir John Tooke, Vice-Provost (Health), UCL Professor David Price, Vice-Provost (Research), UCL Competing interests: No competing interests The book, 'The Cry and the Covenant' by Morton Thompson was first published in 1949: I read it as a teenager in 1975. The novel, based on the life of Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian obstetrician, profoundly affected me and certainly influenced my decision to become a doctor. Puerperal fever was common in mid-19th-century hospitals in Europe and there was a high mortality - between 10 - 35% at that time. By 1847, Semmelweis had discovered that the incidence of puerperal fever could be drastically cut by hand-washing with a chlorinated lime solution. His research and the statistics he compiled showed that in the Vienna General Hospital, the doctor's wards had three times the mortality of the midwife supervised wards. The application of the Semmelweis practice of hand- washing reduced puerperal mortality to below 1 % and subsequently earned him the description of \"saviour of mothers\". Sadly, Semmelweis's observations conflicted with the established scientific and medical opinion of the time; his perfectly reasonable hand- washing suggestions were ridiculed and rejected by his contemporise and by Professor Johann Klein, the medical director and his first boss in Vienna. Klein is alleged to have instructed, \"'Keep yourself to what is old, for that is good. If our ancestors have proven it to be good, why should we not do as they did? Mistrust new ideas. I have no need of learned men. I need faithful subjects. He who would serve me must do what I command. He who cannot do this or who comes full of new ideas may go his way. If he does not, I shall send him.' Do you understand, Dr. Semmelweis?\" It was Klein who subsequently stripped Semmelweis of his university position and repeatedly blocked his career progress in Vienna. However, Dr Semmelweis did have some support among his students, and JF von Arneth explained how he saw the situation of medicine vis-a-vis his innovation, and innovations in general. \"Do you know,\" said Arneth slowly, \"it's true of your discovery as it has been of every discovery in the whole history of medicine. When we take our medical oath we undertake to lengthen life and ease suffering. We are all united in seeking new means. And every time a man has come forward with a demonstrable truth, a remedy for good, the profession seems to have done its best to crush the discoverer and hide the discovery. No quackery - no criminality - nothing seems to make us so furious as a discovery.\" [1] Of course, the 'Semmelweis reflex' is a metaphor for a certain type of human behaviour characterised by a reflex-like rejection of new knowledge because it contradicts entrenched norms, beliefs and other establishment paradigms.

The uncertainty bounds calculations were \"based on Monte Carlo simulations that account for uncertainty in key input variables i.e., vaccination coverage and case-fatality ratios\". A summary of measles case notifications received from 169 (88%) - 180 (94%) nations between 2000 and 2008, respectively, indicated that, globally, measles cases reduced from 852,937 in 2000 to 278,358 in 2008. These figures include \"aggregated annual case counts as reported by member states\".1,2 Given the short incubation period (10-14 days) of measles, these figures appear to suggest that the case-fatality ratio for measles varied, on average between 86% in 2000 and 59% in 2008. Yet, rigorous reviews studies have shown that case fatality ratios for measles are generally between 5-10%, with only one major outlier out of 102 studies - a case- fatality ratio of 40.16% from a 1981 study in rural Gambia. Prospective studies of case fatality ratios are inherently unethical, while retrospective studies may be compromised by recall bias, difficulty ensuring that rash and fever cases are truly attributable to measles, and challenges in obtaining a representative sample of measles case- patients.3,4 nevertheless, the validity of 2000-2008 global measles data remain questionable. WHO defines a measles-associated death as \"one occurring within 30 days of rash onset, not obviously due to another cause such as trauma\".5 This criterion is practical and feasible for vital registration in developing nations. It is more probable that numbers of new measles infections are being chronically under-reported, partly due to international pressure on health bureaucrats for \"progress results\", and potential conflicts of interest - the health ministry officials authorised to compile measles annual reports are the same staff employed to reduce measles incidence through vaccination and case management. Just as new epidemiological tools data enabled the downward revision of global maternal mortality numbers in 20106, systematic analyses of the measles caseload is likely to result in upward revision of global measles incidence. Such analyses are urgently required. References 1) Dabbagh A, Gacic-Dobo M, Simons E 2000-2008. 2009; 58: 1321-1326. 2) World Health Organization.

Competing interests: No competing interests I am certain that what most parents of a child with regressive-type autism want to know is what happened to their child's brain. I certainly do. Not only was my son's physical development from birth normal, he was also bright and alert. Before he was two, he knew who he was, and he knew who we were. He knew he was a member of our family and he could relate well until shortly after his second birthday when his personality and behaviour gradually changed. Words that he was familiar with using and understanding weren't there for him any more, and severe behavioural problems ensued. Deafness was suspected at first because he didn't respond to his name but was dismissed by a standard hearing test. He spoke to himself in jibberish and was echolalic, and at age four he still couldn't recognise or tell you his name. At two, he became solitary. His speech therapist suspected autism. His pediatrician diagnosed him with Asperger's Syndrome, at that time considered to be the high-functioning form of autism. An autism specialist diagnosed Developmental Aphasia, Central Auditory Processing Disorder and hyperaccusis. A world-renowned autism expert we consulted in the mid 1990s said my son didn't have autism or Aspergers Syndrome because there was a valid explanation for his behaviours. They stemmed, he said, from his severe language and auditory processing disorders. Soon afterwards, the result of Dr Bernard Rimland's ARI checklist for autism arrived in the mail. My son had Classic Kanner's Syndrome. No wonder Brian Deer is confused about what autism is and what it is not. I dare say most people including medical professionals are similarly confused when mental health doctors now call autism a spectrum and refer to anyone with a condition on that spectrum as autistic. That, for instance, Albert Einstein, Bill Gates, Michaelangelo, Joy Adamson, Lewis Carroll, Jane Austen, Aldous Huxley, and Beethoven could possibly have had a remotely similar condition to Rain Man and the young man in The Black Balloon. And that two of the most prominent autism experts and authors, Simon Baron-Cohen and Tony Attwood, consider autism to be no more of a disability than left-handedness or simply a difference in personality which is a far cry from the early 1990s when autism was described as a devastating disorder which had a hopeless \"there's nothing you can do\" prognosis. I think it is high time mental health professionals using behavioural checklists to diagnose autism took a back seat because this psychiatric diagnosis is totally meaningless and useless. It is merely a collective description for symptoms that may be severe, moderate, mild, or very mild. It doesn't give a clear picture of the person at all, or the reason for his or her difficulties. It is also an impediment to proper medical treatment because from the point of diagnosis onwards \"the autism\" is considered by health professionals to be the cause of all the problems that arise whether psychiatric or physical, and doctors won't look beyond to what is actually wrong with the child. For some children, it could be an auditory problem, as Eileen Nicole Simon pointed out. Some hearing impaired children have similar behaviours to autistic children, called deafisms. Some blind children also have autistic behaviour, called \"blindisms\". Do our children with regressive autism suffer from perceptual problems? Yes they do. But these problems were not evident for the first 18 months or so in their development. Something happened to change the way their brains processed what they saw, heard, and touched. Anxiety replaced curiosity. Andrew Wakefield was the first doctor to investigate the gastrointestinal symptoms of children with regression. He did not tell the parents that these problems were a symptom of their autism and turn them away, as most doctors would do. Wakefield's case study \"associated (the children's regression) in time with possible environmental triggers\". He did not say that autism is caused by the MMR vaccine. The problem I believe is that medical specialists aren't getting their heads together over this. Gastroenterologists, neurologists, immunologists rely heavily on diagnoses given primarily by psychiatrists and psychologists when all they are doing is giving a subjective opinion based on a behavioural checklist. If the patient has verbal or non-verbal language impairments, social impairment, and engages in repetitive activities, it's autism which is, they say, a mysterious condition that doesn't have a cause or a cure. Although I'm sure they're right that there isn't a singular cause or a singular cure for autism, there are definite causes for these symptoms, such as an encephalitis. Unfortunately, it is not the job of mental health professionals to investigate or identify a cause, or refer patients on to other specialists who might shed some light on the cause of the condition, so the child's parents are left floundering. And as we know from successful claims for vaccine injury compensation, those of Hannah Poling and Bailey Banks for instance, once the cause for the symptoms is known, the condition is no longer called autism. The symptoms are the result of vaccine injury that look collectively just like autism, but it's not autism. Research should be focused on children with regression because epidemiological studies of children with an autism diagnosis are not going to identify the group of children who have lost skills. There is a huge difference between children born with a developmental disorder and those with regression. Watching your own mentally and physically normal child regress and lose skills and the ability to communicate and relate is a heartbreaking experience. What Andrew Wakefield and his team did was what all doctors should do and that is to ignore the diagnosis and to physically examine the children to rule out medical causes for their regression and behaviour. Auditory processing disorders and sub-clinical epilepsy, for example. How many of our children with regression have epileptic conditions that are not being recognised by parents or doctors, and therefore remain untreated, resulting in a worse outcome? And when parents suspect seizures, is a twenty minute EEG sufficiently long enough to rule them out, or would an MEG be far more accurate? According to this study, \"Although less than 15% of the (80) children had a history of clinical seizures, MEG revealed epileptiform activity in >60%.\" and \" For approximately 20% of the children with an abnormal MEG, the simultaneous EEG was within normal limits.\" [http://imfar.confex.com/imfar/2009/webprogram/Paper5097.html](http://imfar.confex.com/imfar/2009/webprogram/Paper5097.html) Our children with regression diagnosed with Pervasive Developmental Disorders are a severely neglected group. If Fiona Godlee, Jane Smith and Harvey Marcovitch, or Brian Deer, were to gradually lose their ability to speak and communicate over the next few weeks or months, developed aggression towards others and/or self, and began to engage in meaningless repetitive activities, I am quite sure they would want and their family members would expect medical doctors to carry out thorough physical examinations and a raft of tests to find out what is going on. They wouldn't calmly accept a psychiatrist's diagnosis whatever it might be because their symptoms matched one of his or her behavioural checklists, and he or she told them it was a mysterious condition that was untreatable. If I am right, why should they vilify Dr Wakefield for investigating bowel problems that were evident in his patients? Would the authors agree that neither children nor adults have dramatic changes in their personality, stop communicating, have exaggerated responses to normal environmental stimuli and lose speech and other skills without a cause, and that it is negligent of the medical profession to not investigate a condition to search for that cause? Even if vaccines are implicated? Because what parents like myself want to know is: What happened to our children? At least Andrew Wakefield was willing to take a look at one of the common symptoms that our children with regression have, while the rest of the mainstream medical profession appear to be content to sit on their hands, do nothing, and leave it to the psychologists. Competing interests: My son regressed after vaccines. He has never received the MMR. Dear Sir, Since Rebecca Fisher is an interested Publishing executive, with apparently no stated vested interests, (although the words \"as expected\" and \"apologists\" result in a slight holding of breath..., but she raised a valid question which I would like answered. Which parts of Brian Deer's article are false? Perhaps she (or someone like her) would be prepared to set up a website which would upload, with permission of the parents of all disputed 12 children (who would no doubt, be delighted to agree): 1) All the information the 12 specialists at Royal Free hospital had at their disposal while examining the children, as well as the files they constructed on the children; 2) Referral letters from GPs to Royal Free, describing the children's problems. 3) All the information from the GP and other files which Royal Free did not have at their disposal; 4) Web facilities to view any radiological scans which might be relevant. Then set up an interactive forum (perhaps V-bulletin) with four forums: a) One forum for Brian Deer can show with reference to the original data from the GPs and the hospital why he believes he is correct in all his statements. b) Another forum for any or all of the 12 specialists involved in the original medical article, including Andrew Wakefield, to upload and comment on medical material, explaining why Mr Deer's article and many other statements are false, as well as any other related matters to these children that they, or Mr Deer wish to discuss. c) A forum for the parents or family members of the 12 children, so that they can clarify any issues asked of them by either Brian Deer of Royal Free. The participants for the three forums above, could have access to all three forums. d) A fourth subforum within the forum ONLY allowing access for anyone else, to register at the site, and ask questions of either Brian Deer, or the 12 Royal Free experts on those two forums only..., so that the public and the media can be the judge of the answers based on factual original data. Why do I suggest this? Currently, we only hear Brian Deer's version of events, without anyone having reference to any original data. \"Climate-gate\" came about as a result of a original data-concealment, (and potential manipulation of data). Calls for disclosure of all original climate data have now been heeded in the name of honest and open science (though, will that data be tweaked first?). Given that all parties should have the same medical data, let's see them. If the issues Brian Deer writes about from that data, are as cut and dried as he says they are, then they are also cut and dried enough for anyone with a brain to also understand. Such data cannot possibly be copyright, or subject to concealment, since it rightfully belongs to both the parents and Royal Free, neither of whom presumably would have reason to deny public access to it, since if indeed, Dr Wakefield is wrong, both Brian Deer and Royal Free Hospital should be willing to prove it, and most certainly, the parents of the 12 children deserve correct answers from factual data, available for everyone to see. Many in the public would be prepared to donate money through paypal, to a reputable publishing executive with supposedly no vested interests, or biased opinion..., who seemingly has expressed a genuine interest in knowing were Mr Deer might be erring ... and seemingly..., wants an explanation. Don't we all? I hope that the suggestions above will inspire someone to provide an unbiased intelligent internet venue to discuss the issue in full, with all data, and all sides openly accountable, so that everyone can really unravel what happened, as well as to learn whatever lessons may come out of that. Hilary Butler. Competing interests: I love tracking bad science through the ages Just to point out in relation to John R Smith's helpful contribution that the diagnostic criterion for autism in the Lancet paper was \"pervasive development disorder\", and was in the title. Therefore Brian Deer picking and choosing which PDD cases counted was spurious. Competing interests: Autistic son Dr Wakefield is charged with fabricating findings on the 'ideal world ' but unrealistic assumptions that medical records are always accurate and that medical practitioners and researchers always consistent in their record-keeping. It follows that for Brian Deer in medical research there could be few questions of interpreting facts and few grounds for disagreement over differing interpretations. Deer's attack on Wakefield in this week's BMJ focuses on one set of data from the multitude provided on the 12 children in the 1998 Lancet 'early report': namely the record of when eight of the twelve children received their MMR in relation to the onset of behavioural signs that retrospectively were diagnosed as autistic spectrum disorders. Deer challenges the record that these children first displayed autistic signs following MMR and, ipso facto, questions the claim that they had a regressive form of autism. This is the main concern he raises from the rich array of data. The timing of the symptoms in relation to the date the MMR was given refers to one of five hypotheses reviewed. Deer has less concern about the other hypotheses concerning inflamed or dysfunctional intestines (although in passing he points to disagreements over the diagnosis of bowel disease), the correlation between rising incidence of autism and MMR since its introduction in 1988 (which the paper rejects for lack of reliable data in the mid-1990s), the genetic predisposition to autistic-spectrum disorders, and vitamin B12 malabsorption. Deer's focus on the timing of MMR, and his questioning of regressive autism and bowel disease, supports the claims of the manufacturers, government and medical profession that the MMR is safe. Wakefield is charged with fabrication against an unrealistic standards of accuracy and consistency where no such standards exists. Notwithstanding the GMC's findings of fact, the reality is that medical records are not always consistent and that differences in interpretation do occur. For these charges to stand, they would need to be assessed against the uncertainties and contingencies that characterise real science, not against unreal and non-existent standards. Were the GMC and Deer to be the sole tribunal of truth in applying their standards of consistency to all medical research, then it would be questionable if research could progress in the way it has and if scientific debate were possible in the form so far conducted. Wakefield provides an initial rebuttal to Deer's charges of falsifying evidence, first given in the Sunday Times, in his book 'Callous Disregard: autism and vaccines' (2010). Would the editors not agree that Wakefield has the right of replying to Deer's charges on grounds of fairness and even-handness? Competing interests: father of autistic som "}
