Clean 7 is rooted in both functional medicine and ancient Ayurvedic practices. Both medical systems recognize the powerful potential of herbs for targeting various health concerns and boosting your health in a major way. Fortunately, modern research is also catching up to what many practitioners of traditional medicine have long known. Simply put, many herbs have profound anti-inflammatory and healing properties with very few potential side effects. When it comes to keeping joints healthy and mobile over time, minimizing inflammation is key. Adaptogenic herbs in particular have some powerful health-promoting properties. Adaptogens are a family of herbs that help the body and mind cope with stress. The herbs featured in Clean 7 can help support your body's innate ability to repair itself. Whether used as preventative treatments, or to improve musculoskeletal function and reduce pain, herbal treatments, in combination with an anti-inflammatory diet, can help keep you limber, calm, and strong for years to come. Let's take a look at how Clean 7's herbs can help improve and maintain your flexibility, mobility, and joint health. Turmeric is an anti-inflammatory superhero Curcumin, the primary active ingredient in turmeric, has some truly phenomenal medicinal properties. When it comes to maintaining your joint health, there's really nothing more important than keeping inflammation in check. Research shows that chronic, low-grade inflammation is at the root of most chronic diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis. Chronic inflammation can also make osteoarthritis (the wear and tear kind) feel more painful. Not only can turmeric help ease inflammation-related pain, it can help tamp inflammation down in the body overall. Ashwagandha can help ease your joint pain Ashwagandha is a multifaceted powerhouse when it comes to your health. Not only can it help ease the effects of stress, depression, and anxiety, it's also been shown to help significantly reduce knee joint pain in some osteoarthritis patients. Further, ashwagandha is also shown to decrease inflammation markers in the body, including C-reactive protein (CRP), which is linked to cardiovascular disease. Ashwagandha can help support your mood, mental outlook, and promotes healthy sleep. Holy Basil supports joint health & mobility The health-promoting benefits of holy basil (tulsi) are vast. Not only can it help balance your moods and blood sugar, it supports immunity, and fights inflammation. Holy basil's compounds, including eugenol and cineole, decrease pain and inflammation. Holy basil can be sipped as a tea, or taken in powder and supplement form. Holy basil is packed with vitamin C and antioxidants, and is a powerful tonic for overall health and longevity. The Clean 7 protocol is designed to reset your health habits in a powerful way, in a short amount of time. While you can achieve a lot in seven days with Clean 7, lasting results come from a sustained commitment to a healthy diet, daily exercise, dialing down your stress, and getting enough rest each night. Clean 7's herbs are deeply effective traditional remedies that can transform your health, increase joint health and mobility, and bolster your energy and well-being over time.
