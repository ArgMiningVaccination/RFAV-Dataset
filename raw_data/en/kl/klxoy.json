Healthy patients return to my office for yearly flu prevention. You know what you are doing is working well when you have repeat patients, and even practitioners of conventional medicine that choose homeopathy year and year again. In the last couple of weeks, I've been getting calls from patients looking for the yearly Influenzinum strain. I am pleased to say, YES we do have it, and it's available in a couple of different potencies. Determining what potency is needed for you, or your family will require a 15-minute consultation (for existing patients only). New patients will need a longer consultation time. How does Influenzinum work? Influenzinum is a homeopathic remedy made with the current season's flu strains. Influenzinum, also known as homeopathic flu nosode, provides natural support to: - strengthen the body and increase its resistance to the season's flu viruses - protect against cold & flu symptoms such as body aches, nausea, chills, fever, headaches, sore throat, coughs, and congestion - enforce the flu vaccine's action if you have opted for the flu shot - deal with aftereffects of the flu, and alleviate adverse effects of the flu shot To schedule your flu consultation with me to see what potency is needed for you, please call 734-995-3200. Hope to have a healthy season. Dr.Uma Author Umangini Desai, CCH, RSHOM (NA), BHMS Uma joined Bio Energy Medical Center in 2000.
