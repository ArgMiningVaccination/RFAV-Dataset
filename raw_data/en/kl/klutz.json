Here, we mapped the epi- genomic and transcriptional landscape of immunity to influenza vaccination in humans at the single-cell level.Vaccination against seasonal influenza induced persistently diminished H3K27ac in monocytes and myeloiddendritic cells (mDCs), which was associated impaired cytokine responses to Toll-like receptor stimu-lation. Single-cell accessibility after vaccination. Similar were observed inresponse to vaccination with the AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccine. However, this vaccine also stimulated persistently increased chromatin accessibility at interferon response factor (IRF) loci in monocytes and mDCs. This was associated with elevated expression of antiviral genes and heightened resis-tance to the unrelated Zika and Dengue viruses. These results demonstrate that vaccination stimulatespersistent epigenomic remodeling of the innate immune system and reveal AS03's potential as an epigeneticadjuvant. INTRODUCTION Recent research has highlighted a central role for the epigenome in the regulation of fundamental biological processes. The epige- nome can maintain particular chromatin states over prolonged periods of time that span generations of cells, thus enablingthe durable storage of gene-expression information ( Allis and Je- nuwein, 2016 ). In the context of the immune system, epigenomic events have been described during hematopoiesis ( Buenrostro et al., 2018 ;Corces et al., 2016 ;Farlik et al., 2016 ), generation of immunological memory and exhaustion in T lymphocytes(Akondy et al., 2017 ;Satpathy et al., 2019 ;Youngblood et al., 2017 ), and the development of B and plasma cells ( Barwick et al., 2016 ;Kulis et al., 2015 ). Recent studies have also revealed that epigenomic changes in monocytes ( Arts et al., 2018 ;Klein- nijenhuis et al., 2012 ;Saeed et al., 2014 ) and natural killer (NK) cells ( Sun et al., 2011 ) imprint a form of immunological memory in the innate immune system ( Netea et al., 2020 ). The concept of epigenetic imprinting on the innate immune system has acquired a particular signicance in the context of vaccination ( Wimmers and ). Vaccination \u00aa2021 Elsevier Inc. 3916 Cell184, to induce in monocytes ( Arts et al., 2018 ;Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2012 ), and it has been suggested that such changes result in a durable state of innate activation. However, the extent to which such epigenomic imprinting,observed with BCG vaccination, reflects a more general phe- nomenon with other vaccines is an open question. Furthermore, the critical parameters that determine vaccination-induced epi-genomic imprinting, such as the type of vaccine or adjuvantused, or the impact of the microbiome, are not known. Notably, previous studies identied transcriptional and protein level het- erogeneity et al., 2017 ;Arunachalam et al., 2020 ;Kazer et al., 2020 ;Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020 ;See et al., 2017 ; Shalek et al., 2014 ;Villani et al., 2017 ;Wimmers et al., 2018 ). How this cellular heterogeneity affects epigenomic imprinting during an immune response to a vaccine or to any stimulus is entirely unknown. Recently, researchers have used systems biology approaches to comprehensively analyze the transcriptional, metabolic, pro- teomic, and cellular landscape in response to vaccination in humans and identied correlates and mechanisms of vaccineimmunity ( Gaucher et al., 2008 ;Hagan et al., 2015 ;Kotliarov et al., 2020 ;Li et al., 2017b ;Pulendran et al., 2010 ;Querec et Project Team; HIPC-I 2014 ;Wimmers and Pulendran, 2020 ). Despite these advances, a comprehensive systems biology assessment of the human epigenomic landscape duringan immune response, particularly at the single-cell level, is missing. In the current study, we used single-cell techniques, including EpiTOF (epigenetic landscape proling using study the epigenomicand transcriptional landscape of immunity to seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccination in humans. We found that vacci- nation with the trivalent inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine(TIV) induced global changes to the chromatin state in multiple immune cell subsets, which persisted for up to 6 months after vaccination. These changes were most pronounced in myeloidcells, which demonstrated a transition to inaccessible chromatinin loci targeted by AP-1 transcription factors, and reduced cyto- kine production. Single-cell analysis revealed distinct subclus- ters within monocyte population that were characterized accessibility. and STAT loci and heightened resistance against heterologous viral infection during in vitro culture. RESULTS Global epigenomic reprogramming of immune cell subsets after vaccination with TIVTo determine how immunization with TIV affects the epigenomic landscape of the immune system at the single-cell level, we em- ployed EpiTOF to analyze a cohort of 21 healthy individuals aged18-45 before and after TIV administration ( Data S1 ). All subjects received TIV on day 0. To determine the impact of the gut micro- biota on the epigenomic immune cell landscape, a subgroup often subjects received an additional oral antibiotic regimen, con- sisting of neomycin, vancomycin, and metronidazole, between days /C03 and 1 ( Figure 1 A). Our previous work with this cohort had demonstrated that antibiotics administration induced signif- icant changes in the transcriptional and ( Hagan et al., hypothesized antibiotics administration wouldinduce epigenomic reprogramming of PBMCs. To test these hy- potheses, we developed two EpiTOF panels and probed the global levels of 38 distinct histone marks, including acetylation,methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, citrullination, and Using EpiTOF, we Figure S1 A) isolated at day /C021 and 0 prior to vaccination, and days 1, 7, 30, and 180 after vacci- nation. While the frequency of immune cell populations did not change signicantly between these time points, we observed atrend toward reduced fractions of myeloid cells in some subjectsat later time points, and a transient increase in the proportion of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in response to antibiotics treatment (days 0, 1) ( Figure S1 B), in line with previous observa- tions ( Hagan et al., 2019 ). Next, we extracted the histone modication information for each subset and generated a uniform manifold approximationand projection (UMAP) representation of the epigenomic immune cell landscape ( Figure 1 B). In the UMAP space, lymphoid cells separated from myeloid cells, while hematopoietic progenitors(CD34 +) showed a unique epigenetic pattern distinct from fully differentiated immune cells. When generating a sample-level UMAP representation, there was a segregation of samples iso-lated at various times after vaccination, especially at day 30 rela-tive to baseline samples, indicating TIV-induced epigenetic changes ( Figure 1 C, left). In contrast to previous studies using Figure 1. TIV alters the global histone modication prole of immune cells (A) Study overview.

Rather, we observed changes in the acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation states of several histone marks in response to vaccination, regardless of exposure to antibiotics ( Figures S1 C and S1D). To enhance statistical power, we combined both groups for down-stream analyses. We detected an increase in several histone methylation marks in CD34 +cells and a decrease in multiple acet- ylation marks in myeloid cells in day 30 samples over baseline(Figure 1 D). Also, we observed increased H2BS14ph in multiple immune cell subsets at day 30 after vaccination ( Figure S1 C). Elevated H2BS14ph has been shown to occur during apoptosis(Cheung et al., 2003 ;Solier and Pommier, 2009 ;Wen et al., 2010 ). However, we did not observe reduced cell viability at any time point ( Figure S1 A), suggesting H2BS14ph functions inde- is catalyzed by Mst1/STK4, whose immune modula- tory role has been reported ( Cho et al., 2019 ;Li et al., 2017a , 2015 ;Zhou et al., H4K5ac at day 30 after vaccination E). an argi- nine deiminase citrullination, correlation analysis identied high correlation coefcients between acetylation marks and PADI4 ( Figure S1 E). PADI4 has been implicated in monocyte development, and inflammation ( Cheung et al., 2018 ;Liu et al., 2018 ;Nakashima et al., 1999 ;Vossenaar et al., 2004 ). Longitudinal analysis demonstrated a time-dependent decrease of the four histone acetylation marks and PADI4, whichshowed the greatest repression at day 30 and largely returned to baseline levels at day 180 ( Figure 1 F). Blood transcriptomics data obtained from PBMCs of the same subjects at early timepoints after vaccination ( Hagan et ( Voss et al., 2009 ) at days 1, 3, and 7 after vaccination ( Figure S2 A). In contrast, various histone deacety- lases showed increased expression ( Figure S2 expression of lysine methyltransferase EZH2 was S2 in ( Figure 1 E).Epigenomic and transcriptional analysis thus both point toward a, potentially repressive, state of hypoacetylation in myeloid cells after immunization with TIV. Next, we investigated the TIV-induced epigenomic alterations in myeloid cells at the single-cell level ( Figure 1 G). By performing sub-clustering and dimensionality reduction anal- single-cell histone modication landscape. Importantly, in both cell types, single cells segregated according to vaccination time point with cells at day 0 and 1 clustering together on oneside of the 2D space, and cells at day 30 occupying the opposite side ( Figure 1 G). Interestingly, and undetected by the bulk anal- ysis ( Figure 1 F), cells at day 180 did not return to the baseline po- sition occupied by day 0 cells but assumed an intermediate state (Figure 1 G), indicating persistent epigenetic alterations that can be detected up to 6 months after immunization with TIV. These observations raise the question of how persistent epigenetic changes lasting up to 6 months can be maintained in monocytes and mDCs, given that these cell types have a rapid turnover of less than 7 days. Recent studies indicate that suchpersistent changes in circulating myeloid cells are associated with changes in the hematopoietic progenitor cell compartment in the bone marrow ( Cirovic et al., 2020 ;Kaufmann et al., 2018 ; Mitroulis et al., 2018 ). To determine whether this was also evident here, we calculated the epigenomic distance of CD34+ cells to a consensus prole of differentiated lymphoid or myeloid cells ( Figure S3 A). We detected multiple populations of CD34+cells based on their epigenomic distances with minor populations showing relatively short distances to differentiatedimmune cells, possibly resembling pre-committed clones ( Fig- ure S3 B). After vaccination, the overall distance between CD34 +cells and differentiated cells was greatly increased ( Fig- ures S3 B-S3D) indicating a potential shift of the stem cell pool toward an immature phenotype after vaccination. At day 180, the distances returned to their pre-vaccination state. TIV induces persistent functional changes in innate immune cells To determine the functional consequence of the observed epige-netic changes in myeloid cells, we stimulated PBMCs from vaccinated individuals prior to vaccination or at various time points after vaccination, with cocktails of synthetic Toll-like re-ceptor (TLR) cytokine production (A) Schematic overview of experiment.

After 24 h of stimulation, we measured the levels of 62 secreted cytokines in culture supernatants using a multiplexed bead-based assay. Our previous work using intra- cellular staining (data not shown), as well as work by others(O'Gorman et al., 2015 ) has demonstrated that monocytes are the most abundant and dominant contributors to cytokine pro- duction upon in vitro stimulation of PBMCs with the aforemen- tioned stimuli. To determine whether PBMCs from time points af-ter vaccination showed any alterations in cytokine production, we calculated the relative change in cytokine levels compared to day 0 ( Figure 2 B). Indeed, using hierarchical clustering, we identied a subset of cytokines that displayed a signicant reduction at day 30 after vaccination ( Figure 2 B, red box, C). These cytokines include tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- a, growth factor GCSF. Similar to the kineticsof the epigenomic changes, reduced cytokine responses wereevident as early as day 1 to 7 after vaccination, reaching a nadir at day 30, and returning to near-baseline levels at day 180 ( Fig- ure 2 D). All these cytokines were strongly induced by both TLR cocktails ( Figure S4 A) and a reduction relative to day 0 was observed in both antibiotics-treated and control subjects (Figure S4 B). Next, we investigated whether there is a direct relationship between global histone modication levels and TLR-induced cytokine production. We used pairwise correlation analysis tocorrelate the cytokine levels in a sample with the EpiTOF histone modication levels in classical monocytes and with monocyte frequency in the PBMCs of the same sample and cell viability(Figure 2 E). Strikingly, the histone acetylation marks previously identied in Figure 1 C, especially H3K27ac, and PADI4 showed positive correlation with cytokine production ( Figures 2 E and 2F). In contrast, H2BS14ph and several repressive methylationmarks, including H3K27me3 and H4K20me3 ( Cao and Zhang, 2004 ;Stender et al., 2012 ), were negatively correlated with cyto- kine production ( Figure 2 E). Next, we determined whether perturbations of global histone acetylation or PADI4 activity affect TLR-induced cytokine secre-tion. We conducted an ex vivo stimulation experiment cic inhibitors for and by stimulation with synthetic Using flow cytometry, we assessed expression of H3K27ac and the intra- cellular accumulation of IL-1b global histone H3K27ac levels in classical monocytes, while treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA generated a concentration-dependentincrease (data not shown). Furthermore, treatment with the PADI4 inhibitor Cl /C0Amidine led to similar reductions in H3K27ac (data not shown) in line with the strong correlation ofPADI4 and H3K27ac levels in EpiTOF ( Figure S1 E) and the ously observed ability of PADI4 to regulate CBP/P300 ( Lee et al., 2005 ). Notably, none of these inhibitors influenced cell viability (data not shown). Next, we asked whether inhibition of CBP/P300 and PADI4 has an impact on cytokine production. Indeed, treatment with A-485 led to a major diminution in the frequency of IL-1b and TNFa positive monocytes after stimulation withLPS 2H). Cl /C0Amidine treatment, strik- ingly, led to a complete abrogation of cytokine production in these cells ( Figure 2 H). TIV induces reduced chromatin accessibility of AP-1 targeted loci in myeloid cellsTo gain greater insight into the epigenomic changes induced by vaccination, we conducted ATAC-seq analysis of fluorescence- activated cell sorting (FACS) puried innate immune cell subsetsbefore and after vaccination ( Figure 3 A). After preprocessing, we retained a high-quality dataset of 51 unique samples ( Data S3 ). To identify the molecular targets of the TIV-induced epigenomic changes, we determined genomic regions with signicantlychanged chromatin accessibility at day 30 after vaccination compared to day 0. Overall, we detected more than 10,000 differentially accessible regions (DARs) in CD14 +monocytes and/C244,500 while pDCs showed only minor changes ( Figure 3 B). In line with reduced histone acetylation Figure 3. TIV induces reduced chromatin accessibility in immune response genes and AP-1 controlled regions (A) Schematic overview of the experiment.

In contrast, comparing samples from day /C021 before antibiotics treatment and day 0 during antibiotics treatment showed a modest increase in chromatin accessibility ( Fig- ures S5 B and S5C) in line with upregulated expression of these genes in a previous analysis of the cohort ( Hagan et al., 2019 ). Notably, we did not observe an antibiotics-induced change inthe accessibility of any of the cytokines altered in Figure 2 and D0vD30 DARs correlated well between antibiotics-treated and control subjects ( Figure S5 D). Among the top 200 vaccine- in CD14 +monocytes, we identied reduced accessibility, including several C). We also observed reduced accessibility in re- gions coding for molecules associated with with seven of the ten cytokines with reduced post-vaccination levels during ex vivo stimulation showed reduced accessibility ( Figure 2 ,Figure 3 C, right panel). Interestingly, these reduced DARs were predominantly located in non-promoter regions ( Figure 3 C) suggesting the involvement of distal regulatory elements such as enhancers. Pathway anal- ysis followed by network analysis of all DARs in CD14 +mono- cytes revealed two and and genome rearrangement ( Figure 3 D). The TLR and cytokine cluster was dominated by pathways with mostly reduced chromatin accessibility, while terms in the genome rear- rangement cluster were mixed. Notably, DARs associated withsignaling pathways around Ras and MAPK signaling were en- riched as well. Next, to identify regulatory patterns, we determined whether the identied DARs in each cell type were enriched for transcrip- tion factor (TFs) binding motifs. Indeed, we observed an enrich- ment for bZIP TFs of the AP-1 and monocytes and mDCs, and on average DARs carryingsuch a motif showed a reduction in chromatin accessibility after vaccination, especially in non-promoter regions ( Figure 3 E). Overrepresentation analysis of the DARs in classical monocytesfurther conrmed this nding and showed strong enrichment for target genes of c-Jun in DARs with reduced accessibility at day 30 (Figure 3 F). In addition, we observed reduced expression of several AP-1 family members, including c-Jun, at day 30 after vaccination ( Figure 3 F). Using bulk transcriptomics data from previous systems vaccinology studies ( Barrett et al., 2013 ;Mo- hanty et al., 2015 ;Nakaya et al., 2011 ,2015 ;Thakar et al., 2015 ;Tsang et al., 2014 ), we conrmed the reduced c-Jun expression in up to 9 independent TIV studies and additionallyidentied a reduction in expression of the AP-1 membersJUND, ATF3, FOS, FOSL2, and FOSB ( Figure 3 G). Similar to the histone acetylation changes, the reduction in AP-1 TF expression was rst detected at day 7 after vaccination andwas most pronounced at day 28 ( Figure 3 G).To determine whether the observed reduction in AP-1 acces- sibility is related to the reduced levels of histone acetylation, we correlated the normalized accessibility levels of all genomic re- gions in every sample to histone mark levels in classical mono-cytes or mDCs isolated from the same sample. Using enrichment analysis on the highly correlated peaks (p %0.05), we identied a signicant enrichment of target genes for multiple AP-1 familymembers, including c-Fos and c-Jun ( Figure 3 H). These ndings suggest the possibility of a causal link between reduced histone acetylation/PADI4 and reduced AP-1 accessi- bility. Indeed, previous studies described a direct physical inter-action and functional co-dependence between AP-1 and the CBP/P300 et al., 1994 ;Kamei et al., 1996 ;Zanger et al., 2001 ). To investigate whether AP-1 ac- tivity and histone acetylation are also functionally linked in clas- sical monocytes, we conducted an ex vivo stimulation experi- using the same specic inhibitors of histone acetylationand PADI activity as in Figure 2 . To gauge AP-1 activity, we used a monoclonal antibody specic for the activated form of c-Jun, phosphorylated at serine 73. While treatment with LPS or R848 alone induced a robust upregulation of p-c-Jun thatcan be readily detected by flow cytometry ( Figures I and 3J), pre-treatment with /C0Amidine, which 3J). epigenomic and transcriptional landscape of innate immunity to TIV Previous studies using transcriptomics and proteomics ap- proaches detected heterogeneity within ( \u00b4ndez et al., ;Guilliams et al., 2017 ;Villani et al., 2017 ). However, it is unclear how this heterogeneity affects the epige-nomic landscape in such cells and their response to vaccination. To address this, we used scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq and con- structed the single-cell landscape of the innate immune responseto TIV at the epigenomic and transcriptional level. PBMCs from vaccinated individuals were isolated, enriched for DC subsets, analyzed using droplet-based single-cell gene-expressionand chromatin accessibility proling ( Figure pre- processing, we obtained chromatin accessibility data from 62,101 cells with an average of 4,126 uniquely accessible frag- ments. These cells displayed the canonical fragment size distribu-tion and showed high signal-to-noise ratio at transcription start sites (data not shown). Using UMAP representation and chrom- VAR TF deviation patterns, we generated an epigenomic map ofthe innate immune system and identied clusters for all major innate immune cell subsets, including classic and non-classical In parallel, we used the scRNA-seq data to construct a gene-expressionmap. After pre-processing, we retained 34,368 high-quality tran- scriptomes average of 2,477 genes and 8,951 unique tran- scripts detected per cell. UMAP representation in combinationwith clustering allowed us to identify all major innate immune cell subsets ( Data S4 ). These subsets were found at all vaccine time points and in samples of all subsets ( Data S4 ). Next, we used K J I Figure 4.

In addition, using the single-cell dataset, we observed that the reduction in AP-1accessibility starts early, at day 1 after vaccination ( Figure 4 C) suggesting that the TIV-induced epigenomic reprogramming is imprinted during the acute phase of the vaccine response. Atthe gene level, we observed a reduction in the expression of mul-tiple AP-1 members including ATF3, JUND, JUNB, FOS, and FOSL2 (data not shown). Next, we determined the impact of cellular heterogeneity on TIV-induced epigenomic changes. Sub-clustering analysis of classical monocytes revealed the presence of four distinct popu- lations based on chromatin accessibility ( Figure 4 D;Data S4 )w i t h different temporal patterns ( Figure 4 E): while clusters 6 and 8 dominated the classic monocyte pool at day 0, most cells at day 30 belonged to cluster 5 ( Figures 4 D and 4E). Notably, the observed heterogeneity between the classic monocyte popula-tions was driven by differences in AP-1 and, to a lesser extent, CEBP accessibility ( Figure 4 F). While the dominating clusters at day 0 (cluster 6 and 8) were high in AP-1 accessibility, cells in clus-ter 5, which was predominantly found at day 30, were low in AP-1 (Figures 4 G and 4H). Cells in cluster 3 exhibited intermediate AP-1 and CEBP accessibility ( Figure 4 G) and their relative abundance was stable throughout vaccination ( Figure 4 E). Using Hotspot ( De- Tomaso and Yosef, 2020 ), we determined a of genomic re- gions underlying the observed heterogeneity ( Figure 4 I). This set was enriched for regions associated with the production of proin- flammatory cytokines and TLR signaling ( Figure 4 J), and included regions associated with the AP-1 members FOS and JUN, multi-ple MAP kinases, and NFKB. Importantly, cells with high AP-1accessibility using the motif-based chromVAR analysis also dis- played high accessibility at the regions coding for inflammatory genes ( Figures 4 H and 4I). Finally, using the scRNA-seq dataset, we determined the cellular heterogeneity at the transcriptional level. Although genes in the Hotspot module varied in their expres- sion between single classical monocytes, this heterogeneity wasless distinct compared to the epigenomic landscape ( Figure 4 K). AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 influenza reduced chromatin accessibility of AP-1 loci in myeloid cells The effects the inactivated stimulation bymyeloid cells, was unexpected and seemingly at odds with prior work on the live attenuated BCG vaccine showing enhanced and persistent innate responses to vaccination, termed ''trained im- munity'' ( Arts et al., 2018 ). This raised the possibility that the live BCG vaccine delivered potent adjuvant signals that stimu- lated persistent epigenomic changes in myeloid cells, whereas the seasonal influenza vaccine, devoid of an adjuvant, was un-able to stimulate trained immunity and instead induced a formof trained tolerance. We hypothesized that the addition of an adjuvant to an inactivated influenza vaccine would induce enhanced and persistent innate responses. We used AS03, asqualene-based adjuvant containing alpha-tocopherol that in- duces strong innate and adaptive immune responses ( Pulendran et al., 2021 ) and is included in the licensed H5N1 avian influenza vaccine ( Garc\u00b8 on et al., 2012 ;Khurana et al., 2018 ) and is being developed for COVID-19 vaccines ( Arunachalam et al., 2021 ; Goepfert et al., 2021 et al., 2020 ). We investigated the ef- fect of AS03 on the epigenomic immune cell landscape in acohort of healthy individuals that were vaccinated with an inacti- vated split-virion vaccine against H5N1 influenza administered with or without AS03 ( Figure 5 A). The vaccine was administered in a prime-boost regimen and individuals received injections at day 0 and day 21. First, we determined whether AS03 affected the vaccine- induced chromatin mark changes observed after vaccination with TIV. Using EpiTOF, we analyzed PBMC samples from 18 vaccinated subjects (9 H5N1, 9 H5N1+AS03) at day 0, 7, 21,28, and 42 and constructed the histone modication prole histone modication proles at day 0 with day 42, we, unexpectedly, observed thatvaccination with H5N1+AS03 induced a signicant reduction inH3K27ac, H4K5ac, H3K9ac, and PADI4 in classical monocytes, four of the ve highly correlated marks associated with myeloid reprogramming after TIV ( Figure 5 C). In contrast, vaccination with H5N1 alone did not induce signicant changes in these chromatin marks. In line with these ndings, we also observed in the H5N1+AS03 group but not the H5N1 group signicantlyreduced production of most of the innate cytokines and chemo- kines that were diminished after vaccination with TIV ( Figure 5 D). Notably, we did not detect a change in the frequency or viabilityof classical monocytes and all detected cytokines were stronglyinduced by TLR stimulation ( Figures S6 A and S6B). we analyzed subjects using scATAC-seq and scRNA- seq. PBMC samples from 4 vaccinated individuals (2 H5N1, 2H5N1+AS03) at days 0, 21, and 42 were enriched for DC subsets Figure 5.

In parallel, we used the scRNA-seq data to construct a gene-expression map of the single immune cell landscape. Weretained 11,213 high-quality transcriptomes with an average of 2,462 genes and 9,569 unique transcripts detected per cell and identied all major innate immune cell subsets ( Figure 5 E; Data S5 ). The different immune cell subsets were evenly distrib- uted over all vaccine conditions and time points ( Data S5 ). Notably, using the scATAC-seq data, we observed a signi- cant reduction in AP-1 accessibility in H5N1+AS03 but not H5N1 alone ( Figure 5 F). To further investigate the nature of the epigenomic changes after H5N1+AS03, we determined differen-tially accessible regions at day 42 after vaccination compared today 0 using a logistic regression model that corrects for library- size differences. Using overrepresentation analysis, we found that similar to TIV, the predominantly negative DARs were en-riched for TLR-, and cytokine-signaling pathways as well as innate immune activity ( Figure 5 G). Additionally, we observed a reduction in the expression of multiple AP-1 family members,including c-Fos and c-Jun as observed after vaccination with TIV ( Figure 5 H). AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 influenza vaccine induces enhanced chromatin accessibility of the antiviral response lociDespite the reduction in AP-1 accessibility, our scATAC-seqanalysis revealed an increase in chromatin accessibility at day 42 compared to day 0 for several TFs of the interferon-response factor (IRF) and STAT families ( Figure 6 A). These changes were observed in innate immune cell populations of subjects vacci- nated with H5N1+AS03, but not with H5N1 alone. Further anal- ysis of the kinetics revealed that these IRF- and STAT-relatedchanges were already present after administration of the rstvaccination at day 21 (pre-boost) ( Figure 6 B). Using the scRNA-seq dataset, we compared the expression of IRF and STAT family TFs before (day 0) and after prime (day 21) or boost (day 42) vaccination. We observed signicant increases in theexpression of IRF1 and STAT1 in multiple innate immune cell subsets after vaccination with H5N1+AS03 but not with H5N1 alone ( Figure 6 C). Notably, at a single-cell level, IRF was generally negatively correlated with ( Fig- ure 6 D), especially in dendritic cells. Next, we determined the log fold change in chromatin accessibility for peaks containing the IRF1 binding motif ( Figure 6 E). Indeed, we observed a signicant change in accessibility in many peaks, many of which showed increased accessibility ( Figure 6 E). Importantly, among the genes with increased accessibility, we identied many interferon(IFN)- and antiviral-related genes, including DDX58 (encoding the viral detector several interferon response genes (IFIT1, IFIT3, IFI30, well and IRF8. Enrichment analysis further demon-strated an enrichment of genes related to antiviral immunity (Figure 6 F). In contrast to this H5N1+AS03-induced effect, vacci- nation with TIV induced only a transient type I IFN response ( Fig- ure S7 A) and only a transient increase in IRF and STAT accessi- bility at day 1 after vaccination ( Figure S7 B). At day 30 after vaccination with TIV, the majority of signicantly changed peakswith an IRF motif in fact showed reduced chromatin accessibility (Figure S7 C) and scRNA-seq gene-expression analysis showed no change in IRF and STAT TF gene expression at day 30 ( Fig- ure S7 D). This is in line with the ndings from bulk ATAC-seq where we observed an enrichment of IFN response pathway genes in DARs with reduced accessibility but not in those withenhanced accessibility ( Figure S7 E). Together, this indicates that, only vaccination with H5N1+AS03, but not H5N1 alone or TIV, leads to an overall enhanced accessibility of the antiviral response loci. IRF1, together with STAT1 and IRF8, orchestratesmonocyte polarization in response to interferon gamma expo- sure ( Langlais et al., 2016 ); IFN signaling, via JAK/TYK, to phosphorylation of IRF and STAT TFs ( Tamura et al., 2008 ). Indeed, we observed an increase in IFN gamma levels in plasma Figure 6.

The levels of IP10, a cytokine that is produced by monocytes in response to IFN signaling, were also elevated ( Figure 6 G). This raises the possibility that IFN signaling could have induced the increased IRF accessibility. Next, we determined whether the observed epigenomic changes were translated to changes in gene expression in restingmonocytes. We assessed the relationship between the change in accessibility for signicantly changed peaks carrying the IRF1 motifs and the change in gene expression for the same gene ( Fig- ure 6 H). Notably, we detected a weak association between changes in accessibility and gene expression (Pearson correla- tion R = 0.082, p = 0.017, chi-square p = 0.62) indicating thatthe increased accessibility has limited impact on homeostatic gene expression in these cells. Instead, we hypothesized that the changes in chromatin accessibility enhance the inducedresponse to viral stimuli in activated cells. To test this hypothesis,we analyzed bulk RNA-seq data from 50 (16 H5N1, 34 H5N1+AS03) vaccinated subjects at time points before and after the prime (days 0, 1, 3, and 7) and booster (days 21, 22, 24, and28) vaccination. As expected, antiviral- and interferon-related genes were upregulated at day 1 after each vaccination, espe- cially in the group that received H5N1+AS03 ( Figure 6 I). Impor- tantly, subjects receiving a H5N1+AS03 booster vaccination (day 22 versus day 21) displayed even higher levels of antiviral gene expression compared with the response to the prime vac-cine (day 1 versus day 0) ( Figure 6 I). The booster vaccine was given at a time when the chromatin accessibility landscape of the innate immune system was altered suggesting that theincreased accessibility in IRF loci might enable the enhancedresponse to the booster vaccine. To further test this hypothesis, we compared the increase in gene expression of antiviral- and interferon-related genes during booster compared to primewith the change in chromatin accessibility at day 21 compared to day 0 ( Figure 6 J). Indeed, we observed a signicant associa- tion between both variables (chi-square p = 0.01), and mostgenes with increased expression after booster vaccination also showed increased chromatin accessibility at the time the booster vaccine was administered. Genes with increased accessibilityand enhanced expression were enriched for IRF1 transcriptionfactor target genes ( Figure 6 K). This is in line with the elevated levels of IP-10 and IFN gamma observed in plasma of individuals after booster compared to prime vaccination ( Figure 6 G). To determine whether the observed epigenomic changes re- sulted in enhanced resistance to viral infections, we infected PBMCs at days 0, 21, and 42 with Dengue or Zika virus ( Fig- ure 7 A). Previous studies have shown that the primary targets of these viruses in PBMCs are monocytes and dendritic cells (Kou et al., 2008 ;Michlmayr et al., 2017 ). After infection, we cultured cells for 0, 24, and 48 h and determined the viral copy number using qPCR ( Figure 7 B). We observed increasednumbers of Zika and Dengue virus copies at 24 h and reduction at 48 h following the expected cycle of infection, replication, and eventual death of the host cells ( Figure 7 C). Next, we compared the viral titers at day 21 and 42 after vaccination with the pre-vaccination titers at day 0 for each subject. Strikingly, we observed a signicant reduction in viral titers for both Dengue and Zika virus at day 21 after vaccination ( Figure 7 D). Impor- tantly, in many subjects, we observed reduced viral titers aslate as 42 days after initial vaccination ( Figure 7 D). Next, we determined the cytokine concentration in infected PBMC cul- tures at 24 h after infection ( Figure 7 E). While Dengue and Zika virus induced the production of both IFNa and IFNg, we observed that Dengue virus suppressed the production of IP10 (Figure 7 E). Finally, we correlated the change in viral titers at d0 compared to d21 with the change in vaccine-induced expres- sion of antiviral genes that were associated with open chromatin (Figure 6 J, red quadrant). The majority of these genes correlated negatively with viral titers ( Figure 7 F). Strikingly, IRF1 was among the top genes negatively correlating (r < /C00.8) with both Dengue and Zika titers Figure 7 F). Subjects with enhanced IRF1 expres- sion at day 21 showed reduced viral titers at the same time point (Figure 7 G). In addition, the antiviral gene ANKRD22, which is involved in immunity to both Dengue and Chikungunya infection (Soares-Schanoski et al., 2019 ), was highly negatively correlated with Zika and Dengue titers. DISCUSSIONOur results demonstrate that seasonal TIV and the adjuvanted pre-pandemic influenza vac-cine (H5N1+AS03) induce profound and persistent global epige-nomic changes in blood myeloid cells, and that these epige- nomic changes are linked to alterations in their function. The observed changes were most pronounced at 3-4 weeks aftervaccination, but traces of an altered epigenomic landscape were still detectable as late as 180 days after vaccination. In contrast to vaccination, antibiotics treatment only had a transientand subtle impact on the epigenomic immune cell landscape. Based on their molecular and functional characteristics, the observed epigenomic changes can be broadly classied intotwo distinct types: (1) a state of innate immune refractoriness that is characterized by reduced histone acetylation, reduced PADI4 levels, reduced AP-1 accessibility, and diminished produc-tion of innate cytokines; (2) a state of heightened antiviral vigilancedened by increased IRF accessibility, elevated antiviral gene expression, increased interferon production, and, most impor- tantly, enhanced control of heterologous viral infections. Impor-tantly, both states can occur simultaneously and in the same single cell. While seemingly paradoxical, this superimposition might represent an evolutionary adaptation to avoid excess inflamma-tory host damage during late stages of infections, while maintain- ing a state of immunological vigilance against viral infections.

In contrast, our results suggest that vaccine-induced epige- nomic reprogramming of immune cells is more complex. Given the observed reduction in H3K27ac levels in association withimmune refractoriness in this study, the possibility arises thathistone acetylation could represent a bi-directional regulator, powered by epigenomically distinct states at the single-cell level, that can be raised or lowered to manipulate monocyte cytokineproduction accordingly, akin to a thermostat dial ( Figure 7 H). In addition, our data demonstrate that multiple distinct epigenomic states, such as antiviral vigilance and immune refractoriness,can be superimposed within the same cell. Importantly, this su- perimposition is encoded at the single-cell level as single mono- cytes and dendritic cells displayed elevated IRF and diminishedAP-1 accessibility at the same time. Single-cell analysis further revealed multiple clusters within the classic monocyte population based on differences in chro- matin accessibility. Notably, all these epigenomic subclustersexisted before vaccination and their abundance within the pool of circulating cells shifted post-vaccination driving the observed bulk level changes. The transcription factor families underlyingthe observed heterogeneity, AP-1 and CEBP, were previously 2018 ), respectively. AP-1 signaling is also a central regulator of inflammation ( Van der Bruggen et al., 1999 ;Das et al., 2009 ;Fontana et al., 2015 ;Fu- jioka et al., 2004 ;Hannemann et al., 2017 ;Ventura et al., 2003 ), and our Hotspot analysis revealed differences in accessi- bility at inflammatory loci between epigenomic subclusters. This might suggest that distinct functional and ontogenetic fatescould be imprinted within the epigenome of single monocytes. Indeed, it was recently hypothesized that classical monocytes could represent a heterologous population of cells, some pre-committed to tissue inltration and macrophage differentiation and others primed for differentiation into non-classical mono- cytes ( Guilliams et al., 2018 ). relevance of these epigenomically distinct subsets of myeloid cells, and their devel-opmental relationships deserve further exploration. With respect to the molecular mechanisms driving the epi- genomic changes, we observed that the state of antiviral vigi-lance was associated with enhanced IRF1 and STAT1 activity and enhanced accessibility of many, but not all, loci targeted by IRF. It is established that IRF and STAT signaling promotesantiviral immunity ( Tamura et al., 2008 ) and KO models lacking IRF1 or STAT1 are more susceptible to viral infection ( Meraz et al., 1996 ;Panda et al., 2019 ). In contrast, the state of im- mune refractoriness was associated with a global acetylation and chromatin accessibility. The magni- tude of the observed changes suggests a comprehensiveswitch toward a broadly restrictive chromatin state ( Allis and analysis that AP-1 loci are affected by this process. AP-1 is a dimeric TF composed of different members of the FOS, JUN, ATF, andJDP families, and our gene-expression analysis suggeststhat multiple members including FOS, JUN, JUNB, and ATF3 are involved. While the role of AP-1 as a key regulator of differ- entiation, inflammation, and polarization in myeloid cells is well described ( Behre et al., 1999 ;Van der Bruggen et al., 1999 ; Das et al., 2009 ;Fontana et al., 2015 ;Fujioka et al., 2004 ;Han- nemann et al., 2017 ;Monick et al., 1999 ;Phanstiel et al., 2017 ; Tsai et al., 2000 ;Ventura et al., 2003 ), recent research also po- sitions it as a central epigenomic regulator ( Arias et al., 1994 ; Beisaw et al., 2020 ;Biddie et al., 2011 ;Phanstiel et al., 2017 ;Zanger et al., 2001 ). A fundamental question concerns the mechanisms by which vaccination induces such long-lasting epigenetic changes in myeloid cells. The half-lives of most DC and monocyte subsets are known to be only a few days ( van Furth and Cohn, 1968 ;Ka- math et al., 2000 ). Therefore, it is unclear how epigenetic changes acquired by a DC or monocyte responding to a vaccine might be maintained for several weeks or months. Multiple ex-planations are conceivable: for instance, the phenomenon ofinnate memory could simply be caused by the effects of an ongoing adaptive immune response on innate immune cells (via paracrine signaling of cytokines such as interferon-gamma),rather than being an intrinsic property of innate immune cells. Furthermore, innate memory could be maintained by some long-lived population of innate immune cells, like memory Tand B cells, and such cells could respond with enhanced vigor to a secondary vaccination or infection. Finally, it is possible that epigenetically reprogrammed myeloid cells in the peripheryare continually replenished by altered myeloid cell precursors in the bone marrow ( Cirovic et al., 2020 ;Kaufmann et al., 2018 ;Mi- troulis et al., 2018 ). In the context of our results, it might be possible that soluble mediators related to the vaccine response,such as interferons, could act on progenitor cells in the bone marrow ( Boettcher and Manz, 2017 ). Our results from the H5N1+AS03 vaccine revealed that PBMCs from vaccinated individuals control infection with the heterologous Dengue and Zika virus more efciently than pre- vaccination PBMCs. These results, in combination with theenhanced expression of antiviral genes and increased levels of IP-10 and IFN gamma production in vivo , suggest that the epigenomic state of antiviral vigilance might provide broad pro-tection against viral infections unrelated to the vaccine virus.Elevated levels of IFN gamma production at day 1 after booster vaccination were also detected with AS03-adjuvanted vaccines in the context of Hepatitis ( Burny et al., 2017 ) suggesting that antiviral vigilance might also be induced by other vaccines containing AS03. In contrast, TIV induced a profound state of immune refractoriness at four weeks after vaccination. Never-theless, it is important to highlight that there is ample evidence that TIV does prevent influenza ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020 ), and our own study found induction of robust anti-influenza titers ( Hagan et al., 2019 ). Addi- tionally, the severity of many viral infections, including influenza and COVID-19, is closely linked to the level of inflammation-related immunopathology. Therefore, it is tempting to speculatethat in addition to stimulating robust antigen-specic antibody responses, TIV vaccination could also promote disease toler- ance that could conceivably help ameliorate the immunopa-thology caused by excessive inflammation in severe diseasell 3930 Cell184, 3915-3935, July 22, 2021Articlecaused by influenza. Taken together, these results suggest that it could be benecial to administer TIV together with an adju- vant, such as AS03. This adjuvanted TIV would benecial effects of both epigenomics-driven states observedhere: IRF-driven antiviral vigilance, and AP-1 driven immune refractoriness and disease tolerance. Indeed, a phase 3 clinical trial comparing the response to TIV versus TIV+AS03 in morethan 43,000 elderly individuals demonstrated that TIV+AS03led to a profound reduction in all-cause death and pneumonia compared to TIV alone, while influenza-specic immunity was only somewhat increased ( McElhaney et al., 2013 ). In conclusion, our results demonstrate that vaccination with AS03-adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine induces persis- tent epigenomic changes in myeloid cells, leading to an antiviralstate and protection against heterologous viruses. These nd- ings have implications for the design of future vaccines consist- ing of epigenetic adjuvants that provide broad, non-specicprotection by manipulating the epigenomic landscape. Limitations of study Two key areas deserve further exploration: (1) the mechanism(s)by which such persistent epigenomic changes occur in myeloid cells, and (2) the functional consequence of this epigenomic re- programming in mediating antiviral protection against heterolo-gous virus infections in vivo remain unknown. Future studies in animal models and, controlled human challenge model studies, can help address these important issues.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS TIV The study design was as described in phase 1 of the original publication ( Hagan et al., 2019 ) and the study was conducted in Atlanta, GA. In brief, during the 2014-2015 seasons, we enrolled a total of 21 healthy adults who were randomized into antibiotics-treated (n = 10) and control (n = 11) groups. Subjects were males and non-pregnant females between the ages of 18-40 who met the eligibilityContinued Reagent or resource https://code.google.com/archive/p/ rna-star/ FlowJo FlowJo https://www.flowjo.com/ R framework for 2008 et et al., 2019 https://github.com/YosefLab/VISION RNA-seq scripts This paper DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.4446316 UMAP McInnes et al., 2020 https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap OtherEpiTOF - and analyzed data This paper https://khatrilab.stanford.edu/epitof/ll e5 Cell184, 3915-3935.e1-e12, July 22, 2021Articlecriteria as listed on Subject demographics are listed in ( Data S1 , related to STAR Methods ). The antibiotics treatment consisted of a cocktail of neomycin, vancomycin, and metronidazole, all given orally, for ve days. Antibiotic treatment started 3 days before the day of vaccination and continued until one day after for the antibiotics-treated group. All the study participants were vaccinated with Sano Pasteur's TIV vaccine, Fluzone, for the 2014-2015 season (Data S1 , related to STAR Methods ). Written informed consent was obtained from each subject and protocols were approved by Institutional Review Boards of Emory University. H5N1/H5N1+AS03 This study was conducted in Atlanta, GA. Subjects were males and non-pregnant females who met the eligibility criteria as listed on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01910519). We enrolled a total of 50 healthy adults who were randomized into two groups receiving either the adjuvanted (H5N1+AS03, n = 34) or unadjuvanted (H5N1, n = 16) GSK avian influenza vaccine. While both vaccines contained split-virion (A/Indonesia/5/2005) inactivated hemagglutinin antigen, the adjuvanted vaccine additionally AS03 adjuvant sys- tem (containing DL-alpha-tocopherol and squalene in an oil-in-water emulsion). Subject demographics are in ( Data S1 , related toSTAR Methods ). Written informed consent was obtained from each subject and protocols were approved by Institutional Review Boards of Emory University. In-vitro stimulation and intracellular flow cytometry experiments Samples from healthy subjects were collected at Stanford Blood Center or derived from the before-vaccination time point of a pre-vious vaccination trial ( Nakaya et al., 2015 ). All subjects provided a condential medical history card and completed informed consent to donate blood for clinical or research uses. We exclude subjects with known diseases, including but not limited to HIV, and hepatitis infections. Purication of buffy coat or LRS chamber from whole blood was performed at Stanford Blood Center to enrich for leuko-cytes prior to PBMC isolation. From the vaccination trial ( Nakaya et al., 2015 ), only samples from subjects aged 26 - 41 were selected for this paper. Samples were only selected from the before vaccination time point at day 0. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject with institutional review and approval from the Emory University Institutional Review Board. METHOD DETAILS Cells, plasma, and RNA isolation Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma were isolated from fresh blood (CPTs; Vacutainer with Sodium Citrate; BD), following the manufacturer's protocol. For samples from Stanford Blood Center, PBMCs isolated from whole blood, buffy coat or LRSchamber by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque PLUS #17-1440-02). PBMCs were frozen inDMSO with 10% FBS and stored at -80C and then transferred on the next day to liquid nitrogen freezers (-196C). Plasma samples from CPTs were stored at -80C. Trizol (Invitrogen) was used to fresh PBMCs (1 mL of Trizol to /C241.5x10 ^6 cells) and to protect RNA from degradation. Trizol samples were stored at -80C. Mass cytometry sample processing, staining, barcoding and data 10% FBS (ATCC) for 1 hour prior to processing. Cisplatin (ENZO Life Sciences) was added to 10 mM nal concentration for viability staining for 5 minutes before quenching with CyTOF Buffer 0.05% sodium azide). Cells were centrifuged at 400 g for 8 minutes and stained with lanthanide-labeled antibodies ( Data S2 , related to STAR Methods ) against immunophenotypic markers in CyTOF buffer containing Fc receptor blocker (BioLegend) for 30 minutes at room temperature (RT).Following extracellular marker staining, cells were washed 3 times with CyTOF buffer and xed in 1.6% PFA (Electron Microscopy Sciences) at 1x10 6cells/ml for 15 minutes at RT. Cells were centrifuged at 600 g for 5 minutes post-xation and permeabilized with 1 mL ice-cold methanol (Fisher Scientic) for 20 minutes at 4/C14C. 4 mL of CyTOF buffer was added to stop permeabilization followed by 2 PBS washes. Mass-tag sample barcoding was performed following the manufacturer's protocol (Fluidigm). Individual samples were then combined and stained with intracellular antibodies in CyTOF buffer containing Fc receptor blocker (BioLegend) overnight at 4/C14C. The following day, cells were washed twice in CyTOF buffer and stained with 250 nM 191/193Ir DNA intercalator (Fluidigm) in PBS with 1.6% PFA for 30 minutes at RT. Cells were washed twice with CyTOF buffer and once with double-deionized water (ddH2O) (ThermoFisher) followed by ltering through 35 mm strainer to remove aggregates. Cells were resuspended in ddH2O containing four element calibration beads (Fluidigm) and analyzed on CyTOF2 (Fluidigm).

After a total of 8h of incubation, cells were washed twice with 150 mL PBS (GE Life Sciences, SH30256.LS) and stained for viability using 100 mL of Zombie UV Fixable Viability Dye in PBS (1:1000; Biolegend, 423108). After incubating for 30 minutes at 4C in the dark, cells were washed twice with 150 mL PBS and blocked with 100 mL of PBS supplemented with 5% FBS, EDTA (2 mM; Sigma Aldrich, G4386-5G) [blockingbuffer] for 15 minutes at 4C in the dark. After incubation, cells were stained for surface markers with 100 mL of antibody cocktail for 20 minutes at 4C in the dark. Next, cells were washed twice with 150 mL PBS, and xed in 200 mL eBioscience Foxp3 Fixation/Permeabilization solution (ThermoFisher Scientic, 00-5523-00) for 30 minutes at 4C in the dark. Afterward, cells were washed twice with 100 mL eBioscience Foxp3 permeabilization buffer and blocked with 100 mL per- meabilization buffer containing human IgG (5 mg/mL) overnight at 4C in the dark. Cells were washed and stained for intracellularmarkers with 25 mL of antibody cocktail containing IgG (5 mg/mL) for 60 minutes at 4C in the dark. Finally, cells were washed twice with 150 mL of permeabilization buffer, resuspended in 100 mL PBS containing 0.5% FBS and 2 mM EDTA [FACS buffer], and acquired using a BD FACSymphony flow cytometer. Data was analyzed discarded via SSC-A/SSC-H and FSC-A/FSC-H gates, and dead cells were discarded as Zombie UV Fixable Viability Dye high. Monocytes were then identied FACS sorting - ATAC-seq/RNA-seq Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed, washed, counted, and resuspended in PBS (GE Life Sciences, SH30256.LS). 5-10x10 ^6 cells were washed once more with 2 mL of PBS and stained for viability using 500 mL of Zombie UV Fixable Viability Dye in PBS (1:1000; Biolegend, 423108). After incubating for 30 minutes at 4C in the dark, cells were washed with 2 mL of PBS and resuspended in 500 mL blocking buffer. After spinning cells down, supernatant was discarded, and cells were resuspended in 50 mL buffer. Cells were stained for 15 minutes at 4C in the dark. Finally, cells were washed with 2 mL of FACS buffer, resuspended in PBS containing 5% FBS at10-20x10 ^6 on a FACS Aria Fusion (BD). During sort, live innate cells were identied by gating on Viability Dye -CD3-CD19-CD20-cells. Within this population, were as Omni of puried immune cells Atac was performed on puried innate immune cell subsets immediately after sorting based on the low-input Omni-Atac protocoldescribed before ( Corces et al., 2017 ). In brief, 1,500 - 5,500 cells were washed with ATAC resuspension buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 supernatant rst using a P1000, then a P200 pipette. Next, mL transposition 10% Tween-20, 0.1 mL 1% Digitonin, 3.3 mL PBS, 1 mL water, and 5 mL tagmentation buffer) was added to the pellet and cells were resuspended by pipetting up and down 6 times. Tagmentation buffer was prepared locally by resuspending 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl 2, and 20% Dimethyl Formamide (Sigma Aldrich, D4551-250ML) in water. Cells were incubated at 37C for 30 minutes under constant mixing. After tagmentation, the reaction was cleaned up using the MinElute PCR Purication Kit(QIAGEN, 28006) according to manufacturer's instructions. Cleaned DNA was eluted in 21 mL of elution buffer, stored at /C020C, and shipped to Active Motif for sequencing library preparation. At Active Motif, tagmented DNA was amplied with 10 cycles of PCR using customized Nextera PCR Primers 1 and 2 (see using Agencourt AMPure SPRI Quantication Kit for Illumina platforms 07960255001), RNA-seq RNA-seq was performed on puried CD14 +monocytes after sorting. In brief, after sorting, 5,500 cells were washed, resus- pended in 350 mL chilled 1 minute, and immediately frozen at /C080C. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Micro kit (QIAGEN, 74004) with on-column DNase digestion. RNA quality was assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer and total RNA was used as input for cDNA synthesis using the Clontech SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA kit (Takara Bio, 634894) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Amplied cDNA was fragmented and appended with dual-indexed bar codes using the NexteraXT DNA Library Preparation kit (Illumina,FC-131-1096). Libraries were validated by capillary electrophoresis on an TapeStation, per sample. FACS sorting - scATAC-seq/RNA-seq Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed, and innate immune cell subsets were isolated using FACS as described above (''FACS sorting - bulk ATAC-seq/RNA-seq''). Prior to FACS, monocytes and dendritic cells Mouse IgG (Invitrogen, 11041) were identied as CD14 +(fraction A) while a mixture of the remaining monocyte and dendritic cell subsets was identied as CD14-CD56-HLA-DR+(fraction B). After sorting and depending on the number of isolated cells, fraction A and B were mixed at a 2:1 ratio to yield a solution of monocytes and dendritic cells enriched for CD14-cells. scRNA-seq and 0.5 U/ mL RNase Inhibitor (Sigma Aldrich). About 9,000 cells were targeted for each experiment. Cells were mixed with the reverse transcription mix and subjected to partition-ing along with the Chromium gel-beads using the 10X Chromium system to generate the Gel-Bead in Emulsions (GEMs) using the 3 0 V3 chemistry (10X Genomics). The RT reaction was conducted in the C1000 touch PCR instrument (BioRad). Barcoded cDNA was extracted from the GEMs Post-GEM RT-cleanup and amplied for 12 cycles. Amplied A and 10X specic sample using Bioanalyzerll Cell184, 3915-3935.e1-e12, July 22, 2021 e8Article(Agilent) analysis. Libraries were pooled and sequenced on an NovaSeq 6000 instrument (Illumina) using the recommended sequencing read lengths of 28 bp (Read 1), 8 bp (i7 Index Read), and 91 bp (Read 2). scATAC-seq FACS-puried cells were processed for single nuclei ATAC-seq according to the manufacturer's instructions (10x Genomics, CG000168 Rev D). Briefly, nuclei were obtained by incubating PBMCs for 3.20 minutes in freshly prepared Lysis buffer following man- ufacturer's instructions for Low Cell Input Nuclei Isolation (10x Genomics, CG000169 Rev C). Nuclei were washed and resuspended inchilled diluted nuclei buffer (10x Genomics, 2000153). Next, nuclei were subjected to transposition at 37C on the C1000 touchPCR instrument (BioRad) prior to single nucleus capture on the 10x Chromium instrument. Samples were subjected to post GEM cleanup, sample index PCR, cleanup, and library QC prior to sequencing according to the protocol. Samples were pooled, quantied, and sequenced on NovaSeq 6000 instrument (Illumina) with at least minimum recommended read depth (25000 read pairs/nucleus). Detection of IFNa and IFNg in plasma and cell culture supernatants Frozen plasma or supernatant was thawed at room temperature and analyzed using the IFNa and IFNg Human ProQuantum Immu-noassay Kits according to manufacturer's instructions. In brief, samples were mixed with assay dilution buffer at a 1:5 or 1:2 ratio and protein standard was serially diluted in assay dilution buffer. Next, Antibody-conjugates A and B were mixed with Antibody-conjugate dilution buffer and added to each well of a 96-well qPCR plate (Bio-Rad, #HSP9601). Next, diluted sample or standard were added toeach well and mixtures were incubated for 1h at room temperature in the dark. Finally, Master mix and Ligase were mixed and addedto each well. QPCR was conducted on a CFX96 Touch Real-Time Detection System (Biorad) using the recommended instrument settings. After measurements were completed, CT values were calculated using a regression model and exported to the ProQuantum Cloud app that accompanied the kit ( https://apps.thermosher.com/apps/proquantum ). ProQuantum Cloud app was then used to construct a standard curve and calculate protein concentrations from CT values. IP-10 plasma Luminex Plasma biomarker levels according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol and read using a Bio-Plex 200 suspension array reader (Bio-Rad). Data were analyzed using Bio-Plex manager software (Bio-Rad). Viral infection assay Dengue virus (DENV- 2, Strain Thailand/16681/84) Zika virus were propagated and titrated on Vero cells and storedat/C080C until infection. Cryopreserved human PBMCs were thawed, washed, counted, and resuspended cell solution (3x10 ^5 cells) was added to each well of a 96-well round-bottomed tissue culture plate and cells were rested in plates for 4h at 37C and 5% CO 2. After resting, PBMCs were infected with DENV-2 or ZIKV at MOI 1. At 0h, 24h, 48h post infection, PBMCs and supernatant were RNA purication and cyto- kine analysis, respectively. Supernatants were immediately frozen at /C020C and stored until analysis. Cells were suspended in RNA lysis buffer and kept at /C020C until analysis. RNA was puried using the Purelink RNA kit according to manufacturer recommendations (Thermo Fisher Scientic, #12183052). For viral load detection, quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted using Luna universal probe one-step RT-PCR kit (NEB, #E3006) on a CFX96 C1000 Detection System with #HSP9601). RNA standards (ATCC, # VR-3229SD, VR-1843DQ) were used to generate standard curves. ViralRNA copies were normalized by cell number. Utilized primers and probes are listed in the key resources table . Detection of IP-10 in culture supernatant Culture supernatants were thawed at room temperature and analyzed using the IP-10 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&DSystems, DIP100) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, samples were thawed at room temperature and mixed with assay dilution buffer at 1:2 ratio. Protein standard was serially diluted in assay dilution buffer. Samples and standards were incu- bated in plate for 2h at room temperature. Plates were washed and then incubated with human IP-10 conjugate for 2h at room tem-perature. After wash, substrate solution was added for 30min. Finally, stop solution was added, A450 and A595 were read on a plate reader (Bio-Rad, iMARK). The concentration of IP-10 was determined by the number of A450-A595 based on the standard curve. QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Immune cell population denitions and EpiTOF data pre-processing Raw data were pre-processed using FlowJo (FlowJo, LLC) to identify cell events from individual samples by palladium-based masstags, and to segregate specic immune cell populations by immunophenotypic markers. A detailed gating hierarchy is described in Data S2 , related to STAR Methods (TIV & H5N1/H5N1+AS03). Single-cell data for various immune cell subtypes from individual sub- jects were 3915-3935.e1-e12, July 22, 2021ArticleEpiTOF analysis The exported Flowjo data were then normalized following the approach described in ( Cheung et al., 2018 ). In brief, the value of each histone mark was regressed against the total amount of histones, represented by measured values of H3 and H4. For sample level analyses, the values of each histone mark were averaged for each cell type in each sample. Distances of HSC from lymphoid andmyeloid epigenetic proles were obtained by rst computing centers of the epigenetic proles for the two lineages, and then computing Euclidean distances from the centers for each individual HSC. Distances of HSC from epigenetic proles of specic cell types were similarly obtained by computing Euclidean distances from the centers of the epigenetic proles for each cell type.Statistical signicance of the differences between groups at the sample level was assessed by computing an effect size with Hedges'g formula ( Hedges and Olkin, 2014 ). All p values were corrected for multiple comparisons with the Benjamini-Hochberg method (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995 ). Dimensionality reduction was performed with applying UMAP ( McInnes et al., 2020 ). For single cell analyses, the normalized values were used as input. Correlation between variables was computed using Pearson's correlationcoefcient. All the analyses were performed using the R framework for statistical computing (Version 3.6.3) ( R Core Team, 2020 ). TIV bulk gene-expression analysis Processed data was normalized in Bioconductor by RMA ( Irizarry et al., 2003 ), which includes global background adjustment and quantile normalization. Samples from phase1 subjects in the antibiotics and control arm of the study were selected and statistical tests and correlation analyses were performed using MATLAB. Test details and signicance cutoffs are reported in gure legends. Luminex analysis Statistical analysis was conducted in R (v 4.0.2) ( R Core Team, 2020 ). First, MFI data was log2 transformed and average MFI and CV was calculated from duplicate cultures where available. For samples with CV > 0.25, the duplicate that was closer to the average of allsamples of that subject was kept and the other discarded. In case no other sample was available and CV > 0.25, the sample was discarded. Wells without indication of cytokine production were excluded. Statistical tests, correlation analysis, and hierarchical clustering were performed using the R packages stats (v 4.0.2), ggpubr (v 0.4.0) and pheatmap (v 1.0.12). Test details and statisticalcutoffs are reported in the gure legends. Bulk ATAC-seq pre-processing Reads were aligned using the BWA algorithm (mem mode; default settings; v 0.7.12) (Li and Durbin, 2009 ). Duplicate reads were removed, only reads mapping as matched pairs and only uniquely mapped reads (mapping quality > = 1) were used for further anal- ysis. Alignments were extended in silico at their 3 0ends to a length of 200 bp and assigned to 32-nt bins along the genome. The were stored bigWig were identied using the MACS algorithm (v 2.1.0)(Zhang et al., 2008 ) at a cutoff of p value 1e-7, without control le, and with the -nomodel option. Peaks that were on the ENCODE blacklist of known false ChIP-Seq peaks were removed. Signal maps and peak locations were used as input data to Active Motif's proprietary analysis program. For differential analysis, reads were counted in all merged peak regions (using Subread), and the rep-licates for each condition were compared using DESeq2 (v 1.24.0) ( Love et al., 2014 ). Bulk ATAC-seq analysis Quality control analysis of ATAC-seq data was performed using Rockefeller University workshop on analysis of ATAC-seq data in R and Bioconductor ( https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/RU_ATAC_Workshop.html ). Of 57 unique samples processed, 51 passed QC criteria and, on average, we detected more than 42,000 genomic regions and more than 15x10 6unique ATAC tags per sample while the average fraction of reads in peaks was larger than 35% ( Data S3 , related to Figure 3 ). Passed samples showed the char- acteristic fragment length and TSS enrichment distribution ( Data S3 , related to Figure 3 ). DARs were annotated as promoter, distal and trans regulatory peak for a particular gene based on the distance from the middle of the peak to the nearest transcription start site (TSS) using the ChIPpeakAnno package in R (v. 3.24.1). Promoter, distal and trans regulatory peaks were dened as /C02000 bp to +500 bp, /C010kbp to +10kbp - promoter, and < /C010kbp or > +10kbp from TSS, respectively. The hypergeometric distribution- based enrichment analysis was performed to identify the signicance of the DARs. Reactome pathways and TF-target relationship using Chip-seq data from ENCODE (both downloaded from https://maayanlab.cloud/chea3/ ) were used to identify overrepresented Collection ) for CytoScape (v 3.8.2) ( Shannon et al., 2003 ) was used to create the pathway network. Signicantly enriched Reactome pathways (p %0.05) for each genomic region were used as input. Pathways were clustered and annotated using the AutoAnnotate function within the pipeline. To test for enrichmentof TF motifs in DARs, and packages were used in R (v 3.6.0) ( R Core Team, 2020 ). In brief, TF motifs were downloaded from the JASPAR2016 core Homo sapiens database ( Mathelier et al., 2016 ) and merged regions were annotated for the presence of all TF binding motifs using the matchMotifs (motifmatchr) function with standardsettings. Hypergeometric distribution-based enrichment analysis was then performed to identify enrichment of TF motifs in DARs. Todetermine the relationship between EpiTOF and ATAC-seq data, the Pearson correlation was computed between EpiTOF H3K27ac levels and normalized read counts in each merged peak region. Positively correlated merged peak regions with p value < = 0.05 were selected for functional annotation. Enrichment analysis was performed as described above.ll Cell184, 3915-3935.e1-e12, July 22, 2021 e10ArticleBulk RNA-seq of puried Alignment was performed using STAR version 2.7.3a ( Dobin et al., 2013 ) and transcripts were annotated using GRCh38 Ensembl release 100. Transcript abundance estimates were calculated internal to the STAR aligner using the algorithm of htseq-count 1.26.0 ( Love et al., 2014 ) was used for differential expression analysis using the Wald test with a paired design formula and using its standard library size normalization. Analysis of bulk transcriptomics data from previous TIV studies Processed bulk transcriptomics data from nine independent TIV studies conducted between 2007 and 2012 were et al., 2015 ;Nakaya et al., 2011 ,2015 ;Thakar et al., 2015 ;Tsang et al., 2014 ). After removing samples and genes with missing values as well as extraordinary vaccine time points, we selected only samples from subjects matching the same agerange as the current study: 18 - 45 years of age. The remaining samples were batch corrected using ComBat from the sva package in R (v 3.36.0) with study as batch, no covariates, and otherwise standard settings. Statistical tests were performed using the R base and ComplexHeatmap (v 2.4.3) packages. Test details and statistical cutoffs are reported in the gure legends. scATAC analysis The CellRanger-atac pipeline (v1.1.0) by for alignment (GRCh38 reference genome), de-duplication, and identication of cut sites for each sample. The samples were then combined using the CellRanger-atac aggregation pro-cedure without depth normalization (-normalize = none). The resulting fragment le was read into SnapATAC ( Fang et al., 2020 ). SnapATAC was used to bin the genome (bin size of 5K) and create a cell-by-bin count matrix. Cells were identied as barcodes with at latest 1000 UMIs, and a promotor ratio (dened as: (fragments in promoter regions + 1) / (total fragments +1)) of at least 0.1, resulting in a total of [state total number of cells in each experiment], as stated in the results section. Bins that mapped to chrY, mitochondrial DNA, or bins that overlap with ENCODE blacklist regions ( Amemiya et al., 2019 ), were removed. The remaining bins were used for dimensionality reduction using Truncated SVD with the irlba R package ( Baglama et al., 2019 ), and the rst 50 dimensions were then used for clustering. MACS2 ( Zhang et al., 2008 ) was then used to call peaks within each cluster using recommended parameters for ATACseq merged to a single combined set. SnapATAC was then used to map the fragments to the combinedpeaks set and create a peak-by-cell binary matrix. In the H5N1/H5N1+AS03 dataset, deeply-sequenced libraries were down- sampled to an average of 1500 fragments per barcode by randomly removing counts from these samples at a probability p = 1500/(mean fragments per cell in the sample). The dimensionality reduction and clustering procedure described abovewas then repeated on peak-by-cell matrix. ChromVAR ( Schep et al., 2017 ) parameters and the JAS- PAR2016 ( Mathelier et al., 2016 ) motif database to calculate motif accessibility scores and compute differentially accessible mo- tifs in the data. Hotspot was used to identify informative gene modules that explain heterogeneity within ), using the Bernoulli model and the top 2500 regions (ranked by highest autocorrelation z- score) for module calculation. Modules were then identied using the create_modules function, with min_gene_threshold = 200. Similar modules were manually identied and merged by taking the average score across modules. Differentially accessible regions were identied using logistic regression with the glm function in R with the design: y/C24time point +donor +log_frag- ments to control for donor and library size effects. The coefcient corresponding to the time point was then used as the logFC value, and a Wald test was used to get p values. For numerical stability, we only included peaks that were detected in at least 5% of the cells included in each comparison. All custom scripts for preprocessing, correlation analysis, and differential acces-sibility analysis are posted in zenodo [ https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4446316 ]. The hypergeometric distribution-based enrich- ment analysis was performed to identify the signicance of the DARs (p %0.05 and detected in at least 5% of cells). Reactome pathways database (both downloaded from overrepresented pathways. Enrichr ( Kuleshov et al., 2016 ) was used to conduct enrichment analysis of genomic regions within Hotspot modules 2, 3. Enrichr was also used to conduct enrichment analysis of DARs containing an IRF1 motif. Briefly, signicant DARs (p %0.05 and de- tected in at least 5% of cells) carrying an IRF1 motif, as determined by chromVAR, were selected. Next, gene names with mul- tiple associated DARs were collapsed in case all DARs changed in the same direction or otherwise discared. Subsequently,gene list was submitted to Enrichr for enrichment using the Reactome_2016 database. Similarly, we used Enrichr together with the ChEA_2016 databases to identify TF target genes enriched in genes that were enhanced after booster vaccination with H5N1+AS03 and that overlapped with changes in accessibility at promoter regions. scRNA analysis The CellRanger pipeline (v3.1.0) by 10X ltering. The ltered count aggregated using the CellRanger aggregation procedurewithout depth normalization (-normalize = none). The resulting count matrix was analyzed with scVI (scvi-tools v0.7.1) ( Lopez et al., 2018 ) with default hyperparameters to t a low-dimensional latent space, using the experiment annotation for each sample as a batch label for batch correction. Visualization, clustering, and exploratory analyses were performed with VISIONll e11 Cell184, July 22, 2021Article(v2.1.0) ( DeTomaso et al., 2019 ). Differential expression analysis between time points was performed with edgeR ( Robinson et al., 2010 ) as described in the package documentation, using the exactTest hypothesis testing for each pairwise analysis. Bulk transcriptomics vax010 Initial data quality was assessed by background level, 30labeling bias, and pairwise correlation among samples via the arrayQuality- Metrics package in Bioconductor ( Kauffmann et al., 2009 ). CEL les were normalized via RMA ( Irizarry et al., 2003 ), which includes global background adjustment and quantile normalization. Probes mapping to multiple genes were discarded, and the remainingprobes were collapsed to gene level by selecting the probe for each gene with the highest mean expression across all subjects. Sta-tistical tests were performed in MATLAB and R.
