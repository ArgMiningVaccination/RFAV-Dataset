Since the end of the last financial year, the world has changed dramatically. The inconceivable has happened: a war is being waged in Europe, with unforeseeable consequences. As I write these words, I can only hope that something has changed for the better in the weeks until you receive the report. And I hope that concerted attention will once again turn to how we, as the entire community of human beings, can tackle the existential threats facing our wonderful planet. At Wele- da, we will continue our work to address them together. \"One Health. One Beauty\" is the central theme of this year's report. 100 years ago, our founders developed a new understanding of health and beauty. Now we are building on this knowledge to create products offering solutions to the pressing challenges of our time. For more climate protection, more biodiversity and healthier soils. For the health of people and nature. We are convinced that growth can be sustainable. Read more about our approach on pages 14-15 and 20-21. In 2021, the entire Weleda Group became part of the movement of B Corporations - B Corp for short. Like other B Corps, we are using our business model to balance financial and ethical value creation in our work; maximising profits at all costs is not the focus. Find out what B Corp certification means for Weleda on pages 16-17. The pharmaceutical industry is facing major challenges. The urgent need to protect the Earth's water is just one reason why the pharmaceutical industry needs to better align with environmental and sustainability goals. Discover how Weleda wants to become even greener in the interview with Dr. Aldo Ammendola, Chief Research & Development Officer, on page 35. Each of us is the sum of the health and beauty of our body, soul and spirit. The health and beauty of human beings and the Earth are one. Holistic health only comes about when we live in peace with ourselves, our fellow human beings, and nature. Peace will only come when our political, economic and social systems are healthy - Weleda strives to help make this a reality. Warm regards, Thomas Jorberg President, Board of DirectorsEDITORIAL EXECUTIVE BOARD OF WELEDA AG Nataliya Yarmolenko Markets and Ammendola Research and Quality Alois Mayer OperationsMichael Brenner Finance, People, Sustainability \u00abWe know that we can only master the challenges of our time together.\u00bb ALOIS MAYER 9 Reserving the health and beauty of people and nature is rooted in our history. Doing business in harmony with our environment with a constant awareness of the consequences of growth is our mission. Weleda has been producing cos - metics and medicines for over 100 years. What drives us is our sense of respect and responsibility for people and nature. Our medicines activate the body's own ability to heal itself, and they help people become healthy and stay healthy in a natural way. Our natural and organic cosmetics care for the face, body and hair - so that our customers feel good in their skin. We strive not only to make people healthier but to protect the environment and preserve its beauty. Beauty is diversity: OUR MOTIVATION Weleda is committed to a healthy, diverse and beautiful world. Because only when nature is intact can human beings also be healthy. For 100 years, we have been using only natural ingredients and active substances in our cosmetic prod - ucts and medicines. All our products are 100 per cent biodegradable and free of microplastics, genetically modified raw materials and petroleum-based materi - als. From cultivation and harvesting to processing and delivery, our operations are as environmentally friendly and respectful as possible. We ensure that bio - diversity is preserved throughout our cultivation and supply chain and that resources are used sustainably. We work with suppliers and farmers on a long- term basis and help them secure their livelihoods. As a business enterprise, we want to use our growth to make a positive impact and continue to make business more sustainable and humane. To be fit OUR PROGRAMME FOR PEOPLE AND NATURE POne Health One Beauty10 11OUR PROGRAMME FOR PEOPLE AND NATURE ONE HEALTH. ONE BEAUTY. for the future, we must grow as a business, but not at any price - and certainly not at the expense of our environment. At Weleda, organic growth always occurs in dialogue with, and with the greatest respect for, the environment. We have already achieved a great deal. Since 2021, Weleda's energy con - sumption has been arithmetically climate-neutral. 80 per cent of the raw mate - rials in our products are sourced from certified organic cultivation, and 20 per cent are biodynamically cultivated. Around the world, we ourselves farm nearly 235 square kilometres according to organic standards - that's an area equiva - lent to almost 35,000 football fields, and an important contribution to protect - ing the climate, biodiversity and our soils. Weleda is the first natural cosmetics company to become a member of the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT) and bears its \"Sourcing with Respect\" label. This guarantees environmentally friendly and responsible raw material sourcing and supply chains in which all parties are treated with respect and paid fairly. Since 2021, B Corp certification confirms that Weleda is operating in a responsible and environmentally sustain - able way and adding value to society. Weleda promotes organic seed breeding and strengthens local organisations working for soil conservation. In addition, Weleda cultivates eight of its own gardens worldwide according to biodynamic principles and supports more than 50 sustainable and social cultivation pro - jects around the world. For a better, healthier, more beautiful world: OUR MISSION Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time - for every individual, but also for industry in particular. Not only are we aware of our responsibility, we also want to actively drive the change to a more sustainable and socially responsible way of doing business. For us, climate protection is not merely a matter of politics but an opportunity to continue developing innova - tive ideas for more sustainable consumption. We are open to new impulses and partner with like-minded people in other businesses and organisations. Among other things, we support the Soil Fertility Fund of the Swiss Organic Founda - tion. Because only together will we be able to take on all the challenges and truly make a difference. Our founding vision has stood the test of time. Today, our sustainable approach is more relevant than ever before. Protecting the health and beauty of nature is more important to us than making the greatest possible profit. That 12is why it is not enough for us to fulfil legal requirements. We want to make a significant contribution to a better, healthier, more beautiful world and be a role model for other companies. Our path forward continues into the future: in 2022, all Weleda products are to become arithmetically climate-neutral. To achieve this goal, we are using even more renewable energy and investing in more efficient production, climate protection measures in our agricultural supply chains, and offsetting measures. We continue to reduce our overall climate footprint by operating our buildings in a climate-neutral manner. Our new logistics centre in Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd, Germany, is being built from ecologically sustainable materials such as wood and clay. It will carry the DGNB Platinum certificate - the highest rating level issued by the German Sustainable Building Council. Weleda is developing envi- ronmentally friendly packaging made from organic materials; we will complete our switch to recycled materials by 2030. From 2022, we will invest one per cent of our sales in innovation and organisations for climate protection, biodi- versity and soil conservation. By 2025, we aim to operate a total of 60 sustain - able and socially responsible cultivation projects and continue to support cultivation projects around the world to create better working conditions. And we strive to increase the amount of biodynamic raw materials we use to 40 per cent by 2025. We further inspire and enthuse our customers through our publi - cations and social media channels for a sustainable lifestyle. We look back with pleasure on what we have achieved, but we do not rest on our laurels. We will continue to operate according to mission:: the health and beauty of people and nature are our top priority. ONE HEALTH. ONE BEAUTY. \u00abThe health and beauty of people and nature are our top priority.\u00bb 14 15ONE HEALTH. ONE BEAUTY. INTERVIEW Weleda not only celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2021 but also closed the year on an exceptional note. NY We have been certified as a B Corp since October 2021. To achieve this, we underwent a rigorous process evaluat- ing our corporate governance, employee rights and our im- pact on the environment and society. More than 100 people in the company were involved in the assessments. We were thrilled that we successfully passed this test at the end of our anniversary year. It is a strong signal of the company's environmental and social responsibility. What is behind the B Corp certification? MB B Corp certification is backed by an international move- ment comprising some 4,500 companies to date. Their work is meaningful, and their goal is to make a difference in the world. We underwent a very comprehensive and rigorous certification process. It is comparable to the Gemein- wohl\u00f6konomie (Economy for the Common Good) in Ger- man-speaking countries but goes even further. For in- stance, we had to change our article of purpose in the cor- porate bylaws. B Corp certification is granted only if the company's commitment to making a significantly positive impact on the common good and the environment through its business activities is anchored in its statutes. More and more companies seek a better balance be- tween people and nature, business and the environ- ment. To what extent are these values reflected in Weleda's history? NY Weleda has been guided by its company purpose for 100 years. We have always put our purpose above profit. In this sense, Weleda is a pioneer. So B Corp certification is the icing on the cake for us.MB Breaking even is not enough because we want to re- main independent. We want to be able to finance our tar- geted growth from our own resources - that also requires profit. We also want to generate enough profit to be able to use it for our purpose. One example of this is our 1% pro- gramme. NY In terms of cosmetics - and we see the growing trend for sustainable natural and organic cosmetics - we con- tinue to pursue our growth strategy. I want to mention this because we often hear the question: How can a growth strategy be compatible with purpose and sustain- ability? The way we have answered this question for our- selves is that we do not want to grow for the sake of growth but to achieve relevance and impact. The more people buy sustainable products, the better it is for the environment. Furthermore, we are promoting awareness of the connection between people and nature. Because it is only if nature and the Earth are healthy that we hu- mans can also remain healthy. That's the idea behind our \"One Health. One Beauty\" concept (see page 9). Speaking of the 1 % programme: What are Weleda's most significant investment and innovation areas for the future? MB We will naturally continue to invest in our product range. For example, we will focus more strongly on research and development in pharmaceuticals. If we want to be suc- cessful, we have to work on the proof of concept for our medicines. To this end, we will be making investments in the double-digit million range in the future. Our second area of investment is sustainability. With the 1 % programme, we are investing one additional per cent of our global gross sales to take responsibility for nature and the environment - that's well over four million euros per year. Of course, we GROWTH CAN ALSO BE SUSTAINABLE How do we solve the most pressing issues facing the future? Nataliya Yarmolenko and Michael Brenner discuss why Weleda places purpose over profit - and why business growth remains vital. will also invest in infrastructure and processes, such as our new logistics site in Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd, Germany, which has been designed to the highest sustainability standards. Is the connection between people and nature devel- oping and becoming more robust in the markets? NY Yes, I can attest to that, and market research reflects it, too: people's longing for nature continued to grow, even during the pandemic. Especially during lockdown, nature was an important retreat. In addition, consumers have a growing need for honest communication. It's tricky to navi- gate the greenwashing jungle; many statements out there are misleading. We see it as our responsibility to set stan- dards and provide orientation for our customers - through the NATRUE seal for our natural and organic cosmetics, the UEBT seal for our raw material supply chains, and now with B Corp certification for the whole company. This is how we are showing what it means to be an authentically sustainable company. \u00abWith the 1 % programme, we are investing an additional one per cent of our global gross sales to take responsibility for nature and the environment.\u00bb MICHAEL BRENNER Weleda is a stock corporation. How can a \"purpose over profit\" approach be reconciled with the owners? MB The owners have to support this approach. And they showed their support by anchoring the purpose in our arti- cles of incorporation. The purpose is the foundation for everything that the company does. We have two main shareholders who also put purpose first. To put it in con- crete terms, they allow us to use our profit not only for div- idends but in order to implement our purpose in the world. Is Weleda giving up on profit? How does this focus affect its market development? NY The question is, what is our attitude toward profit? Do we want to maximise our profit? No, we put our purpose above profit in everything we do. But we need profit to live our purpose: to invest in sustainability and, in the future, to be resilient and independent. That is how we see profit. In terms of finances, is it even enough to break even?

CERTIFICATIONS B Corp Shaping the global culture change togetherCLIMATE NEUTRALITY The feedback from the certification process was one of the impulses for us to pursue ambitious climate protec - tion targets. For example, with our 1 % programme, we are investing an additional one per cent of our sales mainly in climate protection, soil health, and biodiversity. At the product level, all Weleda natural cosmetic products and medicines worldwide will become arithmetically cli - mate-neutral from 2022. This applies to the company's overall carbon footprint as well as everything needed for the products - such as transport, supply chains, the culti- vation of raw materials, and packaging, including produc - tion and disposal. Our goal is to continuously improve and meet ever-higher standards. This development will be re-evaluated for our recertification in 2024. Creating a fairer world, less poverty, a healthier environ - ment and more meaningful jobs define the corporate pur - pose of so-called B Corporations or B Corps for short. Since October 2021, the global Weleda Group has been part of the global B Corp movement as a certified B Corporation. Like other B Corps, we are using our business model to bal - ance financial and ethical value creation in our work. With this approach that is still unusual for business enterprises, B Corps are a new type of company for whom profit maxi - misation is not the main driver of success. B Corps do not compete to be the best companies - they compete to be the best for the world. \"Making business a force for good\" is the vision behind this movement to change the system. To obtain B Corp certification, a company needs to score at least 80 points out of a possible 200. Weleda well exceeded the minimum score with 106.9 points. The pro - cess involved answering and providing evidence for over 200 questions addressing all aspects of the company: cor - porate management, employees, community, environment, and customers. More than 100 employees worldwide were involved in completing the B Impact Assessment. One of the prerequisites for B Corp certification is anchoring stakeholder governance commitments in the company statutes. So in June 2020, the owners of Weleda amended its charter; it now clearly states the aim of using its busi - ness activities to make a significant positive impact on society and the environment - a commitment that Weleda has consistently pursued for 100 years. The non-profit organisation B Lab monitored the cer - tification process and assessed the entire company. Their analysis showed that many of our corporate activities al - ready create added value and positively impact the com- mon good. This includes certified Weleda natural and or - ganic cosmetics and our equitable relationships with culti- vation partners. Our MUNDI sustainable development centre in Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd, Germany, also made a positive impression on B Lab. School classes, clubs and companies can visit the centre to experience sustainability first hand. Our collaboration with sustainable banks was highlighted as a further positive aspect of our operations, along with our publications, which offer readers inspiration for a green lifestyle.How does B Corp certifi- cation benefit natural cosmetics users? Customers are increasingly aware of the impact of con- sumption on our planet and society. People are quite rightly demanding that brands and companies ad- dress the consequences. Not only has this become a key aspect of the product and brand promise, it also helps make the world a bet- ter place. Does this also apply to Weleda medicines? As the industry leader in cer- tified natural and organic cosmetics and anthropos- ophic medicines, we gladly build on this momentum to increase our impact. The pharmaceuticals industry is not as far along as the beau- ty industry in terms of sus- tainability, so we want to take a pioneering role in this sector as well. Dr. Stefan Siemer is head of sustain- ability at Weleda. OUR CERTIFICATIONS For over 100 years, we have been committed to a world in which human beings and nature thrive in harmony. To do so, we ensure strict certification standards. An overview. For a better world Weleda in the markets: Brazil Local sustainability strategy In 2021, Weleda Brazil developed a local sustainability strategy based on the company's global strategy. All aspects of the B Corp assessment served as a guide in assessing the current sustainability status, including a carbon emissions inventory of operations in Brazil. Five pillars have now been defined as areas of focus until 2025: sustainable products, environmentally sustainable and responsible opera- tions, climate protection, diversity and social inclusion, and ethics and leadership. 200,000 ha Land protected 16 M Tonnes of carbon offset 225 M Litres of water savedB CORPS WORLDWIDE ACHIEVEMENTS THROUGH SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES B Corp certification is issued by the global non-profit organisation B Lab. There are currently around 4,500 certified B Corps worldwide from over 150 industries and 77 countries. 18 19CERTIFICATIONS ONE HEALTH. ONE BEAUTY. NATRUE Why the EU chemicals strategy poses major challenges for the natural cosmetics industry The European Union has launched the European Green Deal. Its main goal is for Europe to be climate neutral by 2050. But what is less well known is the new EU chemicals strategy this entails. How will it af- fect natural and organic cosmetics? The EU wants the environment to be toxic-free. The plan involves assessing how \"dangerous\" each chemical sub- stance is, regardless of how factors such as concentration, for example, influences its effects. This new approach pos- es major challenges to the natural and organic cosmetics industry. Natural substances are often complex combina- tions of many different substances, and that is how they have been considered so far. Now it is required to prove that each individual substance is hazard-free. For us, under- taking this task would cause expenses to skyrocket. And it would be required even though we already know that the vast majority of natural substances can be used safely - something that has been proven by many centuries of ex- perience. What does it mean for Weleda if the EU chemicals strategy is successful? It would affect not only the essential oils but also the nat- ural extracts and fatty oils we use in our products. We would have to identify the exact composition of each natu- ral raw material and the hazard potential of every single substance it contains. If there is no existing data, we would have to produce it - that means costs in the seven-digit range. And insufficient data on a single substance might mean that we would no longer be allowed to use the natural substances that contain it. The EU has not yet grasped the complexity of the situation. Of course, we are intensely en- gaged in ensuring a better understanding of the matter. Are there any other challenges? Almost daily, we encounter products that pretend to be natural. Greenwashing remains a threat to true and trust- worthy natural and organic cosmetics. One relatively new trend is \"Clean Beauty\". These cosmetics promise consum- ers that they are particularly safe and \"clean\" despite their use of chemical and synthetic substances. But their mar- keting implies that they are natural and sustainable. NATRUE monitors political and regulatory develop- ments for natural and organic cosmetics at both the European and international levels. What actions is the non-profit organisation taking to protect natural and organic cosmetics? Defending natural raw materials and especially essential oils is currently a central task. Through our NATRUE office in Brussels, we are lobbying EU committees and growing our network through collaborations. For example, we are working together with the IVDK, the Information Network of Dermatological Clinics, who collect data on contact aller- gies from the entire DACH region. Through scientific docu- mentation, we want to prove that natural substances - es- pecially essential oils - are not drivers of allergies. There will be an initial publication of the results in the first half of 2022. UEBT How we will measure biodiversity in the future with a satellite-based pilot project In 2021, we committed to working with our suppliers to de- velop measures to preserve biodiversity. To this end, we will implement the Biodiversity Action Plan, which compris- es a comprehensive catalogue of actions drawn up by the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT) to actively promote bio- diversity in various supply chains. The goal: To preserve good soil and clean water, protect natural ecosystems, renaturalise landscape structures and support beneficial organisms. Weleda natural and organic cosmetics carry the UEBT seal, a globally recognised standard for ethical trade in natural resources. During the audits of our raw material suppliers, we check whether the requirements of the Union for Ethical BioTrade are being met. This has shown that we need to work more closely with our suppliers to promote biodiversity. We need tools to measure and document bio- diversity. Easy-to-use monitoring systems are needed to carry out such measurements, derive suitable support measures from them, and check them continuously. At the same time, the effort required of our suppliers to use these tools should be kept as low as possible. In 2022, we will im- plement the Biodiversity Action Plan in specific supply chains. With the wide variety of raw materials we source, we look for cost-effective solutions. Together with UEBT and other strategic partners, we are working on a satel- lite-based pilot project. Before we introduce the new meas- uring technology to our raw material suppliers, we will test it at our German medicinal plant garden in Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd. Using the collected geospatial data, we can quanti- fy and evaluate the ecological impact of cultivation. Based on our evaluations, we will develop plans to improve long- term biodiversity in the cultivation and harvesting of natu- ral raw materials. The protection and regeneration of biodi- versity is one of the most critical tasks for the future. UEBT certification is issued to compa- nies whose raw material sourcing meets strict standards on the ethical treatment of people and biodiversity. The slogan says what the non-profit organisation promotes: how compa- nies and suppliers can extract raw ma- terials so that biodiversity is pre- served and used sustainably. NATRUE is an international non-profit organisa- tion that promotes and protects authentic natu- ral and organic cosmetics. The NATRUE label sets high standards to ensure quality and integrity. natrue.orgThe UEBT label guarantees that biodiversity is preserved during the use of natural raw materials and that all supply chain participants receive equitable treatment and fair pay. ethicalbiotrade.org Dr. Bernhard Irrgang is head of research and development for Weleda natural and organic cosmetics and has been president of NATRUE since 2019.

ONE BEAUTY. CLIMATE PROTECTION The path to climate neutrality Weleda is also answering the call to support the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. The core aim of the agree- ment is to limit human-caused global climate warming, if possible, to below 1.5 degrees Celsius. What part does Weleda play in this, and is our climate protection plan ade- quate? To answer these questions, we use the complex and innovative X-Degree Compatibility (XDC) model. XDC measures a company's climate impact in relation to global warming and the economic sector in which the com- pany operates. Put simply, the model measures a company's emissions (CO2e) and calculates how much global warming could be expected if the entire world operated at the same emission intensity as the company analysed. The result is expressed in a tangible degree Celsius number: the XDC. Learn more about the methodology at: right-basedonscience.de/xdc-modellCOMPANY CLIMATE FOOTPRINT: PARIS COMPATIBLE According to the XDC model, Weleda achieves a value of 1.4 degrees Celsius at the company level (Scope 1 and 2) for the year 2021, thus meeting the main target of the Paris Climate Agreement. We effectively reduced the climate im- pact of our energy consumption through appropriate meas- ures and also offset it for 2021. PRODUCT CLIMATE FOOTPRINT AND OTHER INDIRECT EMISSIONS (SCOPE 3 GHG PROTOCOL): NOT PARIS-COMPATIBLE We decided to be transparent about all the climate-impact- ing activities that Weleda needs so it can operate as a busi- ness. These include a pension fund for employees in Swit- zerland as well as the energy consumption for heating wa- ter to take a shower and use our Aroma Showers. Depending on how broadly our activities are accounted for, the XDC calculation deviates from the baseline scenario aligned with the Paris Agreement by the following amounts: + 0.5 degrees Celsius (according to GHG Protocol, exclud- ing product use phase and pension fund, wages and sala- ries, taxes and bank balances) + 1.2 degrees Celsius (according to GHG Protocol with product use phase, excluding pension fund, wages and salaries, taxes and bank balances) + 1.3 degrees Celsius (according to GHG Protocol with product use phase and pension fund, wages and salaries, taxes and bank balances) The XDC analysis shows that we are on the right track. By the end of 2025, we aim to improve our overall cli- mate impact by around 350,000 tCO2e annually - equiv- alent to just under a third of our current emissions. If we achieve this goal, our overall reduction path will align with the Paris Climate Agreement. We have set ambitious targets for a climate-friendly future. Our first goal has already been achieved: Weleda has been a climate-neutral company since 2021.1 Weleda in the markets: Czech Republic A year of responsibility 2021 played a special role in the protection of healthy soils: Weleda Czech Republic became a partner of the Partnership Foundation, one of the largest environmental organisations in the country, and was a sponsor of the workshop series \"How to make the world healthier with Weleda\". 22 municipalities participated in the workshops. In addition, as part of the partnership, a Weleda garden was established at a public garden in Brno. The garden often hosts informational events and is especially popular with families. Climate-neutral company1 Climate-neutral products We have achieved climate neutrality at the company lev - el1 through various measures with a long history. For many years now, we have been reducing the energy con - sumption of our buildings, production sites and vehicle fleet and increasing their energy efficiency in the pro - cess. In addition, we are continuously increasing the share of renewable energy we use. For example, by switching to more biogas in Germany and Switzerland, we were able to increase the global share of renewable energy in our buildings by 7 per cent year on year, to over 55 per cent in 2021. Several of our subsidiaries already use 100 per cent electricity from renewable sources. The remaining 2021 emissions of 7,041 tCO2e have been more than offset by high-quality carbon certificates. It is important to us that climate protection also includes the protection of the soil and biodiversity and is implement - ed throughout our core business activities wherever possible. Our goal for 2022 is for all Weleda products to be arith - metically climate neutral. This enables our customers to make a conscious contribution to protecting the climate through their product purchases. In addition to corpo - rate emissions, our product-related climate footprint in- cludes emissions from packaging, raw materials and the transport of goods. Our initial analysis for 2019 showed a product-related climate footprint of approximately 100,000 tCO2e, with an accuracy of about 20 per cent. Since 2021, we have been able to base our calculations on more detailed data. As a result, we can realistically expect a significantly smaller product-related climate footprint. We fully offset these emissions through high-quality carbon certificates. But not reducing our emissions would be no better than greenwashing. So we are currently developing a climate action plan, including a concrete emissions reduction path, to implement our targeted emissions reductions. 1 According to Scopes 1 and 2 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol 22 23CLIMATE PROTECTION Sekem Farm, Egypt Weleda and Sekem Farm in Egypt have a long-standing partnership. Since 1977, Sekem has transformed over 680 hectares of Egyptian desert into fer - tile land. Our activities with the farm include sourcing biodynamic -quality jojoba oil and support of a new project focusing on climate protection. Sekem Farm, Egypt Sekem Farm's \"Greening the Desert\" initiative aims to reclaim another 1,000 hectares of desert soil. We are supporting this project by purchasing carbon offset certificates, which Sekem generates through its solar plants, among other things. Bio Foundation, Switzerland We support the Soil Fertility Fund of the Swiss Bio Foundation to maintain and rebuild soil fertility on 45 hectares of farmland in Switzerland and Germany. The aim is to create a carbon sink by increasing carbon sequestration by approx. 1,100 tCOe over 20 years. Peatlands in Jasmund National Park, Germany We financed the rewetting of two small moors, Schlangenwiese and Wesselsche Wiese, at Jasmund National Park on the island of R\u00fcgen. This is expected to increase carbon sequestra- tion by approx. 1,950 tCOe over 30 years. Intact moorlands sequester large amounts of carbon. Restoring habitats for indigenous peatland animal and plant species increases biodiversity. Reduction of emissions Purchase of carbon credits from climate protection projects that sequester or avoid COe. Insetting projects Acquisition of carbon credits from climate protection projects in the Weleda supply chain that seques - ter or avoid COe. Further engagement Positive climate impact without generating eligible carbon credits. Switzerland The Weleda headquarters in Arlesheim has been supplied with 100 per cent renewable energy since July 2021. This applies to both our buildings and our energy-intensive production processes. Since July 2021, we have also been sourcing 100 per cent biogas from a nearby plant.

Weleda has its own answers to these challenges.One HealthInfludo\u00ae oral solution is a tried and tested cold remedy among Weleda's medicines - also for children aged 6 and above.26 27 ONE HEALTH CHALLENGES FOR THE INDUSTRY The pharmaceutical industry needs to become greener. This is the stated goal of the European Union's new Phar- maceutical Strategy, which calls for reducing the \"harmful impacts on the environment\" of pharmaceutical substances. Germany's new Supply Chain Act also obliges German man- ufacturers of pharmaceuticals to fulfil their global respon- sibility to protect environmental standards and human rights in other countries, too. And the websites and annual reports of many pharmaceutical companies also testify to efforts to make their production climate-neutral, use more environmentally friendly packaging, establish lower CO transport solutions, and compensate for unavoidable emis- sions with environmental projects around the world. One of the most urgent tasks industry and politicians face is to reduce the number of pharmaceutical substances that enter water bodies. This became clear in a study con- ducted in 2019, which for the first time examined the risks posed by pharmaceutical residues in freshwater at a global level. Using trace amounts of an antibiotic and an epilepsy medication in water as a basis, an environmental scientist at a Dutch university developed a prediction model that can determine water contamination levels even in regions for which data is poor. Based on this model, since 1995 the risk of environmental damage from pharmaceutical residues in the water has increased 20-fold in some regions. The focus is on residues of antibiotics, which are designed to kill bacteria. These residues can cause severe damage to ecosystems in streams and rivers and seriously disrupt the purification process in sewage treatment plants by eliminating \"useful\" bacteria. Residues of hormones such as those contained in birth control pills are known to make alligators infertile and feminise them, and antidepressant residues are known to make fish aggressive. These residues and their degradation products enter the water primarily through excretions flushed down the toilet or incorrect disposal via sinks, as well as from farms where animals are treated with medicines. Of the approximately 3,000 active substances ap- proved for use in Germany and contained in more than 9,000 human and veterinary medicine products, only very HEALTH FOR PEOPLE AND NATURE Medicines need to be more strongly linked to environmental protection and sustainability because healthy plants, animals and microorganisms are a prerequisite for healthy people. \u00abOne of the most urgent tasks industry and politicians face is to reduce the number of pharmaceutical substances that enter water bodies.\u00bbStay calm, even in challenging times: Neurodoron\u00ae strengthens the nerves with potentiated gold and quartz and can help to alleviate symptoms of exhaustion and fatigue.28 low concentrations, which according to current knowledge are harmless to humans, have been detected in the environ- ment. Nevertheless, because of their effects on other organ- isms, these pharmaceutical residues should be kept out of the environment as far as possible. The German Environ- ment Agency therefore also sees an \"increased need for action\" aimed at reducing the release of pharmaceutical substances into the environment. THERE ARE NO EXCLUSIVE SPACES The need for action is all the more relevant for pharma- ceutical companies that have outsourced parts of their pro- duction to Asia. The state of the soil and water in the areas surrounding these factories is frequently deplorable, and the working conditions at the factories themselves can be inhumane. The laxer environmental and social standards in these countries make production cheaper, but the supply chains to Europe and North America are more vulnerable, and the carbon footprint is larger. Protecting bodies of water is just one example of how crucial it is to ensure that medicinal products are more close- ly linked to the issues of environmental protection and sustainability. While it is true that efficacy and tolerability have priority, questions such as where the raw materials come from, under what conditions they are processed, how medicines are packaged and disposed of, and how they degrade in the environment must also be relevant for ma- nufacturers, distributors, doctors and pharmacists, and also for patients. While there is already considerable awareness of the environmental impact of foodstuffs, textiles, and other products, there is considerable catching up to do in the case of medicines. In a world where organic foods and eco clothing are widely available, and various labels and certifications provide information about their CO footprint and environ- mental and social compatibility, the time has come to intro- duce organic medicines sold at organic pharmacies. In the health sector, too, there is no alternative to a large-scale green revolution. In a world that is more inter- connected than ever before, whose inhabitants all breathe the same air, drink the same water and obtain their nourish- ment from the same soil, there are no exclusive spaces. Healthy plants, animals and microorganisms are a prerequi- site for healthy humans. Only if the planet is healthy can its inhabitants be healthy. Globalisation must therefore evolve into green globalisation - and the pharmaceutical industry into a green industry. \u00abWhile there is already considerable awareness of the environmental impact of foodstuffs, textiles and other products, there is considerable catching up to do in the case of medicines.\u00bbEuphrasia\u00ae Eye Drops contain herbs to soothe itchy or burning eyes. Arnica Bumps & Bruises Skin Salve 30 % provides relief for muscle aches, sprains and bruises. 30 31 In February 2022, the medical journal \"Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\" published the results of an observational study of the Weleda medicine Neurodoron\u00ae, which contains a complex composition of minerals and metals (ferrum quartz, gold and potassium phosphoricum). Dr. Claudia Rother, a scientist and employee at Weleda, coordinated the study, which was conducted at 74 German pharmacies. Cristina Semaca, a biostatistician at Weleda, analysed the data of the 175 patients in total.1 Observational studies like this one provide a good body of \"external evidence\" in medicine, showing how well a medicinal product performs in practice. This is an important supplement to \"internal evidence\", which shows how well the medicinal product works based on randomised clinical trials, or in other words, in comparison with a control group. This was also demonstrated for Neurodoron\u00ae.3 As a research-based pharmaceutical company, Weleda will invest millions of euros over the next few years to deliver both external and internal scientific evidence for the effectiveness of its medicines through clinical studies. At the same time, our researchers are looking for new, effective medicines to treat the diseases of our times. 71 % of all patients said that their stress score was reduced after 3 weeks of treatment with Neurodoron\u00ae. 76 % of all patients rated the effectiveness of Neurodoron\u00ae as \"good\" or \"very good\". 39 individual symptoms were examined more closely. The sum score showed a significant decrease in stress-related symptoms, from 18.1 to 12.1 points. 97 % of all patients rated the tolerability of Neurodoron\u00ae as \"good\" or \"very good\".

At the end of June, it's all hands on deck at Weleda. At sunrise, even employees who normally work in the office or in production are out in the medicinal plant garden in the village of Wetzgau, north of Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd in southern Ger- many. This is the time of year when the calendula blooms , and it takes many hands to pick the orange flower heads. Still dew-fresh from the field, the flow- ers are then processed for our relaxing Baby Calendula Bath. Weleda's Cuts and Grazes Skin Salve also contains calendula, as well as witch hazel flower extract . Weleda's 23-hectare medicinal plant garden is one of nature's pharmacies. Spread out across flowerbeds and fields, more than 1,000 plant species thrive here, around 160 of which are processed into tinctures for medicines and natural and organic cosmetics. By sourcing renewable raw materials from its own biody- namic agriculture, Weleda also avoids sourcing difficulties, especially when it comes to rare species like the purple-flowered bittersweet nightshade cont - ained in yellow gentian , centaury and chicory provide the bitter extracts for Weleda's Amara Drops. Other plants that are harvested here are the male fern , silver willow leaves, osier and golden willow for Digestodoron tablets, as well as cotton thistle for our Cimicifuga drops to treat menopausal symptoms. The ubiquitous stinging nettle is also used, for instance, in Weleda's Combudoron Gel. \"Here in our own garden, we can watch out for the best moment for harvesting,\" says Dr. Christian Birringer, head of tincture production. \"And we also know the biography of the plants,\" he adds. The raw materials used in anthroposophic medicines should have as clean a history as possible. Ideally, the plant comes from its own soil: Weleda gardeners harvest about 90 per cent of the seeds they use from plants they have grown themselves - ready for the next season.

For Weleda, the gardening year is cyclical in two respects. Not only does it follow the rhythms of nature but also those of the company's eight medicinal plant gardens scattered across the globe - in addition to its largest garden in Germany, it has seven more in France, Switzerland, England, the Netherlands, Argentina, Brazil and New Zealand. The plants them- selves tell the gardeners what they need for healthy growth. \"The communication requires attuning the sen- ses,\" says Claire Hattersley, head gardener at Weleda's garden in Ilkeston in central England. She explains that medicinal plants fare better in locations that correspond to their natural habitat; cowslip, for example, is grown in a wildflower meadow there. Her colleague Jorge Giusto even lives in the Weleda garden in Argentina, at an altitude of 1,285 metres. And the eucalyptus oil for Weleda's Soothing Chest Rub comes from the garden in New Zealand.One Health: Green Pharma 34One Micro- and molecular biologist Dr. Aldo Ammendola explains why our medicine will continue to be an integral part of an environmentally sustainable health system in the future. Dr. Aldo Ammendola is a member of the Weleda Executive Board and responsible for Research and Development and Quality. How green is Weleda? Ecology and environmental sustainability are hard-wired into our DNA: for over a century, we have been producing plant-based medicinal products - made 100 per cent from plants grown using organic or biodynamic methods. Inciden- tally, most of the medicinal plants we use are grown in our company's own garden in Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd. We do not produce these medicines in low-wage countries with weak environmental and social standards, but regionally, in Ger- many and Switzerland, for example. \"For over 100 years, biodiversity, animal welfare and high ethical standards in our dealings with employees and suppliers have been at the heart of what we do. In both our divisions - medicines and natural and organic cosmetics - 80 per cent of our plant- based raw materials come from organic cultivation, including 20 per cent from farms using biodynamic methods. So we're already quite green, but we want - and need - to become even greener. What action do you plan to take? We are planning a wide range of small and larger measures. We want to double the proportion of raw materials from biodynamic agriculture in our products to 40 per cent com - pany-wide. This year we are launching our 1 % programme, which means that we will invest an additional one per cent of our turnover in climate protection, biodiversity and soil health. We aim to make all our products arithmetically cli - mate neutral, and we also want to improve in the areas of sustainable packaging, resource-saving research, environ - mentally-friendly production, pharmaceutical substances disposal and wastewater pollution. For example, in our production processes, we use environmentally friendly bioethanol, which can be made using much less energy than conventional industrial alcohol. And we want to help our customers and patients to navigate the jungle of Weleda develops medicines using an integrative ap- proach - combining traditional knowledge from phyto- therapy, naturopathy and anthroposophic medicine with cutting-edge scientific research methods. According to surveys, three-quarters of Germany's popu- lation is in favour of integrative medicine - the thera- peutic approach in which conventional medicine and com- plementary therapeutic systems such as anthroposophic medicine complement each other in a meaningful way. As a research-based pharmaceutical company and manufac- turer of anthroposophic medicines, Weleda attaches great importance to generating evidence through preclinical studies - for example, on the specific effectiveness pro- file of arnica extracts, which are made from the whole plant including the root, as opposed to preparations made from only the arnica flower. This means that integrative medicine is no less science-based than conventional medicine. The integrative approach is based on a holistic understanding of human beings in all their physical, mental, social and spiritual dimensions. Healing in this sense means not just overcoming acute illness but also strength- ening a person's ability to self-regulate in the long term. Integrative regulatory medicine using medicines made by Weleda aims to bring the systems of an organism that are out of balance back into a dynamic equilibrium, for ex- ample, in cases of stress-related illnesses or disorders of the digestive system. Taking a holistic approach greenwashing by establishing meaningful, verifiable labels and certifications. For Weleda, sustainability is not just a fashionable \"add-on\" but forms the core of our company's identity. We want to continue to be a pioneer and role mo - del in the long-overdue green revolution of the pharma - ceutical industry. How green can Weleda afford to be in a highly compe - titive industry? Like other companies, we also strive to make a profit - but only as a means to an end. We describe ourselves as a pur - pose-driven company, meaning that we do not focus on maximising profits at any cost. Our company's mission is to contribute to health and beauty - in harmony with people and in harmony with nature. 37 Plant power: Skin Food Body Lotion nourishes very dry skin with plant extracts such as soothing chamomile. 37Healthy soils, vital plants, beautiful skin: many things must come together for natural and organic cosmetics to be truly sustainable. Weleda is constantly developing in this respect.One Beauty 38 39 ONE BEAUTY CHALLENGES FOR THE INDUSTRY Pure spring water. Plant-based substances. Organic in any case: natural cosmetics are as old as humankind. For millen- nia, people used what nature offered until the mid-20th century, when big businesses took over the mass produc- tion of body care products. From then on, consumers welco- med chemical cocktails into their modern bathrooms and onto their skin. Natural organic cosmetics led a niche exis- tence after that, gathering dust in the first organic shops in the 1970s. What tentatively began out of a desire for a more environmentally friendly and healthier lifestyle has developed into a revolution in awareness. Ever more customers are turning away from blind consumption. They are leading a sustainable lifestyle based on a new outlook: How can I be conscious of my consump- tion? How can I reduce waste and my carbon footprint? What products help me do that? Not only do people want cosmetics to have a positive effect on the skin but also on the planet - that their consumption does not cause harm. That means they should be natural, as climate-neutral as possible in their production and use, made with active in- gredients from certified organic cultivation, fairly traded and microplastic-free. In Germany alone, around 1,330 tonnes of microplastics from cosmetics contribute to the ongoing pollution of oceans and soils. Ideally, natural and organic cosmetics should therefore come unpackaged and refillable. What packaging they have should not be made of plastic - or at least be made of recy- cled and recyclable plastic. In 2020, more than 80 per cent of participants in a survey said they buy natural cosmetics \"out of consideration for nature\". When the motivations for sustainable consumption were researched in 2021, 35 per cent of respondents said they chose sustainable cosmetics \"because of better quali- ty\", and 33 per cent preferred cosmetic products without microplastics for sustainability reasons. With the growing prevalence of issues such as climate change, the protection of endangered species and resources, and the Fridays for Future movement, \"green\" thinking has gone mainstream. In the German cosmetics market, only the natural and orga- nic cosmetics segment is currently growing - by five per GREENWASHING OR AUTHENTICITY? Even when something is labelled \"organic\", it doesn't always mean that it is organic on the inside. With growing demands for natural and organic cosmetics, the supply is growing, but so is the thicket of labels. \u00abEver more customers are turning away from blind consumption. They are leading a sustainable lifestyle based on a new outlook.\u00bbFor Mother & Baby: Stretch Mark Massage Oil in the green glass bottle prevents stretch marks with jojoba oil and arnica.

CONFUSING MARKETING PROMISES This consumer trend has caught the industry's attention. Shelves have long been stocked with \"organic\" brands bought up by large corporations, alongside products by tra- ditional natural and organic cosmetics manufacturers. The absence of legal requirements for so-called organic, near- natural, natural cosmetics or holistic natural cosmetics has led to a jungle of marketing promises appearing on packa- ging. How can consumers distinguish between them? How can they know whether to trust \"green beauty\", \"clean beauty\" or \"conscious beauty\" or if they have fallen for \"greenwashing\"? How are they to know what \"natural\", \"organic\" or \"eco\" entails? Seals can provide orientation, but many boast a wide variety of quality claims. Companies often tailor the certification to their own value system. Even the leading natural cosmetics labels of NATRUE and Cosmos differ in their requirements, despite their strict standards. Since 2007, the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT) seal guarantees that the raw materials used in UEBT-certified natural and organic cosmetic products have been cultivated and harvested \"with respect\" - respecting biodiversity and the rights of local communities, including contracts with fair pay and working hours. The Due Diligence Act passed by the German government in the summer of 2021 now requires all companies to ensure they operate in compliance with human rights. While this also applies to companies' direct suppliers, it does not apply to their entire supply chain. The entry of large international brands into the natural and orga- nic cosmetics business has led to a shortage of raw materi- als, particularly those of organic quality. Over the last two years, the Covid-19 crisis has exacerbated the situation. Es- FORSCHUNG & INNOVATIONEN tablished natural and organic cosmetics companies have, at least in part, been able to draw on long-standing relation- ships with producers around the world, and support them in social aspects or with technical know-how, such as in the switch to organic or biodynamic cultivation. We live in an age where thinking is no longer linear - from manufacturer to consumer, from purchasing deodorant to its disposal in the bin. People are increasingly thinking in terms of cycles. They want to take responsibility and buy products from companies they can identify with in good conscience. After all, beauty is the sum of what makes a person. It comprises not only appearance but also thoughts, feelings and actions. The beauty of people and the Earth are one.Certified natural and organic cosmetics have long since ceased being heavy on the skin. Where conventional products continue to rely on chemically derived substan- ces, such as silicones or synthetically produced hyaluronic acid, Weleda finds new sustainable formulations. Patience, perseverance and detective-like intuition - that's what it takes to make holistic natural and organic cosmetics even better. Countless laboratory tests are needed, for example, until the powdery skin effect of silicones in conventional cosmetics can be achieved with natural substances. \"We have now succeeded in doing this with blends of precious plant oils in our Skin Food Body Butter,\" notes Dr. Bernhard Irrgang, who heads research and development of natural and organic cosmetics at Weleda. \"Our new body lotions were tested against conventional products and actually scored better in absorp- tion and skin feel.\" Today, naturalness, smooth textures and scientifically measurable performance are complementary factors. The Prickly Pear facial care series is one case in point - Weleda's answer to the moisture booster hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid is produced chemically or with the help of microorganisms, some of which have been genetically modified. \"We found an alternative based on a plant extract,\" explains Dr. Irrgang. \"It's something entirely new, and we have filed a patent for the manufacturing process.\" Organic prickly pear extract supports the skin's moisture; the plant is a survival artist in low-water environments. \"Tests have shown that prickly pear extract significantly increases moisture in the skin,\" says Dr. Irrgang. In the beginning, there was also inves- tigative work involved. \"It helped that we have an incredible knowledge of plants,\" he adds. Weleda is one of the few natural cosmetics companies producing its own extracts and active ingredients.One Beauty: Effectiveness \u00abPeople increasingly want to buy products from companies they can identify with in good conscience.\u00bbNatural feels good!As one of four new shower gels, Energy Aroma Shower helps you feel uplifted and alert with extracts of ginger, citronella and cedarwood. 41Weleda in the markets: Benelux Weleda City Spa x Van der Valk Hotels Thanks to a collaboration with the well-known Dutch hotel chain Van der Valk Hotels, three new Weleda City Spas celebrated their opening in 2021. Since then, the spas at the three hotels in Vught (NL), Tiel (NL) and Ghent (Belgium) have welcomed nearly 1,500 visitors. The most popular services are the partner and relaxation massages and beauty treatments. In 2022, two more spas will be added - at the hotels in Lelystad and Gorinchem. 43Healthy soils store almost as much CO as the world's oceans - thanks to earthworms that convert plant residues into humus. At Weleda's medicinal plant garden in Wetzgau, Germany, they also contribute to its incredible biodiversity. Most medicinal plants do not like overfertilised soil. They love a \"meagre\" terrain, where they can develop according to their own nature and structure. A prime example is the Weleda garden in Wetzgau near the city of Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd in southern Germany. Across 23 hectares of soil, some 160 medicinal plants, including the bright orange flowering calendula, thrive in soil fertilised only with compost. \"Plants become bloated and produce more leaves than blossoms when they get too much nitrogen from syn - thetic fertilisers,\" says Dr. Christian Birringer. The pharmacist manages tincture pro - duction at Weleda. The soil is the foundation: there is no healthy growth without healthy roots. While a small biodynamic garden initially yields around 20 per cent less than conventional cropland, in the long run, it has more harvest cycles - while monocultures impoverish the soil. Since 2019, Weleda has been using true cost accounting (TCA) to compare the total costs of regenerative agriculture with conventional agriculture. Positive and negative effects, including on soil fertility, climate protection and the water balance, are determined in each case and converted into monetary values. For example, TCA showed that the positive effect of biodynamically grown calendula - from sowing to the end product - is 600 euros higher per hectare and year. This year, Weleda will launch a new programme to study biodiversity in conventionally and biodynamically farmed soils in greater detail. Caring for the soil Weleda in the markets: Spain School projects on biodiversity, agriculture and soil conservation Respect for the environment plays an important role in Spanish schools, where educational projects foster children's engagement. To support this valuable work, Weleda Spain invited schools working on biodiversity, agriculture, and soil conservation projects to participate in a competition in 2021. A total of 24 schools participated and submitted their projects. Their ideas ranged from insect hotels and birdhouses to biodynamic vegetable gardening. 42One Beauty: Healthy soils LARGE AND SMALL PONDS Fish and amphibians like toads and frogs populate the garden ponds and wetlands. Ducks paddle across the water's surface and help maintain biological balance by eating slugs before too many of them feast on the medicinal plants. PERPETUUM MOBILE Healthy soil, like that in Weleda's medicinal plant garden in Wetzgau, Germany, provides the basis of a healthy life cycle for mammals, amphibians, microorganisms and plants. Butterflies feed on the nectar in flowers, moving pollen between them and helping to preserve biodiversity.NEW EARTH In biodynamic farming, the soil is seen as an organism: the greater its biodiversity, the more valuable it is throughout the garden. Vital soil provides the foundation with its wealth of beneficial bacteria and fungi that break down minerals for plants through metabolic processes, so they need little or no biological fertiliser. Different areas are regularly given time for plant residues to compost and become nutrient-rich humus. 5 KILOMETRES OF HEDGES They structure the 23,000 m 2 site: Bushes and shrubs such as hawthorn and witch hazel, together with horse chestnut and other trees, provide cool spots for shade- loving medicinal plants, nesting sites for birds and retreats for hares and slow worms, and protect deer from sight. DIGGING TUNNELS Digging up earthworms in the soil pleases blackbirds and shows that the soil is healthy. The rain worms constantly compost plant residues into humus, which keeps the soil moist. Their droppings also serve as a valuable fertiliser in the subsoil. Medicinal plants like to form their roots inside the metre-long tunnels that the earthworms drill into the depths. 44 45Protective goggles and a sun hat of carna\u00faba straw: Harvesting the wax-laden palm fronds (below left) is strenuous and requires experience. The ground and roasted seeds of the palm fruit are a popular coffee substitute. ONE BEAUTY It looks like skyward fishing: in a palm grove in the hot, dry northeast of Brazil, half a dozen workers stretch long, swaying bamboo poles into the air. Each pole has a second bamboo stick tied to it, at the end of which is a sharp hand sickle; they use this tool to cut fan-shaped leaves from the palm treetops, about 15 metres high. A deft jerk with both hands - and the dark green leaves tumble rustling to the ground. Adhering to each leaf are just a few grams of a white, sticky powder containing a coveted substance: the wax of the carna\u00faba palm. With its high melting point, this wax makes facial care products like lipsticks and creams both smooth and stable. Weleda also uses it for this purpose, sourcing it from a company that produces the wax sustain - ably, certified since 2019 by the Union of Ethical BioTrade (UEBT, see page 19). The UEBT seal guarantees that raw materials have been sourced with respect for people and nature. Weleda itself has already been UEBT-certified in its natural and organic cosmetics segment since 2018, and auditing all its supply chains according to the UEBT stan - dard plays an important part. In 2021, slightly more than 80 per cent of the raw materials Weleda purchased for its natural and organic cosmetics were sourced from organic farms (a total of 2,100 tonnes), 16 per cent of which (410 tonnes) were grown according to biodynamic principles. These included numerous plants from Weleda's own gar - dens. Its proportion of biodynamically cultivated raw ma - terials is expected to double in the coming years. Some raw materials are sourced through wild collec - tion, such as the arnica flowers that are important for Weleda. A long-standing partnership in Romania ensures that Weleda has a constant supply with consistent quality (several ton - nes annually). It also means that the arnica pickers in the Carpathians have a reliable income, so they do not have to move to the city in search of work. Carna\u00faba wax, of which Weleda only needs about one tonne per year, also comes from wild collection of the plant's young, green leaves. Sourcing with Respect As the beginning, so the end: To ensure that customers can buy Weleda products with a clear conscience, Weleda attaches great importance to sourcing raw materials with respect and protecting biodiversity. This is also the case with the wax of the carna\u00faba palm. After harvesting, the leaves are spread out on a large area and dried under the sun. Then they are fed into a machine that chops the leaves, separates them from the waxy powder, and blows the powder through a hose into bags. Carna\u00faba palms grow for 20 years before yielding a first harvest - only 275 grams per palm with an average of 60 leaves. The complex harvesting process contributes to the conservation of this unique plant and helps preserve biodiversity in the Caatinga thorn bush savanna. When cutting the carna\u00faba leaves, workers also remove the tendrils of a rampant vine that would otherwise suffocate the palm trees with its thicket. One Beauty: Biodiversity46 47Why is the skin microbiome an important topic for Weleda? Weleda has been working intensively for three years on this topic, which we believe is a perfect fit for the company. We strive to preserve biodiversity in nature's ecosystems. The skin microbiome is also an ecosystem and thrives on the diversity of its microorganisms. What does this ecosystem look like? Research currently estimates that one person is populated by about 38 trillion microorganisms - roughly the same as the number of cells in our body. It is not possible to say pre- cisely how many different microorganisms are active on the skin alone, as each person has an individual microbiome. Is the skin microbiome the same as the skin barrier? No, the skin consists of three layers, and the outermost layer is the so-called skin barrier. Imagine it as a brick wall: the bricks are horny cells, and the cement between them consists of double lipid layers. The epidermis is the top layer of the skin, and the microbiome lies on top of that like a fine film. The microbiome exists in symbiosis with the skin and serves as its protective shield. As our largest organ, the skin protects our body from external influences, but it also needs protection itself. If the skin is healthy, the microbiome usually is too, and vice versa. What about the microbiome is Weleda currently wor- king on? We have started to identify which of our products are \"skin microbiome-friendly\". This is the case for the Skin Food range, and more of our holistic natural and organic cosmetics pro- ducts will follow this year. It is important for us to scientifi- cally prove that our products maintain the skin's microbiome in a healthy state and not throw it out of balance. What challenges does Weleda face in this regard? To have a positive effect, a product must provide the skin More beautiful with microbes The skin's microbiome is also an ecosystem. Weleda is taking a closer look at these microorganisms. Seven questions for the food chemist Petra Bach. with ample moisture - moisture is always good for the growth and maintenance of bacteria. Our products should not have an antibacterial effect but be microbiologically safe. . How can all this be proven? For this purpose, we are working together with the Liech- tenstein-based company My Microbiome. It developed a special laboratory procedure to determine the effect of our products on select bacteria of the human skin microbiome. There is now more public awareness about the soil microbiome. Are there parallels between the micro- biome of the skin and that of the soil? Yes, indeed. Both are ecosystems that respond to light and air and the surrounding environment. The more species they have, and the better the balance of those species, the more stable and resilient they are. One Beauty: Microbiome LABELS As much information as necessary, as flat as possible: Weleda is wor- king on packaging stickers with these characteristics. It is also de- veloping a new adhesive, enabling easy label removal. The jar can go on to enjoy a second life, maybe even as a jewellery box... THE LID Conserving resources starts with closure: The eco-design lid of the green glass jar of Skin Food Body Butter is made of lightweight and recyclable plastic. Once the container is no longer needed, the jar can be recycled with other waste glass, and the lid can be recycled with plastics. Unpackaged Less is more Refillable body oils and showers: launched in 2021, the Unpackaged project was an important step in the right direction. Customers last year could fill their own containers with four popular Weleda skin care products at three branches of the Alna- tura organic supermarket - in Frankfurt, Karlsruhe and Freiburg. The offer is one of Weleda's initiatives to re- duce packaging waste. \"The CO2 balance is up to 20 times better if you use re- usable containers over and over again,\" says Dr. Stefan Siemer, head of corporate sustainability at Weleda. If that is no longer possible, the containers \"should return to us in the long term,\" says Murat Haner, head of packaging development in Switzerland, describing Weleda's vision. One Beauty: Packaging BOTH THIN AND STURDY Clean, minimalist and good for the environment: Weleda is developing reusable and recyclable packaging using as little material as possible. One example is our Skin Food Body Butter. THE JAR Nourishing Skin Food Body Butter comes in a jar of green glass with a high percentage of recycled glass. It replaces the previous thicker-walled, partially recycled plastic container. The new jar is both lightweight and shatter-resistant, providing optimum protection for its content. 46Weleda in the markets: New Zealand More sustainable packaging Weleda New Zealand tackled packaging in 2021 to make it more environmentally friendly. Instead of using large quantities of bespoke packaging made of laminated cardboard as before, there are new boxes that come in two standard sizes, with lids made of unbleached cardboard. The boxes are not glued and are sturdy and plain enough to be reused at home for storage or gift wrapping. Moreover, they are compostable and recyclable. Petra Bach is Head of head of scientific and regulatory affairs, natural and organic cosmetics Organic Cosmetics at Weleda.

We thus aim to continuously reduce the use of resources and the volume of waste generated so as to protect the environment and save on costs. Intensity is strongly affected by the capacity utilisation of our facilities: the more products the facilities produce within the operating times, the lower the intensity (improved efficiency). Capacity utilisation depends primarily on the order situation, over which we have only limited influence. We do have a direct influence on the technical facilities ((energy-efficient production facilities), process control in production (lean workflows and smooth operation), formulations (cold or hot production of prod uct content) and the avoidance of waste during production and distribution.The following environmental indicators are essential for Weleda: the consumption of potable water and energy as well as the amount of waste in relation to the production volume of finished products and product content. The charts below show the suc cesses to date, the current status and our targets up to 2022. The key figures relate to the manufacturing countries of France, Germany and Switzerland.

Business performance The 2020 financial year was strongly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. The year 2021 was marked by volatility and unpre- dictability due to the ongoing pandemic situation as well as the discontinuation of reimbursements for homeopathic remedies in France. The total sales of the Weleda Group increased slight- ly last year from EUR 424 million to EUR 425 million. Our two business segments, natural and organic cosmetics and pharma- ceuticals, performed differently. The total sales of natural and organic cosmetics increased by around 3 per cent compared with last year. However, the total sales of pharmaceutical sales declined by 10 per cent. In the natural and organic cosmetics sector, all regions positively contributed to growth. Only France saw a decline in sales. In the pharmaceuticals business seg- ment, individual regions recorded positive developments. All of the markets recovered and sales increased, with the exception of France. The 2021 operating result is slightly above budget but lower than the previous year. It decreased by EUR 9 million to EUR 13 million, mainly because of investments in the market, higher de- preciation and amortisation from the modernisation and expan- sion of production facilities, and the challenges of the pharma- ceutical sector in France. Due to lower exchange rate losses and lower tax expenses, the consolidated net profit for the year decreased only slightly compared with 2020. The profit generated enabled an increase in the equity ratio. Net financial assets decreased by EUR 5 million in the financial year, mainly due to high capital expenditures, and amount to around EUR 68 million. Our future-oriented decisions are only possible thanks to the solid foundation we have steadily expanded in recent years. Our most important strategic decisions for the coming years include renewing our infrastructure, centred around the new logistics building in Germany and the modernisation and expansion of production facilities and IT infrastructure; invest- ments in research and development in natural and organic cos- metics and increasingly in pharmaceuticals; expanded service offerings; digital transformation; and the ongoing development of our sustainability programme. Employees In 2021, the Weleda Group employed 2,169 full-time equivalents on average for the year (previous year: 2,177). Weleda AG had an average of 1,096 full-time equivalents (previous year: 1,105). Risk assessment Risks are an integral part of business operations. A risk manage- ment system that enables the identification, analysis, control and monitoring of significant risks in the corporate environment is therefore particularly important for Weleda. In order to identify risks in good time and determine the appropriate action, our management regularly assesses, at Group level and at the level of Weleda AG, any significant internal and external risks that may impact the entire corporate environment. The Board of Directors discusses and approves the results of the risk assessment and associated measures each year. Development of sales The net sales of the Weleda Group for the 2021 financial year amount to EUR 424.8 million (previous year: EUR 424.1 million). This corresponds to a change of + 0.2 per cent or + EUR 0.7 million compared with the previous year (adjusted for exchange rate effects: + 0.7 per cent or + EUR 2.8 million). As a result, Weleda held its own in a highly competitive market strongly af- fected by the pandemic and its consequences. The net sales of the individual company Weleda AG increased by 4.8 per cent (CHF 14.0 million) compared with the previous year, mainly due to the good development of the German operating facility.

Sales in this region rose slightly by 1.0 per cent to EUR 212.7 million (previous year: EUR 210.6 million). In France, sales decreased by 22.2 per cent and amounted to EUR 60.8 million (previous year: EUR 78.2 million). In the other regions, sales increased by 11.9 per cent to EUR 151.3 million (previous year: EUR 135.3 million). The exchange rate effect on sales was negative and amounted to EUR 2.4 million.Result for the year The consolidated result for the year decreased by 11.0 per cent to EUR 6.8 million compared with the previous year. The financial result amounted to EUR -0.5 million, up from the previous year (previous year: EUR -3.4 million). This was mainly due to lower unrealised exchange losses. Income taxes decreased to EUR 5.9 million (previous year: EUR 11.3 million), mainly due to a one-time tax adjustment in the previous year in Germany in conjunction with the harmonisation of the transfer pricing model. The separate financial statements of Weleda AG showed a profit for the year of CHF 8.7 million (previous year: profit of CHF 10.6 million).Financial and assets situation As a consequence of the net result, the equity ratio of the Weleda Group increased again by 0.3 percentage points to 54.1 per cent (previous year: 53.8 per cent). Consolidated cash flow from operating activities amounted to EUR 15.1 million (previous year: EUR 38.0 million). Cash out- flows from investing activities increased by EUR 9.5 million compared with the previous year to EUR 20.8 million (previous year: EUR 11.3 million). Of EUR 20.9 million in gross capital ex- penditures, EUR 1.4 million was invested in intangible assets and EUR 19.5 million in property, plant and equipment. Around three quarters of the investments in property, plant and equip- ment and intangible assets were made at the two main produc- tion sites in Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd and Arlesheim. The cash flow after investing activities amounted to EUR -5.7 million (previ- ous year: EUR 26.7 million). Cash and cash equivalents decreased by EUR 4.7 million to EUR 68.6 million at the year-end. This resulted in a net finan- cial credit balance of EUR 68.6 million (previous year: EUR 73.3 million). Cash flow from operating activities for Weleda AG amounted to CHF 26.5 million in the year under review (previous year: CHF 18.7 million). After deducting net investments of CHF 11.5 million (previous year: CHF 8.1 million), this amount totalled CHF 14.9 million (previous year: CHF 10.6 million). Weleda AG repaid CHF 6.7 million in interest-bearing liabilities in the year under review (previous year: no repayment). Operating result The consolidated operating result (EBIT) of the Weleda Group decreased by EUR 9.0 million or 40.6 per cent to EUR 13.3 mil- lion (previous year: EUR 22.3 million). This was mainly due to investments in the market and production as well as the decline in sales of the pharmaceuticals business segment in France. The operating result in the separate financial statements of Weleda AG decreased by CHF 6.3 million to CHF 16.7 million compared with the previous year.Despite the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, global sales in the natural and organic cosmetics business segment in- creased by 2.9 per cent (previous year: sales growth of 1.9 per cent). In the D-A-CH region, sales increased by 0.3 per cent. In Eastern Europe, sales increased by 17.9 per cent. France again suffered a decline in sales of 5.3 per cent, mainly due to the gen- eral performance of the natural and organic cosmetics market in France. Sales growth in all other countries totalled 8.5 per cent. Development of sales in the business segments Natural and organic cosmetics accounted for EUR 343.0 million or 80.8 per cent of global sales (previous year: EUR 333.2 million or 78.6 per cent). The sales of pharmaceuticals decreased to EUR 81.8 million (previous year: EUR 90.9 million), corresponding to 19.2 per cent of global sales (previous year: 21.4 per cent). Global sales in the pharmaceuticals business segment decreased by 10.0 per cent in 2021 (previous year: decrease by 11.2 per cent). In the D-A-CH region, which generated around 62 per cent of sales, sales increased by around 10.5 per cent compared with the previous year. Almost all areas of competence were able to increase sales. In France, sales declined by 57.3 per cent com- pared with the previous year; the main cause continues to be the discontinuation of the reimbursement of homeopathic remedies in the basic health insurance. In the other markets, sales adjusted for exchange rate effects rose by 9.1 per cent compared with the previous year.

Research and development activities The growth of natural and organic cosmetics was mainly driven by market expansion and innovation. Weleda is continuing to build up its expertise in pharmaceutical research. For both seg- ments together, Weleda again invested double-digit millions in research and development this year. Outlook for 2022 The year 2022 will be characterised by ongoing uncertainties and volatilities in the markets. The war in Ukraine, rising costs through- out the value chain and general anxiety among consumers will have an impact on the 2022 annual result. Nevertheless, we will continue to invest in our future. As in the past, our investments will focus on innovation, market presence, brand strength and the sustainability of Weleda products in both the natural and organic cosmetics and pharmaceuticals business segments. We are consis- tently pursuing our strategy, which we expect will lead to rising operating profits over both the medium and long term.

Key figures and changes are calculated based on the exact amount and not the reported rounded amount. Consolidation principles Accounting principles This Annual Financial Report has been prepared in accordance with uniform accounting standards (Weleda Accounting Manual). These accounting standards comply with the provisions on commercial accounting of the Swiss Code of Obligations (article 957 - 963 b OR). The consolidated financial statements of the Weleda Group comply with the law and the articles of incorporation. Certain items of the balance sheet as well as the income statement are summarised in order to provide the reader with a better overview. These items are explained in detail in the notes. Scope of consolidation In addition to Weleda AG Arlesheim and its branch Weleda AG Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd, 26 subsidiaries are fully consolidated within the Weleda Group statements. These companies are, without exception, Group companies and controlled by Weleda AG Arlesheim. Weleda AG has direct or indirect invest - ments of more than 50 per cent in these companies. In the year under review Weleda Services B.V. and Weleda Healthcare AG were incorporated and added to the scope of consolidation. The non-con- trolling interest in Japan is consolidated using the equity method. The consolidated companies are listed in the notes. Consolidation method The consolidated financial statements are based on the annual statements of the Group companies as at December 31st 2021, which are prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Weleda Accounting Manual. The consolidation period is the calendar year. Capital consolidation is carried out in accordance with the Anglo Saxon purchase method. For the fully consolidated companies, assets, liabilities, expens es and income are stated at 100 per cent. Non-controlling interests in consolidated shareholders' equity and profit / loss for the year are disclosed separately. The carrying amounts of the parent company's investment are offset against the current shareholders' equity of the subsidiary companies. In accordance with the full consolidation method, assets and liabil- ities as well as expenses and income also of those companies in which a third party is involved are in- cluded in full in the Group accounts. Third-party shares of shareholders' equity and of the results of consolidated companies are disclosed separately. Currency translation The financial statements of consolidated companies in foreign currencies are translated as follows: current assets, non-current assets and liabilities are translated at year-end rates (rate on balance sheet date), shareholders' equity at historical rates. The income statement and the cash flow state- ment are translated using average rates for the year. The resulting currency translation effects are booked directly in retained earnings without impacting profit and loss. The following currency exchange rates are applied:Intragroup transactions, balances and intercompany profits All intragroup transactions and balances are eliminated, as were all intercompany profits stated in the balance sheet. Balance sheet and valuation principles In general, assets and liabilities are valued on an individual basis in so far as they are material and cannot be treated together as a group as is customary due to their similarity. Sales recognition Sales are recognised on the transfer of risks and benefits to customers or upon provision of the service. This generally corresponds to delivery of the products. Current assets Receivables and other current assets are reported at their nominal values. The general risk of loss and individual credit risk have been accounted for on the basis of value adjustments. The valuation of inven tories is conducted on the basis of acquisition or production cost while observing the principle of lower of cost or market. Non-current assets Acquired intangible assets are recognised at the cost of acquisition, less amortisation. Property, plant and equipment is recognised at acquisition or production cost minus depreciation. Small-value intangible assets and property, plant and equipment with a value of less than EUR 1,000 are depreciated in full in the year they are added. Financial assets are recognised at the cost of acquisition. Equity holdings are consolidated using the equity method. Where there are indications of non-current assets being overvalued, carrying values have been reviewed and, where necessary, adjusted. Liabilities Liabilities are recognised based on their nominal value. Provisions for pension plans and similar obli- gations are determined based on actuarial principles. The remaining provisions cover all recognisable risks for un determined obligations. Liabilities are recognised at the respective amount at which they are to be repaid.YEAR-END RATES in EUR 2021 Rates on balance sheet date2021 Average rates2020 Rates on balance sheet date2020 Average rates 1 CHF (Swiss franc) 0.965 FINANCIAL REPORT 2021 WELEDA GROUP Notes to the balance sheet and the income statement 1 Trade receivables 2 Other current receivables 3 Inventoriesin 1,000 EUR 31.12.2021 31.12.2020 From third parties 68,568 60,307 From companies in which a non-controlling interest is held 350 521 From shareholders 89 174 Total trade receivables 69,007 6,002 in 1,000 EUR 31.12.2021 31.12.2020 From third parties 6,271 5,843 From companies in which a non-controlling interest is held 12 7 Total other current receivables 6,283 5,850 in 1,000 EUR 31.12.2021 31.12.2020 Raw, auxiliary and operating materials 15,654 16,655 Unfinished products 9,510 8,790 Finished products and trade goods 40,741 41,021 Value adjustments on inventories -3,744 -3,954 Total inventories 62,161 62,512Treasury voting and non-voting shares Treasury voting and non-voting shares are recognised at cost at the time of acquisition.

Leasing transactions Leasing and rental contracts are recognised on the basis of legal ownership. Accordingly, expenses as lessee are recognised on an accrual basis, whereas the leased or rented objects themselves are not recognised. The total amount of outstanding non-current rental and leasing obligations is included in the notes.76 77ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2021 WELEDA GROUP ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2021 WELEDA GROUP 7 Provisions 8 Treasury voting and non-voting sharesin 1,000 EUR Pension provisionsTax provisions 1Restructuring provisionsOther provisions 2Total provisions as at January 1st 2020 33,639 263 0 75,366 Increase -612 Currency translation effect -199 -69 0 11 -257 as at December 31st 2020 effect 199 0 0 1,793 at December 31st 2021 36,508 132 1,340 Of which 1,127 Of which non-current provisions 35,665 132 213 38,413 74,423 1 The item Tax provisions includes only provisions for deferred taxes.. 2 The item Other provisions includes, inter alia, currency provisions, provisions for strategic projects and procurement for replacements following the sale of Iscador, provisions for legal cases and provisions for jubilee and other long-service bonuses. in 1,000 EUR 2021 2020 Stock of treasury voting shares as at January 1st (in number: 219 / prior year: 219 ) 504 478 Addition of treasury voting shares (in number: 34 / prior year: 20 ) 113 59 Disposal of treasury voting shares (in number: 124 / prior year: 20 ) -282 -36 Cumulated currency differences 24 3 Stock of treasury voting shares as at December 31st (in number: 129 / prior year: 219 ) 359 504 Stock of treasury non-voting shares as at January 1st (in number: 1 / prior year: 35 ) 4 42 Addition of treasury non-voting shares (in number: 6 / prior year: 14 ) 25 55 Disposal of treasury non-voting shares (in number: 0 / prior year: 48 ) 0 -91 Cumulated currency differences 1 -2 Stock of treasury non-voting shares as at December 31st (in number: 7 / prior year: 1 ) 30 4 Total treasury voting and non-voting shares as at December 31st 389 508 2021, six non-voting shares were acquired at an average transaction price of EUR 3,984.4 Non-current assets Financial assets include non-current amounts due from third parties, securities and investments of less than 20 per cent. Investments in non-controlling interests include investments in companies in which the Weleda Group holds between 20 and 50 per cent. Increases are due to equity valuation. Increases in intangible assets mainly comprise software.

Board of Directors' responsibility The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the requirements of Swiss law and the consolidati- on and valuation principles as set out in the notes. This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further respon- sible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are rea- sonable in the circumstances. Auditor's responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these con- solidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable as- surance whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain au- dit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selec- ted depend on the auditor's judgement, including the as- sessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the en- tity's preparation of the consolidated financial state- ments in order to design audit procedures that are appro- priate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the enti- ty's internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31st 2021 comply with Swiss law and the consolidation and valuation principles as set out in the notes. Report on other legal requirements We confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licensing according to the Auditor Oversight Act (AOA) and independence (article 728 CO) and that there are no circumstances incompatible with our independence. In accordance with article 728 a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of consolidated financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors. We recommend that the consolidated financial state- ments submitted to you be approved.

REPORT 2021 WELEDA AG ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2021 WELEDA AG Notes to the financial statements of Weleda AG General Due to rounding, individual figures in this report may not add up exactly to the reported sum. Key figu- res and changes are calculated based on the exact amount and not the reported rounded amount. Accounting principles This Annual Financial Report has been prepared in accordance with uniform accounting standards (Weleda Accounting Manual). These accounting standards comply with the provisions on commercial accounting of the Swiss Code of Obligations (article 957 - 963 b OR). The Annual Financial Report of Weleda AG complies with the law and the articles of incorporation. Certain items of the balance sheet as well as the income statement are summarised in order to pro- vide the reader with a better overview. These items are explained in detail in the notes. Currency translation The accounts of the German business establishment are stated in euro and translated at year-end as follows: current assets, non-current assets and liabilities are translated at year-end rate (rate on balan- ce sheet date), shareholders' equity at historical rate. The income statement and the cash flow state- ment are translated using the average rate for the year. The resulting currency translation effects are booked directly in the income statement. The following currency exchange rates are applied: Balance sheet and valuation principles In general, assets and liabilities are valued on an individual basis in so far as they are material and cannot be treated together as a group as is customary due to their similarity. Sales recognition Sales are recognised on the transfer of risks and benefits to customers or upon provision of the service. This generally corresponds to delivery of the products. Current assets Receivables and other current assets are reported at their nominal values. The general risk of loss and individual credit risk have been accounted for on the basis of value adjustments. The valuation of inven tories is conducted on the basis of acquisition or production cost while observing the principle of lower of cost or market.YEAR-END RATE in CHF 2021 Rate on balance sheet date2021 Average rate2020 Rate on balance sheet date2020 Average rate 1 EUR (Euro ) 1.036 1.081 1.082 1.070Non-current assets Acquired intangible assets are recognised at the cost of acquisition, less amortisation. Property, plant and equipment is recognised at acquisition or production cost minus depreciation. Small-value intangible assets and property, plant and equipment with a value of less than CHF 1,080 / EUR 1,000 are depreci- ated in full in the year they are added. Financial assets are recognised at the cost of acquisition. Equity investments are also recognised at acquisition values and depreciated over five years. Additions to equity investments up to CHF 100,000 are fully depreciated in the year of acquisition. Where there are indications of non-current assets being overvalued, carrying values have been revie- wed and, where necessary, adjusted. Liabilities Liabilities are recognised on the basis of nominal value. Provisions for pension plans and similar obli- gations are determined based on actuarial principles. The remaining provisions covered all recognisable risks for undetermined obligations. Liabilities are recognised at the respective amount at which they are to be repaid. Treasury voting and non-voting shares Treasury voting and non-voting shares are recognised at cost at the time of acquisition. The holding of treasury voting and non-voting shares is disclosed as a negative item in equity. Upon resale, the profit or loss is allocated directly to the voluntary retained earnings. Leasing transactions Leasing and rental contracts are recognised on the basis of legal ownership. Accordingly, expenses as lessee are recognised on an accrual basis, whereas the leased or rented objects themselves are not recog- nised. The total amount of outstanding non-current rental and leasing obligations is included in the notes.92 93ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2021 WELEDA AG ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2021 WELEDA AG Notes to the balance sheet and the income statement 1 Trade receivables 2 Other current receivables 3 Financial assets 4 Equity investmentsin 1,000 CHF 31.12.2021 31.12.2020 From third parties 32,310 27,060 From associated companies 16,092 19,340 From shareholders 92 188 Total trade receivables 48,494 46,588 in 1,000 CHF 31.12.2021 31.12.2020 1,764 From 12,304 14,608 Total 14,800 16,372 in 31.12.2021 31.12.2020 Loans to Group companies 14,257 16,416 Other financial assets 326 410 Total financial assets 14,583 16,826 in 1,000 CHF 31.12.2021 31.12.2020 Investments in Group companies with an interest of more than 50 per cent 230 5,066 Other equity investments 26 52 Total equity investments 256 5,1185 Trade payables 6 Other current liabilities 7 Non-current interest-bearing liabilities All financial liabilities due within the following 12 months are disclosed in current interest- bearing liabilities.in 1,000 CHF 31.12.2021 31.12.2020 To third parties 12,798 11,011 To associated companies 5 7 To the statutory auditor Ernst & Young 16 45 Total trade payables 12,819 11,063 in 1,000 CHF 31.12.2021 3,625 To Group companies 11,188 14,701 To other related parties 455 0 To shareholders 46 36 Total other current liabilities 15,127 18,362 in 1,000 CHF Residual maturity 1 to 5 years 10,363 17,550 Residual maturity over 5 ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2021 WELEDA AG 8 Provisions Other provisions comprise, among other things, currency provisions for unrealised exchange rate gains on non-current financial positions, reserves for strategic projects, restructuring liabilities for the Weleda UK Pension Fund and provisions for jubilee and other long-term service bonuses. 9 Treasury voting and non-voting shares 2021, six non-voting shares were acquired at an average transaction price of CHF 4,307.

Weleda AG, Arlesheim, April 5t 2022 On behalf of the Board of DirectorsSince the statutory capital reserves and the statutory retained earnings have reached 50 per cent of the share capital, there will be no further allocation. Provided the proposal is accepted, the following distribution will be made out of the statutory capital reserves: Repayments out of reserves from capital contributions (statutory capital reserves) of a corporation are not liable for withholding tax (article 5 [1bis] VStG).

Board of Directors' responsibility The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the re- quirements of Swiss law and the company's articles of incorporation. This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further respon- sible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are rea- sonable in the circumstances. Auditor's responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these fi- nancial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain au- dit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial state- ments, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal con- trol system relevant to the entity's preparation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control system. An audit also in- cludes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting esti- mates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements for the year en- ded December 31st 2021 comply with Swiss law and the company's articles of incorporation. Report on other legal requirements We confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licensing according to the Auditor Oversight Act (AOA) and independence (article 728 CO) and that there are no circumstances incompatible with our independence. In accordance with article 728 a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors. We further confirm that the proposed appropriation of available earnings complies with Swiss law and the com- pany's articles of incorporation. We recommend that the financial statements submitted to you be approved.

This label guarantees that bio- diversity is pre served and used sustainably in the culti vation, harvesting and further processing of the plants. Weleda is also committed to treating all supply chain participants fairly and paying fair prices.France Since 2018106 107NOTES UEBT CERTIFICATION NOTES UEBT CERTIFICATION Ethical Sourcing Commitments Since 2012 we have been a member of the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT). The non-profit association promotes the respectful procurement of natural raw materials The ambitious standard for ethical procurement promotes sus- tainable economic growth, local development and the protection and sustainable use of biodiversity. In accordance with our purpose \"unfold health and beauty in harmony with human and nature\", we have implemented the UEBT standard as a sustainability management system along all our natural raw material supply chains. In 2018, UEBT offered a certification programme for ethical pro curement. UEBT certifies procurement systems of companies that respect people and biodiversity. As a UEBT member, we are committed to innovation and procure ment practices that contribute to a world in which peop- le and bio diversity can thrive. With this in mind, and as part of our sustain ability strategy, we have decided to go one step further in our com mitment and introduce the certification of our Ethical Sourcing System (ESS) for all our natural raw materials used in our natural and organic cosmetics products. A subsequent risk analysis will help us to identify the need for lasting impro- vements and to determine what measures must be taken. As a next step, and as part of the certification programme, we are committed to taking further action along defined, so called priori tised supply chains. This will allow us to reach even more actors and areas for cultivation and wild collection to improve ethical sourcing wherever necessary. We achieved the first certification in 2018 and had a second successful audit in June 2019. In 2020, no further ESS certification audit was carried out due to the pandemic, but we nevertheless continued to implement all the necessary measures within the framework of the legal measures.Certification scope in figures 2021 We had 620 approved supply chains, which means that 100 per cent of the raw materials used were evaluated. In 2020 we purchased 239 natural raw materials from 107 sup- pliers for natural and organic cosmetics. 115 of our supply chains are defined as prioritised for verifica tion. Verification means that we confirm the information we have received from our suppliers for evaluation through on site audits. Due to pandemic restrictions, only seven audits were conducted in 2021. With the audits already carried out in previous years, the current status is as follows: \u2014 73 audits conducted \u2014 20 audits planned (in 2022) \u2014 16 at planning stage \u2014 6 are already certified by our suppliers themselves Of the 73 audits carried out \u2014 11 suppliers have already implemented their measures \u2014 36 suppliers have planned the implementation of the necessary measures \u2014 26 suppliers still have to prepare action plans. The measures mentioned are defined by the audits carried out at suppliers and include improvements in the social and environ mental areas. The follow up of the implementation of measures is carried out by our employees, a final check and approval are car ried out by UEBT and Weleda in accordance with the dual control principle. This is how we ensure our positive influence on people and nature. 2022 target Verification of all remaining prioritised supply chains Follow up of supplier measures and completion of verification audits The corrective measures from last year's audit are mainly adjust ments in our process descriptions and internal training. These measures were implemented in 2020, but will need to be further adjusted in 2021. This is primarily due to process impro- vements, such as the introduction of an online tool at UEBT, which will be used to evaluate all data from 2021 onwards. \u2014 With the introduction of UEBT's online tool, all our supply chains are being remapped and reassessed. \u2014 Definition of a supply chain and implementation of an impact study \u2014 Implementation of Biodiversity Action Plans in defined supply chains. Observation In 2021, not all audits were carried out as planned, mainly due to travel restrictions. New supply chains are also added every year, so that the number of supply chains to be verified is constantly increasing. Internal training measures with all relevant departments were carried out in 2020 too, in order to better explain the require - ments of the certification and their importance in day to day work. This training was conducted for research and develop - ment, marketing and project management, and may be repeated regularly. The current certification is valid until June 2021. We have noticed a strong interest in UEBT and the contents of the standard on the part of our suppliers. As a result of the audits, a number of suppliers have now decided to become members themselves.What are the guiding principles of the UEBT standard? Biodiversity conservation Sustainable use of biodiversity Sharing of benefits between companies and communities through the use of biodiversity Traceability to identify the origins of the natural ingredients Compliance with national and international regulations Adequate working conditions for employees and ensuring local food security No \"land grabbing\", instead measures to prevent illegal use What is the UEBT? The Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT) provides a globally recog- nised standard for ethical trade in natural resources. The non profit organisation is an offshoot of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).

The XDC model was developed in 2019 by right. based on science. It relates a company's emissions intensity to its economic perfor- mance and the potential of the company's industry. The model enables companies to measure and manage their compliance with the Paris Climate Agreement. Weleda uses the XDC model to calculate and understand our climate impacts, define science- based emission reduction targets, conduct forward-looking scenario analysis, prepare climate-conscious business decisions, and inform the public.108 109NOTES CORPORATE GOVERNANCE NOTES ADDRESSES Transparent and solid business management Weleda places great value on a transparent management structure and an open communication culture.
