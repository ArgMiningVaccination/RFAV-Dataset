Maybe you prefer to keep things simple and only take the basics, or maybe you're ready for something more to enhance your daily wellness regimen. Everyone's wellness needs and goals are personal and unique to them, so no two routines will be the same. That said, there are a handful of supplements to have on hand for both daily support and occasional use, no matter where you may be on your journey. Newbies and pros alike can benefit from these essentials, so stock your top shelves with some of the best supplements to have on hand and be prepared for whatever comes your way. Probiotics. Check off the boxes for both digestive and immune health with a daily probiotic.* [Probiotics](/articles/what-are-probiotics) are live organisms that support a balance of \"good\" and \"bad\" bacteria in your gut microbiome.* Probiotics' primary function is to support your digestive health, which can include protecting against occasional bloating, constipation, and digestive discomfort.* Because over 70% of your immune system is located in your gut, taking a daily probiotic can also support your immune health.* [Fortify\u00ae Probiotics](/brands/fortify) bundle these benefits and more, including prebiotics, a food source for good bacteria, into one convenient capsule that doesn't require refrigeration.* Immune support.* If you're not feeling your best, you can't do the things you want to do \u2014 making immune support supplements a total no-brainer, especially in the winter months.* You can support your immune health with many different ingredients and ways from standard vitamins like C and D to traditional herbs like black elderberry and echinacea.* However you prefer to support your immune health, find a format and the ingredients that work for you and stick to it each day.* Reactive cold and flu relief. Don't let feeling \"off\" ruin your week. Reach for a homeopathic cold remedy to help you feel better faster. One clinically proven homeopathic ingredient to look out for is [Pelargonium sidoides 1X](/articles/what-to-know-about-south-african-geranium-root). A multivitamin. Even if you have the best intentions with your lifestyle and try to eat as healthily as possible, you may be missing some important nutrients. A daily [multivitamin](/products/by-type/multivitamins#list) can fill in the gaps and help you hit your nutritional goals to feel your best, especially when life gets busy and you're swapping spinach for fries. Cough syrup. There's nothing more irritating than an occasional cough. Soothe your symptoms with a syrup designed to [relieve occasional coughs](/products/sambucus-honeyberry-cough-syrup) associated with hoarseness, dry throat, and irritants.* Look for ingredients like English ivy leaf extract and options with melatonin for nighttime relief.* Sleep support.* When you're dealing with occasional sleeplessness, almost everything in your life feels more difficult: waking up feeling rested, getting your work done, feeling positive and upbeat. When such instances happen, reach for [sleep supplements](/products/by-health-interest/sleep#list) to help you get the restful sleep you need.* Omega-3s. Many Americans aren't eating enough fatty fish like salmon in their daily diets, so supplementing with an omega-3 can be helpful to ensure you're getting the brain, eye, and heart health benefits.* An [omega-3 fish](/products/fisol-fish-oil) oil contains EPA and DHA, long-chain fatty acids needed for eye and brain support.* For example, Fisol\u00ae Fish Oil supports cardiovascular and joint health with 150 mg of EPA and 100 mg of DHA omega-3 fatty acids.* Supportive but not conclusive research shows that consumption of EPA and DHA fatty acids may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. (See Supplement Facts for total fat and cholesterol content.) Vitamin D. Our bodies' primary source of vitamin D is the sun, which is great in the summer months when days are longer and the sun is bright. However, if you live in a region that tends to be dark and cloudy in the cooler months, you may want to consider supplementing with [vitamin D](/products/vitamin-d3-max) to ensure you're hitting the recommended Daily Value. Stress support.* Certain periods of life are more stressful than others, but you can ride the waves and tackle the tough stuff with a little help from supplements. [Ashwagandha](/products/ashwagandha) is a traditional adaptogenic herb used in Ayurveda that helps your body adapt to daily stress so you can navigate the ups and downs with more confidence "}
