Initially we were linking clients directly into activities, groups and services but since Covid19 we have had to adapt and become the activity itself.

This really was a great experience and very important to the whole group\" (Frank, Service user of South Dublin County Partnership Social Prescribing project). \"Thank you for all your fantastic work with client/s referred.

You have put a realistic plan in place with him to see his way forward to socially engage, learn more and work in his community.
