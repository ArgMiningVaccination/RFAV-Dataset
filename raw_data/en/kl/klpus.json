Individuals with a weak immune system should isolate for at least 10 days (from symptom onset or positive test date) regardless if you have symptoms of COVID-19. Note: The Toronto Voluntary Isolation Centre is closed. If you have questions about self-isolation, you can call Toronto Public Health at 416-338-7600 (Monday to Friday; 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.). To stop the spread of COVID-19, it is important that you notify your close contacts, so that they can self-monitor for symptoms and self-isolate (stay home) if symptoms develop. A close contact is anyone who you spent time with when you were infectious. Please refer your close contact to the [what to do if you are a close contact](https://www.toronto.ca/home/covid-19/covid-19-what-you-should-do/covid-19-what-to-do-if-you-are-a-close-contact/) webpage for more information. High-risk settings are settings where there are vulnerable populations and/or where risk for transmission is greatest. High-risk settings include: If you live in a high-risk setting, you must self-isolate for at least 5-10 days after the positive test date or symptom onset (whichever is earlier), depending on the setting. Follow the isolation direction provided by the setting. Self-isolate for your required isolation period and until you have no fever and your symptoms have been improving for 24 hours (or 48 hours if gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and/or diarrhea). If you work/volunteer/attend a high-risk settings you should follow the direction in the [Stay Home and Self-Isolate](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/health-wellness-care/health-programs-advice/respiratory-viruses/covid-19/covid-19-what-you-should-do/covid-19-what-to-do-if-you-have-covid-19/?accordion=stay-at-home-self-isolate) section above. Generally, you can return to work after 10 days. Speak to your employer and follow workplace instructions for return to work. If you work in a high-risk setting, tell your employer that you have tested positive for COVID-19 and follow workplace policies. If you do not work in a high risk setting, it is recommended that you tell your employer to decrease the spread of COVID-19 in your workplace. If you test positive for COVID-19, you may be contacted by the Assessment Centre or Toronto Public Health. You may receive either a text message, a call, or both in some cases.

You do not need a test to show you have recovered from COVID-19 or to end your isolation. Re-testing is not recommended because you may still test positive for several weeks even though you are no longer infectious. A negative test, doctor's note, or clearance letter is not required for you to return to work and Toronto Public Health does not provide return-to-work letters. In general, you can return to work, school, and your everyday activities when you have no fever and your symptoms have been improving for at least 24 hours (48 hours if you have gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting or diarrhea). If you work in a high-risk setting, you can return to work after 10 days from positive test date or symptom onset (whichever is earlier), or sooner in some instances. Speak to your employer and follow workplace policies. Toronto Public Health recommends that you continue to practice prevention measures. These include hand washing and physical distancing, where possible. Toronto Public Health also recommends wearing a [well-fitted, high quality mask](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/health-wellness-care/health-programs-advice/respiratory-viruses/covid-19/reduce-respiratory-virus-spread-guide/) when in indoor public settings, especially if they are crowded or have poor ventilation or if you are around people who are at higher risk (such as seniors or those with a weak immune system). Masks are especially recommended for people at higher risk of getting seriously sick from COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses. Masks are still required in [some settings](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/health-wellness-care/health-programs-advice/respiratory-viruses/covid-19/reduce-respiratory-virus-spread-guide/).
