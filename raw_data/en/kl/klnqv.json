Introduction Knee osteoarthritis (OA) isacommon joint disease worldwide and istheleading cause ofpain and intheelderly. Inthefirst decade ofthe21st century, nearly 27million Americans hadsuffered from symptomatic knee OA, with advanced OAaccounting more than halfof them alongitudinal study involving 17,128 Chinese residents aged 45 years and older showed that theoverall prevalence ofsymptomatic knee OAwas8.1% [3].In rural China, symptomatic knee common (16.57%), and increased significantly 24.71% formen) [4]. Patients with knee pain physical limitation, aswell aspsy- chiatric with effective and enhance themobility, quality oflifeshould byreviews management of evidence, which canprovide gaps\u00ba, thus informing More specifically, weused the PICO inclusion criteria: participants, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes. Participants. Patients diagnosed with knee OA, atanyseverity, which were either (1) diagnosed bytheAmerican criteria, were included. Interventions. Alltypes ofinterventions pertaining and inter- ventions to)thefollowing: acupuncture, electroacupuncture, Chinese herbal treatment, moxibustion, TaiChi, Qigong, Chinese herbal bath, and massage. Comparisons. The control interventions included non-treatment, sham treatment, pla- cebo treatment, and routine treatments (e.g., health education, weight management, strength training, physiotherapy, acetaminophen therapy, glucosamine treatment, and NSAID therapy). Outcomes. Inaccordance with theOsteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) Clinical Trials Recommendations [17], wecategorized theoutcomes into seven types: binary benefit outcomes, patient-reported outcomes, objective outcomes, structural outcomes, bio- chemical biomarkers, adverse effects, and economic evaluations. Among these categories, the binary benefit outcomes included all-cause mortality, recovery, and disability events. The core setpatient-reported outcomes were assessed using three clinical measures, namely, pain, phys- icalfunction, and patients' global assessment, which were inRheumatology Clinical Trials (OMERACT) IIIConference [18]. Allthebinary comes regarded astheprimary outcomes, whereas theremaining sixoutcomes were con- sidered toApril 2016. Intervention search terms were notincluded inthesearch terms because toidentify allSRsforanytypes of TCM, and only terms ofknee were incorporated. The search lan- guage Selection ofSRs Initially, thetitles and abstracts oftheidentified articles were reviewed.
