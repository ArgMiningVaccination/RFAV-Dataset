Information pertaining to working vaccines has got to be some of the most sought-after information on the planet right now.

It's not a mix of particular chemicals mixed under various circumstances. It's synthesized RNA, packaged in a blob of something fatty, and you need considerable knowledge about RNA synthesis (not to mention a RNA synthesizer) and experience with lipid membrane technology. Having the genetic sequence for the vaccine is the smallest hurdle. (If you have no experience making high performance CPU's, you can steal all the blueprints you want from AMD and Intel and Apple, there is no way you are going to make functioning CPU's in your garden shed..)

Which seems like a net good regardless of how they got their hands on the information. There are 3 possible reasons for the hacks: 1. Someone who has not been able to develop their own vaccine wants to steal information on ones that work 2. Someone whose vaccine is having problems is stealing information to see where they went wrong 3.

General fuckery I mean, there's more than that: Regarding 2, even if someone's vaccine is working fine, having that data might still allow improvements or comparison (assuming it isn't otherwise already available) Regarding 3, it's a lot of effort for mere vandalism. Rather, I suspect it'll be one or more of: 4. Future industrial espionage - APTs could be setting up beachheads now while everyone is busy with COVID and likely cutting corners 5. Sabotage - Someone without a working vaccine being resentful or someone with a working vaccine making their vaccine more valuable (if there are fewer available alternatives) 6. Corporate espionage - Creating a shortlist of the most prolific researchers involved to poach in the future. In a couple years, \"Oh hey, Dr. So-and-so, we think your <superlatives> efforts working on <COVID-related research> is going sadly unappreciated and unrewarded at <funding-strapped research agency/current employer>. It was a bad break that <competing group/vaccine/researcher> got all the notice. But we're setting up <new biomedical research program> and think your <complimentary attributes> would be a great fit for <intractable research problem> and together, we'll <do important things>.\" So maybe they're stealing it to see how it works, to make something work against it. You never know the agendas of anyone these stealing it to see how it works, to make something work against it. You never know the agendas of anyone these days. How it works is public knowledge. It boils down to teaching your immune system this particular RNA sequence widespread misconception: many people incorrectly assume that Russia is still a state, rather than a global crime syndicate with nukes.

Although the information is useful in a lot of ways, the data that is given to regulators has very little to do with research and production. It will have a lot of anonymous patient information, proprietary numbers on yields and similar but little on actually how to make it.<other stuff snipped> thats a romanticized view but the state sponsored hackers are from countries with the ability to make their own vaccines, not some poor third world backwards nationsInformation pertaining to working vaccines has got to be some of the most sought-after information on the planet right now.

If China and Russia end up with better vaccines due to this theft of IP and save their citizens' lives I have great difficulty being even a tiny bit bothered by it. If they then go to market and start a bidding war with Pfizer, I'll be even less concerned.thats a romanticized view but the state sponsored hackers are from countries with the ability to make their own vaccines, not some poor third world backwards nationsInformation pertaining to working vaccines has got to be some of the most sought-after information on the planet right now.

I did not think that included the secrets of how to make the vaccine, the IP, etc, any more than Coca-Cola gives up its secrets in order to prove it's safe to drink. I'm not saying they did not hope for more, but if trial results data is all they got - because that's all that was submitted - then where's the loss (other than commercial sensitivities about launch timing)? Surely all such data ultimately must go into the public domain for "}
