And this time it's not about the latest handheld wireless gadget or its unrivaled innovation strategy. It's about the company's approach to manag-ing the global supply chain\u2014even when things go wrong. In case you haven't been following the story, here's a brief summary. Steven Jobs' replacement as Apple's chief executive, Timothy Cook, has been visiting overseas sites where Apple products are made (I'll come back to the importance of this ac-tion later on). In late March, he stopped at a site in Zhengzhou, China, that is run by Foxconn\u2014a multinational electronics manufacturer headquartered in Taiwan. Around the same time, the Fair Labor As-sociation (FLA) published the results of a month-long investigation into Foxconn, including three of its China-based facili-ties which manufacture Apple products (Guanlan, Longhua, and Chengdu). The independent audit, agreed to by Apple after it joined FLA in January, cited 43 violations of Chinese laws and regulations, including communication gaps, excessive working hours, and dangerous conditions (1). Foxconn has been under fire for some time, including being tied to employee suicides as reported in various media outlets, including the New York Times (2). Foxconn and Apple have since agreed to improve conditions. While adherence to labor laws is a cru- cial aspect of managing any facility, this story has additional lessons to be learned. Supply-chain management and security have been hot topics of conversation among the pharmaceutical industry for the past several years. The increase of counterfeit-ing, economically motivated adulteration, and globalization throughout the pharma industry\u2014much like that of the electron-ics or any other major industry\u2014only adds to supply-chain complexity. And here is where due diligence comes into play. Companies must visit their global sites. According to the Times article mentioned above, two Apple employees pointed out that Jobs never visited the company's fac-tories in China. It seems that Cook, in his new role, is aiming to change that prac-tice by taking a first-hand look inside the facilities that are manufacturing Apple's products. And because he, like most chief executives, cannot spend every day visiting and auditing sites, he's asking a third party to help (i.e., FLA). The pharma industry has similar options through third-party auditing organizations and consortiums. No matter the time or cost, knowing what's going on inside your facilities is always going to be worth the effort. Second, companies need to keep their communication lines open. In one section of the FLA report about Foxconn, the as-sociation notes specifically that \"commu-nication is a two-way process.... The more workers participate in those processes, the more they are accepted, trusted and effec-tive\" (1). Some of Foxconn's problems are reportedly tied to top-down only commu-nication. How many times have you heard someone in industry say that the Quality team doesn't communicate with the Devel-opment team, or that Senior Management doesn't communicate with the Techni-cians, and so on. Listening to employees\u2014no matter their department\u2014can only lead to improvement at all levels. Third, companies need to be trans- parent. Cook seems to be taking this seriously. A January 2012 Apple report included for the first time the names of companies that supply Apple with parts and services, something it had previ-ously declined to do (3). Apple's site also notes that it has audited every \"final as-sembly factory in its supply chain each year since 2006\" (4). The key phrase here is \"final assembly.\" We know from recent unfortunate events, that the final manufacturer, distributor, or assembler is not necessarily where problems can occur. Quality must be sewn into and confirmed throughout every point in a product's supply chain. Regulators have enforced this message repeatedly. I believe these points are must-do's to help secure the industry's product supply chain. A statement by Apple to the Times noted, \"Our team has been working for years to ... make Apple's supply chain a model for the industry..\" (5). Clearly, the company still has some work to do\u2014and so does pharma. But I think we're headed in the right direction. Sources: 1) FLA, Foxconn Invest. Report, Mar. 29, 2012. 2.) D. Barboza, N.Y.

The summit, organized by Newsweek/The Daily Beast, generated a meaningful dialogue on the innovative and diversified approaches for educational progress, business development, and individual economic advancement. These projects brought to mind the collaboration by the pharmaceutical industry, NGOs, and the public sector in improving women's and children's health in the developing world and the role that we can collectively and individually play. A large part of those efforts center on the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals, a set of eight antipoverty goals, which include specific targets to reduce maternal and child mor-tality. In support of these efforts, UNICEF and the United Na-tions Population Fund launched in March the Commission on Life-Saving Commodities for Women and Children to identify ways for improving the delivery of essential health supplies, including strengthening local production capacities, promot-ing new technologies, bolstering regulatory frameworks, and enhancing financing mechanisms at the global and local levels. The commission followed the launch by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in 2010 of the Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health supported by Every Woman Every Child , a global effort to improve the health of women and children. Pharmaceutical companies also are participating. In Septem- ber 2011, Merck & Co. launched Merck for Mothers , a 10-year, $500-million initiative with global health partners to advance solu-tions and raise public- and private-sector engagement for reducing maternal mortality. Last October, the Sanofi Espoir Foundation lent its support for Stand up for African Mothers , an initiative by AMREF, an African public health NGO, which seeks to reduce maternal mortality in Africa by 25% by training 30,000 midwives by 2015. In September 2010, Johnson & Johnson launched a five-year effort aimed at helping 120 million women and children in developing countries on an annual basis through programs fo-cused on maternal and children's health, including mobile health, R&D programs, and safe-birth programs. The value of such efforts cannot be underestimated as US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who spoke at the Women in the World Summit , emphasized. \"Nations that invest in wom- en's employment, health, and education are just more likely to have better outcomes. Their children will be healthier and better educated....So this is not just the right thing to do for us, to hold up these women, to support them, to encourage their involvement; this is a strategic imperative.\" The takeaway from Clinton and other notable women at the summit, such as Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Leymah Gbowee, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde, Facebook COO Sheryl Sand-berg, Chair of the White House Council on Women and Girls Valerie Jarrett, and former US Secretary of State Madeleine K. Al-bright, was clear. \"Every one of us needs to be part of the solution,\" she said.\" PTIndus try, the public sector, and individuals can play an impor tant role in creating solutions.

After a thorough review, the root cause was de-termined to be an inadequate manual-cleaning process. The filter housing had several valves that need specific cleaning techniques which were not performed. As a result, we rejected three batches worth $1 million in total.\" We never learn \"We have four manufacturing sites that make similar biological products around the world,\" began our GMP Agent-In-Place. \"In 1988, there was a leak that al-lowed the coolant from the jacket into the final stage of one product. We tested hundreds of batches, and ended recalling all in-date products\u2014nearly 300 batches. As one would expect, we put into place many corrective actions (i.e., pressure testing, inspections) in order to prevent recurrence. Fast forward to 2006 and a different site, same company. Another leak in the jacket allowed coolant into the product. Four batches were rejected, and another marathon testing session was undertaken to verify that on market batches were fine. \"Pretty upsetting, yes?\" noted our Agent. \"But we're not through. This year, the second manufacturing site had another leak affecting a different product. This time, 140 batches were recalled. Not only can't we learn from other manufacturing sites, we can't learn from our own.\"It begins with design \"Class A/B filling suites are care-fully designed and built to maintain a maximum amount of sterile prod-uct protection,\" explained our GMP Agent-In-Place. \"The equipment that controls the temperature, humidity, air pressure, and air filtration are all me- ticulously sized for this purpose. The rooms are then sealed to prevent incur-sion of particulates, microbes, or other contaminants. During routine produc-tion, we had a drip from the ceiling of the Class B portion of the filling suite during a fill. It turned out the design-ers had designed for 95% of the local weather conditions. But we manufac-ture 100% of the days, and it was one of those extreme days that caused the problem. The weather was 98% humid-ity. The plenum where the air ducts are routed was at ambient temperature and humidity. The air ducts carried chilled air to supply the filling room. The condensation on the outside of the air ducts puddled, and found a crack to drip into the fill room. In the end, insulating the air duct was sufficient to prevent recurrence. The product cor-rection was easy: reject all filled vials.\"Check your trends \"Although handling excursions in en-vironmental monitoring is important,\" our GMP Agent-In-Place pointed out. \"One critical use is to trend the data to catch problems before they erupt in significance.

We Deliver. 20 Pharmaceutical Technology MAY 2012 PharmTech.comIN THE FIELD contin. from p. 18 But instead of focusing on chemical-based medicines, it is concentrating on biopharmaceuticals, in particular biosimilars. Poland's government wants to establish a knowledge-based economy in the country. So it sees biotechnology, in which bio- pharmaceuticals is the fastest growing segment in Poland, as one way of doing this. In academia, the country already has a number of centers of expertise in biotechnology which gives it a relatively active R&D platform in the discipline and, above all, the teaching capacity for producing a steady stream of graduates in biotechnology. The country currently has around 8000 biotech students and 1300 graduates in the subject. There are 21 university biotechnology faculties, seven of which offer doctoral studies in the discipline. The government is trying to exploit this human capital in bio- technology by offering investment grants for biotech projects on the basis of the number of jobs being created and the amount of R&D which will be conducted. In addition, the EU is offering financial support for biotech projects to aid development in regions like the CEE. Along with several other Eastern European countries, Poland joined the EU in 2004. Currently there are around 70 biotechnology companies in Poland, most of them in biopharmaceuticals and diagnostics, with annual revenues of around $100 million. The majority are located in emerging clusters in Warsaw, Lublin, Krakow, Wro- claw, Poznan, and Gdansk, where there are universities and re- search institutes specializing in life sciences and biotechnology. Most of the biopharmaceutical companies are concentrating on the discovery and development of new drugs as well as small- scale contract manufacturing. A few are dedicating themselves to the development and production of their own biopharmaceu-ticals, above all biosimilars. \"Biosimilars have better prospects since Poland has a chance to specialize in this area rather than in purely innovative biotech products,\" says Monika Stefanczyk, head pharmaceutical market analyst at PMR Ltd., a Polish market research company. The three main players in the fledgling biosimilars sector are Mabion, formed five years ago by a consortium of four phar- maceutical and two research companies, Polpharma, Poland's largest domestic pharmaceutical producer, and Bioton Group, which has been active in setting up foreign partnerships. Mabion, whose R&D work at its Lodz site has been aided by EU funding, is working on several projects, mostly oncology treatments. Two are monoclonal antibody drugs which the company believes will assist it in gaining a foothold in a world market for humanized monoclonal antibodies predicted to be worth $60 billion by 2015. Mabion has a proprietary technology, which it claims enables it to make the drugs 30 to 40 % cheaper than conventional meth- ods. Polpharma, which has formed a specialist unit, Polpharma Biologics, for the development and production of biological products, was scheduled to open a laboratory in the first quarter of this year in Gdansk. The laboratory includes scale-up equip- ment for production of clinical trial batches and a pilot plant. Warsaw-based Bioton signed a \u20ac55.5 million ($73 million) deal with the Icelandic generic-drug company Actavis in February for the development and manufacture of recombinant human insulin (RHI) products, which Actavis will market throughout Europe and in the US. Just how many other Polish companies join these three front-runners in biopharmaceuticals could de- pend on the availability of private funds to supplement public- sector finance. \"Access to private money is a bit easier but it is still difficult to find investors willing to put money into biotechnology,\" says Marcin Los, chief executive of Phage Consulting, in Gdansk, which is encouraging the development of a niche bacteriophage segment in Poland. Biotechnology scientists and entrepreneurs in Polish biotechnology, including in biopharmaceuticals, claim that another barrier is proposals to tighten up the country's already restrictive legislation on genetically modified organisms (GMO). \"Planned amendments to the regulations fail to take into ac- count the ability of GMO research to be carried out in labs in controlled conditions without any risks to the environment,\" says Professor Tomasz Twardowski, vice-president of the Pol- ish Federation of Biotechnology. \"The new rules handicap Polish biotechnology in comparison to regulatory conditions in other countries. The Polish government is responding to public opin- ion hostile to GMOs rather than taking note of the scientific evidence.\" Polish biotech companies argue that the government cannot have it both ways. It cannot expect to have a thriving bio- tech sector while having legislation which hampers its activities. Sean Milmo is a freelance writer based in the UK .

How important is it to respond to an FDA-483 within 15 days? A. It has always been in a com- pany's interest to respond in writing to an FDA-483, List of Inspectional Ob-servations, issued at the conclusion of their inspec- tion. In so doing, the inspected company demonstrates to FDA that it understands the inspectional observations and that it is committed to implementation of cor-rective and preventive action. A thought-ful, complete, and timely response estab-lishes credibility with FDA. On Aug. 9, 2009, FDA Commis- sioner Margaret Hamburg delivered a landmark enforcement speech at the Food and Drug Law Institute. In this speech, she outlined her vision for a strong FDA and, more specifically, her new enforcement initiatives, stating, \"First, the FDA will set post-inspection deadlines. When the FDA finds that a firm is significantly out of compliance, we expect a prompt response to our findings. Once the FDA provides in-spection findings identifying a serious problem, the firm will generally have no more than 15 working days in which to respond before the FDA moves ahead with a warning letter or enforcement action. This will help FDA issue warn-ing letters on a timely basis and facili-tate prompt corrective action.\" Two days later, FDA formalized this aspect of its new enforcement initiatives in the Federal Register (1). Fully aligned with the Commissioner's speech, the agency outlined its intent to support public-health protection by facilitating the timely issuance of Warning Letters and the establishment of a timeframe for the submission and agency review of postinspection responses. Very clearly, FDA stated it will not ordinarily delay the issuance of a Warning Letter in order to review an FDA-483 response that is received by FDA more than 15 business days after the inspection concluded. FDA, at its discretion, may issue Warning Letters at any time, indepen-dent of receiving a response. The Warn-ing Letter serves two purposes within FDA: to give firms the opportunity to promptly and voluntarily correct defi-ciencies; and to establish prior notice, which FDA considers when pursuing subsequent enforcement actions. As a general rule, the agency should not issue a Warning Letter if the agency concludes, through review of the response and sup-porting evidence, that the violations that would have supported the letter have been corrected. However, ongoing or promised corrective actions generally do not preclude the issuance of a Warning Letter (see FDA's 2011 Regulatory Proce-dures Manual, Chapter 4) (2). Of course it's optimal to ensure that operations remain in compliance at all times, precluding significant FDA-483 observations and subsequent enforce-ment actions, and assuring only high quality, safe, and effective products are produced and distributed to the market. When faced, however, with an FDA in-spection that results in an FDA-483, be sure to promptly initiate corrective ac-tions and be sure to respond in writing within 15 days of issuance. FDA may issue Warning Letters at any time, independent of receiving a response. The agency will consider the firm's re- sponse to be thoughtful review and implementation of systemic correc-tive actions in related areas and even at other related facilities under a cor-porate umbrella t\u0001\u0001JODMVEFT \u0001BQQSPQSJBUF \u0001FWJEFODF \u0001UIBU\u0001 completed t\u0001\u0001JEFOUJGJFT \u0001UIF\u0001UJNFGSBNF \u0001GPS\u0001DPNQMFUJPO \u0001 of other corrective actions and in a time-frame that is both aggressive and realistic \u0001UP\u0001QSFWFOU \u0001SFDVSSFODF \u0001 of the observation.

M ost PET drugs, which are used for imaging, are given paren terally, and produced by aseptic process- ing. PET drugs came under the auspic es of FDA rela tively recen tly, with the passage of the 1997 F ood and Drug Administra tion Moderniza tion Act, and minimum cGMP standards for this class of drugs were established in 2009. A guidance for preparing new drug applica tions and abbrevia ted new drug applica tions fo r PET drugs was issued in March 2011, and in commen ts to the March 2011 guidance and in questions raised at the public meeting, stakeholders request ed that FDA provide guidance on media fills for valida tion of aseptic prepara tion fo r PET drugs. This most recen t guidance is designed to help manufac turers of PET drugs comply with FDA regula tions. A media fill is a simula tion of the aseptic process in which vials are filled with microbial grow th medium instead of drug pr oduc t to test whether the aseptic procedures are adequa te to preven t contamina tion during actual drug produc tion. The guidance docu - ment outlines the design of a media fill simula tion, describes an example of an appropria te grow th medium that can be used , and recommends how often a media fill should be done. In addition, the documen t provides guidance for qualifying grow th media, includ - ing the performance of grow th promot ion tests to test whether the medium is capable of suppor ting micr obial grow th. Finally, the guidance describes positive controls for the media fill simula tion.On Mar. 29, 2012, tion (GPhA) reit- erated its call to move forward with user -fee pr oposals for generic drugs and biosimilar produc ts. \"The generic industry has stepped up to do our part to help ensure US drug safety, establish a more level playing field among all partici- pants in the US pharmaceu tical supply chain, and sig nifican tly reduce the time needed to commercialize a generic drug, \" said David Gaugh, GPhA vice-presiden t for regula tory sciences in a statemen t. Gaugh testified before the Sena te Committ ee on Health, Educa tion, Labor, and Pensions on Mar. 29, 2012, in suppor t of generic -drug and biosimi - lar user -fe e programs. \"The [user -fee] programs will help assure that American consumers continue to receive the significan t cost savings from generics that, over the past dozen years, have provided more than $1 trillion in sa vings to the nation's healthcare system,\" he said. The proposed user -fee programs were developed last year through collabora tion among GP hA, FDA, and other stakeholders. Under the Generic D rug User Fee Act (GDUFA), the generic -drug industry ag reed to pay $299 million annually in user fees for the next five years, beginning O ct. 1, 2012. This funding is supplemen tal to what Congress appropria tes to FDA each year and will enable FDA' s Office of Generic D rugs to hire additional scien tific r esources needed to provide timely approval of generic drugs. The new fees also will provide increased funding for generic -drug manufac turer facility inspec tions, noted GPhA in its statemen t. In his testimony, G augh noted that, of the $299 million per y ear that FDA will receive over the five-year GDUFA program, 80% (or appro ximately finished- dose manufac - turers, and the remaining 20% will be paid by API manufac turers. Thirty percen t of the funding will stem from applica tion fees, and 70% will be deriv ed from fees on manufac turing sites or facility fees.\"Splitting the fees in this manner will provide the FDA wit h a pre- dictable source of annual income, as the number of facilities manu - facturing generic drugs on a yearly basis pr ovides a more consistent figure than the number of generic drug applica tions submitt ed,\" he said. \"Finished dose ture both generic and brand medica tions will be required to pay both a Prescript ion Drug User Fee Act facility fe e and a GDUFA facilit y fee.\" GDUFA also calls for performance goals for FDA. As part of these goals, GDUFA calls for the agency to complet e, by the end of year five, the review of 90% of all generic -drug applica tions (i.e., abbrevia drug applica tions [ ANDAs]) for those ANDA s pending as of Oct. 1, 2012, the proposed starting date for the program. In addition, by the end of the program 's fifth year, GDUFA calls on FDA t o review 90% of ANDA s within 10 mon ths after they ar e submitt ed. In his testimony, Gaugh said more than 2700 generic -drug applica tions are awaiting approval from FDA' s Office of Generic D rugs, and the average approv - al time for an applica tion is appro ximately 30 mon ths. GPhA also ts a pr oposed program that creates a separa te review platform for biosimilar sponsors, to be financed annually through $20 million of the funds appropria ted to FDA and supple - mented by user fees equivalen t to those under the Prescript ion Drug User Fee Act. A por tion of the applica tion fe e paid during the biosimilar developmen t phase will be used to suppor t earlier resourc - ing for produc t reviews. Similar to GDUFA, the program also includes performance goals for FDA, which calls for the agency, by the end of the pr ogram 's fifth year, to review 90% of the original biosimilar appli - cations it receives within 10 mon ths of its submission.More than Filling.

P fizer retained its number one position of the top company of US prescription drug sales, and the generic - drug company Teva Pharmac eutical moved into the top-five com - panies of US prescription drug sales. Total healthcare system spending on medicines in the US reached $320 billion in 2011, up 3.7% in nominal terms or 0.5% on a real- per-capita basis, according to a re cen t repor t by the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informa tics. Branded medicines spending grew 2.2% on a nominal basis and reflec ted the impac t of $14. 9 billion lower spend - ing on produc ts that lost their patent exclusivity. In 2011, spending fo r brands launched within the past two years was $12. 2 billion, compared with $8.5 billion in the year -earlier period. Spending on generic drugs, which now accoun t for 80% percen t of dispensed prescript ions, increased $5. 6 billion in 2011, according to IMS. Ov erall spending on medicines continued to be concen trated on traditional small-molecule oral pills dispensed through retail pharmacies, even as specialt y drugs and biologics experienced higher grow th. Overall per-capita-use of medicines in the US declined sligh tly in 2011, as ph ysician office visits and nonemergency -room hospital admissions dropped, and older Americans reduced their retail drug use, according to IMS. The number of office visits declined 4 .7% while emergency -room admissions, which are relatively small in number, rose 7.4%. Retail pr escript ion usage declined on average 1 .1% in 2011 and fell by more than 3% in ten states, reflec ting varia tions in demo - graphics, epidemiology, clinical practice, and payer dynamics. Seniors age 65 and over reduced their use of prescript ion drugs by 3.1% last year, most notably in the antih ypertensive class. Individuals age 19 to 25 increased their use of medicines by 2.0%, notably for attention deficit hyperac tivity disorder treatments and antidepressan ts. This was the only age group that increased drug utilization in 2011. Nearly one-thir d of total healthcare spending was concen trated in five therapy areas: oncology, asthma and chronic obstructive pul-monary disease, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and mental health, accord - ing to IMS. Each of these therap y areas grew faster than the overall market and exhibited a range of dynamics related to new treatment option usage and growing diagnosis of the related disease. Product sales and company rankings On a produc t basis, Pfizer 's anticholest erol drug Lipitor (atorvastatin) retained its position as the top-selling drug in the US in 2011 wit h sales of $7. 7 billion, according to data from IMS. B ristol-Myers Squibb 's and Sanofi 's antiplatelet drug Pla vix (clopidogrel) was second with US sales of $6. 8 billion. A straZeneca 's Nexium (esomeprazol) , a drug to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease, was third with US sales of $6. 2 billion. B ristol-Myers Squibb 's Abilify (aripipraz ole), an antipsychot ic and antidepressan t, came in fourth with US sales of $5. 2 billion, and GlaxoSmithKine's Advair Diskus (fluticasone and salmeterol), a drug to treat asthma, was fifth with US sales of $4. 6 billion.

P h a r m a c i s t s , healthcare companies, and some consume r groups are backing the agency's new cam - paign to authorize certain over-the-counte r (OTC) drugs with special \"conditions fo r safe use,\" such as access to electronic infor - mation and special assistance from phar - macists. Whereas OTC medicines primar - ily treat acute, short-term conditions, FD A officials are touting this \"new paradigm\" a s a way to approve nonprescription meds fo r common chronic diseases, with the hel p of systems that assist patients in assessin g their health and response to medicatio n over longer terms . FDA is considering whether \"ther e should be more flexibility in the concep t of nonprescription drugs,\" explained Jane t Woodcock, director of FDA's Center fo r Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) , during a two-day public hearing held i n March by FDA to gain stakeholder inpu t on the proposal. To approve an OTC ther - apy, FDA currently seeks evidence fro m manufacturers that the medicine can b e used safely and appropriately based o n the approved \"drugs facts box\" label an d common knowledge. Now, FDA is explor - ing whether additional information fro m pharmacists and health IT systems coul d sufficiently augment consumer under -standing of how to select and use a dru g appropriately without going to a doctor . Expanding authority Such a change, Woodcock acknowledged , will require a lengthy rule-making pro - cess; legislation also is needed for FDA t o permit simultaneous marketing of bot h prescription and nonprescription ver - sions of the same drug. Manufacturer s could implement \"safe use\" provision s voluntarily, but would be disadvantage d because FDA cannot compel competi - tors to adopt procedures not listed on th e product label. There is talk of includin g authorizing language for this approac h in this year's user-fee renewal legislation , but the desire to avoid any proposals tha t could delay Congressional action is likel y to put the topic aside for the short term . The rationale for expanded OTC dru g access is that the cost and inconvenienc e of visiting a doctor to obtain a prescriptio n deters many people from treating commo n health conditions\u2014and from adherenc e to recommended therapy after treatmen t begins. There's strong evidence from th e literature over the past 20 years that pre - scription-to-OTC switches for vaginal an - tifungals, allergy treatments, and heartbur n medicines, among others, have promote d effective self-care. Testing innovative non -prescription products has improved meth - ods for conducting label-comprehensio n studies and actual-use trials as well . Yet, Merck failed several times to gai n OTC status for its anticholesterol dru g Mevacor (lovastatin), largely because FD A was not convinced that consumers coul d determine whether a cholesterol drug wa s right for them just by reading the produc t label. FDA has tried to handle with suc h situations by establishing a third categor y of \"behind-the-counter\" drugs availabl e from pharmacists, as with the Plan B morning-after pill. However, manufac - turers generally object to creating a thir d class of drugs or simultaneous market - ing of a prescription and nonprescriptio n product for fear that such options wil l confuse consumers . Under FDA's new paradigm, manufac - turers would ensure \"safe use\" of a medi - cine by using new IT programs and mor e home-use diagnostics to enhance an d document individual understanding of ap - propriate drug use. Information kiosks an d other IT aides in pharmacies, for example , could direct consumers through self-diag - nosis information programs that check fo r risk factors contraindicating treatment an d monitor continued safe use . Doctors objec t The most vocal opposition to more flexibl e nonprescription drug regulation come s from the American Medical Associatio n (AMA).

Backed by biotech companies, the legislation exempts early stage firms from complying with certain Securities & Exchange Commission reporting requirements and disclosure policies. Supporters say it will help innovative biotech companies develop new prod- ucts, while critics fear it will expose na\u00efve investors to risky offerings. Electronic submission standards A slightly obscure provision in the new Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) agreement requires electronic filing of all applications for new drugs and biologics and supplements. The pol-icy will become mandatory over the next five years, and electronic submissions will have to adhere to mandatory FDA guidances that set standards for clinical data terminology in collaboration with industry and open standards develop-ment organizations. Draft guidance on standards and electronic formats is due by the end of the year, and final guid-ance is expected a year after the end of a public comment period. This tight timeframe is spurring FDA and industry collaboration through the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) and the Pharmaceutical Users Software Exchange (PhUSE), which have formed working groups on issues for reporting and sharing clinical and preclinical data. Legislation to support drug innovation There's a swarm of bills in Congress that aim to speed important new therapies to patients, all hoping to jump onto pend-ing user fee legislation. The Transforming the Regulatory Environment to Acceler-ate Access to Treatments (TREAT) Act (S. 2113) would accelerate FDA reviews by permitting scientific experts with conflicts of interest to serve on advisory committees, providing sponsors with ex- planations from FDA for application re-jections, and enhancing FDA capabilities to advance medical innovation. The Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) Act (H.R. 2182) seeks to spur development of new therapies to combat drug-resistant bacteria by of- fering manufacturers added exclusivity for innovative drugs and for medicines paired with companion diagnostics, while also authorizing FDA use of pri-ority review and fast-track approval for these products. Similarly, the rare-dis-ease community backs the Faster Ac-cess to Specialized Treatments (FAST) Act (H.R. 4132), which codifies FDA's accelerated-approval process. Taking a different tack, the Patients' Access to Treatments Act (HR. 4209) aims to make costly specialty drugs more affordable to patients by limiting cost-sharing practices by health plans and payers. The bipartisan bill has sup-port from biotech manufacturers and would curb copayments and coinsurance for high-cost therapies that treat chronic and life-threatening conditions. Testing TB treatments Research organizations and interna-tional health agencies are advancing the development of new therapies to stem the spread of lethal multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) strains. Most current treatments are more than 40 years old and have lost effectiveness, but important ad-vances in understanding treatment effects and more robust TB drug pipelines have generated optimism for progress. The TB Alliance recently launched clinical trials for a novel combination drug regi-men that promises shorter, more effective treatment of the disease. FDA is support-ing these efforts with new guidance on developing combination therapies and a proposal to permit faster approval of new TB diagnostics.FTC permits PBM merger After months of analysis and heated lob- bying, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) approved the $29-billion purchase of Medco Health Solutions by Express Scripts last month, creating a new leader among pharmacy benefits management companies (PBMs). Retail pharmacists protested vehemently that the deal will lead to more mail-order drug sales and tighter dispensing fees, but the FTC deter-mined that the purchase won't limit com-petition for PBM contracts, even for dis-tribution of high-cost specialty therapies. Biotech manufacturers may face tighter contract negotiations with the combined firm, but not anticompetitive behavior. Even so, leading chain and independent pharmacies have filed a lawsuit to block the combination as a threat to the corner drug store and consumers. Warning to stem-cell manufacturer In its first Warning Letter to a stem-cell manufacturer, FDA cited ItelliCell Biosci-ences of New York City in a Mar. 13, 2012, letter for doing much more than \"mini-mal manipulation\" of adipose tissue cells extracted from patients for autologous use, activity that requires a biologics li-cense from the agency. FDA inspectors, moreover, found significant deviations from good manufacturing practices, in-cluding failure to test each batch, to main-tain laboratory controls, to establish writ-ten procedures and a quality control unit, and to respond to FDA's citations. The next step could be seizure or injunction.

That situation could change, however, if healthcare plans decide to cover third-class medicines in certain cases. In addition, patient outlays for OTCs would be offset in part by eliminating the need for doctor visits. Pharmaceutical manufacturers could benefit from increased sales of nonpre-scription products, but are keeping fairly quiet about these prospects, par-ticularly about the role of switches in retaining market share for a brand fac-ing competition from generic or other new therapies. At the FDA meeting, CHPA president Scott Melville highlighted how OTC medicines save billions of dollars for the healthcare system overall and provide relief to millions of Americans. Melville also urged retaining a \"clear distinction\" between prescription and non-prescrip-tion drugs, and that FDA should approve OTCs under its proposed paradigm in-dividually and based on scientific data. Generic-drug makers support OTCs in general, but not necessarily switches that make it harder to enter a market; barriers could emerge if FDA approves an OTC with safe-use provisions that apply to all similar products. Drug distributors also are uneasy about OTCs with special conditions for safe use that limit product distribution to certain pharmacies or retail outlets. The Health-care Distribution Management Association urged FDA to adopt standardized processes for requiring distributors to determine which pharmacies and customers may receive a particular nonprescription drug. Pharmacists excited Pharmacists are most enthusiastic about FDA's new paradigm as a way to \"optimize the important role pharmacists can play in improving public health,\" said Thomas Menighan, CEO of the American Phar-macists Association. He and others cited pharmacists' success in administering vaccines to millions of individuals and in forming collaborative practice agreements with local physicians to check blood pres-sure and order tests related to specific medication management programs. They also point to \"rescue medicines,\" such as asthma inhalers and epinephrine to block allergic reactions, as ready candidates for enhanced pharmacy access. However, pharmacists emphasize that they will need additional compensation for providing extra clinical services as part of safe use conditions.

At the same time, retail pharmacists prefer to limit expanded access programs to bonafide pharmacies, as opposed to the thousands of retail outlets that sell OTC medicines. And pharmacists working in hospitals and for healthcare systems have expressed that they are well-positioned to participate in special safe-use programs Not surprising, IT and research firms are eager to provide a range of technol-ogy to support these efforts. They are proposing new ways to evaluate and ensure compliance with self-diagnostic tools, to devise collaborative programs that enhance care management, and to coordinate follow-up and oversight in collaboration with physicians, payers, and patients. Manufacturers also are ex-ploring such systems, such as testing by GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare of an interactive drug facts kiosk to help consumers self-determine the need for and suitability of using statins to reduce cholesterol. The program, explained GSK Vice-President David Schifkovitz, could run on a home computer or smart phone and produce a personal recommendation regarding treatment. Considering contraception An interesting side issue to the debate is whether enhanced access to medicines without a prescription could defuse the current hostilities over contraception coverage. A number of women's health organizations applauded FDA's para-digm at the hearing as a way to promote \"reproductive freedom\" for women by facilitating access to safe and effective birth control methods. Eleanor Schwarz, director of the Center for Research on Health Care, described studies showing that women can use an IT kiosk to per-form self-screening for Chlamydia and for oral contraceptive. Given that most healthcare plans do not pay for nonpre-scription medicines, access to OTC oral contraceptives makes moot the debate over whether religious-affiliated organi-zations should reimburse for birth con-trol pills. Of course, any move by FDA to authorize nonprescription contracep-tives would launch a wave of objections from physicians and family planning op-ponents\u2014similar to what happened last December when FDA proposed to drop OTC limitations for Plan B. To move forward with this initiative, policymakers need to devise appropriate exclusivity arrangements and other incen-tives for manufacturers to invest in inno-vative information and patient monitoring systems. In addition, methods for testing the efficacy of patient self-selection pro-grams need to be validated. Despite these and other obstacles, Woodcock and others appear optimistic that this new approach not only could enhance medication use, but also identify drug-drug interactions and improve pharmacovigilance tracking. Although efforts to expand nonprescrip-tion drug use in the past have failed, the advent of electronic medical records and smart phones may create a more positive atmosphere for change.

With this growth and recent concerns about drug shortages, should there be concern about the availability of biomanufacturing capacity? Capacity utilization BioProcess Technology Consultant's (BPTC) analysis shows that overall biomanufacturing capacity utilization rates have remained low despite bio-pharmaceutical product growth and the associated requirement for increasing mammalian cell-culture capacity (1). Currently, there are nearly 3 million li-ters of mammalian cell-culture capacity globally, controlled mostly by product companies that do not typically offer contract manufacturing. Overall capac- ity is forecast to grow to approximately 4.3 million liters by 2016. According to BPTC's analysis, while increasing de-mand for biopharmaceuticals will drive utilization rates higher, growth in capac-ity will be more than sufficient to meet the projected demand through 2016. The dramatic increase in volumetric productivity in biopharmaceutical pro-cesses, particularly for producing mono-clonal antibodies (mAbs), also contributes to lower capacity utilization rates. Several groups have reported titers of mAbs of 10 g/L and higher (2). These higher prod-uct titers, however, are not yet routinely achieved on a commercial scale. A con-sequence of higher process productivity is that the volume of production bioreactors in newer facilities is likely to be significantly smaller (i.e., 2000-5000 L scale) rather than the current volume (i.e.,10,000-20,000 L) typical in many com-mercial biomanufac-turing facilities. As the scale of production bioreactors decreases, more companies are considering build-ing capacity based on single-use bioreactor technology instead of stainless steel-based equipment. These newer facilities with smaller bioreactors will be capable of producing the same quantities of product as current large-scale facilities, but will still require significant space and equip-ment to handle downstream processing requirements. Forecasting capacity and demand To measure the impact of improvements in expression levels on the global demand for cell-culture capacity, BPTC performed a sensitivity analysis on the forecast volu-metric capacity requirements based on changes in product titers. For this analysis, we varied the range of titers (and resulting overall process yields) for each product in our database from 0.5 times the baseline value to twice the baseline. Thus, if the baseline titer for a particular product is 1.2 g/L, the impact of titers ranging from 0.6 g/L to 2.4 g/L on the volumetric de-mand for that product was examined. The results showed that at the lower end of the productivity scale, approximately 4.2 mil-lion liters of cell-culture capacity would be required to meet demand for each product in our database (see Figure 1). At expression levels two times the baseline value, only 2 million liters of cell-culture capacity would be required. In examining the impact of higher titers on volumetric de-mand, we assumed that the downstream recovery and purification yields for each product remained unchanged and that the downstream portion of facilities was capable of supporting production at the increased titer levels. BPTC understands that the concern for a potential capacity shortage is real; however, we do not believe that an overall capacity shortage is imminent. Although utilization rates are forecast to increase during the coming five-year period, a similar shortage that was seen with Enbrel in the early 2000s is not likely to occur as there is a reasonable amount of underuti-lized capacity through 2016.

These complex, long- term delivery products aim to reduce the number of injections a patient needs, for example, moving from once-a-day to once-a-month or less frequently. ER injectables can also ease patient compliance and relapse. They are most often used to treat pain management, drug and alcohol addictions, psycho-logical and behavioral conditions (e.g., schizophrenia and depression), fertility, diabetes, and certain cancers. One dominant type of an ER inject- able product is polymer-based. This type includes microspheres, implants, and gels. These systems rely on diffu-sion through a polymer as well as ero-sion of that polymer to control release of the API. Another type involves con-jugating a releasable chemical moiety to the active drug, thereby making a prodrug that is less soluble for slow uptake, or is slower to clear from the body. And another type would be in-soluble salts. According to Heidi Mansour, PhD, an assistant professor in the College of Pharmacy at the University of Kentucky and editorial advisory board member of Pharmaceutical Technology , these types of products are become more popular to manufacture because \"scientific ad-vances in polymer science and bioma-terials have given rise to biocompatible and biodegradable polymers (e.g., vari-ous diblock and triblock copolymers) that offer a wide range in their temporal degradation profiles. As a result, there is a wide range in the temporal profiles of drug release for a wider range of drugs.\" In addition, she notes that, \"there have been scientific and technological ad-vances in particle engineering design methods, and in nanotechnology and tangible application to nanopharma-ceuticals and nanomedicines.\" Extended-release injectables are considered to be complex dosage forms by the regulatory authorities. These products bring key challenges to the manufacturing process, including: sterility assurance, the number of unit operations required, as well as compa-rability and control strategy concerns. Pharmaceutical Technology spoke to experts engaged in the development and manufacture of ER injectables to dig deeper into these challenges and to offer potential solutions. Participating in the article are: Paul Herbert, vice-president of process de-velopment at Alkermes; Andrew J. Thiel, PhD, an associate research fellow, and David M. Loffredo, PhD, a director, both in Pharmaceutical Research and Development at Hospira; Mary Stick-elmeyer, a research fellow with Eli Lilly and Company; and Arthur J. Tipton, PhD, head of Birmingham Laboratories within Evonik's Healthcare Pharma Polymers product line. Sterilization PharmTech: ER injectables cannot be ter- minally sterilized. Why is this the case, and what types of sterilization should be used instead? (Herbert, Alkermes): The challenge with terminal sterilization is that the physical and chemical stability of the materials used ER injectables\u2014drug and polymers\u2014do not generally with-stand the temperatures required to ef-fect terminal sterilization. Terminal sterilization utilizes high tempera-tures or radiation to make the prod-uct sterile. These conditions are likely to affect the API, creating some level of impurities. For polymer-based ER injectables, these high temperatures would melt the polymer, and radiation Meeting Manufacturing Challenges Tied to Extended-Release fort Z one P11-351 8A/R1- Apr., 12Our com fort z one is lyophilization t\u0001Lyophilization cycle development and product formulation optimization t\u0001\u0001State -of-the-art lab scale, cGMP clinical and commercial scale lyophilizers t\u0001cGMP analytical and stability testing, and full regulatory support t\u0001Over 50 scientists working for you, half of whom have an advanced degreeParenteral Contract Manufact uring Service of Hospira Discover your com fort zone at one2onecmo.com Get your custom report online or contact One 2 One.

Aseptic processing is therefore used to produce sterile product in tempera-ture- and radiation-sensitive products. Process equipment is steam sterilized-in-place, and ingredients entering the process pass through sterilizing filters that remove any organisms that might be in the ingredients. The majority of the processing takes place in closed equipment to prevent human contact. Media simulations are conducted to demonstrate that sterile product can be made in the process equipment. (Thiel and Loffredo, Hospira): When terminal sterilization by autoclaving is not possible, the next default steril-ization approach is sterile filtration fol-lowed by aseptic filling, as noted. How-ever, some types of ER injectables are also unable to be filter-sterilized. For example, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticle ER formulations cannot be filter-sterilized because the diameter of the PLGA microparticles exceeds the pore size of a sterilizing-grade filter (0.2 g). These micropar- ticle formulations require specialized manufacturing with sterile compound-ing and processing. Stickelmeyer (Lilly): It is correct that terminal sterilization by heat, chemi-cal agents, or radiation is not recom-mended. Typically, ER formulations containing polymers may be sus-ceptible to degradation at elevated temperatures due to the low glass- transition temperature of the polymers, thus making heat sterilization difficult. Ready-to-use suspension formulations may be able to withstand an autoclave cycle; however, heat treatments of aqueous suspensions may accelerate hydrolysis reactions, flocculation, or Ostwald ripening and, thus, in many cases are not suitable. For chemical sterilization by gases, there are concerns about achieving adequate sterility and minimizing residual gas levels. Ionizing radiation may be feasible for solid particulate formulations (either gamma or elec-tron beam) but may not be appropriate for biologics or for polymeric formula-tions because the radiation may affect polymer properties (e.g., cross-linking, degradation) that impact drug release. Development of electron-beam ster- ilization cycles that expose the prod-uct to a higher energy\u2014yet shorter processing times\u2014may minimize the impact on release properties and long-term chemical and physical stability. Lower irradiation doses based on bio-burden level may also provide required sterility assurance while reducing im-pact on chemical and physical stability. Sterilizing filtration can be success- fully applied to smaller particulate de-livery systems but may not be feasible for larger particulate systems. In these cases, aseptic processing of sterile subsystems can be complex and increase risk. Tipton (Evonik): The notion that ER injectables cannot be terminally ster-ilized is not universally true. If both the active and the excipients used in an ER formulation can withstand ion-izing radiation independently\u2014and combined in the dosage form\u2014a ter-minal sterilization process can be de-veloped and validated. However, many ER injectables are more complex and cannot handle radiation sterilization. This may be due to a complex active such as a protein that is susceptible to chain scission, oxidation degradation, disulfide bond rupture, or changes in conformation. Also, some of the for-mulation materials may be susceptible to radiation (i.e., they may undergo chain scission). In some cases, the for-mulation can be engineered to handle this decrease in polymer molecular weight. Finally, there may be complex interactions between formulation in-gredients that can lead to instability. Unit operations PharmTech: Compared with a simple so- lution or lyophilized formulation, what additional unit operations are required for ER injectables and why? (Herbert, Alkermes): Manufacture of ER injectables usually consists of a pro-cess to manufacture the ER injectable microspheres or crystals and then the more traditional process of filling into vials or syringes. The steps required to produce a polymer particulate-based ER injectable include: encapsulation, extraction of solvent from the parti-cle, isolation of the particles\u2014usually by filtration, drying of the particles to remove residual solvent and ensure physical stability of the particle, and filling of the particles and sealing in a sterile vial for storage prior to use. These steps are required in addition to compounding to avoid putting stabil-ity and drug-release characteristics at risk All steps must take place within a \"sterile core\" to ensure the product is in fact sterile, and each operation requires a sterile validation effort. The latter can be challenging when solid particles are being made and manipulated. (Thiel and Loffredo, Hospira): The ad- ditional unit operations depend on the type of ER formulation. In the case of PLGA microparticle for-mulations, these have tradition-ally been prepared using a double- emulsion technique. Briefly, the active ingredient is dissolved in an aqueous solution, and this solution is filter-ster-ilized. Separately, the PLGA polymer is dissolved in a water-immiscible or-ganic solvent, and this solution is also filter-sterilized. The two phases are then combined with high-shear mixing or homogenization to prepare a water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion. This primary emulsion is diluted into a larger vol-ume of another, outer aqueous phase with high-shear mixing to form the secondary emulsion (W/O/W). Then, there is a solvent-removal step to harden the newly-formed PLGA Extended-release injectables are considered to be complex dosage forms by the regulatory authorities. model Story: Parenterals microspheres, and filtration (sieving) and rinsing steps to isolate PLGA mi-crospheres of the desired size distri-bution while rinsing away everything else. Finally, the microspheres are dried (bulk lyophilization) and ster-ile powder filled. If this procedure is used, the additional unit operations compared with traditional parenteral manufacturing are the sterile emulsi-fication, solvent removal, and particle-harvesting operations. Bulk drying and sterile powder filling are also special-ized operations. There are other methods for prepar- ing PLGA microparticles (e.g., spray drying), that would have entirely dif-ferent unit operations. For in-situ gel forming ER formulations, the manu-facturing operations are more tradi-tional, but may require specialized filling to handle viscous solutions. Tipton (Evonik): Additional unit opera- tions required are specific to the final dosage form. So for microspheres, commonly an emulsion step as well as a sieving and drying step are required. For liposomes, either an extrusion or homogenization step is added. If the product is a conjugate such as a PEGylated protein, an additional syn-thesis step is required. An implant will require a melt extrusion. Although these unit operations may be complex and add cost to individual products, they are the necessary steps to obtain the ER as compared with the conventional dose. The additional manufacturing cost is more than made up in the additional benefit and value of the resulting ER product. Release profile and control strategy PharmTech: What additional compara- bility concerns need to be addressed so that the release profile of these prod-ucts is not affected? (Herbert, Alkermes): Scale-up is associ- ated with significant attention to com-parability. Any changes in scale or unit operations are subject to significant regulatory oversight and require buy-in from the various regulatory bodies. Comparability becomes especially im-portant when a change of manufactur-ing site is considered. Finally, having a good handle on the long-term stabil-ity of a product and its performance characteristics is a key component of comparability analysis over time. The key performance aspect, the extended release, is critically important because any loss of control or drift of release rate is potentially impactful: if, for ex- ample, the release rate increases over time on storage, such a change would be cause for concern about durability of efficacy and/or safety of the drug. Stickelmeyer (Lilly): Ideally, during de- velopment of an ER injectable product, an appropriate in-vitro assay can be developed that correlates with animal and human pharmacokinetic studies. In addition, consideration of orthogo-nal methods to characterize critical quality attributes such as particle size, for instance, is highly desirable to con-firm that changes during development have not impacted the release profile. Tipton (Evonik): In all cases of new for- mulations, stability data is needed. In some cases, the new dosage form may be more stable as compared with an immediate-release formulation. For example, a drug that has been sup-plied as a ready-to-inject solution may be more stable when formulated into a solid crystalline drug form in a mi-crosphere. It is possible that the new formulation may present new stability issues. For example, perhaps an ingre-dient is a polymer with a low glass-transition temperature. So accelerated stability at elevated temperature may not be possible. Or, a novel formula-tion may be a suspension and addi-tional data may need to be developed on the settling characteristics of that suspension. Also, items that may not have been important in the immediate-release formulation may be important in the ER formulation. For example, conventional syringes are lubricated with silicone oil. This small amount of silicone oil may interact with the formulation and result in unexpected properties, such as plasticizing a poly-mer used in the ER formulation. PharmTech: What considerations do manufacturers need to keep in mind when developing and carrying out a control strategy for these products? Stickelmeyer (Lilly): The technical risks encountered during development of complex, ER parenteral dosage forms can be addressed by incorporating a thorough understanding of the product quality attributes into the formulation and process design. This, in turn, will result in a robust manufacturing con-trol strategy. For example, understand-ing the release mechanism (e.g., mo-lecular weight of polymers, diffusive, and degradation properties) is critical to ensuring that there is no unintended or burst release. The use of orthogonal techniques during development to fully characterize the formulation and pro-cess design space should be considered to assess the impact of changes in for-mulation, primary packaging, process and/or devices. Data should be tied to clinical data to ensure that safety and efficacy are maintained. Development of discriminating in-vitro tests may require nontradi- tional approaches such as a modified flow-through cell with low flow rates. With ER rates, the test may need to be performed over a long time period and thus include measures to minimize evaporation and assure stability of the active ingredient during the test pe-riod. Sufficient time points that char-acterize the release profile should be obtained. Multiple tests may need to be developed including a quality control These extra unit operations may be complex and add cost to individual products, but they are the necessary steps to obtain the extended release.46 Pharmaceutical Technology MAY 2012 PharmTech.comCover Story: Parenterals test for release, an accelerated release to assess safety, and a test for assessing comparability for changes that reflects the actual release period. Finally, an understanding of inher- ent microbial activity of the formula-tion and the impact of processing and hold times should be assessed. As-sessment of equipment and facilities for acceptable microbial and extrinsic particulate control should also be per-formed. Tipton (Evonik): There will certainly be additional analytical methods required for an ER product. Most importantly, a method will be needed to confirm the extended release. A product that claims one-month duration, has to be tested to show that one-month delivery. A microsphere product will need a tech-nique to confirm particle size. A lipo-some formulation likely will require a test for free lipid. In many cases, a test for free drug is desired. Depending on the technology used, additional testing for drug uniformity is likely. Finally, sterility testing may need to be adapted for a more complex formulation or ge-ometry\u2014for example, how to test that the inside of an implant is sterile. (Thiel and Loffredo, Hospira): Manufac- turers need to identify the product's critical product attributes and process parameters. For example, for PLGA microspheres, the particle-size distri-bution might be a critical product at-tribute due to its potential impact on the release profile, and the batch size, volume ratio of oil and aqueous phases, temperature of these phases, type of mixer, mixing speed, and duration of mixing may be critical process param-eters that could impact the resulting particle size distribution. The PLGA molecular weight (perhaps measured by intrinsic viscosity) may be another critical product attribute. Regulatory challenges PharmTech: What regulatory challenges do ER injectables manufacturers face compared with more traditional inject-able products? Stickelmeyer (Lilly): As noted, ER in- jectable preparations, such as those based on biodegradable polymers, lipo-somal preparations, micellar prepara-tions, or encapsulation, are considered to be complex dosage forms and as such, additional data (e.g., production scale data) may be required in the mar-keting authorization dossier. Unfortu-nately, specific regulatory guidances have been limited for these parenteral dosage forms. Typically, pharmaceuti-cal scientists have applied the concepts used for modified oral products as a guide. More recently, industrial groups have collaborated with regulatory groups to address the challenges. Tipton (Evonik): There may be a chal- lenge with the development of an in- vivo-in-vitro correlation for some complex products. But in any case, one must have some data on how batch-to-batch performance is achieved for ER. The sterilization technique dis-cussed above is an important regu-latory aspect. Aseptic processes can be intricate, and therefore, a solid development history and validation will be required for product approval. Cleaning methods should be carefully reviewed as well. As the number of in-gredients (polymers in particular) used increases, cleaning process equipment can be more difficult. In addition, filtration may not be a possible process step in many complex formulations, or may only be possible at an early stage in production, so extra care is required for foreign particulates as well as bioburden. Many of these ef-Additional therapeutic a reas for ER injectables \"[Biologics] are natural fits for an injectable route of administration as most are not bioavailable via an oral route. In addition to proteins and other large drug molecules, extended- release (ER) technologies are good fits for drugs t hat are used in clinical areas of low compliance (e.g., bipolar disorder and other behavioral disord ers). The injectable route of administration is also a natural fit where local drug delivery is needed (e.g., an arthritis knee or in the back of the eye for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration),\" \u2014Tipton (Evonik) \"As more therapeutic drugs are being developed that are not suitable for oral administration, there are many new injectable drug products co ming to market. Some of these are to treat chronic conditions, and require repeat dosing due to short half-lives. In some cases, the molecule itself can be changed to prolong the half life and reduce the administration frequency (e.g., PEGylation), but another approach might be to reformulate the existing API into an ER dosage form. As technology advances (especially if larger molecules can be successfully formulated as ER injectables), new therapeutic areas will open up,\" \u2014Thiel and Loffredo (Hospira) \"Increasingly, companies rely on re formulations or seek additional indications for their established drugs to sustain revenues. Furthermore, as healthcare systems across the globe struggle to manage costs and focus on value, the importance of ER injectables is likely to increase due to the value they that can provide to patients and caregivers.... We believe that there is a real opportunity for growth in ER injectables for therapeutic areas in which co mpliance and/or optimization of therapeutic drug administration is important in management of chronic disease,\" \u2014\u00d6rn Almarsson, vice-president, Pharmaceutical R&D (Alkermes) \"Therapeutic areas that would benefit include certain types of cancers, chronic conditions, neuropathic pain, growth diseas es, bone diseases (e.g., deep bone infections in pediatric patients, young adults, and geriatrics), auto-immune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis), and central nervous system diseases.\" \u2014 Mansour (Univ. of Kentucky)Pharmaceutical Technology MAY 2012 47forts in process validation and prod- uct specification will be held in high regard by the regulatory reviewers. (Herbert, Alkermes): In addition to comparability and mechanistic under-standing, site-specific manufacturing is more complex for ER products than for other injectables. A site change may necessitate additional clinical studies for ER injectables, for example. In addition, the process develop- ment section of a company's common technical document submission tends to be longer and more multifaceted when filing for an ER product. In gen-eral, we have found that regulators un-derstand the processes for ER products and are supportive of the technology. Technological challenges PharmTech: What technological gaps exist for manufacturing ER injectables? What's needed going forward? Stickelmeyer (Lilly): There are techno- logical difficulties associated with the manufacture of very small particle-size ranges for nanoparticle formulations. Improvements in achieving narrower particle-size distribution for more consistent release and improved in-jectability are needed. Technology im-provements for sterilization processes of fragile biological products and poly-mer systems are also desired. Tipton (Evonik): In some cases, market needs only require modest production levels, so full economy of scale has not been realized. For products that require small-volume powder filling, there is a limited source of equipment. Isolation and drying of particles can require significant equipment and facility time increasing cost. There re-mains a relatively small number of sup-pliers for some critical raw materials, so backup sourcing can be a challenge in some cases. Of note, using a continuous process- ing method can help to maintain the same equipment for both smaller scale and larger scale production. (Herbert, Alkermes): For polymer- based ER injectables, a polymer that is stable at room temperature and can withstand the temperatures associ-ated with shipping and warehousing would be an important technological advancement. Most microsphere prod-ucts use PLGA-based polymer, which requires cold-chain distribution. Sterilization and validation meth- ods are also an area of near-term need. For example, the industry needs more refined ways of performing gamma- irradiation. Another opportunity is tailoring of molecular structure for intrinsic control of release.

However, there are many other factors that affect the process. PharmTech speaks with powder and particle-analysis experts, Tim Freeman of Freeman Technology and Carl Levoguer of Malvern Instruments, about the challenges of good tableting and implementing QbD. WALTER B. MCKENZIE/PHOTODISC/GETTY IMAGES; COMPOSITING BY DAN WARDPharmTech: In your experience, What attributes besides particle-size distribution must be considered for tableting processes? Freeman (Free- man Tecnology): As the industry focuses on bet-ter manufactur-ing efficiency, there is greater interest in iden-tifying powder properties that directly influence tableting in-process performance and final product qual-ity. Particle-size distribution is a criti-cal primary particle characteristic of powders, but it is only one of many variables that impact bulk powder properties, which in turn dictate in-process behavior and product qual-ity. Bulk property measurements can be an efficient way of accelerating and supporting process optimization studies because they quantify the net effect of all primary particle proper-ties (e.g., size, shape, texture, surface energy and porosity), whether these can be measured directly or not. Fur-thermore, even if all primary particle properties that influence in-process behavior could be measured, the mathematical relationship between bulk powder behavior and particle characteristics remains elusive and highly complex. Hence, the most ef-fective way forward is to measure process relevant characteristics of the bulk powder. Tablet production can be divided into at least four discrete processes: discharge from the hopper; flow into and through the feedframe; die filling; and compression. Each of these pro-cesses subjects the powder to a specific set of environmental conditions (e.g., flow rates, stresses, and equipment sur-face properties), making different bulk properties more relevant at different stages. I would highlight the following as especially valuable:t\u0001 Dynamic flow properties (including Basic Flowability Energy, Specific Energy, Aerated Energy, and Flow Rate Index): to optimise the flow regime in the feedframe and the efficiency of die filling, to investi-gate the effect of paddle geometry, to assess the likelihood of attrition, segregation and agglomeration. t\u0001 Shear properties: for optimising flow from the feed hopper, where shear properties of powder-powder and powder-wall are important. t\u0001 Permeability and compressibility: for assessing how easily the powder can transmit air and the impact of compression on the powder. Both characteristics are important during the filling and compression steps. Levoguer (Malvern Instruments): Success in tableting does indeed de-pend on many factors. It is important, for example, to control the flowability and compressibility of the tableting blend, as well as any tendency towards segregation, to ensure the production of uniform tablets at the required rate. Particle size and particle-size distribution are recognised as critical Optimizing the Tableting Process with a Quality- by-Design Approach Moderated by by Fette Compacting GmbHExperience 2012 Hall 3.0, Stand F3 s TRI sEASY Design for smooth handling t No assembly errors through coded assembly ring t Only one turret for all applications t One central plug for oil, air, power www.fette-compacting.com Fette Compacting America, Inc. 400 Forge a memb er of50 Pharmaceutical Technology MAY 2012 PharmTech.commaterial attributes because they are known to directly impact these prop-erties, as well as others such as solu-bility and bioavailability, which may define clinical efficacy as highlighted in ICH Q6A. As analytical techniques evolve, however, it is becoming easier to identify other parameters that also impact behavior in the tablet press. Here I would highlight particle shape, a parameter that, like particle size, is known to affect powder flowability and segregation. In the past, shape infor-mation was gathered by microscopy, but the advent of automated imaging has made it much faster and easier to access statistically relevant data. Such information forms a foundation for scientific investigation of the impact of shape and supports the development of more successful tableting blends. PharmTech: How are quality-by-de- sign (QbD) approaches changing the way that tableting and granulation processes are viewed? Freeman (Freeman Technology): QbD calls for product quality to be 'designed in' rather than tested for in postproduction. It requires a detailed understanding of all the factors that can impact product quality and clinical ef-ficacy, including those related to the ma-terials employed and the process itself. Traditionally, it has been assumed that raw materials and intermediates can be suitably qualified and the process can be fixed, resulting in a consistent high-quality product. However, this is only achieved by knowing what material properties need to be qualified. While particle-size distribution is important, there are many other particle properties that rarely feature in the specification, but that can be as influential as particle size, such as particle shape and particle- surface roughness. Excluding these prop-erties from the quality specification al-lows variation in raw materials to go undetected, resulting in variable in-pro-cess performance and product quality. Adopting a QbD approach requires an acceptance that raw materials are likely to vary batch to batch, while simultane- ously demonstrating a good grasp of how to configure the process settings within the 'control space' to accommodate the unavoidable variation in material prop-erties, and ultimately achieve consistent product with the desired attributes. Considering a granulation process as an example, this might conventionally be defined in the following terms: pro-cess for X minutes at an impeller speed of Y rpm, whilst adding Z% of water at a consistent addition rate. Process-ing conditions are essentially fixed and applied to each new batch of feed. This means that there is little flexibility to respond to variability arising from any source, such as a new batch of excipient or inadequate control of an upstream operation, for example. Furthermore, problems are usually detected only when granulation is complete. QbD places emphasis on controlling process output, rather than the fixed definition of operating conditions. For granulation, the process defini-tion might change to: manipulate im-peller speed, amount of water, and/or processing time, to produce granules with these specific properties. Adopt-ing this approach, however, relies on being able to identify those specific properties\u2014the criteria for success\u2014and also learning how to control them. In the same way, in tableting, a QbD approach would focus on the defining characteristics of the finished product, such as content uniformity and dis-solution or disintegration properties. Process development then works back from that point, identifying all the fac-tors that influence these properties.Levoguer (Malvern In-struments): Suc- cessful imple-mentation of QbD relies on understanding both the process and product in detail. The focus is on fully evaluating the impact of all variables that influence product qual-ity, and learning how to control them effectively, rather than just identify-ing a manufacturing route that works. QbD extends through to control of the commercial process so it serves to highlight areas where real-time moni-toring can be beneficially applied to meet processing targets. One important feature of particle- size analysis is that, unlike many ana-lytical techniques, it is already a proven technology for real-time plant moni-toring. In granulation processes, for example, both in-line probes based on spatial particle velocimetry and on-line laser diffraction particle size analysers are regularly used for real-time mea-surement. Both enable the continuous tracking of particle size growth during the granulation process towards an es-tablished endpoint. Endpoint detection is a notoriously difficult aspect of granulation so this ability to continuously monitor particle size is extremely useful when manufac-turing to meet a defined output, as ad-vocated by QbD. In addition, however, real-time measurement is extremely valuable during design space scoping studies because it enables rapid and reliable assessment of the impact of a change in operating conditions. Con-tinuous particle-size measurement can therefore accelerate and improve the process development studies associ-ated with QbD. PharmTech: What key challenges continue to exist with regards to un-derstanding particle attributes in a tableting and granulation process? Freeman (Freeman Technology): The bulk properties that define pro-Special Report: tableting \"QbD calls for product quality to be 'designed in' rather than tested for in postproduction.\" \u2014 Tim Freeman, Freeman Tech. 52 Pharmaceutical Technology MAY 2012 PharmTech.comSpecial Report: tableting cessability depend on a wide array of particle attributes, such as particle size and shape, roughness, surface charge, density and porosity. Learn-ing how to control tableting and granulation processes relies, in part, on understanding the relationships between particle attributes and bulk powder properties. This is an area of specific interest to Freeman Technology and we have been involved in a number of experi-mental studies, with industrial part-ners, to investigate, for example, the influence of particle size and shape, and of surface charge, on powder flow-ability, shear properties and bulk pa-rameters, such as (1, 2). Levoguer (Malvern Instruments): Because QbD places emphasis on thoroughly understanding the im-pact of all processing variables, it may call for information that is not easily accessed using conventional testing methods. As a result, the im-plementation of QbD is encouraging the pharmaceutical industry to adopt new analytical technologies as they become available. One such technol-ogy is morphologically directed im-aging, which can combine imaging technology with spectroscopy, such as Raman, to provide chemical identifi-cation alongside size and shape mea-surement. It allows different particles in a dispersed sample, often initially screened on the basis of size or shape, to be reliably identified as specific chemical entities. A conventional way to assay a tab- let is to dissolve it and carry out high- performance liquid chromatography analysis. This gives an averaged mea-sure of the concentration of the active that can be used to assess dose consis-tency, but it provides no information about the size of discrete active par-ticles that are delivered to the body as the tablet disintegrates. In contrast, applying morphologically directed im-aging to a disintegrated tablet sample allows differently sized elements of the resulting powder to be precisely iden-tified as active or excipient. This not only generates useful information for engineering sophisticated drug deliv-ery profiles, but also provides evidence to support claims of bioequivalence for a generic product. PharmTech: What challenges exist with regard to understanding bulk-powder attributes? Freeman (Freeman Technology): I think it is reasonable to say that the pharmaceutical industry's ability to understand how bulk powder prop-erties impact process behavior has been constrained by a lack of reliable bulk powder property data. The re- producible measurement of defining powder characteristics, such as flow-ability, has long been a goal, but the results have been mixed. Traditional techniques, such as flow through an orifice and tapped density methods, are not ideal for the extended, detailed experimental work required to sup-port QbD. Shear-cell measurements are ideal for understanding flow in hoppers, but are less useful for under-standing lower stress processes, such as mixing, filling and aerosolization. Here, different measurement tech-niques are required. Powder testing has developed con- siderably in the past decade, including the introduction of dynamic testing. Dynamic characterization reproducibly and directly measures powder flowabil-ity, for conditioned powders and for those that are consolidated or aerated, thereby generating reliable and valuable information for process development. Used in combination with bulk and shear property measurement, dynamic testing enables the kind of multifaceted powder characterization required to fully rationalise in-process behavior. With these techniques in place, it is now possible to develop a detailed understanding of the way bulk prop-erties influence tableting, granula-tion and many other frequently em-ployed unit operations. This type of knowledge development remains a work in progress, but the goalposts shift too. Faster tableting speeds are one example, but the long-term ob-jectives of continuous production in integrated manufacturing suites adds another layer of complexity, requiring testing strategies that pro-vide the deepest and most compre-hensive information. Levoguer (Malvern Instruments): Generally speaking, my area of ex-pertise is the measurement of particle properties rather than bulk powder at-tributes of the material, such as flow-ability and permeability. However, I've recently observed that some of our more experienced laser diffraction customers within the pharmaceutical sector are now using particle size ana-lyzers to directly access information about the cohesivity of the sample be-cause this is a useful property for tablet blend optimization. Sample dispersion is an essential element of laser diffraction particle-size analysis. In dry measurement, dispersion conditions are established by conducting a pressure titration, which involves gradually increasing the pressure of the dispersing gas until a steady particle size is measured and/or the results obtained are identical to those generated with wet dispersion. Agitation and sonication are applied to achieve wet dispersion. In either case, the development process used to develop a robust method yields pa-rameters that effectively quantify the strength of particle-particle interac-tions within the powder sample. \"...the implementation of QbD is encouraging the pharmaceutical industry to adopt new analytical technologies as they become available.\" \u2014 Carl Levoguer, MalvernPharmaceutical Technology MAY 2012 53In state-of-the-art laser diffrac- tion systems, dispersion conditions can be very precisely controlled and this measure of cohesive strength can therefore be sufficiently sensitive to give useful information for tablet blend optimization. PharmTech: What technological gaps exist among the industry for fully understanding the material properties of powders used in a tableting process? Freeman (Freeman Technology): Particles exhibit a wide range of me- chanical and chemical properties. Several of these are commonly recog-nized as being highly influential with respect to in-process performance and product quality, and are often well defined as part of the specification. However, other properties, which may be even more important in some in-stances, such as particle shape, rough-ness, porosity and stiffness, to name just a few, are rarely considered in a specification because they are either too difficult to measure directly or can't be measured at all. Neverthe-less, that doesn't exclude them from influencing the overall bulk material properties and, consequently, the in-process performance of the powder and the final product quality. Direct measurement of many of these properties will only be achieved with further technological advances, but they will be required if the goal of \"mathematical QbD\" (accurately predicting tablet or gran-ule properties from a knowledge of a range of particle properties) is to be achieved. In the interim, recent advances in bulk powder measure-ment techniques, simulating the conditions powders observe in the process environment and quantify-ing their response to those condi-tions, are likely to provide the best opportunity for understanding the relationship between bulk material properties, process parameters and final product attributes. Levoguer (Malvernns Itruments): As I've previously suggested, one of 54 Pharmaceutical Technology MAY 2012 PharmTech.comthe reasons why our customers mea- sure parameters, such as particle size and shape, is because they are known to correlate with processability issues such as flowability, compressibility and the likelihood of blend segrega- tion. These relationships are widely recognized, but my understanding is that they are not yet quantified in ways that help to establish optimal bulk powder properties. I would, therefore, point to lack of knowledge in the area of correlating particle and bulk pow-der properties as a gap that needs to be filled in the future.As I noted previously, the advance- ment of automated imaging has made it much easier to access the shape data needed to extend our understanding in this important area and we have done some work in this area ourselves with Freeman Technology looking at the effect of particle size and shape on the bulk properties of lactose (1). This is an interesting area of research and one that I'm sure will receive further attention from the pharmaceutical industry as it works to extend under-standing of how to make powders be-have as required.PharmTech: Can you offer any best practices for those beginning to apply a QbD approach to tableting and granulation? Freeman (Freeman Technology): QbD relies heavily on engineering an optimized, well-understood process. It is therefore important, from the outset, to work out how to gather analytical data that will accurately reflect process per-formance. Effective powder handling is central to the success of tableting, gran-ulation and a wide range of other phar-maceutical unit operations. Appropriate powder characterization techniques are, therefore, an essential prerequisite. The number of powder testing tech- niques available reflects both the impor-tance of such testing and its difficulties. When choosing which techniques to apply for QbD studies, I would suggest assessing against a number of criteria including:t\u0001 reproducibility and sensitivityt\u0001 process relevancet\u0001 ease Heads for Science, Hearts for Service.Aptuit People.\"Effective powder handling is central to the success of tableting, granulation, and a wide range of other pharmaceutical unit operations.\" \u2014 Tim FreemanPharmaceutical Technology MAY 2012 55Levoguer (Malvern Instruments): One of the biggest challenges for those applying QbD is how to access and gather the necessary information. The full implementation of QbD demands a comprehensive understanding of pro- cess and product, and the identifica-tion of an effective control strategy for the manufacturing process. Choice of analytical instrumentation is therefore crucial. With well-established techniques such as laser diffraction particle-size measurement, customers can rightly expect the highest levels of automa-tion and analytical productivity. Some systems can extend the efficiencies of dry measurement to more samples and combine rapid measurement times with assured data quality, to push analytical productivity to high levels for all users. Of equal importance, however, are continuous laser diffraction particle size analyzers that offer real-time mea-surement for pilot-scale studies and commercial plant monitoring and con-trol. These systems can significantly accelerate QbD studies. Running a pilot plant with real-time monitoring in place enables consistent control at the experimental conditions of inter-est and makes the impact of changes in operating variables instantly obvious.For some types of analysis, the tech- nology is newer, but it is vital to recog-nize what can now be achieved. Return-ing to the example of morphologically directed imaging, these systems involve considerable investment but can deliver significant value over the long term. Being able to measure not just size and shape but also the distribution of differ-ent chemical species within a dispersed sample, such as a disintegrated tablet, can be invaluable when trying to really understand how the process works and how to optimize it.

Catalysts can enable more effi-cient chemical transformations, improve reaction conditions, better product yields, and produce greater enantioselectivity. Some key recent developments involve palladium-catalyzed hydrogenation, visible-light photocatalysis, chemocata-lytic approaches for making heterocyclic advances in biocatalysis. Palladium-catalyzed hydrogenation Palladium-catalyzed hydrogenation reac-tions are important in industrial chem-istry and fine-chemicals manufacture, but precious metal catalysts, such as pal-ladium, are costly. Researchers at Tufts University's School of Arts and Sciences and School of Engineering in Medford, Massachusetts, recently reported on the arrangement of individual atoms in a metal alloy and their ability to catalyze hydrogenation reactions. Hydrogenation requires the presence of a catalyst, usually a metal or an alloy of both precious and common metals, which allows the hydrogen atoms to bind with other molecules. It is diffi-cult to produce alloys that are selective hydrogenation catalysts and are able to attach the hydrogen atoms to specific sites of another molecule. Tufts chem-ists and chemical engineers reported that when single atoms of palladium were added to copper, which is much cheaper and readily available, the re-sulting \"single atom alloy\" became active and selective for hydrogenation reactions, according to a Mar. 9, 2012, Tufts University press release.

The Tufts scientists scattered single atoms of palladium less than half a nanometer wide onto a copper support. For this research, the Tufts team heated small amounts of palladium to almost 1000 \u00b0C. At that temperature, individ-ual atoms embedded themselves on the copper surface. A scanning tunneling microscope enabled the team to see how these single atoms dispersed in the copper and how molecular hydro-gen could then dissociate at individual, isolated palladium sites and spill over onto the copper surface layer, accord-ing to the Tufts release. Specifically, the researchers used de- sorption measurements in combination with high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy to show that the individual, isolated palladium atoms in a copper surface substantially lowered the energy barrier to both hydrogen uptake on and subsequent desorption from the cop-per metal surface. The hydrogen disso-ciation at the palladium atom sites and weak binding to copper allowed for very selective hydrogenation of styrene and acetylene as compared with pure copper or palladium metal alone (1). Visible-light photocatalysis A team of University of Arkansas (US) researchers reported on using visible-light photocatalysis with a ruthenium catalyst to produce a building block in pharmaceutical synthesis. Specifically, the researchers reported on a visible-light-mediated intermolecular in good yields. Saturated 5,5- and 6,5-fused het-erocycles were obtained in synthetically useful yields and diastereoselectivity (2). Enantioselective N-heterocycles Heterocyclic compounds are important in pharmaceutical applications, and re-searchers at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) recently reported on an advance in the synthesis of such compounds. They reported on their work in the enantioselective construction of 2012 PharmTech.comPharma Ingredients: APIs & Excipients \"We think it's going to be a highly en- abling reaction, not only for preparing complex natural products, but also for making pharmaceutical substances that include components that were previously very challenging to make,\" said Brian Stoltz, professor of chemistry at Caltech, in a Jan. 13, 2012, university press release. \"This has suddenly made them quite easy to make, and it should allow medicinal chemists to access levels of complexity they couldn't previously access. Specifically, the researchers re- ported on the highly enantioselective related lactams. The research-ers assert that the synthesis provides a new approach for the asymmetric syn-thesis of such structures, an important development given the prevalence of quaternary N-heterocycles in biologi- cally active alkaloids and pharmaceu-tical agents. researchers reported that the catalysis provided enantiopure quaternary lactams that intercept syn-thetic intermediates previously of the Aspidosperma alka- loids, quebrachamine and rhazinilam, but that were previously produced by chiral auxiliary approaches or as race-mic mixtures (3). Advances in biocatalysis Codexis, a biocatalysis company, re-ported last month on its work with Merck & Co. for developing an enzyme-based production method for a key intermediate in the production of boceprevir, the API in Merck's Victrelis, a drug to treat hepatitis C. The compa-nies reported on a chemoenzymatic pro-cess for manufacturing proline intermediate based amine oxidase-catalyzed desymme-trization. feature in boceprevir is the bicyclic proline moiety, which during development stages, was produced by a classical resolution. As the drug candidate advanced, Codexis and Researchers recently reported positive clinical results for a targeted therapeutic nanoparticle as an anticancer therapy. The targeted nanotechnology-based drug-delivery method is considered an important breakthrough in targeting and better controlling dosing of a chemotherapeutic agent. The targeted polymeric nanoparticle (TNP) contained the chemotherapeutic docetaxel and was developed from a combinatorial library of more than 100 TNP formulations varying with respect to particle size, targeting ligand density, surf ace hydrophilicity, drug loading, and drug-release properties (1). The targeted nanoparticle, BIND-014, is a nanomedicine that combines a targeting ligand and a therapeutic nanoparticle containing docetaxel encapsulated in biocompatible and biodegradable polymers. BIND-014 targeted to the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a cell-surface antigen abundantly expressed on the surface of cancer cells and on new blood vessels that feed a wide array of solid tumors. In preclinical cancer models, BIND-014 was shown to deliver tenfold more docetaxel to tumors than an equivalent dose of conventional docetaxel. The increased accumulation of docetaxel at the site of disease translated to marked improvements in antitumor activity and tolerability, acco rding to an Apr. 4, 2012, press release by the Prostate Cancer Foundation. BIND-014 entered clinical trials in January 2011. The Phase I clinical trial was performed by researchers at the biopharmaceutical company BIND Biosciences, a company cofounded by Robert Langer, the David H. Koch Institute Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Omid Farokhzad, director of the Laboratory of Nanomedicine and Biomaterials at Brigham and Women's Hospital and associate professor of anesthesia at Harvard Medical School. \"The initial clinical results of tumor regression even at low doses of the drug validates our preclinical findings that actively targeted nanoparticles preferentially accumulate in tumors,\" said Langer, in an Apr. 4, 2012, MIT press release. \"Previous attempts to develop targeted nanoparticles have not successfully translated into human clinical studies because of the inherent difficulty of designing and scaling up a particle capable of targeting tumors, evading the immune system, and releasing drugs in a controlled way.\"The BIND-014 nanoparticles have three components: one that carries the drug, one that targets PSMA, and one that helps evade macrophages and other immune-system cells. \"This study demonstrates for the first time that it is possible to generate medicines with both targeted and programmable properties that can co ncentrate the therapeutic effect directly at the site of disease, po tentially revolution izing how complex diseases such as cancer are treated,\" said Farokhzad in the MIT release. One of the challenges in developing effective drug-delivery nanoparticles is designing them so they can evade the body's normal immune response and reach their intended targets. \"You need exactly the right combination of these properties because if they don't have the right concentration of targeting molecules, they won't get to the cells you want, and if they don't have the right stealth properties, they'll get taken up by macrophages,\" said Langer in the MIT press release. The Phase I clinical trial involved 17 patients with advanced or metastatic tumors who had already gone through tra ditional chemotherapy. To determine safe dosages, patients were given escalating doses of the nanoparticles. In the 48 hours after treatment, the researchers found that docetaxel concentration in the patients' blood was 100 times higher with the nanoparticles as compared to docetaxel administered in its conventional form. Higher blood concentration of BIND-014 facilitate d tumor targeting re sulting in tumor shrinkage in patients, in some cases with doses of BIND-014 that correspond to as low as 20% of the amount of docetaxel normally given. The nanoparticles were also effective in cancers in which docetaxel usually has little activity, including cervical cancer and cancer of the bile ducts. The researchers also found that in animals treated with the nanoparticles, the concentration of docetaxel in the tumors was up to tenfold higher than in animals treated with conventional docetaxel injection for the first 24 hours, and that nanoparticle treatment resulted in enhanced tumor re duction, according to the MIT release. The Phase I clinical trial is still on going and continued dose escalation is underway. BIND Biosciences is now planning Phase II trials, which will further investigate the treatment's effectivenes s in a larger number of patients. Source 1. R. Langer et al., Sci. Transl.

The key part of the reaction sequence is an enzymatic oxidative desymmetrization of a prochiral amine substrate (4). According to Codexis, the new method increased chemical intermediate yield 150% over the previous process. It also reduced raw material use by 60%, water use by 61%, and overall process waste by 63%. Codexis used its proprietary CodeEvolver directed evolution technol-ogy to develop the custom enzyme for use in the commercial-scale manufacturing of the boceprevir intermediate. Codexis had earlier partnered with Merck & Co. for another biocatalytic route. In 2010, Merck and Codexis re-ported on the biocatalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines from ketones in the of sitagliptin, the API in Merck's antidiabetes drug hydro-genation for the large-scale manufacture researchers started from an ( R)-selective transaminase that showed slight activity on a smaller trun-cated methyl ketone analogue of the sita-gliptin ketone. After creating this trans-aminase, which had marginal activity for the synthesis of the chiral amine, they further engineered the enzyme through directed evolution to optimize its use for large-scale manufacturing (5-8). The initial ( R)-selective trans- aminase was a homologue of an en-zyme from Arthrobacter sp., which previously was used for ( R)-specific transamination of methyl ketones and small cyclic ketones. the sita-gliptin synthesis, the researchers gen-erated a structural homology model of this transaminase and found that the enzyme would not bind to the prosi-tagliptin ketone because of steric in-terference and potentially undesired interactions. evolved transaminase thesized the chiral accessible only through resolution (5-8). Codexis and Merck were recognized in 2010 with an Environmental Pro-tection Agency's Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award, an an-nual recognition of advances in green chemistry. Codexis also submitted for consideration in 2010 and 2011 a bio-catalytic route for making simvastatin, the active ingredient in Merck & Co.'s anticholesterol drug Zocor, which is now off patent (5, 8, 9). For the simvastatin route, Codexis licensed technology from Yi Tang, pro-fessor in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of California at Los Ange-les. The previous synthetic routes to simvastatin involved converting lov-astatin into simvastatin by adding a methyl group that required protecting and then deprotecting other function-alities in the lovastatin molecule in a multistep synthesis. In the first route, lovastatin was hydrolyzed to the triol, monacolin J, followed silylation, esterification dimethyl butyryl chloride, and deprotection. The second in-volved protecting the carboxylic acid and alcohol functionalities, methylat-ing the C2\u00b4 carbon with methyl iodide, and deprotecting the product. These routes were inefficient because they produced less than 70% overall yield and were mass-intensive due to protec-tion and deprotection (5, 8). The route developed by Tang and his group circumvented protection and de-protection and resulted in greater atom economy, reduced waste, and overall less hazardous reaction conditions. First, they cloned LovD, a natural acyltransferase produced by Aspergillus terreus that is involved in synthesizing lovastatin and that can accept nonnatural acyl donors. Recognizing that LovD might be a type of simvastatin synthase and a starting point for creating a new biocatalytic process, they evolved the enzyme toward com-mercial utility (5, 8-10). Codexis licensed Tang's technology, engineered the en-zyme further, and optimized the process for pilot-scale simvastatin manufacture. Codexis is an example of a firm spe- cializing in biocatalysis. Another is evo-catal GmbH, which was founded in 2006 as a spin-off of the Institute for Molecular Enzyme Technology at the University of D\u00fcsseldorf in the Research Center J\u00fclich. Last November, evocatal issued a carbon-carbon coupling kit py-rophosphate-dependent (TPP) enzymes to produce enantiopure 2-hydroxy- ketones, an important intermediate class for pharmaceutical syntheses. The kit in-cludes seven different TPP-enzymes with the relevant cofactor. References 1. C.H. Sykes, Science 335 (6073), 1209- 1212 (2012). 2. S. Maity et al., Angew. Chem. Int.

In addition, equipment i s cleaned to remove residues from th e previous batch of product, and subse - quently flushed to remove the cleanin g liquids. To ensure that sterilizatio n and cleaning are efficient and safe, it i s not enough to develop the appropriat e procedures. Selecting the right manu - facturing equipment further improve s cost efficiency, as well as patient safety . Considerations in equipmen t selecti on The chosen equipment must mini - mize the risk of contamination du e to inappropriate product-contact sur - faces. Machines should not introduc e airborne particles and dust into th e environment, nor should they entai l the risk that oil or other substance s required for their operation will con - taminate the product. If an operato r cannot contact all equipment surface s adequately, he or she simply canno t clean them. To facilitate efficient clean - ing, equipment must be designed wit h this principle in mind . The time, action, chemicals, an d temperature (TACT) circle originall y developed by Sinner in 1960 shows th e cleaning effects that these parameter s generate on the equipment surface (se e Figure 1). The circle shows the exten t to which time, plus at least one mor e parameter, clean residues from a sur - face. If one parameter is increased, th e others may be reduced . For example, if one dips one's greas y hands in water, they will not becom e clean. If one puts them into a soa p bath, they will become clean, but onl y after a long time. If one raises the tem - perature of the soap bath, however , one's hands will become clean mor e quickly. But if one also rubs one' s hands together, they will become clea n even more quickly . The residue and the product-contac t surface determine the size, or the im - pact, needed for the cleaning process . The most suitable type of chemical s and the appropriate temperature ar e decided according to the residue. Hig h surface action enables the chemical s and temperature to work more effi - ciently, which makes it possible to re - duce both of these parameters, as wel l as the cleaning time. Because the ac - tion is often built into the equipmen t design, selecting the right equipmen t can reduce the cost and increase th e cleanability of a system . Cleaning action on the equipme nt surface is achieved by generating hig h velocity or flow of cleaning fluids o n all product-contact surfaces. This tech - nique distributes the chemicals an d temperature better than low velocit y does. Increased velocity also gener - ates high turbulence and shear forc e on the surface, which ensures that th e chemicals and temperatures reach dee p into the residues and dissolve or detac h them safely and efficiently . Testing TACT parameter s To test the influence of the TAC T parameters, the author designed a tank-cleaning test incorporating tw o tank-cleaning devices that generate d different amounts of action. A stati c spray ball typically generates a wal l shear stress of 2-5 Pa (i.e., falling fil m stress, depending on liquid tempera - ture). A rotating jet head typically gen - erates a wall shear stress of 40-1000 P a (i.e., jet impingement, depending on je t pattern mesh) . To clean the tank sufficiently, tw o static spray balls operated for 48 mi n at a flow rate of 20 m3/h and a syste m pressure of 2.5 bar. One rotating je t head, however, achieved better result s when it operated for 14 min at a fl ow rate of 6 m3/h and a system pressur e of 5.0 bar (see Figures 2 and 3 an d Table I) . The test showed that the theory o f the TACT circle works in practice. T o clean a certain residue from a certai n surface, the parameters in the TAC T circle can be adjusted for cost optimi - zation (see Figure 3). With increase d action, it was possible to reduce th e Equipmen t design and cleaning procedures both play a role in thorough sterilization and cleaning.Per-\u00c5ke OhlssonFacilitating Efficient Equipment Cleaning Figure 1: The time, action, chemistry, and temperature circle.

High shear forces can remove residues from most sur-faces by themselves without chemicals or high temperatures. This technique can reduce the risk of contamination from cleaning chemicals and dramati-cally reduce cleaning costs. Equipment design pitfalls Strong cleaning action on all product-contact surfaces minimizes the risks of contamination and of system mal-function and also enables cost-efficient cleaning. Common design pitfalls, however, impair equipment cleanabil-ity. Dead legs, pockets and crevices, air pockets, and improper equipment surfaces are pitfalls too often seen in the pharmaceutical industry. Dead legs. It is widely understood that dead legs should be avoided or minimized in a system (see Figure 4). Some guidance states that the length to Figure 4: Dead leg.

The re-lation between the main-pipe velocity and the L/D measurement, however, is often overlooked. High main-pipe ve-locity makes the turbulence go deeper into the dead leg, and if the turbulence or action is strong enough, it will re-move the residues at the bottom of the dead leg. In a 1997 article, Haga et al. pre- sented results from tests with various velocities in the main pipe in various L/D measurements (1). They found that for an L/D of 6, it is possible to clean the residue adequately if the main-pipe velocity is higher than 1.5 m/s. They also found that for an L/D of 3, it is impossible to remove the residue if the main-pipe velocity is lower than 0.7 m/s (see Figure 5). Pockets and crevices. N o r ul e o f thumb governs the depth of pockets and crevices. Figure 6 shows a typi-cal crevice found in pharmaceutical systems. Many guidances state that crevices should be avoided or elimi-nated when possible, a statement that seems weak considering that a crevice could be likened to a dead leg with an L/D measurement of 50-100, com-pared with the normal 2-3. Following Haga et al., it would be impossible to achieve the velocity required to clean the bottom of a crevice. Thus, pock-ets and crevices should not exist in pharmaceutical systems because they will always pose a major contamina-tion risk. Air pockets. Air pockets may be de- scribed as upside-down dead legs or crevices (see Figure 7). Although resi-dues do not collect in an air pocket, they stick to its surface. It is difficult to evacuate the air from these pockets during the cleaning process, which means that the cleaning liquid will not reach the top of the air pocket and, accordingly, will not clean it. Air pockets, therefore, must be eliminated, or they will introduce a high risk of contamination. Surface finish. Surface finish is often considered a measurement of hygienic design. The maxim is that the smoother the surface, the more hygienic and easy to clean. But this principle is, in fact, open to debate. A 2003 study by Hilbert et al. tested the adherence of bacteria to several surfaces and the cleanability of these surfaces (2). The surfaces, from 0.1 m electro-polished to 0.8 m me-chanically polished, showed no dif-ferences in adherence or cleanability. The main reason was the relatively large size of the individual bacteria compared with the small size of the surface imperfections. As long as the surface finish is below Ra 0.8-1.0 m, the bacteria are too large to get trapped between the surface imper-fections. In another study, however, Riede- wald showed that when bacteria ac-cumulate in a biofilm, adherence and cleanability depend on the surface fin-ish (3). It is hard for biofilm to attach to a smooth surface, and thus it is easy to detach them from such a surface. The same is true for other sticky residues. A study at the Institute of Technology in Kolding, Denmark, tested the cleanability of surfaces spiked with a yogurt solution that had been oven-dried (4). This study clearly showed that a surface with a low Ra value was easier to clean than one with a high Ra value. The tested surfaces ranged from Ra 0.15 to 2.4 m. Elec-tropolished surfaces also were easier to clean than mechanically polished surfaces, which, in turn, are easier to clean than pickled surfaces. Equipment designed correctly will avoid the above pitfalls, thus facilitat-ing safe and cost-efficient cleaning. The more cleaning action is applied on all product-contact surfaces, the easier, safer, and quicker system clean-ing will be. References 1. R. Haga et al., Pharm. Eng. 17 (5), 8-21 (1997). 2. L.R.

While HPMC is generally well studied, the disintegration rate of HPMC without gelling agents or other additives had not yet been researched. In this article, the authors investigate the disintegration rate of HPMC and gelatin films as a function of film thickness and media temperature and propose a mechanism for HPMC disintegration.

Manufacture of capsules or coated tablets for disintegration testing can be a time-consuming process and requires large amounts of material. For this reason, properties of solution-cast films are typically used to predict disintegration performance in capsule or coating applications. The disintegration proper-ties of these free-standing films are particularly important in simulating how a tablet or capsule will dissolve in the human stomach, intestine, or mouth because disintegration rates directly affect the release profile and bioavailability of APIs encapsulated by the tablet or capsule. The disintegration rate of HPMC films has been well documented (1-5). Disintegration of HPMC capsule shells has been investigated by Chiwele, Podczeck, Sakaeda, El-Malah, and Cole (6-10). Cole showed that capsules made using gellan gum as a gelling agent showed little drug release in acidic conditions (pH = 1.2), while several other research-ers showed that capsules made with carrageenan as a gell-ing agent had dissolution properties comparable to gelatin capsules (6-9). The disintegration of HPMC without gelling agents or other additives under varying conditions, however, has not been carefully investigated. In addition, the underly-ing mechanism of HPMC film disintegration has not been thoroughly studied. It also is important to understand the influence of film thickness and temperature of testing media on the disintegration rate so pharmaceutical manufactur-ers can use HPMC as an alternative material to gelatin (11). Materials and methods The films evaluated in this study were made from low vis-cosity (i.e., low molecular weight) HPMC (HPMC 2910, The Dow Chemical Company). Table I lists key properties of the HPMC polymer. Disintegration testing also included empty gelatin capsules and HPMC capsules (Capsugel). HPMC solution preparation. HPMC solutions were prepared by quickly dispersing HPMC polymer into hot deionized water (> 80 \u00b0C) contained in an 800-mL beaker equipped with a Characterizing the Disintegration Rate of Hypromellose Films and Capsules Jin Zhao, Carol Mohler, Jaime Curtis-Fisk, and Karen Coppens 66 Pharmaceutical Technology MAY 2012 PharmTech.comthree-blade agitator. The rota- tion rate during the addition of polymer was set to maintain a vortex that continuously drew the polymer powder into the water (> 400 rpm). After poly-mer addition, the solutions were covered and allowed to stir at 400 rpm for an additional 1-3 h at room temperature. The solu-tions were stored in a refrigerator overnight to allow air bubbles to dissipate and, if necessary, cen-trifuged at room temperature for less than an hour to eliminate any remaining bubbles. In some cases, multiple so- lutions were prepared using robotic instrumentation (see Figure 1). In these instances, the HPMC polymer was dispensed into 20-mL vials using Hot deionized water (80 \u00b0C) was delivered to each vial using a liquids-handling robot (Extended Core Module, Symyx Technologies) while stir-ring at 150 rpm with magnetic stir bars. Continuous stirring at 80 \u00b0C and the use of higher stir speeds (300 rpm) for extended times (1 h) dispersed the pow-der and minimized particle aggregation. Stirring speed was increased to 500 rpm while the solution was cooled to 5 \u00b0C. The solutions were stored at 5 \u00b0C overnight to complete hy-dration of the polymer. Film casting. Films (approximately 20 x 36 cm) were cast on glass substrates at room temperature using an 8-in. (ap-proximately 20 cm) adjustable doctor blade (Gardco). Mi-crometers were set to various thicknesses. The doctor blade was drawn at a constant speed using an automatic film ap-plicator (Elcometer 4340, Elcometer) with a slow speed set-ting of 1. Before measuring film properties, the films were allowed to air dry in a constant temperature room (22 \u00b0C and 50% relative humidity) for two days, were removed from the substrate, and were allowed to equilibrate in the constant temperature room for at least another day. Some films were prepared on glass substrates using an au- tomated, high-throughput coating station (Symyx Technolo-gies) with a 1-in.-wide (approximately 2.5 cm), automated drawdown bar set to various thicknesses. The film draw-down speed was 20 mm/s. Films were prepared and dried in a laboratory with controlled temperature and humidity (22 \u00b0C, 50% relative humidity) for two days before being removed from the glass. Films were annealed for at least an additional day before film properties were measured. Film Disintegration. Disintegration of both prepared films and capsules was measured using a ball sample holder in conjunction with a dissolution test system (QC-21, Hanson Research) (12). The samples were subjected to controlled stress by means of a stainless steel ball to simulate shearing and agitation that a capsule or tablet would go through in the stomach. Capsule samples were prepared by removing small sections of each capsule and performing disintegration test-ing on these flattened sections. Two different aqueous buffer media, potassium chloride in hydrochloric acid (KCl/HCl, pH = 1.2) and dihydrogen phosphate in sodium hydroxide (KH 2PO4/NaOH, pH =5.8) were used as defined by United States Pharmacopeia (13). The KCl/HCl buffer medium was prepared by blending 50 mL of 0.2 M aqueous KCl and 85 mL of 0.2 M aqueous HCl. The KH 2PO4/NaOH buffer medium was prepared by blending 50 mL of 0.2 M aqueous KH2PO4 and 3.6 mL of 0.2 M aqueous NaOH. Disintegration time was recorded as the total time from immersion of the sample in Figure 1: Robotics were used to prepare hypromellose films.

Why? Well-managed boutiques offer expert, specialist services and con- sultation, typically in niche areas, to guide pharmaceutical and biotech companies through product development and the lab- yrinth of government processes to a new drug approval. Of course, the generalist Contract Manufacturing Organizations (CMO) will continue to thrive, even as big pharma and biotechs become more judicious in their outsourcing. But with more contracts being awarded based on the expertise of key people involved, special- ist CMOs are emerging as a vendor-of- choice for sophisticated customers who do not want to pay for their contractor's Career Highlights For almost 30 years, Dr. Gordon Dow has been spearheading Dow Pharmaceutical Science's evolution in- to an internationally recognized, topi- cal product development company. Prior to founding Dow Dermatolog- ics in 1977, Gordon served as Vice President of Research and Develop- ment at Ingram Pharmaceuticals; a company later acquired by Syntex, where he developed seven commer- cially successful products, including four dermatologicals. Dr. Dow holds a doctorate in phar- macy from the University of Califor- nia in San Francisco. Gordon's keen sense of balance between science and business has been a key compo- nent in Dow's service business. This unique 'balance' provides Dow's cus- tomers a durable advantage in topical product development and their best chance at success. Dow Pharmaceutical Sciences spe- cializes in the development of topical drug products for pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients in the United States and Euope. The company pro- vides a full range of product develop- ment services including formulation and regulatory consulting, formulation optimization utilizing state-of-the-art in vitro permeation models, full analytical support, cGMP clinical manufacturing and clinical labeling.

Take topical product development, the area of expertise offered by my company, Dow Pharmaceutical Sciences. It's a niche market, represent- ing only about 5 percent of FDA approv- als, but it requires a level of expertise not typically found in-house or at a gen- eralist CMO. As a result, we have devel- oped more prescription topical derma- tological formulations than any company in the world. This exclusivity has not always been available to big pharma and biotech. Back in the late '70s and early '80s, when I first began working in contract manufacturing, outsourcing was fairly new and not commonly used. CMOs seeking new business responded to cus- tomer requests and grew as generalists with expanding offerings. Fast forward a decade and CMOs in the '90s had rap- idly become the norm, with extensive use of outsourcing to speed the path to drug development, clinical testing and government approval. In the last decade, however, I've witnessed a more judicious, balanced approach to contract research and manufacturing, at least among the bigger pharmaceutical companies. Buy- ers are more sophisticated and their in- ternal structures have become more ef- ficient in evaluating, selecting, monitoring and managing outsourcing partners. The level of expectations has risen \u2014 and with it, the respect for the boutique firm and the expertise it provides.Specialization advantages CMOs that specialize still offer depth and breadth \u2014 just a focused form. Spe- cialists offer depth of knowledge in their field, while breadth refers to the array of services available. Dow handles every- thing from formulation development, in vitro testing, method development and stability to GMP clinical manufacturing, clinical labeling and distribution. We also handle regulatory planning and FDA sub- missions. But we do so only for topical products, mainly in dermatology, oph-thalmology and other specialized appli- cations. The advantage for our clients is evident: of the 30 prescription topical der- matological product NDAs approved by the FDA between 2005 and 2010, 11 of the formulations were developed by Dow. What to look for in a CMO\u2014 boutique or otherwise Engaging a contract manufacturer in- volves three primary factors: confidence, fit and communication. Clients need a strong sense of confidence in the man- agement team and in the expertise of the key personnel on their project. You develop confidence through word-of- mouth recommendations, the CMOs' track record, audits and reputation, and also through reference checks. Con- tracts just aren't consummated without confidence on the part of the buyer. Fit is also critically important. There needs to be a proper match between \"Whether you're looking for a plumber, surgeon or CMO, typically the fi rst thing you want to know is how much experience the person pos- sesses and whether they do a great job.\" SPECIAL ADVERTISING SECTION 3rd Home: 80 Glen Drive, Mill Valley, CA 4th Home: 80 Lomita Mill Valley, CA 1981-1985 1985-1990what the client needs done and the exper- tise and experience of the CMO providing the service. Looking beyond their glossy brochures, does the CMO have lots of ex-perience doing what it is you need done? Similarly, CMOs must ask themselves tough questions about their ability to take on projects, not only from the perspec- tive of available skills, resources and ex- perience, but also adhering to the client's timing and budget. As tough as it is, we'd rather pass on a project that stretches our abilities than undertake the high risk of an unhappy customer. Often overlooked in selecting a CMO is the style and method of communica- tion. This is extremely important to the success of your project and relationship. The modes of communication, including reporting, input, feedback and so forth are very important to understand. Good communication does not just happen. And projects do not succeed by draft- ing a protocol, working remotely on it for six months, and then filing a report. You want constant conversation and an on- going dialogue. You want your CMO to become an extension of your company. Critical differentiators At Dow, I place a lot of emphasis on our experience. It's something I highly value and believe our customers do too. Whether you're looking for a plumber, surgeon or CMO, typically the first thing you want to know is how much experi-ence the person possesses and whether they do a great job. You want to give the job to the person who's been through it \u2014 many times, who knows the pitfalls and can get you efficiently to a success- ful result. That takes experience and expertise. Specialized CMOs offer this distinction because they focus uniquely on one or a few areas. In addition, I find they bring a certain enthusiasm, commit- ment and spark to client projects. Another differentiator is the CMOs relationship with the FDA or govern- ment agencies outside the U.S. While regulatory compliance is a given, for CMOs that make it a top priority in their business, it pays off. CMOs benefit their clients best when they are fully knowl- edgeable of regulations, understand where there is room for flexibility \u2014 or more than one way to get the job done, and grow and improve by listening to feedback and input. The CMOs relationship with the FDA is critical in the submissions process for approvals of new drug applications. The FDA is a huge organization with a difficult job. Look for a CMO that has a highly professional relationship with the FDA, one based on mutual respect. This can save you time and money, because your CMO will know what questions to ask and how, and when to push back if they think there is a better, alternate way of achieving the goal. The formulation development process Success for us at Dow comes from a deep appreciation of the formulation development process. It starts with a clear definition of the product profile. From that we can design formulations on theoretical and literature basis as well as actual preformulation data that we would generate early in the formulation development process. It's a blend of un- derstanding the science, the compound, the disease, and formulating various prototypes, testing them, refining them based on those results, and ultimately having choices using a matrix analysis to select a formula that meets all the criteria that we need in our product profile. You need to think about the disease state we're treating, the skin vehicle interaction, the body sites, the surface area that needs to be treated. Is it a small area like a wart? Or, is it a large area that might be involved in atopic dermatitis? Next, we need to consider the dos- age form. There are many different dosage forms listed if you check the PDR. The primary conventional ones are creams, lotions, and ointments. But in more recent years, there's been a proliferation of more novel dosage forms, such as foams. But even so, the majority of topical products are delivered as creams. Around 75 percent of prod- ucts are creams in the United States. SPECIAL ADVERTISING SECTION 5th Home: 70 LomitaMill Valley, CA 6th Home: 951 Petaluma Blvd. Petaluma CA 1990-1993 1993-1998That's a little bit different in other countries. In Europe ointments are more popular. Why is the dosage form important? It can influence revenue from a product. It can differentiate a brand from a generic. Third-party payers sometimes will only cover one dosage form for a particular drug substance. FDA has made strides to clarify this confusion. Buhse and Kibbe have created a systematic way of classifying topical dosage forms, and the primary dosage forms in their clas- sification: Solution, suspension, lotion, paste, ointment, cream, and gel. Determining the basic principles Preformulation . This is the first labo- ratory work that we do in a formulation process. Physical chemical properties are examined. They're typically available when the formulator starts on the project. A solubility profile is something that we do. The stability profile is also something that we need to look at as well as incompati- bilities. How is the drug going to degrade? If it's going to degrade, is it oxidized or hydrolyzed? What is the impact of pH and light or other factors? Solubility . We have to look at the characteristics of the active pharma-ceutical ingredient in various acceptable pharmaceutical excipient solvents. Water is important to know. Polar organic sol- vents such as PEG 400, propylene glycol, glycerin, are important to know. And then the lipophilic materials such as isopropyl myristate, or mineral oil. Compatibility . After we find that there's good solubility in certain solvents, we cook it for a while and see if it changes color or if we get a lot of degradation by HPLC; and that's very useful information at the very beginning. Choosing the best ingredients How do we select excipients? The main principle is we need to justify each one. Why is it in there, and does it have a function? The rule of thumb for topical drugs is, the fewer excipients, the better. Now, with cosmetics, it's kind of the op- posite of that. The longer the list, the better it is, at least that's what our thinking is\u2014or at least the marketing folks have led us to believe that. But, that's not so when you're dealing with the FDA and getting drugs approved, and you're looking at stability. In that case, I just want as simple a system as possible that does the job. You want to use old well-character- ized active ingredients. If a novel excipi- ent is essential for stability, or perfor- mance, or some other function, there's no reason you shouldn't do it. But try to select one that has a history of use in humans as a cosmetic or as a food ingredient that has a well-known safety profile. Skin tolerability is important and that's not often available if it's not used in cosmetics. And you have to think about purity and relevant specifications because that's going to be important for these novel excipients. You also want to think about having an active excipient because active excipients in the disease state can be problematic when you get to the clinical program be- cause you have to beat the vehicle. And vehicle effects are real, and you don't want to help the vehicle any more than you need to when you get to your clinical program. Understanding skin transport issues in formulation One of the functions of the skin is as a barrier. It's design and its function is to keep noxious toxic materials out of our bodies and to protect us, and I think the skin thinks that drugs fall into that cate- gory. So getting our topical agents across the stratum corneum is typically one of the biggest problems we face as formulators. Transport is typically across the lipid junctions, the mortar part of the bricks and mortar function. Some transport goes transcellular and appendageal transport can also be very significant, and by that I mean through the pilosebaceous apparatus or the hair follicles. Solute transport through normal skin in the absence of a solvent or enhancer is predominantly through the intercellu-lar region. Solvents and enhancers can increase transport through the intercellu- lar route but may also facilitate transport through the transcellular and the transfol- licular routes. We can influence all three SPECIAL ADVERTISING SECTION 7th Home: 1330 Redwood Way Petaluma, CA 1998-Presentroutes of delivery through formulation. Drug in solution is the primary mode for skin permeation. Saturated or near saturated solutions are generally superior to highly solubilized systems. Supersatu- rated solutions provide increased thermo- dynamic activity and a driving force that can markedly enhance skin permeation. If you have a suspended drug, it must first dissolve in situ on the skin before it can penetrate. In that situation, particle size of that suspended drug is important. Many people think that you get good delivery if you simply put a skin penetra- tion enhancer in a formulation. Well it's not quite that simple. It turns out that skin penetration enhancers are compound specific and highly formulation depen- dent. They need to be optimized in a given formulation, and putting more in causes problems oftentimes because they can be irritating. So more isn't necessarily better. Occlusive vehicles such as ointments have sometimes been effective in enhanc- ing penetration, corticosteroid ointments are a good example of this. There are a lot of factors that have to be kept in mind, and one of them is the skin disease that you're treating and the skin barrier that's involved with that par- ticular disease. In some cases, you have an increased barrier; warts are a very thickened hyperkeratotic condition, and the distance the drug has to travel to get to the site of action is pretty extensive, and it's a very difficult condition to treat with topical drugs. As a matter of fact, there's no approved prescription drug for warts. There are some OTC products, in the monograph. Designing a formula from the ground up The first thing we think about is drug or active drug substance in the product, that's in the bottle, versus drug once it's on the skin. To get through some defi- nitions here we would call the primary formulation the drug product that's de- livered or poured out of the bottle from the container closure system. So that's what we see in the bottle. That's what we have to have specs on for the FDA and for regulatory purposes, and that's what has to be stable.But on application to the skin, many of these excipients evaporate. Others pene- trate to different extents into the skin; and the drug and residual excipients blend with the endogenous materials of the skin, mostly sebum, some moisture. And that's what we call the secondary formulation, that residual that's on the skin. Some- times it's hardly perceptible, but it's there; and that's the vehicle or the formulation, the secondary formulation, from which the drug is delivered into the skin. So what do we think about when we consider the primary formulations, as formulators? We think about the physi- cal state of the drug, is it dissolved or is it suspended? If it's suspended, what's the particle size? Chemical stability and homogeneity, those are important regu- latory considerations. Physical stability . We always have to think about manufacturing and pro- cess and scale-up as we're developing formulations. We don't want to create a formulation that requires a special piece of equipment that factories don't have. We want to make sure that the process is robust enough to ensure successful 'scale-up' from 50 gram batches to 1000 kilo batches. Package compatibility . Package compatibility include pharmaceutical properties such as pH, viscosity, ad- equate preservation against microbial growth and ease of application on the skin. What's the sensory perception dur- SPECIAL ADVERTISING SECTION BROUGHT TO YOU BYing and after application? And then, how does it change from the primary formu- lation as it transitions to the secondary formulation. So there's a lot of things to think about at the same time. We also think about how the sec- ondary formulation's going to perform because that's where the rubber meets the road for drug delivery. So if you think about stability, it's the primary formula- tion. If you think of delivery, it's really the secondary formulation. More things to think about Think about the physical state of the drug. You want to optimize delivery in that situation. Generally you don't want it to crystallize quickly after you put it on the skin. You want to think about the interac- tions of the drug substance, the residual solvents and the skin components. You want to make sure it's locally tolerable; it's compatible with diseased skin, that it's going to be cosmetically acceptable. It's going to be what we call wearable that people aren't going to feel like they're in plastic wrap after it is applied to the skin. That we want it to stay on the skin and not wipe or rub off too easily. So the way we approach formulation development of topicals at Dow is we do look at what are the greatest challenges for a particular active drug substance and disease state that we're approach- ing? So delivery is often an important one, and it's the key to clinical success from a formulator's standpoint. It's the biggest thing a formulator can do to en- sure clinical success. Stability on the other hand, is the key to regulatory success because if you don't have stability you're not going to get to first base, either with FDA or commer- cially. If the FDA wasn't there to put up a stop sign, you'd fail in the marketplace.Final considerations After we've done our work, four to six months have passed\u2014we're ready to select the formula. So we've devel- oped the criteria for a weighted evalua- tion as we make the decision. There are going to be trade-offs. As we make our trade-offs, we can't compromise stabil- ity; it's essential. If we've done a good job during the formulation development process, we have data that will provide us more than one choice. We won't just be stuck with one formulation. And ideally, we want to have the for- mula selected before we get to the pre- clinical safety studies and so forth so it can all be done on the to-be-marketed formulation. We don't have to worry about bridging studies afterwards. So good formulation development up front, and then you go to the races with your selected formulation; you don't have to loop back. Process development is the road map for scale-up. Our formulators think about it during the whole formulation develop- ment process; but after the formula is selected we want to identify the critical parameters such as, order of addition, mixing speed, droplet size, temperature changes and so forth and develop in process tests that allow us to control the process as we graduate from lab to pilot and take it to scale-up at a manufacturer. In Summary To be successful it is important to invest the time to develop a good for- mulation at the beginning. Don't try to formulate if you're not an expert or if you don't have an expert at your side. People who are passionate about their work, and focused on being the best at what they do, make the best part- ners. There have been, and will con- tinue to be, a lot of opportunities for well-managed boutique organizations to demonstrate the advantages of their experience and expertise.

The disintegration properties of some films were also de- termined using an apparatus that enabled testing of up to 24 films simultaneously, either as individual films or as multi-ple locations on individual films. This apparatus con-sisted of two acetal resin blocks, each containing a 4 x 6 array of 5/8-inch-diam-eter (approximately 1.6 cm) wells. The films to be tested were securely held between the blocks. The wells in the bottom section of the testing block contained a small aliquot (5 mL) of de-ionized water along with a small stainless steel ball bearing. The water in the wells was brought to the desired temperature using a temperature-controlled water bath. For testing, the block was removed from the water bath, films were placed over the wells, and the blocks were clamped together. After inverting the apparatus, the water and ball bearings came in contact with the films. A video camera was used to collect images of the wells as a function of time (see Figure 2). Using this process, both the film breakthrough time and disintegration time could be detected. The break-through time was taken to be the time when the water began to appear in the bottom half of the well; the disintegration time was taken to be the time at which the ball bearing appeared at the bottom of the well. This also is illus-trated in Figure 2. A small amount of food coloring was added to the water for improved visualization of the breakthrough and dis-integration times.

These data show that disintegration time versus film thickness is a much better fit statistically to a two-de-gree polynomial than to a linear model. A lack-of-fit test was performed on both linear and two-degree polynomial fits to examine the adequacy of the model fit. During lack-of-fit tests, a p-value, which is a statistical significance term, can be calculated. If it is less than 0.05 at a 95% confidence level, it indicates that the model does not fit well. The lin-ear fit in Figure 3a has a p-value of 0.033, which indicates a lack of fit. The two-degree polynomial fit, indicated with a green line, gives a better fit, with a high p-value of 0.175. Furthermore, the normalized disintegration time (i.e., disin-tegration time divided by film thickness) was found to have a linear dependence on film thickness as shown in Figure 3b. Similar results were obtained in another buffer at much lower pH (KCl/HCl buffer medium, pH=1.2) as shown in Figures 3c and 3d. A possible explanation for these observations lies in the mechanism of polymer disintegration in solution. The mechanism of polymer disintegration for HPMC films is thought to involve solvent (i.e., water) diffusion into the glassy polymer, which plasticizes the polymer, forming a gel-like swollen layer. With time, the gelation front pro-gresses from the original polymer-solvent interface toward the interior of the film. The disintegration of the swollen polymer chains can be explained by polymer relaxation (i.e., reptation), which causes a gradual disentanglement of the polymer chains and subsequent disintegration into the sur-rounding solvent (14-17). The observation of a quadratic dependence of disintegration time on film thickness for HPMC films suggests that the initial water diffusion is the rate-limiting step in the disintegration process. The well-known expression relating water diffusion through the film is shown in Equation 1 (i.e., Fick's law in one dimension): C 2C= Dx2t Eq. 1 where C = concentration of water in polymer, t = time, D = the diffusion coefficient, and x = position (18). The solution of Equation 1 is: C(x,t) = C1[] C1 - C0C1 - 2 where C1= Cwater(x = 0,t) = Cwater(x = l, t) in which l = film thickness, C0 = Cwater (x, t = 0), and erf = error function. Assuming C0 is small compared to C1, Equation 2 reduces to: C(x,t) = C1[ ] x 1 - x2- erf - erf 2Dt 2Dt Eq. 3 The error function can be expanded in a Taylor series as shown in Equation 4: ] [= C12-3 x x2- erf - erf 2Dt 2Dt Eq. 4 Assuming at t = T, C(h, T) = C2, where C2 is the critical concentration of water that makes the film disintegrate, and the diffusion length h 2Dt>> , then C( h, T) can be approximated with the first three terms of the Taylor series. The diffusion length can be derived as shown in Equation 5: [ [ [ { { {[h= 2DT 321 22 22 941 3C2 C1 4 C2 C1++- 2 22 944 C2 C1-2 [ [ [ [ {{ { 1 22 22 943 C2 C1++- 2 22 944 C2 C1-2 Eq. 5 Because = film thickness/2, then T (thickness)2. This sim- plified calculation indicates that the disintegration time for the films studied has a quadratic dependence on thickness, consis-tent with disintegration time being controlled by water diffusion. Similar conclusions can be drawn from a study done on a much more extensive set of samples. The dependence of film disintegration time on film thickness for Polymer A and Polymer B films is shown in Figure 4a. In this case, the dis-integration times were determined using the 24-well block system described earlier (see Figure 2). The absolute value of the disintegration time of the films appeared to be longer using the 24-well apparatus, presumably because the film is exposed to solution on only one side of the film. Neverthe-less, a quadratic relationship between disintegration time and film thickness was again observed. Similarly, the disintegra-tion time normalized by film thickness also showed a linear relationship with film thickness (see Figure 4b). In the case of one-sided exposure of the film to a dis- solving solution, the water diffuses from the polymer/water interface, x = 0, C water (x = 0, t) = C1, to x = h, Cwater = C2 at t = T, where h is at the center of the film and C2 is the critical concentration of water that makes film disintegrate. Follow-ing Fick's second law, the solution of Equation 1 under this current boundary condition is shown in Equation 6: Eq. 6C (x,t) C11erf2n n!(2n+1) x 2Dt 2 x 2Dt- ...x C11 Dt2 3+ + 70 Pharmaceutical Technology MAY 2012 PharmTech.comAssuming at t = T, C( h, T) = C2, and the diffusion length h 2Dt>> , then C( h, T) can be approximated with the first three terms of the Taylor series, and the diffusion length can be derived as shown in Equation 7: [ [ [ [ {{ {h= 2DT 311 22 12 921 C1++- 2 12 924 C2 C1-2 [ [ [ { { { 1 923 C2 C1++- [2 12 924 C2 C1-2 = film thickness/2, then T (thickness)2. This simplified calculation again indicates the quadratic de-pendence of disintegration time on film thickness, even though the absolute values for disintegration time are different, as seen by comparing Equation 7 to Equation 5. This is consistent with the experimental results shown in Figure 4 (disintegration time for 4 mil (4 x 10 -3 in.) is approximately 200 s) and Figure 3 (disintegration time for 4 mil is approximately 50 s). Figure 4 represents media contact on just one side of the sample and Figure 3 rep-resents contact on two sides. In either case the disinte-gration time appears to be controlled by water diffusion through the film. Impact of media temperature on disintegration time. In addi- tion to film thickness, it also is important to understand Figure 4: (a) Dependence of film disintegration time on film thickness for Polymer A/Polymer B films using high-throughput dissolution testing.

In general, it is expected that the dis-integration time of these films will decrease as the media temperature is elevated. Indeed, for gelatin cap-sules, the normalized disintegra-tion time was observed to decrease linearly as temperature increased in both KH 2PO4/NaOH buffer me- dium (pH = 5.8) and KCl/HCl buf-fer medium (pH = 1.2), as shown in Figures 5a and 5b. These results are consistent with an earlier study that also demonstrated a faster disinte-gration of gelatin capsules at higher temperatures (19). The decrease of the disintegration time of gelatin capsules as a function of tempera-ture was explained by the gradual loss of gelatin strength as gelatin polymers denature near 37 to 40 \u00b0C by unzipping the triple helix along its length (20). Because HPMC is a naturally de- rived cellulosic material, it is not sub-ject to any denaturing reaction, and therefore is expected to show very lit-tle dependence of disintegration time on media temperature. As expected, the normalized disintegration time of HPMC capsules (see Figures 6a and 6b) measured in this study was not nearly as sensitive to tempera-ture as that of gelatin capsules (see Figures 5a and 5b). Regardless of the pH of the dissolution media, HPMC showed far less tendency to have a temperature-dependent disintegra-tion time over the temperature range studied, except for a small decrease in disintegration time at 40 \u00b0C. This behavior at 40 \u00b0C is in contrast with Jones's findings, because HPMC cap-sules did not show faster disintegra-tion at 40 \u00b0C (19).

The differ-ence in disintegration time at 40 \u00b0C between the HPMC film and HPMC capsules was caused by gelling agents in the capsule formulation. Conclusion The disintegration time of HPMC Polymer A and Polymer B films was shown to have a quadratic dependence on film thickness in both KH2PO4/NaOH buffer medium (pH = 5.8) and KCl/HCl buffer medium (pH = 1.2). This observa-tion is consistent with a water-diffusion dominated disin-tegration mechanism, at least for HPMC films ranging in thickness from 1-6 mil (0.025-0.152 mm). Similar results were obtained for disintegration of films exposed to water as the dissolution medium on only one side. These results are in contrast to what has been observed in many polymer dissolution systems that involve Case II diffusion, which is characterized by linear dependence on thickness (14,15,17). Consistent with previously published results, the nor- malized disintegration time of gelatin capsules was shown to linearly decrease as temperature increased from 36-40 \u00b0C (19). This decrease as a function of temperature can be explained by the gradual loss of gelatin strength as the gelatin polymer denatures (i.e., unzips the triple helix along its length) at around 37-40 \u00b0C. The normalized disin-tegration time of HPMC capsules, how-ever, showed little temperature depen-dence below 40 \u00b0C but a small decrease in disintegration time at 40 \u00b0C. These results suggest that lower molecular weight HPMC capsules and films exhibit a broader temperature window for con-sistent disintegration time than gelatin, which is important for consistent drug release because patients swallow medi-cines with liquids at temperatures from 10-55 \u00b0C (6).

It can prevent redevelopment or revalidation of a stability indicating analytical method. This paper outlines the scientific aspects of forced degradation studies that should be considered in relation to ANDA submissions.

Disclaimer : The views and opinions in this article are only those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views or policies of the US Food and Drug Administration. FDA Perspectives: Forced Degradation Studies Forced degradation is synonymous with stress testing and purposeful degradation. Purposeful degradation can be a useful tool to predict the stability of a drug substance or a drug product with effects on purity, potency, and safety. It is imperative to know the impurity profile and behavior of a drug substance under various stress conditions. Forced degradation also plays an impor-tant role in the development of analytical methods, setting specifications, and design of formulations under the quality-by-design (QbD) paradigm. The nature of the stress testing depends on the individual drug substance and the type of drug product (e.g., solid oral dosage, lyophilized powders, and liquid formulations) involved (1). The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Q1B guideline provides guidance for performing photosta-bility stress testing; however, there are no additional stress study recommendations in the ICH stability or validation guidelines (2). There is also limited information on the details about the study of oxidation and hydrolysis. The drug substance monographs of Analytical Profiles of Drug Substances and Excipients provide some information with respect to different stress conditions of various drug sub-stances (3). The forced degradation information provided in the ab- breviated new drug application (ANDA) submissions is often incomplete and in those cases deficiencies are cited. An overview of common deficiencies cited throughout the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) section of the ANDAs has been published (4 -6). Some examples of commonly cited deficiencies related to forced degradation studies include the following: t\u0001Your drug substance does not show any degradation under any of the stress conditions. Please repeat stress studies to obtain adequate degradation. If degradation is not achievable, please provide your rationale. t\u0001Please note that the conditions employed for stress study are too harsh and that most of your drug substance has Scientific Considerations of Forced Degradation Studies in ANDA Submissions Ragine Maheswaran74 Pharmaceutical Technology MAY 2012 PharmTech.comdegraded. Please repeat your stress studies using milder conditions or shorter exposure time to generate relevant degradation products. t\u0001It is noted that you have analyzed your stressed samples as per the assay method conditions. For the related sub-stances method to be stability indicating, the stressed samples should be analyzed using related substances method conditions. t\u0001Please state the attempts you have made to ensure that all the impurities including the degradation products of the unstressed and the stressed samples are captured by your analytical method. t\u0001Please provide a list summarizing the amount of degra-dation products (known and unknown) in your stressed samples. t\u0001Please verify the peak height requirement of your soft-ware for the peak purity determination. t\u0001Please explain the mass im balance of the stressed samples. t\u0001Please identify the degradation products that are formed due to drug-excipient interactions. t\u0001Your photostability study shows that the drug product is very sensitive to light. Please explain how this is reflected in the analytical method, manufacturing process, product handling, etc. In an attempt to minimize deficiencies in the ANDA sub- missions, some general recommendations to conduct forced degradation studies, to report relevant information in the submission, and to utilize the knowledge of forced degrada-tion in developing stability indicating analytical methods, manufacturing process, product handling, and storage are provided in this article. Stress conditions Typical stress tests include four main degradation mecha-nisms: heat, hydrolytic, oxidative, and photolytic degrada-tion. Selecting suitable reagents such as the concentration of acid, base, or oxidizing agent and varying the conditions (e.g., temperature) and length of exposure can achieve the preferred level of degradation. Over-stressing a sample may lead to the formation of secondary degradants that would not be seen in formal shelf-life stability studies and under-stressing may not serve the purpose of stress testing. There-fore, it is necessary to control the degradation to a desired level. A generic approach for stress testing has been pro-posed to achieve purposeful degradation that is predictive of long-term and accelerated storage conditions (7). The gener-ally recommended degradation varies between 5-20% deg-radation (7 -10). This range covers the generally permissible 10% degradation for small molecule pharmaceutical drug products, for which the stability limit is 90%-110% of the label claim. Although there are references in the literature that mention a wider recommended range (e.g., 10-30%), the more extreme stress conditions often provide data that are confounded with secondary degradation products. Photostability. Photostability testing should be an inte- gral part of stress testing, especially for photo-labile com-pounds. Some recommended conditions for photostability testing are described in ICH Q1B Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products (2). Samples of drug substance, and solid/liquid drug product, should be ex-posed to a minimum of 1.2 million lux hours and 200 watt hours per square meter light. The same samples should be exposed to both white and UV light. To minimize the effect of temperature changes during exposure, tempera-ture control may be necessary. The light-exposed samples should be analyzed for any changes in physical properties such as appearance, clarity, color of solution, and for assay and degradants. The decision tree outlined in the ICH Q1B can be used to determine the photo stability testing condi-tions for drug products. The product labeling should reflect the appropriate storage conditions. It is also important to note that the labeling for generic drug products should be concordant with that of the reference listed drug (RLD) and with United States Pharmacopeia (USP) monograph recommendations, as applicable. Heat. Thermal stress testing (e.g., dry heat and wet heat) should be more strenuous than recommended ICH Q1A accelerated testing conditions. Samples of solid-state drug substances and drug products should be exposed to dry and wet heat, whereas liquid drug products can be exposed to dry heat. It is recommended that the effect of temperature be studied in 10 \u00baC increments above that for routine ac-celerated testing, and humidity at 75% relative humidity or greater (1). Studies may be conducted at higher temperatures for a shorter period (10). Testing at multiple time points could provide information on the rate of degradation and primary and secondary degradation products. In the event that the stress conditions produce little or no degradation due to the stability of a drug molecule, one should ensure that the stress applied is in excess of the energy applied by accelerated conditions (40 \u00baC for 6 months) before terminat-ing the stress study. Acid and base hydrolysis. Acid and base hydrolytic stress testing can be carried out for drug substances and drug products in solution at ambient temperature or at elevated temperatures. The selection of the type and concentrations of an acid or a base depends on the stability of the drug sub- Over-stressing a sample may lead to the formation of secondary degradants that would not be seen in formal shelf-life stability studies.FDA Perspectives: Forced Degradation StudiesFor questions contact Sara dorf at sbarsch dorf@advanstar .com Register free at http://www.pharmtech.com/metal SCREENING METHODS FOR ELEMENTAL IMPURITIES Proposed Compendial Requirements LIVE WEBCAST : Thursday, June 14 at 11:00am EDT EVENT OVERVIEW : The revised US Pharmacopeia revised chapters on elemen- tal impurity limits and procedures (<232> and <233>) are to be published as final in June 2012 and will become offi- cial by the end of the year.

A strategy for generating relevant stressed samples for hydrolysis is stated as subjecting the drug substance so-lution to various pHs (e.g., 2, 7, 10 -12) at room temperature for two weeks or up to a maximum of 15% degradation (7). Hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid (0.1 M to 1 M) for acid hydrolysis and sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide (0.1 M to 1 M) for base hydrolysis are suggested as suit-able reagents for hydrolysis (10). For lipophilic drugs, inert co-solvents may be used to solubilize the drug substance. Attention should be given to the functional groups pres-ent in the drug molecule when selecting a co-solvent. Prior knowledge of a compound can be useful in selecting the stress conditions. For instance, if a compound contains ester functionality and is very labile to base hydrolysis, low con-centrations of a base can be used. Analysis of samples at various intervals can provide information on the progress of degradation and help to distinguish primary degradants from secondary degradants. Oxidation. Oxidative degradation can be complex. Al- though hydrogen peroxide is used predominantly because it mimics possible presence of peroxides in excipients, other oxidizing agents such as metal ions, oxygen, and radical ini-tiators (e.g., azobisisobutyronitrile, AIBN) can also be used. Selection of an oxidizing agent, its concentration, and con-ditions depends on the drug substance. Solutions of drug substances and solid/liquid drug products can be subjected to oxidative degradation. It is reported that subjecting the solutions to 0.1%-3% hydrogen peroxide at neutral pH and room temperature for seven days or up to a maximum 20% degradation could potentially generate relevant degradation products (10). Samples can be analyzed at different time in-tervals to determine the desired level of degradation. Different stress conditions may generate the same or different degradants. The type and extent of degradation depend on the functional groups of the drug molecule and the stress conditions. Analysis method The preferred method of analysis for a stability indicating assay is reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatog-raphy (HPLC). Reverse-phase HPLC is preferred for several reasons, such as its compatibility with aqueous and organic solutions, high precision, sensitivity, and ability to detect polar compounds. Separation of peaks can be carried out by selecting appropriate column type, column tempera-ture, and making adjustment to mobile phase pH. Poorly-retained, highly polar impurities should be resolved from the solvent front. As part of method development, a gradi-ent elution method with varying mobile phase composition (very low organic composition to high organic composition) may be carried out to capture early eluting highly polar com-pounds and highly retained nonpolar compounds. Stressed samples can also be screened with the gradient method to assess potential elution pattern. Sample solvent and mobile phase should be selected to afford compatibility with the drug substance, potential impurities, and degradants. Stress sample preparation should mimic the sample preparation outlined in the analytical procedure as closely as possible. Neutralization or dilution of samples may be necessary for acid and base hydrolyzed samples. Chromatographic pro-files of stressed samples should be compared to those of rel-evant blanks (containing no active) and unstressed samples to determine the origin of peaks. The blank peaks should be excluded from calculations. The amount of impurities (known and unknown) obtained under each stress condi-tion should be provided along with the chromatograms (full scale and expanded scale showing all the peaks) of blanks, unstressed, and stressed samples. Additionally, chiral drugs should be analyzed with chiral methods to establish stereo-chemical purity and stability (11, 12). The analytical method of choice should be sensitive enough to detect impurities at low levels (i.e., 0.05% of the analyte of interest or lower), and the peak responses should fall within the range of detector's linearity. The analytical method should be capable of capturing all the impurities formed during a formal stability study at or below ICH threshold limits (13, 14). Degradation product identifica-tion and characterization are to be performed based on formal stability results in accordance with ICH require-ments. Conventional methods (e.g., column chromatogra-phy) or hyphenated techniques (e.g., LC -MS, LC -NMR) can be used in the identification and characterization of the degradation products. Use of these techniques can pro-vide better insight into the structure of the impurities that could add to the knowledge space of potential structural alerts for genotoxicity and the control of such impurities with tighter limits (12 -17). It should be noted that struc- tural characterization of degradation products is neces-sary for those impurities that are formed during formal shelf-life stability studies and are above the qualification threshold limit (13). Various detection types can be used to analyze stressed samples such as UV and mass spectroscopy. The detector should contain 3D data capabilities such as diode array de-tectors or mass spectrometers to be able to detect spectral non-homogeneity. Diode array detection also offers the pos-sibility of checking peak profile for multiple wavelengths. The limitation of diode array arises when the UV profiles FDA Perspectives: Forced Degradation Studies Establishing peak purity is not an absolute proof that the peak is pure and that there is no co-elution with the peak of interest.Where Small Molecule Pharma & Biotech Chemists Meetwww.chemoutsourcing.comSeptember 10-13, 2012 Ocean Place Resort - Long Branch, NJPharma Want to Meet Chemical Buyers? 78 Pharmaceutical Technology MAY 2012 PharmTech.comare similar for analyte peak and impurity or degradant peak and the noise level of the system is high to mask the co-eluting impurities or degradants. Compounds of similar molecular weights and functional groups such as diaste-reoisomers may exhibit similar UV profiles. In such cases, attempts must be made to modify the chromatographic parameters to achieve necessary separation. An optimal wavelength should be selected to detect and quantitate all the potential impurities and degradants. Use of more than one wavelength may be necessary, if there is no overlap in the UV profile of an analyte and impurity or degradant peaks. A valuable tool in method development is the overlay of separation signals at different wavelengths to discover dissimilarities in peak profiles. Peak purity analysis. Peak purity is used as an aid in stabil- ity indicating method development. The spectral unique-ness of a compound is used to establish peak purity when co-eluting compounds are present. Peak purity or peak homogeneity of the peaks of interest of unstressed and stressed samples should be established using spectral information from a diode array detector. When instrument software is used for the determination of spectral purity of a peak, relevant parameters should be set up in accordance with the manufacturer's guidance. Attention should be given to the peak height requirement for establishing spectral purity. UV detection becomes non linear at higher absorbance values. Thresholds should be set such that co-eluting peaks can be detected. Optimum location of reference spectra should also be selected. The ability of the software to automatically correct spectra for continuously changing solvent background in gradient separations should be ascertained. Establishing peak purity is not an absolute proof that the peak is pure and that there is no co-elution with the peak of interest. Limitations to peak purity arise when co-eluting peaks are spectrally similar, or below the detection limit, or a peak has no chromophore, or when they are not resolved at all. Mass balance. Mass balance establishes adequacy of a sta- bility indicating method though it is not achievable in all circumstances. It is performed by adding the assay value and the amounts of impurities and degradants to evaluate the closeness to 100% of the initial value (unstressed assay value) with due consideration of the margin of analytical error (1). Some attempt should be made to establish a mass balance for all stressed samples. Mass imbalance should be explored and an explanation should be provided. Varying responses of analyte and impurity peaks due to differences in UV absorption should also be examined by the use of external standards. Potential loss of volatile impurities, formation of non-UV absorbing compounds, formation of early elu-ants, and potential retention of compounds in the column should be explored. Alternate detection techniques such as RI LC/MS may be employed to account for non-UV absorb-ing degradants. Termination of study Stress testing could be terminated after ensuring adequate exposure to stress conditions. Typical activation energy of drug substance molecules varies from 12- 24 kcal/mol (18). A compound may not necessarily degrade under every single stress condition, and general guideline on exposure limit is cited in a review article (10). In circumstances where some stable drugs do not show any degradation under any of the stress conditions, specificity of an analytical method can be established by spiking the drug substance or placebo with known impurities and establishing adequate separation. Other considerations Stress testing may not be necessary for drug substances and drug products that have pharmacopeial methods and are used within the limitations outlined in USP <621>. In the case where a generic drug product uses a different poly-morphic form from the RLD, the drug substance should be subjected to stress testing to evaluate the physiochemical changes of the polymorphic form because different poly-morphic forms may exhibit different stability character-istics. Forced degradation in QbD paradigm A systematic process of manufacturing quality drug prod-ucts that meet the predefined targets for the critical quality attributes (CQA) necessitates the use of knowledge obtained in forced degradation studies. A well-designed, forced degradation study is indispens- able for analytical method development in a QbD paradigm. It helps to establish the specificity of a stability indicating method and to predict potential degradation products that could form during formal stability studies. Incorporating all potential impurities in the analytical method and estab-lishing the peak purity of the peaks of interest helps to avoid unnecessary method re-development and revalidation. Knowledge of chemical behavior of drug substances under various stress conditions can also provide useful in-formation regarding the selection of excipients for formu-lation development. Excipient compatibility is an integral part of understanding potential formulation interactions during product development and is a key part of product understanding. Degradation products due to drug-excipient interaction or drug-drug interaction in combination prod-ucts can be examined by stressing samples of drug sub-stance, drug product, and placebo separately and compar-Knowledge gained in forced degradation studies can facilitate improvements in the manufacturing process. FDA Perspectives: Forced Degradation StudiesRemember your rst chemistry set? We do. Over the last 35 years we've been keeping an eye on you, proudly watching you grow into the most powerful and influential readership in the industry. We hope that by providing the insights and information you need to achieve your goals we might have something to do with that success. CELEBRATING YEARS impurity profiles. Information obtained regarding drug-related peaks and non-drug-related peaks can be used in the selection and development of more stable formula-tions. For instance, if a drug substance is labile to oxida-tion, addition of an antioxidant may be considered for the formulation. For drug substances that are labile to acid or undergo stereochemical conversion in acidic medium, delayed-release formulations may be necessary. Acid/base hydrolysis testing can also provide useful insight in the for- mulation of drug products that are liquids or suspensions. Knowledge gained in forced degradation studies can facilitate improvements in the manufacturing process. If a photostability study shows a drug substance to be photo-labile, caution should be taken during the manufacturing process of the drug product. Useful information regard-ing process development (e.g., wet versus dry processing, temperature selection) can be obtained from thermal stress testing of drug substance and drug product. Additionally, increased scientific understanding of deg- radation products and mechanisms may help to determine the factors that could contribute to stability failures such as ambient temperature, humidity, and light. Appropriate selection of packaging materials can be made to protect against such factors. Conclusion An appropriately-designed stress study meshes well with the QbD approaches currently being promoted in the pharmaceutical industry. A well-designed stress study can provide insight in choosing the appropriate formulation for a proposed product prior to intensive formulation de-velopment studies. A thorough knowledge of degradation, including mechanistic understanding of potential degrada-tion pathways, is the basis of a QbD approach for analytical method development and is crucial in setting acceptance criteria for shelf-life monitoring. Stress testing can provide useful insight into the selection of physical form, stereo-chemical stability of a drug substance, packaging, and stor-age conditions. It is important to perform stress testing for generic drugs due to allowable qualitative and quantitative differences in formulation with respect to the RLD, selec-tion of manufacturing process, processing parameters, and packaging materials.

The author discusses potential oppo rtunities to improve the patient experience through formulation and delivery device technologies. Bart. E.

MARIA TOUTOUDAKI/GETTY IMAGESDrug Delivery In an ideal world, patients with chronic conditions could take a single pill once a year or undergo a one-time non-invasive treatment that is administered without the need for a hospital or doctor visit. Unfortunately, treatment regimens for many of today's most prevalent chronic condi-tions, such as cancer, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases, require multiple, repeated doses of drug at frequent and regular intervals. Opportunities for improvement There are opportunities, however, to improve the patient experience using formulation and delivery device technolo-gies. Treatment regimens can be optimized, for example, by: formulating drugs to higher concentrations to reduce dosing frequency; using higher-volume delivery systems to deliver a larger volume and reduce dosing frequency; and using higher-volume systems. To give an example, monoclonal antibody (mAb) drug products have been approved for human therapeutic use for more than 20 years and affect a diverse range of therapeu-tics targets, including indications for prophylaxis of organ rejection following transplant, cancer, and various autoim-mune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, and psoriasis). Most of these approved mAb products are intended for use in an acute care setting and must be administered through intravenous (IV) infusion. These accommodations are necessary because of the need for weight-based dosing of some products due to the poten-tial for toxicity at higher doses; the potential for anaphylaxis or other adverse reaction; and the need for concurrent ad-ministration of other drugs intravenously, as with certain chemotherapeutic regimens. There are, however, approved products intended for self- injection by patients, usually for autoimmune diseases like those previously mentioned. These include several TNF- antibody products such as Johnson & Johnson's Simponi and Abbott Laboratories' Humira. These injections are typically designed for delivery into the subcutaneous space. Attri-butes of these products have allowed for self-administration, including a relatively low dose (< 100 mg) for efficacy and a reduced risk of life-threatening adverse reaction. Both Sim-poni and Humira are packaged in 1-mL in length prefilled Optimizing Drug Delivery for Modern Biologics Bart E.

These are polyester-based polymers that are biodegradable and are completely resorbable via metabolic pathways in human tissue. Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are encapsu- lated within the polymeric matrix par ticles (micro or nano) by emulsion-based processes, spray-drying or melt extrusion. The API is released in a controlled sustained manner via molecular diffusion through the polymeric barrier that is eroding due to hydrolysis and metabolism at the site of injection. The release is tailored through the copolymer c omposition, molecular weight, end groups, drug loading, particle size and distribution, allowing endless number of excipients engineered to the desired profile. Parenteral controlled-release manufacturing processes are inherently complex to develop and scale up. These applications often deal with novel and non-compendial excipients with unique physical and chemical properties in multi step pr ocesses. This webinar will provide guidance to successful process devel- opment and commercialization strategies through risk-manage- ment assessment. Critical processing parameters and quality attributes as related to controlled-release parenteral products will be presented.

In the case of most TNF- therapies, the therapeutic tar- get and properties of the antibodies used have allowed for relatively easy formulation and manufacturing because the final product viscosity is low (less than five centipoise) and because the product can be delivered through commonly available and well-characterized prefillable syringe systems. However, as pharmaceutical companies develop and test an-tibodies for new therapeutic products, often in the search for better efficacy and reduced side effects, challenges can arise. In cases where the dose required for efficacy is significantly higher than currently approved self-injected products, for example, one must choose between more frequent subcuta-neous injections and clinically administered IV infusion. Addressing the challenges Potential solutions would be to increase the dose concentration to fit within the classic 1-mL volume limitation, or to expand the dose to a larger volume. Concentration has apparently been the choice for many products to date because dosages have in-creased in the cases of products like Bristol-Myers Squibb's Orencia, although the 1-mL paradigm has not been broken. In fact, some recently introduced self-injected products, such as UCB's Cimzia, have concentrations of up to 200 mg/mL. The exponential relationship between product concen- tration and viscosity, which often becomes readily appar-ent above 100 mg/mL, may limit this strategy significantly because the product either may not be deliverable by self-injection or may not be amenable to existing fill-finish processes if it is too viscous. Concentration to the neces-sary level in the final product may not be possible for all products because in many cases, upstream purification and manufacturing processes may limit the maximum concen-tration for the final drug product more than delivery and fill-finish process concerns. Additionally, drug-product properties, such as pH and osmolality, along with the use of certain excipients, may limit the most appropriate drug-product concentration. These properties may need to be kept within certain ranges to prevent patient discomfort and site reaction upon injection. Certain emerging formulation tech-nologies, including the use of nonaqueous solutions, have shown promise towards mitigating such concerns, but are awaiting regulatory approval. Increasing the administered volume of drug product of- fers the ability to deliver a larger dose, but this approach can have disadvantages. There are limitations to how rapidly a volume of drug can be injected subcutaneously. Although the optimal injection time may vary greatly by individual drug product, and the literature regarding the relationship between injection volume and speed is limited, the subcu-taneous space cannot necessarily tolerate rapidly injecting larger and larger dose volumes as tissue disruption and site reaction may occur. Second, if the injection is rapid and the volume is too large, there is potential for the product to leak back from the injection site, reducing the bioavailability relative to the total dose. Lastly, a larger volume of product may require a larger device for self-delivery, and, potentially, a longer injection time, neither of which is likely to be desir-able, especially in a crowded therapeutic class. A potential solution to large-volume injection challenges is the development and use of systems that administer the dose into the subcutaneous space more slowly. Such sys-tems have the potential to expand the possibilities for self-injection. Due to the longer duration of injection, the device or system may need to be temporarily attached to the body at an appropriate injection site; thus, the current industry interest in patch-injection technologies. Such systems use a bladder, cartridge, or other container for the drug product, which may either be prefilled or user-filled. The mechanism to force the drug product into the body may be purely mechanical or electromechanical. Due to the widely varying properties of drug products, which can influence the optimal injection time, systems should be easily adaptable to the demands of the drug-product devel-oper (e.g., changing the system mechanism or varying the programming of an electromechanical system). Patch-injector systems specifically can potentially allow for less frequent administration of products already approved for self-injection and for porting of products approved for IV administration to subcutaneous self-injection. In the case of the former, a larger dose can be given by a single injection less frequently than currently approved, more frequent regimens, except in the case where dose-limiting toxicities may exist. The latter can be performed by concentrating the existing formu-lation or by using the already formulated dosage strength in conjunction with a larger-volume injection. Technologies that allow for delivery of higher drug product doses may be applicable to certain emerging needs for mAb products. For instance, the potential to coformulate (i.e., con-taining more than one mAb product in a single dose), may be a significant area of investigation to create next-generation therapeutic options. A major limitation for some solutions is viscosity, which can be significantly higher than would be expected for a normal mAb solution. The ability to deliver such products in higher volumes may increase the attractive-ness of pursuing combination drug products. Conclusion In conclusion, the development of mAb products to address patient needs is complicated by the many physical and chemi-cal factors inherent to such drug-product solutions. Limita-tions imposed by existing formulation strategies and the dose volume that can be delivered by devices may make some prod-ucts less attractive than currently approved therapies or less likely to gain user acceptance, even in areas of unmet need. Innovative delivery systems that address the challenges of higher-volume delivery may enable drug manufacturers to develop products that use more desirable dosing and IV administration regimens.

Kurt Nielsen, PhD and senior vice-president of innovation and growth with Catalent Pharma Solutions, dis-cusses strategies to address key challenges, such as bioavail-ability and solubility enhancement and the related drug-delivery solutions. A recorded podcast of this discussion may be found at www.PharmTech.com/podcasts. Question: In a recent Pharmaceutical Technology - Catalent survey, bioavailability was identified as a top challenge in formulation development, with almost two-thirds of respondents encountering problems with respect to bioavailability and solubility. What are some key strategies to enhance solubility and bioavailability in solid dosage forms? Nielsen: It can be thought of along two dimensions. In developing a highly soluble drug, first take a look at the drug substance and then consider what can be done with the drug product. When dealing with the drug substance, there's certainly some proven strategies to improve the solubility of the drug substance through optimizing the salt form or solid-state form, including a different polymorph or co-crystal. You also can make slight modifications to the drug to improve its solubility by converting to a prodrug. And certainly, a well-tested and proven strategy is to reduce the particle size of the drug substance. In looking at the other dimension in terms of the drug product, there are a number of strategies to consider. A simpler, more straightforward strategy would be to use solubilizing agents, such as surfactants or polymers. More complex solutions like site-specific delivery would be needed to address poor stability of the drug in the stomach or presystemic metabolism in certain locations in the GI tract. In addition, particle engineering can be used to improve solubility, as well as modify and control the drug release. The formulator's focus is on improving solubility, permeability, and targeting the site of absorption. There are a variety of proven approaches to solve these challenges utilizing liquid-based dosage forms, including softgels, dispersion dosage forms, including hot-melt extrusion and spray-drying, as well as particle engineering using fluid bed drug layering and coating. If the desired bioavailablility cannot be achieved, alternate routes of administration, such as transdermal, buccal, or sublingual delivery, can be used to avoid the first-pass effect. A few key considerations are to ensure the stability of the drug product and know the patent landscape for the various technologies that you are using. It is important to build quality into the formulation and manufacturing process at the earliest stages of development.

Drug Delivery Insights (QbD) starts at early formulation development and ultimately allows the product to be reliably supplied for clinical studies as well as the commercial marketplace. Question: The survey also showed increased interest in spe- cific product forms, such as liquid-filled hard capsules. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this product form? Nielsen. There are big advantages with a liquid-based dosage form, especially in preclinical development when trying to quickly reach first-in-human studies and knowing the drug substance is dissolved in the liquid carrier. A liquid-filled capsule avoids critical steps with solid oral dosage forms, whereby the tablet needs to disintegrate and the drug needs to dissolve before it can be ab-sorbed. There are benefits to having a short T max (i.e., short time to the maximum concentration in the blood). In addition, a product can quickly get to proof of concept because the formulator is working with fairly simple and straightforward equipment. The small-scale equipment for liquid-based dosage forms is readily available. Liquid-based dosage forms can be used on small amounts of drug, and you have a high degree of assurance that you will have dose uniformity and improve the quality of data from pharmacokinetic (PK) studies. The formulator also needs to consider the limitations on drug loading, patent landscape, and stability of the drug When comparing liquid-based dosage forms, such as softgels, to powder in a capsule, or even a tablet, they certainly have many of the same advantages in their proven flexibility and breadth of application. With powder-filled capsules, one of the disadvantages is that the powder-filling process itself can be fairly complex. You can have challenges with the flow of the powder in the manu-facturing process, which can lead to dose-uniformity questions. You don't have that challenge with the liquid-based dosage form. When working with a tablet, more steps have to occur before the drug can be absorbed into the body and that can complicate interpretation of PK and clinical data, especially when trying to un-derstand if the molecule has an ef ficacy signal and is well-tolerated by patients. Also, for a tablet, additional unit operations are added to get the drug substance into a powder form, which has its chal-lenges in terms of handling. You also have to go through tablet unit operations, and there are certainly some challenges associated with tableting. Moreover, during the tableting process, the drug substance may convert from one polymorphic form to another, thereby creating stability issues. Each tool has its place in the formulator's toolkit, but I think by far the one that has the most advantages for addressing bioavailability challenges is the liquid-based dosage form, such as a softgel. Question: From the survey, tablets are a large area of current project work. One segment within tablets is fast-dissolving or orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs). What factors are considered in using an ODT? Is it largely dictated by the patient population for a given drug or do other delivery-related factors come into play? Nielsen: There are a number of different considerations, and they typically depend on the needs of the target patient popula-tion. For example, in a consumer healthcare application, one of the things that is attractive about an ODT dosage form is that it can be taken without water. That can also be an advantage for a prescrip-tion product for patients with GI upset, anti-emetics for oncology patients, numerous CNS condi-tions or patients with an overac-tive bladder. Use of an ODT can give the caregiver the assurance that the drug was taken, espe-cially if the ODT instantaneously dissolves. There is really no way that the patient can cheek or spit out the tablet. Additionally, bio- availability can be improved if the drug is absorbed sublingually or buccally. In addition, the instantaneous disintegration of lyophilized dosage forms can have a T max that is equivalent to a liquid. One very important point to highlight is that all ODTs are not created equal. These technologies have to meet minimum regulatory standards for disintegration, but they do not have a maximum performance standard. It is very important to know whether or not you need a dosage form that can dissolve in 30 seconds with slight chewing or need a product to dissolve instantaneously as soon as it is put into the mouth. There are substantial performance differences when comparing the in-stantaneous disintegration of a lyophilized ODT to the dissolu-tion of a loosely compressed tablet or even a thin-film strip. Some challenges in working with ODTs, include tastemask- ing and high drug dosing. Both of these factors can limit the breadth of the applications for the ODT. From the earliest stage of development, it is important for formulators to be thought-fully considering stability requirements as well as the patent landscape. Overall, the ODT is a versatile dosage form for Rx and consumer healthcare applications. The formulator's focus is on improving solubility, permeability, and targeting the site of absorption. 90 Pharmaceutical Technology MAY 2012 PharmTech.com OUTSOURCING OUTLOOK JONATHAN EVANS/PHOTODISC/ GETTY IMAGES PharmTech.com/outsource I recently finished reading Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs, the co-founder and visionary leader of Apple. As I read the book, I sought to glean insights on what it was that made Jobs and Apple so fabulously successful over the past 10 years. The answer, the book makes clear, is Job's fanatical and obsessive focus on the user experience: ensuring that Apple products had a broad range of features, were fun and easy to use, and made a statement about the person using them. The superior customer experience that Apple prod-ucts deliver has enabled the company to grow rapidly while commanding higher prices than its competitors and earning the best profit margins in the consumer-electronics industry. For Jobs, one of the fundamental principles for maximizing the user ex-perience was maintaining Apple prod-ucts as closed systems. Apple products are designed as an integrated system such that only hardware and software developed or approved by Apple will work with them, thus ensuring that all elements will work well together. This is in sharp contrast to the PC world, in which computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system can accept peripheral equipment and run software programs from thou-sands of suppliers. The open system environment of the PC world gives the customer far more choices than Apple's closed system, but is more likely to lead to problems, such as system crashes and the inability to print documents because of compatibility problems be-tween the various pieces of hardware and software. The open environment also has led to the commoditization of the products themselves, driving down prices and making the PC world mar-ginally profitable at best. Applying Apple concepts to contract service providers The closed-system idea struck a chord because of its potential relevance to the integrated service model tak-ing hold in the contract services in-dustry. Both large and small bio/ pharmaceutical companies are em-bracing the idea of buying services as a bundle rather than on an individual basis, for example, having the same contractor develop and manufacture early clinical supplies of the drug sub-stance and drug product. For small bio/pharmaceutical companies, the bundled model offers the opportunity to get their development candidates to the proof-of-concept decision point much faster while overcoming their deficiencies in project management and development expertise. For large bio/pharmaceutical companies, buy-ing a package of services promises to reduce the costs of identifying, qualify-ing, and managing a network of service providers by reducing the total number of providers in the network. This trend from the \"open system\" world where bio/pharmaceutical compa-nies themselves had to work out schedul-ing and compatibility issues among ser-vice providers to the \"closed system\" of integrated service providers (ISPs) can be transformational for drug development and for the service providers themselves. For the ISP model to really work, service providers must take ownership of the entire customer experience. So, execu-tives of CROs and CMOs offering a one-stop-model must dedicate themselves to answering three key questions: t\u0001Question 1: How do customers de-fine a superior experience? t\u0001Question 2 : Now that we have all of the elements under our control, what can we do to make them work together to provide the best possible customer experience? t\u0001Question 3 : How do we demon- strate the value of our integrated offering so as to convince the cus-tomer to pay a premium price for it? Precisely defining a superior cus- tomer experience will probably require some market research, and the answer will differ across customer types and service offerings. We can be pretty sure, however, it will center around value, price, meeting deadlines, communi-cation, and technical expertise. Once these have been defined, successful companies will develop metrics to mea-sure them and to manage those metrics. The key to answering the second question is the ability to break down Channeling Steve Jobs Service providers must focus on delivering a superior customer experience. A closed system of integrated service providers reduces functional silos.

The differ-ent functional areas have traditionally \"thrown the project over the wall\" to the next sequential step in the de-velopment process, such as when the process chemists ship the API to the toxicologists for preclinical testing or to the formulators for drug-product development. An ISP focused on the customer experience will ensure that the different functional areas work closely together from the start in both technical matters and project manage-ment and scheduling. For instance, the ISP will have its medicinal chemists and formulators work together early in the process to identify and resolve potential solubility issues. Further, the ISP will use its cumula- tive experience to anticipate and plan for problems the minute a new proj-ect comes in the door, or, even bet-ter, during the request-for-proposal (RFP) process. While every project and compound is undoubtedly dif-ferent, the breadth and depth of ex-perience that most CROs and CMOs claim to have should enable them to know where to expect problems and how to account for them in the project schedule and commitment of re-sources, and to prepare the customer's expectations accordingly. No doubt the key to achieving these objectives is for ISPs to establish multi-discipline project teams to evaluate and manage projects as they come through the door. The multidiscipline approach truly leverages the advantages of hav-ing all elements of the projects in the hands of a single provider. ISPs that do not use multidisciplinary teams are little more than loose confederations of independent service providers. If questions one and two are an- swered successfully, dealing with ques-tion three should be much easier. If the ISP delivers on its promise, it will have no problem getting repeat custom-ers, and its reputation should spread around the industry. A positive score- card of customer experience metrics should help convince new clients that they are choosing the right service pro-vider for their projects. CMO and CRO executives who have not yet read the Jobs biography will be well-advised to do so. While you may not want to mimic his management style, understanding his focus on the customer experience and how to achieve it will serve you and your company well.

Product-development implications Orphan drugs have historically focused on a small, defined market need. Because the population of individuals likely to optimally benefit from any individual drug may be small, drugs produced will be higher cost because drugmakers will have to recoup their investment from a smaller popula-tion of patients. Proving the economic and clinical value of treatment is therefore more crucial for orphan drug. This value case can include elements such as high qual-ity outcomes, better patient experience, sufficiently improved health to allow the patient to more effectively manage other conditions, or product characteristics that improve overall patient adherence. Each of these elements should be explored and planned for early in product development. Because the target population will be smaller, clinical-trial participants may include some people suffering from co-morbidities that would otherwise be ex-cluded from the sample. In this regard, the trial participants begin to look more like people in the real world. As a result, care-ful tracking of all patient outcomes will be crucial. Preparing to track these outcomes will need to start early in product develop-ment and continue postmarket to develop the kind of longitudinal data required to make the case for premium reimbursement rates to payers. Finally, developing more targeted drugs alongside similarly targeted diagnostics will be key. As medicine becomes increas-ingly personalized and diagnostics become more targeted, it will become easier for or-phan-drug makers to identify the popula-tion most likely to benefit from their drug. Developing drugs and diagnostics together will not only improve the likelihood that the drug will be successfully used, but can also improve the likelihood that the drug will be approved. In 2011, two personalized drugs were approved for use in conjunction with a specific diagnostic test\u2014Xalkori (crizotinib) for lung cancer and Zelboraf (vemurafenib) for melanoma (3, 4). A model for success The advantages and benefits of adopt-ing an orphan-drug centric approach reach beyond product development because the smaller population doesn't require large marketing or promotional campaigns. As a result, companies pursuing orphan drugs have adopted different kinds of promotional cam-paigns, often partnering with patient advocacy groups to get in front of their target populations. This kind of commercial model could become the model pharmaceutical manu-facturers adopt increasingly across their portfolios. Orphan-drug manufacturers have historically had to develop a deeper understanding of that population's char-acteristics than drug companies seeking blockbusters. As diagnostics become more targeted and the use of personalized medi-cine grows, companies pursuing all types of drugs will need to understand their target populations better and partner with advo-cacy groups like orphan drug companies have done. Ultimately, the growth of orphan drugs is one element of a larger paradigm shift in the pharmaceutical industry\u2014one that manufacturers will need to adjust to. References 1.

PT106 Pharmaceutical Technology MAY 2012 PharmTech.com PharmTech.com/viewVIEWPOINT DORLING KINDERSLEY/GETTY IMAGES Rita E. Numerof and Michael N. Abrams Historically, orphan drug development has existed on the margins of R&D spend, but increasingly, this product class is attracting attention and value. With the blockbuster model wearing thin, the pressure for lower cost drugs with bet-ter outcomes is gro wing. I t' s time for the industry therefore to diversify its strategic approach. The benefits of shifting focus to orphan drugs are many, including a streamlined approval process, patent extension and exclusivity, tax credits, and smaller clini-cal trials based on narrow indications. But as competition moves into these niche spaces, everyone will be looking for an opportunity to get an orphan-drug des-ignation (ODD). This strategy may lead to additional scrutiny and intensify the need to demonstrate the economic and clinical value of a product as it applies to a particu-lar population before approval. The pursuit of orphan drugs has im- plications for change across the entire business. It will require a new R&D ap-proach that addresses economic and clinical value data, and goes beyond randomized clinical trials for regulatory approval to alternative types of data (e.g., observational or \"real-world\" studies that demonstrate product value over time in real-life scenarios). Companion diagnos-tics used to identify the patient popula-tion most likely to benefit from orphan drugs represent another key area that bio-tech and pharmaceutical developers will need to explore. This area may present licensing and acquisition opportunities on both sides. The growing emphasis on orphan drugs and more targeted diagnostics represent an increasingly personalized approach to medicine in general. An in-evitable impact will be shrinking target patient populations, where the majority of blockbuster drugs will be suitable for a significantly smaller group of patients, the number of whom may well fall within the definition of rare diseases (6-8% of world population) (1). As genomics define specific subpopulations within larger dis-ease conditions (e.g., hypertension), bio/pharmaceutical manufacturers of all sizes will increasingly need to shift to thinking about drug development within the con-text of the orphan model. In this context, companies will have to seek indications for their products within narrower patient populations and build a large population of patients incrementally, rather than as one single, huge population used in the rolling blockbuster model. To develop a successful model based on or-phan drugs, manufacturers will need to adopt a new approach to both product de-velopment and commercialization. Advantages Rising product development costs, stingier public and private reimbursement, and increasing regulatory hurdles mean that companies are struggling more than ever to bring new products to market at prices that sustain ongoing investments in inno-vation. Ongoing waves of blockbuster-drug patent expirations are offering insurers cheap and effective generic drugs. Concur-rently, rare but significant side effects (as in the case of Vioxx) have eroded regulators' willingness to approve drugs for primary care indications without prohibitively large and expensive clinical trials (2). Addition-ally, the situation is complicated by a shift in the balance of power among industry stakeholders, each of which may require different evidence to be convinced of a product's value. Instead of thinking big, innovators need to think small. If a company shrinks the denominator to just the segment of the market that genuinely benefits, then the value element starts to look a lot better. This shift can mitigate business risk, as well. Rather than seeking a single indica-tion for one, large group of patients, the rolling blockbuster approach for orphan drugs segments the market for a drug more minutely, creating a large number of target populations in which the drug's value can be assessed. Such an approach reduces the risk inherent in clinical trials because the binary outcome (reimbursed/not-reimbursed) applies only to the small segment under consideration. The popu-lation becomes the sum of those small segments, eventually comprising a much bigger population. Compared with the bleak landscape of aging blockbusters, the orphan-drug mar-ket is appealing, especially when consider-ing drugs that successfully made the leap from orphan to rolling blockbuster. Take, for example, Botox\u2014a drug approved with orphan status in 1984 to treat uncontrolled blinking, neck pain, and muscle spasms.
