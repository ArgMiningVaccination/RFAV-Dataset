Acupuncture and massage are complementary therapies that address both the physical and energetic aspects of the body. When received in back-to-back sessions, the individual benefits of each therapy can be amplified. Acupuncture can be done either before or after a massage. Your therapist will assess your condition to determine which order best suits your needs. - Yes, we offer post-surgical lymphatic drainage massages. Lymphatic drainage treatments can help to aid the recovery process and reduce pain, swelling, and inflammation. If you are considering a post-surgical massage, it is important to talk to your doctor first. They can help you determine when the best time is for you to begin post-op massage treatments. - Massage therapy has been shown to have a wide range of benefits for both physical and mental well-being. Some of the most common benefits include: Reduced stress and anxiety Improved sleep Reduced pain Improved range of motion Enhanced immune function Increased relaxation - Stay hydrated. We recommend drinking water before and after your lymphatic drainage massage treatment. Don't eat a big meal before your appointment. Opt for a light snack instead. - Our Lymphatic Drainage massages incorporate a specialized machine called the Phyto5 Biodraineur which uses glass cups and suction/repulsion to stimulate lymphatic flow and circulation. As our massage therapists guide the cups over your skin, the Biodraineur will alternatively pull and release the layers of skin to enhance lymph flow and eliminate stagnant energy. This treatment is gentle, non-invasive, and simulates the rhythmic, fluid movements of a manual lymphatic drainage massage. - Lymphatic drainage can help improve the function of the nervous, muscular, lymphatic, and immune systems by promoting circulation and detoxification and reducing inflammation. Using gentle, rhythmical movements, our lymphatic drainage massages help to enhance fluid flow among the connective tissue while encouraging the lymphatic system to eliminate metabolic waste products, excess fluid, and bacteria. - The main difference between a therapeutic and relaxing massage is the goal of the massage. A therapeutic massage is primarily focused on addressing specific issues, such as pain management, range of motion, injury rehabilitation, or relieving muscle tension. This type of massage involves more targeted techniques that focus on specific areas of the body. Relaxing massages are designed to help you unwind and improve your overall sense of well-being. They typically involve gentle, flowing strokes and rhythmic movements to ease muscle tension and promote total relaxation. Unlike therapeutic massages, these massages are more general in nature and do not focus on treating specific conditions or injuries. Looking for massage therapy in Westport, Connecticut?
