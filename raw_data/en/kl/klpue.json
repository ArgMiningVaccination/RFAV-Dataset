Holistic Medicine Holistic medicine is not just eating healthy, it is an approach to the care of patients that any doctor, not just a natural medicine doctor might have.

In homeopathy, the dose of medicine is very small.

Homeopathy is used for acute and chronic conditions. It is safe for pets and babies and does not have any drug interactions.

CT Dr. Munro enabled me to find success in several areas of health, including the elimination of allergy symptoms, digestive issues, and depression. When I started with her, I was on four long-term medications, and despite the medications, I continued to have symptoms. Now, I am off all of those medications and symptom-free. Throughout the process, Dr. Munro gave me concrete steps to take, provided the rationale behind her suggestions, and explained how those steps might help me reach my long-term goals. She was realistic in acknowledging that the individual nature of natural remedies requires experimenting, adding things in and taking things out until we found the combination that worked for me. Dr. Munro was very empowering, giving me options and suggestions based on my particular situation, but encouraging me to be the final decision maker. She carefully considered suggestions I brought based on my own research, supplemented my suggestions with her own knowledge or words of caution as needed, and together we tried various options and ultimately found what worked best. In addition to her naturopathic expertise, Dr. Munro is a wonderful person. She is warm and supportive, eager to understand and connect, and is a joy to work with. My husband was my partner in my year-long journey to good health; he attended all my sessions with Dr. Munro, and she encouraged him to be an integral part of the process. I recommend Dr. Munro to anyone considering natural alternatives as a means of achieving better health. Her knowledge, empowerment, and support helped me get off all long-term medications while simultaneously eliminating all symptoms\u2014a success story whose facts make the strongest recommendation of all.
