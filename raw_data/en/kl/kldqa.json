Often, that involvement leads both patients and physicians to apply holistic approaches, complementary therapies, and alternative medicines. At the University of Minnesota, the [Center for Spirituality and Healing](http://www.csh.umn.edu/) is [partnered with the Life Science Foundation](http://www.takingcharge.csh.umn.edu/) to provide accurate information and empower the individual to make these choices regarding their health. The University of Minnesota has a long tradition of approaching medicine from multiple vantage points. In 1888, the University established the [College of Homeopathic Medicine and Surgery](http://www.homeoint.org/history/king/3-07.htm) within the Department of Medicine. The new College of Homeopathic Medicine had been in fact the former prestigious Minnesota Homeopathic Medical College. The Medical College transferred its charter to the University in order to avoid competing with the newly formed Department of Medicine as well as to gain more prominence by being associated with the University. The measure also gained additional support for the University from the public who increasingly viewed homeopathic medicine as a preferred option to orthodox treatment methods. By the turn of the century, the College had grown to fifteen faculty members. However, over the next decade student numbers declined. In 1909 the College of Homeopathic Medicine merged with the College of Medicine and Surgery and by 1911, the Board of Regents removed the final two chairs associated with homeopathic studies within the College of Medicine and Surgery and ceased offering a separate diploma.
