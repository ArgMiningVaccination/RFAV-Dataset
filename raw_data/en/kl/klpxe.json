Physical therapists work with people who have been injured or people who are ill to improve their movement and help them manage their pain. The [U.S. Department of Labor](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/physical-therapists.htm#tab-2) explains that physical therapists \"are often an important part of rehabilitation, treatment, and prevention of patients with chronic conditions, illnesses, or injuries.\" Physical therapists can also choose to specialize in one of nine areas. According to the American Board of Physical Therapy Specialties, these areas of specialization are: - Cardiovascular and Pulmonary - Clinical Electrophysiology - Geriatrics - Neurology - Oncology - Orthopaedics - Pediatrics - Sports and - Women's Health The national average cost for a physical therapist is [$60 to $80](https://www.thumbtack.com/p/physical-therapy-cost), although it will cost more if the patient is paying for services out of pocket rather than through insurance. If you have insurance and want to work with a physical therapist for a specialty area, such as oncology or geriatrics, you may need a referral from your general practitioner. Patients who are paying directly for services can often contact the physical therapist directly. What exactly does a physical therapist do? A physical therapist is a health care provider who assists patients with mobility improvement and pain management. Often patients are referred to a physical therapist by a primary care doctor or specialist for help recovering from a surgery or traumatic injury, such as a car crash. Physical therapists help patients manage pain that results from chronic disease and other illness. Physical therapy can help enhance mobility when patients are faced with neurological disorders, such as after a stroke, and provide relief from arthritis or other mobility and pain issues. A physical therapist uses medical exercise equipment and exercises to empower patients to regain flexibility and mobility where possible. They may use treadmills, steps, medicine balls, resistance bands, isometric exercises, weights and more to improve muscle control and movement. A physical therapist uses physical movement to help heal the patient, but also can sometimes prescribe medication as appropriate. A physical therapist can also become board certified in one of nine specialty areas. Why is physical therapy important? Physical therapy can help you recover range of motion and ease pain after injury, accident or illness. Many people are prescribed physical therapy by their primary care doctor or specialist after a car accident, surgery or sports-related injury. You don't need a doctor's referral to start physical therapy, but unless you are paying out of pocket for the services, your insurance provider might require a referral. Physical therapy is also a medical solution for pain associated with chronic illness such as osteoarthritis and can be used for recovery after a stroke or other neurological disorders. Physical therapy teaches you how to move your body in a safe and healing way to regain strength and movement. During a physical therapy session, the PT will teach you to use medical exercise equipment and approved exercises to regain your lost flexibility and improve your mobility where possible. You may use treadmills, steps, medicine balls, resistance bands, isometric exercises, weights and more. From young children to seniors, patients of any age can benefit from the science-based movements and exercises that encourage flexibility, rebuild muscle, and ease stiff joints.

A longer massage allows the massage therapist to give you an all-over massage and then circle back to focus on areas in need of extra bodywork.

The techniques are called effleurage, friction, petrissage, tapotement and vibration.

What is a deep tissue full body massage? A deep tissue full body massage is a form of healing bodywork. At your first massage, your massage therapist will do a brief intake. They will ask you questions about the type of pressure you'd like to receive during your deep tissue massage, any previous massage experience you've had, and any injuries or sensitivities you have. You can remain clothed, or the massage therapist will provide draping so that even if you're not wearing clothes you are always fully covered. Deep tissue massage may be a good option for people with chronic pain or muscle tension. The systematic deep tissue strokes will work to break down any scar tissue or stiff tissues and create ease in your body again.

If you have an old sports injury such as shin splints, or a bad back from an old car accident, deep tissue massage can promote healing in your traumatized and scarred soft tissues and get you on the road to recovery. The strokes and techniques used in deep tissue massage work to lengthen soft tissue structures that have stiffened and hardened into knotty adhesions that allow minimal movement.
