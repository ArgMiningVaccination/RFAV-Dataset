Your statement should explain your religious belief, establish that it is sincerely held, and explain in what ways receiving the COVID -19 vaccination conflicts with your religious belief. Sample vaccine exemption language [Introduction] Taking the Covid vaccine would violate my sincerely held Christian beliefs. I have a sincerely held r eligious objection to the Covid vaccine and I am respectfully asserting my right to a religious exemption from this vac cine mandate. [I am a Christian and active in my Church. My Christian faith teaches that life begins at the moment of conception. All life is a gift from God in all of its stages and is sacred. This is true for all human beings. Jeremiah 1:5, Psalm 139:13-18, Exodus 20:13, Job 31:15, Proverbs 6:16 -19.] [I have been a devout Christian for several years and believe strongly in the Holy Bible. I read passages daily and have strong convictions. I have been baptized into my faith which proves my sincerity. My belief and personal understanding of God's message to me prevents me from receiving this vaccine. ] [Covid -19 vaccines link to abortion] Due to my sincerely held religious beliefs, the pro -life cause has been an issue near and dear to my heart. I have and continue to support the pro -life cause. However over the past year, I was distressed to learn that all three COVID -19 vaccinations were associated and linked with abortion, through the use of aborted fetal cells. My sincerely held religious beliefs call me to be staunchly pro -life and to oppose the use of and market for aborted fetal cells. My faith dictates that elective abortion is wr ong because it is the intentional killing of human life. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses the PerC6 aborted fetal cell line to develop its vaccine. PerC6 cells were derived from an 18 -week-old fetus who was electively aborted. The Modera and Pfizer us e the HEK293 aborted cell line in the confirmation phase, a cell line derived from elective abortion as well. My faith directs me to oppose abortion and the use of, the experimentation with, or the benefiting from aborted fetal tissue. For these reasons, I cannot agree to take the COVID -19 vaccine, or any vaccine connected to or that used abortion -derived fetal cells at any stage in the vaccine's development because doing so violates my sincere ly held religious beliefs. /////// [The Bible teaches that my body is a temple and that I am not to defile it ] I have been a devout Christian for several years and believe strongly in the Holy Bible. I read passages daily and have strong convictions. I have been baptized into my faith which proves my sincerity. My belief and personal understanding of God's message to me prevents me from receiving this vaccine. To abide in faith, I refrain from altering my body in ways that are against my deeply biblical and sincere beliefs. First and foremost, God's word to me says that my body is a temple of the Holy Spirit and I am required to protect it from injections (which are unclean). 1 Corinthians 3:16 -17: \"Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in your midst? If anyone destroys Go d's temple, God will destroy that person; for God's temple is sacred, and you together are that temple.\" 1 Corinthians 6:19: \"Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own.\" I won't consume things that I believe will defile my body or conscience as I am instructed in 1 Corinthians 8:7: \"Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge; for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.\" 2 Corinthians 7:1: \"There is admonition against defiling the flesh and the spirit.\" I believe that this vaccine would defile my body and conscience. I trust God. Isaiah 2:22: \"Stop trusting in mere human s, who have but a breath in their nostrils. Why hold them in esteem?\" My sincere religious belief requires me not to take something into my body unless it complies with God's law, which I sincerely believe this vaccine does not. Mark 12:17: \"Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's.\" [Conclusion] I must worship Him and obey His word (specifically the words above) and He will protect me. I cannot betray my faith. Proverbs 30:5: \"Every word of God is pure. He is a shield unto them that put their trust in in Him.\" I must follow whatever his path and directive is to me, which is to not receive this vaccine. I trust His guidance to me which I receive in conversations through prayer with Him. Psalms 32:8: \"I will ins truct thee and teach thee in the way thou shalt go; I will guide thee with mine eye.\" Ultimately, my sincere faith and relationship with God prohibits me from receiving the Covid vaccine and I'm firm in my religious objection. Respectfully, ///// Here is another sample: I am requesting a Religious Exemption from required immunizations I am a non -denominational Christian. I sincerely believe that the Old and New Testament Scriptures are inspired by God and serve as the supreme and final authority f or my faith and life. I am not governed by any organized religious group or leader. I came to my faith and belief in Christ several years ago. In 2019, I took a gap year to reflect on and study my faith further and attended a Bible school in New York whe re I rededicated myself to Christ. I study the Bible and pray daily. I am an active member of my church. I strive to live ethnically and to exemplify love, kindness, peace, and honesty. I exercise regularly, eat simply, and refrain from behavior and prac tices that conflict with Biblical principles, including the use of alcohol, smoking, and the intake of morally objectionable substances. I respectfully request a religious exemption from the COVID -19 vaccines because, among other reasons, each contains ingredients which are morally objectionable to me as a Christian. In addition, I understand that fetal cell lines were key to producing the COVID -19 vaccines, and I believe it is unethical to use materials derived in this way. Both Pfizer and Moderna used the fetal cell line HEK 293 in their confirmation phase to ensure that the vaccines worked. Those cells were taken from aborted fetal tissue. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine similarly used PER.C6 fetal cell line cells which were taken from aborted fetal tiss ue. While some persons of faith point out that these historic cell lines did not require new abortions, I am concerned that vaccine manufacturers' dependence on the abortion industry is ongoing. Due to the diminishing supply and shelf -life of current fetal cell lines, research into new fetal cell lines, such as the WALVAX -2, is underway to meet the demands of mass vaccination. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/ articles/PMC4526020/ As a Christian, I cannot justify participating in such a system and injecting myself with objectionable ingredients in order to avoid COVID -19, which I believe will pose little to no danger to me personally. The Bible is clear about the sanctity of fetal life (Psalm 139: 13 -16; Jeremiah 1:5), concerning the human body (1 Cor. 6:19 -20; 2 Cor. 7:1) and abstaining from immoral practices (1 Timothy 5:22; Ephesians 5:11). There are numerous Christian pastors (including my own), doctors, writers, and organizations who believe as I do that it is reasonable for Christians to b e skeptical of the U.S. vaccination program and to choose not to participate as a matter of faith and conscience. I certainly do not wish to be a harm or danger to others. In the event of an outbreak of COVID - 19 on campus, I would consider quarantining myself or returning home. "}
