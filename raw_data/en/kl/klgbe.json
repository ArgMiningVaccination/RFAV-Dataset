Learn about why you may be experiencing nerve pain below, and discover whether the DRS Protocol is the right treatment to help you finally experience true relief from your nerve pain. Understanding your nerve irritation You have 31 pairs of spinal nerves exiting your spinal cord through openings between your vertebrae. These branch out into many peripheral nerves that control different parts of your body. For example, a nerve that exits the lower back has peripheral branches that extend all the way down to your feet and toes. Nerves can become irritated and compressed where they exit your spine. When a nerve is impinged where it exits the spine, you may experience severe and sharp pain. The pain is sometimes described by patients as a feeling of electricity in the body. It is not uncommon to experience numbness, tingling, and weakness. These sensations often travel the path of the irritated nerve itself.
