[Stephen Montgomery](http://med.stanford.edu/profiles/Stephen_Montgomery/). Identifying the molecular causes of phenotypic diversity will be enhanced by our ability to decipher individual genomes. However, the complexity of life, our resolution and subsequent ability to define individual traits and the vast information encoded within each genome has made the direct translation of genotype to phenotype elusive. The Montgomery Lab aims to uncover and define how a specific class of genetic variation, namely those variants which effect the expression of genes, first impact cellular state and behavior and then ultimately play a role in defining human traits and disease.

From the [Prot\u00e9g\u00e9](https://protege.stanford.edu/)system for building such models (ontologies), to [BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/)for disseminating such ontologies, to [CEDAR](https://metadatacenter.org/)for enabling scientists to use ontologies to describe their experiments and their experimental data, my team is exploring the complete life cycle of computer-encoded biomedical knowledge. Our goal is to make online scientific data FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable). That ambitious objective will be achieved only when biomedical investigators can describe their experiments in a machine-processable manner with the same scope and precision that we associate with prose journal articles. CEDAR provides the basis for much of this work to enhance scientific communication. Collaborations with a large group of colleagues provide opportunities to evaluate our ideas in practice.

We lead the Stanford Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease, one of the few medical centers in the country where patient genome sequences can be readily incorporated into clinical care. In 2010, we led the team of BMI faculty that completed the first clinical interpretation of a human genome. We extended this to a pipeline that would handle families in 2011. We are also fascinated by network biology. Part of the Stanford heart transplant team, we are focused on understanding the heart's response to disease or exercise stress. We are part of a team of three major transplant centers that was recently awarded $9m to explore the genetic control of cardiac transcriptional activity via RNA sequencing and network modeling. Finally, although many of our questions can be answered in silico, to establish causality, we turn to the wet lab to explore the biology of key genes and signaling modules.

Chen](http://web.stanford.edu/~jonc101/). In the face of ever escalating complexity in medicine, integrating informatics solutions is the only credible approach to systematically address challenges in healthcare. Tapping into real-world clinical data streams like electronic medical records with machine learning and data analytics will reveal the community's latent knowledge in a reproducible form. Delivering this back to clinicians, patients, and healthcare systems as clinical decision support will uniquely close the loop on a continuously learning health system.

Deep Learning in medical imaging (diagnosis, prediction) and clinical imaging outcomes prediction, clinical decision support, imaging utilization and appropriateness, cohort feature engineering with structured and unstructured EMR data for modeling applications [Parag Mallick](http://med.stanford.edu/profiles/Parag_Mallick/). Research in the Mallick lab centers on developing and applying multi-scale systems approaches to enable personalized, predictive medicine in cancer. Specifically, we are developing computational methods and experimental techniques to identify diagnostic and prognostic circulating biomarkers. Biomarker-based approaches to detect cancers as early as possible and to personalize treatment are envisioned to radically improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Within our multi-scale framework, one can consider biomarkers to be host-scale variables that inform tumor and cell-scale phenomena. Our approach to marker discovery begins with the development of molecular/cellular-scale models that attempt to describe how cells are likely to behave in response to endogenous (mutation) or exogenous perturbation (therapeutics). At the tumor-scale, we are investigating tumor heterogeneity and evolution. Recently, we have been interrogating the role of tumor-microenvironment in directing tumor evolution. At the host-scale, we are attempting to model the relationship between the tumor and the circulating proteomes to help inform biomarker candidate selection. Together, these inquiries will enable us to better understand cancer and to enable rational, model-driven approaches to biomarker discovery.

[Richard Olshen](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/richard-olshen). Dr. Olshen's interests regarding research are in statistics and mathematics and their applications to medicine and biology. Many efforts have concerned binary tree-structured algorithms for classification, regression, survival analysis, and clustering. Those for classification and survival analysis have been used with success in computer-aided diagnosis and prognosis, especially in cardiology, oncology, and toxicology. With the late Leo Breiman, Jerome Friedman (of Stanford), and Charles Stone (of the University of California, Berkeley) he coauthored the book Classification and Regression Trees, that gives motivation, algorithms, various examples, and mathematical theory for what have come to be known as CART algorithms. The approaches to tree-structured clustering have been applied to lossy data compression, especially in digital radiography (with Robert Gray of the Department of Electrical Engineering at Stanford and others), and also to HIV genetics. Recent research concerns applying information on SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and other features as together they predispose to hypertension in a population of white women. Much of his work concerns analyses of longitudinal data. Some that was of interest concerned the pharmacokinetics of intracavitary chemotherapy with systemic rescue. Related efforts have also been to the development of mature walking, longitudinal studies of cholesterol, and many aspects of glomerular filtration in patients with nephrotic disorders.

My research interests include analysis of high throughput biological data, for instance finding age-related genes in multiple species and tissues with the Kim lab. I am generally interested in settings where both rows and columns of the data matrix correspond to entities of interest, that is, neither are IID. Special interests include adjusting for the effects of latent variables, finding ways to bootstrap and cross-validate non-IID data, and making extensions to three-way and higher order data arrays. I also work on Monte Carlo methods. [Douglas K. Owens](http://med.stanford.edu/profiles/Douglas_Owens/). Research concerns health policy, clinical policy, and the development of analytic methods for evaluating policy questions. Particular interest in technology assessment and the application of decision theory to clinical/health policy problems. Special interest in questions related to disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease. [Julia Palacios](https://profiles.stanford.edu/julia-palacios). I seek to provide statistically rigorous answers to concrete, data driven questions in evolutionary genetics. My research involves probabilistic modeling of evolutionary forces and the development of computationally tractable methods that are applicable to big data problems. Past and current research relies heavily on the theory of stochastic processes, Bayesian nonparametrics and recent developments in machine learning and statistical theory. [Vijay Pande.](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/vijay-pande)My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, Bayesian statistics, atomistic simulation, bioinformatics, and cheminformatics methods and its application to problems of linking drug efficacy and side effects to geneomics and systems biology. My group also has expertise in related synergistic areas, such as theoretical physical chemistry, structural biology, computer science, and large-scale distributed computing. By combining our methods with the Folding@home distributed computing project (currently the most powerful supercomputer in the world, with almost 10 petaflops of performace), we have a unique opportunity to push the state of the art in these and related areas. Finally, via collaborations with biotechs, pharmaceutical companies, and experimental groups interested in drug design, we can directly test our predictions, thus strengthening our methods as well as the direct impact of our results. [Dmitri Petrov](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/dmitri-petrov). Three main topics are studied in the lab: 1) mutation and evolution of global genomic properties, 2) evolution and population dynamic of transposable elements in eukaryotes, and 3) evolution and population dynamic of transposable elements in eukaryotes. [Russell Poldrack.](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/russell-poldrack)My lab's research uses neuroimaging to understand how neural systems give rise to complex cognitive functions and how these systems break down in neuropsychiatric disorders. We use machine learning techniques to decode behavior from neuroimaging data and to characterize the multidimensional structure of neural representations. We are also heavily involved in the development of neuroinformatics tools, including ontologies of mental function (through the Cognitive Atlas project), data sharing (through the OpenFMRI and Neurovault projects), and automated meta-analysis (through the Neurosynth project). [Jonathan Pritchard](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/jonathan-pritchard). Our group uses statistical and computational methods to study questions in genomics and evolutionary biology.

[David Rehkopf](https://profiles.stanford.edu/david-rehkopf). My research is focused on understanding the health implications of the myriad decisions that are made by corporations and governments every day -- decisions that profoundly shape the social and economic worlds in which we live and work. I analyze population based datasets to demonstrate the health implications of economic and social factors that can give the public and policy makers evidence to support new strategies for promoting health and well-being. In all of his work, I focus on the implications of these exposures for health inequalities. Since often policy and programmatic changes can take decades to influence health, my research also includes more basic research in understanding biological signals that may act as early warning signs of systemic disease, in particular accelerated aging. I examine how social and economic policy changes influence a range of early markers of disease and aging, with a particular recent focus on DNA methylation. [Johannes Reiter](https://profiles.stanford.edu/johannes-reiter). Our research in the Translational Cancer Evolution Laboratory focuses on the stochastic biological processes underlying cancer evolution with the goal to improve the prognosis and treatment of tumors. We develop computational methods to learn from large-scale biological data sets and design mathematical models to predict patient outcomes, generate novel hypotheses, and explain observations on a mechanistic level. We apply these methods to genomic data from clinically-annotated patient cohorts to advance precision medicine. For example, we have designed methods to optimize cancer early detection strategies and to find optimal combination therapies to minimize the risk of cancer relapse. [Manuel Rivas.](https://profiles.stanford.edu/manuel-rivas)The Rivas lab is based in the Department of Biomedical Data Science.

Such integrative methods may be applied to create comprehensive multi-scale representations of biomedical processes and pathological conditions, thus enabling their in-depth characterization. The radiology-pathology fusion allows the creation of rich spatial labels that can be used as input for advanced machine learning to predict the presence and aggressiveness of cancers. [Manish Saggar.](http://bdl.stanford.edu/)We are a computational neuropsychiatry lab, dedicated to developing methods for a better understanding of individual differences in brain functioning in healthy and psychiatric populations. We primarily work with noninvasive human neuroimaging data (fMRI, EEG, and fNIRS). We are currently working in these three areas - [a] Modeling spatiotemporal dynamics in brain activity to develop person- and disorder-centric biomarkers; [b] Understanding the role of brain dynamics for optimized learning and performance (e.g., creativity) in individual and team settings; and [c] Developing methods that use network science, machine learning, and signal processing for better understanding of brain dynamics. [Julia Salzman.](http://med.stanford.edu/profiles/Julia_Salzman/)Our goal is to use experimental and statistical tools to construct a high dimensional picture of gene regulation, including cis and trans control of the full repertoire of RNAs expressed by cells. Currently, we are focusing on the function and biogenesis of circular RNA, which we recently discovered to be a ubiquitous and uncharacterized component of eukaryotic gene expression. A second major goal is to study gene expression variation in human cancer. Here, we combine mining massive public datasets, and experimental study of primary tumors and cell lines with bioinformatic and statistical methods. We use the cancer genome as window into functional roles played by RNA, and are attempting to characterize potential biomarkers. [Molly Schumer.](https://schumerlab.com/)Hybridization between species is a common process in the evolutionary history of many species, including our own. Despite this, the evolutionary consequences of hybridization are still relatively poorly understood. We focus on using genomic, computational and experimental approaches to understand how hybridization shapes the evolution of genomes and species. Current projects in the lab include developing new approaches to detect selection after hybridization, time-transect monitoring of hybrid genome evolution, and understanding the genetic architecture of hybrid incompatibilities. [Gavin Sherlock](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/gavin-sherlock). The Sherlock lab uses genomic approaches to shed light on biological systems, particularly employing high throughput sequencing and rigorous analyses of the resulting data. We are characterizing adaptive evolution at the molecular level to understand the adaptive landscape that yeast populations traverse when evolving under a selective pressure. Specifically, we want to know what are the mutational and fitness trajectories taken as a population explores the landscape. We have sequenced the genomes of many adaptive clones and identified the genes and pathways that are the targets of adaptive mutation under a particular selective pressure. We are currently sequencing DNA from entire populations, developing rigorous statistical models to identify low frequency mutations and distinguish them from sequence errors. In a second project, we are using high throughput sequencing to sequence the transcriptome of the in many ways, different alleles of the same gene can be thought of a paralogs, as they never go through a haploid phase where deleterious alleles would be exposed. This should result in a relaxed evolutionary constraint, and possible lead to allele specific transcription. We are focusing our efforts on understanding the RNA sequencing data to look for allele specific events, which requires significant bioinformatics expertise. We have recently phased SNPs in the diploid genome, which gives us greater power to detect such events. Finally, we are also looking at changes that occur in cancer. We have profiled DNA methylation changes in prostate cancer, and found that there are large scale genome wide difference between normal and tumor prostate tissue. We are currently working to understand the origins of these changes. [Hua Tang.](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/hua-tang)Genetic variation does not only underlie phenotypic diversity among individuals, but also documents the evolutionary history of a species. Research in our laboratory aims to uncover the evolutionary forces that have shaped the patterns of genetic variation in humans, to elucidate the genetics basis of complex traits, and to shed light on the mechanisms that lead to diverse phenotypes and disparate disease risk among populations. We approach these questions by developing statistical and computational approaches, by analyzing large-scale genomic data, and by collaborating with experts in a variety of fields. [Terry Winograd](http://hci.stanford.edu/winograd/). Research is on human-computer interaction design, with a focus on the theoretical background and conceptual models. He directs the teaching programs and HCI research in the Stanford Human-Computer Interaction Group. He is also a founding faculty member of the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford (the \"d.school\") and on the faculty of the Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law (CDDRL) [John Witte](https://med.stanford.edu/wittelab.html). The Witte Lab is a computational and epidemiological research group investigating the genetic and environmental contributions to disease risk and progression. We develop and apply novel genetic epidemiological methods to decipher the mechanisms underlying complex diseases. Current areas of research include the following: 1) Evaluating disease risk with novel approaches to polygenic risk scores and hierarchical models; 2) Assessing the shared genetic basis across different diseases and traits (pleiotropy); and 3) Finding genetic risk factors, improving screening, and reducing disparities in cancer. [Wing Hung Wong](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/wing%20wong?tab=research-and-scholarship). Current interest centers on the application of statistics to problems arsing from biology.

[James Zou](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/james-zou). We develop a wide range of machine learning algorithms and are especially interested in extracting disease insights from population genomics and epigenomics. On the methodology side, we are investigating new approaches to adaptive data analysis, representation learning for bio-medical data, new probabilistic models that encourage diversity, and multi-view learning. Application topics include: whole-genome and exome sequence analysis, risk prediction, synthetic biology, chromatin dynamics and transcription regulation. [Michael Bassik.](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/michael-bassik)We study how endocytic pathogens such as bacterial toxins, viruses, and protein aggregates enter the cell, disrupt homeostasis, and cause apoptosis. More broadly, we would like to understand how diverse stresses induced by biological, chemical, and therapeutic agents signal to the cell death machinery. To do this, we use basic cell biology and biochemistry, as well as novel ultra-complex shRNA libraries we have developed, which have allowed the first systematic genetic interaction maps in mammalian cells. A complementary interest is the development of technologies for screening and measuring genetic interactions, with the ultimate goal of finding synergistic drug targets for endocytic pathogens and other diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's. [Catherine Blish](http://med.stanford.edu/profiles/Catherine_Blish/). The Blish lab is focused on using a systems immunology approach to develop new methods to prevent and control infectious diseases. Our studies are highly translational in nature, bringing comprehensive immune profiling techniques such as mass cytometry to clinical and epidemiologic studies of HIV transmission and influenza vaccination. We are particularly interested in the role of NK cells in viral immunity, the etiology behind the susceptibility of pregnant women to viruses, and the impact of viral diversity and escape in the interplay between the virus and the host immune response. [Anne Brunet](https://web.stanford.edu/group/brunet/lab%20members.html). My laboratory is interested in aging and rejuvenation. To tackle the complexity of aging, we use high throughput approaches in model organisms with diverse lifespans - worms, killifish, and mice. We work to identify the genetics and epigenetic mechanisms underlying the aging clock and the pathways involved in modulating this aging clock in response to external stimuli, including diet. We are particularly excited to determine the mechanisms of brain aging and rejuvenation, focusing on the role of regenerative neural stem cells during aging. Finally, we have pioneered the short-lived African killifish as a new vertebrate model for aging and 'suspended animation' and are excited to use this scalable organismal model to uncover new genes and compounds that counter aging and age-related diseases. [Emma Brunskill](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/ebrun/). My goal is to create AI systems that learn from few samples to robustly make good decisions. This is a crucial part of human intelligence that enables people to adapt and even thrive in changing environments. While scientific knowledge can help guide interventions, there remains a key need to quickly cut through the space of decision policies to find effective strategies to support people. Reinforcement learning (RL), the subfield of artificial intelligence focused on agents that learn through experience to make high utility choices, is a powerful framework for addressing these challenges. However, most recent efforts in RL have focused on settings where good or perfect simulators exist, and it is cheap and feasible to collect millions of trials. In contrast, my work focuses on the many societal applications - treating patients with advanced liver cancer or training people to be computer technicians - which both lack good simulators and are inherently data limited. I create new reinforcement learning algorithms and conduct theoretical analysis to understand what is possible, all inspired and motivated by my applications in education and healthcare. [Eugene Butcher](http://med.stanford.edu/butcherlab.html). Research interests include: single cell omits at the interface with immune, vascular and tumor biology; and algorithm development and validation. [Stanley N. Cohen](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/stanley-cohen). The collection and interpretation of large amounts of data obtained from DNA and protein microarrays has become an important approach toward understanding the biological regulatory circuits that control gene expression. In the prevailing paradigm, clusters of genes that show common patterns of expression on microarrays are identified computationally and relationships among these genes are inferred by the experimenter in part by using his/her prior knowledge. [Ronald Davis](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/ronald-davis). Our lab is using Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Human to conduct whole genome analysis projects. The yeast genome sequence has approximately 6,000 genes. We have made a set of haploid and diploid strains (21,000) containing a complete deletion of each gene. In order to facilitate whole genome analysis each deletion is molecularly tagged with a unique 20-mer DNA sequence. This sequence acts as a molecular bar code and makes it easy to identify the presence of each deletion. [Elizabeth Egan](https://profiles.stanford.edu/elizabeth-egan). The Egan lab uses a variety of molecular and genetic approaches to understand host-pathogen interactions in malaria infections. We are particularly interested in uncovering the role of human erythrocyte factors in malaria infection, in studies which range from genetic association studies, to transcriptomic studies, to complex forward genetic screens. Since erythrocytes are enucleated and lack DNA, many of our projects rely on the use of red cells generated ex-vivo from primary human hematopoietic stem cells that are manipulated using genome editing. Using these approaches, we are investigating a variety of topics including the role of host cell signaling in malaria parasite invasion, natural genetic variation driving malaria susceptibility, and host cell responses to malaria infection of human bone marrow.

[Hanlee Ji.](http://med.stanford.edu/profiles/Hanlee_Ji/)Research group is focused on the genomic analysis of cancer with several general goals. 1) Developing novel, cost-effective genomic technologies involving next generation DNA sequencing for application in cancer mutation characterization and genomic biomarker discovery. My group is focused on integrating genomic analysis with clinical issues in oncology and integration into oncology clinical trials. 2) Developing computational analytical methods for next generation sequencing and application in genomic diagnostic technologies. 3) Applying functional comparative genomic approaches to identify genes involved in genomic instability in colorectal carcinoma and understanding these genes role in biological networks [Paul Khavari.](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/paul-khavari)The Khavari Lab uses epithelial tissue as a model system to study stem cell biology, cancer and new molecular therapeutics. Epithelia cover external and internal body surfaces and undergo constant self-renewal while responding to diverse environmental stimuli. Epithelial homeostasis precisely balances stem cell-sustained proliferation and differentiation-associated cell death, a balance which is lost in many human diseases, including cancer. [Karla Kirkegaard](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/karla-kirkegaard). Lab investigates the cell biology, genetics and biochemistry of RNA viral propagation, using poliovirus as a model system. For many subcellular viruses and parasites, RNA, not DNA, is the carrier of genetic information. Poliovirus serves as a model to increase our understanding of positive-strand RNA viruses for which no vaccine is available and which remain a significant health hazard: examples include other picornaviruses, such as rhinoviruses, coxsackieviruses and the deadly enterovirus 71, as well as more distantly related positive-strand RNA viruses such as hepatitis C and Dengue fever.

[Lianne Kurina](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/lianne-kurina). Our research program is focused on the physical and mental health of active-duty U.S. Army soldiers. We have developed the Stanford Military Data Repository (SMDR) in collaboration with colleagues at the Army's Office of the Surgeon General to enable large-scale cohort studies addressing disability, heat injury, musculoskeletal injuries, pregnancy outcomes, and behavioral health outcomes among soldiers. [Michael Levitt](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/michael-levitt). Research asks if it is possible to understand the molecular structure and function of proteins and nucleic acids in enough detail to make accurate predictions about structure and function. We are mounting a two-pronged attack on this problem using both molecular dynamics simulation and molecular modeling. [Jin Billy Li.](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/profiles/jin-li)The landscape of RNA editing in the transcriptomes The main interest of Jin Billy Li's lab is to identify and interpret the RNA editing sites using a variety of approaches including genomics, technology development, and computational biology. RNA editing is a phenomenon where genomically encoded information is changed in the RNA. Adenosine-to-Inosine (A-to-I) editing is the most common type of editing, and is achieved by enzymes called Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR). RNA editing is critical because ADAR knockout mice die before or shortly after birth. Despite the fact that RNA editing was first discovered over twenty years ago, it has been surprisingly under appreciated and under explored. Very few RNA editing sites had been discovered in humans, mainly due to technological barriers. We recently expanded the RNA \"editome\" to about 400 sites by computational prediction followed by targeted next generation sequencing (Li et al., Science 2009, 324:1210-1213). This, however, is probably just tip of the iceberg. Our lab will continue the discovery of the RNA editing sites in the transcriptomes of human and may model organisms, as well as various disorders such as autism and cancers. Our main approach is next generation sequencing and computational data analysis. Bioinformatics skills are also needed in a genome-wide association study to link genetic variations with the RNA editing level of a nearby editing site. In a longer term, we aim to perform functional genomic screening of these newly identified RNA editing sites. [Henry Lowe](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/profiles/henry-lowe). Primary research interests are in the areas of clinical and research information systems design, development and evaluation including multimedia clinical systems, integration of data to support patient care and clinical research, biomedical terminologies, automated indexing of biomedical documents, cancer information systems and biomedical data security. [Garry Nolan](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/garry-nolan). Dr. Nolan's laboratory focuses on the analysis of biological events at the single cell level using novel genetic and FACS-based approaches at the intersection of immunology, autoimmunity, biochemistry, and cancer. The laboratory studies phospho-protein immune cell and cancer signaling, and other metabolic parameters by analysis of biochemical functions at the single cell level in primary cell populations. This includes interrogation of cancer (Cell, 2004) and immune signaling networks in complex cell populations (Science, 2005), drug screening approaches (Nature Methods, 2005, (cover article), Nature Chemistry and Biology, 2007a, Nature Chemistry and Biology, 2007b (cover article)) and using multiparameter data to stratify signaling maps from patient samples, (Cancer Cell, 2008, cover article). Other major interest areas of the laboratory include mapping of signaling networks within complex populations of immune cells, developing systems biology approaches to develop an atlas of immune cell differentiation (Nature Biotechnology, In Press, 2011), the development of mechanism-based diagnostics for use in clinical trial studies. The data generated at the single cell level ranges from 10-15 parameters per cell (hundreds of thousands of cells per sample, and dozens of samples per experiment) to up to 50-100 parameters per cell using a new mass spectrometer flow cytometer we have co-developing and recently published upon (Bendall et al, Science, 2011). To analyze these datasets and infer signaling networks within each cell subpopulation, we have developed novel hardware (Field Programmable Gate Arrays and GPUs tethered to standard CPUs with novel compiler/distributor architecture) to implement the more computationally intensive algorithms we are using for our Bayesian inference and other bioinformatics approaches. The combination of hardware/software/biology applied in the laboratory to clinical samples sits at the edge of the translational arena in that we focus on developing techniques that can provide mechanistically relevant answers to clinicians while simultaneously helping biologist answer questions of basic importance to biology. [Natalie Pageler](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/natalie-pageler). In my administrative role as Associate Chief Medical Information Officer at Stanford Children's Health, I oversee the development and maintenance of clinical decision support tools within the electronic medical record. These clinical decision support tools are designed to enhance patient safety, efficiency, and quality of care. My research focuses on rigorously evaluating--1) how these tools affect clinician knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors; and 2) how these tools affect clinical outcomes and efficiency of health care delivery. As a pediatric intensivist, I have a specific interest in tools that facilitate improved situational awareness and information processing in the ICU as well as early warning systems that can detect clinical deterioration. [David Relman.](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/david-relman?tab=research-and-scholarship)Primary research focus is the human indigenous microbiota (microbiome), and in particular, the nature and mechanisms of variation in patterns of microbial diversity within the human body as a function of time (microbial succession), space (biogeography within the host landscape), and in response to perturbation, e.g., antibiotics (community robustness and resilience). One of the goals of this work is to define the role of the human microbiome in health and disease. We are particularly interested in measuring and understanding resilience in the human microbial ecosystem.
