Also, in Vedic tradition, the early Indians who developed yoga, meditation, and Ayurveda called the concoction Soma and believed it helped achieve enlightenment. The history of [Ayurveda](http://everydayayurveda.org/an-introduction-to-ayurveda) is said to have originated in India some 5000 years ago. Ayureda developed when there was an urgency to manage some psychological, physical and spiritual health afflictions. History states that the enlightened beings (Sattvic) went up into the Himalayas, meditated and brought forth from the 'source' this science of life. Ayurveda which means the 'Science of life', illuminates, incorporates and has a direct relationship with all the healing practices from around the globe. As such, they can all find a home under the Ayurvedic umbrella. Whether it be Chinese Acupuncture that uses 'meridians'( which Ayurveda refers to as 'Nadis') or Massage which Ayurveda calls 'Abhyanga'. The concept of the Ayurvedic system states that through the implementation of dietary and daily practices we can enable the body to remove Toxins ( [AMA](http://everydayayurveda.org/agni-ama)) and darkness (TAMAS) from our mind, body and spirit. This removal helps us reach a state of harmony and balance called 'Sattvic'. This is the key, if we understand the basis of what 'SATTVIC' means, becoming more aligned with mind, body and spirit. This allows us to become more heart orientated so we can tap into the 'collective consciousness' (C G JUNG) or 'Godhead/Atman'. With this said, it does take years to be able to create and cultivate such an inner stillness that facilitates the opening of our 'third eye' thus tapping into your own innate psychic abilities; which is an innate ability for all humans. Think with the heart this is where it starts. The guru is you, teachers are merely inner seekers. Learn the verse of your inner universe. - Siddha Somanomah MEMBER CONTENT: Related Everyday Practices The indigenous medicine Ayahuasca is found in most of Northern South America. This medicine has been used for '1000's' of years. Ayahuasca has been associated with the healing of cancerous growths and severe mental conditions. This is done alongside the implementation and administration of different Amazonian plants. The brew itself is the marriage of two plants the Ayahuasca vine (Banisteriopsis Caapi). The vine is an MAO inhibitor used along with the plant 'Chacruna' (Psychotria Viridis). Chacruna contains this psychoactive ingredient 'DMT. Our bodies cannot process this DMT without the MAOI's found in the Ayahuasca vine (This practice has a wide array of beliefs and rituals associated with shamanic healing, trying to explain them all here holds little relevance to what I am trying to describe). Our pineal gland naturally produces the substance (DMT). The pineal gland is associated with our 'third eye' chakra and is also referred to as 'the seat of the soul'. Ayahuasca, known as the 'vine of souls', when used in a sacred ceremonial context, can give us the ability to tap into the realm that I believe the 'Yogis' of ancient India were opening up through extended periods of meditation and dietary restrictions. Many people have more capability of activating their third eye/pineal glands, though some people may need a little more 'flick' of the 'switch' so to speak. With respect to India and its account of sacramental medicines, there is a long lost medicine called 'SOMA'. SOMA is associated with what I have perceived under the influence of Ayahuasca. From my speculation this may be the 'Phalaris Arundinacea' species which is said to contain the highest traces of DMT in world. This can be found in northern India being brewed with the blue lotus, which also is a MAO-inhibitor. Both these two medicines begin with the sound 'Eye'. The primordial vowel of these two words 'Ay'-ahuasca and 'Ay'-urveda is also the resonance or 'tone' of the third eye or 'Ajna', effecting and opening up the cosmic body with its core functions are Intuition, connection with higher self and the ability to see without filters of the 'Mind'. In the past the 'Yogis/Rishis' meditated in secluded caves on the divine, reaching heightened states. The sacramental use of the Ayahuasca brew helps us to reach this state via the plant world while also connecting and reflecting us back to the 'Mother Earth'. Within the multidimensional visionary aspect Ayahuasca provides, there can be the desire to have a out of body experience. Nevertheless what would truly benefit the participant is to have an inner body experience. An experience which brings us back into the moment and union with the source. A moment without being distracted, perplexed or ungrounded. In Ayurveda there are three doshas, each made up of a combination of the 5 elements. My body type is predominantly VATA (air and space). Thus, even though the first few ceremonies were amazing, it did take me a long time to come back to grounding and integrating these new found states into traits, stages etc. This is where the Ayurvedic model/system identifies our inclination towards becoming 'airy' or 'ungrounded'. I feel Ayurveda clearly enables and facilitates us to have these experiences. It contributes to helping us move into this stage of being much quicker and gentler. As these experiences can aggravate the 'Doshas', if care is not taken in the process. It is helpful to be aware of your ' [Dosha](http://everydayayurveda.org/dosha)' prior to 'sitting'. This knowledge can help you understand what foods to eat and what aroma therapies to acquire. Knowing your dosha will help bring you back from this heightened state. Now let's take a look at how to get to this place of wisdom, while keeping our feet somewhat on the Mother Earth. In Ayurveda when the entire energetic body and physical body is in a state of homeostasis we produce a 'substance' called 'Ojas'. Ojas is our vital primordial essence that comes from ether or spirit. It is said to have the texture of ghee and the color of gold. Precious Ojas can be depleted by pretty much any health defeating factors, such as: For our bodies to create Ojas we must first rid our 'whole' bodies of mental, physical, energetic or spiritual 'Tamas' and 'Rajas'. This brings me to the three 'Gunas' which I will describe in short so not to lose you in Ayurvedic philosophy. The Gunas are the three states of the mind which arise from the ether called 'Prakruti'. These can be increased, or decreased, with our objective in life is to move into a 'Sattvic' state and away from our current state (Vikruti). Tamas - This first state is a state of darkness, inertia, inactivity and materiality. Tamas manifests from ignorance and deludes all beings from their spiritual truths. To reduce Tamas avoid: Tamasic foods include heavy meats, and foods that are spoiled, chemically treated, processed or refined. The accumulation of this Guna is clear to see in modern society. Simply go to your nearest fast food restaurant and observe the behavioral and traits of all people who partake in a Tamasic way of living. You just might see darkness in the form of attachments, fear and there need to acquire more thus the cycle of Maya (illusion) present. Rajas is a state of energy, action, change and movement. The nature of Rajas is of attraction, longing and attachment. Rajas strongly bind us to the fruits of our work. To reduce Rajas avoid: Rajasic foods include fried foods, spicy foods, and stimulants. People who have these are not necessarily drawn away from the 'source', but more inclined to be more ego driven and to acquire more in the form of knowledge experience and outside luxuries. A rajasic mind is said to be one that always asking questions and is always seeking. Lastly, the state of Sattva is a state of harmony, balance, joy and intelligence. Sattvic is the Guna that 'Yogis' move towards as it reduces Rajas and Tamas and thus makes liberation possible. To increase Sattva reduce both Rajas and Tamas: Sattvic foods include whole grains, legumes, fresh fruits and vegetables that grow above the ground. All of the yogic practices were developed to create Sattva in the mind and body. Thus, practicing yoga and leading a yogic lifestyle strongly cultivates Sattva. Now if we look at the 'diet' you need to undergo as to be able to really allow Ayahuasca to do her work, its made up of: This diet that is not to be confused with the word dieta. Dieta is the shamanic process of the ingestion of certain plants; to acquire healing/teachings from the plant world. Personally, I have done two with the tree Chuchuwausa, which I found to nourish and replenish the Shukra, Rasa, Rakta dhatus (The Seven body tissues). This strict diet consists of mostly vegetables and some but very small amounts of fish (white meat) - All of which are Sattvic in nature. With respect to eating vegetables (which both practices endorse), what I have truly found was that when we eat things that are close to the 'source' or 'primordial energy' we become more like 'light.' This may lead us into the next stage of evolution which has been termed homo-illuminous. Plants take their nourishment from the Sun. When we consume them we get this energy firsthand. On the other hand, if we eat an animal that eats the plant we are moving further away from the 'source'. Now look at where artificial or processed foods lie and you can clearly see most of us have moved further away from a Sattvic way of life and into a Tamasic de-evolution. When you adhere to this Ojas producing diet you are allowing your body to be open for healing. This cleansing diet will limit the need for the physical (vomiting or diarrhea) or emotional purge (which may manifest as yawning, crying or even laughter). All are a process of expelling 'Tamas'. So what we have in common here is the idea of expelling the physical energetic and spiritual body of darkness. But it's not just in ceremony, there is also another Ayurvedic practice to remove dissonance of our state of being. This other aspect of expulsion of 'Tamas' is done through the Ayurvedic process of Pancha Karma, which is almost exactly the process used by the Shipibo Conibo practitioners Curanderos / Curanderas. The Five (Pancha) Actions (Karma) are much alike the healing style of the Curanderos and Curanderas of Peru. It is not only the diet, but also these other techniques that play a major role in healing the mind body matrix. Once we have removed toxins (Ama) from our whole bodies we can begin to move into higher vibration. This is because the Rajas or Tamas have been eliminated and the 'Ojas' can now start to flourish. Please beware if you are 'Vata' doing this practice in the long term without adequate 'down time' (eating ground vegetables) in between will lead to 'Vata' aggravation. This aggravation can actually hinder your healing. The night ceremonies could lead to a tendency towards insomnia and aggravate 'Pitta' . Thus, adequate rest is recommended. If you are 'Kapha' these methods will have the most effect and benefit. An excess of 'Kapha' expresses itself as: I will leave you with a practice you can take with you. When, or if, you plan to undergo this process, I recommend that before you go, you adhere to a 'Dosha' (body type) pacifying diet. This will allow the 'purge' to be less intense as you would have already begun the process of removing toxins (AMA) from your system. In addition, please be aware that when you are partaking in the use of this medicine, you are not around or touch other people as your 'crown' is open and unsanitary entities drop in. What is used when you need protection is the use of Pasangas/Shamanic aromas. The way to use these is to meditate with them and put intention into them. Just before you go into or during ceremony rub the fragrance over your Crown and body. Another method in protecting yourself is the use of tobacco/mapacho. While you are in ceremony, speak a prayer of protection into the Mapacho and ask him for protection. Then when you are in a state where you are losing yourself/ becoming too open - light the Mapacho, take the smoke into your mouth, make a saliva ball and swallow three times, all the while asking the Mapacho spirit to protect you or to bring you back. In closing, leading a Sattvic lifestyle a few months prior to attending a 'Ceremony' will balance your body and mind and allow you to be stronger and more open to healing. Also give some 'heart influenced' thoughts prior to ceremony for a intention or question for the medicine/your higher self. You will be amazed at how profound the answers may be (but keep them relative to what will help you heal yourself first, before moving onto the 'bigger' questions). Ayahuasca drink has a powerful hallucinogenic effect and has been used in South Asian countries for several years for its medicinal properties. Several studies have been carried out to analyse the benefit of this drink. Based on the finding it has been concluded that sipping the drink may have both positive and negative impact on the health. Most of these studies are carried out in the lab and in a set environment, so a lot more research is needed to establish its effect on humans. For your safety, do not take Ayahuasca in any form without consulting your doctor. Ayahuasca and Ayurveda: Merging Two Ancient Spiritual Sciences It is said that you are only able to partake and sit in a medicine ceremony when Mother Ayahuasca calls you. If you are meant to take the medicine, you will. If you are not meant to take medicine, will will not, some hurdle will undoubetedly block you. Ayahausca is a sacred plant medicine gifted to humanity to aid us in our spiritual growth, self-discovery, and mental-physical healing. Plants are living embodiments of Subtypes) Vata is the bio-energy in Ayurveda formed from the air and ether elements, and can be correlated to the wind princple. Just as wind regulates movements on the earth, vata governs all movements in the mind-body. Vata controls the nervous system and all electrical impulses traveling through it. Prana or life-force is one of the subtypes of Vata. and Vyana. are activated on both a physiological and subtle level. "}
