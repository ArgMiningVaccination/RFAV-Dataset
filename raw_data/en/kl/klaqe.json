Chi An important concept in Chinese medicine is chi (also known as qi ). Chi is the vital life energy of the body and is considered essential for all life. The chi flows through the body following pathways called meridians. Meridians flow through the internal organs and are named after the organ which they flow through. Illness and imbalance occurs when the chi is blocked or becomes stagnant in any of these meridian channels. Therefore, the goal in Chinese medicine and herbology is to keep the chi flowing unobstructed in order to maintain optimum health. Deficient chi: General weakness and lethargy; pale face and tongue; lack of appetite; soft-spoken, breathing. Stagnant chi: Soft lumps; dark purplish tongue; rebellious chi (energy flowing in the wrong direction); wiry or tense pulse; anxiety and depression.

Yin & Yang-regulating Formulas The other important concept in Chinese medicine is yin and yang which stems from a basic Chinese concept of the interdependence and relationship of opposites. Much like hot cannot be understood without cold, yin cannot exist without its opposite yang, and vice versa. Together the two poles are complementary and form a whole, much like a battery cannot generate a charge without its positive and negative poles. In relation to health issues, yin deficiency means the body's organs do not have enough raw material to function; in yang deficiency, the body's organs don't react adequately when needed. In traditional Chinese medicine, the goal is to balance the yin and the yang. Imbalances disrupt energy flow and compromise optimum health. Chinese herbal combinations to balance the complementary forces of yin and yang. Deficient yin: Burning sensation in skin, palms and feet; night sweats, insomnia; dry skin, eyes, mouth; constant thirst with frequent urination; agitation.
