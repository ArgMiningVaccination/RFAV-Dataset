Part 2 describes service access and provision. It is intended that the results of this OHNA will inform the planning and implementing of appropriate services, and oral health improvement strategies targeted at those at specific risk, or in underserved population subgroups. Objectives: To identify and gather sources of e xisting and relevant data and information which support the needs assessment process To research and describe the oral health characteristics of the population and identify their needs To measure the capacity of existing service provision to meet need To identify potential gaps in service provision, or areas where further investigation/analysis may be needed Proposed output The proposed output from this OHNA is a reference document produced for individual Area Teams, with specific and tailored sections dev eloped for Local Authorities, where oral health priorities are aligned to other local issues. Proposed target audiences of the resource may include: PHE Centre Directors NHS England Directors of Commissioning NHS England Area Teams Health and wellbeing boards Directors of Public Health Consultants in Dental Public Health Consultants in Public Health (Oral Health Lead) Commissioners in local authorities Local oral health improvement and oral health promotion teams Clinical direct ors of salaried primary care dental services Local Dental Professional Networks / Local Professional Network Chair Local dental committees Clinical commissioning groups Health and Justice Lead Healthwatch Patients and Public Involvement Forum 4 Community and voluntary groups The next stage The results of the OHNA will support the development of needs based recommendations for the oral health strategy, which would subsequently inform commissioning priorities in the local Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (JSNA ) and joint health and wellbeing board (JHWB) strategies. There is currently little clarity about the commissioning of oral health improvement programmes across the South West. Historical \"groupings\" currently exist, which are based around the current so urces of the commissioned service ie providers on the ground, as opposed to local authority geographical boundaries. The next stage will thus subsequently involve an analysis of current oral health improvement programme service provision (including commis sioning status), a review of the evidence base, and the development of needs based recommendations for an oral health strategy. This will form part of an overarching process to inform the JSNA, and input into the JHWB strategy. There may be a greater empha sis placed at this stage upon community and stakeholder engagement on information regarding both problems and possible solutions. Methodology The methodology adopted for this OHNA followed the Oral Health Needs Assessment Toolkit published by Primary Care Contracting (2006). Relevant data and information was accessed and analysed from a variety of sources which included : Survey data from National Epidemiology Surveys General dental practice access data from the Health and Social Information Centre Data fro m the Business Services Authority (BSA) Population and demographic data from the Office for National Statistics and South West PHE Knowledge and Intelligence Team Data and information from Local Area Teams: Quantitative and qualitative data on aspects of current service provision Secondary User Services data Literature review of the published and grey literature The data and information was collated and analysed. Interim findings are in the process of being presented to the \"North \"and \"South\" - specifi c Oral He alth Steering Groups (Appendix A), to review and test local findings and subsequently inform the development of the final report. 5 Context What is the role of local authorities in improving the oral health of children, and reducing oral health inequalities? From 1st April 2013 the statutory responsibility for the commissioning of oral health promotion transferred from the NHS to local authorities. The current dental public health functions of local authorities now include a statutory requiremen t to assess their local population's oral health needs, develop oral health strategies and commission or provide oral health improvement programmes (NHS Bodies and Local Authorities 2012). They must also provide or commission oral health surveys as part of the Public Health England Dental Public Health Intelligence Programme (NHS Dental Epidemiology Programme for England 2014). Local authorities can use these oral health surveys to: Assess and monitor oral health needs in their local population Plan and evaluate oral health improvement programmes Plan and evaluate NHS dental services Report and monitor the effects of any local water fluoridation schemes covering their local population Further guidance, Commissioning Better Oral Health for Children and Yo ung People: Local Authorities' Public Health Role is also due to be published imminently. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) will also be publishing the following public health guidance in October 2014 'Oral health: local authorit y strategies to improve oral health particularly among vulnerable groups.' Policy drivers, outcomes and indicators The government made a commitment to oral health and dentistry with a drive to (NHS England 2014; Department of Health 2010): The Public He alth Outcomes Framework (2013 -16) Domain 4 (Healthcare Public Health and Preventing Premature Mortality) includes an indicator related to \"tooth decay in five year old children\" (Department of Health 2012). Local authorities can use this indicator sourced from the Dental Public Health Intelligence Programme to monitor and evaluate children's oral health improvement programmes (Department of Health 2012a). The Children and Young People's Health Outcomes Framework (2014) and strategy recommends that an integ rated and partnership approach is needed to improve health outcomes for children and young people (Public Health England 2014) and also includes the \"tooth decay in five year old children\" indicator. 6 The NHS Outcomes Framework (2013 -14) includes indicato rs related to patients' experiences of NHS dental services (4aiii) and access to NHS dental services (4.4ii) (Department of Health 2012b). What advice and support can local authorities access from the dental public health workforce? The specialist dental public health workforce is now based within Public Health England (PHE) centres. They have a key role to support local authorities to deliver their oral health improvement functions. Oral health priorities in the South West Discussions at the \"North\" and \"South\" oral health steering groups highlighted how to date, a comprehensive oral health needs assessment had not been undertaken across the South West. Many local authorities did not have an up -to-date needs assessment, nor did oral health often appear in the JSNA / HWB strategy. As a result, the majority of local authorities did not also have an up to date, and fit for purpose oral health strategy (ie reflective of new commissioning responsibilities post April 2013). These perceptions were confirmed by a review of key strategic documents for each of the twelve Local Authorities: the most recent Director of Public Health Report; Joint Strategic Needs Assessment and Health an d Wellbeing Strategy (Appendix B ). Whilst \"oral health\" did not appear to be a p riority action -area for many local authorities, this was still a useful exercise to identify current health improvement strategies and initiatives, and key joint strategic and health and wellbeing priorities that may have an impact on oral health, and vice -versa. This will inform the development of needs based recommendations for the oral health strategy, which is due to be undertaken in the next stage of the project. 7 Good oral health is an integral part of general health The World Health Organisation ( 2013) defines oral health as being free from diseases and disorders that affect the oral cavity. This includes: chronic mouth and facial pain, oral and throat cancer, oral sores, birth defects such as cleft lip and palate, periodontal (gum) diseases, tooth decay and tooth loss. Oral health is integral to general health and should not be considered in isolation, as many of the key factors that lead to poor oral health are risk factors for other diseases. Chronic non - communicable diseases (NCDs) and conditio ns such as obesity, heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes and oral diseases all share a set of common risk factors including tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol, an unhealthy diet, and lack of physical activity. Furthermore oral disease itself may consti tute a risk factor for NCDs. It is for these reasons that there is now increasing acceptance that oral diseases cannot be dealt with in isolation from other systemic diseases (Glick et al 2012). In common with these major diseases of the twenty -first centu ry, major social gradients exist in the prevalence of oral disease (Sheiham et al 2011). Reducing the burden of NCDs is now recognised as one of the great challenges facing society on a global scale (United Nations 2011). 8 What are oral diseases? Key points Tooth decay occurs when acids in the produced from the breakdown of sugars, dissolve the outer layers of teeth. It is entirely preventable, but still the most common chronic childhood disease. Almost a third of all five year olds in England still ha d tooth decay in 2012. Gum or periodontal diseases are caused by inflammation of the gums and bone that support teeth. When severe, it can cause otherwise healthy teeth to be lost. Plaque deposits on the gum margins of teeth are the primary cause of diseas e. It affects a large proportion of the population and becomes more common with increasing age. Smoking is also a major risk factor in the development of the disease. Evidence linking periodontal health and general health is accumulating. Periodontal disea ses are associated with coronary heart disease; rheumatoid arthritis; Alzheimer's disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The link between severe periodontal disease and diabetes is the best established. Research suggests a two - way relationship between per iodontal disease and diabetes, where poorly controlled diabetes is a risk factor for developing periodontal disease, and the presence of periodontal disease may contribute to the development of diabetic complications. Oral cancer comprises a group of canc ers including cancer of the lip, tongue, mouth, and the airways. Oral cancer incidence rates have risen by a third in the last decade, making it one of the fastest -growing cancers in the UK. Tobacco and alcohol consumption are major risk factors. Oral canc er is now being increasingly seen in young adults, and has been attributed to increasing rates of infection with the Human Papilloma Virus, reflecting changes in oral sexual behaviour. The prevalence of tooth decay, tooth loss, oral cancer and the destruct ive form of periodontal disease follows the social gradient. The highest levels of disease exist among the most deprived and vulnerable population groups 9 Dental decay (tooth decay) Dental decay is the localised destruction of susceptible dental hard tissues by the acidic by-products from bacterial fermentation of dietary carbohydrates (Fejerskov and Kidd 2003). It is a preventable disease that can be arrested and even reversed in its early stages of development (Fisher -Owens et al 2007). Whils t decay is caused by acids produced from the breakdown of dietary carbohydrates, a wide range of factors have been implicated in its development. These are dominated by influences such as socio -demographic status, income, education, and behaviour. Macro -level factors include access to and use of fluorides; diet and access to preventive and restorative care services (Selwitz et al 2007). The relationship between ethnicity and oral health is complex. Children of Pakistani or Bangladeshi origin generally hav e higher than average levels of tooth decay in their first teeth, even after adjusting for socioeconomic status (Marshman 2013). Belonging to a family of Asian origin; or living with a Muslim family in which the mother speaks little English are also factor s associated with severe tooth decay (Rayner et al 2003). Despite general improvements in oral health in the last thirty years, dental caries is still a major public health problem and the most common chronic childhood disease, despite being entirely prev entable. Almost a third (27.9%) of all five year olds in England still had tooth decay in 2012 (NDEP 2013). Stark inequalities in oral health also persist, with the greatest burden existing in the most vulnerable and disadvantaged population groups (Do 201 2). Periodontal diseases (Gum disease) What causes periodontal diseases? Gum or periodontal diseases are caused by inflammation of the gums and bone that support and anchor teeth. When severe, the bony support for teeth is extensively compromised causing otherwise healthy teeth to be lost. There are a number of gum (or periodontal) diseases. However, the disease with the most public health implications is chronic periodontitis in adults. Chronic periodontitis can cause bleeding gums, loss of fibres and bon e that hold the teeth in place, recession of gums, periodontal abscesses, drifting of teeth, tooth mobility and ultimately tooth loss. These symptoms can have a significant impact on the individual ranging from halitosis (smelly breath) and discomfort, to changes in appearance and loss of function (Corbet 2007). It is a multifactorial disease, but it is essentially an inflammatory reaction to the presence of dental plaque . Dental plaque is the diverse bacterial community embedded in a matrix of compounds of bacterial and salivary origin that forms naturally on the surface of teeth (Marsh and Bradshaw 1995). Preventive measures thus focus on establishing excellent oral hygiene, to restrict the accumulation of dental plaque that triggers inflammation. Other 10 factors that increase susceptibility include stress, genetic disorders and local factors, such as crowded teeth (Corbet 2007). Smoking is a major risk factor for the development of periodontal disease (Bergstrom 2006; Gelskey 1999). The prevalence rates an d severity of periodontal disease increases in relation to the number of cigarettes consumed and years of smoking (Kibayashi et al 2007; Calsina et al 2002; Tomar and Asma 2000), but stopping smoking leads to a lower risk of periodontal disease (Kinane and Chestnutt 2000). Studies have shown that smoking may account for more than half of the cases of periodontitis among adults (Tomar and Asma 2000). Periodontal diseases tend to be more prevalent in men than women (Shiau and Reynolds 2010). In addition to th e impact of age (Kandelman et al 2008) and ethnicity (Marshman 2013), it is also well established that the greatest burden of periodontal disease lies within the disadvantaged population groups. Periodontitis: other important health considerations Period ontitis may have long term consequences for health by increasing the risk of obesity (Chaffee and Weston 2010), metabolic syndrome (D'Aiuto et al 2008), cardiovascular diseases and pulmonary diseases (Li et al 2010; Tonetti et al 2007); Alzheimer's disease (Poole et al 2014) and adverse pregnancy outcomes (Scannapieco et al 2010). Of the associations purported to exist between oral health status, periodontal disease and chronic systemic diseases, the link between severe periodontal disease and diabetes i s the best established. Recent research suggests a bidirectional relationship between periodontal disease and diabetes (Taylor 2010). The presence of poorly controlled diabetes is a risk factor for developing periodontal disease. On the other hand, the pr esence of periodontal disease may adversely affect glycaemic control, and contribute to the development of diabetic complications (Ray et al 2012; Taylor and Borgnakke 2008). It has also been shown that periodontal therapy may result in a modest improvemen t of glycaemic control in patients with diabetes (Lalla and Papapanou 2011), but a firm causal relationship remains to be established. Oral cancer The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD10) defines oral cancers within the ICD 10 classification. Mouth cancer is often defined as C00 -C06, C09 -C10 and C12 -C14 tongue, mouth, oropharynx, piriform sinus, hypopharynx and other and ill -defined sites of the lip , oral cavity and pharynx). As there is no standard definition of oral cancer and different studies report data using different combinations of ICD10 codes caution needs to be applied when making comparisons between analyses. 11 The causes of oral cancer are predominantly lifestyle -related and these include alcohol abuse; tobacco use (smoking; smokeless; diet; and ionising radiation (Parkin et al 2010). Smoking and alcohol are major contributory factors. More than two -thirds of oral cancers in men and more than half in women in the UK are caused by smoking (Parkin et al 2011a). More than a third of oral cancers in men and around a sixth in women in the UK are linked to alcoh ol consumption (Parkin et al 2011b). Oral and pharyngeal cancer risk is almost tripled in alcohol drinkers who currently smoke tobacco (Hashibe et al 2007). A diet rich in fruit and vegetables reduces oral cancer risk and more than half of oral cancer case s in the UK are linked to insufficient fruit and vegetable intake (Parkin and Boyd 2011). Finally, it is well established that oral cancer incidence is strongly associated with deprivation. 12 The impact of poor oral health Key points Preventing dental decay is of crucial importance, as the burden of the disease lasts a lifetime. Once the tooth structure is compromised, restoration and additional maintenance will be req uired throughout the life of the affected tooth. In adults, poor oral health can lead to oral pain, premature tooth loss, dry mouth, and sleep deprivation. The experience of pain, problems with speaking, eating and chewing, and embarrassment regarding the appearance of their teeth may distract people from performing daily activities and affect their social and psychological well - being, and general quality of life. National survey findings confirm the scientific literature: - The general perception of adults about their dental health was quite positive, with 71% saying that it was good, or very good. But in the South West, the equivalent value was slightly lower at 68%. - The most commonly reported problems nationally were physical pain (30%) and psychological discomfort (19 %) - 34% of dentate adults in the South West reported that they had experienced pain in their mouths occasionally/ fairly or very often, in the previous 12 months, above the national average of 30% - 33% of adults nationally described difficulties in eating (21%), smiling (15%), cleaning teeth (13%) and relaxing (10%). Untreated decay can affect a child's general health and wellbeing. Due to oral pain and difficulties in eating, poor oral health in children is associated with being unde rweight and a failure to thrive. It also affects a child's confidence as well as ability to sleep, eat, speak, play and socialise with other children Children with dental problems may not be able to gain the full benefit of their education, if they are su ffering pain and discomfort. Good oral health can contribute to \"school readiness\", ensuring that all children are able to participate fully in all activities in order to be successful at school. Studies have shown that children with poor oral health have increased school absenteeism, and decreased school performance. 13 The impact of poor oral health in children Untreated decay can affect a child's general health and wellbeing. Due to oral pain and difficulties in eating, poor oral health in children i s associated with being underweight and a failure to thrive (Sheiham 2006). Severe childhood decay can also seriously compromise the quality of life and daily living of both children, and consequently their parents. It affects a child's ability to sleep , eat, speak, play and socialise with other children (Nuttall and Harker 2003). Alongside this, oral diseases can have a considerable impact on a child's self -esteem and confidence (Tsakos et al 2012). Children with dental problems may not be able to gain the full benefit of their education, if they are suffering pain and discomfort. In this way, good oral health is an important aspect of overall health status, and can contribute to \"school readiness\", ensuring that all children are able to participate fu lly in all activities in order to be successful at school. Studies have shown that children with poor oral health have increased school absenteeism, and decreased school performance (Jackson et al 2011; Blumenshine et al 2008; Muirhead and Marcenes 2004). The impact of poor oral health in adults Dental decay occurs across the life course and people are susceptible to the disease throughout their lives. Preventing dental decay is of crucial importance, as the burden of the disease lasts a lifetime. Once th e tooth structure is compromised, restoration and additional maintenance will be required throughout the life of the affected tooth. Poor oral health can affect general oral functioning leading to pain, premature tooth loss, dry mouth, and sleep deprivatio n. The experience of pain, problems with speaking, eating and chewing, and embarrassment regarding the appearance of teeth may distract people from performing daily activities and affect their social and psychological well-being, and general quality of lif e (Slade et al 1998). National data from 2009 Adult Dental Health Survey reports information collected on the interviewer -administered questionnaire, and presents estimates on the subjective perceptions of respondents in relation to their general health, oral health and quality of life. Two measures of oral health related quality of life were used to collect information: the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP -14) and the Oral Impacts on Daily Performance (OIDP). Both of these scales reflect on the potential impact of oral conditions on the daily life of people; however the OHIP -14 measures the frequency of oral impacts, while the OIDP assessed the severity of the effect of oral impacts on the daily life of respondents. 14 The findings in the literature are ref lected in the 2009 national Adult Dental Health Survey results (HSCIC 2011): 15% of dentate and 13% of edentate adults reported that oral conditions had a severe negative effect on their daily life. Nationally, the general perception of adults about their dental health was quite positive, with 71% saying that it was good, or very good. But in the South West, the equivalent value was slightly lower at 68%. The most commonly reported OHIP -14 problems w ere included in the categories of physical pain (30%) and psychological discomfort (19 %) 34% of dentate adults in the South West reported that they had experienced pain in their mouths occasionally/ fairly or very often, in the previous 12 months, above t he national average of 30% 33% of adults said they had difficulty performing at least one element of the Oral Impacts on Daily Performance. The more prevalent oral impacts among adults were difficulty eating (21%), smiling (15%), cleaning teeth (13%) and r elaxing (10%). 15 The economic impact of oral disease Key points Oral diseases remain a very significant public health issue for the South West. This is disturbing, given that much of the oral disease burden is due to tooth decay and its complications, which are preventable using cost -effective community -based prevention strategies Global studies have indicated that the mouth is the most expensive part of the body to treat. NHS expenditure on the treatment of oral disease is significant, likely to excee d that for other diseases, including cancer, heart disease, stroke, and dementia In 2011/12 the total NHS cost of extracting multiple decayed teeth in children in hospitals was approximately \u00a323 million - life threatening treatment for an entirely preventa ble disease Given that periodontal diseases constitute a major risk factor in the development of Type 2 Diabetes, the economic impact of these conditions must also be considered Dental disease and its sequalae can impose a significant financial burden to an individual and society. In the UK, the costs of maintaining teeth, especially for adults in the second half of their lives, who frequently have heavily restored teeth, appears to be rising. There are also indirect costs to consider, arising from the soc ial burdens of poor oral health, and time off work. This burden is increased, as more and more people retain their teeth later and later into life. Direct costs of oral disease In some industrialised countries, the mouth is the most expensive part of the body to treat (Bauer et al 2009; Schneider et al 1998; Kohlmeier et al 1993) with expenditure on treatment often exceeding that for other major diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and dementia. These economic costs are significant. Given that oral disease constitutes a major risk factor in the development of NCDs, such as diabetes, the economic impact of these conditions must also be considered. The potential cost of NCDs to economies, households and individuals is significant. For e xample, the cost to the health budget of managing people with diabetes in the UK is substantial: 5% of total National Health Service resources and up to 10% of hospital in -patient resources are used for the care of people with diabetes (DH 2001). Dental disease and its complications can impose a significant financial burden to an individual. For example, in the UK, the costs of maintaining teeth, especially for adults in the second half of their lives, who frequently have heavily restored teeth, ap pears to be rising (Steele Report 2009). Alongside this, fluctuations in socioeconomic circumstances may have a significant impact on oral health, where patients may delay consultation and treatment during economic downturns. 16 This burden, and the subsequ ent costs will increase, as more and more people retain their teeth later and later into life. Indirect costs of oral disease As one of the most common chronic diseases, dental decay leads to significant absenteeism from work in adults, resulting in both short - and long -term impacts on economic productivity. In the USA, is has been estimated that employed adults lose more than 164 million hours of work each year due to dental disease or dental visits (USHHS 2000). Furthermore, research has shown how parent s can lose up to two and a half days on average, from work or school per year, because of their children's dental problems (Seirawan et al 2012). Assessing the cost -effectiveness of oral health improvement interventions The challenges of assessing the he alth-economic effects of oral health preventive interventions are well accepted in the literature. However, studies have highlighted how the benefits of preventing tooth decay exceed the costs of treatment (Oscarson 2007, Burt 1998), as well as the cost -effectiveness of using a fluoride toothpaste to prevent dental caries (Davies 2003; Yee 2004). Furthermore, savings in dental expenditure have been demonstrated in countries such as Denmark and Sweden, which have invested in the provision of preventive oral health services, and where positive trends have been noted in terms of reduction in the prevalence of oral disease (Wang et al. 1998). Finally, a study analysing the USA oral health system describes the global situation: \"A system focused primarily on treatment of disease in individuals is not economically sustainable, socially desirable, or ethically responsible. The understanding exists to prevent a very large proportion of oral diseases (Gooch et al. 2009 Truman et al. 2002), and community -based pre vention generally is cost -saving compared with a treatment -focused approach, particularly for communities and individuals at high risk for disease\" (Tomar and Cohen 2010). 17 Oral health in children and young adults in the South West: Tooth decay Introduction This section describes the oral health status in children and young adults in the South West. Data are presented from: the 2011/12 National Dental Epidemiology Programme oral health survey of five year old children (NDEP 2013) and 2008/09 or al health survey of twelve year old children (NDEP 2010). Data have also been extrapolated from the Hospital Episode Statistics dataset which records inpatient care from NHS hospitals across England. This database provides details about admission of childr en and young people (0 -19 years) to hospital for extraction of one or more decayed primary or permanent teeth (NDEP 2014). The following data have been reported, according to three Area Team Boundaries Prevalence and severity of dental caries Average num ber of dentinally decayed, missing and filled teeth (d3mft) among five year old children with decay experience Proportion of children whose teeth with caries have been filled (as indicated by the care index) Proportion of children with extracted teeth (due to dental decay) Proportion of children with sepsis at the time of the examination Proportion of children and young adults admitted to hospital for dental extractions The NHS Dental Epidemiology Programme (NDEP) and surveys of child dental health: Methodology and sampling considerations Standardised and coordinated surveys of child dental health have been conducted across the UK since 1985. In England, surveys of child dental health have provided informat ion for use at local, regional and national levels. At a national level, the British Association for the Study of Community Dentistry (BASCD) were previously responsible for co -ordinating regular surveys of children's teeth. The successor, NHS Dental Epide miology Programme, supported by the Dental Observatory (North West Public Health Observatory), became part of the Knowledge and Intelligence Directorate of Public Health England in April 2013. This responsibility was transferred to local authorities on 1st April 2013. The purpose of the surveys is to provide information on the current state of children's teeth and oral health, and to measure changes in oral health over time. At age five, children usually have 20 deciduous teeth. Dental caries is a common method of benchmarking dental health. It is measured using the d 3mft index and is a record of the number of decayed (d 3), missing (m) and filled (f) teeth (t). By convention, 18 lower case d 3mft is used to denote primary (baby) teeth. Data are usually expres sed as d3mft, where a tooth is considered as decayed when there is obvious irreversible decay into the dentine of the tooth. The proportion of children with decay experience (d 3mft>0) is used as proxy measure for decay prevalence. In September 2013 the d ata from the 2011/12 National Dental Epidemiology Programme oral health survey of five year old children were released. The following section summarises the data for lower and upper tier local authorities across the South West, and reports the prevalence a nd severity of dental caries in five year old children attending state schools, as well as details of the proportion of children whose teeth have been filled, extracted, and who showed signs of sepsis at the time of the examination. Analysis is also unde rtaken of the 2008/09 NHS Dental Epidemiology Programme for England Oral Health Survey of twelve year old children, to provide a similar indicative picture of this age group. The survey reported here provides information on the caries prevalence and severi ty of twelve year olds resident in LAs and PCTs in England, attending state schools . This survey records oral health status of the permanent (adult) dentition, and upper case D3MFT is used to denote these permanent teeth. It should be noted that Upper Tier Local Authority data is not available, as this data was only reported at Primary Care Trust level. For five year olds, comparisons can be made between the results of the 2011/12 and 2007/08 surveys as these surveys were methodologically consistent, with the same positive consent requirement and weighting applied. Most recently, a survey was undertaken of the oral health of three year old children in the school year 2012 -13. This is the first national dental survey of this age group in England. The sampling frame was children attending state or privately funded nurs eries, nursery classes attached to schools and playgroups who were aged three years at the time of the survey. It has not been possible to include children who do not attend such sites and the possibility for bias from this is acknowledged but could not be measured. A total of 53,640 clinical examinations were linked to geographical areas and included in the final analysis which represented 8% of the population of this age cohort, and 97% of those children examined. The proportion of children who particip ated in the survey varied at regional and upper and lower tier local authority level and analysts stated that this probably reflected the provision of child care in different areas, which impacts upon the ability to access children. The actual number exami ned was also less than the drawn sample; loss of subjects occurred through failure of those with parental responsibility to provide consent, absence from the care setting on the day of examination, and unwillingness of the child to permit examination. 19 The confidence limits are reported, and are very wide at lower tier level for this age group; some sample sizes being very small. Given this, and the limitations of how far those children examined represent the whole three year old population, restricts the validity and therefore the utility of these data. Caution is needed in their application to locality planning and prioritisation and evaluation of health improvement interventions. For the following graphs, the 95% Confidence limits provide the upper and l ower range between which we are 95% confident the true value is contained. These are shown as error bars. Understanding the problems: Nationally Prevalence of dental decay at age three The proportion of the population who have decay experience is used as a proxy for prevalence. Whilst children's oral health has improved over the past 20 years, across England, 12% of three year old children still had experience of obvious dental decay, having one or more teeth that were decayed to dentinal level, extracted or filled because of tooth decay (%d3mft>0). The remaining 88% were free from visually obvious dental decay. Across the regions, estimates ranged from 8% in the East of England to 16% in the East Midlands (Fig 1 ). The equivalent figure in the South West wa s 10.4%, below the average for England. At the upper tier local authority level there were wider variations, ranging from South Gloucestershire where only 2% had experience of decay, to Leicester where 34% were affected. Figure 1: Percentage of three -year -old children with decay experience (d3mft > 0) in England by government region, 2013 (NDEP 2014) 20 Prevalence of dental decay at age five Almost a third (27.9%) of five year olds had tooth decay in 2012 (PHE 2013). This equates to approximately 177,423 five year olds in England who had some experience of tooth decay with 155,801 of five year olds having one or more untreated decayed tooth (NDEP 2013). Across the regions, estimates ranged from 21.2% in the South East to 34.8% in t he North West. The equivalent figure in the South West was 26.1%, slightly below the national average (Figure 2 ). Figure 2: Percentage of five year old children with decay experience (d3mft > 0) in England by region (PHE 2013) Prevalence of dental decay at age twelve At a national level 33.4% of pupils were found to have experience of caries, having one or more teeth which were decayed to dentinal level, extracted or filled because of caries. In the South West, this equivalent figure was 33.3%, just belo w the national average. Figure 3 shows the differences across the country at strategic health authority (SHA) level. 21 Figure 3: Percentage of twelve year old children with decay experience (D3MFT > 0) by Strategic Health Authority (NDEP 2009 ) 22 Changes in time in the oral health of five year olds Comparison between 2011/12 and 2007/08 survey: decay experience The 2008 and 2012 surveys were methodologically consistent with the same positive consent requirement and weighting applied. It is therefore possible to directly compare the results from these surveys. T he response rates were similar in both years at 66.8% in 2008, and 65.2% in 2012. It is possible that there is still some bias, and in making comparisons reference should be made to the response levels, particularly when the sample sizes are small. In the majority of Local Authorities the percentage of five year old children with decay experience has decreased when data between the two surveys is compared. Data was not available from the 2007/08 survey for Tewkesbury, Cheltenham and Forest of Dean and so comparisons cannot be made. The increases in Stroud and Cotswold are Figure 4: Percentage of 5 year old children with decay experience (2011/12 and 2007/08) (NDEP) 23 Understanding the oral health of , Wiltshire The proportion of the population who have tooth decay experience is used here as a proxy for prevalence. At a national level, whilst children's oral health has improved over the past 20 years. For each cohort of three, five and twelve year olds the respect ive surveys have demonstrated that the situation in the South West in terms of decay prevalence for these children is better than the national average. However, population averages can mask inequalities in oral health. Analysis indicate how a polarisation in disease experience is occurring, with an increasing number of children remaining tooth decay free, and the disease becoming concentrated in a diminishing number of social deprived children. Three year olds Caution is needed in the interpretation of this data due to very wide confidence intervals for this age group, and small sample sizes. Dental decay prevalence was higher than the national average of 11.7% in Wiltshire (13.5%), and Gloucestershire (12.6%). The average number of teeth per child affected by decay (decayed, missing or filled teeth) was just below the national average in Wiltshire. Early childhood caries is an aggressive form of decay that affects upper front teeth, and can be rapid and extensi ve in attack. It is associated with long term bottle use with sugar -sweetened drinks, especially when these are given overnight or for long periods of the day. Analysis shows how the percentage of three year old children with ECC was higher than the averag e in the South West of 3%, in Wiltshire (3.2%), but lower than the national average (3.9%). In terms of acute disease, across the South West, an average of 0.2% of three year old children showed signs of sepsis and, as expected, the level was generally hig her in those areas where there were higher levels of decay. For example, within the Area Team, the highest levels occurred in Gloucestershire (0.3%). Untreated caries can give rise to infection of the tooth pulp, which can spread to the supporting tissues and the jaws, culminating in advanced disease conditions that are often painful. The impact of such acute conditions are substantial, and research suggests that poor oral health in children is associated with being underweight and a failure to thrive. The implications are serious as such teeth will often require extraction, usually under a general anaesthesia, exposing children to small, but significant risks of life -threatening complications, for an essentially, entirely preventable disease. Five year old s In the population of five year olds, dental decay prevalence in Gloucestershire is higher than the England average. At a lower tier level, in the Forest of Dean, and Gloucester, the prevalence and severity of decay are substantially higher than the natio nal averages. There is an underlying trend of worse decay in those children who have any decay. If only those children who already have decay are considered, and the number of decayed teeth are 24 measured, then it is possible to ascertain this burden of dis ease. It appears that in Swindon, and at a lower tier level, Gloucester, those children who have decay, have a higher level of decay than the England average. This suggests that a small number of children experience most decay. Children who have on average 3 to 4 decayed teeth are more likely to be living in deprivation, and are less likely to access dental services. When they do access services they may not receive definitive treatment. In terms of acute disease, in Cotswold and Tewkesbury, the percentage of children with obvious oral abscess/sepsis is higher than the national average. In Wiltshire, Swindon, and Bath and North East Somerset, the number of children and adolescent hospital admissions, as a percentage of the population, for a dental extraction , is higher than the national average. The most common age for admission is 5 -9 years in these areas. This dataset does not include those extractions carried out by community dental services, which thus means the figures are likely to be an underestimation . In terms of trend analysis, in the majority of local authorities, the percentage of five year old children with decay experience has decreased when data between the two surveys (2007/08 and 20011/12) is compared. Twelve year olds Within the twelve year o ld population, in Wiltshire, the prevalence, severity and burden of disease (in those children who already have decay) are higher than the national averages. 25 Sample information: Survey of three year olds (NDEP 2014) Details of the sample from Bath, Gloucestershire , Swindon, and Wiltshire Area Team boundaries are detailed below at Upper and Lower Tier Local Authority level.

The survey on three year olds does provide data to lower tier local authority, level but these are likely to have limited practical value. Sample numbers are ver y small, and confidence intervals wide. For this reason, the data only presented at Upper Tier Local Authority level. Across England, 11.7% of three year old children had experience of obvious dental decay, having one or more teeth that were decayed to dentinal level, extracted or filled because of caries (%d3mft>0). The remaining 88% were free from visually obvious denta l decay. Across the Area Team boundaries, dental decay prevalence was higher than the England average in Bristol LA Figure 5: Percentage of three year old children with decay experience (d3mft>0) including incisors by Upper Tier Local Authority A rea (NDEP 2014 ) 30 Prevalence of dental decay at age five The 2011/2012 data for the prevalence of dental decay across the South West, in five year olds, ranged from 35.7% in Torbay to 14.3% in the Isles of Scilly. Dental decay prevalence is higher than the England average (27.9%) in three local authority areas: Torbay (35.7%); North Somerset (30%) and Gloucestershire (28%). Population averages can mask oral health inequalities. Local data demonstrate that the prevalence of dental decay in five year olds ranged from 46.6% in the Forest of Dean to 16.3% in Tewkesbury. Dental decay prevalence is higher than the England average (27.9%) in two local authority areas: Forest of Authority Figure 6: Percentage of five year old children with decay experience (d3mft>0) by Upper Tier Local Authority Area (N Cotswold Tewkesbury%d3mft>0 Lower Tier Local Authority Figure 7: Percentage of five year old children with decay experience (d3mft>0) by Lower Tier Local Authority Area (N DEP 2013) 32 Prevalence of dental decay at age twelve 33.4% of twelve year old pupils nationally were found to have experience of caries by having one or more D3MFT.

Across the South West, the mean d3mft ranged from 1.03 in Torbay to 0.29 in the Isles of Scilly. The data show that the mean d3mft in Torbay (1.03) is higher than the England mean (0.94).

In Bristol (1.06); (0.97); Somerset the average number of teeth per child affected by decay was above the national average of 0.74. Local data demonstrate that generally, oral health in the twelve year old population is better than the national average (0.74). In Gloucester, an d the Forest of Dean, despite mean D3MFT scores below the national average, the associated confidence intervals still indicate that some twelve year olds here are also experiencing dental decay above the national average. 1.06 0.97 0.83 Mean D3MF T in twelve year old children by Primary Care Trust (NDEP 2010) 38 0.74 0.73 0.64 0.60 0.50 0.42 Cotswold CheltenhamMean D3MFT Lower Tier Local Authority Figure 14: Mean D3MFT by Lower Tier Local Authority in twelve year old children (NDEP 2010) 39 Prevalence of early childhood caries in three year olds For the first time data was collected that allowed for investigation into a speci fic type of caries called early childhood caries (ECC). This is an aggressive form of decay that affects upper incisors and can be rapid and extensive in attack. It is associated with long term bottle use with sugar -sweetened drinks, especially when these are given overnight or for long periods of the day. The definition of ECC used here is: \"Caries affecting any surface of one or more upper primary incisors, regardless of the caries status of any other teeth (Davies et al. 2010). Analysis shows how the pe rcentage of three year old children with ECC was higher than the national average of 3.9% in Bristol (5.7%) and Torbay (5.2). Disease burden in those five year old children who have decay The average d3mft for the whole sampled population can be compared over time and is an important statistical indicator; however, it does not clearly identify the disease burden in those children who already have decay. A greater understanding about the ex tent of disease in the mouths of children affected can be obtained by calculating the average number of decayed, missing or filled teeth in this group with decay. This is referred to as d3mft>0. A child aged five normally has 20 primary teeth. In England f or those children with decay experience, the average number of decayed, missing (due to Tier LA Figure 15: Percentage of three year olds with early childhood caries (ECC) by Upper Tier Local Authority (NDEP 2014 ) 40 teeth is 3.38. Across the South West, two local authority areas have higher values than this. These are Cornwall (3.66) and Swindon (3.39).

At a lower tier level, data demonstrate that generally, the burden of disease in those children who have decay is better than the national average. However, in Gloucester, Forest of Dean, Cheltenham, Tewkesbury and Cotswold, despite an overall score below the national average, the associated confidence intervals still indicate that some twelve year olds here who already have decay, are also experiencing dental decay levels above the national average. 2.21 2.19 2.19 2.09 1.92 1.87 1.80 1.65 0.000.501.001.502.002.503.00 Forest of DeanCheltenham Tewkesbury Cotswold StroudMean D3MFT (%D3MFT>0) 2.24 2.21 2.19 number of missing (due to decay) and filled teeth (D3MFT) among twelve year old children with decay experience (D3MFT>0) by Primary Care Trust (NDEP 2010) Figure 19: Average number of dentinally decayed, missing (due to decay) and filled teeth (D3MFT) among twelve year old children with deca y experience (D3MFT>0) by Lower Tier Local Authority (NDEP 2010) 42 Dental treatment received by five year olds The care index The care index is the proportion of teeth with caries that have been filled. It gives an indication of the restorative care received by children with decay, by dentists. It is derived by taking the number of filled teeth and dividing by the total number of dentinally decayed, missing and filled teeth and converting to a percentage (ft/d3mft). In using this care index data, care should be taken in making assumptions about the extent or the quality of clinical care available. The higher the care index the mor e fillings have been undertaken. The care index was 11.2% across England as a whole, showing that just over a tenth of decayed teeth are treated by filling them. This index varied between 16.4% in Devon to 5.7% in Gloucestershire. There is considerable va riation within the region. The values for Plymouth (11%); Bristol (10.2%); Cornwall (9%); Bath and North East Somerset (8.9); Wiltshire (6.4%) and Gloucestershire (5.7%) are below the national average which suggests that children in these areas may not nec essarily be gaining the appropriate access and/or dental treatment that is required. 43 *Note: data from Isles of Scilly Authority Figure 20: Care index among five year old children by Upper Tier Local Authority Area (NDEP 2013) Care Index 44 Local data suggest that in Tewkesbury (12%) the care index for five year olds is below the South West average (12.2%) indicating that children in this locality may not be gaining the appropriate access and/or dental treatment that is required.

The care index is thus solely a measure of restoration of teeth. Where multiple teeth are decayed in five year olds, extraction of teeth may be required (possibly under general anaesthetic). The proportion of five year old children who had one or more teeth extracted on one or more occasions across England was 3.1%. Across the South West, the equivalent values for Plymouth (4.3%) and Bristol (3.5%) were above Local Authority Figure 24: Percentage of five year old children with one or more teeth extracted due to dental decay (%Mt >0) by Upper Tier Local Authority Area (NDEP 2013) 48 Local data demonstrate how across this area, although all local authorities show lower values than the nation al average (3.1%), in Gloucester (2.7%), these proportions are above the average for the South West (2.2%). Figure 25: Percentage of five year old children with one or more teeth extracted due to dental decay (%Mt >0) by Lower Tier Local Authority 49 Three year old children with sepsis at the time of the examination Among three year olds, virtually all sepsis will be the result of the dental decay process rather than originating from gum problems. Sepsis was defined in the protocol as the presence of a dental abscess or sinus recorded by visual examination of the soft tissues. Untreated caries can give rise to infection of the tooth pulp, which can spread to the supporting tissues and the jaws, culminating in advanced di sease conditions that are often painful. The impact of such acute conditions are substantial, and research suggests that poor oral health in children is associated with being underweight and a failure to thrive (Sheiham 2006). Across England 0.4% of three year old children showed signs of sepsis and, as expected, the level was generally higher in those areas where there were higher levels of decay. For example, the highest levels occurred in Bristol (1%) and Somerset (0.8%), above the England average. Tier LA Figure 26: Percentage of t hree year old children with sepsis at the time of the examination by Upper Tier Local Authority Area (NDEP 2014 ) 50 Five year old children with sepsis at the time of the examination Among five year olds nearly all sepsis will be the result of the dental decay process rather than originating from gum problems. Across England 1.7% of five year old children showed signs of sepsis. In the South West, there is signific ant variation with the highest levels in Cornwall (6.2%) and the lowest in the Isles of Scilly; North 27: Percentage of five year old children with evidence of sepsis by Upper Tier Local Authority Area (NDEP 2013) Upper Tier Local Authority 51 Local data show how the percentage of children with obvious abscess/sepsis was higher than the national average (1.7%) in Cotswold (2.6%) and Tewkesbury (1.8%). The implic ations are serious as such teeth will often require extraction, usually under a general anaesthesia, exposing children to unnecessary risk of complications. This is a serious health issue which can, and should be prevented. Figure 28: Percentage of five year old children with evidence of sepsis by Lower Tier Local Authority Area Forest of Dean% Abcess/Sepsis Local Authority 52 Hospital admissions for dental extractions in children and young people (0 -19 years) Data have also been extrapolated from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) dataset which records inpatient care from National Health Service (NHS) hospitals across England. This database provid es details about admission of children and young people (0-19 years) to hospital for extraction of one or more decayed primary or permanent teeth. No assumptions can be made about the method of anaesthesia provided for these procedures but it is likely tha t the majority of episodes involved general anaesthetic. The vast majority of teeth extracted will have been removed because of decay, a minority for other reasons such as orthodontics. In 2012/13, 6415 children and young people across the South West had teeth extracted under a general anaesthetic due to dental decay, and the most common age was 5 -9 years. Such procedures expose children to small, but significant risks of life -threatening complications (Royal College of Anaesthetists 2008) for an essential ly, entirely preventable disease. Figure 29 shows the variation in hospital admissions for dental extractions by government office region. This variation reflects a combination of differing levels of dental disease, local service provision and data collec tion but may not capture all dental extractions including extractions carried out by community dental services on a sessional basis. This probably means that these figures are an underestimation. 53 Local data, by former PCT of residence, demonstrate how in Wiltsh ire, Swindon and BANES, the number of children and adolescent admissions, as a percentage of the population (0.6%) are higher than the England average of 0.5%. The most commen age for admission is 5 -9 years in these areas.

The oral health of three year olds is generally poorer in Bristol than national averages. Dental decay prevalence was higher in Bristol (15.3%) than the England average of 11.7%. The average number of teeth per child affected by decay (decayed, missing or filled teeth) in Bristol was 0.7, higher than the national average of 0.4. Early childhood caries is an aggressive form of decay that affects upper front teeth, and can be rapid and extensive in atta ck. It is associated with long term bottle use with sugar -sweetened drinks, especially when these are given overnight or for long periods of the day. Analysis shows how the percentage of three year old children with ECC was higher than the national average of 3.9% in Bristol (5.7%). Across England 0.4% of three year old children showed signs of sepsis and, as expected, the level was generally higher in those areas where there were higher levels of decay. For example, the highest levels occurred in Bristol ( 1%), above the England average. Untreated caries can give rise to infection of the tooth pulp, which can spread to the supporting tissues and the jaws, culminating in advanced disease conditions that are often painful. The impact of such acute conditions a re substantial, and research suggests that poor oral health in children is associated with being underweight and a failure to thrive. The implications are serious as such teeth will often require extraction, usually under a general anaesthesia, exposing ch ildren to small, but significant risks of life -threatening complications, for an essentially, entirely preventable disease. Five year olds In the population of five year olds, dental decay prevalence in North Somerset is higher than the England average. There is an underlying trend of worse decay in those children who have any decay. If only those children who already have decay are considered, and the number of decayed teeth are measured, then it is possible to ascertain this burden of disease. It appears that those children in West Somerset and Sedgemoor, who have decay, have a higher level of decay than the England average (3.38). This suggests that a small number of children experience most decay. Children who have on average 3 to 4 decayed teeth are mo re likely to be living in deprivation, 57 and are less likely to access dental services. When they do access services they may not receive definitive treatment. In terms of acute disease, the percentage of children with obvious oral abscess/sepsis in Somerset (1.68%), is above the average for the South West (1.57%), and just below the national average of 1.74%. At lower tier level, the percentage of children with obvious abscess/sepsis was higher than the national average (1.74%) in West Somerset (3.2%) and Sedgemoor (3.1%). In Bristol (0.7%) and North Somerset (0.6%), the number of children and adolescent hospital admissions, for a dental extraction, as a percentage of the population is higher than the national average (0.5%). The most common age for admissio n is 5 -9 years in these areas. In Sedgemoor and West Somerset (0.9% of the population), this occurs at percentages higher than the national average at that age group (0.8%). This dataset does not include those extractions carried out by community dental se rvices, which thus means the figures are likely to be an underestimation. In terms of trend analysis, in the majority of local authorities, the percentage of five year old children with decay experience has decreased when data between the two surveys (2007 /08 and 20011/12) is compared. The exceptions are in North Somerset and South Gloucestershire where the prevalence has increased. Twelve year olds The prevalence of decay was higher than the national average (33.4%) in Bristol (39.8%); Somerset (36.6%); an d North Somerset (33.9%). At lower tier authority level, the prevalence of dental decay in twelve year olds was higher than the national average in West Somerset (45.5%); Taunton Deane (40.7%); and Sedgemoor (39.4%). In Bristol (1.06) and Somerset (0.83) t he average number of teeth per child affected by decay was above the national average of 0.74. Those children in Bristol (2.67) and Somerset (2.28); and at a lower tier level, West Somerset (2.6), Sedgemoor (2.51) and Taunton Deane (2.27) who have decay, h ave a higher level of decay than the England average (2.21). 58 Sample information: Survey of five year olds (NDEP 2014) Details of the sample from Bristol, North Somerset, Somerset and South Gloucester (BNSSSG) Area Team boundaries are detailed below at Upper and Lower Tier Local Authority level.

It is therefore possible to directly compare the results from these surveys. The response rates were similar in both years at 66.8% in 2008, and 65.2% in 2012. It is possible that there is still some bias, and in making comparisons reference should be made to the response levels, particularly when the sample si zes are small. In the majority of local authorities the percentage of five year old children with decay experience has decreased when data between the two surveys is compared. The exceptions are in North Somerset and South Gloucestershire where the prevale nce has increased. 2007/08 2011/12 Figure 30: Percentage of 5 year old children with decay experience (2011/12 and 2007/08) (NDEP) 63 Prevalence of dental decay at age three The proportion of the population who have decay experience is used as a proxy for prevalence. The survey on three year olds does provide data to lower tier local authority, level but these are likely to have limited practical value. Sample numbers are ver y small, and confidence intervals wide. For this reason, the data only presented at Upper Tier Local Authority level. Across England, 11.7% of three year old children had experience of obvious dental decay, having one or more teeth that were decayed to de ntinal level, extracted or filled because of caries (%d3mft>0). The remaining 88% were free from visually obvious dental decay. Across the Area Team boundaries, dental decay prevalence was higher than the England average in Bristol (15.3%), Figure 31: Percentage of three year old children with decay experience (d3mft>0) including incisors by Upper Tier Local Authority A rea (NDEP 2014 ) 64 Prevalence of dental decay at age five The 2011/2012 data for the prevalence of dental decay across the South West, in five year olds, ranged from 35.7% in Torbay to 14.3% in the Isles of Scilly. Dental decay prevalence is higher than the England average (27.9%) in three local authority areas: Torbay (35.7%); North Somerset (30%) and Gloucestershire (28 %). .

Across the South West, the mean d3mft ranged from 1.03 in Torbay to 0.29 in the Isles of Scilly. The data show that the mean d3mft in Torbay (1.03) is higher than the England mean (0.94).

In Bristol (1.06); (0.97); Somerset the average number of teeth per child affected by decay was above the national average of 0.74. At lower tier level it is evident that the average number of decayed missing and filled teeth (D3MFT) in twelve year old children in West Somerset (1.18), Sedgemoor (0.99) and Taunton Deane (0.92) was higher than the national average Mean D3MF T in twelve year old children by Primary Care Trust (NDEP 2010) 72 Figure 40: Mean D3MFT by Lower Tier Local Authority in twelve year old children (NDEP 2010) 1.18 D3MFT Local Authority 73 Prevalence of early childhood caries in three year olds For the first time data was collected that allowed for investigation into a specific type of caries called early childhood caries (ECC). This is an aggressive form of decay that affects upper incisors and can be rapid and extensive in attack. It is associated with long term bottle use with sugar -sweetened drinks, especiall y when these are given overnight or for long periods of the day. The definition of ECC used here is: \"Caries affecting any surface of one or more upper primary incisors, regardless of the caries status o f any other teeth (Davies et Tier LA Figure 41: Percentage of three year olds with early childhood caries (ECC) by Upper Tier Local Authority (NDEP 2014 ) 74 Analysis shows how the percentage of three year old children with ECC was higher than the national average of 3.9% in Bristol (5.7%) and Torbay (5.2). Disease burden in those five year old children who have decay The average d3mft for the whole sampled population can be compared over time and is an important statistical indicator; however, it does not clearly ide ntify the disease burden in those children who already have decay. A greater understanding about the extent of disease in the mouths of children affected can be obtained by calculating the average number of decayed, missing or filled teeth in this group w ith decay. This is referred to as d3mft>0. A child aged five normally has 20 primary teeth. In England for those children with decay experience, the average number of decayed, missing (due to decay) or filled teeth is 3.38. Across the South West, two loca l authority areas have higher values than this. These are Cornwall (3.66) and Swindon (3.39). 3.66 3.39 3.38 3.32 3.12 3.10 3.03 3.00 2.87 2.87 2.63 2.60 2.45 2.00 1.88 0.000.501.001.502.002.503.003.504.004.505.00Mean d3mft (%d3mft>0) Upper Tier Local Authority Figure 42: Average number of dentinally decayed, missing (due to decay) and filled teeth (d3mft) among five year old children with d ecay experience (d3mft>0) by Upper Tier Local Authority (NDEP 2013) 75 Those children in West Somerset and Sedgemoor, who have decay, have a higher level of decay than the England average (3.38).

At a lower tier level, data demon strate that generally, the burden of disease in those children who have decay in West Somerset (2.6), Sedgemoor (2.51) and Taunton Deane (2.27) is worse than the national average (2.21). 2.67 2.32 2.28 2.27 2.24 2.21 number of missing (due to decay) and filled teeth (D3MFT) among twelve year old children with decay experience (D3MFT>0) by Primary Care Trust (NDEP 2010) Figure 45: Average number of dentinally decayed, missing (due to decay) and filled teeth (D3MFT) among twelve year old children with deca y experience (D3MFT>0) by Lower Tier Local Authority (NDEP 2010) 2.60 2.51 2.21 2.19 South SomersetMean D3MFT (%D3MFT>0) Local Authority 77 Dental treatment received by five year olds The care index The care index is the proportion of teeth with caries that have been filled. It gives an indication of the restorative care received by children with decay, by dentists. It is derived by taking the number of filled teeth and dividing by the total number of dentinally decayed, missing and filled teeth and converting to a percentage (ft/d3mft). In using this care index data, care should be taken in making assumptions about the extent or the quality of clinical care available. The higher the care index the more fillings have been undertaken. The care index was 11.2% across England as a whole, showing that just over a tenth of decayed teeth are treated by filling them. This index varied between 16.4% in Devon to 5.7% in Gloucestershire. There is considerable variation within the re gion. The values for Plymouth (11%); Bristol (10.2%); Cornwall (9%); Bath and North East Somerset (8.9); Wiltshire (6.4%) and Gloucestershire (5.7%) are below the national average which suggests that children in these areas may not necessarily be gaining t he appropriate access and/or dental treatment that is required. 78 *Note: data from Isles of Scilly is not included At lower tier authority level, local data suggest that in Sedgemoor (9.7%) and South Somerset (6.9%), the care index for five year olds is below the England (11.2%) indicating that children in this locality may not be gaining the appropriate access and/or dental treatment that is Authority Figure 46: Care index among five year old children by Upper Tier Local Authority Area (NDEP 2013) Figure 47: Care index among five year old children by Lower Tier Local Authority Area (NDEP 2013) Care Index Sedgemoor South Somerset Local Authority 79 Dental treatment received by twelve olds The care index The care index trends are similar in twelve year olds. Across the South West, the values for South Gloucestershire (41.8%); Bristol (41.8%); Swindon (41.3%); Bath and North East Somerset (37.4%) and Wiltshire (28.6%) are all below the national average (47.2%) indicating that children in this locality may not be gaining the appropriate access and/or dental treatment that is required. Local data demo nstrate that in West Somerset (38.5%), the Care Index value is below the national average (47.2%) indicating that children in this locality may not be gaining the appropriate access and/or dental treatment that is among twelve year old children by PCT (NDEP 2010) 80 Figure 49: Care index among twelve year old children by Lower Tier Local Authority ( NDEP West West Somerset Local Authority 81 Dental extractions due to decay in five year olds The care index alone can only give a limited picture of treatment as it is dependent on access to care. The care index is thus solely a measure of restoration of teeth. Where multiple teeth are decayed in five year olds, extraction of teeth may be required (possibly under general anaesthetic). The proportion of five year old children who had one or more teeth e xtracted on one or more occasions across England was 3.1%. Across the South West, the equivalent values for Plymouth (4.3%) and Bristol (3.5%) were above the national average. Figure 50: Percentage of five year old children with one or more teeth extracted due to dental decay (%Mt >0) by Upper Tier Local Tier Local Authority 82 Local data demonstrate how across this area, although all local authorities show lower values than the nation al average (3.1%), in West Somerset (2.7%); Taunton Deane (2.4%) and South Somerset (2.3%), these proportions are above the average for the South West (2.2%). Figure 51: Percentage of five year old children with one or more teeth extracted due to dental decay (%Mt >0) by Lower Tier Local Sedgemoor%Mt> 0 Local Authority 83 Three year old children with sepsis at the time of the examination Among three year olds, virtually all sepsis will be the result of the dental decay process rather than originating from gum problems. Sepsis was defined in the protocol as the presence of a dental abscess or sinus recorded by visual examination of the soft tissues. Untreated caries can give rise to infection of the tooth pulp, which can spread to the supporting tissues and the jaws, culminating in advanced disease conditions that are often painful. The impact of such acute conditions are substantial, and re search suggests that poor oral health in children is associated with being underweight and a failure to thrive (Sheiham 2006). Across England 0.4% of three year old children showed signs of sepsis and, as expected, the level was generally higher in those a reas where there were higher levels of decay. For example, the highest levels occurred in Bristol (1%) and Somerset (0 .8%), above the England average Tier LA Figure 52: Percentage of t hree year old children with sepsis at the time of the examination by Upper Tier Local Authority Area (NDEP 2014 ) 84 Five year old children with sepsis at th e time of the examination Among five year olds nearly all sepsis will be the result of the dental decay process rather than originating from gum problems. Across England 1.7% of five year old children showed signs of sepsis. In the South West, there is significant variation with the highest levels in Cornwall (6.2%) and the lowest in the Isles of Scilly; North 53: Percentage of five year old children with evidence of sepsis by Upper Tier Local Authority Area (NDEP 2013) 85 Local data show how the percentage of children with obvious abscess/sepsis was higher than the national average (1.7%) in West Somerset (3.2%) and Sedgemoor (3.1%). The implications are serious as such teeth will often require extraction, usually under a general anaesthesia, exposing children to unnecessary risk of complications. This is a serious health issue which can, and should be prevented. Figure 54: Percentage of five year old children with evidence of sepsis by Lower Tier Local Authority Area (NDEP 2013) Lower Tier Deane% Abcess/Sepsis 86 Hospital admissions for dental extractions in children and young people (0 -19 years) Data have also been extrapolated from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) dataset which records inpatient care from National Health Service (NHS) hospitals across England. This database provides details about admission of children and young people (0-19 years) to hospital for extraction of one or more decayed primary or permanent teeth. No assumptions can be made about the method of anaesthesia provided for these procedures but it is likely that the majority of episodes involved general anaesthetic. The v ast majority of teeth extracted will have been removed because of decay, a minority for other reasons such as orthodontics. In 2012/13, 6415 children and young people across the South West had teeth extracted under a general anaesthetic due to dental deca y, and the most common age was 5 -9 years. Such procedures expose children to small, but significant risks of life -threatening complications (Royal College of Anaesthetists 2008) for an essentially, entirely preventable disease. Figure 55 shows the variation in hospita l admissions for dental extractions by government office region. This variation reflects a combination of differing levels of dental disease, local service provision and data collection but may not capture all dental extractions including extractions carri ed out by community dental services on a sessional basis. This probably means that these figures are an underestimation.

Within DCIoS, the oral health of three year olds is generally poorer in Torbay than national averages. Both dental decay prevalence, and the average number of teeth per child affected by decay (decayed, missing or filled teeth) was higher th an the England average, in Torbay. Early childhood caries is an aggressive form of decay that affects upper front teeth, and can be rapid and extensive in attack. It is associated with long term bottle use with sugar -sweetened drinks, especially when these are given overnight or for long periods of the day. Analysis shows how the percentage of three year old children with ECC was higher than the national average of 3.9% in Torbay (5.2). Five year olds Both dental decay prevalence, and the average number of teeth per child affected by decay are higher than the England average in Torbay, and at lower tier level, in North Devon. When 2008/09 and 2011/12 survey data are compared for DCIoS, these are the only two local authorities where the percentage of five yea r old children with decay experience has increased over this time. Mid Devon and Cornwall have seen the greatest reduction in the percentage of children with decay experience. There is an underlying trend of worse decay in those children who have any decay . If only those children who already have decay are considered, and the number of decayed teeth are measured, then it is possible to ascertain this burden of disease. It appears that those children in Cornwall, and at a lower tier level, Torridge and North Devon, who have decay, have a higher level of decay than the England average. This suggests that a small number of children experience most decay. Children who have on average 3 to 4 decayed teeth are more likely to be living in deprivation, and are le ss likely to access dental services. When they do access services they may not receive definitive treatment. In terms of acute disease, the percentage of children with obvious oral abscess/sepsis in Cornwall (6.2%) and Torbay (2.73%) were above the nationa l average. At a lower tier level, the percentage of children with obvious abscess/sepsis was higher than the national average in the South Hams (2.1%). 90 Untreated caries can give rise to infection of the tooth pulp, which can spread to the supporting tissue s and the jaws, culminating in advanced disease conditions that are often painful. The impact of such acute conditions are substantial, and research suggests that poor oral health in children is associated with being underweight and a failure to thrive. Th e implications are serious as such teeth will often require extraction, usually under a general anaesthesia, exposing children to small, but significant risks of life -threatening complications, for an essentially, entirely preventable disease. In Torbay (1 .1%) and Devon (0.8%), the number of children and adolescent hospital admissions, as a percentage of the population, for a dental extraction, is higher than the England average of 0.5%. At lower tier local authority level, the equivalent percentages were a bove the national average in North Devon (1.2%); Exeter Teignbridge (0.7%). The most common age for admission was 5 -9 years in all of these local authorities, except for Torridge where it was in t he 10 -14 age group. In North Devon (2.3%) and Exeter (2.2%), and mid Devon (1.7%), these percentages were substantially higher than the national average for that age group (0.8%). This dataset does not include those extractions carried out by community den tal services, which thus means the figures are likely to be an underestimation. Twelve year olds In DCIoS, the oral health of twelve year olds is generally poorer than national averages. The prevalence of decay was higher than the national average (33.4%) in Torbay (44.3%); Devon (36.5%) and Plymouth (34.7%). At lower tier authority level, the prevalence of dental decay in twelve year olds was higher than the national average in Teignbridge (45.6%), West Devon (38.7%), Exeter (38.5%), Devon (35.7%) and Torridge (33.7%). In terms of severity of decay, in Torbay (0.97); Plymouth (0.81) and Devon (0.77) the average number of teeth per child affected by decay was above the national average of 0.74. At lower tier level, in Teignbridge (1.06); Exeter Hams Devon (0.74) the average number of teeth per child affected by decay was higher than the national average of (0.74). Those children in Plymouth; Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly; and at a lower tier level, Teignbridge, who have decay, have a higher level of decay than the England average (2.21). 91 Sample information: Survey of three year olds (NDEP 2014) Details of the sample from Devon, Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Are a Team boundaries are detailed below at Upper and Lower Tier Local Authority level.

As there were only 23 five year old children on the Isles of Scilly, 10 were approached to take part in the survey, and of those 7 children were examined. The survey coordinators was considered this data to representative of the small population of 23 five year 93 olds children, and thus the the data have been included because 70% of the sample, and 30% of the population have been examined.

It is therefore possible to directly compare the results from these surveys. The response rates were similar in both years at 66.8% in 2008, and 65.2% in 2012. It is possible that there is still some bias, and in making comparisons reference should be made to the response levels, particularly when the sample sizes are small. 96 In the majority of local authorities in Devon and Cornwall the percentage of five year old children with decay experience has decreased when data between the two surveys is compared. Decreases in prevalence are seen in all local authorities except Torbay and North Devon. Data was not available from 2007/08 for Isles of Scilly, Teignbridge, South Hans, West Devon and Torridge, therefore trends for these local authorities cannot be assessed. Mid Devon and Cornwall have seen the greatest reduction in the percentage of children with decay experience. 2007/08 2011/12 Figure 56: Percentage of 5 year old children 97 Prevalence of dental decay at age three The proportion of the population who have decay experience is used as a proxy for prevalence. The survey on three year olds does provide data to lower tier local authority, level but these are likely to have limited practical value. Sample numbers are very small, and confidence intervals wide. For this reason, the data only presented at Upper Tier Local Authority level. Across England, 11.7% of three year old children had experience of obvious dental decay, having one or more teeth that w ere decayed to dentinal level, extracted or filled because of caries (%d3mft>0). The remaining 88% were free from visually obvious dental decay. Across the Area Team boundaries, dental decay prevalence was higher than the England average in Bristol Figure 57: Percentage of three year old children with decay experience (d3mft>0) including incisors by Upper Tier Local Authority A rea (NDEP 2014 ) 98 Prevalence of dental decay at age five The 2011/2012 data for the prevalence of dental decay across the South West, in five year olds, ranged from 35.7% in Torbay to 14.3% in the Isles of Scilly.

Figure 66: Mean D3MFT by Lower Tier Local Authority in twelve year old children (NDEP 2010) 1.06 Authority 107 Prevalence of early childhood caries in three year olds For the first time data was collected that allowed f or investigation into a specific type of caries called early childhood caries (ECC). This is an aggressive form of decay that affects upper incisors and can be rapid and extensive in attack. It is associated with long term bottle use with sugar - sweetened d rinks, especially when these are given overnight or for long periods of the day. The definition of ECC used here is: \"Caries affecting any surface of one or more upper primary incisors, regardless of the caries status of any other teeth (Davies et al. 2010 ). Analysis shows how the percentage of three year old children with ECC was higher than the national average of 3.9% in Tier LA Figure 67: Percentage of three year olds with early childhood caries (ECC) by Upper Tier Local Authority (NDEP 2014 ) 108 Disease burden in those five year old children who have decay The average d3mft for the whole sampled population can be compared over time and is an important statistical indicator; however, it does not clearly identify the disease burden in those children who already have decay. A greater understanding about the ex tent of disease in the mouths of children affected can be obtained by calculating the average number of decayed, missing or filled teeth in this group with decay. This is referred to as d3mft>0. A child aged five normally has 20 primary teeth. In England f or those children with decay experience, the average number of decayed, missing (due to decay) or filled teeth is 3.38. Across the South West, two local authority areas have higher values than this. These are Cornwall (3.66) and Swindon (3.39). 3.66 3.39 3.38 3.32 3.12 3.10 3.03 3.00 2.87 2.87 2.63 2.60 2.45 2.00 1.88 0.000.501.001.502.002.503.003.504.004.505.00Mean d3mft (%d3mft>0) Upper Tier Local Authority Figure 68: Average number of dentinally decayed, missing (due to decay) and filled teeth (d3mft) among five year old children with decay experience (d3mft>0) by Upper Tier Local Authority (NDEP 2013) 109 Those children in Torridge (3.45) and North Devon (3.38), who have decay, have a higher level of decay than the England average (3.38).

It gives an indication of the restorative care received by children with decay, by dentists. It is derived by taking the number of filled teeth and dividing by the total number of dentinally decayed, missing and filled teeth and converting to a percentage (ft/d3mft). In using this care index data, care should be taken in making assumptions about the extent or the quality of clinical care available. The higher the care index the mor e fillings have been undertaken. The care index was 11.2% across England as a whole, showing that just over a tenth of decayed teeth are treated by filling them. This index varied between 16.4% in Devon to 5.7% in Gloucestershire. There is considerable variation within the region. The values for Plymouth (11%); Bristol (10.2%); Cornwall (9%); Bath and Wi ltshire (6.4%) and Gloucestershire (5.7%) are below the national average which suggests that children in these areas may not necessarily be gaining the appropriate access and/or dental treatment that is Authority Figure 72: Care index among five year old children by Upper Tier Local Authority Area (NDEP 2013) Care Index 113 *Note: data from Isles of Scilly is not included At lower tier authority level, local data suggest that in East Devon and North Devon (4.8%), the care inde x for five year olds is below the England (11.2%) indicating that children in this locality may not be gaining the appropriate access and/or dental treatment that is required. Figure 73: Care index among five year old children by Lower Tier Local Authority Area 114 Dental treatment received by twelve olds The care index The care index trend s are similar in twelve year olds. Across the South West, the values for South Gloucestershire (41.8%); Bristol (41.8%); Swindon (41.3%); Bath and North East Somerset (37.4%) and Wiltshire (28.6%) are all below the national average (47.2%) indicating that children in this locality may not be gaining the appropriate access and/or dental treatment that is among twelve year old children by PCT (NDEP 2010) 115 Local data demonstrate that in Teignbridge (45.6%); Exeter (41.3%) and North Devon (39.3%), the Care Index value is below the national average (47.2%) indicating that children in this locality may not be gaining the appropriate access and/or dental treatment that is required. Figure 75: Care index among twelve year old children by Lower Tier Local Authority Dental extractions due to decay in five year olds The care index alone can only give a limited picture of treatment as it is dependent on access to care. The care index is thus solely a measure of restoration of teeth. Where multiple teeth are decayed in five year olds, extraction of teeth may be required (possibly under general anaesthetic). The proportion of five year old children who had one or more teeth extracted on one or more occasions across England was 3.1%. Across the South West, the equivalent values for Plymouth (4.3%) and Bristol (3.5%) were above Local Authority Figure 76: Percentage of five year old children with one or more teeth extracted due to dental decay (%Mt >0) by Upper Tier Local Authority Area (NDEP 2013) 117 Local data demonstrate how across this area, although all local authorities show lower values than the national average (3.1%), in Mid Devon, T orridge, and Exeter, these proportions are above the average for the South West (2.2%). Figure 77: Percentage of five year old child ren with one or more teeth extracted due to dental decay (%Mt >0) by Lower Tier Local year old children with sepsis at the time of the examination Among three year olds, virtually all sepsis will be the result of the dental decay process rather than originating from gum problems. Sepsis was defined in the protocol as the pres ence of a dental abscess or sinus recorded by visual examination of the soft tissues. Untreated caries can give rise to infection of the tooth pulp, which can spread to the supporting tissues and the jaws, culminating in advanced disease conditions that ar e often painful. The impact of such acute conditions are substantial, and research suggests that poor oral health in children is associated with being underweight and a failure to thrive (Sheiham 2006). Across England 0.4% of three year old children showed signs of sepsis and, as expected, the level was generally higher in those areas where there were higher levels of decay. For example, the highest levels occurred in Bristol (1%) and Somerset (0.8%), above the England average. Tier LA Figure 78: Percentage of t hree year old children with sepsis at the time of the examination by Upper Tier Local Authority Area (NDEP 2014 ) 119 Five year old children with sepsis at the time of the examination Among five year olds nearly all sepsis will be the result of the dental decay process rather than originating from gum problems. Across England 1.7% of five year old children showed signs of sepsis. In the South West, there is significant variation with the highest levels in Cornwall (6.2%) and the lowest in the Isles of Scilly; North Somerset; Plymouth and South Gloucestershire (0%). Local data show how the percentage of children with obvious abscess/sepsis was higher than the national average (1. 7%) in the South Hams (2.1%). The implications are serious as such teeth will often require extraction, usually under a general anaesthesia, exposing children to unnecessary risk of complications. This is a serious health issue which can, and should be pre 79: Percentage of five year old children with evidence of sepsis by Upper Tier Local Authority Area (NDEP 2013) 120 Figure 80: Percentage of five year old children with evidence of sepsis by Lower Tier Local Authority Area (NDEP 2013) Lower Tier dental extractions in children and young people (0 -19 years) Data have also been extrapolated from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) dataset which records inpatient care from National Health Service (NHS) hospitals across England. This database provides details about admission of ch ildren and young people (0 -19 years) to hospital for extraction of one or more decayed primary or permanent teeth. No assumptions can be made about the method of anaesthesia provided for these procedures but it is likely that the majority of episodes invol ved general anaesthetic. The vast majority of teeth extracted will have been removed because of decay, a minority for other reasons such as orthodontics. In 2012/13, 6415 children and young people across the South West had teeth extracted under a general anaesthetic due to dental decay, and the most common age was 5 -9 years. Such procedures expose children to small, but significant risks of life -threatening complications (Royal College of Anaesthetists 2008) for an essentially, entirely preventable disease . Figure 81 shows the variation in hospital admissions for dental extractions by government office region. This variation reflects a combination of differing levels of dental disease, local service provision and data collection but may not capture all dental extractions including extractions carried out by community dental services on a sessional basis. This probably means that these figures are an underestimation. 122 Figure 81: Number of children admitted to hospital for extractio n of decayed teeth in 2012 /13, including the percentage of the population aged 0 to 19 years, by Government Office Region (N DEP 2014) 123 Local data, by former PCT of residence, demonstrate ho w Torbay (1.1%) and Devon (0.8%), the number of children and adolescent admissions, as a percentage of the population is higher than the England average of 0.5%.

However, for those who do have decay or gum problems, disease can be extensive, whilst for many people in old age and older middle age, dental needs are very complex. M arked inequalities in oral health also persist according to socio -economic status In terms of loss of teeth, tooth decay, periodontal diseases and tooth wear, the oral health of adults in the South West SHA is poorer than the national averages: - 83% of adul ts in the South West had 21 or more natural teeth, below the national average of 86% - The prevalence of coronal caries (tooth decay in the crown of the tooth) in the South West was 34%, above the national average of 29% - 7% of adults in England, and 11% in the South West area had active decay on one or more root surface - Pocketing depth gives an indication of the severity of periodontal disease. 59% of dentate adults in the South West had evidence of pocketing of 4mm or more (well above the national average o f 45%). Compared to national averages, there is a higher prevalence of more severe disease, with 11% having pocketing over 6mm (above the national average of 9%), and 2% having severe pocketing of 9mm or more (above the national average of 1%). Note that this is likely to be an underestimation due to lack of robust prevalence data - In the South West, 82% of dentate adults showed signs of any wear, above the national average of 77%. In line with national trends, severe wear in the South West remains rare (2% ). Nationally there are increasing proportions of younger adults with moderate wear which is likely to be clinically relevant, as it is indicative of rapid tooth wear, and treatment may be required 126 The oral health of adults Information regarding the ora l health of adults has been collected nationally and decennially through Office National Statistics co -ordinated socio -dental surveys, based on an interview schedule and a dental examination performed by trained and calibrated dental examiners. The result s of the most recent national adult dental health survey in 2009 were released in 2011, and have reported data at a regional, Strategic Health Authority (SHA), level. The results of the survey show that across almost all of the indicators of oral health an d disease there has been a continued improvement in adults' dental health. The continuation of improvement in younger age groups, first detected over 20 years ago, are now evident up to age 45. However, for those who do have decay or gum problems, disease can be extensive, whilst for many people in old age and older middle age, dental needs are very complex. Marked inequalities in oral health also persist, according to socio -economic status. Number of teeth In the 2009 national survey only 6% of adults in England were found to be edentate (have no teeth), which mirrors the regional picture in the South West (6%). Edentulousness was found to increase with age, and vary by gender (4% male, female 7%). The overa ll trend with regard to edentulousness is clear with the proportion of edentate adults falling by 22 percentage points from 28% in 1978 to 6% in 2009. The presence of 21 or more natural teeth has been used as an additional marker of the health of the population's teeth. In the national 2009 survey 86% of adults in England had 21 or more teeth, with only 83% in the South West. Figure 82: Trends in percentage edentate by age, England (1978 -2009) (HSCIC 2011) 127 Dental decay Coronal caries (decay in the crown of the tooth) Between 1998 and 2009, the prevalence of coronal caries (tooth decay in the crown of the tooth) in England has fallen from 46% to 29%, with reductions across all age groups, and the largest reduction (21 percentage points) in the 25 -34 age bands. In 2009, prevalence in the South West was 34%, above the national average. The proportion with dental decay varied by age with the 25 to 34 year group having the highest prevalence (36%) and the 65 -74 age group, t he lowest at 22%. Men were more likely than women to have coronal caries, as were those from socially deprived households. Root caries (decay in the root of the tooth) In normal, healthy mouths the root surfaces of teeth are covered by the gums, although t here may be some gum recession as part of the aging process. However as adults age, the cumulative effects of gum disease may cause the widespread exposure of root surfaces, and therefore with age the prevalence of root caries is likely to increase. 7% of adults in England, and 11% in the South West area had active decay on one or more root surface, the proportion increasing with age (20% in 75-84 years), being male, and social deprivation. Periodontal health Nationally, since 1998, there has been an overal l reduction in the prevalence of pocketing at 4mm or more from 55%, down to 45% signifying an overall reduction in mild disease, associated, perhaps, with a general increase in oral hygiene. This was apparent in almost all age categories. However, there ha s been a slight increase in the prevalence of more severe disease and the impacts of severe disease are concentrated in a relatively small proportion of the population: for both higher thresholds (pockets of 6mm or more, and 9mm or more) no decline in prev alence was observed between 1998 and 2009, in fact for pocketing at 6mm an overall increase from 6 per cent to 9 per cent in 2009 was observed. In 2009, 59% of dentate adults in the South West had evidence of pocketing of 4mm or more (well above the nation al average of 45%), with 11% having pocketing over 6mm (above the national average of 9%) and 2% in the South West having severe pocketing of 9mm or more (above the national average of 1%). Tooth wear Tooth wear involves tooth surface loss other than that from tooth decay and includes erosion, attrition and abrasion. Typically these processes may occur together with the overall result loss of tooth tissue with a change in the shape and form of the 128 tooth. Wear is a natural process but where it is rapid and destructive, treatment may be required. The prevalence of tooth wear in England has increased since the 1998 survey, when two thirds (66%) of the dentate population showed signs of wear, compared with over three quarters (77%) in the 2009 survey. There hav e also been small increases in the proportion of adults with moderate wear, 11% in 1998 compared with 15% in 2009. While the increase in moderate tooth wear is small, the moderate tooth wear in 16 to 34 year olds is of clinical relevance as it is suggestiv e of rapid tooth wear. In the South West, 82% of dentate adults showed signs of any wear, above the national average of 77%. In line with national trends, severe wear in the South West remains rare (2%). But there are increasing proportions of younger adul ts, nationally, with moderate wear which is likely to be clinically relevant as it is indicative of rapid tooth wear. 129 Oral cancer Key Points Age standardised incidence and mortality rates per 100,000 population within each local authority, at upper and lower tier level are summarised below: BGSW Lower tier Highest incidence rate in Cheltenham and lowest incidence rate in Stroud Highest mortality rate in Cheltenham and lowest mortality rate in Cotswold Upper tier Highest incidence rate in Gloucestershire and lowest incidence rate in BANES Highest mortality rate in Wiltshire and lowest mortality rate in Swindon BNSSSG Lower tier Highest incidence rate in West Somerset and lowest incidence rate in South Somerset Highest mortality rate in West Somerset and lowest mortality rate in South Somerset Upper tier Highest incidence rate in South Gloucestershire and lowest incidence rate in North Somerset Highest mortality rate in Somerset and lowest mortality rat e in South Gloucestershire 130 DCIoS Lower tier Highest incidence rate in West Devon and lowest incidence rate in South Hams Highest mortality rate in Exeter and lowest mortality rate in South Hams Upper tier Highest incidence rate in Plymouth and lowest incidence rate in Torbay Highest mortality rate in Cornwall and Isles of Scilly and lowest mortality rate in Torbay Oral cancer: Understanding the problem nationally Oral cancer is the 16th most common cancer in the UK (2011).

Around 6767 people (4 510 men and 2257 women) were diagnosed with oral cancer in 2011 in the UK, which is the equivalent of more than 18 people every day. This accounts for 2% of all cancer cases. Oral cancer incidence rates in the UK have risen by a third in the last decade. Changes in the prevalence of oral cancer risk factors such as alcohol consumption, tobacco use (smoking and smokeless), and human papilloma virus (HPV) infec tion are the most likely reasons this increase (IARC 2008; Parkin et al 2010; NCIN 2012). Cancer incidence increases with age, and in the UK the 50 -74 age group contributes around 7 in 10 male oral cancer cases, and around 6 in 10 female cases. However , in the UK, oral cancer cases are increasingly being seen in younger and middle age groups. Similar trends in other parts of the world have been attributed to increasing rates of HPV infection (Shiboski et al 2005; Golas et al 2007; Patel et al 2011; Anne rtz et al 2012), reflecting a strong association with sexual behaviours (Chaturvedi 2012; Rautava and Syrj\u00e4nen 2012). Oral cancer generally carries a poor prognosis, and it is the most costly cancer to treat (Glick et al 2012). Early diagnosis substantiall y increases survival rates of this type of cancer, thus regular visits to a dentist are crucial for screening for early signs of oral cancer, and in highlighting mouth cancer risk factors. Around half of patients diagnosed with cancer of the oral cavity wi ll survive their disease for at least five years, and approximately half of patients diagnosed with cancer of the tongue will survive their disease for at least five years. Oral cancer mortality rates have increased by around 10% in the last decade. Approx imately 2,100 people died of oral cancer in 2012 in the UK, roughly 6 people every day (Cancer Research UK 2014). 131 Within this analysis ICD and defined as oral cancer.

Generally, the more deprived the area, the higher the rate of decay: In BGSW , decay prevalence in five ye ar olds is highest in Forest of Dean, Gloucester and Swindon, where deprivation is high. The same is true for twelve year olds in Wiltshire, Gloucester and Forest of Dean In BNSSSG, decay prevalence in five year olds is highest in Sedgemoor, North and West Somerset and Bristol. The same is true for twelve year olds in West Somerset, Taunton Deane and Bristol In DCIoS, decay prevalence in five year olds is highest in Torbay, North Devon and Exeter. The same is true for twelve year olds in Teignbridge, Torba y and West Devon National surveys demonstrate socio -economic variations in the oral health of adults, with individuals from routine and manual occupation households being more likely to have dental decay and periodontal diseases than those from managerial and professional occupational households. The risks of developing oral cancer are higher in those of low socioeconomic status, and more than double for men in such groups. In the South West, oral cancer age standardised incidence varies according to depri vation quintile, with higher incidence occurring in the most deprived population groups. In terms of age standardised mortality, generally the oral cancer mortality increases at higher deprivation quintiles. 2009 Adult Survey data demonstrate a very clear gradient in oral health related quality of life according to socio -economic position, with lower socioeconomic groups reporting more prevalent and more severe impacts upon their quality of life. This implies that some sections in the adult dentate populati on may be disadvantaged in terms of their oral health, resulting in a considerable negative impact on their quality of life 140 Dental decay and deprivation It is well accepted that people living in deprived communities consistently have poorer levels of oral health than people living in richer communities (Marmot and Bell 2011). Dental decay is now becoming a disease of deprivation (Do 2012), because the greatest burden exists in disadvantaged and poor populations. A recent study has highlighted the utilit y of the IMD score to be used as a readily available tool which can be used where dental caries data are not available. The study showed how the total 2010 IMD score explained 60% of variance in dental caries. It thus has the potential to be used as an ind icator for the targeting of oral health improvement programmes (Broomhead et al 2014). Recently in the UK, associations have been found with the Index of Multiple Deprivation in England and Scotland (McGrady et al 2012). The analysis below demonstrates tha t there are profound inequalities in dental decay status in children and adults as evidenced by local, regional and national surveys. Note that figures depicting national level analysis are 'ecological' area analysis , rather than analysis of individual s deprivation versus dental status. Dental decay in three year old children National trends The variation in dental decay reported at the lower tier local authority level has some correlation with the index of multiple deprivation, with the highest levels of disease tending to be seen in the most deprived areas. However, analysis shows a weaker association between levels of decay and deprivation, when compared with the data from the five year old child survey, with greater scatter and only 19% of the prevalenc e bein g explained by deprivation (Figure 87 ). 141 Figure 87: Correlation between proportion of three -year-old children with caries experience and ind ex of multiple deprivation (IMD 2010) score. Lower -tier local authorities in England, 2013 (NDEP 2014) 142 Dental decay in five year old children National trends National lower tier local authority level data from the 2013 survey on five year olds demonstrates how the severity of dental decay is well correlated with deprivation; the more deprived the area, the higher the rate of decay found in the five year olds surveyed. 44% of the variation in decay levels in local authorities being explained by diffe rences in deprivation (Figure 88 ).

Epidemiological studies have established a significant relationship between socioeconomic status an d periodontal disease in various age groups, demonstrating how poor periodontal disease status is linked to low income and low educational attainment (Boillot 1999). National data on the oral h ealth status in adults reveals that a greater proportion of dentate adults from managerial and professional occupation households (21%) had very healthy periodontal tissues compared with adults from intermediate occupation (16%) and routine and manual occu pation households (12%). The national average was 17%. Oral cancer and deprivation As with dental decay and periodontal disease, there is a marked association between oral cancer and socioeconomic status. Incidence rates for head and neck cancer in England (ICD- 10 C00 -C14, C30 -C32) are around 130% higher (more than double) for men living in more deprived areas compared with the least deprived, and more than 74% higher for women (NCIN 2008). The risks of developing oral cancer are higher in those of low soc ioeconomic status, 149 even after taking risk factors like tobacco use and alcohol use into account (Warnakulasuriya 2009; Conway et al 2008). Across the South West, it is evident from Table 27 and Figure 95 that oral cancer incidence varies according to depri vation quintile, with higher incidence occurring in the most deprived population groups.

Poor oral health has a disproportionate impact on the quality of lives of older peo ple, compounded by socioeconomic and psychological factors. The resulting pain, discomfort, difficulties in eating, and sleepless nights can lead to increased agitation, anxiety, confusion, malnutrition and dehydration. Poor oral health can reduce self - esteem, adding to the problems of loneliness and isolation in a population already on the margins of society. Age related changes can lead to dry mouth (often drug related), root decay, recurrent decay and decreased manual dexterity can lead to reduced plaque control Chronic long -term conditions such as diabetes and Alzheimer's disease increase the risk of developing periodontal diseases leading to tooth loss and loss of oral function Systemic problems can also have an effect on oral health, for example, many older people suffer from progressive neurocognitive impairing illnesses like Parkinson's disease, which can cause difficulties in controlling and retaining dentures Older people in residential and nursing care generally have poorer oral health than the gen eral population. There are no local data on the oral health needs of this population group Adults living with dementia may experience additional difficulties in maintaining good oral hygiene, and may be reliant on their carers to undertake routine oral hyg iene for them. There are problems around the inconsistent delivery of oral health care by care home providers. Not all care homes include oral health care as part of their care plans, and there is a lack of staff training in the provision of personal oral care A group known as the \"heavy metal generation\" between 30 and 65 years who have experienced a lifetime of high levels of disease, which has been treated by fillings, and other complex restorations such as crowns, will have challenging needs as they age. This has important service implications for the future, related to the continued maintenance and advanced restorative care amongst a group of adults who are likely to be increasingly frail, and with perhaps complex medical history and difficulties acce ssing dental services. Preventing oral disease is thus of crucial importance, as the burden of the disease lasts a lifetime. Once the tooth structure is compromised, restoration and complex additional maintenance will be required throughout the life of th e affected tooth, even long after the disease has been eliminated 152 Oral health in older people Local oral health data on older adults are not routinely collected. The 2009 Adult Dental Health Survey presents certain data at a national and regional level. Th e key findings in relation to older people are summarised below in terms of tooth loss, tooth decay, periodontal disease and acute conditions. Tooth loss There was a strong relationship between increasing age and total tooth loss; less than 0.5% of adults aged 25 to 34 years were edentate compared with 5% of 55 to 64 year olds and 47% adults over 85. 94% of adults across England, Wales and Northern Ireland had some natural teeth compared to only 87% in 1998. In 2009, 67% of adults aged over 75 have some na tural teeth. Tooth decay Just under one third (31%) of adults had obvious decay (dental caries on crowns or roots), with 40% of those aged between 75 and 84 years. In normal healthy mouths the root surfaces of teeth are covered by the gums, although there may be some gum recession as part of the aging process. However as adults age the accumulated effects of gum disease may cause the widespread exposure of root surfaces, and therefore with age the prevalence of root caries is likely to increase. Seven per cent of adults had active root decay and this proportion varied by age, with 1% of 16 to 24 year olds affected compared with 11% of 55 to 64 year olds, and 20% of 75 to 84 year olds Overall, 8 per cent of dentate adults had one or more untreated teeth wi th extensive, unrestorable decay. Prevalence varied between age groups whereby 15% of adults aged 75 to 84 had one or more teeth with extensive, unrestorable decay, compared with 6% of adults aged 16 to 24 years old. The complex restorative needs of older people In a review of NHS dentistry Professor Jimmy Steele (Steele et al. 2009) described three distinct cohorts within the adult population. Older age groups (those past retirement) are dominated by those with no teeth at all, that will need denture care for many years; a young generation under the age of 30 years who have lower levels of decay than their parents and have low restorative needs; and a group between 30 and 65 years who have experienced a lifetime of high levels of disease, which has been treated by fillings, and other complex restorations such as crowns: the 'heavy metal generation'. These trends are supported by findings in the 2009 adult dental health survey: In 2009, the majority (94%) of all adults in England were dentate. This varied w ith age from: - 99% of 45 -54 year olds 153 - 95% of 55 -64 year olds - 85% of 65 -74 year olds - 71% of 75 -84 year olds - 55% of 85 and over year olds Adults aged under 45 years were less likely to have any fillings, and those who did had relatively low numbers of filled teeth. By contrast, 97% of dentate adults aged 45 to 54 had a filled tooth 37% of dentate adults had artificial crowns. There was significant variation with age; only 5% of the 16 to 24 year olds had crowns, compared to between 55 and 59% of those aged 45 to 74. The \"heavy metal generation\" will have challenging needs as they age. This has important service implications for the future, related to the continued maintenance and advanced restorative care amongst a group of adults who are likely to be increasingly frail, and with perhaps complex medical history and difficulties accessing dental services. Gum disease Overall 54% of dentate adults had evide nce of mild to severe periodontal disease. The equivalent figure for the 65 -74 year old group was 77%, and 76% in the 75 -84 year old group. Acute disease Untreated tooth decay can lead to exposed tooth nerves, or an oral abscess or ulcer. Overall 7% of d entate adults had one or more of these lesions. The highest percentages were seen in the 75 -84 year old age group (8%) and 85 years and over (10%). Oral cancer Cancer incidence increases with age; one fifth of oral cancer cases diagnosed in the UK occur i n people aged 75 and over. This proportion is lower in males (15%) than females (29%). The 50 -74 age group contributes around 7 in 10 male oral cancer cases, and around 6 in 10 female cases. Almost three -quarters (74%) of oral cancer deaths in the UK in 20 12 were in people aged 60 and older (Cancer Research UK 2014). The impact of medical conditions on older people A number of vulnerable older people have medical conditions which limit their ability to maintain good oral hygiene, wear dentures; and complic ate the provision of dental care. These include those suffering from bleeding disorders such as haemophilia, patients with cardiovascular disease and individuals who are immune compromised (Davies and Bedi 2000). For these groups of patients, the preventio n of oral diseases will reduce the need for complex oral healthcare and help to safeguard general health. 154 Many older patients suffer from chronic long -term conditions such as diabetes and Alzheimer's disease which increase the risk of developing periodon tal diseases (Taylor 2010; Poole et al 2014), leading to tooth loss and loss of oral function. Reduced manual dexterity due to conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, may limit the ability of patients to adequately control oral hygiene, also increases thi s risk (Lewis et al. 2008). A range of medications decrease salivary flow, causing an uncomfortable, dry mouth, which makes denture -wearing more difficult and increases the risk of developing tooth decay and periodontal diseases. Medications such as calciu m channel blocking agents for cardiovascular problems are also linked to enlargement of gingival tissues (Hallmon and Rossmann 2000), making it more difficult to limit the build -up of plaque. Systemic problems can also have an effect on oral health, for example, many older people suffer from progressive neurocognitive impairing illnesses like Parkinson's disease, which can cause difficulties in controlling and retaining dentures. Impact on quality of life Poor oral health has a disproportionate impact on the lives of older people, compounded by socioeconomic and psychological factors (Petersen and Yamamoto 2005). The wide ranging health implications extend beyond the obvious acute symptoms of pain and discomfort in, and around, the mouth. Poor oral healt h can impact upon nutritional intake (through difficulties in eating, or restricted food choice), and disrupt routine sleep patterns. This in turn can affect quality of life, and general health as these individuals may experience subsequent increased agita tion, anxiety and confusion. These conditions have a major influence on the quality of life of older people. Increased life expectancy without enhanced quality of life is rapidly becoming a key public health issue: \"Good oral health is as much a matter of dignity as a health necessity\" (BDA 2012). Older people in residential and nursing care A recent Age UK report estimated that 3836 nursing homes and 10,445 residential homes provide care for around 431,500 elderly and disabled people, 414,000 of whom are over 65. Current general population risks of needing residential care are estimated to be 1% of adults aged 65 -74 years; 4% of adults aged 75 -84 years and approximately 16% of adults aged 85 years and over (Age UK 2014). A large provider of residential an d nursing care in the UK estimates the proportion of adults living with dementia in their establishments to be around 43% (Lievesley et al. 2012). Adults living with dementia may experience additional difficulties in maintaining good oral hygiene , and may be reliant on their carers to undertake routine oral hygiene for them. 155 Figure 97 and Table 29 below depicts the percentage of registered patients diagnosed with dementia, and respective numbers of persons with diagnosed dementia by upper tier local authority (QOF 2012/13). Table 29: Numbers of persons with diagnosed dementia Area 318,669 Figure 97: The percentage of registered p atients diagnosed with dementia (QOF 2012/13 ) 156 A recent BDA survey (2012) highlighted problems around the inconsistent delivery of oral health care by care home providers, the high level of unmet oral health needs for residents, the reluctance of staff to meet oral healt h needs, and lack of staff training. Interviews with frontline staff responsible for providing personal care demonstrated little or no understanding about the importance of oral health. Surveys in care homes in Wales and Glasgow confirmed similar findings. (Welsh Oral Health Information Unit 2008; Sweeney et al 2007).

This trend has major implications for both the general and oral health of older people (Harford 2009; Petersen and Ueda 2006). The risk of developing oral dise ase increases with age, as a consequence of lifelong exposure to risk factors.

However, no local oral epidemiological health data exists for these population groups. Un dertaking an oral health survey may be challenging, as there may be issues around obtaining a representative sample. It might not be absolutely necessary to define precisely the clinical dental needs of these groups as it is generally known that they have poorer health and oral health than the general public, so some form of proxy or extrapolation of work from elsewhere might be appropriate. There is a need to undertake ongoing work to identify prison -specific oral health and healthcare needs that take into account the views of service users. This information could subsequently inform commissioning decisions. It is imperative to integrate oral health into other general health improvement programmes using the common risk factor approach. Opportunities also ex ist to work with partner agencies towards the delivery of key oral health improvement messages by workers in contact with offenders in the community to make every contact count. Elements of oral health improvement can be embedded into rehabilitation progr ammes, specifically targeting this vulnerable population group. For example the 'Transforming Rehabilitation' reforms process or Youth Offender Services 169 Oral health of people in prison The health of people in prison is poorer than the general population, with poorer physical, mental and social health (Rose et al. 2012; Payne -James et al. 2010; DH 2003). In addition, drug, alcohol and tobacco dependency levels are high (WHO 2007). While not meeting the strict diagnostic criteria for a learning d isability, up to one quarter of the prison population are understood to have difficulties in communicating and/ or processing new or complex information (Mottram 2007). Prisoners over the age of 60 are the fastest growing age group in the prison estate acr oss England and Wales. Approximately 10% of the prison population are over the age of 50, and 80% of this group has a long standing illness or disability (RECOOP 2014). In terms of oral health, research demonstrates similar inequalities. The oral health status of inmates is poor, with higher levels of periodontal diseases and tooth decay (Bolin and Jones 2006; DH 2005), and also poor in comparison with non - institutionalised individuals (Walsh et al. 2008). Key risk factors associated with poor general he alth align closely with key risk factors associated with offending, and include family breakdown; low educational attainment; low self -esteem; substance misuse; unemployment and homelessness (The Marmot Review 2010; Farrington 2007). Poor oral health is cl osely associated with socio - economic deprivation, and a study in the North West of England have shown that oral health needs on admission are high, with levels of tooth decay nearly twice as high as the general population (Jones et al. 2005). This has bee n attributed to decay inducing diets, chaotic lifestyles, a lack of oral health education, and poor oral hygiene regimes; complicated by a higher incidence of learning difficulties and mental health problems in the prison population, alongside high risk be haviours such as drug and alcohol misuse and tobacco smoking (Heidari et al. 2007; DH 2003) Despite poorer levels of oral health in the prison population, evidence suggests that prisoners do not seek dental care often (Jones et al. 2005). Alongside this, it has been reported that dental service provision is insufficient to meet the needs of detainees (Bolin and Jones 2006) due to infrequent clinical sessions and poorly equipped clinical services. This problem is exacerbated by the increasing numbers of pe ople in prison, as well as the complex medical comorbidities and advanced restorative needs of the ageing prison population. Furthermore, the vast majority of custodial sentences issued by the courts are for short periods of imprisonment, thereby offering only a limited opportunity to engage with prison -based dental services. This can mean that courses of dental treatment are often disrupted or left incomplete (NAPDUK 2013). 170 The oral health of people in contact with the criminal justice system It is und erstood that people in contact with the criminal justice system also have multiple and complex health and social care needs. Although the research base on this population group is limited, and largely confined to county level studies, it suggests that prevalence levels across a range of disorders are comparable with those identified among the prison population, suggestive of a similar health profile across both groups (Revolving Doors agency 2013). It is thus more than likely that the burden of dental disea se is also high in people in contact with the criminal justice system. It is well recognised that poor engagement with mainstream community healthcare services leads to high usage of costly emergency services by this group (DH 2007). In a study of individ uals on the probation caseload in one trust area, 39% were found to have used Accident and Emergency services or NHS Walk -In clinics in the last 12 months. 9% had used these services three or more times in this period (Brooker 2008). Given this pattern of attendance behaviour for general healthcare services, it is likely that this population group access emergency dental services in the same way, only attending when in pain, as opposed to regular ( preventive ) check ups. Who is responsible for the health of people in contact with the criminal justice system? Commissioning responsibility for dental services in prisons transferred to NHS England in April 2013. It is important to note that NHS England Health and Justice teams only have responsibility for com missioning services within police custody, the courts, prisons and the secure estate. The proportion of offenders living in the community far outweighs those within the custodial estate. Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) have responsibility for commissi oning services for people in contact with the criminal justice system as members of the wider community. Directors of Public Health have specific duties to improve the health of this group as part of their remit to reduce health inequalities, working close ly with CCGs and Public Health England to understand and address the health needs of this population group. What can local authorities do address oral health inequalities among prisoners and people in contact with the criminal justice system? The new hea lth commissioning arrangements has created an important opportunity to respond to the health and oral health needs of the local population including those vulnerable population groups; prisoners and people in contact with the criminal justice system. Local authorities can be instrumental in delivering significant health improvements among this group. 171 Considerations include: Ensuring the inclusion of information on the specific oral health needs of prisoners, and those in contact with the criminal justice s ystem, in the Joint Strategic Needs Assessment process. However, no local oral epidemiological health data exists for these population groups. Undertaking an oral health survey may be challenging, as there may be issues around obtaining a representative sa mple. However, it might not be absolutely necessary to define precisely the clinical dental needs of these groups as it is generally known that they have poorer health and oral health than the general public, so some form of proxy or extrapolation of work from elsewhere might be appropriate. Undertaking ongoing work to identify prison -specific oral health and healthcare needs that consider the views of service users. This information could subsequently inform commissioning decisions. Integrating oral health into other general health improvement programmes using the common risk factor approach. Opportunities also exist to work with partner agencies towards the delivery of key oral health improvement messages by workers in contact with offenders in the communi ty to make every contact count. Embedding elements of oral health improvement into rehabilitation programmes, specifically targeting this vulnerable population group. The 'Transforming Rehabilitation' reforms process will support the rehabilitation of low and medium -risk prisoners in England and Wales within 21 new Community Rehabilitation Companies (Ministry of Justice 2014). The transitional period from the relatively stable environment of the prison setting back to often chaotic lifestyles in the commun ity, is particularly important as this is a period that has been linked to dramatically increased risks to health (Farrell and Marsden 2007; Pratt et al. 2006). Signposting at this stage could be vital to raise awareness of available local dental services for this group. 172 Vulnerable children and adults at risk of poor oral health Key points Children at risk of poor oral health include: Those living in areas of material and social deprivation Children with disabilities Looked after children and children at risk of neglect or abuse Adults from vulnerable groups are most at risk of poor oral health. They include: Adults living in areas of material and social deprivation People who have a learning disability People with mental illness People in long term institutional care, including residential care, psychiatric hospitals and prisons Homeless people The travelling community There is no local data available about the oral health status, needs and service usage of these groups in the population. However a review of the literature suggests that they are likely to have poorer oral health than the rest of the population; have more difficulty accessing dental care; and have worst health outcomes than the general population. Certainly the association between or al health and deprivation is well established, and these population groups will include some of the most deprived individuals in society. Barriers to care The barriers to oral health that these population groups experience will vary by age, personal environment and circumstances, and the level of parental or social support received. This will change throughout their life. Challenges to reducing oral health inequalities in vulnerable population groups The main challenges in improving the oral health of t hese population groups encompass a poor awareness of oral health, outside of the dental community, specifically in terms of oral health education, prevention, and how to access dental services. Furthermore, for those that engage with social services, oral health does not often feature in general care plans. Alongside a local of local data, these challenges are underpinned by a lack of evidence base in understanding the causes of poor oral health in these population groups. This needs to be 173 considered in th e wider context of the socio -economic determinants of health and oral health, ie the causes of the causes . Note that further information is detailed in Appendix C, where data is broken down to lower tier authority level. 174 Children attending special schoo ls At present there is no national (as this group is excluded from the national adult dental health survey) or local information on the oral health needs of children with learning disabilities. Across the South West, there are around 6,600 enrol led in spec ial schools. Table 36 shows the breakdown by local authority. Surveys show how more decayed teeth remain untreated, and teeth are more frequently extracted in children with a disability (Gizani et al 1997; Pope and Curzon 1991; Nunn and Murray 1987). In children with mild learning disabilities and children who are partly independent, prevalence of tooth decay is higher (Storhaug and Holst 1987). It would appear that these children may have fewer dietary restrictions and are therefore at greater risk of developing dental caries. Studies uniformly report poor standards of oral hygiene and plaque control, and poorer gum health in children with learning disabilities (Gizani et al 1997, Nunn and Murray 1987; Pope and Curzon 1991; Evans et al 1991, Storhaug and Holst 1987). A high proportion of children in special schools have periodontal disease (Evans et al 1991). Gum disease is more severe in children with Down Syndrome eve n when a good standard of oral hygiene is maintained. Table 36: Number of enrolments in state funded special schools 2012/13 (Department of Education) Area Name Pupil enrolments South Gloucestershire 315 Swindon 419 Wiltshire 360 BANES 348 North Somerset 225 Bristol 604 Somerset 364 Devon 722 Cornwall UA 275 Plymouth 546 Gloucestershire 917 Torbay 345 South West 6,635 England 79,855 175 Adults with learning disabilities At present there is no national (as this group is excluded from the national adult dental health survey) or local information on the oral health needs of adults with learning disabilities. Individuals with disabilities generally experience more oral disease, and have fewer teeth than the general popul ation. Many people with a disability are often in lower socioeconomic groups (Glassman and Subar 2010). People with intellectual disabilities have been found to have poorer oral hygiene, more gum disease and more untreated tooth decay than the general popu lation (Anders and Davis 2010). They also have greater unmet dental needs (Waldman and Perlman 2002) as they have more difficulty in accessing dental care (Glassman and Miller 2003). Furthermore, when oral diseases are treated they are more likely to have resulted in extractions than fillings, crowns and bridges, particularly for people living in residential care (Gallagher and Fiske 2006). An increased risk of oral health problems is evident among people with special needs for a number of reasons. Some c ongenital conditions and syndromes may adversely affect dental development and compromise oral health. When people's ability to care for themselves is reduced their diet and exposure to fluoride may not be under their personal control. Table 104 and Figur e 37 summarise the percentage and respective numbers of registered patients aged over 18, diagnosed with learning difficulties, by local authority . 176 Table 37: Numbers of persons with diagnosed learning difficulties (aged 18+), 2012/13 (QOF) Area BANES England 206,132 Figure 104: The percentage of registered patients aged 18+ diagnosed with learning difficulties, 2012/13 (QOF) 177 Homeless people Homeless people are a broad group comprising of the roofless, single people and families living in temporary accommodation. At present there is no national (as this group is excluded from the national adult dental health survey) or local information on the oral health needs of homeless people. The limited scientific literature reveals how homeless people tend to have poorer health than the rest of the population. Studies consistently reported high clinical need in terms of tooth decay, dental pain and p eriodontal diseases but low perceived need for oral health care (Daly et al 2010; Waplington et al 2000; Blackmore et al 1995). Commonly reported oral health impacts include toothache, discomfort, ability to relax and feeling ashamed regarding the appearan ce of their teeth (Richards and Keauffling 2009). The incidence of many cancers is known to be higher amongst lower socioeconomic groups. Within this low socioeconomic group of homeless men, there are also high levels of cancers of the oral cavity (Lamant et al. 1997). With regard to access to dental care, international studies have found that homeless people often do not access dental services routinely due to fear, cost, and difficulty in maintaining appointments (Conte et al 2006). 178 Statutory Homeless Households in the South West The level of statutorily homeless households in all area teams is lower than the national avera ge as summarised in Figure 105 below, which depict statutory Homeless Households, crude rate per 1,000 estimated total households, a ll ages, by upper tier local authorities. Figure 105: Statutory Homeless Households, crude rate per 1,000 estimated total households, all ages, by Upper Tier Local Authorities, 2012/13 (PHOF, Wider Determinants of Health, Indi cator 1.15ii) 179 Opiate and crack cocaine users There are no local robust data on the prevalence of oral disease in drug abusers. The limited scientific literature demonstrates how comparison with the general population, drug users tend to have far poorer oral health (Johnson et al 2008). Global research suggests that this could be due to a range of factors including poverty; self -neglect and poor oral hygiene; and a decay promoting diet (including the intake of methadone syrup (Titsas and Ferguson 2002; Zador et al 1996). Drug users also display lower utilisation of dental services (Robinson et al 2005). Improving dental care for this group of patients presents various challenges, given the high rates of dental disease and poor access t o dental services. 180 Prevalence of drug misuse in the South West Figure 106 depict s the estimated prevalence of opiate and/or crack Cocaine users, crude rate per 1,000 population, ages 15 -64, persons, by upper tier local authorities in the South West (2011). They demonstrate how the prevalence of drug abuse in BANES is similar to the national average, and above the national average in North Somerset; Torbay; Plymouth and Bristol.

However, as this is a socially deprived group, it seems reasonable to assume that disease levels will be high. A small study undertaken in East Hertfordshire confirm ed high levels of unmet need, low dental registration and very little use of preventive services, only attending when in pain (Edwards and Watt 1997). Control of their travelling was the major factor determining access to education and health services.

This group of children is likely to have poorer oral health and, if they are moved between different carers, more erratic and irregular access to dental care. Across the South West, currently this requirement is not being met as in Gloucestershire; North Somerset; Bristol; BANES; Plymouth; Cornwall and Isles of Scilly the figures are below the national average. It should be noted tha t attendance at a dental check -up does not provide any information about the quality of care or if any necessary treatment was completed Figure 108: Percentage of children who had their teeth checked by a dentist that had been looked after continuously for the previous 12 months, 2012/13 (Department of education) "}
