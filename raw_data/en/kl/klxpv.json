He was the fellow who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer with metastasis to t he bones. This was over 15 months ago and I wrote u p his story and shared his treatment diary in my Rich Man's Poor Man's Cancer Treatment bicarbonate book. He was going to do a cesium chloride treatment but because his order got lost in the mail ended up doi ng sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) orally, managed to get his urinary pH up to 8.5 for five days and the n within two weeks was back at his oncologists office for a test, which showed his bones being cleared o f his cancer. \"Cancer tried to kill me. After a struggle or two, or three, or four, or more I said, \"No!\" Or at leas t I was hoping for a \"No.\" I turned to Cesium, but ended u p with Baking Soda. My goal was to change my pH http://imva.info/index.php/2009/1 ... 1/16/2011 9:28:01 AM Page 2 of 11quickly. I knew little or next to nothing what pH, Alkaline or Acidic meant. Happily I found out,\" said Vernon Johnston. Talking to him on the phone was really nice for he seems just so full of life and is obviously alive a nd in very fine health and has not seen a doctor in a yea r. Now that is really good news. Dr. Tullio Simonci ni would have said this is impossible for he believes that even his expensive treatment with IVs would no t do the job but he was wrong and that is why I call for universal oral use in all cancers coupled with int ensive transdermal use as well. Vernon was written up in the Valley News this week and his new site can be seen at http://www.phkillscancer.com/home . If you are anywhere near Anza California this nex t weekend you can go to a free workshop (I suggest giving a donation) he will be giving on what he has been able to achi eve independent of the medical establishment with sodiu m bicarbonate and breathing (also very important fo r increasing O2 levels) and some other health practic es that have given him a completely new lease on li fe. (I owe my readership an essay on breathing for healing . I will say though that after talking to him and r eading his page on breathing I was inspired this morning t o do my own conscious breathing and I am ashamed fo r saying so little about this in my work.) Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) is the time honored method to 'speed up' the return of the body's bicarbonate lev els to normal. Sodium bicarbonate happens to be one of our most us eful medicines in existence treating as it does basic hu man physiology. Rich Man's Poor Man's Cancer Treatment I make it very clear in my Sodium Bicarbonate book that I do not believe in single solutions or cures for cancer being a full protocol practitioner. My overa ll treatment philosophy for cancer is to trap the c ancer in a deadly crossfire and beat the crap out of it with safe concentrated nutritional medicinals and solid health practices including plenty of sun exposure, exercis e, touch via massage, and breathing techniques that you can see on Vernon's site. But, as Vernon's case dem onstrates, the sodium bicarbonate is the lead Panze r Division that has the power to kick ass pretty much all by itself. Sodium bicarbonate is the least expensive, safest and perhaps most effective cancer medicine there is. Sodium Bicarbonate is a nothing to lose everything to gain treatment for cancer. Rich Man's Poor Man's Cancer Treatment Not sorry for the street language here because this is important information for humanity and in my Winning the War on Cancer book I use this analogy quite liberally. Even some thing as Yin as breathing can be used in quite a Yang way. Though I believe there are a h undred cures for cancer, many of them very good, an d though I like to combine the strongest of them toge ther into a comprehensive protocol, sodium bicarbon ate is a no brainer that even the poorest person can af ford and the richest man should use. Same can be sa id of iodine and magnesium chloride and it is heartening to hear more and more people using this combination . The bad news is that people are dropping like flies all over the world from escalating cancer because of increased toxins in the air, water and food (mercur y pollution for instance is still increasing and no w they want to vaccinate the world with mercury containing swine flu and influenza vaccines) there is more uranium in the air because of the use of depleted u ranium weapons by the American Military. Of course the quality of water most people are drinking and the s tress levels from the death throes of the vicious c orporate capitalist system is not helping anyone's immune sy stem. Vernon reminded me that originally Dr. Simoncini di d not endorse any use of oral bicarbonate but it se ems they have had a change of heart and at least are re commending it for certain cancers. I really do not understand what is going on with Dr. Simoncini and his followers. I tried to sign onto a yahoo group dedicated to his protocol and they rejected my appl ication. My assistant Claudia French RN said after carefully reading their information that she felt t hey were closed minded and were not interested in t he alkaline effect of sodium bicarbonate, which of cou rse is absolutely bizarre since it is one of its ma in effects. Dr. Simoncini seems stuck on his Candida t heory and the anti fungal properties of backing sod a and http://imva.info/index.php/2009/1 ... 1/16/2011 9:28:01 AM Page 3 of 11just really does not want to look too deeply into b icarbonates medical profile, which includes rushing more Oxygen to cancer cells through radical pH shifts an d increased CO2 levels. I am not against the use of IVs and recently talked to a doctor in Africa who uses them to great effec t against cancer and AIDS. I will not share her name openly at this point but I have known her for quite some time and am deeply impressed with her medical fines se. She says: \"If Simoncini is correct that cancer is fungus the MMS, which becomes chlorine dioxide in the body giv en intravenously will kill off the fungus in the body. The MMS is quite foul and distresses many peoples' stomachs so the reason it is given intravenously is that you can get a higher dose in without the same side effects. Also I found my patients had side effects from the bicarbonate IVs using Simoncini's protocol so I give it orally. So we get the same effect just admi nistering the agents differently. I found this work ed best for the patients I was treating. It so easy to give and does not give any discomfort. My protocol for treating people is to give them mag nesium and B6 with sodium chlorite intravenously an and sodium orally. magn esium sulfate or bag of 40 magnesium 50% and pyridoxine into the saline. I draw up 10ml 0f this mixture and that is given slow ly intravenously via a 23 butterfly needle. This is followed by a 20ml syringe filled as follows.1-2 ml 28% sodium chlorite and 5% glucose to fill the 20m l syringe. This mixture is sometimes activated with 2 ml of citric acid 10% and the sodium chlorite solut ion is reduced to 1/2 ml instead of the 1-2ml. So I am giving 30 ml into a vein. They feel of cour se the hot rush from the magnesium but they actuall y enjoy it because it does all the good magnesium thi ngs. Depending on the patient I do this either week ly or sometimes up to three times a week. I have these pa tients take half to a full teaspoon of sodium bicar bonate morning and evening and giving iodine mixed right i nto the bicarbonate. If it is a cancer patient I gi ve a product with three types of vitamin C (ascorbic aci d, calcium ascorbic and magnesium ascorbic which is mixed with L-Lysine but a few hours after the admin istration of the IV. I have a doctor friend in Moscow who uses the MMS t ransdermally driving it in with DMSO and he also reports good results but I have never been very com fortable with the mania around MMS and the way it i s marketed and put out with religious fever. I have h eard of many bad stories but I have to concede to s ome good ones as well and my doctor friends seem to hav e avoided the down side by cutting out the use of i t orally in favor of intravenous and transdermal appl ication. So Vernon is alive and well. Now of course he is no t the only cancer survivor and many have made it through various natural means and some few even des pite chemo and radiation therapy, which most alternative practitioners believe made cancer more not less dangerous. After all orthodox oncologists use treatments that cause cancer to cure it so we canno t expect life enhancing results. Surgical intervent ion, toxic chemo and radiation all are known to facilita te or cause cancer. What is remarkable about Vernon's case is that his result, and the same goes for Dr. Simoncini's patie nts, shows a clear cause and effect relationship between cancer, its elimination and sodium bicarbonate, th at simple household item that doubles behind hospital doors as an emergency room medicine. Yes some precautions need to be taken but most people can le arn to use it themselves safely like Vernon did. In my book much is explained for professional and patient alike but one does not need to fully understand bicarbonate no physiology to brush ones teeth with bicarbonate (which I highly recommend for everyone) or take it from the minute, or even way before one suspects one has cancer. The pH level of our internal fluids affects every c ell in our body. Chronic over acidity corrodes body tissue, and if l eft unchecked will interrupt all cellular activities and function s. In other words, over acidity interferes with life itself. It is at the root of cancer. Everyone should buy some pH strips and become famil iar with this invisible side of our lives. It is sa d that our schools do not teach us the rudiments of health and even medicine because it is not that difficult to fathom or practice. I intend to commit more time an d energy to bring the bicarbonate story to the worl d for http://imva.info/index.php/2009/1 ... 1/16/2011 9:28:01 AM Page 4 of 11it seems like the message is not getting out enough and many still don't get how simple it is. When I read the Cancer Tutor site's information I felt sad because it so misinforms wi th such little information an extremely valuable and amazingly inexpensive basic treatment for cancer.

Has this actually been tried using BSM and not boiling it be fore taking it and did it work as well as the maple syrup boiled with it? I thoroughly enjoy your newsletters. Do you have any more information on th e flu in UK? We don 't have a news media anymore, it has just become a pro paganda outlet. I fear we are much nearer to the new world order and global government than any of us want to be. I also realized how powerful the ones behind this a re when I realized the truth about our news media. The infamous \"flesh eating Organism\" was in all our MSM (radio, television, ma gazines, newspapers) until our morning paper printed an article quoting a Vanderbilt doctor as s aying he didn't know why everyone was so scared of this organism because it was the same strep orga nism that had been around causing strep infections for at least 40 or 50 years, only this one harbored a virus. I knew then that this was a laboratory manufactured organism, but wondered if it escaped t he lab accidentally or acidentally on purpose. When all mention of the \"flesh eating organism\" disappeared from MSM within 2 days, I knew the answer and I still don' t like it. It looks like the plan to reduce the population is alive and thriving. Thanks to a few people brave enough to stick their necks out, we did avert the swine flu vaccinations. However, I think our impostor leader has not rescinded the declaration of the swine flu being at pandemic leve l, so that means he can call martial law at any tim e. I like the way that WHO & CDC sent out orders to st op testing for swine flu but kept reporting it at high levels. Interestingly enough it seems that a very small percentage of the flu ca ses tested for swine flu tested negative for any ki nd of flu- I think the percentage for positives on any kind of flu was somewhere betw een 3 & 8%. Of course this didn't come out in MSM then and still hasn't. In this case at least, t he \"administrations crisis wasn't wasted - it was j ust honestly rebutted. Don't think they will try anothe r manufactured crisis until they can shut down the internet, because that is the only news source we h ave left. # 2 February 2010 at 3:54 am http://imva.info/index.php/2009/1 ... 1/16/2011 9:28:01 AM Page 5 of 11 Joyce Duke said: The line in the above comment \"Interestingly enough ,it seems that a very small percentage of the flu cases tested for swine flu tested positive\".

I am also in the present process of healing another skin cancer lesion on my upper arm, using the same method. This one was the size of a quarter in circumference; and standing about a 1/2 inch or more above the surface of the skin. It is now almos t completely flat, and much smaller than a dime in circumference. Thank you so much for your wonderful research, and presenting it to us!
