Anderson Pennsylvania Conference on Juvenile Justice The 2016 James E. Anderson Pennsylvania Conference on Juvenile Justice, sponsored by the Juvenile Court Judges' Commission, the Pennsylvania Coun - cil of Chief Juvenile Probation Officers, the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency, and the Juvenile Court Section of the Pennsylvania Conference of State Trial Judges, was held on November 2-4, 2016 at the Har - risburg Hilton & Towers. This year, more than 900 individuals registered for the conference. The theme for this year's conference was \"Emerging Issues in Juvenile Justice\". On Wednesday, November 2, 2016, judges and hearing officers from across the Commonwealth participated in a training session titled: \"Conducting Effective Hearings: Tools for Local Training\". During this session, participants viewed two versions of training videos depicting detention, disposition, and disposition review hearings. The first version reflecting less than desirable or poor practices throughout the hearing, the second reflecting elements of best practice. Fol - lowing the showing of each scenario, judges and hearing officers were provided the opportunity to provide interactive critique and discussion regarding the videos. These videos, along with accompanying reference guides and check - lists were distributed to all participants to be used for local training of juvenile justice stakeholders. Professional Caucuses On November 2, 2016, participants of the 2016 James E. Anderson Pennsylva - nia Conference on Juvenile Justice had an opportunity to join with colleagues from their area of specialty/interest within Pennsylvania's juvenile justice sys - tem to discuss issues of mutual concern and interest. A summary of the profes - sional caucus discussion will be included in next month's newsletter. Juvenile Defender Training Over fifty juvenile defenders from across Pennsylvania attended the 2016 James E. Anderson Pennsylvania Conference on Juvenile Justice and participated in a separate training track developed exclusively for them on Wednesday, No - vember 2nd.

A \"Judges Roundtable\" was also held on Thursday, No - vember 5th, at which time juvenile court judges joined the defenders for lunch and discussion centered around Diversion: Pros and Cons of Channeling Out Youthful Offenders from the Juvenile Justice System. The track ended with a JDAP Board Meeting. Youth Awards Program The 2016 Youth Awards Program was held on Wednes - day evening, November 2nd, and attended by over 400 people. Young people were recognized for being selected as winners in Creative Expression and Outstanding Achievement award categories. Additionally, the Juve - nile Court Section of the Pennsylvania Conference of State Trial Judges presented two deserving youth with James E. Anderson Juvenile Justice Youth Scholarship Awards, each in the amount of $1,500. This year's Youth Awards Speaker, Joseph Gonzales, provided a compelling message of inspiration and en - couragement from his life experiences, readily sharing a poignant story of hope and survival after experienc - ing several personal tragedies. He has spent many years mentoring youth and helping them to develop the road - map necessary to maximize their abilities and achieve success. Mr. Gonzales has been fortunate to work col - laboratively with the Honorable Judge Mark Tranquilli, Juvenile Court Judge from Allegheny County, and Rus - sell Carlino, Director of Juvenile Probation, also from Allegheny County. He values these and other relation - ships as they contribute to positive initiatives within the court system, as well as in the community. In addition, Mr. Gonzales serves as an advocate for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections and the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole where he has the opportunity to help influence system-involved persons overcome ob - stacles and make positive changes. Morning Plenary On Thursday morning, November 5th, Judge Kim Clark, Chairman of the Juvenile Court Judges' Com - mission, gave the \"Conference Welcome\", and noted that with its combination of quality training, awards programs, and the opportunity to exchange information and ideas about the critical issues facing our system, this annual gathering is truly unique, and is a reflection of the progressive nature of Pennsylvania's juvenile justice system. The morning plenary session, \" Inside the T eenage Brain \", was provided by Dr. Frances Jensen , Professor of Neurology and Chair of Neurology at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania and author of the book, \"The Teenage Brain\", released by Harper Collins in January 2015. Dr. Jensen is an advo - cate for the awareness of adolescent brain development, its distinct strengths and vulnerabilities, as well as the impact on medical, social, and educational issues unique to teenagers and young adults. Her presentation, \"Inside the Teenage Brain\", focused on connecting the ever- growing body of research on adolescent brain develop - ment with juvenile justice policies and practices. Dr. Jensen is also the Co-Director of the Penn Trans - lational Neuroscience Center and a Trustee of the Franklin Institute. She formerly served as Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School, Director of Translational Neuroscience, and Senior Neurolo - gist at Boston Children's Hospital and the Brigham & Women's Hospital. She is a graduate of Cornell Medical College and did her neurology residency training at the Harvard Longwood Neurology Residency Program. Workshops Almost 600 people registered to attend sixteen different workshops on Thursday, November 3rd. In an effort to allow participants to maximize exposure to the selected topics, the morning workshops were repeated in an af - ternoon session (except the two judges workshops). The workshops included: Trauma Assessment and Treatment: What Judges Need to Know The Standardized Program Evaluation Protocol: What Judges Need to Know Probation Officer Self-Care: Proven Strategies to a Successful Career Philadelphia Police Diversion Program: Dismantling the School to Prison Pipeline Advancing Effective Case Planning: A Panel Discussion The Path to a Trauma Informed Juvenile Probation Department An Evaluation of Cumberland County's Risk Reduction Efforts 22 The Dynamics of Adolescent Females and Addiction Uncovering the World of the Transgender Youth Data and the Juvenile Justice System: Recent Developments in PaJCMS and JNET Introduction to the Effective Practices in Community Supervision (EPICS) Model Victim Offender Dialogue: Toward Successful Victim Restoration Practice Exposing Opiate Abuse and Other Current Drug Trends Enhancing Family Involvement in Residential Treatment Services The Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) and its Effects on the Juvenile Justice System Autism in the Juvenile Justice System: Strategies for Success Thursday Afternoon Plenary Session The afternoon plenary session entitled Teens and Tech - nology: The Hidden Dangers, featured Mr. James Dill. His presentation was a unique, interactive, and eye-opening experience. Mr. Dill shared informa - tion on supposedly self-destructing photo apps, secret messaging apps, information hidden in digital photos, location sharing, sextortion, and the way some juveniles are hiding things from their parents, teachers, and law enforcement. In addition to showing the hidden dangers of technology, he provided tools, resources, and advice to help navigate the world of teens and technology. Mr. Dill is a Summa Cum Laude graduate of the Indi - ana University of PA, with a BA in Criminology. He is a 30-year veteran of the PA Office of Attorney General, with 27 of those years in the unit responsible for inves - tigative technology and counter surveillance matters. Throughout his career, he has participated in hundreds of cases involving the use of investigative technology for the Attorney General, as well as with a variety of federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. He currently serves as a subject matter expert and instruc - tor for his own company (ITIS, LLC) as well as Alutiiq International and the Northeast Counterdrug Training Center. His \"Darker Side of Technology\" series has pro - vided valuable insight and understanding on the misuse of today's technology to probation officers, law enforce - ment, judges, businesses, victim advocate groups, educa - tors, and community organizations across the country.Annual Awards Program and Dinner Thursday's activities concluded with the 36th Annual Awards Program and Dinner. The Juvenile Court Judg - es' Commission and the Pennsylvania Council of Chief Juvenile Probation Officers honored both individuals and programs for their outstanding work in Pennsylva - nia's juvenile justice system. (See pages 4-5 for this year's award winners) Resource Day The 2016 Pennsylvania Conference on Juvenile Justice concluded with Resource Day on November 4th. Con - ference participants had the opportunity to learn about new, innovative, and creative approaches to working with juveniles. Representatives from private and public residential programs, informational services, technology services, and other vendors were available to present in - formation and discuss products and services. Attendees of Resource Day, which totaled more than 500 people, were eligible to participate in a raffle sponsored by the Pennsylvania Council of Chief Juvenile Probation Of - ficers.

Cummings, President 5Legislative Updates Act 138 of 2016 Amends Public School Code HB 1907 P.N. 4045 was signed into law by Gover - nor Tom Wolf on November 3, 2016, becoming Act 138 of 2016. Act 138 amends the truancy provi - sions of the Public School Code and culminates a number of years of activity and effort on the part of many individuals and groups including the Supreme Court's Educational Success and Truancy Prevention Workgroup chaired by Judge John Kuhn of Adams County, and the Joint State Government Commis - sion's Truancy Advisory Committee created through House Resolution 1032 of 2014. Act 138 contains the following provisions relating to truancy: The term \"truant\" is defined as unexcused absences of three (3) or more school days during the current school year. The term \"habitually truant\" is defined as unexcused absences for six (6) or more days during the current school year. Charter, regional charter and cyber charter schools are required to develop attendance policies designed to accurately determine when a child who is enrolled in such a school has an unexcused absence which may differ from the policy of the school district in which the child resides. Charter, regional charter and cyber charter schools are required to report unexcused absences directly to the Department of Education on an annual basis. Schools would be required to notify, in writing, the person in parental relation to the child of the child's violation of compulsory school attendance within ten (10) school days of the child's third unexcused absence, and may include the offer of a school attendance improvement conference. If the child continues to incur unexcused absences after the school has issued the aforementioned notice, the school is required to offer a school attendance improvement conference unless previously held. The outcome of the school attendance improvement conference must be documented in a written school attendance improvement plan. Further legal action may not be taken by the school to address unexcused absences until after the date for the scheduled school attendance improvement conference has passed. When a habitually truant child is under fifteen (15) years of age, the school would be required to refer the child to either a school or community- based attendance improvement program or the county children and youth agency; and may file a citation against the parents with a magisterial district judge. When a habitually truant child is fifteen (15) years of age or older, the school must either refer the child to a school or community-based attendance improvement program or file a citation with a magisterial district judge. If the child continues to incur additional unexcused absences after being referred to a school or community-based attendance improvement program, or refuses to participate in said program, the school may refer the child to the county children and youth agency. It shall be an affirmative defense if the person in parental relation to the child took every reasonable step to ensure attendance of the child at school. A person convicted of violating compulsory school attendance requirements may be: Sentenced to pay a fine not exceeding $300 for an initial offense, not to exceed $500 for a second offense, and not to exceed $750 for a third or subsequent offense, all determined in conjunction with ability to pay; Sentenced to perform community service; or Required to complete an appropriate course or program designed to improve school attendance which has been approved by the president judge of the judicial district. No citation may be filed against a child or person in parental relation if: 66 A proceeding is already pending for violating compulsory school attendance requirements; A referral for services has been made to the county children and youth agency and the agency has not closed the case; or A petition has been filed alleging the child is dependent due to being habitually truant and the case remains under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. Upon a second or subsequent conviction of violating compulsory school attendance requirements within three years, the magisterial district judge is required to refer the child for services or possible disposition as a dependent child. Upon failure of a person in parental relation to satisfy the penalty imposed, the court may, after finding the person had reasonable ability to comply with the penalty imposed and that the noncompliance was willful, impose a period of incarceration not to exceed three days in any one case. In the case of a child, the failure to satisfy a fine or costs imposed shall not be considered a delinquent act. The president judge of a judicial district may adopt a local policy to provide that a juvenile probation officer may receive allegations that the child who fails to satisfy a fine or costs imposed under Act 138 is dependent for the purposes of considering the commencement of proceedings under the Juvenile Act. Magisterial district judges have the discretion to suspend the driver's license of a child convicted of violating compulsory school attendance requirements. The Department of Transportation may restore the operating privileges of a child whose driving privilege has been suspended upon certification by the child's school that the child has attended school without an unexcused absence or an unexcused tardy for a period of at least two months after the first conviction, or four months after the second or subsequent conviction; is subject to an exception to compulsory school attendance; or graduates, withdraws from school, receives a GED or enlists in the military. Upon application from the child who has a conviction under Act 138, accelerated expungement procedures have been developed under delineated circumstances. Act 138 shall apply beginning with the 2017 - 2018 school year. Questions regarding Act 138 may be directed to Rick Steele at ricsteele@pa.gov or at 717-787-6910.

Consistent with this ideology, on January 1, 2017, Pennsylvania will make the conversion to YLS 2.0. YLS 2.0 is an updated version of our current risk/needs assess - ment, the YLS/CMI. The updates and enhancements included in YLS 2.0 are based on a large and current normative sample. The normative sample used to advance YLS 2.0 is based on data collected from 2001 to 2008 on 12,798 youth offenders from across the United States. The sample contains significant gen - der and minority representation, as well as significant represen - tation of youth in both community and institutional settings. YLS 2.0 contains no changes with respect to how a juvenile justice professional administers the assessment. In fact, comparable to the original YLS, the completion of YLS 2.0: Requires a structured interview with the youth and family, along with the collection of information from additional sources. Requires the assessor to rate the youth on the same 42 risk factors contained in the original YLS. Provides for the assessor to identify the youth's strengths. Provides for the assessor to identify youth and family related responsivity factors. Provides for the option of a Professional Override. On the other hand, the updated normative sample informs several significant and useful changes to the assessment. Specifically, YLS 2.0 contains more youth related responsivity factors along with improved definitions for many of the responsivity factors. Also, YLS 2.0 offers improved definitions for the use of strengths. Finally, YLS 2.0 includes updated overall risk level cutoffs based on gender. Currently, staff at the Center for Juvenile Justice Training and Research are finalizing the integration of YLS 2.0 into the PaJCMS, and YLS Master Trainers are training local staff on the elements of the conversion. Any questions related to YLS 2.0 or the conversion process should be directed to the co-chairs of the Chiefs Coun - cil's Assessment/Case Planning Committee, Lutz ( lelutz@ pa.gov ). A NORMATIVE SAMPLE IS A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE WHO WILL BE ASSESSED. THE NORMATIVE SAMPLE IS USED AS A REFERENCE SOURCE OR CONTEXT FOR EVALUATING ASSESSMENT SCORES.

THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONE TIME ONLY. Location: Child Welfare Resource Center, 403 East Winding Hill Road, Mechanicsburg, PA 17055 Use of the Standardized Program Evaluation Protocol (SPEP) Begins in Mercer County On October 31, 2016, Mark Benedetto, Chief Juvenile Probation Officer in Mercer County, congregated with state and local stakeholders to introduce the Standard - ized Program Evaluation Protocol (SPEPTM) process in Mercer County via the SPEP Kickoff Event. Ad - ditional presenters included Pam Farkas, Community- Based Juvenile Probation Officer, Heather Perry, Ju - venile Justice System Improvement Specialist for the EPISCenter at Penn State University, and Joe Joseph, Keystone Adolescent Center, Programming and Qual - ity Control. Among the attendees were representatives from the Magisterial District Judges, Mercer County Commissioners, District Attorney's Office, Juvenile Probation, District Attorney Victim/Witness Program, AWARE, Value Behavioral Health, the Shenango Val - ley Urban League, Children and Youth Services, school officials, law enforcement/police, Communities That Care Prevention Board Members, Sharon Regional Health System, Community Counseling Center, Penn State University - Shenango Campus, and community-based and residential service providers. Media coverage was provided by a local newspaper, The Record Argus. The SPEP TM Kickoff Event encompassed a presentation on the Juvenile Justice System Enhancement Strategy (JJSES) that included an overview of the Youth Level of Service (YLS) risk assessment tool, the research supporting the SPEP TM and the benefits that participa - tion in the SPEPTM process will serve county agencies (Juvenile Probation and Children and Youth Services), service providers, and the youth and families involved in the Juvenile Justice System. Event participants received a broad overview of the SPEP TM instrument and its relationship to risk reduction and recidivism, followed by comments by Mr. Joseph from Keystone Adolescent Center. The Keystone Adolescent Center is Mercer County's first local residential and community-based service provider to participate in the SPEP TM process. Pam Farkas has led several pre-SPEPTM meetings with community-based and residential service providers. This 12 to 18 month service evaluation process is currently underway with the Keystone Adolescent Center, and it is anticipated that the SPEP TM process will eventually include other Mercer County community-based and residential service providers that serve youth from across the Commonwealth. The SPEPTM is a validated, data-driven assessment tool developed by Dr. Mark Lipsey, former Director of the Peabody Research Institute at Vanderbilt University. Based on a meta-analysis of more than 700 research studies of programs designed to reduce delinquency, it is used to determine how well the characteristics of an existing program match the research evidence of delinquency reduction for that type of intervention. Pennsylvania was one of the first states to pilot the SPEP TM beginning with Berks County's participation in the Juvenile Justice System Improvement Project through Georgetown University's Center for Juvenile Justice Reform in 2011. In 2013, the pilot expanded to include Bucks, Lehigh, Allegheny, and Dauphin Coun - ties. In October 2015, the project expanded further to include Luzerne, Lycoming, McKean, Mercer, Venango, and York Counties. To date, more than 100 services have been through, or are currently going through, the SPEP TM process. 9Allegheny County Sends a Team to the School-Justice Partnership Certificate Program If an innovative approach to school discipline could increase graduation rates, decrease juvenile justice referrals, and improve school climate, would you want to learn more? Allegheny County heard about the success of School-Justice Partnership and recently assembled a cross-system, cross-discipline School-Justice Partnership team to explore this concept. Allegheny County was one of only seven teams selected by Georgetown University's Center for Juve - nile Justice Reform to attend this year's School-Justice Partnership's Certificate Program. Teams from Delaware, Montana, Oklahoma, Oregon, Arizona, and Washington also participated. Allegheny County's success - ful implementation of the crossover youth practice model, unique data warehouse, and programs based on best prac - tices, such as the Truancy Prevention Program, made it an ideal candidate for the certificate program. Allegheny County's contingent was also one of the larg - est teams in attendance with seven members (listed below), reflecting the county's commitment to this initiative. Honorable Dwayne Woodruff Shawn Forbes, Assistant Chief Probation Officer Marsha Landers, Crossover Systems Liaison Melanie King, Juvenile Justice Planner Sanjeev Baidyaroy, Data Analyst, Allegheny County Department of Human Services Sarah Marker, Case Practice Specialist, Allegheny County Department of Human Services Michael Loughren, School Principal, Carlynton School District The team spent a week in September listening to presentations from national experts, such as Judge Steven Teske from Clayton County, Georgia, interacting with other jurisdictions, and performing small group work. The intense agenda covered school-based practices and policies; culture change and leadership; fam - ily, youth and community engagement; and cross-system practices and policies. Since their return, the team is designing and implementing a Capstone Project, a requirement of the cer - tificate program. Participants are expected to implement a reform effort to build the capacity for effective action to achieve desired results. Allegheny County's Capstone Project focuses on improving the atten - dance, behavior, and academic performance of juvenile-justice involved students, or those who are at risk of becoming so involved, through a judicially led collaborative pilot program which reduces restrictive disci - pline practices, emphasizes restorative justice practices, limits referrals to the juvenile justice system and is trauma informed. The team looks forward to working with schools and communities interested in promoting an ongoing en - gagement in school among youth at risk, re-engaging students who have been disconnected, and improv - ing academic outcomes for all. Please contact Melanie King at 412-350-0214 or kingm@alleghenycourts. us for more information. From Left to Right: Melanie King, Shay Bilchik (CJJR Director), Sarah Marker, Sanjeev Baidyaroy, Michael Loughren, Shawn Forbes, Judge Dwayne Wood - ruff, and Marsha LandersPilot Training of the Effective Practices in Community Supervision (EPICS) Model On October 17-19, the University of Cincinnati Corrections Institute (UCCI) trained thirty-two probation officers from seven different counties (Berks, Lehigh, Allegheny, McKean, Mercer, Montgomery, and Crawford) on the first pilot of the Effective Practices in Community Supervision (EPICS) model at the Days Inn in State College. Over the course of the three day interactive training, probation officers were exposed to the foundation of the Prin - ciples of Effective Interventions, maintaining collaborative relationships with juveniles, goal setting, implementing effective interventions in one-on-one sessions, and the continuing support of positive behavior change. EPICS is a model of probation supervision designed to improve officer's one-on-one sessions and increase dosage for moderate and high risk offenders. EPICS accomplishes this goal by stressing adherence to the Risk-Need-Respon - sivity (R-N-R) model and core correctional practices. It provides a structure and focus on reducing criminogenic needs to individual sessions. The EPICS model is not meant to replace any formal cognitive behavioral program - ming for those moderate and high risk offenders who need it. It can be used with juveniles in programming to support and reinforce what is being learned and/or teach them additional new skills. EPICS can also be used as a relapse prevention strategy. Following the training, these thirty-two probation officers will continue on with six months of coaching from train - ers with the University of Cincinnati to demonstrate proficiency in each of the areas of the EPICS model. If you would like more information on the EPICS model, please visit the JCJC website under the annual conference tab. SAVE THE DATE for the 2017 Pathways for Victims Services Conference !

Initially conducted to determine the relationships that existed between certain juvenile and system-level variables, the cur - rent report serves to highlight how juvenile offender characteristics and juvenile recidivism trends have changed over time in Pennsylvania. Recidivism is defined as: within two years of case closure, a subse - quent adjudication of delinquency occurs in juvenile court or conviction in criminal court for a felony or misdemeanor offense. Analyses for the current study were based on data collected from youth with cases closed from Pennsylvania juvenile probation departments between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2012. The outcomes presented in this report are reflective of 110,881 youth with cases closed in this time period. Data for this project was compiled from the Pennsylvania Juvenile Case Management System (PaJCMS) and the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Court's (AOPC) Common Pleas Case Man - agement System (CPCMS). The following article is Part 3 of a four-part series meant to disseminate the results of this comprehensive work. It will focus on demographic variables. Part 4 will be published in a forthcoming issue. To review a full copy of the report or the Research Brief, please visit: www.jcjc.pa.gov . Juveniles who committed the following offenses consistently had the lowest recidivism rates over the six-year time period examined: non- payment of fines, possession of weapon on school property, indecent assault, and retail theft. Conversely, juveniles who committed the following offenses consistently had the highest recidivism rates: firearm-related offenses, unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, possession with intent to deliver, and robbery. Across the six years examined, the proportion of juveniles who committed drug offenses and other offenses remained relatively stable. However, the percentage of juveniles who committed person offenses increased about 25% (or six percentage points), from 23% in 2007 to 29% in 2012. Similarly, the percentage of juveniles who had committed property offenses decreased about 12% (or three percentage points), from 26% to 23%. Between 2007 and 2012, drug offenders consistently had the highest recidivism rates among offenders. The recidivism rate of juveniles who committed other offenses dropped substantially (30% or seven percentage points) over time, from a high of 23% in 2009 to a low of 16% in 2012. 1212 Between 2007 and 2012, person offenders, property offenders, and drug offenders were most likely to return to the same types of crimes when they recidivated (i.e., exhibit offense type specialization). In addition, in that six-year time period, drug offenders exhibited the greatest degree of offense type specialization. The recidivism rates of felony offenders dropped between 2007 (23%) and 2011 (21%), most notably between 2009 (28%) and 2011 (21%), before increasing again in 2012 (25%). The recidivism rates of ungraded/summary offenders decreased 36% (or eight percentage points), from a high of 22% in 2008, 2009, and 2010 to a low of 14% in 2012. Between 2007 and 2012, youth with more formal dispositions on their base case had higher recidivism rates than juveniles with less formal dispositions. Across the six years examined, juveniles who committed sex offenses recidivated (both sex offenses and non-sex offenses) at rates substantially lower than the statewide average. Regardless of the grading of the offense of the base case, the majority of recidivists committed misdemeanor offenses when they recidivated. This trend was consistent across all six years examined. The percentage of juveniles who committed misdemeanors on their base case remained consistent between 2007 and 2012. However, the percentage of juveniles who committed a felony offense increased about 20% (or four percentage points), from 19% in 2007 to 23% in 2012. Conversely, the percentage of youth who committed ungraded/summary offenses in this six-year time period decreased about 20% (or five percentage points), from 24% in 2007 to 19% in 2012. Between 2007 and 2012, the rate at which sex offenders were adjudicated delinquent or convicted in criminal court for a subsequent sex offense ranged from 1.0% (in 2009) to 2.3% (in 2010). The percentage of sex offenders identified as White Non-Hispanic declined steadily between 2007 and 2012, while the percentage of sex offenders identified as Black Non-Hispanic and Hispanic increased steadily in this same time period. The majority of sex offenders had a family status of parents never married. 13The Pennsylvania Youth Suicide Prevention Initiative is proud to offer the 2017 Pennsylvania High School PAYSPI invites high school students to submit a public service announcement (PSA) focused on messages of hope.
