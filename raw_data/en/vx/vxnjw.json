His transformative journey began 14 years ago when he emerged from a near-death encounter, bestowed with profound insights on connecting individuals with their \"indwelling God Presence.\" Since that extraordinary event, Dr. Mathews has maintained a conscious and unwavering connection with the luminous Beings of Light he encountered during his near death experience. Through this ongoing communication, he receives continuous updates on how to enhance his service to people, the Earth, and humanity as a whole. His compassionate nature shines through as he generously shares these revelations with everyone he encounters. Driven by an unwavering dedication, he has devoted himself entirely to the noble cause of uplifting humanity and nurturing the planet with his extraordinary gift. Where did HOLY DIVINE HEALING originate? Learn more by watching his [interview](http://holy-divine-healing.com/dr-dan-mathews-videos/). In August of 1992, Dr. Dan Mathews underwent a profound near-death experience that forever changed the course of his life. During his time on the other side of the veil, he received a sacred ordination into the esteemed priesthood of Melchizedek. It was during this extraordinary encounter that he was bestowed with invaluable insights regarding the concept of \"paradigms,\" which refer to the levels of consciousness present on Earth. Dr. Dan was enlightened about the existence of three paradigms or realities that had prevailed since the original fall of humanity. The first paradigm had its inception at the dawn of time, followed by the second paradigm that emerged with Abraham, and the third paradigm that manifested during the life of Jesus. Furthermore, he was informed that, starting in 2003, humanity would embark upon a rapid and transformative evolution of consciousness, traversing an additional twelve new paradigms. Upon receiving this profound knowledge, Dr. Dan was blessed with the gift of HOLY DIVINE HEALING. Instructed to return to his earthly body, he was destined to utilize this extraordinary ability to assist individuals in reconnecting with fragmented aspects of their soul, which had endured since the beginning of time. Through this process, he guides them in gracefully navigating the transitions across shifting paradigms while establishing a profound connection with the indwelling God Presence within. Since his transformative experience in 1992, Dr. Dan has served as a guiding light for numerous individuals, offering his assistance through one-on-one sessions conducted in person or via phone. Additionally, he imparts his wisdom and healing abilities through group healings and lectures, aiding countless individuals in their personal journeys through shifting paradigms. \"At the dawn of time (the downfall), man lost consciousness to knowing of the God Presence within and the first paradigm of consciousness came into being. This paradigm created the drama and confusion that has driven the most primal human actions and, as a result, humans have evolved to think with the mind and take actions based on the beliefs given to us through the ego. This original disconnection is where the roots of fear, anxiety, anger, loneliness and depression that fill most human experiences first began. This disconnection is not required. HOLY DIVINE HEALING can help you reacquire the consciousness you lost at the dawn of time.\" - Dr. Dan Mathews What can I expect from a HOLY DIVINE HEALING session? After a session, expressing the deep-seated transformation is challenging. You realize that a significant shift has taken place, enhancing your connection with the divine within. HOLY DIVINE HEALING is powered by the God presence that sustains your life, with Dr. Dan serving as the facilitator. He links with your divine presence, which knows your life intimately and thus, tailors your healing session to your needs. Since March 2002, Dr. Dan, based in Little Rock, has consistently trusted his own divine presence and inspired others to do the same. He genuinely practices what he preaches and refrains from judging others. He merely assists if requested. During the healing, he connects with his Christ Consciousness to engage with the person's God presence. His healing work addresses vulnerabilities in our divine self caused by life's negative experiences, leading to spontaneous healing and self-reintegration. Dr. Dan emphasizes that his work helps individuals recognize their unique gifts. This has proven true, as many have acknowledged their self-worth and individual talents following his sessions. Regardless of the overarching theme in someone's life-relationships, jobs, friendships, health, or wealth-this work enhances happiness, health, and prosperity. While the effects may not be instant, some health issues have been known to disappear immediately. From Dr. Dan Mathews: \"At birth, you are a perfect being. Every cell in your body has a function; each one knows what to do and how to work as a team in harmony with other cells in your body. When the world is out of balance: war, famine, pollution, greed, anger, fear, etc. - we react! We react by working long hours, eating too much, not getting enough sleep, leaving us to live in fear and anger, tense, exhausted, and in pain. The cells in our body record how we react to stress and insure that we react that same way again and again. This becomes a vicious cycle that unconsciously perpetuates itself. This simple process of Holy Divine Healing brings light to your body, freedom to your mind and calm to your emotions. HDH increases your vital energy, resulting in a stronger, clearer, conscious connection with your higher power. HDH allows the God presence within to orchestrate the rebalancing and healing of your body on all levels. All that is required from the seeker is to trust in God. This means being open and trusting to letting God decide what is best for you. The Holy Spirit that you are is a morphic field. In fact, all expressions of life are morphic in nature. Because of this, as you allow God to cleanse and heal your Holy Spirit through HDH, you are actually taking positive action steps to help heal the Earth and all life on this Earth and beyond. Everyone's own personal blessing is stored in the Cosmic Hall of Records and continues to heal all of like kind. It spread throughout the entire world and beyond.\" How can I receive Holy Divine Healing from Dr. Dan?
