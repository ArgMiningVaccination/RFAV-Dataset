In the Chinese system of reflexology, the foot is believed to contain natural energy zones connected to the major organ systems of the body. In acupuncture, these zones are activated through the insertion of needles. Detoxification through the feet is a combination of this idea with Chinese herbal medicine, resulting in the secretion of internal toxins in a manner similar to sweating. Prepare a foot bath. Special ionic foot baths are marketed for detoxification of the body through the feet, and are said to provide relief from a broad range of maladies, including migraines, hypertension, diabetes, acne, arthritis, depression and fatigue. First, add water and salt to the small bathtub or spa. Then soak your feet in the bath for up to 20 minutes as a current of ions is passed through the water by an attached array. Soon, the water will change colors, revealing the types of toxins being removed. Compare the water to a toxin chart. Soon after inserting your feet, the water in the ionic bath will change colors, revealing the types of toxins being removed. An ionic foot bath should come with a chart matching the color of the water as it changes to denote specific types of detoxification. For example, black water indicates toxins from the liver, whereas orange suggests the removal of toxins from joints. This information can be used to select other herbal remedies to continue the detoxification process. Attach a patch. Another way to increase the detoxification of the body through the feet is to use a homeopathic foot patch. These are impregnated with wood-vinegar essence from certain medicinal trees in the Chinese system; they can be affixed to the sole of the foot like a sticker and worn overnight. In the morning, you will usually discover that the patch has changed color, reflecting the toxins pulled out of the body through the feet. Tip Detoxification through the feet via any or all of these methods is ideally carried out daily, until the water or patch remains clean after a normal period of use. Warning The claims of foot-detox products are not supported by most doctors or the FDA.
