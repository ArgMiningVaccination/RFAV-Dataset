Chronic insomnia is a common sleep disorder in the elderly. Patients often experience changes in sleeping pattern, sleepefciency, and sleep -wake cycle. 1In recent years, the inci- dence of insomnia has continued to rise.2According to statis- tics, the incidence of insomnia among Chinese adults is as highas 38.2%. 3About a third of elder people suffer from insomnia,which is a common problem that impairs their life quality.4 Human nervous system and other physiological functions degenerate while aging, leading to an increasing insomnia rate that negatively impact life quality of the elderly.5,6The main clinical symptoms of senile chronic insomnia includereduced sleeping time, decreased sleep quality, fragmentedKeywords chronic insomnia Guasha (scraping) acupuncture spirit-calming and blood-nourishingdecoctionAbstract Objective To observe the ef cacy of treating senile chronic insomnia with spirit- calming and blood-nourishing decoction combined with Guasha (scraping) andacupuncture therapy. Methods Seventy elderly patients with chronic insomnia were included and num- bered by their visiting sequence. They were randomly divided into the control groupand the observation group, 35 patients for each. Spirit-calming and blood-nourishingdecoction was given to the control group, whereas Guasha (scraping) and acupuncturewere applied together with the spirit-calming and blood-nourishing decoction to theobservation group. Both groups were treated for 4 weeks before comparing theirPittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score and clinic ef cacy. Results PSQI scores of both groups were signi cantly lowered. Compared with the control group, the differences are statistically signi cant ( p<0.01). After treatment, the PSQI score of the observation group is (6.80 /C61.37), whereas that of the control group is (10.83 /C62.51). PSQI score of the observation group is lower ( p<0.01). The effective rate was 85.7% in the observation group and 62.9% in the control group.Difference of the effective rates of both groups is statistically signi cant ( p<0.01). Conclusion Spirit-calming and blood-nourishi (scraping) and acupuncture is signi cantly effective in treating senile chronic insomnia. The combined therapy can effectively relieve the symptoms. received November 3, 2022 accepted after revisionDecember 27, 2022DOI https://doi.org/ 10.1055/s-0043-1770076. ISSN 2096-918X.\u00a9 2023.

Guasha (scraping) is among the top 10 widest applied TCM nursing techniques at present and is getting increasingly popular.9According to the different syn- drome types, clinical characteristics, and patients 'different conditions, treating insomnia with Guasha (scraping) based on syndrome differentiation makes positive effect on patients ' symptoms. Guided by traditional meridians theory, it is sim- ple, practical, and safe and can be used as one of the clinical methods to treat insomnia.10Similarly, acupuncture has the advantages of high safety and good curative effect in treating insomnia.11Some scholars have found that Guasha (scraping) and acupuncture are both effective in treating insomnia.12-14 Treating senile chronic insomnia with spirit-calming and blood-nourishing decoction combined with Guasha (scraping) and acupuncturewasproved to have signi cantcurative effect. Data and Methods General Data Seventy elderly patients with chronic insomnia participated in this research. They received treatment in the outpatientdepartment of the Third Af liated Hospital of Henan Univer- sity of Chinese Medicine from July 2021 to August 2022. The participants were numbered by their visiting sequence andrandomly divided into the control group and the observation group, with 35 patients in each group. There was no statisti- cal signi cance in the general data between the two groups (p>0.05), indicating comparability ( Table 1 ). Diagnostic Criteria Diagnostic criteria of Western medicine: Refer to the Diag- nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders publishedby the American Psychiatric Association 15and the chronic insomnia stated in Chinese Adult Insomnia Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines published by the Chinese Journal ofNeurology in 2017. 16All patients were assessed by Pitts- burgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)17before the rst treatment, with an overall score of /C217. Diagnostic criteria of TCM: Refer to the Diagnostic and Therapeutic Criteria of TCM Syndrome issued by the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine.18Meanwhile, according to syndrome differentiation of TCM, senile chronic insomnia in this research is divided into the following patterns: \u0081Liver constraint transforming into re: dif culty in falling asleep, irritability, bitter taste in the mouth and dry throat,chest tightness and red eyes, yellow urine and constipation, red tongue with yellow coating, wiry rapid pulse. \u0081Phlegm-heat harassing the interior: less sleep and profuse dreaming, drowsy head and eyes, bitter taste in the mouth, irritability, poor appetite, excessive phlegm and sticky mouth, red tongue with yellow greasy coating, rapid slippery pulse.

Age selection: Considering that older patients are not suitable for treatment in the outpatient department, patients aged from 60 to 80 were included in this study. Case Inclusion Criteria Age range: 60 to 80 years old; meet the diagnostic standards of TCM and Western medicine; elderly patients with chronicinsomnia who are suitable for TCM treatment; willing to participate in the study and sign a consent form. Case Screening Criteria (1) Insomnia caused by serious organic disease; (2) patients with poor cardiopulmonary function that affect their normallife; (3) patients depending on sleep aids like benzodiaze- pines or melatonin before the treatment; (4) patients partic- ipating in other clinical drug-trial researches; (5) patientswith unwell physical condition like skin bleeding tendency, not suitable for Guasha (scraping) or acupuncture; (6) patients with poor compliance who could not insist for 4 weeks. Case Exclusion Criteria (1) Patients experience discomfort and adverse incidents during treatment; (2) other interventions are required if anunexpected illness occurs during treatment; (3) those with poor compliance who cannot normally cooperate with the treatment; (4) data missing during the intervention period,which affected the collection of results; (5) withdraw from the study voluntarily. Treating Method All the TCM operations involved in this study were per- formed in the outpatient TCM treatment room of the ThirdAfliated Hospital of Henan University of Chinese Medicine. Control Group Modi ed spirit-calming and Sinensis de ciency, Ejiao (Asini shallbe (Ginseng Radix etRhizoma) g shall be added; for with ascendant hyperactivity of liver (Fossilia Ossis Mastodi) 15 g shall be added;for patients with phlegm re disturbing spirit, Huanglian (Coptidis Rhizoma) 10 g and Zhuru (Bambusae Caulis in Taenia) 10 g shall be added. The above medicinal ingredientswere provided by the pharmacy of the Third Af liated Hospital of Henan University of Chinese Medicine and uni- formly decocted in the decocting room. Each dose wasdecocted in 200 mL of water. The decoction was taken twice a day (in the morning and in the evening) for 28 days. Observation Group Guasha (scraping) therapy and acupuncture are applied in addition to the treatment of control group. The operationtime of acupuncture should refer to the Ziwu Liuzhu theory (meridian flow theory) and follow the \"Shen-You period acupuncture method. \" 20Points 7), 62), 6), 36), Xuanzhong Taixi (KI 3), Sanyinjiao (SP 6), Taichong (LR 3)].21-24Speci ca c u p u n c t u r e operation was determined by outpatient physicians based on syndrome differentiation. Treating duration is 30 to35 min/time, 5 times per week for 4 weeks. Guasha (scraping) operation was in compliance with Basic Nursing of Traditional Chinese Medicine. 25According to the clinical practice guidelines of TCM for insomnia (WHO/WPO),26Baihui (GV 20) and Fengchi (GB 20) were selected; acupoints on head, back, and upper extremities were added as supplement. Speci c points are as follows: (1) head and neck: Taiyang (EX-HN 5), the lower one-third of parafrontal and frontal parietal area, obliquely lower one-third of parietotemporal area (bilateral); 20) extremities: spleen meridian \u2014bilateral Sanyinjiao (SP 6). Sterile operation process was followed to protect the patient. Direct scraping method wasadopted. Skin at the treatment site was wiped clean with a warm towel before treatment. After applying the scraping lubricant, the operator holds the scraping board in his righthand (the board is always kept 45 -90 degrees with the skin of the patient), then scrape the patient 's skin downwardly and outwardly in a single direction until red and purplespots appear. Guasha (scraping) treatment was operated between 3:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m., 5 days a week for continuous 4 weeks. Chinese Medicine and Natural Products Vol. 3 No. 2/2023 \u00a9 2023. The Author(s).Treating Senile Chronic Insomnia Fu et al. e77 Quality Control Sample collector: A nurse in the hospital was assigned as the sample collector to screen samples and data in strict accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Thegrouping process was performed by a postgraduate stu- dent who did not participate in the whole process of the intervention in this study. The patients were randomlydivided into the control group and the observation group. Intervenor: Acupuncture treatment was operated by pro- fessional doctors in the outpatient department, and Gua-sha (scraping) treatment was operated by outpatient nurses who have been trained and assessed in the hospi- tal. In addition, researchers monitored the interventionquality by supervising the whole process. Data collector: Data were collected by outpatient nurses. Observation Index Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Score PSQI was adopted. The scale was evaluated from seven aspects that affect sleep by using the grading scoring meth- od. All the scoring criteria are 0 to 3 points, and the total score is up to 21 points. The higher the score, the worse the sleepquality. Clinical Ef cacy Evaluation Clinical ef cacy was determined according to Guiding Prin- ciples for Clinical Research of New Chinese Medicines.27 Recovered: sleep /C217 hours every day, the clinical symptoms basically disappeared; signi cantly effective: sleep /C216h o u r s every day, sleep quality and clinical symptoms were signi - cantly improved; effective: sleeping time is prolonged to/C202h o u r s \u00b7 d /C01; the clinical symptoms were only partially alleviated and the changes of insomnia symptoms were not obvious. Ineffective: clinical symptoms did not improve. ActiGraph (ActiGraph wGT3X-BT) was employed as objective evaluation tool to carry out the auxiliary detectionand monitor patients 'sleeping during the intervention. Acti- Graph is a noninvasive objective tool for assessing sleep quality. It can effectively monitor subjects 'sleep by recording their total sleep time and sleep ef ciency. 4The device is small and portable, easy to operate, suitable for long-time monitor, does not affect sleep, and so on. It is characterizedby high sensitivity, long detection time, easy operating, and a wide range of recording parameters. 28With the device, it is easy to record the elderly insomniac 's sleep conditions objectively and effectively. The results were eventually used to assess the subjects 'sleep status.Effective rate \u00bc(recovery \u00fesignicantly effective \u00fe effective) / n/C2100% Safety Evaluation Carefully record and handle adverse events, including abnor- mal skin conditions such as local hematoma, infection, allergy, ulceration, and blood scab during treatment; other diseases caused by participating in the treatment. Statistical Method SPSS 26.0 statistical software was used for analysis. Theresults of measurement data were represented by mean plus or minus standard deviation ( /C6s), and independent sample t-test was used for comparison between groups. Chi-square analysis was used to compare the classi cation data groups. Chi-square test was used to compare the counting data groups. The Wilcoxon signed rank-sum testwas used to compare the rank groups ( p<0.05). The differ- ence was statistically signi cant. Results Comparison of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Scores Before and After Treatment Between the Two Groups PSQI scores were signi cantly decreased in both groups after treatment. Compared with the control group, the differenceswere statistically signi cant ( p<0.01). After treatment, PSQI score of the observation group was lower than that of the control group ( p<0.01; Table 2 ). Comparison of Clinical Ef cacy Between the Two Groups The effective rate of the observation group was 85.7%, and that of the control group was 62.9%. The difference between the two groups was statistically signi cant ( p<0.01; Table 3 ). Discussion Therst description of insomnia in TCM was seen in Yellow Emperor 's Inner Classic (Huang Di Nei Jing) , where it was called \"unable to sleep \"or\"unable to close eyes. \"Insomnia is stated as \"not being asleep \"in modern TCM textbooks.29It is believed in TCM theory that its main pathogenesis is imbal- ance of yin and yang of Zang-fu organs, unharmonious qi and blood, which disturb spirit. The treatment of insomnia inTCM is usually based on syndrome differentiation, that is, to judge the relationship between insomnia and the de ciency Table 2 Comparison of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores before and after treatment between the two groups Group n Before treatment After treatment tp Control group 35 17.40 and Natural Products V ol. 3 No. 2/2023 \u00a9 2023.

Thegeneral principle is to supplement de ciency and purge excess, adjust yin and yang. In this study, it was found that the effective rate of the observation group was 85.7% and that of the control group was 62.9%, and the difference between the two groups was statistically signi cant ( p<0.01). PSQI scores of two groups were signi cantly decreased after treatment, and the differ- ences were statistically signi cant compared with the con- trol group ( p<0.01). After treatment, PSQI score of observation group was lower than that of control group (p<0.01), which shows that the effect of adding Guasha (scraping) and acupuncture is better than taking decoctionalone. Guasha (scraping) therapy is an external therapy of TCM. It is guided by the meridian theory and is characterized by easy operating, safe, and practical. 30Studies show that Guasha (scraping) combined with acupuncture can stimulate the human skin and muscle tissues, promote the circulation of human blood and lymph, stimulate peripheral nerves, sothat the muscle and peripheral nerves can be regulated, improve the changes in the body mechanism, and relieve the symptoms of insomnia. 31,32When there is speci c blood stasis in local skin caused by treatment afterGuasha (scraping), the skin and blood system changes. Therefore, pathogenic factors is eliminated, blood circulation is promoted, and the function of Zang Fu organs is improved.33It consequently restores the balance of brain excitement and inhibition, com-prehensively adjust the circadian rhythm of sleep -wake, and eventually cure insomnia. 34 The speci c point selection and acupuncture manipula- tion were from Professor Xiyan Gao 's35clinical experience, and the speci c acupuncture methods were adjusted accord- ing to patients 'insomnia symptoms. Acupuncture treatment of insomnia is characterized by safety with no adverse reactions. Acupuncture, through stimulating the selected points, can promote blood circulation, regulate nerves andbody fluids, affect and adjust physical functions of all tissues and organs. 36Some scholars treat insomnia with Guasha (scraping) and acupuncture and found that the combinationof these two traditional therapies can improve the symptoms of insomnia patients in different degrees. 13,32 Guasha (scraping) therapy is a long-serving clinical method. There is related content of Guasha (scraping) therapy in Fifty-two Prescriptions : a book written in the Warrior State period (476 BC -221 BC). It improves microcir- culation by improving the flowing routes of meridian, pro- ducing heat on the skin, and effectively stimulating a variety of hormone tissues in the human body. Properly applied, itcan effectively stimulate the human immune response and produce a benign reaction to the body. Guasha (scraping) haslittle adverse reactions, is simple and inexpensive, so it is favored in clinical treatment by medical staff and patients. 37 It is believed in TCM theory that human and nature are inseparable, and human physiological activities change rhythmically with the change of day and night. TCM empha- sizes the \"holistic concept. \"22,38,39With the in-depth clinical research on acupuncture, the Ziwu Liuzhu method has been explored and applied in clinical treatment.40Acupuncture during the corresponding time can achieve better ef cacy in treating insomnia.41In this study, two TCM therapies were operated in shen period (3:00 p.m. -5:00 p.m.) and youperiod (5:00 p.m. -7:p.m.) according to the Ziwu Liuzhu theory. Shen period corresponds to the bladder meridian, whose blood is sufcient and qi is insuf cient during these 2 hours. Taking advantage of this to subdue yang and enrich yin, extraefcacy can be obtained; Shen period is when yang fades and yin grows, treating during this period may help to enrich yin and nourish blood, subdue yang to keep it inactive.Meanwhile, spirit shall be calmed and kept in its \"house. \" As long as yang is subdued, spirit is settled. Moreover, bladder meridian helps patients to stabilize their mentalstate, calm them down and restore their emotion, regulate yang-qi, and eventually make them stabilized. The kidney is the foundation of congenital constitution. The elderly is decient in kidney qi and kidney essence. It is suggested in Essential Teachings on Diagnosis and Treatment that the elderly have dif culty in sleeping because of declined yang and yang failing to be enriched. Treating time is selected from 5:00 p.m. -7:00 p.m. when qi and blood are flowing through kidney meridian. It can improve sleeping condition by pro- moting kidney qi. Essence stored in the kidney is the basis of yin and yang of viscera, which can generate spirit whenessence qi in the kidney is suf cient. In addition, treating in youperiod can induce the patients to sleep because it is close to bedtime. Conclusion The above therapy has the advantages of simple operating, economical, and practical with little adverse reactions. It can signicantly improve the symptoms of chronic insomnia patients; therefore, it shall be applied clinically.
