Vaccinations, or immunizations , work by stimulating the immune sy stem, the natural disease -fighting system of the body. The healthy immune system is able to recognize invading bacteria and viruses and produce substances (antibodies) to destroy or disable them. Immunizations prepare the immune system to ward off a diseas e. To immunize against viral diseases, the virus used in the vaccine has been weakened or killed. To only immunize against bacterial diseases, it is generally possi ble to use a small portion of the dead bacteria to stimulate the formation of antibodies aga inst the whole bacteria. In addition to the initial immunization process, it has been found that the Effectiveness of immunizations can be improved by periodic repeat injections or \"boosters.\" Questions and Answers 1 Q: Where is the Medicare sourcing for coverage of the Hepatitis B vaccine? I thought it was covered for everyone. A: The CMS sourcing for a list of indications that support payment of the Hepatitis B series can be found in the Vaccination (Immunization): ICD -10 Diagnosis Code List attachment. 2 Q: Can I charge an administration fee? A: Yes. Administration fees for vaccines could be handled in the following manner: Part D vaccines, including the associated administration costs could be billed on one claim to the beneficiary or to the Part D plan. Note : CMS believes that Part D vaccines, including the associated administration costs, should be billed on one claim for both in - and out -of-network situations. Part D vaccine administration costs are a component of the negotiated price for a Part D -covered vaccine. 3 Q: When did CPT Code 90694 become effective? A: CPT Code 90694 became effective as a code with a status indicator of 'N' -non covered on 01/01/2020. On 07/01/2020 the status indicator changed to 'A' and is now considered covered.
