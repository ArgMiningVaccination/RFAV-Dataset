McMahon A thesis submitted in conformity with the requirements for the degree of Doctorate of Philosophy Institute of Medical Science University of Toronto \u00a9 Copyright by Dominique McMahon (2011) ii Regenerative Medicine Innovation in Emerging Economies: A Case Comparison of China, Brazil and India Dominique McMahon Doctorate of Philosophy Institute of Medical Science University of Toronto 2011 Abstract Regenerative medicine (RM) has the potential to develop new treatments for chronic disease and injury that are desperately needed in developing countries. Several emerging economies are actively participating in RM, producing new knowledge and initiating clinical trials. This thesis presents case studies of RM in China and Brazil and a comparative analysis of RM across Brazil, China and India. I aim to better understand the state of RM, how it has developed and what is needed for RM innovation to succeed within these countries. Case studies were conducted using face-to-face in-depth semi-structured interviews with RM experts from different areas including research institutes, hospitals, firms, educational institutes, government, iii policy agencies, and bioethics groups. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis and triangulated with the analysis of research articles, government reports, laws and other primary and grey literature. China is now the 5th most prolific publisher on stem cells in the world. Chinese RM benefits from permissive regulations and the expertise of Chinese returnees that have trained abroad, but the field's reputation is challenged by a weak regulatory system and the clinical availability of untested stem cell therapies. Brazil has created a small but strong RM program, but needs to address challenges to the field including inconsistent funding, slow importation of materials, and weak linkages between stake-holders. Comparative analysis of the three countries identifies several common elements that support RM, including linkages between stake-holders, government support, infrastructure, human resources, and good governance. RM capacity is clustered in large urban centres, which could exacerbate socio-economic and health disparities unless measures are taken to ensure equitable distribution of benefits. RM does not adhere to classical views of southern innovation, suggesting that new models are needed to describe innovation in emerging technologies, where countries are keeping up instead of catching up. iv Dedication: This thesis is dedicated in memory of Sara Al-Bader and her husband Mike Smoughton, two loving and vivacious individuals that were taken from us much to soon. Thank you Sara, my fellow student, travel partner, and friend, for all your support, criticism and inspiration. I love both and miss you, always. Acknowledgments I would like to thank my supervisors Halla Thorstiensd\u00f3ttir and Abdallah Daar, and thesis committee member Peter Singer for their guidance on this journey and for always keeping me moving; you have taught me more than I thought possible in a few short years. Thank you Halla, for your feedback and your friendship, both are precious. Thanks to my numerous friends from the MRC, in particular my fellow grad students Monali, Billie-Jo, Andrew, Mark, Rahim, Sara, Lara and Ken; I would be a long ways back without your academic and moral support. I also want to thank my family and friends who have put up with me and supported me no matter the distance. In particular, thanks to Roman Allemann and Master In-Kyung Kim and their families for their personal support during the duration of this work; you have kept me grounded and balanced along the way, which has been no small feat. All of the Indian interviews were selected and conducted by Bryn Lander and Halla Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir, a big thanks to them for the rich interview data that made my comparative analysis possible. My gratitude to all the experts in China, India and Brazil who generously shared their expertise and time: without them there would be no thesis. Thanks to Yi-lun (Sandra) Shih for her excellent translation services, friendship and help in China. This type of research is impossible without significant financial support. This research was primarily financed by a Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Net grant, and supported by the McLaughlin-Rotman Centre for Global Health. This thesis would have been a lot more challenging without the financial support throughout my PhD provided by an Ontario Graduate Scholarship, a CIHR Masters Training Award, and a CIHR Doctoral Banting and Best Award. vi Table of Contents List of Abbreviations and Acronyms............................................................................................xii List of

Recently, RM capacity has been identified in Brazil, China and India (Greenwood, Singer et al. 2006; Greenwood, Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir et al. 2006). These countries are developing competitive RM sectors involved in the research, development and commercialization of new therapeutics and services. This research project examines the dynamics of RM innovation in Brazil, China1 and India2 using country case studies. I aim to understand the state of RM research in these countries, how it has developed, and what is needed for the RM to succeed in these emerging economies. I pay particular attention to conditions that encourage or inhibit RM development and to the strategies or lessons that could help domestic RM further develop in these countries. 1 China refers to mainland China only, here and for the remainder of the thesis. 2 Here I conduct case studies of Brazil and China. I use data from a previously conducted case study of India for the comparison of Brazil, China and India. The Indian data was collected under the same project with the same methodology; further detail on how the data was collected, as well as how it is used here, is described in Chapter 3. 2 1.2 Research significance Developing countries3 face what has been termed a \"double burden\" of disease: while they are plagued by high rates of infectious diseases, developing countries also have large burdens of chronic disease - over 80% of chronic disease deaths occur in developing countries (World Health Organization 2005). So serious are the burdens of chronic disease and injury that the Word Health Organization refers to them as \"neglected global epidemics\" (WHO 2003). Recent initiatives, such as the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases, may help co-cordinate efforts against chronic disease in developing countries (Daar, Nabel et al. 2009), but there are simply no adequate treatments or cures for most chronic diseases globally. One emerging health biotech field may be able to provide new solutions. RM may result in better therapy for chronic disease and injury through the regeneration of cells, tissues and organs, but this technology is typically beyond the grasp of developing countries, which do not have the human resources, physical infrastructure, or financial investments to undertake this high-tech research and development. Several emerging economies have, however, been able to actively participate in the field of RM, producing new knowledge and promising clinical trials. These countries are the focus of this study. 3 Developing countries is used here as it is defined in the 2009 United Nations Human Development Report (United Nations 2009). This includes countries of \"high human development\" such as Brazil, countries of \"medium human development\" such as China and India, as well as those countries of lower human development. To acknowledge the higher economic and scientific capacity of China, India, and Brazil compared to those of lower capacity, the commonly used term \"emerging economies\" is used in this thesis. Emerging economies should be considered a sub-category of developing countries where rapid \"informationalization under conditions of limited industrialization\" have lead to rapid growth (Center for Knowledge Societies 2008). 3 1.3 An introduction to RM RM is a newly emerging field globally that aims to help the body to repair or replace injured tissues. Although the human body is able to heal small wounds and fight off some illnesses, it remains unable to self-recover from more extensive damage endured from trauma, old age and disease. In the last few decades, researchers believe that RM technology may eventually be the key to more extensive re-growth of damaged cells, tissues and organs. Stem cells retain the ability to differentiate into multiple cell types instead of being locked into a specific cell type - as are most of our body's cells. If this differentiation could be controlled or directed, stem cells could be targeted to repair, replace, or regenerate damaged tissues. Similarly, tissue engineering focuses on the regeneration of tissues and organs, often using a combination of stem cells with biomaterials or bio-artificial scaffolding. Other ways to induce healing may include induction of the body's own biochemical pathways through the use of hormones or other molecules. Another potential RM application is gene therapy, a method by which the body is provided with viral-like particles packed with the genetic information the body needs to promote healing or to replace lost function. RM is highly interdisciplinary and lies at the intersection of genetics, cellular biology, biomaterial engineering, computer science, chemistry, and medicine, among others. For the purpose of this project, I define RM as: \"an interdisciplinary field of research and clinical applications focused on the repair, replacement or regeneration of cells, tissues or organs to restore impaired function resulting from any cause, including congenital defects, disease, trauma and aging. It uses a combination of several converging technological approaches, both existing and newly emerging, that moves it beyond traditional transplantation and replacement therapies. The approaches often stimulate and 4 support the body's own self-healing capacity. These approaches may include, but are not limited to, the use of soluble molecules, gene therapy, stem cell transplantation, tissue engineering, and the reprogramming of cell and tissue types.\" (from Daar and Greenwood 2007, emphasis added) There is a global demand for RM products. The worldwide market for RM is conservatively estimated to be about US$500 billion, according to the United States Department of Health and Human Services report (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2005). This same report estimates the current world market for replacement organ therapies in excess of $US350 billion. RM thus holds potential to make an important economic impact in addition to its contributions to health. Despite the high demand for RM products, few have yet to reach market. Adult bone-marrow stem cells have been a front line treatment for leukaemia for over the last half century and have since been used to treat some other malignant and haematologic disease, but despite huge influxes of funding for RM, only a couple treatments for other diseases using these cells have been approved. A few first generation skin and cartilage substitutes have been marketed in the United States (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2005) and two gene therapy products have also been approved in China (Guo and Xin 2006). In addition to these products and therapies, a wide range of potential stem cell treatments are available for sale to patients in countries where proof of safety or efficacy is not demanded. These clinics accept both domestic patients and international patients that travel to these clinics to seek opportunities not legally available in their own countries. This highly controversial practice often called \"stem cell tourism\" has received considerable international condemnation in recent years, including from the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR), 5 BIONET4, and the United States FDA (Cressey 2009; 2009; Cyranoski 2010). Several countries have tightened regulation in order to oust opportunistic clinics. Costa Rica recently shut down several stem cell clinics, and Holland and Germany have taken steps to control this industry (Sheldon 2007; Stafford 2009; Carrol 2010). Additional regulations are purportedly being implemented to control stem cell tourism in Thailand, China and India (Qiu 2009). The clinical use of stem cells prior to testing is not the first controversy to cloud the path of stem cell research and development. Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research has been hotly debated in many countries including the United States and Brazil due to the need to destroy embryos in order to harvest their pluri-potent cells. Individuals of some cultures or religions view the destruction of an embryo as the destruction of a life. Biologically, the beginning of life is generally believed to begin much later - at least after 14 days post-fertilization, when the primitive streak begins to develop5 - but there is no cultural or moral consensus on when life begins. It is also still unclear to what extent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can be used therapeutically. While significant investments have been made in the United States for hESC research6, only one such clinical trial has been approved there. After being put on hold several 4 BIONET is a \"consortium of 21 EU and Chinese partners examining the challenges facing the ethical governance of research in the life sciences and biomedicine in China and the EU\" (BIONET 2011). 5 The primitive streak is seen as an opaque thickening band, and marks the initial differentiation of cells between different germ layer cell types within the body, the development of bilateral symmetry and the progression of the embryo from blastocyte to gastrula. Following the development of the primitive streak, the blastocyte can no longer be cleaved into separate viable cell masses -the process by which identical twins may be produced. The primitive streak begins to develop in humans around day 14 post fertilization and later develops into the nervous system of the organism. Because of these biological properties and others, the primitive streak was identified by the UK commissioned committee Warnok report as marking the beginning of person-hood. Most governments and international guidelines that allow embryonic stem cell collection use this14 day period prior to the development of the primitive streak to denote the limited period during which embryonic stem cell harvesting is acceptable. 6 Even though federal funding for hESC research has had numerous restrictions in the United States, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) still estimates to have spent about US$513 million between 2007 and 2010 on hESC research (NIH 2011). States may allow funding for activities that are not federally funded; California has invested about $US5 billion in stem cell research, with a priority towards funding hESC research. 6 times, Geron successfully enrolled its first patient in a human clinical trial of hESCs in October 2010. Research on other stem cell types is less contested. Adult stem cells have been identified in a variety of adult tissues including cord blood, fat, and dental pulp among others. Unfortunately, these cells are only multi-potent and do not have the full plasticity to differentiate into any cell type that pluri-potent ESCs have. Recent scientific breakthroughs have allowed researchers to create induced pluri-potent stem cells (iPS cells) using adult somatic cells, such as skin cells. This technology is still quite new and has not yet replaced the need for ESCs, but many hope they may eventually reduce or eliminate the need for cells derived from embryos. RM developments - including cloning, hESC debates, iPS cell creation, and stem cell tourism - have been hot media topics, generating a flurry of interest and investment. With this momentum has come significant increase in RM research. Over 30 new academic journals that focus on stem cell and related research have been created since 2004 alone, not including more general science journals that also publish frequently on these topics (Sanberg and Borlongan 2010). While most recognize the potential for stem cells, tissue engineering and gene therapy to revolutionize medicine, there are very few discussion of how this potential could be harnessed by developing countries to help those in need of new health solutions, nor is there significant discussion of the current activity of those developing countries which have already made significant investments and breakthroughs in this field7. 7 Evidence for this is provided in Chapter 2. 7 1.4 Objectives and research questions This study will examine how and why innovative RM has been developed in the emerging economies, using the following questions as guides: What is the state of RM in China and Brazil? Why are Brazil, China and India investing in RM? How have these countries built RM capacity and what conditions and strategies encourage RM innovation? What are their strengths and challenges with respect to RM innovation? What can we learn from the study of RM innovation across Brazil, China, and India? 1.5 Overview of the remaining chapters This chapter (Chapter 1) describes the significance of this research project, and introduces the field of RM. In the following chapter (Chapter 2), I will explore the literature that informs this study, focusing on our current knowledge of RM in China, India and Brazil, and on the innovation systems literature that forms conceptual framework behind this research. The results and discussion of this study will be presented in the format of academic papers. Each chapter will contribute focused introduction, results and discussion, and conclusion sections8. Due to the similarity of the methods across these papers/chapters, and in order to discuss the 8 Because each chapter is expected to stand alone, a small amount of repetition is necessary between chapters, for example between a chapter's introduction and the literature review; every effort has been made to minimize unnecessary repetition. 8 methodology in more depth, the research methodology is described separately in Chapter 3 instead of in each results chapter. The results of the China and Brazil case studies are explored in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 respectively. I discuss the current state of RM in China, as well as its strengths and challenges in the field. After discussing Brazil's main RM activities, I present some of the main factors that have made recent investment in RM attractive, as well as some of the current barriers to RM innovation. The results of the comparative analysis are presented in Chapter 6, where I explore some of the similarities and differences in the strategies used to develop RM. While each chapter contains a focused results and discussion section, a broader discussion is presented in the two chapters following the comparative analysis. Chapter 7 will describe the process of RM innovation and the RM innovation system in the emerging economies. In Chapter 8, I reflect on the characteristics of geo-centric RM capacity and its implications for health equity. My final conclusions and observations are outlined in Chapter 9. 1.6 References BIONET. (2011). Retrieved 12 March 2011, from http://www.bionet-china.org/about.htm. Carrol, R. (2010).

If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!' (Carroll 1962) 2 2.1 Introduction While I am not the first to make it, the above quote from Lewis's \"Through the Looking-Glass\" makes a poignant allusion to the difficulty with economic development created by international markets. Development is not just about innovating, it is also about innovating faster than everyone around you. For those countries with the capacity to compete globally, it may be increasingly important for their development to consider investing in high-tech solutions to local problems (in addition to other strategies), least they risk being left behind in the next wave of technological advances. One of the founders of innovation systems, B.A. Lundvall, suggests that world leadership in specific technologies may be appropriate for China, India and Brazil \"in order to avoid technological dependence\" (Lundvall, Vang et al. 2009). High-tech health technologies such as RM may be one of these key areas - not only would these countries develop competencies in a multidisciplinary field, building infrastructure and scientific knowledge, but 12 any products or services that result could have important positive externalities for their domestic populations. Here, I introduce the literature in two main areas relevant to my research: 1) the extent of our knowledge of RM in developing countries, and 2) the innovation system literature that informs the conceptual framework behind my research. I discuss what has been covered in the literature thus far, and identify the major gaps that call for an empirical analysis of RM developments in the emerging economies. I argue that innovation systems literature related to developing countries has focused too heavily on \"catching-up\" and has entirely neglected emerging high-tech fields in which developing countries may have a realistic chance of developing and maintaining a head start. This may be of particular importance for fields where innovation could have positive externalities for both economic and social development. 2.2 RM in developing countries The connection between poverty and health is clear. This link is illustrated in the WHO 1995 World Health Report: \"The world's biggest killer and the greatest cause of ill-health and suffering across the globe is listed almost at the end of the International Classification of Diseases. It is given the code Z59.5 - extreme poverty\" (World Health Organization 1995). Poverty impacts the ability for individuals, societies and nations to cope with the illnesses it faces in four ways: 1) poverty fosters the conditions that induce illness, including poor sanitation, nutrition and work conditions, 2) poverty impairs a countries ability to provide treatment and care for its sick, 3) poverty impairs a countries capacity to build the infrastructure, institutions, and organizations necessary to produce locally innovative health products and services, and 4) 13 poverty impairs the ability for countries to create the economic growth needed for citizens to escape the circle of poverty. Research suggests that if developing countries participate in the development of health biotechnology products, there is greater chance that products will be accessible, affordable and appropriate to their needs (Juma and Yee-Cheong 2005; Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir, Singer et al. 2007). This seems probable for RM too - bone-marrow transplantation (BMT) for currently treatable conditions may cost around US$20,000 in India's best hospitals, or about four to five times less than developed countries, such as the United Kingdom or the United States (Smith, Hillner et al. 1997; Chandy 2008; Chakraborty, Shieh et al. 2009). RM programs and research are readily visible in the North America and Europe, but as I show here, it is less clear what role developing countries have in the global development of RM. Here I present briefly the main literature available on RM in developing countries and show that while studies suggest RM may be a field of growing importance in China, India and Brazil, there has been no substantial discussion to date of why it has become an important focus of investment, how RM is developing, who is involved in this field, or how different players interact. 2.2.1 Two critical studies on RM in developing countries Initial studies exploring RM in developing countries conducted by Greenwood et al. resulted in two main findings: that there was both a need for RM technologies in developing countries, and that some countries had already begun developing RM capacity (Greenwood, Singer et al. 2006; Greenwood, Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir et al. 2006). These studies inform the foundations on which my research rests and are discussed in greater detail below. 14 Through consultation with RM experts from around the world, Greenwood et al. used consensus-building strategies to identify and prioritize the top ten most relevant applications for RM in developing countries, based on six criteria: burden, impact, feasibility, affordability acceptability and indirect benefits (Greenwood, Singer et al. 2006). The top-ranked responses include novel methods of insulin replacement and islet cell regeneration, regeneration of heart muscle, immune system enhancement, and tissue engineered skin substitutes. Nine of the top ten RM applications represent needed treatments for chronic disease and injury. The third ranked RM application addresses immune system enhancement and novel vaccination strategies, aimed at treating both chronic and infectious diseases. While this study does not compare these priorities to those of developed nations, it does identify the most pressing RM needs of developing countries - a topic otherwise unexplored in the literature. The second study by Greenwood et al. shows that developing countries not only have a need for RM technology, they are also actively pursuing these lines of research. In 2006, the authors profiled the RM activities of developing countries based on five areas of RM activity: 1) dedicated government funding for RM, 2) goods and services, 3) companies, 4) publications, and 5) academic institutions (Greenwood, Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir et al. 2006). Of the 154 developing countries, only 31 were identified as having RM activity. Of these, China, India and Brazil were found to have the most activity, and were the only ones with activity in all five investigated categories. This study provides a broad stroke understanding of the RM activities pursued by developing countries. It relies on information available in English collected via Internet key-word searches and thus can only capture those activities reported in this medium and language. The findings of this publication may then underreport the RM activities of some countries; nonetheless, it still 15 clearly indicates that Brazil, China and India are already actively pursuing this field. The authors identify only that RM activity exists for each of the criteria areas; they do not identify the level of activity or further explore the process of RM development, suggesting that more in-depth explorations of RM in developing countries are needed. The findings of both these studies are not entirely surprising. The large chronic disease and injury burdens of developing countries make it quite likely that RM therapies would be beneficial. Nor is it surprising that Brazil, China and India would be leaders of RM compared to other developing countries, given their higher economic growth and commitment to building scientific capacity. Nonetheless, these studies provide evidence that RM therapies are both highly relevant to these nations, and that these nations have begun making the investments and developing the infrastructure needed to bring RM innovation to fruition. In so, it justifies two assumptions behind my research: RM treatments are relevant to the emerging economies, and the emerging economies are interested in developing innovative RM treatments domestically. 2.2.2 Other important studies of RM in developing countries There are few papers that focus on RM developments in developing countries, and fewer still that have looked at how the RM sector has developed in these countries. Most literature instead focuses on one or more of three main themes: 1) governance, 2) ethical treatment of hESCs, and 3) the stem cell tourism industry. Most of these papers on RM in developing countries focus on China and India, but a few explore RM in other countries. For example, Harmon examined the moral controversy and legality of hESC research in Argentina (Harmon 2008). He concludes that there is insufficient governance of hESC research there and stresses the importance of developing comprehensive and morally grounded regulations. Another author explores hESC 16 research in Iran, discussing how the regulatory framework fits with Islamic law and culture (Saniei 2010). Of those papers on my three countries of interest, China and India focus more prominently, and several papers feature both. Brian Salter is one of the most significant writers about stem cell industries of China and India. He writes about the bioethical and governance structures for stem cells in these countries, and relates these to their developing bioeconomies (Salter, Cooper et al. 2007; Salter and Qiu 2009). He describes China and India's RM sector through analysis of a variety of economic and science metrics, and explores the role of policy and governance in shaping stem cell research and development. Salter's focus is largely on describing the market environment for stem cell therapies; the articles are industry centric, and lacks the innovation system and fieldwork based approaches that I employ in this thesis. They are nonetheless resources that make important contributions to our understanding of the RM landscape in India and China. A number of articles compared the permissiveness of embryonic stem cell regulations internationally, and delineate the stem cell regulations in Brazil, China and/or India, among other developing countries, but these papers do not explore the impact of these regulations on RM developments (see for example Walters 2004; Isasi and Knoppers 2006; Anant, Hongkui et al. 2008). Sleeboom-Faulkner and Patra also highlight RM in China and India in a provocative article focused on hESC research and regulations. The authors argue that China and India are functioning in a \"bioethical vacuum\", as a result of \"a rush to grab emerging opportunities\" in a \"hope to achieve economic success\". The paper also presents a number of allegations without supportive evidence, such as that human cloning is not supported because \"China has no need for 17 more people\" but that somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) research was supported because it \"seemed to promise more lucrative prospects\". These examples of the language and the accusations used, in my opinion, further highlights the need for empirically based analysis of the RM sectors of these countries. 2.2.3 RM in China In a drive to become an innovating country, China has placed increased emphasis on the development of domestic capacity, particularly in science based fields. The government's explicit aim is to \"boost innovation capacity\" and employ \"leapfrog development in high-tech fields\" to attain economic and social growth, and China has paid significant attention to the field of RM (Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China 2006). The extent of China's global contribution to RM is much debated in the literature. Some see China as one of the major players and a challenger to US hegemony in the field, where as others have described China as struggling in the field. Recognition for stem cell accomplishments in China increased around 2005, with several journals releasing news or perspective pieces focused on Chinese RM developments. Their titles, including \"Splicing Out the West\", \"Stem Cells \"Asia Jockeys for Stem Cell Lead\" suggest China as a rising power in the stem cell field (Dennis 2002; Yang 2004; Normile and Mann 2005; Guo and Xin 2006). These papers discussed some of the major developments within China, and some of its challenges. They serve as a good journalistic introduction to the topic and providing further evidence that there is important RM activity in these countries. However, these are not systematic or empirical reviews of the sector, nor do they examine in any depth the process through which RM has developed. 18 The RM accomplishments of China have been covered in academic journals primarily in the news or commentary sections - few publications contribute empirical evidence or data analysis. A news piece in Science in 2006 presents the development of the worlds two first approved gene therapy products in China (Guo and Xin 2006). One of these anticancer gene therapy products, Oncorine, was developed by Shanghai Sunway Biotech Co. and was approved for use in China in 2005 (Guo and Xin 2006). Sibiono GeneTech Co. in Shenzhen had the world's first gene therapy product, Gendicine, approved two years earlier for clinical use in head and neck cancer treatment. Gendicine has received mixed reception. Originally published in Chinese, specialists found that the English translations produced by Sibiono GeneTech of their publications were difficult to evaluate, and researchers have questioned the quality of the data and the transparency of the protocols (Peng 2005; Wilson 2005; Guo and Xin 2006). Confidence in Gendicine has been further compromised by the approval of the drug by the State Food and Drug Association of China (SFDA) without standard phase III clinical trial data (Guo and Xin 2006). Nonetheless, patients from around the world have gone to China to receive the treatment (Hilsum 2007). Two review articles also describe gene therapy clinical trials in China. One of these, written by then CEO of Sibiono Biotech, finds that regulation of gene therapy has became better aligned with international standards during the commercialization of Gendicine. There is no evidence presented to support this statement and this position, combined with his other comments establishing Gendicine as a leader in the field, suggest that the article may be biased towards Sibiono (Kim, Peng et al. 2007; Ma, Shimada et al. 2008). Several literature reviews and meeting reviews on RM in China discuss the specific scientific accomplishments China has had in stem cells, gene therapy and tissue engineering, or describe the research of a few key scientists (see for example Xiang and Spector 2002; Yang 2004; Guinn, Norris et al. 2006; Liao, Li et al. 2007; Cheng, Xiao et al. 2008; Liao and Zhao 2008). 19 These papers may help identify the research foci of individual researchers and contribute to our technical knowledge of research activities in China, from basic research to clinical trials. While this material does not focus on the development of the stem cell field as a whole, nor on the challenges and successes of this field, it leads us again to the conclusion that there is at least some quality research occurring in China. The dti Global Watch mission report is one of the few field-work based reports to evaluate scientific excellence in Asia, and covers China, Singapore and South Korea (dti Global 2004). Based on five days of fieldwork in China, it reports on the activities of a number of companies, hospitals, and firms. It concludes that the facilities they visited were equal or exceeded the quality of equivalent centres in the United Kingdom, and that the \"challenge to Western pre-eminence in stem cell science\" from China is real. Another author, Sipp, acknowledges the initial enthusiasm for stem cell research in China but believes that the initial investments have had little reward (Sipp 2009b). He describes Asian stem cell initiatives as having \"failed to live up to their early promise\", and suggests that of Asian RM investors, \"China in particular seems to be struggling\". His paper presents little evidence that Asia and China have had low productivity or have struggled in this field and his criticism of China is based largely on its publication output1. He states that \"America alone has generated nearly double the number of stem cell papers published by Asian labs\" between 2001 and 2009. While true, this comparison may be a bit unfair, as the United States far outcompetes every other country in the world - by at least 3.5 fold in 20092. Sipp identifies low rates of stem cell 1 Sipp's scientometric data was collected using a similar method to that I will use later to show China is a major player in this field - see the China case study presented in Chapter 4 for details. 2 Ibid. 20 patenting, weak regulations that allow stem cell tourism centres to prosper, and lack of intra-regional collaboration as hurdles for Asian RM3 (Sipp 2009c). The development of hESC regulations has been an important step in Chinese stem cell governance. D\u00f6ring writes in more depth about the medical ethics of China, covering both the historical context and current status of Chinese stem cell regulations (D\u00f6ring 2003; D\u00f6ring 2004). Regulations and ethics are the topic of several other papers, correspondence pieces and commentaries, most of which call for greater regulation implementation and enforcement in China (see for example Cheng, Qiu et al. 2006; Hennig 2006) Most of the criticism of China's stem cell sector is related to its stem cell tourism industry and the marketing of untested therapies4. Scholars call for tighter regulations in China and clinical evaluation of stem cell treatments will be essential for the field in China to regain international credibility (see for example Cyranoski 2007; Cressey 2009). Asian researchers themselves fear that stem cell tourism will adversely impact the international community's perception of their RM sector (Sipp 2009a). There is evidence this is already happening; the Sino-European bioethics network BIONET warns UK researchers of weaker regulations in China, and advise caution in collaborative RM endeavors between the two countries (Cressey 2009). The China-UK Research Ethics Committee known as CURE similarly advises that \"China lacks national 3 Note that while I list these hurdles by Sipp here, these - as well as his belief that Asian publication rates are low - are in reference to developments in Asia, and so are equally applicable to India. 4 \"Stem cell tourism\" is used here synonymously with \"unproven therapies\". Based on the way this term is used in the literature, it does not include the marketing of internationally accepted cell based therapies such as BMT for cancer or blood diseases, which are indeed marketed by developing countries to international patients due to their lower cost. While the term \"stem cell tourism\" is used to refer to those unproven therapies marketed internationally, please note that unproven stem cell therapies are also marketed domestically, and it is principally their unproven nature - not the international marketing - that has attracted the criticism discussed here. I use the term stem cell tourism even referring to locally available unproven therapies because it is easily recognized and repeating unproven therapies which are available commercially\" is cumbersome. 21 oversight of regularly compliance for medical research\" and \"any proposal involving the translation of stem cell research into clinical practice needs to be reviewed with great care\" to ensure that the lack of regulatory clarity \"is not exploited, intentionally or not\" (CURE 2009). Despite the lively discussion of the Chinese stem cell tourism industry, none of the studies discussed above claim to have had any face-to-face interaction with Chinese regulators, ethicists, or the stem cell therapy providers themselves. Only one Chinese RM study, to my knowledge, is based on face-to-face interviews with stem cell therapy centres. Chen explores three case studies of RM translation to the clinic, one of which is a case study of Shenzhen Beike Biotechnology, the largest unproven stem cell therapy centre in China (Chen 2009). Chen concludes that the absence of regulation has not led to a \"Wild East\" milieu, but instead to groups adopting \"individualized regulatory strategies\", and the tone of the piece is favorable to Shenzhen Beike Biotechnology. The methodology behind the case studies are not discussed outright, but it seems that the study is based on eleven interviews in total, which were conducted with representatives of each case. If so, the data collected may reflects only the views of those from each case study, and may neglect to include potentially opposing or critical views from regulators, ethicists and other researchers. While the details of this study are interesting and useful to our understanding of how these companies feel about themselves, they cannot be assumed representative of views in the wider RM community, and the conclusions of the study may be somewhat biased. 2.2.4 RM in India There is very little published on the RM sector of India, and most of the peer-reviewed literature focuses on the highly controversial clinics offering unproven stem cell therapies. Bharadwaj and Glasner have discussed the social and political aspects of stem cell developments using a ethnographic methodology, and focus their discussion on informed consent, moral implications 22 of in vitro fertilization (IVF) cell use, the development of a \"maverick\" stem cell industry providing unproven treatments, and socio-economic factors that could lead to human exploitation (Aharadwaj and Glasner 2008). Two articles by Patra and Sleeboom-Faulkner provide a comprehensive description of the stem cell therapy providers in India, based on a multi-site ethnographic study (Patra and Sleeboom-Faulkner 2009; Patra and Sleeboom-Faulkner 2010). The papers present stem cell therapy providers in India as functioning within a \"bionetwork\", which they define as an exploitive practice that takes advantage of unequal social contexts and manipulates the social and legal context for financial gain. The authors describe the stem cell regulations of India and several of the main unproven stem cell therapy providers, including those from public and private sectors, and individual practitioners (Patra and Sleeboom-Faulkner 2010). The authors conclude that the stem cell tourism industry in India is supported via regulatory inadequacies and lack of regulatory enforcement (Patra and Sleeboom-Faulkner 2009). It accuses stem cell therapy providers of preying on desperate patients and using unethical tactics, including falsified patient testimonials. The authors base their conclusions on empirical evidence collected through interviews, and are heavily critical of the stem cell therapy industry in India. Another paper, authored by CB Cohen and PJ Cohen, criticizes the stem cell distribution clinics of both India and Russia (Cohen and Cohen 2010). The paper describes the practices of several clinics in India as well as the regulations that are unable to restrain them. The authors do mention that legitimate stem cell research programs exist in India, but believe that while India may have the capacity to become a globally important stem cell innovator, they are loosing international credibility due to the nostrum therapies offered in renegade clinics. These authors and others call for greater regulation of the clinical use of stem cells in India (Jayaraman 2005; Chakraborty, 23 Shieh et al. 2009; Cohen and Cohen 2010). These authors represent both the international and domestic communities. For example, in a series of commentaries in the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics, author Pandya and one of the companies he criticizes discuss the legality and ethics of providing stem cell treatments to patients prior to evidence of their safety and efficacy. Pandya is critical of these practices, and documents a discord between the claims made by these companies and the evidence available in the literature, showing a need for greater regulation in India with respect to the clinical use of stem cells (Abraham 2008; Chandrashekhar 2008; Pandya 2008b; Pandya 2008a). While the literature on stem cell tourism in India presents an interesting perspective, the scope of these papers is limited to this part of RM activity, and so largely overlooks a legitimate stem cell research and development sector. A broader RM outlook is presented in a few news pieces of academic journals, which have noted growing Indian investment and activity in stem cell research (Jayaraman 2009; Sachitanand 2009). An online Indian business magazine provides a general understanding of the main centres and private ventures involved in stem cell research, as well as government investment and regulations (Dureha 2003). While journalistic pieces cannot provide a systematic or empirical review of RM in India, it does begin at least to identify the main organizations involved in the sector, and indicate growing activity and interest in Indian RM. A broader understanding of the Indian RM sector is also provided in a publication by Lander et al. (2008). The paper reviews first the current state of stem cell research in India, noting a steep increase in the number of stem cell publications. The authors describe the research and development projects pursued by the main RM actors in India, including research institutes, hospitals and clinics, companies and universities, as well as government policies and programs. 24 The authors identify four main requirements for India's stem cell field to prosper: 1) stronger linkages between those with basic and clinical research expertise 2) greater science education and stem cell training, 3) increased public awareness, and 4) a comprehensive stem cell research and therapy guideline. Alongside these, the authors discuss current programs and activities undertaken by the government to mitigate or overcome these challenges. This case study follows the same methodology as that used for the Brazil and China case studies I have conducted, and the data from this Indian study is used for my comparative analysis, presented in Chapter 6. While I agree with the analysis of the authors, I suggest that some important themes that cut across all three countries may not have made it into the main themes presented in their publication, and so the richness of the original data warrants further exploration in comparison with Brazil and China. 2.2.5 RM in Brazil By 2005, Brazil's Ministry of Science and Technology had invested US$24.7 million on stem cells, or about a tenth of its biomedical research budget, and in 2008, it dedicated funding for eight national stem cell technology centres (Leite 2009; Departamento de Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia 2010). Despite this interest and support for stem cells, there have been very few publications on Brazil's RM sectors in the international scientific literature. Of the publications that do exist, most focus on the legal and ethical debate around hESCs instigated by bio-security law of 2005 allows hESC research, but was subsequently challenged by Catholic groups on the basis that hESC research violated the right of all citizens to life. After a lengthy public enquiry by Brazil's Supreme Court, the law was upheld. An analysis of Brazilian newspapers at the time found that media in Brazil framed the debate in a mostly positive and 25 scientific way, despite the population's largely Catholic affiliations (Reis 2008; Jurberg, Verjovsky et al. 2009). While there have been numerous peer-reviewed publications from scientists in Brazil's RM sector5, few discussions of these developments have been present in the literature. A review of the stem cell research presented by Zatz may be the most informative review of the stem cell sector in Brazil (2009). Zatz reviews the current pre-clinical and clinical research in Brazil for heart, liver, diabetes, leukaemia, bone regeneration and muscular dystrophy. Despite the title of the article \"Stem cell Research in Brazil: Present and Future Challenges\", there is little discussion of challenges presented in the article, although the hESC debates in Brazil and the availability of unproven therapies internationally are mentioned. A news piece by Leite for the journal Science also includes a discussion of major accomplishments of two stem cell researchers who created Brazil's first hESC lines, scaled up hESC culture in bioreactors, and created Brazil's first iPS cells (Leite 2009). 2.2.6 The literature gaps: RM in the emerging economies Based on my review of the literature, there is little empirical research on the RM fields of China, India and Brazil, and fewer still that review the RM field as a whole or explore the process through which RM has developed. Much of the stem cell discussions have revolved around controversies - the stem cell industries of China and India and hESC debate in Brazil have been forefront in the literature on stem cells in these countries. Discussion of stem cell therapy industry in India and China overshadow discussions of the rest of the sector, potentially shaping 5 Evidence for this is provided for in the results of the Brazil case study, however hundreds of articles can also be easily confirmed by searching \"stem cells\" as a key word and \"Brazil\" as the author address. 26 our understanding of RM in the emerging economies into an unbalanced understanding of what is there and how it works. Despite this unbalance, the literature does suggest that these countries are increasingly active in RM and have made important contributions to the field - some even suggesting that these countries may challenge Western predominance in the stem cell field. As I have presented it, Brazil, China and India seem to favor stem cells above other forms of RM. This favoritism is a reflection of the literature; while I do reference some papers highlighting the tissue engineering or gene therapy sectors, the majority of credible information available about RM in these countries is about stem cells. This gap of information on other forms of RM could signify that there is little activity in other areas of RM, or that the authors themselves have been biased towards writing and publishing on stem cells. As I have pointed out, most of the coverage on stem cells has been on controversies in these countries, and so it is possible they could have won journalistic and academic interest and favor. Without further systematic research of the RM sector as a whole, and without exploring the extent and diversity of RM activities in these countries, it will be impossible to tell why other forms of RM have received so little coverage. Favoritism seems to have been paid to China and India in the literature as well. Some articles feature RM in both China and India, but none of these articles also feature Brazil. In fact, Brazil's RM sector is almost entirely absent from the literature. This conspicuous dearth of information could be due to any number of reasons. Perhaps it is because Brazil has stayed out of the stem cell tourism industry, and so has not received the largely negative attention of the 27 international stem cell community6. Brazil also has more restrictive hESC regulations compared to the other two countries - regulations much more in line with the Catholic cultural values held by the largest stem cell player and publisher, the United States, which may again have allowed Brazil's stem cell sector to remain in relative obscurity. It could also be an indication of much lower productivity in the RM field, compared to China and India. Without further analysis of the RM sectors of these countries, it is impossible to tell. Stem cell technology has developed in my countries of study despite a history of poor infrastructure and a comparative lack of resources. There is limited understanding of how this science-intensive capacity has been accumulated in these developing countries. While a few papers highlight accomplishments of the RM sectors in these countries, there has not yet been any discussion of how various groups active in RM innovation interact, such as the interplay between university researchers, firms, therapy providers, ethicists, clinicians and policy makers. These are issues I hope to begin to address in this thesis. The innovation systems approach I use in my research will help elucidate these interactions and relationships, and will better our understanding of what the RM looks like in these countries, and how and why it has developed. In the following section, I discuss the innovation systems literature that informs this conceptual framework. 6Actually, while there is no reference of a stem cell tourism industry in the literature, no article states that this industry is absent either. While I assume it to be true here, my case study of Brazil will later confirm that Brazil is not selling unproven stem cell therapies, or at least that any such activities are so small and insignificant to the sector as to have gone completely undetected by my research. 28 2.3 Introduction to innovation systems 2.3.1 Background The concept of innovation systems was introduced by Lundvall, Freeman and Nelson to describe trends in technological development in small industrialized countries (Freeman 1987; Lundvall 1988; Nelson 1988)7. There are numerous definitions for innovation systems; generally, the innovation system approach explores how new technologies are developed or adapted for a new context by examining the network of actors involved in the creation, diffusion and use of knowledge, as well as groups that support this process8. I use here a recent definition from Lundvall: The national innovation system is an open, evolving and complex system that encompasses relationships within and between organizations, institutions and socio-economic structures which determine the rate and direction of innovation and competence-building emanating from processes of science-based and experience-based learning. (Lundvall, Vang et al. 2009) Innovation systems in a broad sense9 encompass learning, innovation and competence building, and provides a \"systemic perspective\" that \"takes into account social institutions, 7 While these papers are the first to describe innovation systems, the original concept goes back to \"the National System of Political Economy\" by Friedrich List (1856), according to Lundval and Freeman, who provide a historical review of innovation systems in (Freeman 1995; Lundvall 2007a). 8 Identifying different definitions of innovation systems has been done elsewhere and is not within the scope of this review. For a list of select definitions from the literature, see for example Box 1.1 in (Lundvall, Vang et al. 2009). The definition of innovation in developed and developing countries is discussed further in section 2.2.6. 9 Lundvall argues that the narrower perspective of innovation systems - which equals innovation to science and technology and is aimed at mapping indicators of national specialization and performance - are of limited relevance and misleading to innovation system policy strategy(Lundvall, Vang et al. 2009). 29 macroeconomic regulation, financial systems, education and communication infrastructure and market systems\" (Lundvall, Vang et al. 2009). Several of the characteristics of innovation systems are described below. 2.3.2 Innovation system characteristics Innovation systems are dynamic. Innovation systems are based on an evolutionary economics perspective, in which complex interdependencies cause reaction and transformation from within the system (Verspagen 2005). Where classical economics assumes that firms are all perfectly informed and make rational choices based on a stable environment, evolutionary economics assumes that imperfect knowledge flows, uncertain environments, and feedback between elements results in a differentiation of firm competencies and productivity. Innovation systems are therefore continually dynamic and developing. Innovation systems are composed of institutions, actors, and the links between them. Innovation is the result of the interactive process between many factors, such as firms, research organizations, universities, labour force, financial institutions, and so on. It also includes institutions, which include regulations, laws, policy, habits, and social norms (Fagerberg 2005). The innovation system is composed of these links or interactions, between which learning and knowledge flows occur. Innovation systems are complex. Innovation systems are an alternative perspective to the linear model of innovation10, where stages of innovation are a simple and direct flow of knowledge 10 According to (Oyelaran-Oyeyinka 2010), linear model of innovation was generally accepted until Kline and Rosenberg definitively demonstrated its complexities in \"An overview of innovation\" (1986). This distinction is discussed in many introductions to innovation, for example (Fagerberg 2005; Oyelaran-Oyeyinka 2010). 30 from basic science research through to production and marketing (see Figure 2.1). Innovation systems involve more complex networks of actors, and the linkages and feedback loops between them. Where linear innovation reflects only new product innovation, innovation systems typically also include non-technical or intangible ones, such as product, process, and organizational innovations (Edquist 2005). A. B. Figure 2.1: Models of linear and system based innovation. Linear innovation (A) progresses across discrete stages consecutively. Innovation in innovation systems (B), as portrayed in (Mytelka 2000), occurs as a result of knowledge flows between a complex network of actors and institutions, including numerous feedback loops between them. Research Development Production Marketing 31 Learning is central to innovation. Lundvall proposes that \"the most fundamental resource in the modern economy is knowledge, and accordingly, the most important process is learning\"; this quote portrays one of the main assumptions on which innovation systems are founded (Lundvall 1992). Learning is the process by which new knowledge or new combinations of knowledge form innovation (Edquist 2005). It refers both to adaptation to new circumstances and competence-building through education and training (Lundvall 2006). It is through this learning process that competencies are built and innovation occurs; asymmetries in learning result in the differentiation of firm innovation and productivity (Lundvall 2007a; Malerba 2009). The innovation system approach is an important policy tool. The concept that innovation systems are important to policy development seems ubiquitous in systems of innovation literature. Policies matter because they facilitate the interactions between economic and non-economic actors, and policies need be designed in such a way that they \"get structures and institutions right\" (Lundvall, Vang et al. 2009; Oyelaran-Oyeyinka 2010). According to Edquist, innovation systems may both provide a framework to help identify specific policy issues and clarify general policy implications (Edquist 2001). The policy perspective draws attention to three key elements in the innovation process: learning, linkages, and investment (Mytelka 2000). The extent to which government action is required to stimulate innovation is much debated, but it seems clear that at least some government intervention may be needed to create conditions and opportunities for capacity building and to overcome systemic failures (Chaminade 2009; Cimoli 2009; Lundvall, Vang et al. 2009). The innovation system approach is influential. The innovation systems approach has gained significant acceptance in the last few decades, and has been endorsed by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), the Inter-American Development Bank, the 32 World Bank, and various United Nations agencies as well as government and non-government organizations in both developed and developing countries11. Innovation systems are context dependent. Innovation systems literature \"explicitly recognizes that policies need to be context-specific\" (Altenburg 2010). Scholars generally recognize that each innovation system's components may be influenced by the system's boundaries or scope (national, regional, or sectoral), and the unique characteristics of that system, such as culture, history and timing of the study. Thus, one \"cannot easily transplant a 'high performance element' from one system to another and expect the impact to be similar to what it was in the system of origin\" (Lundvall 2007b). In fact, to generate a general theory of innovation abstract from time and space would \"undermine the utility of the concept [of innovation systems] both as an analytical tool and as a policy tool\" (Lundvall 2007b). Furthermore, the characteristics of innovation systems in developed countries may not reflect those of their southern12 counterparts, and innovation systems within developing countries should, too, be considered heterogeneous and context dependent (Altenburg 2010). 11 Frequent references to innovation and innovation systems can be found on the websites and publications of these organizations and many governments. These particular organizations have also been cited as endorsing innovation systems by several authors and organizations including (OECD 1999; Lundvall, Johnson et al. 2002; Dantas 2005; Lundvall 2007b). Innovation systems have played an important role in the research and policy discussions of the OECD (reviewed in Lundvall and Borr\u00e1s 2005, box 22.1) China has clearly designed long-term science and technology policies using the national innovation systems perspective (Liu 2009). Arocena and Sutz (2000) have written that innovation and national systems of innovation play a fundamental role \"everywhere nowadays\", further attesting to the pervasive acceptance of innovation systems. 12 The commonly-used terms north(ern) and south(ern) are used to refer to developed and developing countries respectively. I acknowledge the term is imperfect - it awkwardly includes some developing countries such as China that are located in the northern hemisphere - but I use these terms here provide narrative variety, in conformity with the literature. 33 2.3.3 Setting boundaries The boundaries of an innovation system are perspective dependent and several systemic ways of looking at innovation have developed as subsets of the innovation system literature. Initial work on innovation systems was at the national level, also known as National Systems of Innovation (NSI) (Freeman 1987; Freeman and Lundvall 1988; Nelson 1988). This is in many ways an obvious boundary, as it encompasses regions within a set political border, and nations have both the capability and mandate to formulate distinct policies and regulatory frameworks designed to inspire and guide science and technology development. This NSI work inspired innovation studies using other geographic or political boundaries, including regional and supranational systems of innovation (for example, Edquist 1997; Cooke, Uranga et al. 1998). Other innovation systems literature focuses on specific technologies, such as for technological systems and sectoral systems of innovation (see for example Carlsson and Stankiewicz 1991; Breschi and Malerba 1997). Lundvall, one of the founders of the NSI, agrees that the future of innovation research lies in the details that cluster, region, and technology based innovation systems can help elucidate (Lundvall 2007b). I would add two more informal categories of innovation systems to those above, based on my review of the literature. Although not a system boundary per se, another clearly delineated subset is apparent within the innovation literature: those studies based on innovation systems within developed countries and those within developing countries. There, too, appears to be a distinction in the literature between high tech, low tech and traditional sectors. High-tech sectors are often associated with R&D intensive sectors (Fagerberg 1997), including science-intensive fields such as biotechnology (Pavitt 1984; Gem\u00fcnden, Ritter et al. 1996). In fact, biotechnology has been called highly representative of high-tech industries by several authors (Qian and Li 2003; De Luca, Verona et al. 2010). 34 These multiple subsets of innovation system studies help characterize the boundaries of my research. My research is focused on emerging economies, and so will be informed by studies of latecomer or developing countries, and will look at a specific emerging high-tech health technology. While the scope of this research project is sectoral - RM - I also rely on geographic boundaries to define the sectoral system. My initial scope is national, that is studies of RM processes and activities in the individual case studies of China, India and Brazil. The case study comparison could be considered supranational, making more general statements about RM innovation in these three emerging economies. As the project progressed, I realized that technological competencies in RM are largely regional or agglomerated into clusters. Below, I give a brief introduction to the literature on several of these topics or subsets of innovation, in order to familiarize the reader with concepts that either underlie my methodology and analytical lens, or which introduce aspects of innovation that will be important to the discussion following my analysis, near the end of this thesis. 2.3.4 Sectoral systems of innovation Sectoral innovation analysis is a broad, flexible and adaptable tool that enables both qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis across industries, countries and regions (Malerba 2009). Sectoral systems of innovation (SSI) can be generally defined as the network of actors and linkages between organizations and institutions involved in a particular technology or industrial sector. Malerba defines SSI as composed: \"by the set of heterogeneous agents carrying out market and non-market interactions for the generation, adoption and use of (new and established) technologies and for the creation, production and use of (new and established) products that pertain to a sector\" (F Malerba, as quoted in McKelvey 2001). 35 SSI may differ from technological innovation in that the latter focuses on generic technologies that may be used across several sectors or industries and which may not be in direct competition (Carlsson, Jacobsson et al. 2002). The scope or definition of a sector may be broad or narrow, depending on the goals of the analysis (eg, biotechnology versus RM versus hESC technology), sometimes referred to as the \"level of aggregation\" (Malerba 2002). Geographic boundaries are an important consideration for sectoral innovation analysis (Malerba 2002). While national boundaries may be used, it may be also appropriate to consider regional or small localized boundaries, based on how clustered technological competence and activities have become, and based on the scope or level of aggregation of the study (Malerba 2002; Malerba 2005). Similar to NSI, innovation in SSI involve a large variety of actors including firms, public or private research organizations, financial institutions, regulatory authorities and consumers (McKelvey 2001). Users and suppliers are important to the continuous redefinition of the sector's boundaries (Malerba 2005). While firms are central to the sectoral system, the most appropriate unit of analysis in specific sectoral systems is often individuals, who may be involved in several aspects of the technology (such as an individual who is both a scientist and an entrepreneur) (Malerba 2005). Institutions also play a large role in determining the nature of interactions between innovation actors. Some institutions may be national (such as many aspects of the regulatory environment or patent system); others may be international or even unique to that sector (Malerba 2009). Sources of technological opportunities may also differ: universities may play a large role in some emergent or high-tech sectors, in terms of research, human resource training, start-up firms, and innovation (Malerba 2005). Advancement in R&D, 36 advancement in equipment, and inputs of external knowledge sources may drive other sectors forward (Mazzoleni and Nelson 2007). Most sectoral innovation research has until recently focused on developed countries (Malerba 2009). There has been for several decades, however, belief that specific technologies may play an important role in the advancement of developing country economies. P\u00e9rez and Soete believe that certain technologies - or certain stages of a technology's development towards maturity - present developing countries with \"windows of opportunity\" to catch up (P\u00e9rez and Soete 1988; P\u00e9rez 2001). These windows of opportunity may be influenced via a number of factors, including through the creation of appropriate institutional frameworks, government policies and skilled human resources (Niosi and Reid 2007). P\u00e9rez and Soete believe that the \"crucial ingredient\" for the advancement of developing countries is to enter early into new technology systems, or they risk remaining stuck in a cycle of investing in mature technologies, steps behind the richer nations (P\u00e9rez and Soete 1988). While the authors discuss models of technology development and how to identify potential windows of opportunity, there has been little discussion in the literature of what innovation in these emerging technologies looks like on the ground. Interest in sectoral innovation in developing countries has in the last few years increased, as can be seen from the number of publications on sectoral innovation in the annual Globelics conference, and by the publication in 2009 of the first book focused on sectoral innovation in developing countries (Malerba and Mani 2009). In order to have an impact on markets, governments and corporations need to act early on, while there are still many paths down which the technology can progress (Niosi and Reid 2007). Discoveries made in the field can influence the direction and priorities of the field; without the contributions from emerging economies, their 37 strengths, resources and needs will not play part in the determining the development path of sectors such as RM. There has only been one study that has examined RM innovation specifically13. This study by Joyce Tait examined three biotechnology areas that are potentially disruptive innovations to the pharmaceutical industry: genetically modified crops, pharmacogenetics, and stem cells. According to Tait, the innovation system of stem cell therapies is \"in the early stages of evolution\" and there is \"no standard or well-defined progression of stages from the basic stem cell (from whatever starting point) through to the final therapeutic product\". Tait determined that the impact of stem cells to the pharmaceutical industry would depend on whether applications will be primarily in the public domain or whether they would produce a commercial product for large scale distribution. Stem cell innovations are difficult to patent, and regulatory regimes are still in initial stages of development. These conclusions are in line with sectoral innovation thinking: in biomedical industries, national health systems and regulations play a major role in the direction and speed of innovation (Malerba 2005). The scope of Tait's paper seems to be global, however it refers specifically to the USA and EU in several places and seems to omit discussion of stem cell technologies outside these zones. The conclusions do support the idea that innovation in the stem cell field may be unique compared to other biomedical technologies, which leads us to believe that more study of this field is needed. While there are no studies of RM innovation in developing countries14, biotechnology has been identified as sector of innovative opportunity by authors using innovation system frameworks 13 I including here neither the case study of India conducted by our research group nor the publications of material presented in this thesis because I am outlining here the literature gap that these papers will aim to fill. 14 Ibid. 38 (Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir, Quach et al. 2004b; Niosi and Reid 2007). These papers further point to Brazil, India and China as biotechnology leaders in the developing world. 2.3.5 Clusters and regional systems of innovation There is strong evidence that high-tech industries have a tendency to accumulate in geographic areas. Literature discussing the geographic concentration of high-tech fields comes from both literature on clusters and on regional systems of innovation (RSI). Clusters are geographically proximate accumulation of interconnected firms in a particular field, as well as other related organizations and intuitions including specialized infrastructure, customers, governments, universities, and think-tanks, among others (Porter 1998; Porter 2000). While some scholars may narrow their focus on clusters to the accumulation of firms in particular, I find the above definition useful, as it closely resembles that of the regional system of innovation. For example, Niosi and Banik define regional systems of innovation are \"geographical concentrations of interacting organizations\" including firms, research universities, and venture capital firms, among others, aimed at the development of a specific technology (Niosi and Banik 2005). Niosi remarks the similarity of this definition to that of clusters but uses RSI to identify clusters dedicated to R&D, as opposed to production or distribution. I choose not to use this distinction, and use these terms interchangeably within this thesis for two main reasons. Firstly, RM is still largely in the R&D stages of development, and so understanding the R&D processes of innovation is an important part of this study. I also study firms dedicated to production and distribution of untested therapies or of RM products for researchers, so both R&D and firm perspectives are important. Secondly, not all cluster literature in this discussion makes this distinction; using this distinction does not add to our understanding of this phenomena, and leaving it out does no harm. 39 Chiaroni and Chiesa identify two main categories of clusters: policy driven clusters and spontaneous clusters. Many biotechnology clusters are known to be spontaneous or self-organizing (Feldman and Francis 2002; Feldman and Francis 2004; Su and Hung 2009). Scholars have paid significant attention to how policy can help develop or support new clusters, but not all policy attempts to build clusters are successful (see for example Mytelka and Farinelli 2000; Enright 2001; Trippl and Todtling 2007). To address this, Enright has developed a more expanded taxonomy of current and possible clusters (Enright 2001; Chiesa and Chiaroni 2005). Some areas - which Enright has called potential clusters - may already have many of the competencies necessary to support the development of a particular field, but lack the critical mass to spontaneously develop. These are the areas that may respond to supportive government programs, funding and policies. Wishful thinking clusters are areas that fail to develop into cluster and are unresponsive to resources and efforts plied to them to force cluster development. The ability to differentiate between these types of clusters has obvious policy implications, and could have great importance to developing countries in particular, where better allocation of limited resources could have profound impacts. 2.3.6 Innovation in the developing countries Innovation systems were originally described based on a northern context, to describe developments in Japan and small Nordic countries (Freeman 1987; Freeman and Lundvall 1988), but there is growing interest in understanding how to apply the innovation system framework to improve policy and strengthen innovation in developing countries15 (see for example Gu 1999; 15 I stand by my original definition of developing countries, see note 3. While some authors subdivide out \"latecomers\" or \"fast-followers\" from developing countries, we do not make that distinction here. While I do 40 Arocena economic growth and technological catch-up is a major focus of developing countries, serious impediments to innovation exist (Mytelka Vang et al. 2009). Some authors have voiced skepticism as to how applicable innovation systems are to developing country contexts (Arocena and Sutz 2000), or if they exist at all. Both Viotti and Mathews argue for use of the term \"learning systems\" instead of \"innovation systems\" in developing country contexts, and Viotti argues that in stricto sensus, developing countries do not innovate (Mathews 2001; Viotti 2002). Lundvall acknowledges these arguments but supports the use of the term innovation systems nonetheless, as this term is widely prevalent in the literature (Lundvall, Vang et al. 2009). Sutz and other scholars studying innovation in developing country urge that there is at least a need to assess to what degree the original concepts around innovating systems apply in the developing country context al. 2009). Innovation is imperative for developing countries; according to Lundvall, \"learning and innovation is not a luxury but necessary and basic processes, which have to be parallel to and interact with poverty alleviation\" (Lundvall 2007b). Lundvall warns that \"standard indicators\" may not capture the reality of innovation systems and suggests that empirical work, likely involving on the ground questioning of firms, would be important (Lundvall 2007b). I would argue that Lundvall's assumption that firms are central to all innovation in developing countries is potentially problematic, and that initial studies of innovation in developing countries should recognize of course that emerging economies may have some unique innovation system characteristics compared to lesser developed countries, I intentionally keep the initial discussion of innovation in developing countries broad. 41 involve on the ground empirical work that explores the perspectives of multiple innovation systems actors, in order to better understand their roles and interactions. Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir, who has done considerable research on health biotechnology innovation in developing countries, has emphasized the importance of health systems to health based innovation by demonstrating that user-producer relationships encourage developing countries to focus on local health needs (Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir 2007). Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir et al. also shows the importance of political will for biotechnology innovation and the importance of linkages between innovation actors (Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir, Quach et al. 2004a). This systemic approach is further supported by the work of Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff who discuss the importance of governments and universities in innovation (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 2000), and Oyelaran-Oyeyinka, who discusses the central role of institutions in developing countries (Oyelaran-Oyeyinka 2006). Additionally, firms may play a smaller role in health sectors such as RM, where hospitals play a central role in the development and distribution of products and services. In conventional innovation system literature, innovation follows a narrow definition where breakthrough advances lead to \"new\" products or services, but broader definitions of innovation may be better suited to innovation in the developing countries (Ernst, Mytelka et al. 1998; Mytelka 2000). The definition of innovation used by Ernst includes not only new-to-the-world innovation but broadens it to include \"the process by which firms master and implement the design and production of goods and services that are new to them, irrespective of whether or not they are new to their competitors - domestic or foreign\" (Ernst, Mytelka et al. 1998). I employ this wider definition for inclusivity in this study, but this does not mean to say that new-to-the-world innovation is not occurring in Brazil, China and India - in fact, my case study results will show the opposite is true for their RM sectors. In all cases, innovation is accepted as distinct from invention. Invention refers to the occurrence of an idea for a new product or service, while 42 innovation is the process by which it is first attempted to be realized; the two may be separated by considerable time lag (Fagerberg 2005). Innovation has inherent to it the idea of economic or commercial value, and is usually produced by firms or hospitals (Fagerberg 2005). Of the innovation systems literature focused on developing countries, much has focused on latecomer or transitional economies, particularly those known as the Asian Tigers: Tiawan, Korea and Singapore. These Asian Tigers have succeeded in developing rapid economic growth and technological \"catch-up\". Several scholars have developed models to describe the process of innovation that firms in these transitional economies have followed; these are discussed further below. 2.3.6.1 Southern models of innovation The literature on technological change in low-income countries seems to suggests that the technological trajectory of developed countries is fundamentally different from that of developing or transitional economies. Several frameworks indicate that technologies are acquired from developed countries and then assimilated and adapted by developing countries (see for example Utterback and Abernathy 1975; Kim 1998; Wong 1999; Hobday, Rush et al. 2004) One model for technological change in the South is Kim's model of technological development (Kim, 1998, Kim 1999). Kim adapts the Utterback model to better reflect developing country advancements, and describes developing country innovation as a process of acquisition, assimilation and improvement. By acquiring mature \"packaged\" technologies including all manufacturing know-how, latecomer countries can \"acquire\" technology. Then follows a period of process innovation, in which competition between new entrants encourages improvements in the manufacturing process to improve and differentiate products. Some firms may acquire 43 enough indigenous capacity through this process to make innovative improvements to the originally imported mature technologies and become internationally competitive. This process is opposite in many respects to the process of development in the North, and is sometimes referred to as reverse engineering. Lee and Lim describe different models of catching up based on selected Korean industries (Lee and Lim 2001). The models they describe include 1) path-creating catching up, path-skipping 2) catching-up and 3) path-following catching up. In the first two models, the developing country is able to \"leap-frog\" ahead by skipping steps that previous entrants went through, whereas the third is more similar to the Utterback model, depending on \"duplicative imitation\" followed by \"creative imitation\". Wong, another author interested in describing southern technological development, similarly describes the innovative process of emerging economies from the perspective of the late-comer, but highlights potential differences in the way these late-comer firms react and develop (Wong, 1999). Wong argues that similarities between emerging economy developments are over emphasized, perhaps owing to the focus of most literature on sectoral innovation within the IT and electronic industries. To illustrate this point, Wong describes the rapid industrial and technological catch-up of Korea, Taiwan and Singapore and highlights the differences in their rapid capability development. Wong introduces five models of development that differ in the extent and speed of innovation in the manufacturing process and final product. Wong includes models similar to Kim's, but also describes models in which process innovation is the key goal, or where product innovation occurs in tandem to process innovation. Wong stresses that firms in these emerging countries will evolve different strategies that play to their unique strengths and resources than would be developed by latecomer firms in advanced countries. He first describes 44 several general first mover advantages: early capture of consumers, capture of key resources, and learning curve effect. In addition to the absence of these advantages, latecomer firms in emerging economies suffer from distance from users, distance from leading sources of technology, and shortage of specialized input resources/infrastructure. Latecomer advantages for late industrializing countries include lower resource costs, sheltered markets, and information asymmetry. Knowledge flows from north to south are larger than knowledge vice versa, owing to the knowledge on developing country firms being less accessible or locked in local languages (Wong 1999). Many others have also explored the difficulty of developing technological capacity in emerging economies. For example, the transition dilemma between the 'catch-up' phase and true leadership is explored by Hobday et al (2004), who notes that innovating is a costly process by which firms may begin to challenge previous contracting partners and clients. Ernst has explored on the innovation system of developing countries by studying the international networks that allow the import of mature technologies for reverse engineering (Ernst, 2002). The key similarity between all of the frameworks described above is that the focus is on how latecomers to a field become involved in the eventual creation of new knowledge, while playing down their particular disadvantages and leveraging their strengths. This is the sticking point of all these models in terms of their applicability to new emerging high-tech fields, such as RM innovation in emerging economies. The above models are dependent on the initial transfer of mature technologies from the North to the South, and although most industries in emerging economies are likely to follow this route, some specific sectors may take a much more proactive approach. In RM, there are no available mature technologies or products to import, and firms are not yet \"latecomers\" to the market. Instead, these countries aim to be at the forefront of RM from 45 the beginning. This agrees in concept with Lander's analysis of RM in India. In a conference, Lander indicated that RM innovation in India may differ from the reverse engineering model that makes up the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries of these countries, marking a shift in India's life science innovation paradigm (Lander and Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir 2006). New research will be needed to explore how innovation in RM or other high-tech fields occurs in emerging economies. All of the above models are designed to describe the characteristics of innovation strategies that helped the Asian Tigers and a few other countries in catching up with more industrialized nations during a specific period of time - largely in the electronics and manufacturing sectors. There may be less room for countries to engage in the old models of technological catch up now (Lundvall, Vang et al. 2009). Reverse engineering and imitation based strategies that were the stepping stone of the Asian Tigers are now impaired by stronger patent rules, greater fiscal prudence, and the removal of international trade barriers (Lundvall, Vang et al. 2009). Luckily for emerging economies and other developing countries, there are \"multiple generic evolutionary paths for rapid tech catch-up\" (Wong 1999). I propose here that one of these paths could be new emerging technologies, such as RM. According to Wong, there is a tendency within the innovation literature on the Asian Tigers to focus too much on their common characteristic and undervalue their differences (Wong 1999). We risk doing exactly this if we do not fully take the opportunity to explore how innovation occurs in emerging technologies in developing countries, and how today's regulatory, financial and political environments impact the process of RM innovation. 46 2.3.7 The literature gaps: innovation in developing countries Innovation systems are a way to look at complex systems to help us understand how some economic systems excel and are able to harness new technologies. There is understandably great interest in applying these ideas to developing countries, where economic growth is desperately needed. Innovating in developing countries is challenging; limitations to infrastructure, firm learning, and appropriate institutions are major barriers to innovation. Innovation systems can provide both a valuable analytical and prescriptive tool for policy-making (Arocena and Sutz 2000), especially where there is already a critical mass of relevant actors. Studying these innovation systems can identify failures and imbalances within a system, and can help devise interventions that take into account the needs and strengths inherent to a specific system. In developing countries, institutions and policy initiatives must be designed for the system in mind, and cannot simply be imported from other systems (Arocena and Sutz 2000). This requires significant study and understanding of the innovation system of interest. There are two main identifiable gaps to our understanding of developing country innovation systems: 1) lack of understanding of poverty-reducing innovation, 2) lack of understanding of emerging technologies in developing country contexts. Innovation systems in developing countries have important implications not only for economic growth, but also for how economic growth impacts development, yet literature focused on innovation systems in developing countries has largely failed to addressed the specific need for poverty-reducing and socially inclusive innovation. This is a gap acknowledged within the literature itself (Lorentzen and Mohamed 2009; Altenburg 2010). Technologies such as RM have enormous potential to transform health systems for the better - which may induce positive 47 economic, social and health outcomes. On the other side, emerging technologies are often initially expensive, and so have the power to further divide the rich from the poor (Cozzens 2009). The degree to which RM innovations impact health systems will depend to a large extent on how the system develops. These innovation systems may be influenced by policy initiatives, yet we are poorly equipped to understand how to harness or direct their potential. The existing literature on innovation in the South on established technologies does not sufficiently capture the innovative process of an emerging high-tech field. P\u00e9rez has indicated the importance of developing country participation in emerging technologies, yet there is little innovation system research on the ground, particularly in new high-tech fields. Developing country innovation has been thus far described from a latecomer perspective, suggesting that high-tech fields where reverse engineering is not possible may develop differently than the strategies thus far discussed in the literature. Northern innovation models and historical models of transitional economies are also likely to be ill suited to describe the RM sector in Brazil, China and India, given their unique environments and emerging country characteristics. More research is thus required to determine the processes of innovation in emerging fields such as RM in these countries. 2.4 Conclusions In my opinion, too much of the literature on innovation in developing countries has been focused on catching up - or at best, keeping up. It seems that a discussion around getting ahead or staying ahead has been prematurely dismissed in discussions focused on specific technologies or sectors. While the national innovation system of developing countries may generally be in need of catching-up, there have been successes in some sectoral systems in getting ahead. That is, in fact, the process by which several Asian countries have risen up. Certain developing countries, 48 too, have excelled in niche areas including health biotechnology by applying innovative business models, devising novel products and services, or by designing new production processes (Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir, Quach et al. 2004b; Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir, et al. 2008; Rezaie, Frew et al. 2008). Although it is obviously costly and risky to build innovation in a new high-tech market where limited science and technology knowledge and infrastructure are available, the review of literature on the RM sectors of these countries show it is far from impossible. There is initial evidence that RM programs are needed, exist, and are excelling in Brazil, China and India. As RM is a nascent field, innovation processes here must then take a unique path where technological developments are largely independent of foreign transfer into the country and that take into account the unique barriers and advantages imposed by the economic status of the country. In order to understand is innovative process, a systemic view of RM innovation is necessary. Further study will be needed to determine the characteristics of this process, as well as the extent to which this innovation can lead to positive economic and social impacts. Just as Alice and the Queen run and run but never seem to get ahead in the quote that begins this chapter, countries that aim only to catch up may find themselves again behind as new emerging technologies replace current ones - without pursuing leading-edge fields these countries may not get anywhere at all. This thesis will explore the extent to which Brazil, China and India are engaging in the field of RM - a globally emerging high-tech field of biomedicine. It is my hope that the results of this study may help to contribute to a wider understanding of innovation processes that are occurring in developing countries. 49 2.5 References Abraham, S. J. K.

I then describe the collection and analysis of my interview and secondary data sources. The validity of my findings, the limitations of the study, the ethics protocols followed, and the dissemination strategies used are also discussed at the conclusion of this chapter. 3.2 Choice of methods 3.2.1 Case study research This research employs a case study approach composed of primarily qualitative research methods mixed with some quantitative analysis. According to Yin (2008), case studies allow the empirical study of a contemporary phenomenon, and is particularly suitable when there are many variables outside of the researchers control. Case studies are typically organized around a small number of research questions, bounded by the defined case (Stake 2000). My research questions, presented earlier, focus around RM innovation - a complex and real-time process of technology 67 development - bounded principally by my countries of study. The historical, political and cultural contexts of each country produce innumerable variables that affect RM innovation. Case study methodology is often used for policy or social science orientated research (Yin 2008), further making it suited to this study. Qualitative research is increasingly recognized for its ability to provide insights on social behavior, grounded in the experiences of those affected by or contributing to policy decisions (Ritchie and Spencer 2002). The primary data source for this project is semi-structured key informant interviews, a typical approach in policy oriented case study research (Ritchie and Spencer 2002; Yin 2008). During semi-structured interviews, the researcher is allowed to probe a new topic or to ask follow-up questions, allowing for greater flexibility during the collection of data. Key informants often reveal information in an interview that they would not disclose on a questionnaire, creating a richer data set than would be possible with a questionnaire or survey (Sorrell and Redmond 2008). A major strength of case study research is that it allows researchers to use multiple data sources, helping to establish the reliability and validity of the results (Yin 2008). Most often, qualitative analysis includes interviews and document analysis (Janesick 2000). The additional sources of qualitative data used in this study include the following: documents from primary and grey literature, academic papers, policy and regulatory documents, laws, government reports, field notes and memos. The combination of qualitative and quantitative data can make for a strong analytical strategy in case study research (Yin 2008). Quantitative data sources - including relevant published statistical information, scientometric data on RM publications, and analysis of patenting trends - also contributed to the findings of this study. 68 3.2.2 Research perspective Case studies are presumably designed based on theoretical prepositions, which shape the data collection and analytical strategies (Yin 2008). This study uses innovation systems as the underlying conceptual framework. While case study research may contribute to theory, its primary purpose is not typically theory building1 (Stake 2000), and so this research is not designed to test or explore a particular aspect of innovation system theory in and of itself. Innovation system literature has, however, helped shape the design and scope of this case study. Based on our understanding of learning in the innovation system, I assume that many types of RM stake-holders will influence the creation, diffusion and use of RM knowledge. Instead of only studying the role of one major stake-holder, say researchers or firms, I have decided to explore the perspectives of multiple types of RM stake-holders to create a broader understanding of how RM has developed in the emerging economies. Typical actors identified as being active in biomedical innovation in developing countries include the following: firms, universities, research institutes, hospitals, government agencies, patent offices, regulatory agencies and funding organizations (Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir, Quach et al. 2004; Dantas 2005). In addition to these, I also identified other innovation actors potentially important to RM specifically: bioethicists, animal model experts, stem cell source institutions such as cord blood banks and fertility clinics, and firms that provide specialized supplies or services for RM researchers. While the primary objective of this research is not to study innovation systems, this methodology will allow us to reach conclusions that may help inform the innovation system literature about the development of these high-tech health products in low resource settings. 1 With the exception of some research based on grounded theory methodology. 69 3.2.3 Case study selection This research project explores RM in Brazil and China, and compares the case study data of RM in Brazil, China and India. The justification for the selection and comparison of these cases is discussed below. These cases were chosen based on a previous study at the McLaughlin-Rotman Centre for Global Health that identified only these three countries as having RM development across five major activities: 1) dedicated government funding, 2) goods and services, 3) companies, 4) publications, and 5) academic institutions (Greenwood, Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir et al. 2006). Based on the results of this study, China, India and Brazil seem to have sufficient development in RM to warrant further detailed research. The Brazil and China case studies are presented fully in this thesis. The Indian RM case study was completed by other researchers in our team, and so it is not presented here2. The Indian case study uses the same general research design and the original Indian RM interview data was re-analysed for the comparison of India with China and Brazil. 3.2.4 Case study comparison Case study comparison helps to determine the common and unique characteristics of each case and allows the researcher to begin to understand and assess the generalizability of the data, or how these results can or can not be applied to other external situations (Yin 2008). Brazil, China and India make an interesting case study comparison because of their geo-economic similarities and cultural, social, and political differences. Often classified as \"emerging economies\", Brazil, 2The findings of the Indian case study are presented here: (Lander, Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir et al. 2008) 70 China and India have higher growth and per capita incomes than many of the other developing countries, which allow them to make comparatively large investments in science and technology. All three countries are also geographically large and represent large populations. Despite these similarities, these countries have widely differing political, social and cultural systems. These similarities and differences will likely affect the processes of innovation in these countries, particularly with respect to the influence of legal, social, religious, and cultural factors on the development and adoption of new RM technologies.3 3.3 Primary data collection 3.3.1 Scoping exercise I began by conducting an informal survey of the RM sector using information and sources available online, including organization and firm websites and searches in academic publication databases. This exercise helped me to form a preliminary understanding of the RM sector for each country, including events that affected RM development, major laws and regulations that impact RM, and examples of innovative research being conducted by each case country. It also was used to identify the network of individuals and institutions involved in the creation, diffusion and use of RM knowledge. 3 For example, where Brazil was locked for three years in a legal debate with the Catholic Church over the constitutionality embryonic stem cells research, China's Confucian population finds the same research largely uncontroversial. 71 3.3.2 Key informant selection This research relies on expert or key-informant based sampling, meaning that all the interviewees were selected based on their expected ability to provide expert information on the specialized topic being studied (Luborsky and Rubinstein 1995). Potential key informants were selected using a combination of purposeful, snowball, and gatekeeper-mediated sampling methods. Purposeful selection entails the researcher identifying and choosing potential participants based on selection criteria relevant to the research objective, and is the most common sampling strategy in non-probabilistic samples (Guest, Bunce et al. 2006). All selected participants resided in the country of study and were selected based on our knowledge of their RM expertise from the scoping exercise described above. Purposeful selection can also be used to ensure the participation of individuals that have certain attributes (Berg 2004), and it is by saturating across different groups that researchers can begin to build their conclusions (Glaser and Strauss 1967). I selected key informants to represent perspectives from across the three main types of RM: gene therapy4, tissue engineering, and stem cell therapy. I selected key informants based on their involvement with various stages of RM development as well: basic researchers, clinical researchers, product developers, and therapy providers were included. Participants also were selected to represent different geographical areas across the country of study that seemed to 4 Due to the limited number of gene therapy contributors, several interviewees were included for gene therapy research and development that, in the strictest sense of our definition, may not qualify as regenerative medicine. For example, the gene therapy product for head and neck cancer developed by Sibiono, Gendicine, results in the destruction of cancerous cells. This therapy inserts a naturally occurring \"self-destruct\" gene, into malignant cells, causing their destruction. While this allegedly cures disease and allows healthy tissues to grow and restore functionality, it occurs through the destruction of tissue, not regeneration. The technology itself, however, is identical in technique to those that would be considered regenerative, such as the insertion of a missing gene that would lead to restored ability to produce a specific enzyme, and restores the cells and tissues to a normal healthy condition. We include such technologies in the study because there would be no difference to the innovative process being studied. Several other projects that I have seen presented in conferences have also included this type of gene therapy as regenerative medicine, including here: (Morrison 2010). 72 represent densities of RM activity. These sampling methods ensured that each group's opinions and experiences contribute to the development of a multi stake-holder perspective of RM in the case countries. During the interviews, I asked participants to identify other domestic experts in RM, particularly for stake-holder types I felt were not yet sufficiently represented - a strategy known as snowball sampling (Berg 2004). For example, Chinese government representatives for relevant agencies were difficult to identify through the scoping exercise alone, so I would ask participants if they could recommend individuals in these agencies. By asking participants to identify those important to RM, I was also able to verify that I had identified all relevant stake-holder groups and important individuals during the scoping exercise, or to identify and fill any gaps in this information. Where I could not identify a suitable key informant, I used recommendations of a gatekeeper who had not been interviewed to gain access to potential participants. Gatekeepers are individuals that can facilitate or restrict access to potential participants (Holloway and Wheeler 2002). For example, several government agencies have international cooperation offices that could recommend relevant participants. Other times, the Canadian Embassy within the studied country helped me to identify the proper individuals to contact within government agencies. Sampling in qualitative research continues until theoretical saturation is reached, which is when no new themes seem to be developing and it seems little new information is being generated that develops the properties of a category or theme (Glaser and Strauss 1967). Small numbers of interviews are often sufficient to begin building interviewee consensus, and as few as six interviews can generate themes and elements of meta-thematics (Guest, Bunce et al. 2006). Based on the McLaughlin-Rotman Centre for Global Health experience conducting similar type 73 research examining health biotechnology in seven developing countries (Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir, Quach et al. 2004), I suspected around 25-40 interviews per country would be necessary to reach theoretical saturation and budgeted time and resources accordingly. By using the purposeful, snowball, and gatekeeper-mediated sampling methods described above, I was able to generate sufficient participation to reach theoretical saturation in each country (the number of people interviewed in each country are available in the field work summaries below). 3.3.3 Conducting key informant interviews Purposefully selected interviewees were contacted initially by email with a letter of invitation to participate in the study that described the purpose of the study and what their participation would involve (see Appendix A). Follow up emails were sent a week later and potential participants were contacted by phone if there was still no response. Snowball sampled participants were contacted either by phone or email, depending on the available contact information. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with consenting key informants. Interviews ranged from about 40 minutes to 2.5 hours, but were typically 1-1.5 hours in length. Interviews began by obtaining informed consent of the participant, described further in Section 3.7. Interviews were conducted in a quiet place of the interviewee's choice, typically either in their office or an alternative location such as a quiet caf\u00e9 or hotel business meeting room, depending on the preference of the interviewee. Interviews were conducted in the language of choice of the participant. Most participants were comfortable conducting the interview in English but translation was provided when needed or preferred (one translator was used per country). I also conducted two interviews in French, at the participant's request. Occasionally, interviewees invited additional people to participate in the interviews. Where more than one participant was interviewed at once, consent was obtained from each individual and questions could be answered 74 by either or each participant. These additional participants that consented and contributed to the interview were formally counted as an interviewee5. 3.3.3.1 Interview topics Interviews were semi-structured in nature and were directed by pre-prepared interview guides (for example, see Appendix B). The interview questions explored current RM research activity including available funding, regulation, and relevant policy initiatives. Other questions examined current strengths and barriers to RM research and development, the future potential of the field, and the wider socio-political context of RM R&D for each country. The semi-structured nature of the interviews allowed me to depart from the guide and explore topics that arise over the course of the interview, and allowed me to pose questions relating specifically to an individual's expertise. I re-worked the interview guides over the course of the field-work to revise questions that were not working, to remove questions that had reached saturation, to add questions that arose during earlier interviews, and to tailor interview guides to particular stake-holders. While I maintained control over the direction of the interview, the format and order of the questions remained flexible to maintain a natural conversational flow. Questions asked in the Brazil and China RM interviews were very similar to those used in the India case study, which was completed first. Consequently, I had a high degree of confidence in the interview guides and did not conduct formal pilot interviews. Two interviews with Chinese representatives were conducted in Toronto at a conference prior to fieldwork in Brazil or China. 5 Several of these additional participants did not contribute any usable information to the interview and were not counted as participants so as not to inflate our participation numbers. Some of these uncounted \"participants\" preferred not to sign the consent form as they indicated that they felt they had not contributed; no information was used from participants that did not consent. 75 This allowed me to informally test of the interview guides prior to departure; no changes to the guides were required. 3.3.3.2 Generating interview transcripts Interviews were transcribed verbatim, either outsourced or transcribed in house. Most of the transcription occurred upon return to the University of Toronto, although some transcripts were initiated in the field. I verified all transcripts that I had not personally transcribed for accuracy. The quality of the transcripts I had transcribed was verified using random spot-checking. For interviews that included translation to/from English, the English portion of all translated interviews was transcribed. A bilingual researcher or research assistant attested to the quality of the translation for several full transcripts and for spot-checks of the remaining transcripts. 3.3.3.3 Field-work summary: China Interviews were conducted with 47 consenting participants from a broad spectrum of innovation organizations (see Table 3.1) 6 and across several cities: Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Changsha, Guangzhou, Chonquing, and Shenzhen. Interviews were conducted in China over two field trips in the Summer and Winter of 2007. We found interviews with high-profile individuals difficult to obtain by junior researchers in China. Consequently, both McMahon and the research supervisor Dr. Halla Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir were present for the Chinese interviews. Following an initial training period, I took the lead on the interviews. 6The characteristics of our interviewees - including the cities and institutions they represent - are further discussed in the results chapters of each country. I touch on the interview demographics here only to provide the reader with a better sense of the extent of the fieldwork conducted in each country. 76 Table 3.1: Number of experts interviewed in each organization type in China. Type of organization Number University 7 Institute 6 Hospital 6 Firm 8 IVF/CBB 6 Policy 5 Funding 4 IP 5 Total 47 CBB: Cord blood bank; IP: Intellectual property; IVF: In vitro fertilization clinic. Interviewees were from seven cities across China corresponding to most of the main RM hubs in China: Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Chonqing, Changsha, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou. Our initial interviews indicated that the source of embryos and RM supply actors were important to RM in China and so interviews included representatives of cord blood banks, IVF centres, and researchers investigating animal models for RM research. 3.3.3.4 Field-work summary: Brazil All interviews were conducted with 50 consenting participants over a seven-week field-trip in November-December of 2008. I conducted interviews in Brazil on my own, with the exception of three interviews with government agencies in Bras\u00edlia, for which Dr. Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir was present. Interviewees represented a broad range of RM innovation actors (see Table 3.2). Interviews were conducted in the following cities: S\u00e3o Paulo, Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Rio de Janeiro, Petr\u00f3polis, Salvador, Belo Horizonte and Bras\u00edlia. Compared to China, less supply side actors (ie: IVF clinics, animal model groups) were interviewed as they seemed to play a more background role to the main themes presented in initial interviews with primary actors. One 77 media consultant was interviewed as well, as the role of media and presenting information to the public was a key factor in the eventual support of stem cell research in Brazil. Table 3.2: Number of experts interviewed in each organization type in Brazil.

The team interviewed 53 experts from wide spectrum of stake-holders (see Table 3.3)7. Interviews were conducted in Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Vellore and Chennai. 7 I describe these fieldwork metrics here even though I did not conduct this fieldwork, so as to present the reader a better sense of the fieldwork done in India that generated the interviews used for the comparison. 78 Table 3.3: Number of RM experts interviewed by organization type in India Type of Organization Number Research Institutes 15 Hospitals and Clinics 12 Policy makers/regulators 10 Firms 8 Others 5 Interest groups 3 Total 53 3.4 Primary Data Analysis and Interpretation The analysis of qualitative data is often not a discrete methodological step and instead begins parallel to data collection - a process sometimes called sequential analysis or interim analysis (Pope, Ziebland et al. 2000). This process allows the researcher to go back and refine research questions, pursue developing lines of inquiry from the interviews, and collect additional data where needed. For description purposes, I have divided the analytical process into roughly four stages: 1) initial analysis, 2) familiarization, 3) formal coding, 4) final analysis. 3.4.1 Initial analysis Initial data analysis begins within the scoping exercise and interviews themselves. Emerging data reinforced or contradicted my a priori ideas, and I began to probe emerging themes as they developed from the interviews. Interview guides were modified to reflect new topics from the interviews. Memos and discussions within the research team at all stages of the research project 79 helped me to conceptually organize information, and to identify trends, themes and important narratives within the interview dialogue. 3.4.2 Familiarization The analytical process is continued in the familiarization step, where the researcher becomes immersed in the data by listening to the interviews, transcribing and verifying the interviews, and by reading the transcripts, field notes and memos (Pope, Ziebland et al. 2000; Ritchie and Spencer 2002). This analytical step is recoded largely through memos and initial code lists, as I wrote out emerging themes or relationships discovered within the data. Usually in policy research, the volume of the data is so large that not all of it can be formally reviewed in the familiarization step, and selection of what material to review must be made (Ritchie and Spencer 2002). While some interviews containing richer content or broader themes were read more often, I reviewed all the interview transcripts fully at either the transcription and verification stage, to ensure my proximity to the data as a whole. 3.4.3 Formal coding Analysis of interview transcripts requires a formalized, systematic and structured way of sifting through reams of text to pull out the important themes and to establish the relationships between them. Thematic analysis is one of the fundamental techniques used in qualitative research across disciplines and theoretical perspectives for \"identifying, analysing and reporting patterns (themes) within the data\" (Braun and Clarke 2006). Here, the interview transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis, similar to that described by Bruan and Clarke and by Ryan and Bernard (Ryan and Bernard 2000; Ryan and Bernard 2003; Braun and Clarke 2006). Qualitative data software can greatly increase the ease of manipulation of large amounts of data by facilitating 80 both the organization and retrieval of information (Weitzman 2002). For this project, ATLAS.ti v5.2 was used as a data management tool. Thematic analysis is typically a multistep data reduction technique used to fragment large quantities of raw textual information into manageable pieces for analysis (Ryan and Bernard 2003). Ryan and Bernard identify four tasks needed to analyse text: 1) discovering themes and subthemes 2) winnowing themes to an important and manageable few 3) building theme hierarchies, and 4) linking themes into theoretical models. Initial rounds of coding are done to identify themes and subthemes within the text. In this type of research, themes can arise from a) a priori issues imbedded in the interview topic guide, b) unexpected issues raised by the respondents, and c) analytical themes based on patterns of views or experiences expressed by the respondents (Ritchie and Spencer 2002). Subsequent rounds of coding identify the most salient themes by reducing and organizing themes into conceptual categories. The modeling stage of analysis helps integrate and refine specific themes and sub-themes, and establish the interaction of these themes. To this end, I hand drew several large theme networks or webs to help organize and visualize the hierarchies and relationships between themes, similar to the thematic network analysis described by Attride-Sterling (2001). 3.4.4 Final analysis Just as analysis begins before formal coding, it also continues well into the writing of the final results. This final stage of analysis can help pull detailed information from the data to fully flesh out important themes. The results from my other data sources were triangulated with the interview data to ensure the integrity of the research findings. At this stage, I was at times lead back to the data again in search of specific information that further corroborates or contradict these findings. The final stages of analysis include some qualitative interpretation - where the 81 researcher moves past the breakdown of the data to create knowledge that is faithful to the data (Sandelowski 2007). All four stages of analysis were repeated or refined as new interviews, correspondence, or other data was updated or added to reflect any changes occurring on the ground. 3.5 Collection and analysis of secondary data 3.5.1 Documents and field notes Key documents used in this project include major domestic policies, regulations, laws, and RM-related publications in the studied countries. For example, in China, these documents include among others: State Food and Drug Administration guidelines for approving biodrugs in China; Ministry of Health (China) \"Ethical Guidelines on Human Embryonic Stem Cell\"; policy briefs and documents regarding funding strategies including 863 State High-Tech Development Plan and 973 National Basic Research Program, reports on science and technology in China, and peer reviewed publications on stem cell research in China published by leading Chinese researchers, bioethicists and policy analysts. Published statistical information on health status in the countries of interest, as well as government investment in biomedical or biotechnology sectors were examined where available, to substantiate information or views presented in the interviews. Information sources used include data published in primary literature, reports of international agencies such as World Bank, World Health Organization, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and government published statistics, among others. 82 Key documents either informed the analysis directly, or were coded and analysed following the thematic analysis techniques described above, depending on the type of content present in the documents. 3.5.2 Scientometrics Scientometric analysis is a commonly used method of empirically measuring publication output of productivity, distribution, and acquisition of knowledge in national innovation systems, particularly in science and technology sectors (Leydesdorff and Gauthier 1996; Molatudi and Pouris 2006; Kim 2007) Scientometric analysis has been used in a number of recent publications measuring productivity over time of biotechnology in emerging economies including India, South Africa, and other Asian countries including China (Patra and Bhattacharya al. 2006; Kim 2007). Although the parameters and units of analysis of these methods may differ, they all rely on the information available from publications - such as authors, publication date, and institutional addresses to evaluate scientific activity. They are an important alternative data source that can increase our confidence in conclusions raised in the interviews (Leydesdorff and Gauthier 1996; Murray 2002). Scientometric data was used in two ways in this research: first in the scoping exercise and then secondly, in my analysis of publication rates. The first was informal: I looked at the most prolific publishers in stem cells, tissue engineering and gene therapy in Brazil and China to help form a preliminary idea of which research groups were central to the development of RM in each country. The second was more formal: this scientiometric data was used to generate quantitative information regarding the rates of publication in each country. I generated the data from the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science citation database using keyword searches. The topic search terms \" 'stem cells' OR 'stem cell' \" were used for the indicated 83 year(s) (between 2001 and 2009) and results were segmented by author's country as listed by the index. Note that only one author must list an address corresponding to the country in question to be included in the output. Also note that results for China include Mainland China and Hong Kong, and results for the United Kingdom are composed of publications for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland8. 3.5.3 Patent trend analysis Patenting trends are used as an indicator of technology development, similarly to scientometrics. Patenting trends have been used in China by Guan and He to describe science and technology in the Chinese innovation system, and by Murray to explore science and technology in tissue engineering (Murray 2002; Guan and He 2007). Quach et al. examined patenting trends in six developing countries, including the three countries focused on in this study (Quach, Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir et al. 2006). I did an initial patent search for China, India and Brazil. I examined both the patent office of Brazil and the United States Patent and trademark Office (USPTO) database. I focused on the Brazil patent database because patent issues were a major theme in the interview data. Brazil's patent office, the Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial (INPI), supports an online public access patent database, which was searched using the key words \"cellulas-tronco\" and \"cellulas-trocos\", meaning \"stem cell\" and \"stem cells\" respectively. The details of each resulting record were recorded, including the country from which the patent was filed, and the other countries the patent was filed in, among others. Patents for particular subsets of technology such as RM can be 8 I selected all four UK constituent countries at the same step. This eliminates the duplicates created by adding up the number of papers from each country, as some papers may contain address from more than one part of the UK. 84 hard to generate consistently, and with so few patents in RM, there were few trends worth reporting. Mostly, the results of the patent analysis were used to triangulate information from the interviews. 3.6 Case study comparison The comparative analysis included the data sets of three case studies: Brazil, China, and India. The findings of this comparative analysis resulted from a comparison of the major themes across these data sets. After identifying major themes of interest from the last rounds of analysis, the raw data was again consulted to ensure that themes and codes that reflected the new inter-country comparative contexts were pulled out, to further flesh out these themes, and to ensure that there was no conflicting data to these new emerging inter-country thematic relationships. These themes were compared to identify similarities and differences, and to determine how the overarching themes impact our understanding of RM development in the emerging economies. While the collection and analysis of the Brazil and China cases have been already discussed in detail, I discuss below how the India data was incorporated into the analysis. 3.6.1 Secondary analysis of Indian interview data The Indian case study was conducted by another member of the wider research team, and supervised by the same research supervisor. Only the interview data was used from this analysis; I additionally collected and analysed all additional key documents, policies, scientometric data, and patent information in order to complete the case study database. The interview data was collected using the same methodology described here to explore the same research questions, making the previously collected interview data extremely well suited for 85 comparison with the Brazil and China data. The Indian interviews were reanalysed for several reasons: 1) this allows me to become immersed in the Indian data, allowing me to better evaluate it comparatively, 2) themes important to the comparison may not have been central to the Indian case study alone, 3) it allows consistent coding so that themes of interest can be easily accessed or further refined, and 4) re-analysing the data ensures any contrary or negative case data relevant to the comparative analysis is not missed. Some of the limitations of using secondary data are discussed in the limitations section below. 3.7 Case study quality 3.7.1 Validity The quality of qualitative research can be described in terms of the rigor of the research and the confidence in the validity of the conclusions. One of the main ways to increase the rigor of data is by demonstrating the convergence of evidence, a process called triangulation (Yin 2008). Triangulation allows the researcher to reach conclusions based on multiple perspectives. Patton (2002) identifies four main types of triangulation: 1) data triangulation, 2) investigator triangulation, 3) theory triangulation, and 4) methodological triangulation. Below I discuss how triangulation builds confidence in the validity of this research. Data triangulation involves comparing data sources to ensure that the information that is recorded is accurate, increasing the descriptive validity of the data (Maxwell 2002; Yin 2008). Interviewees were experts with good knowledge of the research topic; most information they gave was accurate and easily corroborated. However, descriptive validity includes not only the truthfulness of the data, but also whether the inclusions and omissions within the data allow for a representative understanding of the studied phenomena. Participants may shape their answers to 86 fit what they feel the researcher is interested in hearing, or to reinforce a particular message or impression they wish to give the researcher. Collecting a balanced data set can be particularity challenging for intercultural interviews as cultural values may influence what the interviewee is willing to say or how it is interpreted. For these reasons, triangulation within the data is essential. In this research, data triangulation occurred on multiple levels. Data sets were compared between interviews, between interview sets (eg: researchers vs governmental agencies, stem cell vs tissue engineering), and between data sources (eg: interview, documents, scientometrics, etc). Methodological triangulation involves comparing conclusions arrived at using several types of methods, and is a hallmark of case study research (Patton 2002; Yin 2008). Here, results from the scientometric analysis, patent analysis, document analysis, policy analysis, observations and field notes are all used to substantiate my conclusions. Investigator triangulation helps to ensure that errors are not made during the data analysis and increases the interpretive validity of the research (Maxwell 2002). In this study, the research supervisor Dr. Halla Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir was present for all the Chinese interviews, for a few of the Brazil interviews, and for most of the Indian interviews. Discussions on the data analysis between Dr. Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir and I helped to ensure that we both agreed on the main themes present in the data, and to minimize any bias I may bring to the analysis, and to ensure I remain open to unanticipated results. Investigator triangulation can also help increase the theoretical validity of the data, or the confidence placed in the results when the research moves beyond description to explanation of studied phenomena (Maxwell 2002). Both theoretical and interpretive validity are also increased by the presentation of secondary data sources, or by using direct quotes to illustrate the connection between the researcher's findings and the data. Clear explanation building when 87 presenting results, constructing chains of evidence, and having key informants review drafts of the case study report are all techniques discussed by Yin (2008), and are techniques used in this study to increase the validity of the research findings. The research design and initial results were also presented to my thesis committee, within the research centre, and at conferences. This helped generate feedback, ensuring that results were presented with adequate clarity and with sufficient evidence to be convincing, further improving the interpretive and theoretical validity of the research. 3.7.2 Limitations of this study All of the results are reflective of the time the research was conducted, in context of their cultural, political, and social environment. Because RM development is still in its infancy, the interviews represented predominantly the views of researchers and those who interact with researchers. If the study is repeated later, the greater abundance of more market-orientated stake-holders may significantly change some of the main themes. While extensive effort was taken to triangulate results between participants and between different data sources, the results of my interviews reflect the opinions of the participants and may not necessarily reflect the views of any one interviewee, nor will they necessarily represent the views of those beyond the sample pool. Due to the amount of activity in the stem cell field, there is a higher representation of stem cell related data, potentially outweighing unique aspects of gene therapy and tissue engineering innovation in the discussion. While I have a high degree in confidence in my results, they may at some times be balanced to reflect the interests of the participants, in so representing part of a reality and should not be seen as an exhaustive or definitive discussion of RM in Brazil. For example, my Brazilian participants 88 were more willing to discuss challenges to research than my Chinese participants. The discussion of challenges in Brazil may therefore be more comprehensive, but this cannot be extrapolated to mean that research is more challenging in Brazil. Another limitation stems from the secondary analysis of the Indian data. Much of the work done prior to the interviews to identify the stake-holders, as well as many of the observations based on viewing the RM facilities, and non-verbal cues during the interview, help to interpret the transcripts. Therefore, it would have been preferable to have conducted the scoping exercise myself and to have been present for all the interviews. In addition, researchers may at times not ask certain follow up questions based on their understanding of the phenomena, information is not easily transferable to another researcher. Researchers also pursue different lines of questioning, based on what strikes them as most interesting or imperative at the time. The presence of Dr. Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir for at least some of all the interviews may help integrate the research across the three countries as she is able to comment on the quality of the comparative results, to ensure no misrepresentation of the data occurred, and to ensure no essential data relevant to the explored themes was omitted. While not optimal, secondary analysis allows for the use of a large and rich data set that was collected by nearly identical means. Secondary analysis here allows the comparison and discussion of RM in the three countries, allowing for a much richer analysis than would otherwise be possible, and I do not think that the secondary analysis introduces enough of a limitation as to be worrisome. The sequential collection of data is also a limitation of this study. Case studies were conducted one after the other, which means that interesting themes that come up in one case study can not be explored in previous cases, where data collection is complete. Fieldwork is also done in one or two discrete sessions; additional field trips for data collection cannot occur even if new lines 89 of questioning come up during the analysis. This is a normal limitation for international studies, where simultaneous analysis and data collection are not financially or logistically practical. To mitigate this, some initial theme development is done in the field, and additional observations and consultations were used to supplement the interviews when possible. In order to keep the data current between initial collection and final publication, every effort has been made to keep astride of current of emerging developments in RM in each of the studied countries, and to update my results with additional interviews, correspondence, and documents. 3.8 Ethics The Ethics Review Office of University of Toronto Research Services reviewed and approved the research protocol for this project. The University of Toronto agreed that the project is low risk, with minimal likelihood of any beneficial or adverse impacts for participants. I tried to maintain equitable gender representation in the interviews, and no compensation was offered to the interviewees for their participation in the research project. The Indian case study data has remained within the research team defined in the protocol, as required by the approved ethics protocol. Informed consent was obtained from all participants (see Appendix C for a copy of the participant consent form) by fully informing them about the research project, their role in the project, and their ability to withdraw from the study at any time or to refrain from answering any question. Participants were provided with a project description and consent form in either English or the participant's national language, as preferred by the participant (see Appendix D and E for consent forms in Portuguese and Mandarin and Appendix F and G for examples of the project description). Consent forms were translated by professional translation services and 90 verified by an additional bilingual team member until both independently agreed on the translation. No participants withdrew from the study. Most questions interviewees skipped seemed related to unpublished or proprietary information, or the participant felt they had lacked the expertise for a particular question. In a limited number of cases, interviewees agreed to participate but were not comfortable with written consent. Those that declined to sign the consent form often said that they were concerned that their ideas and experiences did not necessarily reflect those of their employers, and while we encouraged participants to explicitly write on the consent form that they were signing on behalf of themselves only, several participants were still uncomfortable signing. In these cases, verbal consent was obtained instead, after reading the consent forms and project information. These participants were eager to participate in the interview, answered questions openly, and consented to digital audio recording of the interviews, all indicating their willingness to participate. This hesitation to participate in written consent may be due to cultural differences in how written consent is perceived, and similar issues obtaining written consent have been reported both in China (Liang and Lu 2006) and in other countries (for example, Shaibu 2007). Other authors, too, have found verbal consent acceptable in cases where participants are uncomfortable with written consent (Gordon 2000; Liang and Lu 2006; Shaibu 2007; Sumathipala, Siribaddana et al. 2008). Interviewees were asked if they consented to digital audio recording of the interview. Where interviewees declined audio recording, hand-written notes taken during these interviews were typed-up and used in the analysis in lieu of verbatim transcripts. When asking participants to recommend other potential interviewees, I also verified whether the participant wanted to be identified as the source of the recommendation. A draft of the case study publications was sent to 91 participants prior to its submission for publication to ensure accuracy of the results and to verify participant's continued consent for any quotes or identifying information not publically available. A member check was also performed in the same manner on a draft of the India RM research publication. Published results of the findings were disseminated freely to all participants of the research. 3.9 Dissemination of results Research results can only impact current knowledge, norms and practices if the results are adequately disseminated. It is therefore important to considered strategies early on to disseminate research results \"in an understandable form, and to appropriate audiences\" (Berg 2004). I targeted my results to those interested in staying abreast of RM developments including RM researchers, RM innovation actors, and those policy makers charged with stimulating RM innovation. These audiences were targeted within the studied countries, within Canada, and globally. I also wanted to make our results available to the general science audience, particularly since this research was conducted using public funding. Our dissemination strategy is outlined below and includes typical academic strategies such as conferences and publications, and broader strategies such as press releases and collaborative strategies. 3.9.1 Conferences The preliminary and final results of this research were presented at several Canadian and international conferences, as listed in Appendix H. These conferences represented the interests of several types of audiences: innovation system researchers, international policy makers, and scientific researchers from both developed and developing countries. 92 3.9.2 Publications and media releases I first published my overall findings in high impact peer-reviewed science journals with a wide readership in order to better reach those interested in scientific and biomedical innovation. A copy of the paper was sent to all research participants. I then published additional articles and commentaries highlighting and expanding on subsets of our results in more discipline specific journals of social science, bioethics, policy and innovation. When possible, I obtained open access for the publications. For example, open access was purchased for \"Cultivating Regenerative Medicine Innovation in China\", and for \"Regenerative medicine in Brazil: small but innovative\", published by the journal Regenerative Medicine. A series of distribution tactics was taken to ensure these publications reached my target audiences. Links to the publications were placed on the MRC website, sent to relevant newsletters, and posted on social media networking sites including MRC's Facebook and Twitter accounts. For select paper(s)9 felt to have the highest potential impact or general interest, a press release is prepared and distributed by a media consultant, and was distributed via the McLaughlin-Rotman Centre for Global Health's email network of approximately 7000 members from across the globe (See Appendix I for a copy of the media release). For the China case study, the media release was translated and distributed in Chinese. Based on the number of media interviews requested, the number of downloads of the media releases, and the international press coverage, the dissemination of these papers was highly effective. (See Appendix J for dissemination impact metrics) 9 A press release was prepared for the China case study publication in Regenerative Medicine, another may be prepared when the comparative analysis I performed is published. 93 In addition to these publications, the full research findings are explained in detail in this graduate thesis in fulfillment of the requirements for a doctorate degree in Medical Sciences from the University of Toronto. Additional publications are available in Appendix K - L 3.9.3 Collaborative efforts In addition to traditional methods of dissemination, efforts were made to incorporate the knowledge gained through this research into interactive learning opportunities. For example, in order to ensure emerging economy participation in regulatory discussions, our research team collaborated with the Rick Hansen Institute, which was organizing an international workshop on the clinical translation of stem cell therapies, to ensure the invitation and participation of representatives from emerging economies. I also discussed my experiences and research results with interested industry representatives, media representatives, researchers, university classes, and interested members of the public. 3.10 References Attride-Stirling, J.

Here, I analyse how capacity in RM was built in China to identify some of its main strengths and challenges. This case study of RM in China is primarily based on interviews with experts in China, including researchers, policy makers, clinicians, representatives of firms and regulators. The analysis shows that diverse groups are active in this field in China. Leading research groups are contributing extensively to international peer-reviewed journals. Strong governmental support and recruitment of highly trained Chinese scientists from abroad has made it possible for China to rapidly build up capacity in RM. However, some hospitals in 1 This Chapter is published as: McMahon D.S., Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir H., Singer P.A., Daar A.S. (2010) regenerative medicine innovation in China. 5(1), 35-44.

China has been able to catapult itself into the forefront of RM but needs to address current regulatory challenges in order to secure its position in this emerging field. 4.1 Introduction Mainland China is becoming an important player in RM, including stem cell research, tissue engineering and gene therapy. China has been investing heavily in application-orientated research and clinical trials in this field, and has several companies and hospitals offering therapeutic services. According to my analysis of publication data, China published 1337 articles on stem cells in international peer-reviewed journals in 2009, compared with only 37 articles in the year 2000, and has surpassed Canada's and Australia's publication levels (see Figure 4.1). This places China as the world's fifth largest publisher on stem cells, after the USA, Germany, Japan and the UK, which published 6635, 1858, 1491, and 1401 articles, respectively, in 2009. From 2000 to 2009, China published most frequently in the journals Blood and Cell Research. China has also approved the world's first two gene therapies, although their efficacy has received criticism. The Chinese government has been instrumental in building up a skilled workforce and backing this field with strategic funding programs. According to the Ministry of Science and Technology, China generates 400,000 graduates in science and medicine each year, in addition to the high caliber scientists it recruits from abroad (Zweig 2006; Ministry of Science and Technology 2007a). Gross domestic expenditure on R&D in science and technology has grown from US$5917 million in 1996 to $43,986 million in 2007 (Ministry of Science and Technology 100 2007a), and stem cell research, tissue engineering and gene therapy are key areas receiving priority funding. Figure 4.1: Stem cell publications per year by country for 2000-2008. Data were generated using 'stem cell' or 'stem cells' as a search topic for the years 2000-2008 and refining results by country using the ISI Web of Science citation index expanded database. Additional details are available in methods. Note that listed countries have permissive stem cell research policies except France and Canada, which have more restrictive policies, and that China, India and Brazil are considered to be emerging economies. (Data accurate as of 21 February 2011). In order to better understand China's role in the field of RM, I designed and conducted a case study of the RM scene in China. Here, I analyse how China has been able to build capacity in 101 this field and identify its main strengths and challenges. To my knowledge, this is the first such analysis relying on original empirical data collection with Chinese experts. This research will be of interest to the international biomedical research community as it provides a thorough account of the RM scene in China. It will further be of value to policy makers both from within and outside China who are interested in RM developments, as well as all those interested in China's progress in biotechnology and/or health research. 4.2 Methods Please see Chapter 3 for the methodology. 4.3 Results & discussion 4.3.1 State of RM research in China The key research groups currently involved in RM are mostly centralized in China's main urban centres. The highest densities of researchers are located in Beijing and Shanghai, with others spread over Guangzhou, Tianjin, Changsha, Chonqing and Shenzhen, among others (see Figure 4.2). The groups described within this chapter are just a sample of the ongoing RM research in China; this is not meant to be a complete account of all RM activity in the country. Research on RM is mostly done in universities, hospitals and research institutes, and researchers often have multiple affiliations with different organizations. Most of the researchers I interviewed publish frequently in international peer-reviewed journals and felt they were well funded by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) funding programs. 102 Figure 4.2: Map of main regenerative medicine activities in China China's RM sector is built on a history of research in animal embryology and cloning (see Box 4.1). Although research stagnated for over a decade during and immediately following the Chinese Cultural Revolution in the 1970s, it has in the last decade been gaining momentum. Researchers from Xinhua hospital (Shanghai) were the first in the world to successfully reprogram somatic cells to an embryonic state using non-human gametes, which they did by transferring human skin cell nuclei to rabbit oocytes (Chen, He et al. 2003). China has also created at least 25 hESC lines to date, including four human embryonic parthenogenetic stem cell lines, a type of stem cell line that to my knowledge only two other groups worldwide had created. These numbers are based on my analysis of articles published in international peer-reviewed journals. The creation of some stem cell lines may not be published or may only be published in Chinese journals, and some estimate that China has over 70 cell lines (Abbott, 103 Dennis et al. 2006). In comparison, Guhr et al. estimated that China, the USA and the UK had developed 21, 38 and four hESC lines, respectively, in 2006 (Guhr, Kurtz et al. 2006). Box 4.1. In the beginning: a long history in stem cell research. China can trace its roots in stem cell research back to 1963 when Dizhou Tong cloned an Asian carp, producing the world's first cloned fish and only the second animal to be cloned by nuclear transfer (Tong, Wu et al. 1963). 10 years later, Tong created the first interspecies clone by transplanting DNA from an Asian carp into the egg of a European carp (Tong, Ye et al. 1973). Since then, Chinese scientists have used this technique to successfully clone other mammalian species including goats, pigs, cattle and mice. Considered difficult to clone due to oocyte physiology, the first cloned rat was produced from collaboration between the Institute of Zoology in Beijing, a French team from l'Institute National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA) and the French company GenOway (Zhou, Renard et al. 2003). China's gene therapy research and development have also led to noteworthy gene therapy products. Sibiono in Shenzhen developed Gendicine, the world's first commercially produced gene therapy, in 2004. Gendicine uses the tumor suppressor gene p53 to reduce tumor size in head and neck cancers. Shanghai Sunway Biotech Co. produced the second commercially licensed gene therapy in China, Oncorine, in 2006. Some of the interviewees indicated, however, that they felt that these gene therapies were commercialized too quickly without sufficiently clear evidence of their medicinal benefits over current therapeutic options. 4.3.1.1 Research & development groups Interviewees in China identified several institutions that appear to be heavily engaged in basic research in RM. The Institute of Zoology in Beijing is known for their work on animal cloning 104 by SCNT, as well as for studies on reprogramming and early embryonic development in cloned animals. In Shanghai, the Center of Excellence in Tissue Engineering does basic research on mesenchymal stem cells and, according to my analysis, is well known as the leading tissue-engineering centre in China. Researchers at the Peking University Stem Cell Centre (Beijing) focus on the gene regulation and differentiation of stem cells, particularly on neural stem cell proliferation. There is also a network of four human stem cell banks being developed in China, with the aim to be a repository of high-quality human stem cell lines for distribution to researchers in China and abroad. These centres will emphasize the development of embryonic stem cell lines, and are located in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and within the Chinese Academy of Science. Other types of institutions are also important to this field: fertility clinics serve as a source of discarded embryonic stem cells for some research in China, and cord blood banks may serve as a source of stem cells for clinical applications. My analysis shows that China has also actively pursued applications of research. Huashan Hospital in Shanghai cultivated human brain tissue in 2002 after taking a sample from the end of a chopstick implanted in a patient's frontal lobe following a disagreement at a restaurant. Neural stem cells were cultured from trauma patients and were reinjected into their brains in the first known controlled clinical trial of adult stem cell therapy for traumatic brain injury (dti Global 2004). ChinaSCINet also conducts clinical trials on stem cell therapy. Established in 2004, this group is composed of 27 hospitals and spinal cord injury centres across mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. According to the group's website, they are ready to commence Phase II clinical trials to test the efficacy and safety of using HLA-matched cord blood stem cells and oral lithium to treat spinal cord injury in about 40 patients (ChinaSCINet 2011). Researchers in China have begun stem cell clinical trials for several indications, including myocardial infarction, limb ischemia, graft-versus-host disease, liver disease and neural diseases (Liao and Zhao 2008). The 105 Shanghai Tissue Engineering Centre has created several tissue types including blood vessel, tendon, bone, cartilage, skin, cornea and muscle fiber. Its director, who created the famed mouse with cartilage in the shape of a human ear on its back is now in charge of human trials on cranial bone reconstruction using bone-marrow stromal cells. My analysis reveals that many research programs in China are orientated towards treatment of particular diseases. The Xuan Wu Hospital Cell Therapy Center in Beijing is studying the use of foetal neural stem cells and embryonic stem cells for treatment of type 1 diabetes and has done preclinical trials on monkeys using adult progenitor cells for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (Cheng, Xiao et al. 2008). The researchers at Beijing Institute of Transfusion Medicine (Beijing) are studying adult stem cells for the treatment of heart disease, liver disease and blood disease. Researchers at Peking University are studying adult stem cells for the treatment of diabetes, as well as developing novel mouse models with humanized blood and liver systems for vaccine testing with funding from the Grand Challenges in Global Health initiative of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The Chinese Academy of Science and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (Shanghai) are working on translational medicine focusing on the microdegeneration of aging and on the treatment of cataract eye disease using stem cells. 4.3.1.2 Firms The interviews indicate that several firms are active in the RM field in China. SinoCells Biotech (Beijing) is, for example, a spin-off from the Stem Cell Research Center at Peking University. It plans to commercialize therapies for degenerative disease, and is developing a treatment for corneal disease using autologous mesenchymal stem cells. Union Stem Cell and Gene Engineering Company Ltd (StemGene) in Tianjin has developed a cord blood bank and stem cell bank, and is also working on bringing stem cell therapies to market. Shanghai Qisheng is 106 producing wound-healing products and scaffolding material to enhance recovery post-surgery. The National Tissue Engineering Centre (Shanghai) is also a public/private company focused on developing the applications of research in tissue engineering. As mentioned above, Sibiono (Shenzhen) and Shanghai Sunway Biotech Co. both produce gene therapy drugs that are on the market in China. An additional company located in Beijing, Vector Gene Technology Company Ltd, has a gene therapy treatment for lower limb ischemia caused by diabetes in Phase I clinical trials. Vector Gene Technology Company Ltd is awaiting approval from the SFDA to initiate two additional clinical trials for gene therapy treatment of hemophilia B and lung cancer. When comparing the RM scene in China and India it seems that the development of the field is characterized by a stronger private sector presence in the former, as very few RM firms can be found in India (Lander, Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir et al. 2008). 4.3.1.3 Stem cell treatment centres Several companies and hospitals have moved into RM services and already provide stem cell treatments in more than 200 hospitals across China. They have developed extensive distribution networks for the treatment of diseases such as ataxia, Lou Gehrig's disease, traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, autism, cerebral palsy, stroke, optic nerve hypoplasia and many others. They not only treat Chinese patients, but are also targeting large numbers of foreign patients engaging in an increasingly popular but controversial stem cell tourism industry. There is neither clinical trial evidence nor peer-reviewed research publications supporting these therapies. Shenzhen Beike Biotechnology is the largest of these therapy centres and specializes in distributing stem cell therapy to 26 hospitals in China and Thailand. They claim to have treated over 5000 patients to date, including more than 900 foreign patients. According to their website, 107 Beike Biotechnology principally offers purifications of cord blood stem cells or bone-marrow stem cells provided surgically, by intravenous injection, or by injections into spinal fluid. Beike Biotechnology has recently joined with Tsingua University (Beijing) to develop a State Key Laboratory on stem cell engineering and reprogramming, for which they have received a US$4 million grant from the Shenzhen government (Beike Biotechnology 2011). The Stem Cell Center affiliated with Tiantan Puhua Neuroscience Hospital in Beijing offers two types of treatments. The first claims to activate and proliferate the body's own neural stem cells through oral and intravenous medications and rehabilitation. The second type of treatment involves a lumbar puncture or brain injection of autologous bone-marrow stem cells, foetal neural stem cells or 'human retinal pigment epithelium stem cells' to improve symptoms of stroke, cerebral palsy, spinal injury, Parkinson's disease or other neurological diseases (Beijing Puhua International Hospital 2011). This group also provides stem cell treatments to patients that travel to Beijing from across North America, Europe and Asia. Stem cell therapies provided at Beijing Xishan Institute for Neuroregeneration and Functional Recovery have generated considerable debate in both the general media and scientific journals. Doctors here claim to inject human olfactory ensheathing glial cells from aborted fetuses for the treatment of spinal cord injury and a variety of CNS diseases (Neuro-Regeneration Repair and Functional Recovery 2011). According to a representative from the group, so far approximately 1500 patients have received this treatment, approximately 1000 of whom are foreign patients. To my knowledge, this is the only Chinese stem cell therapy examined scientifically that has been published in high-impact journals. One case study documented early motor and sensory improvement of a patient with severe spinal cord injury (Guest, Herrera et al. 2006), whereas another paper published in 2006 found no improvement in seven patients with chronic spinal 108 cord injuries (Dobkin, Curt et al. 2006). A recent publication reviewed the efficacy of olfactory ensheathing cell therapies for spinal cord injuries internationally and found functional improvement in some spinal cord injury animal models, but stated that efficacy in humans had not yet been established (Radtke, Sasaki et al. 2008). 4.3.2 Building RM on China's strengths 4.3.2.1 Regulations According to my interviews, researchers believe that China's permissive stem cell research regulations have helped to propel their biomedicine sector forward (see Box 4.2). These regulations allow therapeutic cloning, the use of surplus embryos or discarded foetal cells from abortions as well as embryos created from somatic cell nuclear transfer or parthenogenetic split blastocytes, activities allowed in several countries. What sets China apart from most of the rest of the world is that these regulations do not prohibit the fusion of human genetic material with non-human oocytes. Similarly to other countries worldwide, the regulations prohibit reproductive cloning, the use of human embryos past 14 days post-fertilization, the fusion of human and non-human gametes, or the implantation of research embryos into human or animal uterus. The stem cell regulations require researchers to provide informed consent to all subjects and require each institute to have an ethics review board that must approve all hESC research. Many stem cell experts consider that, although permissive, these regulations are similar to those in the UK and feel that the international community misinterprets the Chinese research regulations as weak. 109 Box 4.2. Development of China's stem cell regulations. The first official stem cell policy was released on November of 2002 when the Ministry of Health set the boundaries for stem cell research in a single sentence directive, or the 'Four No's': \"Under no situation, under no circumstances, will human reproductive cloning experiments be 1) endorsed, 2) permitted, 3) supported, or 4) accepted\" (Liao, Li et al. 2007). These regulations rearticulated the Ministry of Public Health's FivePoint Declaration on Cloning, which bans all trials involving human cloning with no exception for therapeutic cloning (D\u00f6ring 2003). Two separate groups in China felt more specific regulations were needed to oversee an increasingly active stem cell field, and developed draft regulations for proposal to the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Science and Technology in 2001. A team of ethicists and researchers in Beijing submitted 'Ethical Principles and Management Proposals on Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research'. Simultaneously, a draft proposal entitled 'Ethical Guidelines for Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research' was prepared at the Bioethics Committee of the Southern China National Human Genome Center in Shanghai (Chinese National Human Genome Center at Shanghai Ethics Committee 2004). The Ministry's Four No's were replaced on 24 December, 2003 when the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Science and Technology jointly promulgated the 'Ethical Guiding Principles on Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research', reflecting the main ideas proposed in the drafts above (Ministry of Science and Technology and Ministry of Health 2003). There was a consensus amongst the interviewees that these permissive regulations are supported by Chinese culture and values, and that many of the oppositions to stem cell research prevalent in the Western world are absent in China. They stressed that the Chinese population does not typically perceive an embryo as having person-hood, so the creation and use of embryos is not bound by the same ethical issues hotly debated in some other parts of the world. An interviewee 110 told us, for example, \"When we draft our guidelines, we always need to think about our culture as well. For Chinese people, we have not so strong religious ideas about the [embryo]... This is not a person, we don't think so...so we accept,\" [Interview CH21] Moreover, the general public appears to have high levels of acceptance of new technologies that are perceived to increase quality of life, particularly when no other recourse of treatment exists. 4.3.2.2 Governmental support According to my analysis, the government's support of RM is instrumental to its success. Several State Key Laboratories - laboratories sanctioned by the Chinese government to examine topics of particular national interest - are concentrating on RM research. The 863 and 973 programs are the main national research funding programs for science and technology in China. The 863 program was initiated in 1986, and focuses primarily on the applications of research. Also known as the High Technology R&D program, a key objective of 863 is to develop bioengineering technologies 'for improving the quality of life' and it places emphasis on commercialization and international cooperation. Projects seeking funding are evaluated using criteria on innovation, feasibility and commercial potential of the proposal (People's Republic of China 2004a). The 973 program, also called the National Basic Research Program, was approved in June 1997 and promotes basic research initiatives. The main 973 priority projects focused on RM are Stem Cell Research: Basic Research and Clinical Applications, Applied Basic Research on Gene Therapy and Scientific Research on Fundamental Issues of Tissue Engineering. At least four other priority projects include research on RM: The Applicative Basic Research of Nerve Injury Restore and Functional Reconstruction, Basic Research for Treatment of Severe Trauma and Repair of Injured Tissues, Basic Research on Tissue Inducing Biomaterials, and Study on 111 Mechanisms of Nonhuman Primate Somatic Nuclear Transfer and Therapeutic Cloning(People's Republic of China 2004b). These national priorities are determined by the National Five Year Plans, as set out by the State Government. Other funding strategies that support RM research include the National Natural Science Foundation of China that funds basic science, and city Science and Technology Bureaus. A report by the UK Stem Cell Initiative estimated that MOST will spend between US$73.2 million and US$292.9 million on stem cell research between 2006 and 2010(UK Stem Cell Initiative 2005). The Chinese Academy of Science funds an additional US$20 million of stem cell research per year(International Stem Cell Forum 2010). These figures are much lower than the amount spent on similar research in the West; however, low wages, physical infrastructure overheads and material costs increase the purchasing power of Chinese currency. 4.3.2.3 Labour force Another key strength of China's stem cell research program identified by my analysis is its highly educated labour force. China's stem cell field is comprised of experts, almost all of whom have spent some time training overseas. Called 'sea turtles' for this word's similarity in Chinese to the word for 'overseas returnees', the government has come up with a variety of financial and research incentives to attract sea turtles back to China (Zweig 2006). Recruiting diaspora is part of the 11th Five Year Plan for 2006-2010 and the Ministry of Personnel has indicated that engaging 'internationally published' returnees in the science sector is of primary importance (Wang 2007). The MOST also states its aim to 'set a stage for the outstanding overseas Chinese people to return home to serve the mother land' directly in the 973 funding program. Several of the interviewees stated that almost 100% of researchers active in RM in China had trained abroad and many have had significant working experience in leading stem cell research groups 112 internationally. Low labour costs in China allow these researchers to assemble large labs that provide training for numerous students. This plan is helping to create a favorable educational environment of highly skilled supervisors, which may encourage more students to remain in China following their training. According to a stem cell researcher: \"There is a younger generation of scientists being almost completely trained here; to become good professors, to become principal investigators. But overall the number is still low,\" [Interview CH6]. 4.3.2.4 Focus on therapy My interviewees believe that China's success in RM is due in no small part to their strategic focus on research for the treatment of disease and development of therapy. Approximately 78% of China's funding in research and development is reserved for product development, with an additional 16.8% for applied research (Ministry of Science and Technology 2007b). They are also well poised to transition research to applications: China has, for example, developed large primate colonies for preclinical testing, and have already begun clinical trials for a number of therapies (see Box 4.3). China also has an enormous, supportive population that provides the disease base on which to conduct clinical trials. Experts believe this focus on therapy will help make them an international leader in RM: \"I trust on the R&D and the clinical application, [that] we will become one of the leaders in this work,\" [Interview CH8]. 113 Box 4.3. Primate facilities: a key resource for China's regenerative medicine sector. The availability of quality animal models for RM product testing is an essential resource for the transfer of medical products and procedures from lab to clinic. China has developed large, highquality primate facilities for the preclinical testing of RM products. The primate facility at Kunming Institute of Zoology (Kunming) houses 1500 rhesus monkeys and an additional few hundred monkeys of other species (Hao 2007). A primate company launched in 2003 in Nanning called Wincon TheraCells Biotechnology breeds 2000 cynomolgus macaques each year. Some of these monkeys are developed to mimic human diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, and diabetes for testing cellular therapies. This facility is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, an international nonprofit group that promotes humane treatment of laboratory animals (Hao 2007). Quality animal models and preclinical testing facilities are in demand globally and may attract international researchers to China, promoting partnerships and collaborations between research groups. 4.3.3 Challenges to RM in China 4.3.3.1 Regulatory concerns According to this research, China's RM field clearly has strengths but equally faces significant challenges. For example, the guidelines for embryonic research in China have generated international criticism. Because they are guidelines only, they have limited authority over researchers and are not legally binding. Adherence to these rules is enforced only for those who receive funding from the government, which includes most researchers. Financially independent researchers or hospitals must simply answer to their own institution's ethical review board. It is feared that without more comprehensive oversight or firmer regulations, these guidelines may be 114 circumvented. Interviewees stated that enforcement of regulations are a key concern: \"We do not have the mature process to examine, so we're not really sure if [the regulations] were implemented totally or not...it is difficult to know whether the policy has been carried out completely because we do not have the examination to really verify,\" [Interview CH4]. Some of the top stem cell researchers in China have stated that despite this, they consider the stem cell guidelines to be adequate and binding (Cheng, Qiu et al. 2006). One interviewee stated \"Right now the regulation is, I think it's fine. And I fully support the regulation,\" [Interview CH6]. Manipulated stem cells and cells that are proliferated for multiple patient use are considered drugs once they have passed the research phase and are being clinically applied. Their application then requires approval from the SFDA. The MOH is responsible for new clinical procedures that fall outside the regulation of the SFDA. My review of Chinese regulation and the interviews suggest that one-to-one patient transplantation of un-manipulated stem cells extracted from cord blood or bone marrow currently falls outside the jurisdiction of the SFDA and previous to May 2009 was not considered a novel therapy by the MOH because it has already been approved for use in the treatment of other diseases, such as bone-marrow transplant for leukaemia. Treatment centres were therefore not required to undergo clinical trials with either the SFDA or MOH, even though efficacy has not been established for the diseases they treat. This has made it possible for the treatment centres to move to treatment early on in the development of the field, but has also hurt the credibility of stem cell therapies in China (Cheng, Qiu et al. 2006; Dobkin, Curt et al. 2006). As of 1 May, 2009, all stem cell therapies have been classified in China as a Category 3 medical technology, indicating they require proof of safety and efficacy by clinical trial. Gene therapy is already a member of this category, which is directly regulated by the MOH. It is as yet unclear if these new regulations can be circumvented or if they apply to companies that provide stem cells and patients to hospitals, such as Beike Biotechnology 115 (Cyranoski 2009), but these regulatory changes could effect the availability of stem cell therapies. 4.3.3.2 Unproven therapies There is currently insufficient scientific examination of available stem cell treatments to conclusively decide their efficacy. The conflicting results published from patient cases at the Beijing Xishan Institute for Neuroregeneration and Functional Recovery, for example, show a pressing need for more systematic evaluation of all new stem cell treatments. Clinical trials of these types of therapies, such as the ChinaSCINet trial, may be able to shed light on their therapeutic merit. Critics have not necessarily questioned the potential of stem cell therapies for treating degenerative disease in the future, but rather felt that the liberal regulations of stem cell therapy in China prior to May 2009 had created a loophole in which treatments could avoid rigorous safety and efficacy testing, and that allowed potentially harmful therapies to market (Dobkin, Curt et al. 2006). As such, top Chinese researchers have protested that these centres are acting 'against commonly accepted principles of modern scientific research' and called on the government to ensure patient safety and regulate the efficacy of new treatments (Cheng, Qiu et al. 2006). This is a matter of international importance, as increasing numbers of foreign patients are travelling to China to seek unproven stem cell therapies not available in their home countries. The ISSCR strongly condemns the administration of unproven stem cell therapies in their Guidelines for the Clinical Translation of Stem Cells and has written a handbook to help doctors and patients make informed decisions about available stem cell therapies (ISSCR 2009). Interviewees acknowledged that these nonevidence- based therapies hurt the credibility of researchers interested in following international scientific standards: \"It's a very bad, very bad image for Chinese in this field. So I think the government really should have tight regulations 116 regarding clinical applications,\" [Interview CH12 ] It may be in large part due to these national and international pressures that the MOH revised and tightened the regulation of stem cell therapies. 4.3.3.3 Lagging basic research China's push for clinical applications is one of its strengths and has allowed China to produce new scientific knowledge quickly in this field, but this comes at a cost to basic research in China. This has been previously suggested by Salter in 2006 (Salter, Cooper et al. 2006) and Chinese researchers still believe basic research aimed at overcoming technical challenges such as controlling how stem cells behave and differentiate is lagging in China and may hold back applied research in the long term. One stem cell researcher stated: \"In terms of basic research on regenerative medicine I feel we lack, I think we lag behind,\" [Interview CH6]. Only 5.2% of China's budget for research and development is allocated to basic research, compared with 13-19% in Japan, Korea and the USA (Ministry of Science and Technology 2007a). Even the funds allocated for basic research favor 'strategic basic research' designed to encourage application. 4.3.3.4 International skepticism Another challenge to RM in China, stressed by my interviewees, is the international skepticism of scientific results coming from Asia. International credibility is not a struggle uniquely for RM, but common to the biotechnology field in China (Frew, Sammut et al. 2008). One interviewee confirmed that China has been struggling with increased incidents of academic fraud and scientific misconduct, including falsification of resumes, plagiarism and fabrication of data. Some of my interviewees believe that international journals are mistrustful of Chinese scientific integrity and seem to be skeptical of highly innovative discoveries in the stem cell field coming 117 from China. For example, journals held up publication of Hui Zhen Sheng's results of her rabbit oocyte and skin cell chimera for over 2 years (dti Global 2004; Mandavilli 2006). Although there have not yet been any major Chinese stem cell scandals, the Korean Hwang Woo-Suk stem cell line forgery has likely done much to taint the reputation of stem cell research in Asia. A further challenge for Chinese stem cell research relates to scandals involving the SFDA. The head of SFDA Zheng Xiaoyu was executed in 2007 on charges of corruption after accepting bribes to approve drugs, which may have compromised international faith in China's regulatory system. International acceptance is very important if China is going to contribute globally to the field of RM. As one interviewee stated: \"International recognition means that thing is real, is true,\" [Interview 34]. 4.4 Conclusion This analysis reveals that China has built an active and innovative RM sector. China's design for fostering innovation combines four key elements: strategic government funding, permissive regulations, a focus on application and a highly educated workforce built by attracting scientific diaspora trained at the foremost stem cell research centres in the world. These different strategies have been well aligned, resulting in a rapid capacity-building of the stem cell field in the country. In particular, the attraction of scientific diaspora to China has resulted in a workforce that is both highly educated and closely connected to major global centres in RM research. This is a lesson other developing countries can consider as they commonly have many of their nationals at eminent centres of learning outside their countries. Some of these key elements are double edged. For example, permissive regulations lend both a comparative advantage to China as well as being a source of international controversy. The focus on application may come at the expense of fundamental research and a better integration between basic and applied research could help 118 move stem cell research forward in China. The translation of new therapies needs a clear regulatory path, and China should be included in international discourse on translational standards. There is also currently a complete disconnect between applied research and those providing therapy. The new need for clinical testing of stem cell therapies may bridge the interests of academics and industry, and facilitate the transition of research from the lab to the clinic, as well as help define the role of stem cell therapy centres that are currently operating. These new regulations may in time help restore international confidence in Chinese stem cell innovations, but it will take time to evaluate their impact. RM research in China is a subject of national pride and the Chinese feel that their discoveries can help move global research toward clinical solutions. In the words of one stem cell expert: \"We don't want to just copy other research, we want to do something innovative. The leaders are first class researchers, they impact the field ... we want to be first class, to have an impact,\" [Interview 17]. If China continues to build on its strengths and overcome its challenges, China's push towards clinical applications makes 'impact' a likely future reality. 4.5 References Abbott, A., Dennis, C., Ledford, H. and Smith, K.

Here I present a comprehensive case study of RM in Brazil, including analysis of current activity, main motivations for engaging in RM, and the remaining challenges to development in this field. This case study is primarily based on semi-structured interviews with experts on RM in Brazil including researchers, policy makers, clinicians, representatives of firms, and regulators. Driven by domestic health needs and strategic government support, Brazil is producing innovative RM research, particularly for clinical research in cardiology, orthopaedics, diabetes, and neurology. I describe the main RM research currently taking place in Brazil, as well as some of the economic, regulatory and policy events that have created a favorable environment for RM development. 1 This Chapter is published as: McMahon, D.S., Daar, A.S., Singer, P.A., Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir, but publication is available here: http://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/pdf/10.2217/rme.10.76 \u00a9 2010 Dominique McMahon, Abdallah Daar, Peter Singer and Halla Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir.

McMahon contributed significantly to all aspects of this publication, including the majority of the data collection, analysis, and manuscript preparation. 124 Brazilian RM researchers need to overcome several formidable challenges to research: research funding is inconsistent, importation of materials is costly and slow, and weak linkages between universities, hospitals and industry impede translational research. Even though Brazil's contribution to the RM sector is small, its niche emphasis on clinical applications may become of global importance, particularly if they manage to address the challenges currently impinging on RM innovation. 5.2 Introduction Although Brazil has historically focused health research investments on tropical medicine and parasitology, growth in the new emerging field of RM, including stem cell research, gene therapy and tissue engineering has been evident over the last decade. In a previous study comparing RM capacity in low and middle income countries, I identified Brazil as one of three countries that had activity across five categories: dedicated government funding, goods and services, firms, publications, and academic groups (Greenwood, Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir et al. 2006). RM is still a young field in Brazil, but as I will show in this chapter, the country has made significant advances in the treatment of diabetes, stroke, bone regeneration, and heart disease. For example, in 2003, Brazil conducted the world's first clinical trial using bone-marrow stem cells injections to treat 21 patients with advanced heart failure (Perin, Dohmann et al. 2003). Following the positive results of this trial, Brazil initiated a $US 6 million stem cell trial for cardiac disease (Leite 2006; Tura, Martino et al. 2007). Brazil's clinical research on stem cells has already influenced developments in other countries: the Texas Heart Institute also continued testing the Brazilian protocol in the first FDA-approved clinical trial of stem cell heart therapy in the United States (Texas Heart Institute 2004). 125 Even with these high-profile clinical developments, stem cell research has not been without controversy in Brazil. The merit of embryonic stem cell research was debated for four years in Brazil's highest courts before embryonic stem cell research was legally supported in 2008. The government then renewed its commitment to stem cell research by investing RS$21 million (US$12 million) in the development of eight stem cell centres (Squizato 2008). While Brazil has shouldered both important stem cell clinical trials and a high-profile embryonic stem cell legal battle, there is nonetheless a paucity of information on Brazil's RM sector. Here I present a comprehensive case study of RM in Brazil based on primary empirical data. My analysis provides insight into the current RM activity in Brazil, the main motivations for engaging in RM, and the key challenges for further development in this field. This is the first such analysis of Brazil's RM field. This research should be of interest to those interested in keeping abreast of international biomedical research, as well as those policy makers involved in stimulating innovative developments in RM both within Brazil and abroad. 5.3 Methods Please see Chapter 3 for methodology. 5.4 Results & discussion 5.4.1 Overview of RM research in Brazil This case study shows that RM is a nascent field in Brazil that has grown considerably over the last decade. Publications on stem cells have increased steadily from 15 publications in 2000 to 213 in 2009, but are still modest in comparison to leaders in the field (Figure 5.1). Brazilian RM activity is centralized within several dozen organizations in only a handful of cities (Figure 5.2). 126 Figure 5.1. Number of stem cell publications by year and by country. (A) Rise in Brazilian stem cell publications in international peer-reviewed journals from 2000-2009. (B) Publications on stem cells in international peer-reviewed journals from select countries in 2009. Numbers above the bars indicate worldwide ranking for each country in terms of stem cell publication levels in international peer-reviewed journals. 127 Most of the RM research activity in Brazil is confined to Brazil's two largest and richest cities, S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Brazil's capital city, Bras\u00edlia, does not conduct much research in RM but is home to Brazil's federal funding, policy and regulatory agencies. Although the RM field in Brazil is small, its success seems to be largely propelled forward by a group of highly trained and dedicated researchers. Several of these researchers are involved in multiple facets of RM, including basic research, clinical work, and entrepreneurial activities. Below I describe the contributions of academic institutions, hospitals and firms to Brazilian RM R&D. Figure 5.2: Map of main regenerative medicine activities in Brazil. 5.4.1.1 The role of academic institutions According to my analysis, public universities and affiliated research institutions are the most prolific knowledge producer in Brazil's RM sector and conduct most of the sector's R&D. The 128 majority of the clinical trials in RM are lead by those with tight associations to academia, and many of the new firms are university spin-offs. Interviewees indicated that private universities in Brazil generally do not engage in research, with the exception of some Catholic universities that engage in adult stem cell research only. While universities are active in several areas of RM - including stem cell research, tissue engineering and gene therapy - stem cell research is the most prominent. Nonetheless, it seems that pre-clinical and clinical trials are beginning in gene therapy, and some tissue engineering projects are also underway, particularly in orthopaedics. A few highlights of Brazilian RM research are presented Table 5.1, and two innovative studies are illustrated in Box 5.1 and Box 5.2. Note that this is not an exhaustive list of Brazilian researchers. Table 5.1 Examples RM research in Brazil's academic institutions.

Julio Voltarelli of the Center for Cell Based Therapy at the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Hemocentro in Ribeir\u00e3o Preto conducted the world's first stem cell treatment for type 1 diabetes mellitus. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disorder in which the body destroys insulinproducing pancreatic beta cells. The innovative technique protects remaining insulinproducing bcells, rebuilding the patient's immune system with autologous bonemarrow stem cells. After harvesting the patient's bonemarrow stem cells, Voltarelli's patients underwent highdose immunosuppression to destroy much of their immune system. The harvested cells are then injected back into the patients in order to rebuild the immune system. Voltarelli's team reported that 14 out of 15 individuals treated became insulin independent as a result of the treatment (Voltarelli, Couri et al. 2007). A followup study published in April 2009 confirmed that 12 out of 20 patients remained insulin free (mean: 31 months), and the eight that had relapsed only required low doses of insulin (Couri, Oliveira et al. 2009). This represents the first treatment of any kind that allows type 1 diabetic patients to achieve longterm insulin independence without constant immunosuppression, and is the only treatment that impedes the progression of type 1 diabetes in humans. Box 5.2. Stroke research in Brazil. Rio de Janeiro's MendezOtero has treated over 45 stroke patients with stem cells in an innovative Phase I clinical trial. MendezOtero explains that the damaged area surrounding the cells lost by stroke can be rescued or protected by the injected bonemarrow cells.\" The idea is that these cells get to the region that is damaged by the stroke\", says MendezOtero, who has shown the shortterm safety of this therapy in humans and the localization of these cells 131 to the area of the brain affected by the stroke (De Freitas, Mendon\u00e7a et al. 2006; da Fonseca, Mirian et al. 2010). This therapy has also significantly increased recovery of sensorimotor function in rats [31], and MendezOtero looks forward to fully testing the scientific benefits of this therapy in humans in future Phase II and III clinical trials. 5.4.1.2 The role of hospitals Brazil has initiated a large-scale clinical trial on heart disease known as the MiHeart trial, involving a network of over 30 hospitals (Box 5.3). Aside from the MiHeart trial, only a handful of other hospitals appear to have completed or initiated clinical trials in RM, and all have close associations with public academic institutions. A representative from Pr\u00f3-Card\u00edaco, one of the main hospitals conducting RM R&D, indicated the hospital has completed clinical trials for three indications: chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy, acute myocardial infarction and acute stroke. The Ministry of Health provides some grant funding for RM therapy clinical trials and directly funds the MiHeart trial. Box 5.3. Treating heart disease with stem cell injections. Brazil's largest clinical stem cell trial, the MiHeart Trial (also known as the Cell Therapy in Myocardial Infarction trial or EMRTCC), was the largest stem cell clinical trial in the world, and one of only a few stem cell clinical trials on heart disease, when it began in 2005. Approximately 1200 patients were enrolled in the Phase II/III multisite randomized doubleblinded placebocontrolled clinical trial (Tura, Martino et 2007). The trial is cocordinated by Antonio Carlos Campos de Carvalho at the National Cardiology Institute in Rio de Janeiro and tests the efficacy of stem cells to treat four types of cardiopathy: 1) dilated cardiomyopathy, 2) chagastic cardiomyopathy 3)chronic ischemic heart disease 4) acute ischemic heart disease. Each arm of the trial enrolls approximately 300 patients and is cocordinated by an anchor hospital that operates within a network of more than 30 hospitals across Brazil (Leite 2006). 132 5.4.1.3 The role of firms My analysis shows that Brazil has a number of firms involved in RM, although these firms are small and quite new - not surprising since RM has only begun to build commercial opportunities globally.

This table was sent to all the interviewees for verification prior to publication 133 Most of these RM firms are university spin-offs that maintain strong links with academic institutions or academicians. Several firms supply and service the RM industry, while others are directly developing products and therapies. Many of my interviewees were unaware of these firms, reflecting the low visibility of private sector activity in RM. The best-known firms were Excellion and Cellpraxis 5.4.2 The motivations behind RM research in Brazil My analysis shows that the primary motivation for the government and researchers to pursue RM is to create products and services that will treat Brazil's domestic health problems. Brazil's governmental support for RM has been instrumental to its quick development and has helped to spur this field forwards. Interviewees indicated that they felt developing treatments in Brazil will lower health care costs and ensure the availability of new RM treatments in Brazil. 5.4.2.1 Developing treatments for shifting health needs RM may hold the solutions to increasingly prevalent chronic and non-communicable disease burden in Brazil. The health landscape in Brazil has changed significantly over the last century: whereas infectious and parasitic diseases were the cause of 46% of all deaths in 1930, they represent 5 % of deaths in 2005. Cardiovascular disease increased almost three-fold in the same time period and currently represent 32% of mortality in Brazil (Minist\u00e9rio da Sa\u00fade 2008; Polanczyk and Ribeiro 2009). In addition to chronic conditions, RM may help treat the complications of Chagas disease, an infectious tropical disease endemic to Brazil. Patients with Chagas risk developing long-term heart damage, damage that may be treatable with stem cells and which is currently being tested in the MiHeart trial. Many interviewees believe Brazil has a social responsibility to work in RM, 134 in addition to their more traditional role in tropical medicine and vaccine development, if Brazil's health needs are to be addressed: \"The fact is that Brazil is not anymore a rural country. Most of the people live in cities. They have urban pathology and they have urban problems,\" [Interview BR8]. Several interviewees felt that Brazil has the domestic scientific expertise to contribute to RM, but felt that if they didn't invest in RM now, Brazil would loose its opportunity to participate in RM. In the words of one researcher: \"We cannot wait to solve these basic problems with vaccination in order to start then working with regenerative medicine...And if we just stay here trying to vaccinate our population before we start investing on that, we'll end up having to send our patients away or buy very expensive therapies from abroad.\" [Interview BR33] 5.4.2.2 RM spurred by government support According to the interviewees, government support at both the federal and state level has been instrumental to the development of Brazilian RM. The Ministry of Health in particular sees RM as a potential solution to rising rates of chronic disease and has prioritized funding to RM R&D. Between 2005 and 2009, the government has spent US$24.7 million on stem cell research, accounting for approximately a tenth of its spending on biomedical science (Leite 2009). Most funding for RM comes through the federal government's National Council for Scientific and Technology (CNPq), although state science and technology funding agencies have also significantly contributed to RM research (see Figure 5.3). Funds are available as general grants available for any subject area, or as sectoral grants for predetermined research areas. There have been two main calls specific to stem cell research: the first was launched in 2005 just after the 135 approval of embryonic stem cell research, and the second launched in 2008, immediately following the Supreme Court decision to continue support for embryonic stem cell research. Figure 5.3. Main government funding agencies for regenerative medicine. The main science funding organization for research, CNPq, distributes funds from both the Ministry of Health (Minist\u00e9rio da Sa\u00fade) and the MCT. Strategic health funding, such as dedicated funding for RM, is often determined by the DECIT at the Ministry of Health and may be matched by the MCT. Most states of Brazil have a state-funding agency for Science and Technology, all beginning with FAPE and followed by the state name initials; FAPESP in S\u00e3o Paulo is the strongest of these agencies. Other federal agencies that fund RM research include CAPES at the MEC for student training and awards, and from the FINEP for infrastructure improvements or commercialization activities. [CAPES: Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento de Pessoal de N\u00edvel Superior; CNPq: The Foundation for Research Support of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico); DECIT: and Technology (Departamento de Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia); FAPESP: The Foundation for Research Support of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Technology (Minist\u00e9rio da Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia); MEC: Ministry of Education (Minist\u00e9rio da Educa\u00e7\u00e3o).] In addition to these funding calls, two network grants have been instrumental to the development of RM in Brazil: the \"Tissue Bioengineering: Cell therapies for Chronic Degenerative Disease\" 136 network was funded in 2002, and a gene therapy network was funded in 2005 (Millenium Science Initiative 2005). Several interviewees felt that although short, this network approach was highly successful and productive, particularly for cell therapy research: \"It was certainly the most successful program that I participated in ... we went from bench to bedside in three years,\" [Interview BR28]. Members of this stem cell network were disappointed when their funding was discontinued in 2005, but a new network, \"The National Network of Cell Therapy\", was funded in 2008 (see Box 5.4), showing a renewed government commitment to stem cell research. Box 5.4. Brazil funds a new network of stem cell therapy centres. In late 2008, the Brazilian government committed US$12 million over a 2-3year period to establish a new national network of stem cell centres (Squizato 2008). The main purpose of these centres is to produce clinical good manufacturing practices and protocols to generate cells that could eventually be used in a clinical setting. Known as the National Network of Cell Therapy, or Rede Nacional de Terapia Celular, the network consists of over 50 projects in eight national centres across five cities in four states. Each institution in this network grant will help derive, produce and evaluate several stem cell types, and will act as a source for those cells for the country. According to DECIT at the Ministry of Health, the network was created following a survey they conducted in 2008, which determined that consistent access to clinicalquality cells would be a major barrier if translation of stem cells into therapy was successful 5.4.3 Events that shaped RM development My analysis shows that several major factors have recently made Brazil a favorable place for biomedical innovation such as RM. These factors include public support for stem cell research following a long legal debate, new economic stability, a rebuilding of biotechnology capacity after radical changes to intellectual property rights, and new government policies to promote 137 scientific innovation. Below I describe the context and main influences of these events on the development of Brazilian RM. 5.4.3.1 Deliberation over hESCs My analysis shows that while legal debate over hESCs caused financial government support of embryonic stem cell research to waver, discussions of stem cell technology during the debate lead to their widespread public support. Box 5.5. Stem cell regulations in Brazil. Enacted in March 2005, the Biosecurity Law simply states the conditions under which research on human embryos is permitted, but places an absolute limit on the number of quality embryos available to research. Article 5 of Law number 11.105 allows the use of discarded embryos produced from in vitro fertilization for \"research and therapeutic purposes,\" with parental consent. Article 6 prohibits genetic engineering of embryo germinal cells, performing human cloning or the sale of any human embryonic materials. Both reproductive and therapeutic human cloning are also prohibited. Article 5 also specifies that embryos must either be unviable or must have been frozen for a minimum of 3 years before March 2008 (Brazil 2005). This stipulation limits the total number of highquality embryos available to researchers. Several of the interviewed stem cell researchers were concerned that this restriction may need to be changed once currently authorized embryo stores are depleted, particularly if the government still wishes to aggressively pursue stem cell research and development, but that the number of usable embryos was sufficient for their current research. 138 Human embryonic research was first legalized in the Bio-security Law of 2005 (see Box 5.5). Despite the strong presence of the Catholic Church in Brazil - which is vocally opposed to embryonic stem cell research on the basis that it destroys life - the bio-security bill was supported by 96% of senators and 85% of congressman (Zatz 2009). The law caused a backlash by the Church and was legally challenged by then attorney general Claudio Fonteles on the basis that the law went against Brazil's constitutional guarantee of the right to life (Fonteles 2005). The Brazilian Supreme Court launched a public consultation on the issue - its first ever in the institution's 178 year history - and invited researchers, policy makers, religious leaders and members of the public to voice their opinions (Marques 2007). The challenge was resolved by Brazil's Supreme Court on May 29th, 2008 with a 6-5 vote in favor of upholding the Bio-security Law with no amendments. During the legal debate over embryonic stem cell research, government funding for stem cells was officially available, but its political support for embryonic stem cell research seemed reserved. A call for grant applications specific to stem cell research was made following enactment of the Bio-security Law, but despite that embryonic research in Brazil had just been authorized, only three of 41 approved projects used embryonic stem cells, and the projects of several prominent researchers were dismissed (Leite 2006). Some felt that the low approval of embryonic stem cell projects was due to bias created by the presence of a priest on the selection committee. Eleven principal investigators appealed their verdicts, after which the selection committee approved an additional three projects (Leite 2006). This research shows that while financial support for stem cells was reserved during the debate, the government immediately increased dedicated financial resources for stem cells following the Supreme Court verdict, indicating their renewed commitment to this field. 139 The Brazilian public now appears highly supportive of stem cell research, likely due to the promulgation of scientific information by mainstream media. The intensity of this coverage during the Supreme Court debate is nearly unprecedented in Brazil; in the words of Jurber et al., \"never before have Brazilian media realized such a wide coverage of science communication in a short period of time,\" (Jurberg, Verjovsky et al. 2009). In an analysis of Brazilian media articles, most stem cell coverage conveyed medical or scientific information, generally presented optimistically, with few articles predominantly focused on ethical issues (Reis 2008). This favorable portrayal by the media seems consistent with popular opinion in Brazil at that time. A survey conducted by Brazil's largest polling agency IBOPE Intelig\u00eancia in January 2008 -just prior to the Supreme Court ruling - showed about 75% of the Brazil citizens fully support the use of human embryos for research, with another 20% partially supporting and only 2% completely opposed (IBOPE Intelig\u00eancia 2008). Many interviewees agreed that while Brazil is mostly Catholic, Brazilians generally support medical research - particularly for no-option diseases - and believe that quality of life supersedes the Church's position on hESC research. 5.4.3.2 Economic crisis and stability Several of the interviewees believe that the last decade of economic stability following a period of economic turmoil has recently favored investment in fields like RM. During the 1980s and 1990s, Brazil economy was shaken by economic instability and record high inflation - which rose up to 2000% - and it wasn't until the economic reform of 1994 that these rates decreased to a more reasonable 5% (Almeida, Travassos et al. 2000; Marques 2003). During the economic crisis, domestic investments were high risk compared to investments in foreign currency. My interviewees indicated that consequently, investors in Brazil had been for many decades characterized as low risk taking and industry had avoided R&D activities. After over a decade of 140 restored stability, investors are said to be beginning to find longer-term investments more appealing. These longer-term investments are critical to new higher risk biomedical fields such as RM, and new political and financial motivation to develop these types of research may have helped kick-start RM in Brazil. While these shifting attitudes have been favorable to RM development, this research indicates private investments are still hard to acquire for new medical biotechnologies, likely because most research is still conducted in public research institutes, which have few ties to industry. 5.4.3.3 Impact of new intellectual property laws My interview data indicate that Brazil's implementation of the international Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) came at a great cost to the development of biotechnology in Brazil. Administered by the Word Trade Organization, the TRIPS agreement sets out the international standards of intellectual property protection. Prior to implementation of the TRIPS agreement, patenting of pharmaceuticals was prohibited in Brazil; Brazil's active pharmaceutical industry depended extensively on copying foreign technologies and had little motivation to develop endogenous innovation (Buainain, de Souza et al.). After signing the TRIPS agreement on May 14th, 1996, Brazil chose to forsake the ten-year transition period offered to developing countries and to instead fully implement the TRIPS agreement by the following year. Although barely discussed in the literature, several of the interviewees indicated this one-year transition was likely insufficient for firms to adjust and resulted in a mass closure of Brazilian pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies (also see Antunes, Basso et al. 2008). Suddenly unable to copy foreign technologies, \"firms had to innovate or to die, and so most died,\" [Interview Br1]. Several interviewees felt that if a longer timeframe was available, firms with domestic technical expertise may have been better able to incorporate R&D into their 141 business models to begin to innovate, leaving more firms with the expertise and infrastructure necessary for high-tech medical innovation. While the implementation of TRIPS may have caused biotechnology in Brazil a significant setback, the biotechnology industry has grown considerably in recent years and increasingly appears to be interested in developing emerging biomedical technologies like RM (Ferrer, Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir et al. 2004; Rezaie, Frew et al. 2008). 5.4.3.4 Innovation Law and the Law of Good Two major legislative changes in Brazil have been designed to kick start scientific innovation in Brazil and bridge public research and industry: the Lei do Bem (Law of Good) and the Innovation Law. Approved in December of 2004, the Innovation Law encourages partnerships between public research and industry and incentivises innovation in private companies. The Law of Good of 2005 provides fiscal and tax incentives for firms investing in research and innovation. We found the most noticeable difference on the ground to be the sharing of employees, funding, and facilities between private and public institutions, activities that were previously difficult or prohibited. These new policies allow publicly funded researchers to form spin-off firms, which is currently the main model of RM commercialization in Brazil. Both of these new government policies should help create better ties between industry and academia in RM. Still, some interviewees indicated that these policies lack the 'teeth' necessary to overcome all of the cultural separation between academia and industry in Brazil. 5.4.4 Challenges moving forward Brazil has made important progress in RM, but seems to be straining to increase the size and strength of its RM program. Brazil has limited resources compared to its global competitors and struggles to overcome a number of challenges, several of which are detailed in this section: 142 inconsistent financing, importation costs and delays, limited confidence in Brazilian innovation, and weak linkages between researchers, hospitals and industry. While several of these challenges may not be faced uniquely by those involved in RM, each will be important to RM's successful development and adoption. 5.4.4.1 Inconsistent financing creates short-term goals Most interviewees felt that although current funding levels are sufficient, funding inconsistency was a major barrier to RM research. Prioritization of scientific funding is at the discretion of current political will and grants are typically small and short - of one to two years. The instability of funding is detrimental to Brazilian science: \"So, it tends to make you start thinking ... in the short term. And I think that's the major shortcoming of Brazilian science. We are led into using our own intellectual abilities to think short term, and so we have difficulty planning for the long term.\" [Interview BR31] While funding inconsistency is in general a problem in Brazil, FAPESP - the state funded R&D agency for S\u00e3o Paulo - is widely seen as successful due to the consistent financing it provides. FAPESP receives a fixed percentage of state taxes, which is not liable to change with succeeding governments. This science funding stability has made S\u00e3o Paulo one of the leading hubs of research in the country, attracting highly trained researchers, and accumulating much of the high-tech scientific equipment in the country. 5.4.4.2 Importation costs and delays. According to the interviews, the speed and cost associated with importation of scientific equipment and research materials are key barriers to research productivity in Brazil. Researchers 143 complained that bureaucracy and red tape create waiting times of several months to a year for imported products. These same materials could be obtained same day or overnight in the United States, putting Brazilian biomedical research at a severe disadvantage. In the words of one interviewee \"Basically we cannot compete with [developed countries], because if I ask for a reagent here it takes six months to come\" [Interview BR27]. Wait times are a result of the paperwork, inefficient regulations, and red tape required to receive exemption of import taxes for scientific materials. To avoid importation delays, some more common products are imported and stocked by domestic companies for resale, but importation tariffs make the costs of these products prohibitive and can alone account for 50-60% of the final product price (Chiarella 2004). In a cost comparison of equipment and materials across four countries, Schillinger found products cost up to 70% more in Brazil than the United States for 11 of the 12 materials surveyed (Schillinger 2004). In a correspondence to that article, a Brazilian stem cell researcher noted that even materials donated to Brazil from developed countries can cost more to import than their original purchase price, and may be delayed by red tape for up to a year (Rehen 2004). The combination of long wait times and fluctuations in currency exchange rates can further affect the value of grants and complicate negotiations with foreign equipment providers. These importation delays have not gone completely unnoticed by the regulatory agencies in Brazil. In late 2007, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva passed a bill requesting the Ministries of Health and the Ministry of Science & Technology to speed up importation of scientific materials (Rebelo 2008). In response, the Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Vigil\u00e2ncia Sanit\u00e1ria (ANVISA) now treats scientific imports similarly to perishable goods. This has greatly improved the speed with which imports for science are processed once they reach the country - from several weeks to several 144 days - but has only marginally decreased total wait times from their first request. Several interviewees reported that even after these changes, importation red tap and quotas are still one of the largest barriers to innovative research in Brazil. 5.4.4.3 Lack of confidence in Brazilian RM innovation Most interviewees felt that Brazil's capacity to conduct innovative high-tech science is underestimated by the global community. In the words of one interviewee: \"I think now we must change this image, this picture, this painting of Brazil. We must dissociate the image of easy sex and the beaches only, to acknowledge the possibility to develop new technologies.\" [Interview BR7] Many interviewees strongly felt that journals discriminated based on country address, requiring higher publication standards, questioning the facility infrastructure and ethical guidance available, and seldom inviting review publications. Several interviewees found that publications were easier when they were working abroad, or if co-authored with a colleague from a developed country. One interviewee stated: \"If someone comes from an undeveloped country, they don't see it with good eyes. First they don't believe what you did or you know, or say that it's not good enough, just from the origin of the paper; it will not be good if it comes from Brazil.\" [Interview BR27] Concerns of publication and citation bias against developing countries are not new. There is evidence that co-authored papers from South America with developed country colleagues are cited at a much higher rate than those solely authored by South American researchers in 145 prestigious scientific journals, although the reasons for this discrepancy are not clear (Meneghini, Packer et al. 2008). A few of the industry representatives I interviewed indicated that they felt products developed in Brazil have a more difficult time gaining global consumer confidence. While developing a RM product for export, one interviewee lamented: \"For example to go to the US market, we were thinking would it be best to get there with our product saying 'Made in the US' [instead of 'Made in Brazil']...On my box. On my package... Because we want our product to be successful.\" [Interview BR42] Discrimination against Brazilian products was felt to be a domestic issue as well. Some interviewees reported that doctors were hesitant to use home-grown science and therapies until similar products emerged on the international market. 5.4.4.4 Weak linkages between RM stake-holders According to most of the interviewees, researchers in public institutes perceive a negative stigma associated with patenting and commercialization. This might explain why despite a recent governmental push to increase patenting, researchers have been slow to adopt intellectual property protection of their work. Brazil produces about 1.7% of the world's publications, but only 0.2% of the world's patents (Moreira 2007). According to my analysis, of 62 patents on stem cells deposited on the public patent database at INPI, only 6 patents were submitted by a Brazilian organization. According to a Brazilian IP expert, few researchers or university graduates receive lessons on intellectual property, hindering the establishment of an IP culture and delaying the development of bench to bedside health technologies. My interview data indicate Brazil is also painfully short on experienced contract negotiators in the biomedical field 146 for patent licensing or tech transfer negotiations. These contract negotiations can currently take years, further isolating research and industry. Although still low, recent increases in patenting among researchers have stemmed from greater awareness, increased university services to help patent process, and a need to increase domestic ownership of IP in order to increase local access to technology. One interviewee was told by a colleague \"Come on, be aware that you are giving things away and you are losing strategic things, not for you but for our country.\" [Interview BR23]. My interview data indicate that most hospitals in Brazil do not have a strong involvement in R&D. Academics and clinicians alike claim that hospital boards and doctors have limited interest in conducting or participating in clinical research. Drug trials in Brazil are traditionally financed by either international or domestic pharmaceutical companies, which see limited potential for marketable products in RM. Little support from industry and weak relationships between academic institutions and hospitals has made funding for large-scale clinical trials difficult to secure, even following positive results of initial small-scale trials. Interviewees also indicated that finding a skilled and committed team to conduct trials is challenging. One interviewee speaking on this topic emphasized the important role clinical teams must play if Brazil is going to be able to develop new to the world technologies. \"We had a lot of clinical protocols stopped because we don't have clinical teams to do it. We have the technology, we have the ideas, we have the protocols written, we have everything to do. What we need is a clinical team, innovative clinical team to apply this, to innovate in Brazil first the technology.\" [Interview BR7] 147 My analysis identified several other challenges to innovation in RM in addition to those fully described above. Several interviewees indicated that university researchers' salaries are fixed and paid independently of research, and so researchers need to be largely self-motivated to excel. New public sector jobs including university appointments are difficult to create, resulting in few new positions for PhD graduates. Some interviewees involved in research or commercialization of RM complain that regulatory agencies such as ANVISA and the Comiss\u00e3o de \u00c9tica em Pesquisa (CONEP) are still slow, highly bureaucratic, and lack specialized scientific training, causing inconsistencies and long administrative delays. 5.5 Conclusions Brazil has a lot to gain from RM. RM could help treat locally important diseases and it is clear that many researchers feel that taking part in the development of RM therapies early on is the best way to assure that Brazil will have access to any new cost effective treatments. This analysis shows that although small, Brazil's focus on niche areas of RM - cardiology, orthopaedics and neurology - has allowed researchers to build on the domestic expertise and make important steps towards the development of clinical treatments. Current RM capacity has been built on the back of supportive policy and generous funding, and consistent long-term governmental support for RM will be essential to its long-term productivity. Brazil's publications on stem cells remain modest compared to China, but are much closer to the publication levels of India. Government support has been integral to the successful development of the RM field in all three countries. Although Brazil is investing a significant portion of its health funding in RM, levels are still low compared to developed countries were larger financial 148 resources are available. In order to use its limited resources effectively, it will be essential for Brazil to address the significant challenges facing RM researchers. Most of these barriers I have discussed are not unique to RM, and changes could additionally have positive externalities for other science and technology fields. For example, all life scientist researchers are undoubtedly challenged by inconsistent financing and by slow and costly importations. Challenges created by the insular development of research in public sector institutes would benefit from greater collaboration between hospitals, academic institutes and industry. It appears that Brazilian policy makers are aware of some of these barriers: the innovation law was designed to increase ties between industry and research, and steps have been taken to decrease importation times. Nonetheless, stronger efforts are required to overcome these challenges if Brazilian RM is to be globally competitive. It is a good time for RM in Brazil. The Supreme Court has supported embryonic stem cell research, new government funding will help grow current research projects and will provide the new infrastructure to transfer treatments to the clinic, while the population's understanding and support of RM will help the uptake of any new therapies. The need for RM, too, is great. With approximately a third of mortality in Brazil attributed to chronic conditions, RM holds promise to help treat conditions with currently few good medical options. Brazil has a lot to gain if RM developments are successful - scientifically, economically, and socially - but will need to maintain its international competitiveness in this quickly growing field if RM therapy is going to be locally affordable and accessible. 149 5.6 References Almeida, C., Travassos, C., Porto, S. and Labra, M.

Here I present the first comparison of RM in Brazil, China and India, to identify why they are investing in RM and what lessons may be learned about building high-tech capacity for emerging medical innovation. I use evidence from interviews with 150 key informants, domestic and international policies, government documents, scientometric data, and extensive grey and formal literature searches. I compare the main motivations behind RM development in these countries, and identify the common building blocks needed to build RM capacity. I then contrast some of approaches China, India and Brazil have used to build internationally competitive RM programs. 6.2 Introduction Regenerative medicine is a rapidly progressing field, both in developed countries and increasingly in the emerging economies. The worldwide market for RM is conservatively 1 Parts of this chapter, particularly the section on governance, may resemble in a general way results published in the following: McMahon, D., Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir, H. (2010). Lost in translation: China's struggle to develop appropriate stem cell regulations. SCRIPTed. 7(2): 274-285. Permission to use this material was granted by Shawn H.E. Harmon, Editor-in-Chief of the journal SCRIPTed. 155 estimated to be about US$500 billion, according to the United States Department of Health and Human Services (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2005). Publications on RM have surged globally, as has the number of RM journals. There are currently 34 stem cell related journals and of 16 journals specifically on stem cells, only three were in circulation in 2004 (Sanberg and Borlongan 2010). Several countries have stepped out as clear leaders in the publication of stem cell articles, including UK, US, Germany and Japan (McMahon, Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir et al. 2010). What may come as a surprise to some is that China, too, has emerged as a leader in this field; China is now the fifth largest publisher on stem cells in international peer-reviewed journals in the world, and has also approved the world's two first gene therapies (Guo and Xin 2006; McMahon, Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir et al. 2010). While RM fields in India and Brazil are comparatively small, they have both increased their publications on stem cells in peer-reviewed journals by over 14 fold in the last decade and made important contributions to the field (Lander, Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir et al. 2008; McMahon, Singer et al. 2010). Brazil is conducting what was the largest multi-centre randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial for stem cells in the world when it began, to explore the treatment of heart disease with stem cells (Tura, Martino et al. 2007). Brazil has also developed the world's first treatment that allows type 1 diabetes mellitus patients to achieve long-term insulin independence without constant immuno-suppression (Voltarelli, Couri et al. 2007; Couri, Oliveira et al. 2009). India has isolated five human embryonic stem cell lines (Cohen and Cohen 2010), two of which have been deposited in the United Kingdom stem cell bank (UK Stem Cell Bank 2010). India has also begun clinical trials for critical limb ischemia and myocardial infarction, and has treated over 700 patients with ocular burns with new corneas grown from limbal cells (Jayaraman 2009; C-TRACER 2010). Despite these advances, few peer-reviewed 156 articles discussed the rapid progression of RM in these countries and even fewer are based on empirically data. The previous case studies have outlined the successes and challenges of pursuing RM in Brazil, China and India (see Chapter 4 & 5, and Lander, Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir et al. 2008). They demonstrate that these countries have build RM capacity quickly, despite having fewer resources relative to other RM active countries around the world. Here, I compare why the emerging economies are motivated to invest in RM and how these countries have developed the capacity to rise so quickly in RM. While some of these elements may be presented in the individual case studies, this article provides the first comparative analysis based on empirical data of RM developments across Brazil, China and India. I distil for the reader the main motivations driving RM development in these countries, and the elements needed to build a competitive RM field. Each country has excelled in some elements, and each has struggled with others; I focus on some of the similarities and differences between the approaches used by each country in order to highlight learning opportunities. These strategies and approaches may hold important lessons for these countries and others interested in building RM capacity, or other high-tech biomedical fields. 6.3 Methods This analysis is based on data collected from three RM country case studies: Brazil, China and India. Please see Chapter 3 for details on methods used for this project. 157 6.4 Results & discussion 6.4.1 Why emerging economies invest in RM Emerging economies have numerous priorities vying for limited resources, such as clean water, access to essential medicines, education and basic infrastructure. Despite having many priorities and significantly less resources to invest compared to more affluent countries, Brazil, China and India have made substantial investments in RM. Here I explore several motivations behind the drive for RM. 6.4.1.1 Developing solutions for local health needs The case studies of all three countries indicate that Brazil, China and India are driven by local burdens of chronic disease and injury to pursue and prioritized RM developments in their countries. Many of the interviewees from across all three countries believe that it is important to develop RM capacity in order to develop much needed solutions to these currently incurable ailments, particularly chronic disease. Chronic disease deaths in the developing world account for an estimated 28 million lives per year, globally (Strong, Mathers et al. 2005). These rates are expected to increase further, as economic growth and changes to lifestyle and diet alter the health profiles of the countries (Ezzati, Hoorn et al. 2005). For example, the implementation of the one child policy in China in 1979 is altering population structure in China, resulting in a \"4-to-1 problem\". Children of this policy will be expected to support four grandparents in adulthood and the elderly are expected to account for 24% of the domestic population (Kaneda 2006). In Brazil, infectious diseases represented 46% of all deaths in 1930, but now only represent 5% of deaths, and cardiovascular 158 disease alone now represents 32% of mortalities (Minist\u00e9rio da Sa\u00fade 2008; Polanczyk and Ribeiro 2009). Chronic disease represents 53% of mortality in India, and rates are expected to escalate sharply over the next twenty years. India has the largest number of diabetics in the world, with 19.3 million individuals affected in 1995 (Srinath Reddy, Shah et al. 2005). Rates of injury are also high in the emerging economies, including spinal cord injury, head trauma and burns, among others. Many of the key informants stressed the importance of potential health implications from RM research and development for their domestic population. Researchers interviewed in all three countries are interested in developing treatments for local patients first and foremost, but would be interested in later marketing these locally established innovations internationally. While it is clear that health motivates RM developments in all three countries, it is important to note that it is not yet established that RM will serve as a panacea for chronic disease. While there is a lot of potential for RM to make important positive impact on health in these countries, RM is a high-risk field requiring long-term investments, and these countries already have significant difficulties providing affordable accessible health treatments such as vaccinations and basic medications for patients in need. I discuss equitable access to RM further in Chapter 8. 6.4.1.2 Fear of being left behind The case studies show that these countries have been able to make globally important contributions to the field because of their early involvement in the field. Many interviewees from all three countries felt it was important for their country to become involved in emerging biomedical fields, or they risk being left behind. This message was particularly strong in Brazil. Some interviewees felt their country had missed engaging in the pharmaceutical and software 159 fields early enough, and consequently that these sectors were domestically more based on reverse engineering then new to the world innovation. By engaging in RM early on, RM products and services can be developed locally, which make them more affordable, available for their population sooner, and would ensure domestic patients better access than if they were developed abroad. In the words of one interviewee: \"Israel, they went to the software. I would say the bus, they got the software and hardware technology bus. [...] I would say we missed the first bus... And I said, we must get this opportunity, because Brazil has a big social debt. We have to catch up. We cannot take 100 years, like other countries. We have to make in 10. We missed the first bus. And then now in 1998 I came to [my colleague] and said, I'm seeing again the bus is coming, let's not miss it again.\" [Interview BR41] Engaging in RM early on may also facilitate the uptake of future therapies within the domestic population. Hospital boards and doctors would be more familiar and comfortable with RM treatments if they had engaged in their research and clinical trials. In the words of two interviewees: \"So my concern was, my first concern was I had to train the medical student to be able to use the gene therapy product and the gene therapy procedures. [...] I think it is basically idealism, you know? When we are researching in gene therapy in the United States, it's just one more, but in Brazil there's going to be a big difference. So, I thought I can become seed in this area in this country. Obviously my number of publications will be lower and I will find many barriers to start research in this area and make a team. But I thought I can become seed and this is going to be important because this is applied.\" [ Interview BR16] 160 \"I think maybe it's because they see it [regenerative medicine] as a potential not to be left behind. Or they see it as a field where, because it's new, if they get in now they'll have IP in this area and its important health impact.\" [Interview BR12] Researchers from each country felt this was a field where they could make important global contributions. Some felt that participating early on may allow the country to develop a greater share of the field's intellectual property, and so potentially decrease the time and cost of future products and services. Several interviewees in each country indicated that RM was a strategic field to become involved in due to the reluctance of some countries, particularly the United States, to pursue hESC research. Interviewees from all three countries felt that these political struggles gave them a real chance to make a difference in the field. 6.4.1.3 Government responsibility for public health Governments take on different levels of responsibility for the health of their populations. Attitudes towards government's responsibilities for developing and providing healthcare differed significantly between the three countries of interest, making responsibility for public health more of a driver for RM development in some countries compared to others. In Brazil, several of my interviewees stressed that health is a national responsibility. In 1998, the Ministry of Health created the decentralized universal access healthcare system called Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade (SUS), known in English as the Unified Health System. The government also became responsible for investing in scientific and technological development. In 2004, the \"National Policy for Science Technology and Innovation in Health\" was approved to structure the national health research efforts, and the \"National Agenda of Priorities in Heath Research\", composed of 24 sub-agenda priorities, was set. In order to implement this agenda, a call for 161 proposals was launched in 2005, and stem cell therapy was one of eleven priority areas named (Guimar\u00e3es 2006; Rabello 2006). Part of the Secretariat of Science, Technology and Strategic Input's (SSTIE) agenda has been to \"overcome the technological vulnerability\" created by a high dependence on foreign countries for health products and finds essential the \"strengthening of the national system of innovation\" in order to overcome technological dependency on other countries (Ministry of Science and Technology and Ministry of Health 2003). The SSTIE is the main funder of the MiHeart trial of stem cells for cardiomyopathy, which received RS$13 million (US$7.85 million) in funding (Ministry of Health of Brazil 2008). In China, the government has mandated urban state enterprises to provide an insurance plan for all employees. A few interviewees mentioned that the success of RM might be determined by the extent of coverage for RM therapies offered by insurance companies. However, the strong conviction that the government was responsible for developing RM that I heard in the Brazilian interviews was mostly absent from the Chinese and Indian interviews, suggesting they feel it is not as strong of a driving factor for the development of RM in China and India. 6.4.2 How emerging economies developed RM I identify above why the governments of Brazil, China and India want to be involved in RM research and development, but countries need more than the will to do it, they also need the capacity to carry it out. My analysis indicates that the following elements have been instrumental to developing RM in the emerging economies: 1) strong linkages between stake-holders 2) sustained governmental support, 3) skilled human resources 4) strong infrastructure, and 5) good governance. I introduce these elements below and compare the approaches used by Brazil, China and India. 162 6.4.2.1 Strong stake-holder linkages My analysis shows that RM development requires strong relationships between different types of organizations involved in RM. In China, many of the universities that conduct RM research had tight affiliations to hospitals. These relationships help researchers gain access to cells, tissues and patients. In the words of one stem cell researcher: \"Now everyone would say that they have a close collaborator in the hospital, and I'm talking about the scientists. And most of the hospitals, they would have collaborations with the sort of top notch scientists.\" [Interview CH6] While clinician research collaborations were frequent in China, the level of their interactions could be deeper and more frequent. Often it seemed collaborators across all three countries shared grants, but did not always speak often with one another, leaving little opportunity for cross-learning. Brazil, China and India could increase the number and quality of national and international collaborations in order to improve the transfer of knowledge and the learning process between researchers. Researchers and clinicians need to create active collaborations: \"What is required is that there should be some real basic research and the clinical groups should join hands. And both should listen to each other...The collaboration should be clear cut and on very specified problems.\" [Interview IN6] Although some formal collaboration occurs, key informants indicated these collaborations sometimes lack depth and do not fully engage both collaborators to share information and solve common problems. 163 As end users of RM, patients may determine what outcome is needed from a therapy for it to be beneficial. Researchers that are aware of patients' needs can better come up with solutions that are appropriate. This is exemplified in the following quote: \"What we don't really know is what the patients want. And the clinicians will know exactly. If you can achieve this level of glucose stability for this period of time, for this amount of money, then it's a very good [diabetic] therapy. Otherwise, it's not. Because we are basic research scientists, [we] never understanding these things.\" [Interview CH6] In Brazil, RM translation is limited by weak linkages between researchers and firms, and between researchers and hospitals. My analysis shows few hospitals are used to conducting research and so have little collaboration with universities. The Brazilian government has tried to increase private-sector and university collaborations with the Innovation Law, but Brazilian interviewees also felt existing biotech firms in general have few collaborations with universities and hire few PhDs. Interviewees in India, too, felt that RM could benefit from stronger connections between basic researchers and clinicians. While public-private research collaborations have been historically weak, India's Department of Biotechnology has tried to strengthen these by allocating funding towards public-private partnerships, particularly in \"advanced\" or \"futuristic\" technologies (Department of Biotechnology 2010). Stem cell and tissue engineering technologies are specifically outlined in this strategy as areas where additional joint public-private funding could increase India's global competitiveness. 164 6.4.2.2 Sustained governmental support It is clear from the individual case studies that government support for RM has been instrumental to its development in Brazil, China and India. The government policies and financing have been described in each of the individual case studies (Lander, Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir et al. 2008; McMahon, Singer et al. 2010; McMahon, Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir et al. 2010). The comparative analysis shows that government involvement can drive RM, in particular when their involvement has been both targeted and responsive, and when financial strategies are consistent over time, but stratified for different types of activities. Funding programs with earmarked or targeted funding for RM have been invaluable in building RM capacity, and clear strategies can help RM move towards specific goals quickly. For example, China has prioritized research with clear disease applications, and following the approval of the Bio-security Law in 2005, Brazil has emphasized the development of new stem cell lines. Changes to funding and regulation that are responsive to the sector's needs have helped the field progress smoothly. For example, following a survey conducted in 2008, the Brazilian government identified that access to clinical quality cells would be a major barrier if stem cell therapies are successfully developed. Brazil dedicated US$12 million in late 2008 to the development of a new national network of stem cell institutes (Squizato 2008). These centres will develop the clinical protocols needed to generate cells that could be used for clinical treatment. In all three countries, the most successful RM researchers felt that funding for research was sufficient and did not present an important barrier to their work. Some researchers, especially those in Brazil, were concerned that short-term grants and inconsistent funding lead to short-term 165 goals. In all three countries, moving past the laboratory was difficult because of a lack of funding for clinical trials, and difficulty accessing capital for new RM firms. Several interviewees in each country suggested that one or more important political figures were important to prioritization of RM, showing the importance of individual leadership at the political level to champion RM development. Interviewees in each country also stressed that red tape and bureaucracy could slow research and hamper innovation, demonstrating that across all three countries, there is still room for improvement at the political level to facilitate research and regulation of medical products and services. 6.4.2.3 Skilled human resources This research shows that a critical mass of skilled human resources is essential for RM development in the emerging economies. Investment in better quality labs, equipment and other resources cannot be fully used if these countries are not able to retain the talent to run them. Emerging economies suffer from high rates of brain drain in science and technological fields, and RM is no exception. Many of the top graduate student trainees in RM will leave the country to pursue post-doctoral research, additional studies, or employment in North America and Europe. While the problem is the same across these countries, the solutions have varied; each country case has employed unique strategies to build up a skilled labour force needed for innovative RM work, as discussed below. India has developed specialized training opportunities in RM, and interviewees expressed the need for more such opportunities. One researcher stated: \"We have the expertise. Some of them need a bit of training. In fact, our government right now is very encouraging of providing that environment. Different agencies are 166 coming up with more funding for such fellowships, etc. So the training part is there\" [Interview IN17] Building critical mass in the emerging economies depends not only on educating and training individuals, but also on recruiting and retaining qualified individuals within these countries. In the words of one Chinese interviewee, \"If we have a Buddha, then we build a temple. We will never build a temple before the Buddha comes\" [Interview CH5]. China in particular has created a successful program to recruit skilled researchers for science intensive fields. The Chinese government has developed a skilled RM labour force by using financial and research incentives to recruit back to China experts of Chinese origin that have worked or trained abroad at leading RM institutions from around the world, and these returnees make up the backbone of research being done in Chinese institutions of excellence. My research shows that far fewer returnees dominate the RM fields of Brazil and India, as compared to that of China. There was no specific program to recruit nationals back to India or Brazil, but many RM researchers in Brazil had spent at least some time working abroad as a visiting researcher, or for part of their education. Brazil has also developed a scholarship that allows students to spend part of their time training in a developed country, but requires that the student \"sandwich\" this time between research in Brazil, ensuring the transfer of skills to home labs and ensuring the students return to Brazil to finish their program. Interviewees felt this program exposes students to the scientific culture of the West, allows for networking and collaborative activities, and provides access to specialized training. Brazilian interviewees in general expressed that they felt their students were well trained and well received in other countries. 167 This research shows that individuals return to their countries of origin because of different reasons: some believe they can have a larger impact on RM in their home country than in the West, and are motivated to drive the science of their country forward. Others return to be closer to family, to a lifestyle, or to their culture. While their choices to return are personal, most expressed that they felt that the environment - either political, scientific or financial - was now able to support them. Brazil, China and India can tackle the brain drain phenomena by tapping into these motivations - providing a positive science research environment, devising policies that encourage diaspora to stay or return in their home countries, and encouraging diaspora to make collaborative contributions to the research programs of their home country. 6.4.2.4 Strategies to build infrastructure One of the largest challenges to science developments in developing countries is developing adequate research facilities - a challenge that China, India and Brazil have made strides to overcome. In addition to research funds, all three countries have made similar investments to increase the infrastructure and laboratory facilities available for RM research by creating RM research networks. Brazil has invested US$12 million in the development of a new national network of stem cell institutes that will develop clinical grade stem cell protocols and lines. China is developing a network of national institutes to develop and bank stem cell lines (Xu 2008), and aim to be repositories of high-quality human stem cell lines for use within China and internationally. India has invested US$50 million to build the Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine which will further develop India's basic and clinical RM research (Sachitanand 2009). In 2005, India initiated a plan to develop stem cell city clusters in the major cities involved in RM research (Padma 2005; Salter, Cooper et al. 2007). These \"clusters\" would 168 encourage collaboration and encourage involved institutes to share facilities, ideas, research, and business opportunities. Despite the above investments, challenges to building RM infrastructure remain. In all three countries, significant differences in infrastructure were visible between individual organizations and between cities or regions, a problem further discussed in Chapter 8. Some researchers in Brazil complained that while funding was available for reagents and research protocols, more funding was needed to update the buildings and lab space that housed some RM research programs. Specialized equipment too, may be only available in the largest universities of the largest cities. 6.4.2.5 Characteristics of good governance Regulations are essential in medicine to both establish the norms and practices within the research community, and to protect patients and research participants from undo harm. Regulators have to position themselves to balance between obstructing innovation with overbearing polices and ensuring human and environmental safety. Both too much and insufficient regulation cause tension between different R&D stake-holders and limit overall innovative capacity. Of the three countries studied, Brazil's hESC policies are the most restrictive, as they do not allow the creation of embryos for research purposes or therapeutic cloning. Therapeutic cloning is also banned in France, Canada and Australia (Wheat and Matthews 2007). The hESC regulations of China and India are more liberal than those of Brazil, more closely resembling 169 those of the UK, as they allow therapeutic cloning and the creation of cybrids2. A summary of the characteristics of the national regulations is available in Table 6.1, based on my analysis of each country's regulations. Table 6.1: Comparison of human embryonic stem cell policies in Brazil, China, India and United Kingdom (UK). Note that a mark in brackets indicates that while there is evidence to indicate the activity is allowed/prohibited, it is not explicitly condoned/condemned in the regulations. Condoned activities may be limited by additional restrictions and/or require individual formal permission or licenses. Policies for embryonic stem cell use Brazil China India UK Human cloning Use of existing hESC lines () () () Use of unused human IFV embryos Human IVF embryos can only be used with parental informed consent Creation of human embryo for research purpose () Human therapeutic cloning (SCNT) () Creation of for hESC work SCNT= somatic cell nuclear transfer Many of the researchers and firms I interviewed in China and India identified regulatory issues as one of the largest challenges to their work. Researchers in Brazil were largely content with the regulatory framework for both basic and clinical research. However, it is important to note that 2 Cybrids are defined here as created by inserting the nucleus of a human somatic cell into an emptied animal ovum, such as a rabbit ovum. 3 Ibid. 170 my interviews occurred in Brazil shortly after hESC research was approved following a three-year legal battle in the Supreme Court; if the interviews had been conducted while the regulations were still contested, I may have found that researchers were less pleased with the regulatory climate. India and China were developing or implementing new regulatory frameworks for clinical stem cell use during the interviews; as China and India have not finished implementing these regulations since these interviews4, I expect that the regulatory situation is still an important issue to the interviewees. My analysis identified common elements from Brazil, China and India's experiences that may promote good governance and encourage innovation. I find that regulations must be culturally appropriate, relevant to multiple stake-holders, timely, enforceable, and cover all aspects of development. These aspects are discussed below using examples from each country's unique approaches to stem cell governance. There are significant differences in the approaches taken by each country, in part due to religious and cultural values, and in part due to different attitudes at a political level towards medical innovation and regulation. Culturally relevant. This comparative analysis identified the importance of developing regulations in context of their cultural surroundings. Regulations need to be sufficiently flexible to allow researchers the ability to learn and innovate, but must adhere to the country's cultural values. These values may differ extensively between countries, particularly with respect to the acceptance of embryonic stem cell research. In China, an embryo is not typically perceived as having \"person-hood\", and so there has been little cultural or religious opposition to embryonic stem cell research. While permissive, 4 Accurate up to the date this was written (January 2011). 171 embryonic stem cell guidelines are well aligned to the culture for which they were constructed. Chinese researchers are allowed to conduct research restricted in other countries and some believe the permissive nature of these regulations allow them greater freedom to innovate, conferring them a competitive advantage in this field. One interviewee in China commented that while culture is an important consideration, it is not the sole consideration and should never be used to justify research that would violate deeper ethical issues or the scientific process. For example, the guidelines require that embryonic material be obtained with full parental informed consent, and that embryos not be used past 14 days of development. Some domestic and international researchers question, however, whether China's clinical regulations, which allow the commercialization of unproven therapies, adhere to ethical norms and the scientific process. Culture has also played an essential role in the development of Brazilian ESC regulations. Brazil's stem cell funding was largely on hold while the legality of embryonic stem cell research was challenged in Brazil's highest courts by representatives of the Catholic Church. The new laws allow hESC research, reflecting the feelings of the Brazilian population; 75% of Brazilians fully support hESC research despite their largely Catholic heritage and upbringing. Appropriate for all stake-holders. This analysis shows regulations work best when they are appropriate for multiple stake-holder groups. Brazil used a broad stake-holder consultation strategy to design effective regulations for hESC research. While reviewing the Bio-security Law, the Brazilian Supreme Court launched the first-ever public debate in its 178-year history to explore the issue, involving consultation with patients and patient groups, religious leaders, researchers, clinicians, and members of the public. China and India have both struggled to design clinical stem cell regulations that appeal to a wider stake-holder group. Evidence from the interviews indicates that some researchers and ethicists 172 were involved in small expert group consultations by the government, but their opinions are not necessarily reflected in the final regulations. In China prior to 2009, firms and hospitals engaging in \"stem cell tourism\" (see Box 6.1) supported clinical regulations that allowed stem cells to be used for new indications without additional clinical trials. Some Chinese ethicists and most of the researchers I interviewed criticize these same regulations, which they believe may put patients at harm, and which obscured the clinical trial path for new innovative therapies. This is similar to the situation in India, where clinical regulations also allow stem cell tourism despite the concerns of many Indian researchers that these practices are unethical, unscientific, and expose patients to undue risk. For example, while speaking of these unproven therapies, Vasantha Muthuswami, head of Basic Medical Sciences at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in New Delhi said, \"we want to promote stem cell technology, but not in this scandalous way\" (Jayaraman 2005a). Box 6.1: Stem cell tourism in China and India. One of the most striking differences between China, India and Brazil's stem cell sectors is the development of a stem cell tourism industry in China and India. Stem cell tourism is a practice by which stem cell treatments are made available to paying patients from around the world for indications for which there is little or no clinical evidence of their safety or efficacy. These treatments are available for a wide number of indications including Lou Gehrig's disease, traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, autism, cerebral palsy, stroke, optic nerve hypoplasia and many others. Clinics engaging in stem cell tourism often provide unsubstantiated claims of benefits with few or no discussion of potential negative side effects or risks (Lau, Ogbogu et al. 2008). The International Society of Stem Cell Research (ISSCR), BIONET and the United States FDA have condemned stem cell tourism (Cressey 2009; ISSCR 2009; Cyranoski 2010). Many stem cell researchers in India and China are highly critical of any stem cell therapies being offered prior to clinical evidence of their safety and efficacy. 173 Unproven stem cell treatments are offered in countries with either weak or absent regulations for the clinical use of stem cells, including China, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, India, Mexico and Turkey, among others (Ryan, Sanders et al. 2010). China is one of the top destinations for international patients seeking these therapies, with an estimated 200 clinics and hospitals offering these therapies. To my knowledge, no such clinics are operating in Brazil. Timely. This analysis indicates that regulations need to be responsive and timely or they risk hindering the innovation process. Many stem cell researchers from China and India expressed concern that the delays in developing and implementing governance frameworks imposed a significant challenge for researchers and companies interested in moving their research forward. Researchers and companies are unwilling to invest time and money developing treatments when it seems likely that regulations could soon change. In addition, several interviewees believed strong governance frameworks would increase the international credibility of their work. China has experienced significant delays implementing clinical regulations for stem cells. When first announced in May 2009, the government promised implementation of these clinical regulations within six months (Qiu 2009). Over a year and a half later, these regulations have still not been finalized or implemented, much to the disappointment of some of my sources in the research community. India too has experienced significant delays implementing clinical and hESC regulation in India. Research and regulatory interviewees indicated in 2006 that guidelines on stem cell research would be finalized and legalized within months. Over four years later, these steps have not yet been completed. 174 Several interviewees in Brazil felt the Supreme Court case over the legality of hESC research somewhat delayed stem cell research there as well. During the debate, stem cell research was legal, but political support for stem cell research diminished. Several interviewees felt that once the debates were over, the Ministry of Health was quick to create supportive funding specifically for stem cell research. Enforceable. All three countries have developed regulations or guidelines delineating the limits of hESC research in the country, but interviewees in China and India questioned how enforceable their regulations are. Clear mechanisms for regulatory enforcement and clear countermeasures against offenses may not only decreased chances of offence, but also increased internal and external confidence in the governance system. In China, the Embryonic Stem Cell Research Guidelines carry no legal weight. Internal funding mechanism have inhibited any obvious violation of these regulations; all researchers receiving federal funding must comply with the guidelines or lose their grants. While there were no indications that the rules were being violated, there are no enforcement or oversight mechanisms for privately funded organizations. India's ESC and clinical guidelines too are not legally enforceable; while several years go, many interviewees indicated an expectation that they would become law shortly, this has not yet occurred. Unlike China and India, Brazil's embryonic stem cell research regulations are set out in law. Govern all stages of development. Adequate regulations are needed for every stage of every type of stem cell research and development. While this may seem obvious, debate over the activities of stem cell clinics seems at times incorrectly focused on embryonic stem cell regulations, not the clinical regulations. For example, in China interviewees sometimes felt that enforcement of research regulations was insufficient, incorrectly citing the clinical use of these cells by some 175 hospitals. The stem cell clinics mostly use adult autologous stem cells, or allogenic cord-blood or foetal cells, for which the research guidelines for embryonic stem cells do not apply; the clinical uses of these types of stem cells require separate regulation. This confusion is also present in the literature. In a letter to the journal Nature, Chinese researchers stated that \"China already has clear stem cell guidelines\", citing the embryonic research guidelines and the reproductive technology regulations as examples (Cheng, Qiu et al. 2006). The letter went on to describe that a few medical practitioners were using cells to treat patients \"without government approvals or appropriate clinical trials\" and stated that they believe this is a matter of law enforcement, but did not discuss what law or regulation, if any, applied to the clinical use of such cells. Although the material presented in this letter is not technically incorrect, a greater distinction between research regulation and clinical regulation would be highly beneficial to discussion about stem cell regulations in China. My informal discussions with researchers outside of China and interactions at conferences suggest that the international community also fails to sufficiently distinguish between liberal or absent stem cell clinical regulations and permissive hESC research regulation. India's strategy was to design stem cell guidelines to cover multiple stages of product development, including research and clinical developments. While not all stake-holders agree with the liberties these regulations afford, the guidelines do cover clinical use of stem cells, and set standards for different types of stem cells. Brazil has developed completely separate regulations for different stages of therapeutic development, and Brazilian interviewees were generally aware of the separately regulated paths for research and clinical stem cell use. The legal status of stem cell policies in Brazil, China and India are summarized in Table 6.2. 176 Table 6.2: Comparison of the stages covered and legal status of stem cell policies in Brazil, China, India and United Kingdom (UK). Brazil China India UK State of embryonic stem cell policies: Binding/Enforceable Legislation pending Guidelines available State of clinical stem cell policies Binding/Enforceable * Legislation pending * Guidelines available *While proof of safety and efficacy are now legally required to commercially provide stem cell therapies, further details outlining specific requirements for the clinical use of stem cells as well as enforcement of these regulations are still pending. 6.5 Conclusions: This comparative analysis of China, India and Brazil indicates that while there have been a variety of strategies and approaches to RM development, some common elements exist. First, countries have similar motivations to invest in RM, including local health needs, a desire not to be left out of new technological developments, and a responsibility to improve health within their countries. Given this desire to invest in RM, I next asked how these emerging economies have developed RM programs. I show RM development in the emerging economies can be facilitated through strategic government support, particularly if policies are targeted and responsive, and if funding is consistent and stratified across basic, applied and clinical RM research. RM needs key inputs: infrastructure, funds, and skilled human resources. These need to 177 be mediated by strong linkages between these skilled individuals, and by a strong regulatory framework. There is much to learn from both the successes and challenges faced by India, China and Brazil. In Table 6.3, I highlight some of strategies of the three countries of study, in hopes to identify learning opportunities that could be of interest for these and other countries interested in building-up RM capacity, or other emerging biomedical technologies. Table 6.3: Strategies for building regenerative medicine innovation from the emerging economies Political Support Provide sustained political support Ensure long-term funding is available for well-defined long-term goals Identify individual champions to help drive RM political support Design policy and funding to be responsive to research needs Limit red-tape and bureaucracy Provide financial or organizational support for clinical trials Earmark or target funding for RM to develop specific research goals Human resources Recruit skilled diaspora back using financial and research incentives Provide training/education opportunities abroad \"sandwiched\" between in-country learning Provide specialized in-country training programs for specialized fields Facilitate the uptake of skilled researchers into firms Ensure knowledge flows between researchers, entrepreneurs, and clinicians Infrastructure Build networked centres of excellence focused on RM Ensure access to cells and tissues through national stem cell banks Invest in the creation, maintenance and distribution of clinical grade stem cell lines Develop sufficient infrastructure for all funded RM researchers Governance Permissive research regulations can be advantageous, but only if supported by cultural and ethical values. Regulations should be acceptable to multiple stake-holder types Regulations for clinical use of stem cells should be explicit Regulations should cover every stage of product innovation and development Regulations need to be fully implemented in a timely fashion Regulations need to be enforceable Insufficient regulation can lead to bottlenecks in product development and diminish domestic and international confidence. The development of RM has depended largely on the religious, cultural, political and economic environments of each country, and each country needs to take into account its unique strengths 178 and challenges. Although the elements for RM are fragmented into categories here, each country's strategies are of course interdependent and intertwined. For example, infrastructure and human resources are important elements necessary to support RM research programs, but without linkages between different RM stake-holders, knowledge and expertise may remain isolated and new technologies may stagnate, never reaching their clinical potential. While explicit clinical regulations may be beneficial, without private funding resources such as venture capital to sustain the large costs of clinical trials, few products are likely to reach market in a timely fashion. It is important that no one element be viewed as discrete or independent, but instead as an important part of the systemic development of RM. The case studies of RM and the comparative analysis have examined the state of RM across China, India and Brazil, including the motivations driving RM investments, their strengths and challenges, and the conditions and strategies used to build RM. This chapter has illustrated some of the similarities and differences between these strategies to highlight learning opportunities from these three case studies. I have used a systemic perspective to examine RM, looking at the different types of organizations that are involved in RM, the linkages between them, and the institutions that influence their actions. Few studies have examined emerging technologies using a systemic perspective such as this, and it is hoped that this research may have important implications for the innovation system literature. While a more innovation system based discussion does not fit with the scope of this Chapter, I make greater linkages with the innovation systems literature in the following chapter (Chapter 7). This chapter shows that RM is driven in each of the three countries by a motivation to develop much needed RM treatments locally, in order to provide health solutions to untreatable conditions that are accessible and affordable. However, intentions are not always indicative of 179 outcomes. There was no consensus between interviewees from any country of study on whether they expected RM therapies to be accessible or affordable. Further discussion on how accessible RM therapies may become will be focus of Chapter 8. 6.6 References C-TRACER (2010).

Here, I rely on my case studies and case study comparison of RM in Brazil, China, and India to help understand RM innovation from a systemic perspective. In this chapter, I discuss this system and the process of RM innovation. I introduce the roles of the main types of actor in RM innovation and look at the interactions between users and producers. I also discuss the advantages and challenges of innovating in RM faced by the emerging economies compared to those typically faced by latecomer developing countries. Innovation in developing countries is usually described as a process of reverse engineering, but this description may not be well suited to describing innovation in an emerging field such as RM. I also find that RM innovation is demand-driven and occurs under conditions unique to countries with lower-resources. Lastly, firms play a decentralized role in RM innovation at this stage of its development, showing the importance of initially using a wide research perspective. 7.2 Introduction Sectoral systems of innovation (SSI) can be generally defined as a network of actors and linkages between organizations and institutions involved in the creation, diffusion and use of 185 knowledge within a particular technology or sector. The sectoral system based approach to studying innovation is intended to be a broad and adaptable tool that allows qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis across countries and regions (Malerba 2009). Most sectoral innovation studies have been conducted in developed countries, but as I show in Chapter 2, sectoral innovation focused on developing countries is now on the rise. Only a few studies using sectoral innovation frameworks have examined new biomedical fields in developing countries (see for example Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir, Quach et al. 2004; Niosi and Reid 2007), and none have examined RM. I build on the comparison and case studies already presented in order to discuss the key characteristics of RM innovation in the emerging economies, including who makes up the system, and how these players come together to innovate in RM. This discussion has implications for how innovation in the emerging economies is perceived, particularly with respect to high-tech or emerging technologies. 7.3 Methods This analysis is based on the results and comparison of RM case studies of Brazil, China and India. Please see Chapter 3 for a description of the methodology used. 7.4 Results & discussion 7.4.1 Major actors Innovation systems are composed of major organizations, institutions and the links between them (Lundvall, Vang et al. 2009). I have already identified many of the important research and 186 government organizations by name in the individual case studies. In this section, I reflect more broadly on the role of each type of innovation actor within the RM innovations system. Firms. Innovation system literature typically places the role of firms as central to the innovative process, as they integrate knowledge of different actors to formulate products and services. With respect to RM, I find the central role of firms somewhat muted for three main reasons. Firstly, RM is still a young field with few products and services worldwide, and the long-term high-risk investments needed for RM have made investors hesitant. This is even more pronounced in the emerging economies, where angel and venture capital investors are sparse. Secondly, most of the innovation in RM is being developed in academic institutions and research centres, in part due to the immaturity of the field and in part due to heavy investment from government for research. Thirdly, while the firm's role in developing products and services in health innovation is undisputed, hospitals also play an important role in the clinical testing and distribution of some health products and services, further decentralizing the innovation process from firms. The commercial path of stem cells is so far unclear; depending on the degree of manipulation and culturing, stem cells and tissue engineering could be considered as a drug or as a service, but it seems likely now that hospitals will have an important role to play in both the testing and delivery of treatments. In China, India and Brazil, the regulatory agencies in charge of drugs have indicated little interest in overseeing the development of stem cell therapies; instead, stem cells are treated more as a medical procedure. One Chinese researcher I interviewed stated: \"I think the country is still debating on stem cells as a new drug or a new treatment. So that's, that's still open debate.\" [Interview CH6] He believed that firms saw RM as more of a treatment, making them hesitant to invest: 187 \"They [pharmaceutical companies] still think stem cells are un-sellable - so in other words it can never become a small cure that you can take everyday, right? So they are basically not interested.\" [Interview CH6] This is not to say there are no roles for firms in RM in China, India and Brazil, only that other actors have an increased role to play in this immature health-based industry. I also expect firm activity will increase as more RM products are developed, as more evidence of safety and efficacy is accumulated, and as more products near commercialization. Government. The case studies clearly show governments have been instrumental to providing financial, policy and regulatory support to RM innovation. Researchers in all three countries indicated that levels of funding were adequate, and that government policies were supportive. Permissive research regulations in India and China seem to have helped spur RM innovation and government interest in promoting research with clinical applications has also seemed to help these countries advance in RM quickly. According to Kim, a key limitation for developing countries to engage in innovative research and developments is their ability to build sufficient technical learning through knowledge accumulation and intensity of effort (Kim 1998). Government commitments to RM have been essential to overcoming these challenges. RM has been successful largely because of targeted commitments from government and unique inputs of knowledge and effort into RM sector through government strategies to train, recruit and retain qualified personnel, as previously described in Chapter 6. Universities and public research centres. This research shows universities and other public research centres are essential to RM innovation in two ways: firstly, they are the main 188 educational and training establishments that produce the human resources needed for science intensive fields. Secondly, most of R&D for RM is currently carried out in public universities and research centres. The research and development I observed conducted in universities dwarfed that conducted by firms, and most firms are largely dependent on their ties with academia to supply the basic knowledge behind their research. Universities may also collaborate directly with hospitals to conduct the clinical trials necessary to make RM therapies a reality. Hospitals. Hospitals are both essential for the recruitment of patients and administration of therapy in clinical trials, and will be the likely distributor and gatekeeper of future RM therapies to end users, the patients. Top researchers will require tighter linkages with hospitals and clinicians for safe and efficacious translation of RM. A few interviewees indicated that doctors of smaller hospitals were not well aware of RM advances and would likely be uncomfortable recommending it to patients unless greater attention was made to supplement their education and training. Other types of organizations. Other types of organizations have direct and indirect influences on RM innovation. Cord blood banks and IVF clinics are uniquely positioned to collect and distribute human biological materials and tissues needed for stem cell research. IVF clinics supply hESCs for all three countries and in China, some stem cell researchers have forged close linkages with IVF clinics in order to ensure access to these cells. Cord blood banks also provide access to human stem cells for research, and may act as a major repository of stem cells if RM therapies become mainstream. In anticipation of the medical benefits RM may generate, many parents across Brazil, China and India have begun saving or donating cord blood in private and public cord blood banks. In India, cord blood banks are not only developing cell collections but are also engaging in research that would develop RM treatments and clinical stem cell protocols. 189 At least a few cord blood and stem cell banks across all three countries are positioning themselves to be the middleman between the patient and the hospital, acting as a source of both cells and technical expertise on their extraction, purification, and storage. In addition to cells, RM researchers need access to a variety of specialized supplies in order to conduct their work. Animal testing facilities and specialized supply companies also support RM research and preclinical testing. Other groups, such as ethicists and media centres, have also had an important influence on regulation development and knowledge flow. Ethicists, for example, took a lead in developing regulations and guidelines for stem cell research in China. In Brazil, the domestic media has been essential to the distribution of information about the risks and potential benefits of RM. In all three countries, the coverage of stem cells in the media is accessible largely by the higher and middle-ranged socio-economic demographic and the general population outside major cities or with very little education have limited or no knowledge of stem cells, which may impact the uptake of RM technologies by these individuals in the future. 7.4.2 The role of institutions Institutions comprise both the formal regulations and policies and the informal social norms and behaviors that influence how innovation actors interact. Formal institutions have had an important influence on the development of RM; each country has taken different approaches to designing regulations governing embryonic stem cell research and clinical use of stem cells, as is described in more depth in Chapter 6. All three countries have debated at least some of these regulations during their development or implementation, and those of China and India are still under development. 190 Interviewees found informal institutions too, were important to the development of RM in each country. Several interviewees told me that traditionally China did not have a strong scientific research culture, but that RM was helping develop skilled students and researchers that could make internationally significant contributions to scientific research. One interviewee stated: \"In our tradition we did not encourage innovation enough. The Chinese have never asked why the sky is not falling down ... Now they are just at the stage of learning or being trained. And that's not to train one generation, that's to train culture. That will take time.\" [Interview CH5] Interviewees in Brazil also found that research culture is important; one researcher in Brazil stated: \"I say that most of our greatest difficulty is the culture. It's not exactly money or technology or - it's the culture\" [Interview BR9]. Overseas training programs may be more important for the development of \"research culture\" than gaining any particular technical skills. Educational and academic programs that allow time abroad and recruitment of diaspora may then be important inputs of scientific culture in addition to their training components. High numbers of principal investigators with overseas training may also have positive externalities for the field as a whole, as these researchers become responsible for training a new generation of researchers. Informal institutions outside of the emerging economies can also influence RM developments. Interviewees sometimes felt that while a few top researchers may be recognized in their fields, in general the RM sectors of their country were under-estimated internationally, and that internationally, their research credibility was low. In Brazil, interviewees believed this was 191 largely because the outside world had little knowledge of Brazilian science and a bias against developing countries, leading to a mistrust of Brazilian products. In India and China, this low credibility and damaged reputation is caused at least in part by international discontent with the activities of the stem cell tourism industry, and by recent scandals in Asia about research integrity (Xin and Marshall 2006; ISSCR 2009; Cyranoski 2010; Padma 2010). 7.5 Describing the process of RM innovation The first section of this chapter gives a more refined idea of who is innovating. Here I would like to discuss more how this innovation is occurring. From my interviews, it became clear there is no single answer. It seems RM innovation does not adhere to one predominate strategy, such as reverse engineering, but is instead a mixed bag of tricks. The emerging economies are using all the techniques at their disposal, including new to the world innovation, process innovation, business innovation, and at times, importation of ideas from other countries. When asked if the RM sector of their country was primarily producing new-to-the-world innovation or if these innovations were only new to the country and had been previously made abroad, many respondents answered \"both\". One Brazilian interviewee explained: \"I think it is happening both ways. Because, firstly, most such research has economic interests. If you see some new good product, good procedure that can be adapted in Brazil, obviously this is easy way to start. But in parallel, as I mentioned, we have some very good basic research. [Brazilian researchers] like to innovate new things. And in this area we are doing okay, and so I can say we are doing both equally.\" [Interview BR16] Not all RM research and development in Brazil, China and India is innovative on a global scale and some RM ideas and strategies have been imported or imitated. Protocols published in 192 academic journals around the world can and have been replicated in the emerging economies, and are a good mechanism for catching up with the latest protocols or RM breakthroughs. However, it is important to note that this knowledge is not merely a North to South hand-me-down, but is, in fact, the way science moves forwards everywhere around the world. Emerging economies have made certain milestones that, while not new to the world, are new to the country and which open up opportunities for further innovation. For example, while iPS cell lines were not first created in Brazil, Brazil was able to create its own unique iPS cell lines, enabling Brazilian scientist to research and innovate with these types of cells. In China, the gene therapy produced by Shanghai Sunway Biotech Co. was inspired by an American drug called Onyx - 015 made by Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. but Sunway Biotech developed its drug independently, and patented their version in China (Guo and Xin 2006). By relying on clinical trial data from the United States that showed clinical efficacy of the drug, Sunway Biotech was able to focus its efforts on a lower risk gene therapy that could reach the market relatively quickly. Sunway Biotech became the first to fully develop, test and commercialize this product, and have subsequently obtained exclusive worldwide rights from Onyx Pharmaceuticals (Guo and Xin 2006) . At times the RM sector has relied on incremental and process innovation for RM. One interviewee in India stated: \"Innovating is all about not only doing different things but doing them differently\" [Interview IN10]. An Indian government representative indicated that he believed India had particular strengths in process innovation, in particular to make innovations affordable, accessible, acceptable and available. For example, the LV Prasad Institute in India claims to have treated over 700 patients for ocular burns using corneas grown from limbal stem cells, which they believe to be the largest successful application of stem cell therapy in the world 193 (C-TRACER 2010; Champalimaud Foundation 2011). While the researchers that developed this protocol did not invent this procedure, they claim the improvements they have made to the protocol allow for a much smaller sample of limal cell tissue to be initially removed, increasing the success and availability of the treatment. The institute is now testing the efficacy of a new protocol to use cells from the oral mucosa when limal cells are not available, and has begun preclinical testing of iPS cells for treatment of some forms of retinitis pigmentosa (C-TRACER 2010). More Indian interviewees discussed the importance of process innovation to RM, perhaps crediting process innovation for the success of the Indian generic pharmaceutical sector. Incremental and process innovation also came up frequently in Brazilian interviews, whereas Chinese interviewees focused their discussion on more new to the world innovation. The exclusion of incremental innovation discussions in China does not, however, imply that they are not using these tactics, as shown in the above gene therapy example. It may show instead how they see themselves in the field and how they perceive the innovative process. Business innovation has been important to the sustainability of new RM companies. Some of the interviewees are at the stage of starting clinical trials of their RM treatments. Funding for clinical trials and R&D can be hard to obtain, and some of these firms rely on the production of secondary less innovative products or services in order to stay afloat through the pre-market product development phase of their more innovative RM products and services. For example, Shanghai Qisheng Biological Preparations in China has several marketed products that help fund research on novel bio-scaffolding products. According to a company representative, Excellion Servi\u00e7os Biom\u00e9dicos in Brazil was founded to facilitate stem cell R&D, but generates income from other services, such as culturing skin cells, and manipulating bone-marrow cells, and conducting toxicity assays. Vector Gene Technology Company Ltd. in China is currently 194 marketing plasmid DNA and gene vectors to produce revenue while it engages in R&D for a number of gene therapy treatments. New to the world innovation is also an important part of RM innovation in the emerging economies, much of which is described in the individual case studies. Outputs of innovation are often measured in the form of patents and publications. Research published in international peer-reviewed journals is primarily globally innovative, and I have already shown that all three countries have drastically increased their publications over the past decade. China is one of the most prolific publishers of stem cell research in peer-reviewed journals in the world. Quite a few of the interviewees I spoke claimed to hold patents or to have submitted patent applications on their RM research in their countries and abroad, further demonstrating their work is innovative. RM researchers I spoke with felt they are driven to make internationally significant innovations, and are proud of their accomplishments in the field: \"We don't want to just copy other research; we want to do something innovative. The leaders are first class researchers, they impact the field...we want to be first class, to have an impact.\" [Interview CH17] For example, Brazil has developed the world's first treatment that allows type 1 diabetic patients to achieve long-term insulin independence without constant immuno-suppression, and is the only treatment that impedes the progression of type 1 diabetes in humans. China produced the world's first mouse cloned from iPS cells, which two labs published separately on the same day, showing that Chinese stem cell researchers are both internationally and domestically competitive (Kang, Wang et al. 2009; Zhao, Li et al. 2009). This innovative cloning technique was listed as one of the \"Top 10 Medical Breakthroughs for 2009\" in Time magazine. 195 7.5.1 RM innovation is demand driven Innovation system literature has largely ignored the effects of demands of the health systems on innovation in the medical sector (Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir, 2007). My results indicate that RM is driven by demand for low-cost appropriate health technologies. As I discussed in Chapter 6, there is a desperate need for new treatments for chronic conditions in the emerging economies. Governments, researchers and entrepreneurs have responded to this need with investments of time and money in RM. Demand-driven innovation in healthcare influences the way products are manufactured to fit consumer needs. In order for innovative products that fulfill consumers demand to be successful, tight user-producer relationships must be established throughout the development process. Failures to form successful user-producer relationships may mean that developed products are not suitable or that patients are not receptive to using them. These relationships are of particular importance to health systems, where pharmaceutical products and therapeutic services are both clinically tested and delivered in hospital settings. In RM, donations of cells and tissues from the public form another feedback link, where potential final users supply producers with the materials needed to conduct the initial R&D. Without support from the general public, discarded embryos, adult stem cell samples and cord blood samples would not be available. Affordable technologies. The pressure for affordable products and services is much stronger in Brazil, China and India than in more affluent countries. Some interviewees indicated that China and India had an advantage over international RM research because they were able to generate more cost effective research and products, as many research inputs including labour costs are lower. While some Brazilian researchers believe importation costs have actually made research there more costly than in the West, they indicated that Brazilian researchers were more creative 196 in the laboratory than their Western counterparts due to having to adjust experiments to cut costs or accommodate for importation delays of reagents and equipment. This is akin to the creativity needed in \"scarcity conditions\" described by Sutz (Srinivas and Sutz 2008). Some interviewees from each country stressed that by developing RM products and services in the country, RM therapies would likely be more affordable. There is reason to believe that these countries will be successful in creating RM innovations at a lower price point than their affluent neighbours, as they have in some cases already done in health sciences. For example, Shanta Biotechnics in India has created a hepatitis vaccine which lowers the cost from 500Rs. to 18Rs., or about US40\u00a2, and they now supply 40% of UNICEF's hepatitis B vaccine (Jayaraman 2005b). It is likely that these types of cost reducing innovations are likely for RM as well: bone-marrow transplantation for currently treatable diseases is available in top Indian hospitals at a cost four to five times lower than is offered in developed countries such as the US and UK (Smith, Hillner et al. 1997; Chandy 2008; Chakraborty, Shieh et al. 2009). Applicable technologies. RM therapies are being developed in the emerging economies in response to patient needs. For example, doctor visitations can be quite cumbersome in China where quality clinics may be difficult to access outside city centres. One gene therapy company in China, Vector Technology Company Ltd., is developing a new treatment for rheumatoid arthritis that would decrease the number of hospital visits required by the patient, as well as decreasing the cost of treatment by at least half. Researchers in China and Brazil are interested in developing a treatment for diabetes that could decrease or eliminate dependence on insulin injections. By understanding what patients need from therapies, RM treatments may be able to reduce healthcare costs and make treatments more appropriate, even before full cures are available. This is in agreement with the findings of Gajewski and Robertson, who report 197 differences in how allogenic bone-marrow transplantation (BMT) is used to treat cancers in India and China compared to more affluent countries. The decision process was influenced by the need to provide care at lower costs or provide patients with an appropriate cost structure, and to accommodate the unique needs of patients travelling to the clinic from outside city centres (Gajewski and Robinson 2007). Culturally appropriate technologies. Products developed indigenously may be designed in closer accordance with local social and cultural norms. In all three countries, the general populations seemed accepting of new technologies where a clear medical or social benefit exist, and key informants believe the public eagerly awaits RM treatments. In China and India, traditional medicines are important to the general population, which may make these cultures more receptive to alternative treatments such as RM. Some interviewees in China and India believe that because the idea of encouraging the body to heal itself is central to many of the traditional medicine practices, these populations may be more receptive to RM. Additionally, China and India do not share the same ethical contentions stem cell research present in some Western countries. Close user-producer relationships are essential. Although it is important to have the support of users during the development of novel products, if products are to reflect their needs, uninformed or indiscriminate support of a high-tech field such as RM can create misunderstandings and unfair expectations from the users. In all three countries, the education level of the general public is insufficient to understand succinctly the research and products being developed in RM5. Media 5 While the general public of Brazil may have heard of stem cells due to widespread media discussion of stem cells, particularly in urban areas, our interviewees often felt that the public did not have any significant understanding of these technologies, which my observations confirmed. Members of the public I spoke with informally did not 198 coverage, including newspapers, television, and radio are largely responsible for general public education on RM, however, most journalists are ill equipped to effectively present these topics to the public. Key informants in China and India indicated that the media was often too positive in their interpretation of RM and was responsible for creating unfair or misleading expectations of RM in the short term. \"Oh I think [the media is] positive, yeah. Too positive. So we, we avoiding to contact the media. Because sometimes they will make small things big.\" [Interview CH12] Key researchers across all three countries indicated that there was still a lot of work to be done before therapies would be ready for general use, but felt that the general public believed the therapies would be soon available. As one researcher stated: \"I always hold the belief that providing a dream is a nice thing. But sciences are not based on the dream. Science actually relies on the actual practice, so we believe that we should give people more practical ideas.\" [Interview CH1] This dichotomy between expectations of researchers and the general public could be harmful in the long-term if researchers avoid reporting results to the domestic media, if users become mistrustful when expectations are not reached, or should harm come to users through premature application of RM. In contrast to the public's overly optimistic view of RM, doctor's hesitations to use RM may act as a barrier to the adoption of new RM therapies and services. Several interviewees indicated that the older generation of doctors, especially outside major cities, did not have sufficient training or understand basic information about how stem cell technology works, or how close RM is to being clinically available. 199 education to understand the relatively new concepts behind RM and that this lead to mistrust of new RM therapies. In particular, the adoption of Chinese approved gene therapy products has been difficult because doctors hesitated to provide it to patients. One gene therapy expert said \"Because of the early stage, education is hard work. Yeah, you need to change the doctor's conception\" [Interview CH10]. Firms producing gene therapies are responding to this difficulty by providing training sessions and educational materials to explain to doctors how gene therapy products work and under which conditions they are of most value to patients. Similarly, stem cell and tissue engineering products and services will need the support of doctors, who mediate the relationship between users and producers. In addition to specialized training, greater consumer confidence could also be created with greater scientific evidence of new RM products' safety and efficacy. 7.5.2 Advantages and disadvantages to engaging in a new high-tech field As I discussed in more depth in Chapter 2, innovation in the South is usually described as a process in which technologies are acquired from developed countries, assimilated, and then adapted to developing countries (Utterback and Abernathy 1975; Kim 1998; Wong 1999; Hobday, Rush et al. 2004). Developing countries are thus latecomers to technological advancement, missing out on the early capture of resources and consumers (Wong 1999). In addition, Wong shows innovation in latecomer developing countries suffers from greater user-producer distances, distances from leading sources of technology and shortages of specialized resources and infrastructure. They do have some advantages: lower resource costs, sheltered markets and knowledge asymmetry may aid innovation for these latecomer developing countries (Wong 1999). 200 While these arguments are well suited for the context for which they were developed, innovation based on a model of reverse engineering may not adequately describe southern innovation in an emerging field such as RM where there are few products to imitate. It follows then that at least some of the characteristics of innovation in the South described in the literature will not accurately describe innovation in RM in the emerging economies. All innovation models developed to explain innovation in the South recognize the importance of adapting technological developments in a manner reflecting the unique characteristics of southern firms. The models however, rely on the assumption that the emerging economies are latecomers. Using a more sectoral approach, I explore here to what extent the latecomer advantages and disadvantages described for the South apply to the RM context, where these countries are not necessarily \"latecomers\" to the field, but could instead be considered early movers. Some of these advantages and disadvantages relate to the late versus early moving, while others relate to the developed versus developing country environment. I find that some of the latecomer advantages described by Wong are largely true for the emerging economies' RM sector as well, such as low resource costs, sheltered markets, and information asymmetry (1999). Although economic progress has resulted in price increases, China and India still benefit from low resource costs, real-estate overheads, and wages compared to developed countries. Language differences and lack of knowledge or mistrust by affluent country firms of developing countries' private-sectors are expected to act as barriers to the arrival of new foreign health care products to developing country domestic markets, which helps to shelter domestic RM firms. Firms are largely not in need of sheltering however, as the immaturity of this field has not yet created intense international competition. Information access asymmetry is also an advantage for emerging economy researchers, who are able to access leading information on RM published in international peer reviewed scientific journals with ease. It is more difficult for the 201 international community to access and read papers published in domestic journals, particularly when languages other than English are used. Several researchers from Brazil and China claim too that international journals are sometimes hesitant to publish research from developing countries, resulting in further information asymmetry. Emerging economies can also benefit from the enormous markets their populations provide. Several key informants in India and China viewed their enormous population as an advantage in RM research and development as it increases access to patients with unique diseases and patient availability for clinical trials of new RM products and therapies. These countries do not miss out on access to customer markets. In fact, China and India have been the first to commercialize gene therapy and stem cell treatments, much to the chagrin of the international science community. The disadvantages of developing country innovation described by Wong (including user-producer distance, distance from technology sources, and shortage of specialized inputs of resources/infrastructure) are largely relevant to the latecomer perspective and do not reflect the situation of RM in the emerging economies. For example, user-producer relationships are typically distant because southern firms would fabricate products for sale in the North. The target market for RM products in the emerging economies, are however their domestic populations, and so RM users and producers enjoy physically close relationships. Similarly, the indigenous created knowledge, sources of technology and resulting capacity and infrastructure are domestically maintained. The emerging economies do, however, suffer certain disadvantages owing to their developing country environments, including limited funding and the difficulties with building infrastructure and specialized knowledge in the short term. Emerging economies have been dedicating funding 202 to RM, but they simply do not have the financial resources that other countries are able to provide. Government grants are the principal source of funding, as little resources are available from private or venture capital groups. Private domestic investors are few - and the few that are there are hesitant to invest in RM, which they see as high risk with little potential for short term returns. In the words of an interviewee from a new RM firm struggling with the costs of clinical trials, \"It is hard. It's long. The experience is long time and the cost is very very high\" [Interview CH0]. Many firms have little access to venture capital or to investors willing to wait for long timelines needed for RM product returns, making the sustainability of RM firms during this pre-market phase very difficult. Knowledge is arguably harder to create in the short term in multidisciplinary and science intensive fields such as RM than it is for more industry based fields. The availability of skilled individuals in high-tech fields can be a limitation for developing countries interested in perusing innovative research. Skilled personnel need to be educated, trained and provided with sufficient opportunities to make staying in their home country personally rewarding. The reform needed from academic institutions to train the next generation is difficult, costly, and far from immediate, although an essential part of a long-term solution. Despite some \"brain gain\" strategies that China has employed, brain drain of skilled human resources is still a major problem and researchers in the emerging economies loose many of their highly trained students to the developed world for educational training or employment. Emerging economies also do not have the same infrastructure to support science intensive or biomedical fields that is already available in more affluent countries. Research equipment, high-tech laboratories, clinical and preclinical facilities are all essential to biomedical innovation. Bureaucracy and red tape are often endemic problems and regulatory clarity and enforcement are 203 sometimes lacking in the emerging economies. Governments can provide supportive policies and make important reforms, but all investments need to be prioritized along side the development of other social, medical and scientific programs. RM development has been largely successful despite the above challenges and all three countries have managed the infrastructure, investments, personnel and creativity to make RM programs happen in their countries. This capacity, however, is not necessarily equally distributed throughout the country. Capacity may remain locked in city centres, as is further discussed in Chapter 8. Finally, even when emerging economies make progress in a field like RM, they still have to overcome a perceived bias from the international community that good science does not come from developing countries. 7.6 Conclusions My analytical review of the RM sector in the emerging economies has led me to draw four main conclusions: First, the decentralized role of firms in these RM innovation systems shows the importance of looking at innovation from a systemic perspective. Secondly, innovation can occur in emerging economies in sectors that have not reached scientific and technological maturity. Thirdly, this innovation can be appropriate and beneficial for the domestic population. Lastly, this high-tech innovation occurs under conditions unique to RM and unique to emerging and developing countries. This study also shows that instead of innovation being centralized largely around firms, other organizations such as universities, research institutes and hospitals have a very important role in RM innovation. The RM innovation systems in my countries of interest are composed of many types of actors, some of which are unique to medical or RM fields. Lundvall has suggested that 204 even in the South, firms should be seen as central to innovation and should be the focus of study of innovation in developing countries (Lundvall 2007). Here, I conclude that study of a broader set of innovation actors is appropriate until the role of firms for different sectors of developing countries is better understood. Together with the case studies, this chapter shows that newly emerging technologies in high-tech sectors are not necessarily out of reach of emerging economies. Brazil, China and India have jump-started a new high-tech sector through direct financial, political, and human resource inputs. Because RM is a globally emerging field, they cannot rely on international transfers of RM technology into the domestic health system. Nor are their final products available for reverse engineering. Instead, these countries have invested heavily in the development of indigenous RM capacity. The second conclusion has several important repercussions for the innovation system framework. I have shown that China, India and Brazil are making significant innovations in RM and that this innovation cannot be dependent on a reverse engineering model or latecomer firm strategies. Innovation then occurs through mechanisms not sufficiently explained in the innovation system literature up to this point. I have also shown instead that the emerging economies use a variety of innovation strategies to develop RM. More research on the process of innovation in other emerging sectors and other developing countries will be needed to develop models of southern innovation that capture these other innovation processes. The third conclusion made in this chapter is that the development of high-tech sectors in emerging economies may be beneficial in nature to the country in question. Kim concludes in his interpretation of southern innovation by recommending that the South focus on exports and acquiring turnkey plants and capital goods (Wong 1999). Often, these types of high-tech 205 innovations include technologies that are neither important to their domestic market nor economically affordable to the general population (such as televisions or software). On the other hand, a clear objective of RM is to serve an increasingly important domestic health need and to provide cost effective solutions to incurable diseases. The development of high-tech sectors that reflect domestic demands, particularly in basic-need sectors such as health or potentially agriculture, benefit from greater proximity between users and producers. Indigenous development of these technologies increases domestic capacity, and allows the development of economically and culturally relevant products designed for local problems. This conclusion indicates that there is an important role for innovation to play in the high-tech fields of emerging economies. In particular, high-tech innovation in an emerging field can be particularly beneficial in areas of research and development where there is a clear market need or benefit to the local domestic population, such as in healthcare. Policies thus should not necessarily focus exclusively on export-based fields, but should consider the development of high-tech fields that can concurrently have potential positive social, economic, and market effects. The last conclusion - that RM innovation occurs under conditions unique to RM and unique to emerging and developing countries - builds on the second and third conclusions and begins to explore the distinctive characteristics of innovation systems in emerging and developing countries. Some of the characteristics I discuss may be context specific, whereas others may be attributable to socio-economic status and thus relevant to a wide range of countries. More study is needed to define those characteristics that are more universally applicable. For example, most developing countries would likely benefit from low resource prices, sheltered markets, and knowledge asymmetry. Some sectors will benefit from close user-producer relationships more than others, depending on the local market for the technology. For RM, user-producer interactions are important for both the North and the South, even if the demands each places on 206 the technology differ. Users have had a huge impact on RM innovation globally: innovation in some countries has been stalled or stunted due to user's discomfort with embryonic stem cell research, and gene therapy trials were also temporarily stopped following the death of one participant in the United States, which decreased consumer and regulatory confidence in clinical use of gene therapy. Emerging economies have invested in RM as part of a quest to become more knowledge based economies. Because RM is still in its infancy, the emerging economies are joining the international community on equal footing in this field and have a real chance to make a global impact. In order to have an impact on markets, governments and corporations need to act early on. Discoveries made in the field can influence the direction and priorities of the field; without the contributions from emerging economies, their strengths, resources and needs will not play part in determining the development path of sectors such as RM. 7.7 References C-TRACER.

RM could have important public health and economic implications for these countries, yet there is no evidence that RM will develop across these countries evenly. Here I examine RM capacity distribution and show that the unequal development of different regions and cities within emerging economies prohibits all but a few regions or hubs to develop the critical capacity necessary to pursue high-tech fields such as RM. I analyse factors that have encouraged RM development in particular cities or regions. I base my discussion on evidence from case studies of the RM fields of Brazil, China and India, including analysis of interviews with 150 in-country RM experts, policy documents, scientometrics, laws, primary and grey literature, and my own field observations. Emerging economies are driven to develop RM to make new affordable treatments for their domestic health needs, but it is essential that RM therapies not become locked in major city centres, or I posit that RM clusters could contribute to growing inequalities of health and socio-economics in the developing world. 215 8.2 Introduction There is strong evidence in the regional system of innovation (RSI) literature and cluster literature that high-tech and science-based industries have a tendency to accumulate in particular geographic areas. These regions or clusters are defined as geographic proximate concentrations of high-tech firms in a particular field, as well as their related organizations, support industries and institutions (Porter 1998; Porter 2000). The case studies of RM in Brazil, China and India indicate that RM research is primarily located in only a handful of cities. This chapter discusses these clusters to identify their characteristics and implications for policy and RM development. While many believe that biotechnology clusters and regions can arise naturally, many authors have discussed how policy can help develop new clusters (see for example Mytelka and Farinelli 2000; Enright 2001; Feldman and Francis 2004; Trippl and Todtling 2007). Some areas - which Enright has called \"potential clusters\" - may already have many of the competencies necessary to support the development of a particular field, but lack the critical mass to spontaneously develop (Enright 2001; Trippl and Todtling 2007). These are the areas that may respond to supportive government programs, funding and policies. While this has important potential for developing countries, little empirical work has been undertaken in developing countries to identifying high-tech clusters or their characteristics. Until now, no study has explored the characteristics of RM clusters in these countries. There is also limited understanding of how the geography of RM capacity may impact the innovation process, in particular access to RM therapies once they are ready. I have shown in previous chapters that Brazil, China and India are making important progress developing RM therapies for local health needs, but the question remains if the system is set up to deliver these 216 health benefits. If the critical capacity of fields such as RM clusters in limited geographic areas, it could have profound impact on both the development and distribution of the new technology. Literature focused on innovation systems in developing countries has largely failed to addressed the specific need for poverty-reducing and socially inclusive innovation (Lorentzen and Mohamed 2009; Altenburg 2010). Emerging technologies such as RM have enormous potential to transform health systems for the better - which may induce positive economic, social and developmental change - but the degree to which these changes are achieved may depend to a large extent on the characteristics of the systems in which these innovations are developed. This chapter will describe the characteristics of RM clusters, and discuss how the development of RM clusters may impact health and development in these countries. 8.3 Methods The discussion presented in this Chapter is based on the case studies and case study comparisons presented earlier. Please see Chapter 3 for a detailed description of the methodology used. 8.4 Results & discussion My previous case studies and case comparison shows that China, India and Brazil have been largely successful at developing domestic RM innovation. Here I continue the discussion of RM across these three countries by showing the uneven distribution of RM competencies and its potential implications. I identify the RM clusters of Brazil, China and India and show how some cities have developed the critical capacity necessary to pursue advanced scientific endeavors such as RM while other cities do not yet have the human resources and infrastructure to follow. 217 8.4.1 Unequal economic development leads to clusters of RM capacity My research shows RM developments in Brazil, China and India are centralized to a few large urban centres, with a number of secondary centres also engaging in important work. In Brazil, these primary centres were located in S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, with some activity in several other major urban centres including Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Curitiba, Petr\u00f3polis, Belo Horizonte, and Salvador. In China, research activities were centralized to Shanghai and Beijing, with a few other cities also involved, including for example Changsha, Shenzhen, Tianjin, and Chonquing and Guangzhou. While RM activities were more diffuse in India, research was still centralized to a handful of large cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, with additional work being done in cities including Pune and Vellore. National policy tended to be developed in the national capitals. In Brazil, most policy groups, regulators and funding agencies are located in Brazil's capital Bras\u00edlia. In addition, the intellectual property office of Brazil called INPI is located in Rio de Janeiro. Funding strategies, policies IP protection and regulations are largely developed in the Chinese state capital of Beijing and the Indian capital of Delhi. Some cities and states also have important agencies that develop regulation, funding and policy for their jurisdictions. Developing critical capacity is both particularly important and particularly difficult for interdisciplinary subjects like RM. A strong science base across the many disciplines related to RM needs to be developed - including genetics, engineering, information technology, material engineering, genomics, molecular biology, and surgery among others. These disciplines need to collaborate together in order for RM to be successful: 218 \"None of the researches can be carried out in the closed room. For example, I'm only know the area of materials, some people only know the area of cells, or human body structure, so nowadays the all the research needs to be carried out like openly in a more interaction environment.\" [Interview CH14] Large cities are more likely to have accumulated the skilled base, the infrastructure, and the financial resources to support RM. In the words of one interviewee: \"Regenerative medicine is complex. So you need the support of academic groups and knowledge in manipulating cells and so on. The know-how has to be present and then you have to have the minimum critical mass of brains and intuitions that work together. And this you can't get anywhere. You get it in S\u00e3o Paulo of course, and in cities [in the South] But it gets very poor when you go up [North].\" [Interview BR8] Clustering of scientific capacity to a limited number of city centres is not unique to developing countries; regions of any country become specialized to certain areas or sectors. In the emerging economies however, it seems this clustering effect is a product of the inherent inequality of development between regions of these countries. While the emerging economies have recently benefited from high rates of economic growth, this increased economic development has not benefited these countries uniformly (see for example, Datt and Ravallion 1990; Ferreira, Lanjouw et al. 2003; Wan 2007). Some urban centres have developed more quickly than other regions, increasing the gaps in equality between rich and poor. The lack of economic growth in other parts of these countries has been prohibitive to the development of institutions and infrastructure needed to develop a high-tech research program. This has resulted in variable science and technology capacity, locking some cities out of participation in science-intensive fields. In the words of one interviewee: 219 \"There is a clear correlation between scientific competence and economic development...We have the complexity in Brazil that 80% of the social problems and natural resources as well are in the north and north-west of Brazil. But 80% of the competence is in the South-east and South.\" [Interview BR36] Both a critical amount of infrastructure and a critical mass of skilled personnel is necessary for a city to support a RM research program, which is largely unobtainable by less developed areas. The need for critical mass of infrastructure is exemplified by the following quote: \"The state of S\u00e3o Paulo is the most developed state in Brazil. So our universities are the most developed too... There are very deep differences [in how medical innovation develops].\" [Interview BR12] There are successful RM research programs in the emerging economies, but my interviews indicate that the limited number of trained individuals in RM is a key limiting factors to the growth of the RM field there. One interviewee stated: \"While India is moving very fast, we have - even in this given area - the number of highly qualified people in the area is very small\" [Interview IN19] While many science and medicine graduates are produced by the emerging economies, the quality of science education is often inconsistent across these countries and finding personnel with specialized training in RM can be difficult. Several of my interviewees from all three countries felt that while there were high numbers of science graduates, what is increasingly important is not the quantity of graduates but the quality of their education. For example, one interviewee stated: 220 \"I would say there is not a lack of manpower as such, it is quality work. Quality work which is, you know, well peer-reviewed and well understood by everyone else.\" [Interview IN6] The education institutions of all three countries need to be strengthened so that similar standards can be reached across the country. Interviewees called for more specialized courses - for both technical fields such as stem cell culturing and tissue engineering, and also for other related fields including intellectual property and business management. 8.4.2 Critical capacity is difficult to build in new locations Both India and Brazil have tried to create RM clusters; India by building on existing infrastructure and Brazil by trying to jump-start science in underdeveloped regions of the country. In India, the ICMR and the Department of Biotechnology announced in 2005 its intentions to link privately and publicly funded research on stem cells in cities with strong stem cell programs, enabling them to share equipment and facilities, and to create greater linkages between researchers and clinicians. City clusters were planed for Delhi, Vellore, Hyderabad, Pune and Bangalore. One interviewee described his support for the plan: \"I just think its some person needs some kind of centre, maybe what some call a city cluster...where people can come work together, full efficacy and every institute doesn't have to build up all the faculties required. Because its quite expensive, even by international standards.\" [Interview IN23] Very little information is available on these cluster building initiatives, however, and more research is needed to see if they were fully implemented and if these city clusters were successful in integrating large city research initiatives. 221 The Ministry of Health of Brazil has tried to create more equitable development through increased funding for science and technology to underdeveloped areas of the country. Some interviewees believe that decentralization of science is essential to development: \"It's very unequal here in Brazil. We have in S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio, Rio Grande do Sul, and Minas Gerais, we have the top of the researchers. A lot of building capacity, a lot of laboratories...we are putting money in the other states so they can grow up.\" [Interview BR40] This strategy of promoting science equality did also extend to strategies to increase stem cell research in the north and west of Brazil. Interviewees expressed that there were significant employment opportunities in these parts of Brazil. These opportunities are attractive to young researchers as few new jobs are created in the public research institutions of the RM active cities and there are few employment opportunities for PhD graduates in industry. One interviewee stated: \"If you want to develop the whole country, you will have to encourage people to move to other areas to develop their own areas,\" [Interview BR30]. Interviewees felt however, that most skilled scientists would rather struggle to find an academic position in the larger better-developed cities because the availability of investigators, high quality students, and equipment were limited in north and west of Brazil and are critical to the successful development of a research lab. Collaboration is of particular importance in Brazil, where borrowing equipment and supplies from neighbouring labs and institutions can help mitigate some of the bureaucratic and infrastructural problems surrounding the importation of lab supplies and equipment. In an emerging and multidisciplinary field such as RM, student collaborations help distribute tacit or discipline specific knowledge, skills and techniques. These types of collaboration require a critical mass of on-site investigators. In the words of one interviewee: 222 \"One of my ex-students went [to Parana] to set up an islet unit. They got all kinds of equipment, they have a beautiful bio-clean room. No work came out of it, nothing. ... I think it depends on critical mass. Like you need to have a number of people, qualified people to really get something happening.\" [Interview BR34] Although it is a laudable goal to develop scientific capacity in impoverished regions of emerging economies, it seems difficult to germinate RM programs in these areas. While financial resources may help develop infrastructure, they seem insufficient to develop the multidisciplinary competencies needed from well-established scientists. Efforts to develop new RM clusters are necessary, but efforts cannot be spread too thin or they risk missing out on the potential to create the critical mass necessary to create strong projects that can succeed. One interviewee expressed these concerns, based on his experiences: \"I started a biotechnology network in the north-east of Brazil. I said, okay guys, you have 17% of the science, if you don't get together it could disperse and you're going to have nine mediocre projects in biotech, but if you have one strong project, you have a change.\" [Interview BR31] Brazil may have better success creating RM programs in the north and west of Brazil if efforts are targeted towards accumulating capacity in a few key areas instead of widely dispersing programs across these regions. 8.4.3 Characteristics of RM active cities The previous section shows that unequal economic development has allowed some cities to develop critical scientific capacity to engage in RM while others have been left behind. Richer cities are more likely to develop the critical capacity needed to innovate in RM, but other local 223 characteristics are likely also important to regional RM development. I identified from the data the following factors that encourage RM innovation in a particular city: availability of localized funding, local political support, incentives for starting firms, and access to key research resources. 8.4.3.1 Localized funding According to interviewees, local science and technology agencies provide important funding and grant opportunities. In China, for example, the Shanghai Science and Technology Bureau provided funding to many of the researchers I interviewed there. In Brazil, researchers felt the state funded R&D agency for the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, FAPESP, has been paramount to the development of science and technology in the state. While funding inconsistency is in general a problem in Brazil, FAPESP's success is based on the high level of consistent financing it provides. FAPESP receives a fixed percentage of state taxes by law that is not liable to change with succeeding governments. This science funding stability has made S\u00e3o Paulo one of the leading hubs of research in the country, attracting highly trained researchers, and accumulating much of Brazil's high-tech scientific equipment. Interviewees indicated that the state funding agencies of several other states were improving after following some of FAPESP's strategies. However, several interviewees acknowledged that FAPESP will likely always be the strongest of these state funding agencies because it is supported by taxes from the richest state. 8.4.3.2 Political support According to the interviewees, political support can be an important motivator for RM development. In China, several interviewees indicated that research was easier to conduct in 224 Beijing compared to Shanghai because Shanghai is \"too political\", which created additional bureaucratic hardships. In the words of one interviewee: \"Current research [in Shanghai] doesn't work because of the administration. What they destroy is not just a lab but the base for innovation... The soil here is wrong, the administration is inhibiting.\" [Interview CH25] China's largest RM firm, Beike Biotechnology, is located in Shenzhen, an industrial city in the South of China. The unproven treatments offered by this company are controversial, but both my research and that of Chen (Chen 2009) indicate this firm has found Shenzhen local government supportive of their activities. According to their website, Beike Biotechnology was founded in part with investment capital from the Shenzhen City administration and the Shenzhen's provincial government. One interviewee from Shenzhen stated: \"The government is very supportive in Shenzhen... I think here it's just more open. If you go to Beijing it's just more difficult.\" [Interview CH28] 8.4.3.3 Incentives for Firms Several representatives from firms indicated that their cities provided special support for new start up companies. For example, according to this research, Excellion Servi\u00e7os Biom\u00e9dicos in Brazil was built in Petr\u00f3polis due to the tax incentives for firms there and its close proximity to the city of Rio de Janerio. Other firms in China and Brazil indicated similar advantages, or cited business incubation programs as another incentive supporting RM firms. This is true at a country level as well: interviewees indicated that Brazil's innovation law has facilitated the development of RM firms by allowing employees of public institutions to hold positions in industry concurrently and by providing support for PhDs to enter industry. 225 8.4.3.4 Access to key resources The availability of unique resources in some cities also facilitates RM research. Changsha in China developed a large stem cell research centre, which is associated with a hospital that specializes in reproductive health and IVF. This centre was the first in the world to report the isolation and characterization of a homozygous human embryonic stem cell line from a parthenogenetic oocyte following IVF treatment (Lin, OuYang et al. 2007). The facility has built up expertise in developmental biology and has access to excess or unviable embryos that can be used, with consent of the parents and following all national regulations, for stem cell research. Interviewees cited access to hospitals and other institutions experienced in conducting medical research and clinical trials as important to all three countries. For example, Ribeir\u00e3o Preto - a smaller city of S\u00e3o Paulo state - has developed what I believe to be the third largest hub of RM activity in Brazil. Ribeir\u00e3o Preto has a highly reputed medical university with strong ties to several hospitals. 8.5 Ensuring access to future RM therapies Chapter 6 shows that one of the main motivations for Brazil, China and India to engage in RM is to assure that any medical treatments that are developed in the field be accessible to their domestic populations. The impression that developing countries can profit most from new health biotechnologies if they participate in their development has been gaining traction (for example see Juma and Yee-Cheong 2005; Singer, Berndtson et al. 2007; Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir, Singer et al. 2007) While it is clear from this research that China, India and Brazil have made strides to develop RM technology, my results indicate it is not yet clear if these technologies will be accessible by the poor of these countries. 226 Efforts to develop RM therapies alone will be insufficient to ensure these therapies have an impact - access to new therapies is imperative. Several factors may affect the potential uptake of new RM therapies. For example, the political and healthcare strategies of each country will to some extent determine the government's responsibility to ensure the access to RM therapies. In Brazil, the government is responsible for primary health care, which is free at the point of need, although private hospitals also operate. In China, cost of RM therapies will depend on whether the individual has insurance and whether the policies cover RM therapies. India has both public and private hospitals, and RM access may depend on availability of these therapies in the public healthcare domain. The health infrastructure available in each country, as well as the availability of clinical grade stem cells, will likely also affect RM therapy uptake. The media plays a large role in determining the type of information about RM therapies that is available to the public, and may influence attitudes towards RM. Additionally, doctors - the middle man between users and producers - must be trained and educated about RM therapies so they may provide or recommend these therapies to patients. Socio-economic inequality is another important factor influencing RM access. Below I discuss how poverty may affect access to RM therapies and RM clustering may exacerbate differential access and contribute to growing the divide between rich and poor. 8.5.1 Socio-economic inequality may impact RM access Socio-economic factors may have a large effect on future access to RM therapies. The interviewees were unsure if RM therapies would be affordable for the general population. As shown in Table 8.1, access to affordable essential medicine is already a major barrier to health in Brazil and India. While greater access is available in China, access is far from universal and is still rated as \"medium\" by the United Nations (United Nations 2004). All three countries still 227 have significant portions of their populations living in poverty, and over a 30-40% of incomes are held by the richest 10% of the populations. Patients that cannot access or afford current essential medicines are unlikely to be able to access future RM therapies. In the words of one interviewee: \"The major barrier [to RM in India] is to have the technology for everyone to access [...] There are two types of poor in India. The poor and the very poor. At the moment, the very poor, whatever the price, can not access it.\" [IN19] Some interviewees stressed that although RM may not be affordable to the poor if they had to purchase the therapy out of pocket, RM will likely be more affordable than the cost of living with the illness, given the costs incurred by therapies, or the opportunity costs of lost incomes from sick individuals and from the family and friends that care for them. Table 8.1: A look at socio-economic factors that may affect access to future regenerative medicine therapies and poverty levels in China, India and Brazil.

The centralization of high-tech health capacity to certain cities does cause concern that RM technologies being developed by emerging economies may become locked to the major urban centres in which they were developed, accessible to the most affluent of these cities: \"Regenerative medicine won't be very spread all around the health institutions. I think there will be spots and regions, strategic spots, but [it will be] in that place because there it is possible to apply a new technology because the technical teams are able to and so on.\" [Interview BR7] If RM therapies became locked to city centres and are only available to the rich, these therapies could contribute to making these areas richer and healthier. The degree to which stem cells therapies benefit the poor will likely depend also on the commercial pathway stem cells take. It is not yet clear if RM therapies will be available as a product that can be manufactured, distributed and administered - similar in nature to pharmaceuticals. If so, even if RM therapies are largely produced in urban centres, they may still be distributed to clinics and hospitals in other areas similar to the way drugs and vaccines are distributed. However, if RM treatments more closely resemble a service or surgical technique, it must then be completely administered by healthcare workers. RM clustering may then have significant implications for access, as these services would require both the facilities and the 229 trained personnel to administer these treatments, both which cannot be easily \"shipped\" outside of RM research and development clusters. While it is possible not all RM therapies will follow one model or the other, it does seems likely at this time that most stem cell therapies will be offered as a healthcare service distributed in hospitals. If RM therapies develop following a more service-oriented model, the complexity of the therapy will have important implications for access. One of the stem cell tourism companies in China has established a network of over 30 hospitals, most of them in cities with little current RM capacity. This suggests that if RM therapies that are developed are simple enough, smaller city hospitals may be able to effectively distribute these treatments. Unfortunately, the commercial pathway of stem cells is not yet clear. Stem cell therapies currently in clinical trials vary widely in cell type and the amount of cell manipulation and culturing prior to administering the therapy. It is thus uncertain at this time the degree of specialized skill and complexity of facilities that will be required by clinical protocols. While the least intensive therapies should be easily reproducible in smaller urban centres with less training and facilities, it is equally possible that final protocols will require infrastructure and training beyond the current capacity of all but the largest urban centres. If so, RM therapies could contribute to the widening of the gap in health and socio-economics between different geographic areas, between urban and rural, and between socio-economic classes. While the commercial paths of RM products and services cannot be foretold, we need to begin considering the distribution and uptake of these therapies now so that barriers to their uptake across Brazil, India and China can be minimized. 230 8.6 Conclusions Poverty in even the richer developing countries has important implications for the development of technological capacity. Unequal developments geographically in my countries of study have limited capacity for RM research to only certain major cities. Socio-economic inequality also limits the ability of citizens to access essential affordable medicines, indicating that universal access to RM therapies is unlikely without profound socio-economic change. The development of RM clusters may further reinforce these socio-economic barriers, by limiting RM treatments to only those who can afford them in major urban centres. The findings of this chapter agree in nature with findings presented by Sutz, who shows that \"fostering innovation and increasing inequalities often come together, particularly in underdeveloped countries\" (Sutz and Arocena 2006). In sectors that serve basic needs, such as health, this is particularly problematic. It is essential that we begin looking at ways to better harness innovation in developing countries to better address the needs of those who need it most. Previous chapters of this thesis show that China, India and Brazil have successfully built up RM programs in their countries with significant government support and funding. While these programs are national in nature, RM capacity is centralized to several major urban centres that represent more developed parts of the country, and where sufficient competencies, institutions and infrastructure had already been accumulated. A government push may then have been sufficient to allow these areas to spontaneously develop, similar to how Enright describes potential clusters (2001). The later part of this chapter discussed how clustering may increase health disparities, but RM clustering is not inherently a negative characteristic - this research suggests that the 231 centralization of activities in the emerging economies may be the best way to build globally competitive research programs in high-tech fields with limited resources. Further research is needed to test the extent to which clustering can help development of RM or other high-tech fields. My results show some large cities have also developed specific competencies or resources that make their RM programs competitive, including local funding, firm incentives, access to key resources, and local political support. These too should be explored to see to what extent these strategies could be employed in other settings. Creating capacity can be difficult, and I suggest that perhaps not all areas are sufficiently developed to be responsive to these initiatives; investments in RM may be more effective if targeted to areas that seem to have accumulated sufficient infrastructure and multidisciplinary skills to qualify as a \"potential cluster\". Brazil has spent considerable time and resources to develop the scientific capacity of the less developed parts of the country, but at least for RM, there has been little progress so far, although more time and research will be needed to evaluate its long-term success. While scientific investment may be important to the development of peripheral areas, the multidisciplinary nature of RM may make RM programs better suited to areas that already have built basic competency across several core scientific areas. Large investments for RM may provide little return where there is insufficient critical mass of infrastructure and personnel, particularly when investments are spread over a large area and number of projects. More research on clustering in new emerging fields in developing countries is important - resources are too scarce to waste on wishful thinking clusters instead of the potential clusters that can be transformed with a few well-targeted initiatives. The development of RM clusters does not dictate that economic and health benefits are exclusive to the main urban centres, although additional attention may be needed to ensure these benefits 232 are fully shared. If RM therapies are accessible beyond the cities in which they are developed, areas not well suited to RM research may be better suited to R&D of other high-tech or medical fields. For example, the north and west of Brazil have built important competencies in biodiversity related research and tropical medicine. Investments in infectious and parasitic disease may build the medical competences and clinical capacity needed for future RM use, even if little of the initial R&D occurs in these regions. China, India and Brazil have a lot to gain by investing in RM. RM treatments could have profound impact to the health development of the country and if developing countries participate in the development of health biotechnology products, there is greater chance that products will be accessible, affordable and appropriate to their needs. Even if RM technologies never come to fruition, investments in RM still build the scientific capacity of the country needed for a variety of health technologies, including top lab facilities for various fields, cell and tissue banks, preclinical animal facilities, clinical testing facilities as well as building the pool of qualified researchers and clinicians to run them. The creation of new jobs in research and industry can help to retain or return the intellectual capacity of these countries by slowing brain drain and increasing brain gain, as seen in particular by China's recruitment strategies. Regardless of whether RM research remains clustered or is developed more broadly, mechanisms to make RM therapies accessible are essential for RM if it is to contribute to health equitably. What governments and scholars alike need to recognize is that the prioritizations of medical development in some regions may marginalize others; it is important to begin now thinking about how to ensure access to new medical technologies, particularly those that are being prioritized by government policies and heavily invested in with public funds. Mechanisms by which patients can access affordable, appropriate therapies need to be developed and put in 233 place. Where research is not possible, other initiatives may increase access to RM products and services, such as increasing the lab facilities for cell extraction outside major cities, and providing education and training programs for doctors to increase understanding of RM technologies. The national stem cell banks and development of clinical protocols that have already begun in each country may be helpful in ensuring wide access to RM technologies. Hospitals outside city centres can be actively engaged in multi-centre stem cell clinical trials, which may increase the capacity of these areas to participate in RM clinical activities. Governments can also push to have the cost of successful RM therapies covered by public healthcare or by insurance coverage. While participation in new emerging fields of medicine hold great potential for these countries' populations, great strides are needed to ensure that scientific and medical advances do not further entrench and marginalize those who need them most. 8.7 References Altenburg, T.

The research tells stories of great success - China leapt to become the fifth most prolific source of stem cell publications in the world, Brazil has initiated clinical trials in diabetes, stroke, and cardiovascular disease, and India has grown hundreds of new corneas for patients with eye trauma. It is equally a story of great challenges: some researchers wait up to a year for common supplies, firms struggle to locate the financing needed to push products to the clinic, and commercial availability of unproven and untested stem cell therapies has threatened the credibility of the entire stem cell fields of China and India. Each chapter has contributed its own stories and distinct conclusions; I will not repeat these here. Instead, I discuss the wider relevance and implications of my research, and indicate areas for future work. I will first, however, briefly revisit the research questions here to show that my initial objectives have been addressed. I ask what the state of RM is in China and Brazil, and ask what strengths and challenges Brazil and China have faced in the development of RM. While Chapters 4 and 5 237 explore these questions in depth, it suffices to say here that innovative work is being done - largely in the public academic sphere, but also in hospitals and by the private sector, including by cord blood banks. China's stem cell sector is large and prolific, but the quality of the treatments being commercialized has been questioned. Brazil contrarily has a much smaller stem cell sector, with tightly controlled clinical stem cell research, but needs to overcome some systemic barriers to scientific developments if RM is to prosper. The next question I pose inquires why Brazil, China and India are investing in RM. I find that the reasons are threefold in Chapter 6. Firstly, countries are desperate to produce new therapies to treat local diseases. Some of these are chronic diseases that are prevalent worldwide, such as diabetes, heart disease and stroke. Others are endemic to the area, such as the cardiomyopathies resulting from the parasitic tropical Chagas disease. Regardless, these countries hope that investing in RM will result in appropriate, affordable treatments that will be available locally sooner than if they depend on the importation of these technologies. The second reason to invest in RM that I identified is that these countries do not want to be left behind. They have invested in RM in part because the newness of RM has contributed to a more even playing field where everyone is starting out, and where the emerging economies feel they can make important contributions. The hesitation of some countries - such as the US's hesitation to invest federally in hESC research - has furthered the perception that RM is currently a strategic investment. The third reason why emerging economies are investing in RM differs in degree between countries, but suggests that the state's responsibility to care for the health of its population has an associated responsibility to invest in potentially important sources of treatments and cures for prevalent diseases. 238 The last remaining questions relate to how RM capacity has been built, the strategies used to encourage RM, and the lessons learned comparing RM in these three emerging economies. While these are addressed throughout my analysis, they are the focus of parts of Chapters 6-8. Chapter 6 summarizes the inputs needed to build RM capacity, including government support infrastructure, human resources, good governance and linkages between stake-holders. I identified some of the lessons learned from across the three countries based on the strategies used to build these inputs, as summarized in Table 6.3. I then discuss how unequal development has lead to clustering of RM capacity, and identify characteristics and strategies cities engaging in RM, including localized funding sources, firm incentives, political support, and access to key resources. 9.2 RM in emerging economies: a topic of international importance My research and interactions with the research communities of Europe and North America suggest that the North is not well aware of the activities of the emerging economies in RM, some believing that RM is beyond their reach. I have shown the formal literature, too, barely discusses the RM developments of these countries. It is therefore surprising to some that China, India and Brazil are active in RM research and development. This project has demonstrated that these countries are building competitive RM programs and have contributed innovative ideas to the field. It begins to fill in the literature on this topic, by providing an overview of the activities that different types of stake-holders or innovation actors are engaging in, by reviewing the challenges and successes of RM in these countries and by analysing the characteristics underpinning the process of RM innovation in these countries. 239 Understanding RM developments in emerging economies has global relevance and relevance to Canadians. Firstly, scientific development anywhere in the world can impact the global competitiveness of firms, and emerging economies are potentially important players that are not well understood. Secondly, RM has significant relevance for the treatment of chronic disease burdens in developing countries, and global health is increasingly recognized as an international responsibility. Thirdly, in addition to these factors, patients from developed countries such as Canada have unprecedented access to information and international mobility. Research estimates that hundreds to thousands of patients seek unproven stem cell treatments around the world (Zarzeczny, Rachul et al. 2010). Medical tourism can provide patients with legitimate medical alternatives to local care - for example hip resurfacing surgeries are offered in India's hospital at internationally high standards of care for a fraction of the cost of western facilities, and with almost no wait time (Mudur 2004). Medical tourism can allow developing countries to take advantage of their low overhead costs and generate revenue from international patients. The stem cell treatments being sought in China and India differ significantly, however, in that they have no evidence of safety or efficacy backing them up. Patients choose to go abroad because these therapies are not legally available in their jurisdictions, and in doing so, potentially place themselves at health and financial risk. It also places the responsibility and cost of follow-up care, including mitigating any negative side-effects, squarely on the patient's home country. For all of the above reasons, RM developments in China, India and Brazil have significant real-world importance beyond their national boarders. It is imperative that the research and development of RM being conducted in these countries is understood, including the regulatory frameworks, government oversight, the RM innovations occurring in organizations conducting peer-reviewed research, as well as the work conducted by organizations that are operating outside international scientific research standards. 240 9.3 Major contributions This thesis presents an empirical and comprehensive overview of RM case studies of China and Brazil. It presents not only an account of what is happening on the ground, but also analyses the challenges and successes that can help inform future development. The Brazil case study showcases some of the important accomplishments of the Brazilian stem cell sector - Brazil has developed innovative treatments for diabetes and stroke, has funded a large stem cell clinical trial for heart disease, and was the first to successfully regenerated rat tooth crowns from adult dental stem cells. Despite these successes, RM in Brazil has been virtually ignored in the current literature. The China study identifies and describes the regulatory loopholes by which China has been able to offer stem cell treatments, a process that had not been well understood in the literature or even by many of my Chinese interviewees. The China case study also represents one of the first accounts of the stem cell tourism centres based on empirical evidence. Although these centres are the primary topic of interest in the literature, only two studies have conducted face-to-face interviews with any of these centres, and none have put this into a systemic perspective created from the opinions and reflections about these centres from other RM-related groups in China1. This thesis also analyses developments across all three emerging economies found to be significantly investing in this field. It shows that the three countries have had very different 1 These two publications have conducted research on Beike Biotechnology, one of the stem cell treatment centers in China, and neither looks at it in context of the regenerative medicine field. The first studied Beike Biotech as an example of innovative health technologies being produced by China's private sector (Frew, Sammut et al. 2008). The second used Beike Biotech as one of three case studies of groups translating research to the clinic (Chen 2009). In both cases, Beike Biotech was the only stem cell therapy centre interviewed and the case was not put in context of the RM sector, which I have done using the reflections and opinions about Chinese stem cell tourism from other members of the RM sector. 241 narratives of RM development, particularly with respect to stem cell regulation: Brazil's battle over embryonic stem cell research portrays a more conservative stance to China and India's challenges to regulate stem cell experimentation. Despite these differences, the analysis of the three countries reveals five common elements needed for stem cell development - a critical mass of highly trained people, sustained government support, strong linkages between stake-holders, sufficient infrastructure, and comprehensive regulations. I also compare the strategies that have helped or hindered each country to develop these elements. They include strategies to boost human capacity (such as the Chinese program to recruit nationals working abroad), permissive but clear embryonic stem cell regulations, and building centres of excellence to focus on particular stem cell research goals, among others. This thesis not only demonstrated that there is significant innovative research occurring in the emerging economies, it also shows the importance of using a systemic perspective to look at RM. Linkages between all RM actors are important, and R&D is divided across firms, universities, research centres and hospitals. My perspective of RM development would have been severely hindered had I studied only centres providing therapy, only institutions conducting clinical trials, or only universities conducting basic research. Demand for RM helps the development of accessible, affordable and appropriate RM therapies, so communication with end users can help shape RM development. Some of the findings of this comparative analysis are not necessarily new or unexpected. For example, it is not new that academic institutions may be involved in the research behind new technologies and the transfer of technology to firms is of the utmost importance to translation. Yes, brain drain effects hamper the ability of developing countries to retain their best and brightest, and educational reforms may be important to the development of future skilled 242 scientists. Although these observations may not be groundbreaking, it is hoped that their analysis here will add greater depth and clarity to how all of these issues interact to form the innovative structure in which new technologies either gain momentum or sputter out. It also indicates specific strategies that some countries have used to overcome or circumvent such challenges, which may be of use to other countries interested in pursuing high-tech health strategies. Other conclusions presented in this thesis are novel and may challenge our understanding of technological change and innovation in developing countries. For example, this thesis challenges our current understanding of innovation in developing countries by showing that RM innovation follows a process not adequately defined yet in the innovation systems literature. Most developing country innovation describes a reverse engineering process, whereas RM is an emerging technology for which products are not yet available and so cannot be reverse engineered. The emerging economies use instead a mix of strategies to innovate in this new field including new to the world innovation; more research is needed to describe southern innovation in a way that captures these. Clustering of RM may help build capacity in RM but could impact access to future RM therapies and services, showing the potential for both positive and negative impacts. RM may fulfill local demand for much needed therapeutic alternatives - simultaneously stimulating the economy by reducing health costs, increasing productive workers, and increasing scientific capacity and infrastructure - but if these therapies are locked into major city centres and are only affordable to the higher-income demographics, they may further entrench socio-economic and health disparities. 243 9.4 Limitations and opportunities for further study This study is broad in nature and should be seen as a first step that depicts the early development of an emerging technology, opening the door for more targeted hypothesis testing research and theory development. It studies RM while it is in an early stage (both globally and locally), which allows me to explore early decision making in the field and challenges to initial capacity building. However, it may be too early to understand other topics such as firm decision-making, marketing strategies and performance, which should be further explored when the technologies are more mature. This study is tied to this specific time and these studied places, and while it suggests ideas that may be relevant on a larger scale, these suggestions need to be tested for their relevance to any new environment. Many of the observations and strategies presented within this manuscript are contextually specific, resulting from specific historical, cultural, political and/or geographical milieu, or are specific to the technology to which they speak. Strategies that have worked for the countries in this study cannot be necessarily replicated in others - their relevance to their new culture and setting must first be explored. For example, while China's permissive human embryonic stem cell research regulations have spurred innovation in China, I by no means suggest that Brazil or other countries adopt these same regulations where they are not in accordance with local cultural values. Whereas linkages with and support for cord blood banks may be important in India where these organizations are engaging in research, these intuitions play less of a role in Brazil, where emphasizing links between researchers and industry may be more strategic for RM development. Each system has unique components, strengths and challenges; this study simply presents a good place to start, and identifies elements that are likely important. More work on developing country innovation is critical, particularly in unexplored 244 areas such as high-tech innovation, and research should explore fields with high local demand, such as health-related fields. 9.5 Catching up or getting ahead? In chapter two, I argue that innovation systems literature related to developing countries has focused too heavily on \"catching-up\" and has neglected emerging high-tech fields in which developing countries may have a realistic chance of developing and maintaining a head start. This thesis demonstrates that innovation in high-tech fields such as RM is not only possible, it is already happening. While the RM fields of Brazil and India remain small, they are well on their way to establishing new products, and have already made important contributions to the field. China has developed a very productive stem cell research program, with increasing yearly publication levels challenging all but the United States. This research indicates the need now for a shift in our language and attitude about developing country innovation, recognizing the potential of maintaining leads in at least some advanced areas or fields. While it may be necessary for long-term development for developing countries to have a role in technological development - not from a back seat or catch up position, but by innovating right along side with the best of them - I do acknowledge the difficulties of maintaining this parity when the resources and infrastructure available are substantially less and the culture and institutions are not supportive or fully developed. These real-world challenges limit all but the wealthiest developing countries from engaging in new high-tech fields - and as we see from the regional discrepancies in capacity discussed in Chapter 8, RM is not even something that these countries can do uniformly. Without sufficient critical mass, efforts to invest in RM may be exceedingly costly with little return. But for those regions and countries that have already 245 accumulated the critical mass of infrastructure and expertise, fields like RM may be situated in a sweet spot that allow competitive advantage to these countries who can build RM expertise while the field is young. Success for RM may be determined by continued government support. The impetus for Brazil, China and India to invest in RM has been local demand for new health products and services that are desperately needed by a growing demographic of the population. Unlike most demand-based products, RM is funded principally by public dollars, due to the lack of venture capital and private funds for long-term and high-risk development. Private funding may also be lacking because stem cells as of yet do not follow a typical drug commercialization pathway, and cures based on one-to-one surgical transplantation are not a profitable model for the pharmaceutical industry. In the long-term, sustainability of RM may require greater involvement from the private sector, but until market forces can drive greater investment, the public health benefits and economic benefits may be sufficient to drive continued government support. High-tech fields like RM require long-term commitments and returns are far from certain. In order to maximize their chances of success, the governments of Brazil, China and India must begin to address the challenges to RM in their countries. For example, China will need to fully implement its new clinical regulations before the international community supports its stem cell program. Brazil's president Dilma Rousseff just announced an unexpected 23% cut to Brazil's 2011 science budget - not a move that will support RM researchers who already complain of inconsistent and short-term financing. According to media reports, India has set up a committee of stem cell experts to evaluate stem cell clinical trials which will meet for the first time on March 9th, 2011, and new regulations governing the clinical use of stem cell are likely to be passed this year (IndiaExpress.com 2010; Bose and Mathew 2011). The RM sectors of Brazil, 246 China and India are still largely under development; how this field develops will depend not only on technical innovation but also largely on regulatory and funding decisions. The governments have been instrumental to the development of stem cell therapies, and their continued support is essential if RM therapies are going to make it to market, and will determine if these therapies reach those who need them most. If indeed a case is to be made that developing countries can get ahead and stay ahead, this thesis shows that investments in RM may be a good choice. RM could help treat a growing epidemic of chronic disease in developing countries. These treatments could be economically significant - the forgone national income due to heart disease, stroke and diabetes is estimated at US$2.7, US$18.3 and US$8.7 billion for Brazil, China and India, respectively in 2005, and rising yearly (World Health Organization 2005). All three countries are interested in moving towards a knowledge-based economy, and development of new high-tech science and technology programs are part of that strategy. The multi-disciplinary nature of RM may help build infrastructure that will be important to multiple fields of biology and medicine even if any particular RM technology fails. The stem cell fields of Brazil, China and India are still very much in development, but as I show here, these countries have a real chance to stay ahead in RM and ensure that their local populations have access to accessible, affordable, appropriate RM treatments that are desperately needed globally. 9.6 References Bose, P. and Mathew, J.

Our research on regenerative medicine within China is part of a larger research project which will investigate regenerative medicine capabilities within emerging economies such as India, China, and Brazil. We aim to identify lessons and models in regenerative medicine research that can be used to encourage local capacity building and applied to low and middle income countries, ultimately improving global health. 249 We have previously performed a comparable study on Health Biotechnology Innovation in Developing Countries. The study, published as a 2004 Nature Biotechnology Supplement, showed the potential for biotechnology to improve health in developing countries and emerging economies, and provided insights into how these countries are able to development local strengths in biotechnology innovation. (For more information on the study see http://www.utoronto.ca/jcb/home/news_nature.htm). We hope that this study can do the same for regenerative medicine.

For the purpose of this project we define regenerative medicine as an interdisciplinary field of research and clinical applications focused on the repair, replacement or regeneration of cells, tissues or organs to restore impaired function resulting from any cause, including congenital defects, disease, trauma and aging. It uses a combination of several converging technological approaches, both existing and newly emerging, that moves it beyond traditional transplantation and replacement therapies. The approaches often stimulate and support the body's own self-healing capacity. These approaches may include, but are not limited to, the use of soluble molecules, gene therapy, stem cell transplantation, tissue engineering, and the reprogramming of cell and tissue types. 250 Sincerely, [Halla name/address for China interviews] Dominique McMahon, B.Sc.
