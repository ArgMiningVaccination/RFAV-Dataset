As a result, essential oils were banned from that school district: Due to the possibility of potentially life-threatening allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), the use of essential oils, aromatherapies, and diffusers will no longer be allowed in all of the Oakwood School District buildings. Essential oils, aromatherapies, and diffuser scents affect individuals differently, and may be a trigger (allergen) when breathing it in or exposure to the skin for those students and staff with allergies and asthma. Students and staff with asthma and allergies are also at increased risk for life-threatening allergic reactions (anaphylaxis). Our aim is to provide safe indoor air quality, free of potential allergens for students and staff with allergies and asthma.

Chemicals in lavender and tea tree oil appear to be hormone disruptors \"From the hundreds of chemicals that comprise lavender and tea tree oil, they selected for analysis eight components that are common and mandated for inclusion in the oils. Four of the tested chemicals appear in both oils: eucalyptol, 4-terpineol, dipentene/limonene and alpha-terpineol. linalyl acetate, linalool, alpha-terpinene and gamma-terpinene. Using in vitro, or test tube, experiments, the researchers applied these chemicals to human cancer cells to measure changes of estrogen receptor- and androgen receptor-target genes and transcriptional activity. All eight chemicals demonstrated varying estrogenic and/or anti-androgenic properties, with some showing high or little to no activity, the investigators reported. Ramsey said these changes were consistent with endogenous, or bodily, hormonal conditions that stimulate gynecomastia in prepubescent boys. \"Lavender oil and tea tree oil pose potential environmental health concerns and should be investigated further,\" he said. Of further concern, according to Ramsey, is that many of the chemicals they tested appear in at least 65 other essential oils. Essential oils are available without a prescription and are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Thus, the public should be aware of these findings and consider all evidence before deciding to use essential oils.\" [https://www.endocrine.org/news-room/2018/chemicals-in-lavender-and-tea-tree-oil-appear-to-be-hormone-disruptors](https://www.endocrine.org/news-room/2018/chemicals-in-lavender-and-tea-tree-oil-appear-to-be-hormone-disruptors) ... ...

These natural compounds are essential oils.\" ... ... ...\"The European Union is now considering labeling lavender, \"May Be Harmful if Inhaled.\" More specifically, a lavender allergy is caused by a compound within lavender extract called linalool. Linalool produces lavender's fragrance and reacts with air to form the skin irritant. The natural extract of a lavender plant contains 20 to 40 percent linalool, depending on the plant variety, and chemists can synthesize linalool at a purity of 97 percent. The more people use natural products, the more likely they are to develop an allergy to them, since reactions often occur with regular contact. These types of allergens are called sensitizers. \"People often think that when they become allergic to some thing it has to be something new,\" says Dr. Michael Stierstoffer, a dermatologist practicing in the Philadelphia area. \"But often it's something that they have been repetitively exposed to and then at some point in time the immune system just decides to become allergic to it.\" Some types of allergies induce hay fever and asthma as the immune system dumps histamine and other inflammatory response chemicals into the blood stream in response to the allergen. A Type 1 allergy, as it is known, can be fatal if the inflammation is so severe that the airway swells to the point of closing (called anaphylaxis). A less extreme allergy (Type 4) occurs when lymph nodes absorb an allergen and tag it as suspicious. Continued exposure assures the immune system of the allergen's ill will and, eventually, contact with the allergen results in a scaly rash. Both types of allergies can exhibit this sensitization lag time, though it's more common with Type 4.\" ...
