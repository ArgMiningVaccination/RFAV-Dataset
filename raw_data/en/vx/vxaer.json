But experts have advised the WHO to be cautious. The Solidarity Vaccines Trial Expert Group warned: 'Deployment of a weakly effective vaccine could actually worsen the Covid-19 pandemic if authorities wrongly assume it causes a substantial reduction in risk, or if vaccinated individuals wrongly believe they are immune.' They recommend that a vaccine should at least be 50 per cent effective to be approved. Oxford University epidemiologist Professor Sir Richard Peto added that rushing to approve a vaccine could set a poor benchmark for future vaccines. He told The Guardian: 'I think there's a big rush, a somewhat nationalistic rush and also somewhat capitalistic rush as well, to be absolutely first to register a vaccine, and it will actually make it more difficult to evaluate other vaccines. 'We do need a vaccine that works and we need it soon.' But he cautioned: 'We really do need quite strong evidence of efficacy.'
