This COVID-19 continues to spread and poses serious threats to public health throughout the world. Even though vaccines are available, there is no guarantee of critical population vaccination, as there still exist stiff resistance to the uptake of the currently available vaccines. Purpose: To assess nurses' perceptions regarding the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines, determine the proportion of nurses vaccinated, as well as the associated factors influencing the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines, so as to alert decision makers on the possible limitations associated with the uptake of the vaccines in the nursing population in Fako Division, Cameroon. Methods: This was a mixed method quantitative and qualitative study conducted in Fako Division. A multistage random sampling technique was employed to enroll participants into the study. We collected quantitative data from consented nurses through the use of a structured questionnaire from April 06th to June 2nd, 2022, and qualitative data from nurse leaders through focused-group discussion from June 3rd to 23rd, 2022. In the quantitative phase, we performed descriptive and inferential statistics using the SPSS Version 23.0 and in the qualitative phase, we performed a thematic content analyses and transcription. Results: In the quantitative phase, we had more females 131(66.5%), and nurses aged 26-40years 90(45.7%). Most nurses worked in the maternity 49(24.9%). In the qualitative phase, 20(76.9%) were females. Regarding nurses perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines uptake, 133(67.5%) nurses had positive perceptions, and 26(07.6%) had \"No trust\" in the vaccines. Most nurses 109(55.3%) had not been vaccinated. Negative factors reported by nurses included the belief that the vaccines were dangerous and could cause death 120(60.9%) and 32(16.2%) said no one can influence them to change their minds about taking the vaccines. In the qualitative phase, a majority of the nurse leaders 15(57.7%) wished that COVID-19 vaccination should continue, but with accompanying research to eliminate side effects. It was observed that a majority of the nurse leaders 16(61.5%) had been vaccinated. The respondents reported some factors (belief factors, social influence and lack of knowledge), which had negatively influenced them from taking the COVID-19 vaccines. Conclusion: Nurses perceived high relevance for the COVID-19 vaccines while a majority of the nurse leaders perceived that the COVID-19 vaccines are not safe, ineffective with numerous side effects, has a magnetic effect, politically motivated with bad faith, and has the possibility to cause infections. Furthermore, most nurses had not been vaccinated, but a majority of nurse leaders were reported to have taken a COVID-19 vaccine. Several negative factors including belief, social influence and religious factors were reported to have contributed to the lower uptake of the COVID-19 vaccines amongst nurses and nurse leaders in Fako division, Cameroon.

The COVID-19 viral disease is amongst the deadliest infectious diseases to have emerged in recent history. As with all past pandemics, the specific mechanisms of its emergence in humans remains unknown [1]. This virus belongs to the B-coronavirus group, the same group of the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and for the similarity, it was named SARS-CoV-2 [2]. Genomic analysis suggests that, the COVID-19 virus originated in bats and was transmitted to humans through an unknown intermediate hosts in Wuhan, China. According to WHO [3], the COVID-19 disease affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalization. However, serious symptoms such as breathing difficulty or shortness of breath, loss of speech or mobility, confusion and chest pain posed serious risk to the patient. Since its discovery, more than 2,850,000 cases have been reported, including nearly 200,000 deaths [4, 5] Globally, the covid-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread and poses serious threats to public health and economic stability throughout the world. Thus, to protect the global population, developing safe, effective and acceptable vaccines is mandatory to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [6]. The development of vaccines is considered among the greatest scientific achievements in promoting global health [7], with vaccination programs decreasing the burden of infectious diseases, loss of life, and contributing to strengthening the health system as a whole. However, reaping such benefits depends upon a willingness of the population to be vaccinated [8]. Even as vaccines are available, Omer et al., [9] realized that the availability of vaccines does not guarantee sufficient population vaccination as evidenced by vaccine hesitancy which stems from multiple key factors including; complacency (the .

More so, previous research had proven that vaccine uptake remains variable and inconsistent, and successful inoculation against this disease will require widespread public educational campaigns regarding vaccine safety and efficacy [11]. Dror [11] in his 2020 study argued that, people who were currently vaccinated against seasonal influenza had a strong tendency to accept a future COVID-19 vaccine, but Healthcare Worker's (HCWs') perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines uptake in his study was intriguing. The rate of acceptance for a COVID-19 vaccine among physicians and nurses overall was lower than their acceptance rates of seasonal influenza vaccination. Other studies regret that voluntary vaccination had been sub-optimal among HCWs in the United States, a priority group for whom immunization is essential for maintaining health system capacity and the safety of high-risk patients in their care [12]. Africa is no exception. In the context of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a study of 613 HCWs, including 50.9% men and 49.1% women revealed that, only 27.7% of the HCWs said that they would accept a COVID-19 vaccine if it was available. In this entire population, up to 72.8% of the HCWs were nurses which was a significant predictor to consider [13]. Considering other schorlarly works conducted in Nigeria, many HCW workers demonstrated unwillingness for the COVID-19 vaccines; a major setback to attain full immunization coverage among HCWs. However, knowledgeable HCWs with high motivation and high willingness reported a 15-times higher odds ratio of being fully vaccinated and by comparison, motivation relatively contributed to their high uptake of COVID-19 vaccines. Much of the recent literature coming out of Nigeria and other low-middle-income countries (LMICs) focused on increasing motivation as a factor to get a COVID-19 vaccination [10]. In a Cameroonian study by Dinga et al., [14], vaccine hesitancy to a COVID-19 vaccine was 84.6% of 2512 respondents. Reasons for vaccine hesitancy using the WHO matrix of vaccines hesitancy .

Most Cameroonians raised concerns of safety, efficacy and confidence. Among 371 healthcare workers who took part in another study, only 45.38% indicated willingness to accept the vaccine if offered [15]. However, eradicating the COVID-19 disease and ensuring patients safety in the hands of the HCWs, will require a safe vaccine which is first acceptable by nurses since they are the frontline care provider. In doing so, it is imperative to appraise the proportion of nurses and nurse leaders vaccinated with a COVID- 19 vaccine, their perceptions about the vaccines and factors associated with COVID-19 vaccines' uptake in the context of Fako Division, Cameroon. Materials and Methods Study design In this study, a Mixed Method Research (MMR) of qualitative and quantitative design was employed, from october 2021 through July 2022. A cross-sectional survey was used in the quantitative research design to describe the overall picture of a phenomenon at a given point in time, and data was collected with the use of a structured questionnaire. On the otherhand, focused-group discussion was employed for the qualitative aspect of the research. Study population The sample population included all nurses (quantitative phase) and nurse leaders (qualitative phase), working in the Tiko District Hospital (TDH), Buea Regional Hospital (BRH) and the Limbe Regional Hospital (LRH) in Fako Division, Cameroon.

These persons are charged with the general supervision of the hospital, management of units and the coordination of COVID-19 vaccination program. Nurse leaders who consented and were available to participate in the study were enrolled. For the quantitative phase, ward nurses working in the selected facilities that were available during data collection and consented to take part in the study were recruited. However, we excluded nurses and nurse leaders in the selected facilities who gave their consent to be part of the study but were sick of COVID- 19 or other major bed-bound illnesses at the time of data collection. A sample size of 203 nurses for the quantitative phase was calculated based on the formula proposed by Cochran (1963:75) [16]. However, the finite sample size calculation was done for the various selected facilities in the different health district in Fako Division, using the probability proportionate to sample size sampling method (Tab 1). This produced separate sample sizes for the different health facilities. A total of 27 nurse leaders were recruited for the qualitative study in the three hospital facilities. Three separate Focused-Group Discussions (FGDs) was conducted for the three different hospitals. Each FGDs had one (1) or two (2) general supervisors, seven (7) Unit Heads, and one (1) coordinator in charge of COVID-19 vaccination. General supervisors in each facility served as moderators during the discussion. .

A majority of the nurses 90(45.7%) were aged 26-40years, followed by those 18-25years 67(34.0%). Single nurses constituted the majority 101(51.3%), followed by those married 67(34.0%). Most nurses were working in the maternity 49(24.9%), medical 33(16.8%) and surgical 30 (15.2%) units and a large proportion 89(45.2%) of the nurses had worked for between 5-10years In the qualitative phase, females 20(79.92%) were by far more than males 06(23.08%). A majority of the nurses 18(69.23%) were aged 26-40years, followed by those aged >50years 05(23.08%). Regarding their level of training, a majority held a bachelor's degree 12(46.15%) and most of our respondents were working at the COVID-19 vaccination/maternity/ANC units 07(26.93%).

In a similar study conducted in Philadelphia, United States (US) [17], 63.7% of employees reported that they planned and would want to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, 26.3% were unsure, and 10.0% did not plan to be vaccinated. In another study conducted in Saudi Arabia, it was observed that 50.5% were willing to have the COVID- 19 vaccine with up to 49.7% intending to take the vaccine as soon as it became available in the country, while 50.3% indicated they would delay until the vaccine's safety was confirmed [18]. Since the COVID- 19 disease was new to every nation, its perceieved threat and severity in Cameroon, the USA and Saudi Arabia between 2020 to 2022 was devasting. Consequently, individuals were expected to consider the benefits of taking the vaccines rather than envisaging the risk(s) involved with vaccine uptake. In contrast, a study conducted in the South West Region (SWR) of Cameroon revealed that the positivity rate of COVID-19 dropped from 17.7% in December 2021 to 4.1% in January 2022 [19]. This finding is in contrast with our results probably because of the declining transmission of COVID-19 in the SWR in 2022. Consequently, residents did not see the need to take the vaccine. Even with nurses' willingness for a COVID-19 vaccine, they had negative perceptions regarding its uptake. Majority reported; no trust in the ingredients & pharmaceutical companies 26(07.6%); vaccines could not be safe, ineffective and the presents of dangerous side effects 24(25.9%); and could cause COVID-19 infection 07(6.6%). This is similar to [20], where several nurses had negative perceptions regarding the uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine. Measure reasons were skepticism and side effects (36%); 20.0% preferred using few medications to prevent themselves; 19% preferred gaining natural immunity, .

Moreover, others indicated that they were afraid of needle pain during vaccination (7/38), percieved ineffectiveness of the vaccines (7/38=18.42%), perceived low severity (5/38=13.16%) and distrust of government sources (5/38=13.16%)[21]. Consequently, nurses were considered to have understood that no medication or vaccines exist without side effects. However, the preventive purpose had always been greater. Proportion of nurses vaccinated against COVID-19 In this study, only 88 (44.7%) of nurses in the quantitative phase had taken a COVID-19 vaccine. Similar to a report by the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Cameroon and WHO [19], only 1,812 doses of COVID-19 vaccines per 100,000 inhabitants, had been administered, representing 1.2% of the target population in Cameroon. The Ministry of Health (MoH) attributed the low vaccination rate to be associated with a small number of health staff administering vaccines, and the reluctance of the population to get vaccinated including HCWs. In the South West Region (SWR), where this study was conducted, the vaccination coverage remained low at 1.8% [19]. This low uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine by the population would have been ameliorated when nurses began to take the vaccines as frontline care givers and lead by example. In contrast to other studies, 32,903,329 people in South Africa (SA) had received 1 or more dose of a COVID-19 vaccine dose, giving the prevalence at 62.9% [22]. This sharp contrast could have possibly occurred due to the perceived benefits of being vaccinated and as a cue to action against the omicron BA.4 and BA.5 variant in April 2022, that increased the rate of infection in SA from 300 infections to 8.000 per week. Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccines uptake among nurses/nurse leaders In this study, a majority of nurses and nurse leaders had the belief that the COVID-19 vaccines were dangerous and could result to killing someone 120 (60.9%). In a similar study among HCWs who refused vaccination, reported fear of side effects 67(93%), and the belief that the development time of the vaccines .

Respondents in another study had the belief that the COVID-19 vaccines lack research and are risky (37.0%). Moreover, beliefs about rushed vaccine development, was the principal fact sorted and this alone could cause tremendous disaster to the population [24]. We realized that emergency vaccines were needed because of the insurgency of the COVID-19 disease, as such, every belief system would not have really been overemphasized as there was a great need for people to be safe through vaccination in every part of the world. There was no study within our search, published or unpublished, to contradict these findings. Social influence was poorly reported. Up to 157 (79.7%) of our nurses could not be influenced by the government to take the vaccines. Findings from a similar study in Canada revealed mistrust towards governments and public health bodies (including mentors) on COVID-19 vaccines uptake [25; 26]. This could have been due to perceived political unwillingness to approve other treatment options like the Samuel Kleda's COVID-19 complementary medicine in Cameroon. In contrast, Grumbach et al., [27] in their San Francisco study revealed up to 87.5% of HCWs who had trust in what the authorities were saying regarding the uptake of COVID-19 vaccine. The authorities in San Francisco could have revealed their COVID-19 infection status, toke the COVID-19 jab in public space and asssured the population with a strong will to respond to any eventuality if any one gets sick due to the vaccines. This was likely not the case in Cameroon. Regarding knowledge factor, nurses with either correct or incorrect knowledge about COVID-19 vaccine (115 (58.4%), did not agree to take the vaccines. According to a similar study [28], Up to 78% of HCWs reported that 'not knowing enough about the vaccine' was a barrier to vaccination. Not enough information (73%) was cited as reason for vaccine refusal [29] and others reported a lack of understanding about the vaccine containing live or attenuated virus [26]. Not knowing about COVID-19 vaccines and its potency can greatly infuence the nurse not to take the vaccines. In cameroon, being knowledgeable or not as a .

This was because, nurses had possibly not understood the motive for the sudden pressure of all frontline care-givers in Cameroon to take a COVID- 19 vaccine when other measures than vaccination proved to have saved more lives. Conclusion Nurses perceived high relevance for the COVID-19 vaccines 133(67.51%) while a majority of the nurse leaders perceived that the COVID-19 vaccines were; ineffective with dangerous side effects; no trust in the ingredients and pharmaceutical industries; and the vaccines could have the possibility of causing COVID-19 infection. Even with the negative perceptions, most nurses and nurse leaders were still willing to take the vaccines once they understood its benefits and its side effects. A significant proportion of nurses in Fako Division, had not yet been vaccinated against COVID-19. However, a majority of nurse leaders (unit heads, GS and COVID-19 vaccination unit coordinators) had been vaccinated with one or two of the currently available COVID-19 vaccines. Negative factors that influenced COVID-19 vaccines uptake by nurses and nurse leaders in Fako division, included the belief that the vaccines were dangerous and could cause death. There were also religious and social factors reported, which could be addressed if we must increase COVID-19 vaccination uptake and deal with the multi-faceted impact of COVID-19 infection in Fako Division.
