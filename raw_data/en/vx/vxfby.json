The dynamic SEC analysis for RO process was largely dependent on the feed pressure, reported at 50 kWh/m3 at feed pressure of 0.9 MPa with less than 50% water removal. The occurrence of foaming at above 50% water removal caused discrepancies between the simulated flux results and the experimentally acquired results in RO, whereas the estimated dynamic SEC for MD process did not show a strong correlation with the temperatures selected in this study, ranging from 900 to 1000 kWh/m3.

Introduction [1](#B1-membranes-11-00673)]. The demand for TCM mass production with consistent quality from each batch production is growing, thriving the modernization of TCM production process. [2](#B2-membranes-11-00673)]. Alternatives for the concentration process is highly demanded across fingerprints analysis of the extracts before and after the concentration process, and the retention of bioactive components concentrated by MD is higher than 99% [ [11](#B11-membranes-11-00673)]. RO and MD processes demonstrate feasible approaches to maintaining the chemical integrity of the TCM extracts. [12](#B12-membranes-11-00673), [13](#B13-membranes-11-00673)]. The osmotic pressure difference originates from the chemical potential gradient across the membrane [ [14](#B14-membranes-11-00673), [15](#B15-membranes-11-00673)]. As the concentration process proceeds, the elevated concentration on the feed side will further enhance the disparity of chemical potential across the membrane, resulting in a higher osmotic pressure difference. The concentration process will halt if the input pressure fails to counteract the increasing retarding force on the feed side caused by the osmotic pressure [ [12](#B12-membranes-11-00673), [13](#B13-membranes-11-00673), [15](#B15-membranes-11-00673)]. [16](#B16-membranes-11-00673)]. The temperature elevation required to drive the MD process is considerably lower than that for evaporation, and this moderate heating can be achieved with low-grade thermal energy sources. Owing to this special feature of MD, it is generally considered to be a more suitable option for the treatment of highly concentrated feed than the lack of fundamental data and scientific information available for the thermophysical property changes of the extracts during the water removal process, the estimation of energy consumptions of these processes is rarely noticed. Nevertheless, the importance of the thermophysical properties (i.e., density, viscosity, thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity) was identified in a study by Dong et al. in the modelling of membrane distillation for desalination application. It was realized that the changes in these properties can be significant as compared to the desalination of seawater, suggested in a study in the rheology behavior of fruit juice concentrate [ [20](#B20-membranes-11-00673)]. These properties are critical in determining the hydrodynamic environment of the feed solutions, implying their prominent impact on heat and mass transfer, and the subsequent energy consumption can be significant in the concentration process of plant extracts [ [21](#B21-membranes-11-00673)]. [22](#B22-membranes-11-00673)]. This can be viewed as the simplest form of grey-box modelling estimation, enabling the integration of well-developed models of heat and mass transfer as a white box part, as well as the empirical correlations of certain essential properties as the black box part required in the energy evaluation [ [23](#B23-membranes-11-00673)]. [24](#B24-membranes-11-00673)]. [1](#B1-membranes-11-00673), [25](#B25-membranes-11-00673), [26](#B26-membranes-11-00673)]. In 2003, YPFS was one of the defensive medicines used in China for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and it is generally viewed as a prevention approach to pneumonia that tonifies a weak immune system [ [1](#B1-membranes-11-00673)]. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Preparation of Yu-Ping-Feng-San Solution [27](#B27-membranes-11-00673), [28](#B28-membranes-11-00673)]. A microfiltration pre-treatment process by a 0.2 m ceramic membrane (Jiangsu Jiuwu Hi-Tech Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China) was conducted afterwards to obtain a total of 5 L of clarified YPFS solution. 2.2. Reverse Osmosis Experiment 2.2.1. Materials 2.2.2. Experimental [Figure 1](#membranes-11-00673-f001), enabling automatic monitoring and recording of each parameter. Operating pressures for the inlet and outlet of the feed side in membrane element were measured by pressure transducers, denoted as P in [Figure 1](#membranes-11-00673-f001), (HCP106_H_18_I_14_B_T, Qingdao Huacheng Measurement and Control Equipment Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), and flowrates were recorded by flowmeters, denoted as F in [Figure 1](#membranes-11-00673-f001)(KEYENCE, FD-010C) for feed and permeate streams. [29](#B29-membranes-11-00673)]. The operating frequency of the pump (Hydra-cell, SUS316) was maintained at 35Hz throughout the study, providing a constant feed flowrate of 6.87 L/min. The operating pressure was controlled by the pressure control valve of V-2 (shown in [Figure 1](#membranes-11-00673-f001)), with feed solution recirculating at full capacity back to the feed tank via V-1. Valves for discharge streams (V-3 and V-4) were closed during the experiments. 2.3. Membrane Distillation Experiment 2.3.1. Materials 2.3.2. Experimental Protocol [Figure 2](#membranes-11-00673-f002). The feed and permeate streams circulated at a flowrate of 0.20 L/min in counter-flow direction by gear pumps (WT3000-1JA, Longer Precision Pump Co., Ltd., Baoding, China). Transducers of temperature (CWDZ11, Beijing Star Sensor Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) and pressure (CYYZ11, Beijing Star Sensor Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China), as well as flowmeter (GTGF04F1M2B, Anhui Jujie Automation Technology Co., Ltd., Wuhu, China), were installed along the streams, with measurements automatically recorded in the connected computer. [30](#B30-membranes-11-00673), [31](#B31-membranes-11-00673)]. It was confirmed in a previous study that MD operation at 60 \u00b0C was able to generate a concentrate with a total similarity rate of 99.5% with the original TCM extract [ [11](#B11-membranes-11-00673)]. Experiments were terminated when the remaining volume of feed solution was reduced to less than 200 mL. [Figure 2](#membranes-11-00673-f002). Samples were regularly taken from the concentrated stream for \u00b0Brix measurements. The time interval of automatic data collection was set at 60 s in the MD experiments. The conductivity of the permeate was monitored by a portable conductivity meter (CT-20 m, Shanghai Lichen Bangxi Instrument Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) throughout the experiment, providing an effective alert and precaution for membrane wetting. 2.4. Mathematical Model and Numerical Analysis of Energy Consumption [22](#B22-membranes-11-00673)]. The incorporation of these empirical property correlations (as shown in [Table S1](#app1-membranes-11-00673)) allowed the simulation to reveal the varying dynamics during the concentration process. This approach can be viewed as an early attempt of the grey box modelling application in membrane-based concentration processes for TCM manufacturing and other herbal plant extracts, facilitating data-driven optimization and the application of advanced algorithms for the design and control operations of membrane-based concentration processes in the future. 2.4.1. Energy Evaluation of RO Process [Figure S5](#app1-membranes-11-00673). The simulation is governed by the sorption-diffusion (S-D) model [ [32](#B32-membranes-11-00673)], and the energy equations derive from the engineering calculations of the pumping power requirement for incompressible fluid [ [33](#B33-membranes-11-00673)]. The numerical evaluation of energy consumption was achieved by a loop calculation to simulate the process dynamics on top of the relationships among feed concentration, osmotic pressure and permeate flux as described below. [22](#B22-membranes-11-00673)]. [34](#B34-membranes-11-00673), [35](#B35-membranes-11-00673)]. This estimated energy is defined as the thermodynamic minimum energy threshold for the RO process to occur, regardless of the system design and operations [ [36](#B36-membranes-11-00673)]. [36](#B36-membranes-11-00673)]. Therefore, the SEC that znormalizes the electrical energy consumption (i.e., pumping power) with permeate water production rate was applied in the performance analysis of the lab-scale RO process as shown in Equation (4) [ [37](#B37-membranes-11-00673), [38](#B38-membranes-11-00673), [39](#B39-membranes-11-00673)], [37](#B37-membranes-11-00673), [38](#B38-membranes-11-00673)]. The SEC analysis was evaluated using both the experimentally acquired and simulated permeate flowrate. 2.4.2. Energy Evaluation of MD Process [16](#B16-membranes-11-00673), [40](#B40-membranes-11-00673)]. The focus of the modelling SEC is the one-dimensional heat transfer from the feed to the permeate side in the membrane module, as indicated in Equation (5). [Figure S6](#app1-membranes-11-00673)in the supplementary information. The one-dimensional model only considers the energy transfer from the bulk feed region to the bulk permeate region via the membrane layer. The heat transfer rate computations for these regions are given of the studies in water desalination and brine treatment by MD employed constant thermophysical properties, since changes in these properties noticed in saline effluent is negligible. [Table S1](#app1-membranes-11-00673)) with \u00b0Brix into the numerical evaluations of energy consumption. 2.4.3. Saturated Vapor Pressure Correction Factor for YPFS Feed in MD Process [16](#B16-membranes-11-00673)]. The dynamic properties of the solution, such as viscosity and density, may contribute to the changes in the saturated vapor pressure on the feed side of the membrane. There have been attempts to correct the saturated vapor pressure of the feed solution by adjusting the water activity in a saline solution [ [40](#B40-membranes-11-00673), [42](#B42-membranes-11-00673), [43](#B43-membranes-11-00673)]. Yet, the aqueous system in YPFS herbal extract is far more complicated than that of the salt solution. Hence, in this study, a vapor correction factor was considered in the modelling to obtain better estimations of the dynamic permeate flux. [21](#B21-membranes-11-00673), [40](#B40-membranes-11-00673)]. The saturated vapor pressures of pure water were estimated by the Antoine equation for the corresponding temperature [ [44](#B44-membranes-11-00673)] as shown in Equation (19). Since wetting did not occur and only water vapor was removed during all tests, the value of vapor pressure on the permeate side was assumed to be identical with that of pure water () as below [ [44](#B44-membranes-11-00673)]: 2.4.4. Energy Evaluation of Thermal Evaporation Process [45](#B45-membranes-11-00673)]. The SEC can be derived from the steam ratio () by converting the steam quantity into the energy input of the evaporation system via Equation (20) [ [46](#B46-membranes-11-00673), [47](#B47-membranes-11-00673), [48](#B48-membranes-11-00673)]. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Concentration Process of YPFS by RO 3.1.1. Model Validation by Flux and \u00b0Brix [Figure 3](#membranes-11-00673-f003), most of the experimental measurements were in good agreement with the simulated permeate flux. Results showed most points from experimental data were within the 15% deviation band of the predicted flux value. However, it was observed that there were noticeable deviations towards the termination of experiment. These data were acquired experimentally in the test of 0.45, 0.6 and 0.9 MPa. The measured flux values were lower than the predicted value. This could be caused by the foaming in the YPFS extract in the feed tank. [Figure 4](#membranes-11-00673-f004). The \u00b0Brix profiles exhibited similar trend as the flux analysis in [Figure 3](#membranes-11-00673-f003). Most of the experimentally acquired \u00b0Brix measurements were in decent agreement with the simulated results, lying within the 15% deviation range. Conversely, discrepancies were observed in the tests of 0.6 MPa and 0.9 MPa at approximately 109 and 65 min. This corresponded to the observations of foaming as mentioned above. Foaming caused unanticipated flux reduction, consequently leading to a lower \u00b0Brix value than the simulated results with faster water removal rates. 3.1.2. Comparison of Feed Pressure and Osmotic Pressure at Termination [22](#B22-membranes-11-00673)]. [Figure 5](#membranes-11-00673-f005)a,b, during lower-pressure operations (0.3 and 0.45 MPa), it was observed that the osmotic pressure predicted via property correlation from experimental \u00b0Brix measurements gradually approached the feed pressure at the termination of experiment as previously predicted. The feed pressure profile recorded with pressure transducers in the test at 0.3 MPa was stable throughout the operation, while a slight decrease of feed pressure was detected from the readings at around 200 min in the test at 0.45 MPa. [49](#B49-membranes-11-00673), [50](#B50-membranes-11-00673), [51](#B51-membranes-11-00673), [52](#B52-membranes-11-00673)]. The extra agitations and the subsequent high shear rate in the high-pressure operation system further enhanced the bubble formation by introducing a gaseous phase to the process fluid. Foaming by saponins is frequently observed in plant extracts without the occurrence of degradation [ [50](#B50-membranes-11-00673), [53](#B53-membranes-11-00673)]. [Figure 5](#membranes-11-00673-f005)c,d. It is reasonable to assume a constant permeability in mass transfer simulation with negligible fouling in the RO tests concentrating YPFS herbal extracts, while foaming in the feed during RO process requires more in-depth study to unravel the effect on transport mechanism, in particular, herbal extracts related concentration process. 3.1.3. Energy Consumption Evaluation for RO [Figure S1](#app1-membranes-11-00673)), the thermodynamic minimum energy barrier for spontaneous RO processes at different operating pressures, regardless of system design, is shown in [Figure 6](#membranes-11-00673-f006). The results indicate that the theoretical energy requirements for YPFS concentration were considerably lower than seawater desalination, according to the literature data (1 for 50% water recovery from 32,000 ppm NaCl solution at ) [ [36](#B36-membranes-11-00673), [54](#B54-membranes-11-00673)]. [55](#B55-membranes-11-00673), [56](#B56-membranes-11-00673)]. It can be raised to above 6 MPa in the RO process with a recovery of about 50% [ [36](#B36-membranes-11-00673), [54](#B54-membranes-11-00673)]. Conversely, the osmotic pressure of YPFS extract will only reach around 1 MPa with 80% water removal (shown in [Figure S1](#app1-membranes-11-00673)), which significantly lowers the energy consumption in the RO concentration. [Figure 7](#membranes-11-00673-f007). The RO concentration experiments were operated at constant pump frequency with fixed pressure input. In an ideal case, the pumping power should remain constant throughout the RO concentration process [ [33](#B33-membranes-11-00673), [37](#B37-membranes-11-00673), [38](#B38-membranes-11-00673)]. However, in practice, both feed pressure and feed flowrate experienced significant drops in the later stage of the experiment due to the foaming phenomenon. The power estimation was impacted by the abnormal measurements taken by sensors that were disturbed by the foams, and the permeate flux analysis in [Section 3.1.1](#sec3dot1dot1-membranes-11-00673)indicated that the formation of foams could also contribute to the adverse impacts on water permeation. [Figure 7](#membranes-11-00673-f007), the model SEC at different feed pressures demonstrated similar trends in which the energy consumption increased mildly at the start and then underwent a steep rise at the threshold feed concentration (i.e., water removal). [Figure 8](#membranes-11-00673-f008). Despite that the actual pumping power input remained constant, the generated pressure and flowrate were impaired, and hence the computed results of the energy requirements via Equation (4) appeared to be aberrantly low, contributing to the departures of the experiment SEC from the model SEC. The deteriorated system performance led to extra reductions of permeate flux, which had a smaller degree of variation than those of the feed pressure and flowrate. Therefore, the changes in permeate flux (denominator) were less influential than the energy term (numerator) to the computation of experiment SEC. [49](#B49-membranes-11-00673)]. Process optimizations are necessary for zminimizing the adverse impact posed by foaming process of herbal extract concentration via pressure-driven membrane technology. [54](#B54-membranes-11-00673)]. This can be justified by the differences in the operational scale. A lab-scale RO system with an active membrane area was 0.4 was employed in this study, of which the active membrane area was 0.4 , resulting in extremely small water recoveries (less than 1%). Whereas, in RO desalination system, multiple membrane modules are installed in parallel or in a longitudinal direction with larger membrane area to achieve a higher permeate recovery (e.g., 50 % recovery from seawater with membrane area) [ [57](#B57-membranes-11-00673)]. [58](#B58-membranes-11-00673)]. The control of operating pressure for this system was achieved via the throttling valve, resulting in additional energy loss. 3.2. Concentration Process of YPFS by MD 3.2.1. Model Validation by Flux [Figure 9](#membranes-11-00673-f009). Most of the simulated data were within the 15% error range, which verified the feasibility of this model. Foaming in the YPFS feed solution was not observed during MD concentration. It may have been attributed to the lower feed flowrate applied in MD operation at 0.2 L/min than the flowrate of 6.87 L/min applied in RO operation. The condition of foaming formation should be thoroughly investigated in future studies. 3.2.2. Impact of Water Removal on the \u00b0Brix [Figure S4](#app1-membranes-11-00673), the \u00b0Brix estimation for an ideal case was not consistent with the measurements, since evaporation was inevitable in the system, although the feed was fully covered during the operation. Extra water loss should be taken into consideration in order to better fit the estimation curve to the measurement points, as shown in [Figure 10](#membranes-11-00673-f010). With the consideration of extra water loss due to evaporation, the simulated \u00b0Brix profile was closer to the actual measurement, where in this study was selected at 0.15 g/min. 3.2.3. Energy Consumption Evaluation for MD [Figure 11](#membranes-11-00673-f011), using both experimental and modelling calculation approaches. These energy estimations were validated by cross checking with literature data ( to ) from a published work on thermal analysis of DCMD system [ [59](#B59-membranes-11-00673)]. The results for results at the range of low water removal were within the approximated range of the reported data, while the was shown to be significantly below the range. [Figure 11](#membranes-11-00673-f011), the was higher than the . The only accounted for the heat transfer inside the membrane cell, whereas the considered the practical heat consumption in the feed stream during the MD process. Nevertheless, the comparison of with the specific cooling duty, shown in [Figure S4](#app1-membranes-11-00673), implied that the simulated heat transfer results were aligned with the energy intake by the permeate water stream of which the low-temperature state minimized the thermal disturbances from the surrounding environment. [59](#B59-membranes-11-00673)]. It is highly advised that the existing MD system should be improved and scaled up to obtain higher energy efficiency, facilitating future thermal analysis and evaluations. [Figure S4](#app1-membranes-11-00673), implied that the simulated heat transfer results were aligned with the energy intake by the permeate water stream of which the low-temperature state minimized the thermal disturbances from the surrounding environment. [Figure S2](#app1-membranes-11-00673)) at the later stage of the experiment. The flux reduction was more significant in the MD test, which could account for the steep rise in the corresponding . The flux reduction could be explained by the significant drop of the bulk feed temperature from initially to around towards the end of the experiment. 3.3. Numerical Evaluation of Energy Consumption for YPFS Concentration among RO, MD and Evaporation [Figure 12](#membranes-11-00673-f012). [6](#B6-membranes-11-00673), [60](#B60-membranes-11-00673)]. Nevertheless, the possibility of energy recovery by multi-stage MD and process optimization with the implementation of low-grade heat source as the energy input can make MD a more promising and sustainable concentration technology than thermal evaporation. Research and study in process optimization with multi-stage MD for the concentration of fruit juice and TCM is still unavailable to date. [54](#B54-membranes-11-00673)]. One of the mitigation measures has been applied to zdestabilize the foam in the solution via the addition of anti-foaming agents into the TCM solution. Conversely, it was observed that foaming was not obvious in MD operated at a mild feed flowrate. The condition of foaming is largely dependent on two factors, the concentration of surfactants and the sheer stress acting on the fluid. The mechanism of foaming in TCM extract concentration is yet to be studied. [21](#B21-membranes-11-00673)]. This varies significantly from each TCM prescription, requiring in-depth analysis in a case-by-case scenario. 4. Conclusions - 1. - Results generated from models developed in this study showed decent alignment with the experimentally acquired data; - 2. - The change in the properties of YPFS solution was characterized via the correlation with \u00b0Brix profile during concentration process. The changes in properties were integrated with the transport models. The approach proposed in this study can be easily modified and adapted for the concentration process of other natural plant extracts by membrane-based processes; - 3. - The model SEC was in close approximate to the experiment SEC for RO process at water removal rate of less than 50%. The SEC in this system in concentrating YPFS evaluated with higher values than the reported values in literature can largely be due to the low energy efficiency of a lab-scale module used in this work whereas Both the and were in close approximation to the reported SEC range for lab-scale DCMD system; - 4. - Severe foaming in the solution was observed during the concentration process by RO at high feed pressures. It may cause adverse effects on the driving force, particularly in the concentration of herbal extracts by RO processes; - 5. - A novel approach to estimate the saturated vapor pressure correction factor for herbal extract concentration was proposed, and the factor determined in YPFs solution was 0.95; - 6. - Insufficient heating resulted from the reduction of feed volume and retention time towards the later stage of concentration by MD process may cause a rapid decrease in flux and significant increase in dynamic SEC; - 7. - Evaluation via a cross-comparison among the three concecntration technologies confirmed that RO provided the best energy performance below a water removal of 77% in YPFS extract Supplementary Materials [https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/membranes11090673/s1](https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/membranes11090673/s1), Figure S1: The profile of osmotic pressure of YPFS extract solution with respect to water removal and water permeation with initial volume of 5 L, and initial concentration of 2 \u00b0Brix, Figure S2: Permeate flux measurements of membrane distillation (MD) process for different operating feed temperatures, Figure S3: Comparison of modelling SEC with the experimental specific cooling duty of the MD concentration processes, Figure S4: Comparison of simulated \u00b0Brix results obtained from two computation methods: (a) 50 \u00b0C; (b) 55 \u00b0C; Yu-Ping-Feng-San (YPFS) solution properties correlations, Table S2: Summary of MD membrane cell information, Table S3: Summary of vapor pressure correlation experiments for Yu-Ping-Feng-San (YPFS) MD process.
