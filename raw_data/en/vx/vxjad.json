The Congress will takeplace in association with a number of national and international organizations from North America and other continents. Consequently, the congress will provide the most comprehensiveglobal forum and perspective in the field of Complementary andIntegrative Medicine in 2017. The congress goal is reflected in its tag line: The Future of Compre- hensive Patient Care - Strengthening the Alliance of Researchers, Educa- tors and Providers . We believe that by bringing together researchers, educators and providers, who are addressing various aspects of Inte- grative Medicine and health, we can build on the evidence obtained through research to inform clinical education and practice andthereby create a better platform for comprehensive patient care.The main themes of the Congress are: 1.Clinical care : The practice of Integrative Medicine should be based on distinct definitions, should be informed by evidenceand evolve from guidelines that are developed by experts from conventional and complementary medicine. 2.Education : Academic leaders and health officials have called for future clinicians to possess the knowledge and skills to understand how Integrative Medicine can be incorporated into conventional care to improve the health of the public. Therefore, it is essential to share best practices in how tocreate robust curricular opportunities for medical students toexperience systematic teaching of the principles, strengths and limitations of Integrative Medicine. 3.Research : Within this Congress scientists will showcase the highest quality research worldwide in this field and will provide the state-of-the-science evidence base through plenary lec- tures, symposia and abstract presentations. 4.Traditional healing systems (THS) : Traditional healing practices and practitioners are an important and often underestimated part of health care. THS is found in almost every country in the world and the demand for its services is increasing. Research contributing to evidence informed decision making isimperative to develop a cohesive and integrative approach tohealth care that allows governments, health care practitioners and, most importantly, those who use health care services, to access THS in a safe, respectful, cost-efficient and effectivemanner. 5.Arts and medicine: For the first time at a research congress, this theme will explore the important contributions of the arts(music, visual arts, dancing, etc,) for integrative therapeuticinterventions to achieve optimal health and healing. Given the ambitious scope of this worldwide international congress,the four authors of the present editorial serve as co-presidents andthey are guided by the International Organizing Committee consist- ing of many experts from around the world including Myeong S. Lee, Jianping Liu, Kenji Watanabe (from Far East Asia), Renee Street (Af- rica), Amie. Steel (Australia), Paulo Arturo Caceres Guido, Chin An Lin(South America), Heather Boon, Josephine Briggs, John Weeks (NorthAmerica) and Abdullah Al-Bedah, Mohamed Khalil, Elad Schiff (Middle East and Israel). The programming for each of the five themes is directed by WCIMH 2017 theme subcommittees involving some of the most highly regarded clinicians, educators and researchers in the world in this field (in alphabetic order): Linda Balneaves, Lesley Braun, Eva Bojner Horwitz, Gustav Dobos, Jeffery Dusik, David Eisenberg, Iva Fattorini,Eckhart G. Hahn, Suzanne B. Hanser, Frederick Hecht, George M. Witt, Merlin Wilcox and Darong Wu. The Local Organizing Board is coordinated by M. Cree. We arevery grateful to all organisations and individuals working diligently tomaking this first World Congress for Integrative Medicine & Health in 2017 a great success. We are also pleased to announce that the opening welcome will in-clude the Director General for the World Health Organization, DrMargaret Chan (on video).

In addition, more than 400 posters will be presented in guided pos-ter sessions during the three days of the Congress.To translate the congress goals and objectives into a tangible action for the field, a Berlin Agreement is being developed. With the title 'Social and Self-responsibility in practicing and fostering Integrate Health and Medicine Globally, 'this document is meant to help shape the future of comprehensive patient care in Integrative Medicine, and addresses the responsibilities of all participants, including pa- tients and citizens, physicians and all colleagues working in thehealthcare system. The Berlin Agreement has been developed by theWCIMH 2017 congress presidents and the International Organizing Committee to create a document for further distribution to the scien- tific and clinical community and to health care stakeholders, decisionmakers, and politicians. We anticipate having the final version of theBerlin Agreement endorsed by a number of organizations prior to the Congress and also soliciting the support of congress at the WCIMH 2017 in Berlin. Our hope is that this document will providean important impetus for further engagement world-wide after theCongress has concluded. Immediately before the start of WCIMH 2017 on Wednesday May 3rd 2017 there will be several high-quality pre-conference workshopscovering all congress topics. Reflecting the political situation in re-cent years, especially in Europe, we have arranged for a unique half- day workshop on the topic: \"Refugees with Chronic Diseases between the Middle-East and Europe: The Role of Traditional and Integrative Medicine in Bridging Gaps \",The speakers are all from the Middle East and Europe and will address how Integrative Medicine may serve as an important element to overcome the problematic health situation of refugees around the world . We are convinced that the field of Complementary and IntegrativeMedicine, including traditional healing systems and medicine and the arts, will benefit from The 2017 World Congress on Integrative Medicine & Health \u2014a preeminent scientific international forum that is focused on highlighting advances in these thematic areas. We in-vite all practitioners, educators and researchers in the field of Integra- tive Medicine to come together, participate and engage together to make this Congress an exciting meeting for the successful advance-ment of Integrative Medicine across the globe. I2 The Berlin Agreement: Self-Responsibility and Social Action in Practicing and Fostering Integrative Medicine and Health GloballyApril 5, 2017BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): I2 IntroductionFaced by multiple challenges, including the rise of chronic, lifestylerelated diseases, and grossly inequitable access to healthcare, we are committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 to foster healthy lives and promote well-being for all ages. We are partof a global movement to orient care, and the education, researchand policy that support it, toward a model that draws on biomedical, complementary and traditional medicine practices and respects mul- tiple philosophies. This approach to medicine and healthcare:\"... reaffirms the importance of the relationship between practi- tioner and patient, focuses on the whole person, is informed by evi-dence, and makes use of all appropriate therapeutic and lifestyleapproaches, healthcare professionals and disciplines to achieve opti-mal health and healing. \" 1 Our work stands on that advanced in 1978 at the Alma-Ata Confer-ence that mobilized a movement for primary healthcare for all andofficially declared the importance of integration of effective trad-itional practices to promote global health. Today, the World Health Organization (WHO) advocates universal health coverage and inte- gration of safe and effective traditional providers and complemen-tary services into health service delivery, as well as self- carepractices. These are key objectives of the WHO 's traditional medicine strategy 2014-2023. We also affirm our alignment with the declara-tions from Beijing in 2008 and Stuttgart in 2016 and fully supportcalls on governments and non-governmental agencies to adopt, sup-port, fund, research and promote activities that advance evidence in- formed integrative care models. With this Berlin Agreement we call on ourselves as individuals to en-gage, to the best of our abilities, in the following:Model Health Recognizing that our ability to impart and enhance health and well- being is not only performed by a social and professional health prac-tice, but is also informed by our own self-care and resilience, westrive to model personal engagement in health-creating practices. Engage Patients Knowing that the most important strategy for fostering health is toengage patients in better lifestyle choices, we seek to develop ourskills to activate patients to be self-responsible, to strengthen their resilience, and become captains of their own healing processes. In respect for the importance of natural processes as guides for en-hancing well-being, we educate and stimulate patient understandingof, and participation in, efforts to protect and sustain the natural environment. Promote Interprofessionalism and Team CareKnowing that no single type of practitioner has all the answers thatcan be useful to a given patient, we individually seek to develop quality relationships with members of other disciplines and profes- sions to guarantee that we can quickly connect patients to the rightservices from the right practitioners and right professions at the righttime; Aware that such care may be provided via knowledge or practi- tioners from multiple global healing traditions, we personally committo continuously broadening our understanding, awareness and en-gagement with other fields and resources. Recognise the importance of traditional medicine in global healthcare Given that traditional medical products, practices and practitionersare the main access to healthcare in most regions of the world, wehighlight the importance of global investment to systematically de- velop best practices in these diverse systems that supports their safe and effective use and integration with biomedical practices.Commit to Evidence-Informed Dialogue and PracticeAware that a substantial portion of what is done in medicine and healthcare lacks a quality evidence base, we personally seek ever more effective ways to end polarizing dialogue and to stimulate col-laboration in our collective ability to research, create andoperationalize optimal evidence informed integrative care. Foster Whole Systems Research Committed to practices that respect the whole human being throughuse of diverse modalities and often through teams of practitioners,we personally champion development of methods, funding, and dis- semination of research that address chronic diseases from multiple etiologies and treatments that often are best resolved through wholeperson and whole systems approaches.Aware that questions related to cost are often an obstacle to the system-wide implementation of these models and thus access to these services, we will personally endeavor to support heightenedfocus on research that includes the economic dimensions of integra-tive models of care.BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 2 of 165Stimulate Collaboration Given the limitations and harm that can emanate for professions and stakeholders operating in isolation, we challenge ourselves individu-ally, and within our own professional organizations and institutions,to commit to programs and projects that stimulate increased respect, collaboration and understanding across disciplines, traditions, profes- sions, and stakeholders.Bridge Clinical Care with Prevention, Community and Public HealthKnowing that clinical medical interventions represent but 10% -20% of the factors that shape the health of a community, we actively en-gage in creative methods to deepen the preventive and lifestyle di-mensions of our individual practices while also connecting ourpractices and patients to community and public health resources. Engage as Change Agents Recognizing that imbalances in social, environmental, economic andpolitical structures are major influences in the health of citizens, weseek to foster more equitable communities and societies. To better empower our own work, we seek to expand our abilities to work closer and more constructively with other professions, govern-ment agencies, non-governmental organizations, private and not forprofit businesses, patients and other stakeholders in advancing inte- grative health and medicine. Through engaging these personal and social responsibilities, we willimprove individual patient care and positively influence the precon-ditions of healthcare systems, locally and globally, to achieve optimal health and healing in the individuals, communities and planet we serve. 1Definition of Integrative Medicine and Health.

Plenaries Plenary session I S1The lessons from integrative medicine: sometimes less really ismoreJosephine P Briggs NCCIH, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): S1 It is widely recognized that our health care system does too much of some things, and too little of others. Learning what actually works and for whom -finding the true balance between benefit and harm - is the charge to the biomedical research enterprise. Negativefindings are as important a product of evidence-based medicine asthe positives. Three examples will be explored: cancer screening, pain management, and end-of life care. Critical examination of common health care practices in these areas is yielding surprises;careful examination of data from observational studies and largescale randomized trials is frequently finding less benefit than expected (or even harm) of some drugs, widely used screening strategies, and other health interventions; and in some cases a morefavorable benefit to harm ratio of gentle 'old-fashioned 'approaches that come from outside the mainstream. Nevertheless, translation of evidence into good care remains prob- lematic. Increasingly it is understood that the answers will lie in partwith greater patient engagement and shared decision making. Inte-grative medicine practitioners are defining an innovative style of practice that provides a model for greater openness to the patient 's voice. Health care decision making needs to more effectively marry the insights that come from evidence-based medicine with the indi-vidual values of each patient. Integrative practitioners tap into an interest of patients in greater involvement and often in less use of technology. While the input and expertise of the health care practi-tioner is essential for good care, so is an active, partnership with thepatient and the flexibility to adapt to the patient 's concerns. S2Traditional medicine and primary healthcare in Africa Merlin Willcox (Merlin.willcox@phc.ox.ac.uk) Department of Primary Care and Population Sciences, University ofSouthampton, Aldermoor Health Centre, Coxford Rd, Southampton Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): S2 Background It is often stated that 80% of the world 's population relies on traditional medicine for their primary health care [1]. However very few countriesin Africa have attempted to integrate traditional and modern healingsystems for the benefit of patients. On the contrary, traditional medi-cine has been widely discouraged and some practices even banned. We set out to investigate ways in which traditional and modern med- ical systems could better collaborate, for the benefit of patients.MethodsSurveys were undertaken in Mali, Uganda and Ethiopia of treatments used by patients for febrile illnesses, and associated outcomes. In Mali, we selected the plant associated with the best outcomes forfurther clinical research using a \"reverse pharmacology\" approach [2], in order to develop an improved traditional medicine. In Mali and Uganda, the \"confidential enquiry \"methodology was used to investi- gate maternal, perinatal and child deaths in a total of 10 subdistricts over 3 years. Local panels analysed how deaths could have beenavoided by improvements in both traditional and modern medical systems, and made recommendations to this effect. ResultsPrevalence of use of traditional medicine for febrile illnesses variedwidely, from 0% in the Apac district of Uganda, to 60% in the Sikasso area of Mali [3]. Of 66 plants traditionally used in Mali, Argemone mexicana was the only one systematically associated with clinical re-covery. This was further investigated in a dose-escalating trial [4],and then in a randomised controlled trial [5]. Its use has since in- creased. The confidential enquiry revealed that traditional healers and traditional birth attendants had been involved in the care of15% of children who had died (ranging from 5% to 36% in differentdistricts), whereas official health centres and hospitals had been in- volved in 58% of cases in Mali and 49% in Uganda. The majority of children who had consulted a traditional healer had not been re-ferred in a timely manner. Training courses were organised to im-prove recognition and referral of severe illnesses. Conclusions In Africa, usage of traditional medicine in primary care is still preva-lent, at least for febrile illness in children, including illnesses whichare eventually fatal. The \"reverse pharmacology \"approach facilitated the development of an evidence-based improved traditional medi-cine in Mali, which became more widely used. The \"confidential en- quiry \"approach engaged both traditional and modern practitionersBMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 3 of 165together in a discussion of what could be done to reduce childhood deaths.

Plenary session II S3 Evidence of effectiveness but not efficacy - why many complementary therapies are so hard to accept for biomedicineKlaus Linde (klaus .linde@tum.de) Institute of General Practice, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): S3 While the integration of complementary therapies into health care practice continues to progress in many countries, the scientific and academic debate on many of these therapies seems to heat up againin the last decade after a period of relative openness. Interestingly,both those attacking and defending complementary medicine claim that their view is evidence-based. In my presentation I will try to analyze important reasons why there is so much, often fierce debate.Using acupuncture and homeopathy as examples I will show howthe same evidence is sometimes interpreted completely different. The more controversial the topic, the more interpretation is shaped by the influence of prior beliefs, personal preference of differenttypes of evidences, previous knowledge and experience. The mainproblem for the acceptance of many complementary therapies is not the lack of evidence that patients benefit but weak theoretical foun- dations (leading again to stronger demand of proof of specificity). Iwill explain why \"specificity \"is such a crucial tool for demarcation of the unacceptable, both for science and the medical profession. At the same time, many of these \"intellectual \"problems do not seem to be relevant in the pragmatic reality of everyday practice. In my view there are two important consequences of these consider-ations: 1) a public debate is needed whether \"scientific nonsense \" could be effective in practice -and if so, whether it should be reim- bursed by public health insurance; 2) there is a strong need for moreresearch on how complementary therapies work, but this researchshould not take the often na\u00efve and mechanistic theoretical concepts of these therapies as granted. Plenary session III S4 Arts in health promotion T\u00f6res Theorell1,2 1Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden; 2Stress Research Institute, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): S4 Arts (music, writing, dance, visual arts and theatre) have a strong potential in health promotion. Health can be defined in many ways,ranging from strict absence of medical conditions to well-being in a wide social sense [1]. When we discuss musical experiences, flow is potentially a central concept in health promotion. The flow conceptis particularly applicable to music performance. When a subject haspracticed a difficult music piece and is finally able to perform it well, a high level of arousal and at the same time a high degree of elationarises. Our own experiments indicate that this state is associatedwith a concomitant activation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. A subject who is allowed to have these rare experiences repeatedly collects flow experiences which add to ahigh quality of life. This would correspond to life-long flow capital . Flow experiences can arise in several domains, in sports, while performing theatre, while giving a lecture etc. According to our theory flow experiences add importantly to quality of life.Alexithymia , inability to differentiate, describe and communicate feel- ings, is a central concept in psychosomatic medicine. Our research has shown that competence in arts is associated with a good ability to handle emotions. Each one of the artistic skills (see above) addsstatistically to emotional ability and there are also additive effects.Since alexithymia has an established role in early stages of hyperten- sion, burnout syndrome and abuse of alcohol these relationships are of importance to health promotion. However, our twin research hasshown that a large part of the relationship between musical practiceand alexithymia is genetically determined [2,3]. Therefore relatively large controlled intervention studies are required in order to estab- lish health effects of musical experiences. An RCT study, the CulturePalette study, performed on health care centres in Stockholm,showed that cultural activities organized for women with burnout syndrome for three months twice a week were followed by improved burnout and alexithymia scores which were not seen in the controlgroup [4]. The alexithymia changes were even more pronouncedthree months after the cultural intervention than immediately after the end, findings which may indicate that health promotion pro- cesses have started. Efforts to stimulate cultural activities should startin childhood [5]. References 1.

Wong (lisamwong@gmail.com) Arts and Humanities Initiative, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USABMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): S5 The arts are an essential element of human life that foster health,wellness and balance. Through the arts, the relationship betweenpractitioner and patient can be affirmed and deepened. The arts inmedicine focus on the whole person, making use of several therapeutic approaches: through dance, individuals living with movement disorders enhance their flexibility with grace andconfidence; through mask-making, wounded veterans find a voice asthey struggle with PTSD. Integrating the arts into the practice of medicine presents an exciting new intersection of fields. Important new questions emerge. What isthe role of the physician musician? How can the experience andknowledge of music therapist, neuroscientist and physician best be utilized to institute a personalized care plan for the patient? WhatBMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 4 of 165does evidence-based practice look like through the lens of the artist in healthcare settings? Caregivers and healthcare providers in training also benefit from theintegration of the arts into their practice. Narrative medicine encour-ages healthcare providers to understand their own story, as well as the patient 's story, beyond the diagnosis. Looking deeply at art in the museum enhances observation skills, critical thinking, and com- munication. Analyzing, playing and listening to music invites deeperreflection and analysis of complex diagnoses. Join the growing number of physicians, musicians, therapists, neuro- scientists, and patients who are embracing the arts as a critical as-pect of integrative medicine. Together we will pave the way forward,discover new parallels, learn from each other, and ultimately improve the way we care for our patients and each other. Plenary session IV S6 Integrating complementary and integrative health therapies into US hospitals -the role of practice based research in guiding the field Jeffrey DusekPsychosomatic medicine, Neuropsychology, Allina Health, Minneapolis, MN, Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): S6 Consumer demand for complementary and integrative health (CIH) therapies continues to grow in the United States (US). As a result, about 15 years ago, several US health systems were early adopters inthe inclusion of CIH therapies into hospital settings. Severalrandomized controlled trials provided initial evidence that specific CIH therapies (e.g., acupuncture) were efficacious for relief of symptoms (e.g., pain) in certain hospitalized patient populations (e.g.,post-surgery). Additional studies suggested that the CIH therapieswere safe for these patients. While results of the randomized trials were important, translation of these results into clinical practice has been challenging due to the fact that neither health careadministrators, nor clinical providers are aware of which CIH therapywould be most effective for specific condition relief in specific patient populations. An important question being asked is: can the right patient be provided the right CIH therapy for the right symptom reliefoutcome? This presentation will include a description of thedevelopment and evolution of one early adopter model for the integration of CIH therapies services into a US hospital setting. The presentation will also include results from a large National Institutes ofHealth practice based research evaluation in the early adopter modelto explore the effectiveness of different CIH therapies on pain in varied clinical populations. The presentation will detail lessons learned from these experiences that will provide health care system administratorsand clinical providers with guidance for efficient delivery of CIHtherapies in US hospital settings and perhaps across the world. S7 Integrating CAM into hospital care: prospectives from China(Abstract ID 220)Darong Wu 2nd Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, ChinaBMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): S7 ObjectiveThe integration of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM)and western medi-cine in China was initiated more than a century ago. Since early 1950s,TCM as one of the important component of complementary and alter- native medicine (CAM), has been integrated into hospital care, including inpatients\"medical services, due to several practical reasons, e.g. China\"shealth policy, Chinese traditions, patient\"s promises and claims, etc.Methods There are mainly two types of model in terms of integration TCM into inpatient/hospital settings in China, (1) Disease-based model,which has been adopted in most of the western medicine hospitals,especially in the departments of cardiovascular disease, tumor dis- ease, or other rehabilitation related diseases, or virus infection dis- eases; (2) Pattern diagnose-based model, usually is applied in thehospitals of integrative medicine or TCM medicine. Despite the typesof model, more and more physicians and other health care profes- sionals realize that it is important to help the patients to make in- formed health care decision during the integration procedure. And itshall combine the management methods which have been success-fully applied in hospital operation, including clinical pathways and lean management. ResultsClinical pathways has been adopted to efficient the progress of inte-grating TCM into inpatient services since 2002 in China. Researches found that it might help to reduce the length of stay, to maintain the cost within a reasonable range, and would still keep the qualityof medical services in the same or even higher levels. The ideas ofevidence-based practice, patient-informed decision,etc, have been embodied, while we would not ignore any \"unexpected\" outcomes from clinical practiceswhichmight be \"new\" into inpatient services has six-decade history in China, any further development in this area may face both opportun-ities and challenges ahead.Keywords: Integration, Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM), Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Hospital Care, China Plenary session V S8Nutrition and lifestyle education in an era of obesity and diabetes -might \"Teaching Kitchens \"serve as catalysts of personal and societal transformation?David Eisenberg Department of Nutrition, Harvard University T H Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA 02115, USABMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): S8 To address dramatic global increases in obesity, diabetes and otherlifestyle-related diseases, the medical establishment must invent andexperiment with novel approaches whereby patients -and caregivers as role models -learn to eat, cook, move and think differently.

More than half of all physicians in the United States experience some elementof burnout, and this can lead to changes in the patient-providerrelationship and adversely impact on the quality of care. In some specialties, the rates are even higher. This trend may begin earlier with the observed decline in empathy during medical studenttraining and the alarming rates of burnout in medical and otherstudents in the health professions. In response, various groups are developing interventions with medical students, residents and faculty to address the rise in burnout and the decline in professionalresiliency. Keys to this work are themes of self-awareness,mindfulness and exploring domains of control and meaning in the clinical encounter. In this plenary presentation, Dr. Haramati will review published outcomes on interventions using mindfulnessapproaches to reduce stress and burnout and improve wellbeing. Aphysiologic framework will be provided to explain why mindfulness appears to be effective. He will also share his perspective on why it is essential to incorporate mind-body techniques into the trainingcurriculum for all health professionals\u2014 something that will require both skill and courage.

Clinical care A4Integrated Cchronic Care Model and diabetes: the project asimplemented within the Center of Integrated Medicine of theHospital of Pitigliano Rosaria Ferreri (tyvvf@tin.it) Hospital Pitiglian,o ASL SudEstToscana, Grosseto, 17(Suppl 1): A4 The care of people with diabetes is, all over the developed world,and now, even in countries in the developing world, one of the mainproblems of organization of systems of health protection. This goes far beyond the meaning of the care of a single disease, but rather is almost a paradigm of the Chronic Care Model, which, in mostcompanies in the world, it is epidemiologically prevalent today.The challenge of this project is to develop an integrated protocol including Homeopathy and Phytotherapy to evaluate how, where and when it is possible to introduce the integrated protocol inthe course of the CCM Diabetes. Proposals has been accepted bythe chief of Medicine Department of the Hospital of Pitigliano. We are going to study different categories of diabetic patients in- cluded in the project:BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 6 of 1651) Patients that have high value of emoglobina glicata, despite their anti diabetic oral therapy; 2) Patients that suffer from comorbidities (that could have influenced their metabolic status and the course of their diabetes) We have approached the patients, collecting their informed consent,and establishing the integrated protocol to be adopted in each of the two categories. The protocols include: -an homeopathic remedy -a phytotherapy compound, made of two plants extracts A group of 20 diabetic patients have been enrolled, ten of them were affected by diabetes and other ten have comorbidities; for eachof them, we have collected data related to: blood sugar level, gly- cated haemoglobin, renal and hepatic function, blood pressure, (other parameters that will be included in a second phase of the pro-ject). To each of them we have given: a Questionnary (as SF12) forthe quality of life and ADL skills for daily ability; we have also used EDMONTON scales for the assessment of symptoms and a CARD for the consumption of conventional drugs, to monitoring the use of an-tidiabetic drugs.Results and discussion We describe: /C15A new organisational model, which includes new roles andnew functions. /C15A new common pathway. /C15How to identify proactive patient using risk stratification tools. /C15How we have improved hospital infrastructure, which supportssharing information and patient monitoring. A common set of shared objectives and indicators linked to health outcomes and process improvement have been adepte and we\"ll show the results in terms of: /C15Ameliorating QoL: from 68 to 85% of them declare improvements in the general health feelings /C15Improving HB glycate value : in 12 weeks have been improvedabout - 10%- /C15Reducing use of conventional drugs: Phyto-nutrition and diabetes Rosaria of Pitigliano, 1): A5 IntroductionManaging blood glucose and preventing complications in diabetes care are important goals for anyone with this chronic disease. Nutri- ents present in various foods play an important role in maintainingthe normal functions of the human body and some phytonutrientshelp to lower blood glucose. Others protect insulin-producing cells in the pancreas from oxidative damage. But where can we get these nutrients? The best challenge is to have them through a studied diet,not only based upon calories and nutrients, but also taking in ac-count the so called phyto-nutrients. That also why, recently, vegeter- ian regimen has been proposed to be the best to cope with diabetes.Materials and methodsPhytonutrients are the plant nutrients with specific biological activ- ities that support human health. Due to the fact that some of thesenutrients have a great and recognized role in the help of chronicconditions, as diabetes is, we have tried to include them in the com- position of an ideal diet, not based upon the energetic values but onphytonutrients and their ORAC value.Discussion Well show the composition of an ideal diet for patients with dia- betes, that could be more helpful in the control of hyper insulin-ism and also in the control of oxidation process. We propose ourrationale for the choice of foods and their distribution during the day, based upon the best research in the field of plant-derived preparations, such as pomegranate seed oil[1], grape skin extract[2], orange extract [3] cherries [5], and green tea (2)-epigallocatechin-3 [6]. We also show that this strategy is also comparatively cheap, easy to be used by aged people and could significantly reduce health carecosts.Bibliography 1.

The participants should learn basic osteopathic principles, their indication and contraindication aswell as the integration of osteopathy into the overall treatment strat-egy of a patient. During the hands-on part of the workshop partici- pants are given a practical demonstration of basic examination procedure with special emphasis on palpation, as well as selectedtreatment techniques. Education A9Implementing skills from hypnosis and improvedoctor-patient communicationElad Schiff 1, Zahi Arnon2,3 1Internal medicine and Complementary medicine service, Bnai Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel;2Complementary-Integrative Surgery Service, Bnai Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel;3The Valley, education toward optimal physician-patient communica-tion does not take into account the impact of positive and negative suggestions on health and disease. Moreover, there is vast evidencein the medical literature that such suggestions can trigger placebo,or nocebo effects respectively. As an example, saying to a patient \"here are your pain pills\" implies that the patient owns the pain (nocebo), whereas \"here are medications that will help you reducepain, and increase your comfort\" activate patient empowerment andcontrol over pain (placebo). Implementing fundamentals of hypnosis to suggestions embedded in communication with patients can tre- mendously improve the outcomes of such encounters.Hypnosis is a mind-body technique aimed to activate innate healingforces by using words with positive suggestions as well as non- verbal communication such as touch. The effect of hypnosis is thought to occur best in a \"trance state\" where the sub-consciousmind is more receptive to suggestions, which are conveyed to thenervous & immune systems. In contrast to the common belief that hypnosis requires patients to be calm and relaxed, hypnotic trance due to stressful health conditions is very common. Actually, patientsare in spontaneous trance state during most encounters with physi-cians. Hypnotic trance places patients in a state-of-mind where they are highly influenced by suggestions- for the good (placebo), and for the bad (nocebo). Consequently, physicians could learn how to acti-vate patient's healing forces by using the correct suggestions in ver-bal and non-verbal communication (i.e. touch and body gestures), based on fundamentals of hypnosis. The workshop will introduce health-providers and medical students to hypnotic basedcommunication that potentiates the healing capacity of patients. Vid- eos of real patient-physician encounters as well and vivid demonstra- tions, and hands on techniques to improve physical exam skills, arebuilt in the workshop.

EPAs are becoming an important part of out- comes based education and are increasingly looked at being essen- tial in preparing students for graduate medical training. Thisworkshop will build on precourse assignments, start with an inter-active summary of this knowledge and will then shift to experiential as we create the opportunity for participants to work in groups and develop team-based core EPAs in integrative medicine that includeinterprofessional practice.Outline of Workshop 1.

A11Differentiating the psychological and physiological mechanisms of relaxation versus mindfulness: an experiential workshop andclinical implicationsChristina M. Luberto (cluberto@mgh.harvard.edu) Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston MA, USA BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): A11BMC Complementary Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 8 of 165Mind-body therapies, used to treat a variety of stress and pain- related conditions, often include the use of both relaxation tech- niques and mindfulness exercises. Relaxation techniques are inter-ventions such as progressive muscle relaxation and diaphragmaticbreathing that are intended to alter physiological and emotional states by eliciting the relaxation response. Mindfulness techniques, which can be taught using stand-alone exercises (e.g., mindfulbreathing, mindful sitting) or formal mindfulness-based interventions(e.g., Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction), are intended to promote present moment awareness and acceptance as a way of enhancing self-regulation. Thus, there is a distinct difference in both theintention and, ultimately, the psychological and physiological mecha-nisms associated with these two approaches - which have important implications for informing clinical practice. Unfortunately, over time, the term \"mind-body therapies \"has become synonymous with both the use of relaxation therapies and mindfulness techniques, therebyobscuring these critical differences. Therefore, the primary purpose of this workshop is to provide partici- pants with a deeper understanding of the differences in the psycho-logical and physiological mechanisms associated with relaxationversus mindfulness techniques, using a combination of experiential exercises and brief didactics. Four relaxation and mindfulness exer- cises (20-30 minutes each) will be used throughout the workshop toallow participants to experientially learn the difference betweenthese two approaches. Each exercise will be followed by paired and/ or group discussions to provide opportunities for processing and re- flection. Three didactics will be interspersed throughout the work-shop in order to supplement the experiential exercises: (1)theoretical/conceptual similarities and differences between relaxation and mindfulness approaches; (2) extant research documenting differ- ences in psychological and physiological mechanisms and outcomesbetween these approaches; and (3) implications for clinical practiceand research settings. Case examples will be used to exemplify when relaxation versus mindfulness training would be most clinically indi- cated based on evidence-based recommendations. This session de-serves to be included in the program because it provides a depth oftheoretical and practical knowledge that can help clinicians and re- searchers alike more accurately differentiate between types of mind- body practices to select interventions best suited to their clients ' needs. This level of nuance, comparing and contrasting specificmind-body approaches, is also an important next step for moving the field of mind-body medicine forward.

This will include aspects ofcurriculum development like needs assessment, finding and settingadequate goals, learning objectives and the use of feedback and evaluation. Participants will be given an overview about the opportunities andchallenges of IM clerkships, examples from 12 years of experiencesof establishing and conducting IM Clerkships within the Integrated Curriculum for Anthroposophic Medicine. Traditional healing systems A15 Herbal medicine research: from margins to mainstream Andrew Flower University of Southampton, Southampton, SO16 5ST, United 17(Suppl 1): A15 This pre-congress-workshop allows the participant to explore differ-ent research methods used to investigate herbal medicines as doneat the University of Southampton.The key domains of herbal medicine research such as quality control, batch consistency, the importance of stabilising levels of known ac- tive compounds, interactions with pharmaceuticals, model validity,and herbal pharmacokinetics will be considered.Besides, the idea is to develop a model for future research into herbal medicines that can incorporate a properly phased, iterative programme of research that will optimise both pragmatic rigour andthe clinical relevance of these investigations. A16 Cost and health benefits from integrating new age Ayurveda into European health systems Harsha Gramminger 1,2 1Euroved GmbH, Bell, Germany;2European Ayurveda and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): A16 General Health Costs are spiraling in all developed and developingnations of the world. In 2013, Germany spent almost \u20ac315 billion on health. This was an increase of about \u20ac12,1 billion compared to 2012 : 3910,00 \u20acin 2013 vs. 3770,00 \u20acin 2012 per inhabitant. Type 2 Diabetes, Obesity, Hyperlipidemia, Hypertension & Other\"civilization \"diseases are the main factors for these costs. With over 8 million sufferers (in 2009 and growing), Diabetes Mellitus is one ofthe most widespread diseases in Germany. Serious \"secondary com- plications \"and \"associated diseases \"/co-morbidities include heart at- tack, stroke, athlete 's foot etc. Total costs \u20ac3.817.00 includes three components: Direct - disease (), Indirect () & associated complication() Obesity is another new global epidemic and set to become the\"number one health problem globally \"by the year 2025. In 2013 52% of all Germans were overweight, which is about 42.02 Million people! The associated conditions include: Type 2 Diabetes, Hyper- tension, Vascular diseases, Stroke, Coronary heart disease, Gall stones,Cancer, Sleep Apnea Syndrome, Diseases of the joints and of the skinand more. Clinical and practical experience is proven, that Ayurveda is able to improve the condition of both Type 2 diabetes and Obes- ity. Furthermore it is able by its lifestyle guidance and preventive hol-istic approach, to reduce and avoid follow -up diseases and costs. The presentation will show with facts and figures how the wisdom of Ayurveda can be followed for the New Age to prevent, manage and cure such diseases. Figures for savings to the European Health carecosts will be presented and discussed.

A17 Ayurvedic herbs in modern timesHedwig H Gupta (info@dr-gupta.de) Private Medical Practice, Ludwigsburg, 71638, Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): A17 Ayurveda is an Asian Medical System with a history of more thanthree thousand years. Through the centuries, as documented by ayurvedic texts, the mate-ria medica kept changing slightly as new plants were described andadded. But all in all the system stayed stable as the population using ayurvedic herbs grew only slowly and the usage of ayurvedic plants was confined mainly to southern Asia.With the globalization of medical systems and the development ofmodern life Ayurveda faces tremendous changes which give rise to many questions that will be discussed in this presentation as: How can Ayurveda be practiced if more and more people use its herbs?Many classically described herbs are grown in the Himalayans orother areas of a very specific climate. Is it feasable and sensible for the whole world to use these plants? What effects do environmental changes, industrial agriculture of herbs and pollution have on thequality of herbs? How can locally grown plants be understood andintegrated in a modern and ecologically correct ayurvedic therapy? A18 West meets east - differences in general attitudes between European and Indian Ayurveda-patientsSN Gupta 1,2(guptayurveda@yahoo.com) 1Kayacikitsa (PG) Department, J. S. Ayurveda college & P.D. Patel Ayurveda Hospital, Nadiad (Gujarat), India;2Academic advisory board, European Academy of Ayurveda, Birstein, Germany BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): A18 Human behavior is always influenced by sociocultural environments.This is applicable also for patients, particularly regarding their atti-tude towards their disease, its treatment, their health service pro-viders and co-patients. With a growing popularity of Ayurveda, contacts of European patients with Ayurvedic doctors are also grow- ing. Socio-cultural differences may cause bilateral difficulties, often inthe form of a cultural shock . To develop a physician-patient rapport, it is essential for the physician to understand these aspects, in which European patients differ from their Indian counterparts. The article is not based on a scientific research, but on a 20 years ' observation in treating a great number of European patients in Indiaand in Germany. Faith and evidence For Indians faith in the system is prime. For them the tradition ofthousands of years is not challengeable. While in the West, an evi-dence based rational approach is the dominant factor. Decisions and actions are less emotionally driven as in Indians. Religious and spirit- ual beliefs play important roles in the context of healing for Indianpatients, while Europeans expect scientifically evaluated therapies.Individuality and relationship Familial and social bonds in India are very strong therefore family members or close friends of a patient take care of the basic needseven a decision about treatment. While In the West, since the indi-viduality is dominating, usually patient has to look after himself to- gether with a decision about the treatment. Disclosing abilityWestern patients are very good in disclosing and explaining theirproblems, which is helpful for the physician. While in India, certain aspects of life, though very important e.g. sex, are still taboos.PrivacyIf European patients tend to respect other patients 'privacy and not embarras them by intervening while Indians, when upset, generally value people showing concern.Accuracy Europeans expect accuracy in everything. These features are seldom seen in Indian patients.The mentioned differences still can be observed in most parts ofIndia. But a few westernized islands already exist in India, too, mainly in urban Indian centers, where the differences are not as obvious. A19 Home remedies from all over the world -evaluation and educationAnnette Kerckhoff Naturopathy, Charit\u00e9 University Hospital, Berlin, Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): A19 This workshop focuses on the evaluation of traditional folk remediesfrom all over the world. The top ten ingredients for home remedies will be examined closer; relevant data from food pharmacology andclinical trials will be presented to understand the active principle. Re-liable and safe simple interventions are presented and advice for education is given. These evaluated interventions using easy-to-get, worldwide spreadand cheap ingredients can support health and self-efficacy. A20 Ayurveda in Europe -what 's needed when healing tradition travels abroad?Christian S Kessler 1,2, Andreas Michalsen1,2 1Institute of Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics, Charit\u00e9 University, Berlin, Germany;2Department for Complementary Medicine, Immanuel Hospital Berlin, Berlin, GermanyCorrespondence: Christian S Kessler (c.kessler@immanuel.de) BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): A20 Ayurveda is one of the oldest codified traditional systems ofmedicine worldwide. During the last decades an increasing usageand acceptance of Ayurveda in countries outside of its originalcontext, particularly in European countries and North America, has been observed. Notably, Ayurveda has developed quite het- erogeneously during this journey by interacting with other con-cepts of healing and philosophy. Depending on where and bywhom it is being practiced and called upon, it has taken different shapes to different degrees depending on a significant number of cultural, political, economic, geographical and other factors.Due to this complexity, interdisciplinary Ayurveda research andnetworking is required in all related fields, e.g. medicine, anthro- pology, philosophy, Indology, religious sciences and health eco- nomics, in order to further clarify Ayurveda 's current statuses in Western countries and its health care potentials in countries out-side of South Asia. This pre-conference workshop invites (1) lead- ing scientists in the field to present their research work related to Ayurveda as practiced outside of South Asia, (2) senior clini-cians with long standing expertise in treating patients with Ayur-vedic medicine in Western contexts to share their experience, and (3) board members of the leading Western therapists 'associ- ations for Ayurveda (D\u00c4GAM,VEAT, AFGIM, EUAA, EURAMA, DGA and others) to highlight crucial aspects related to national/supra-national health care economics and policy making. This session deserves to be included in the program because Ayurveda is one of the fastest growing traditional systems of medicine in Westerncountries, however, it is still lacking acceptance as a whole sys-tem of medicine in conventional mainstream medicine. This ses- sion aims to develop strategies for a long-term inclusion ofBMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 10 of 165evidence-based Ayurvedic therapies into reimbursable Western health care delivery and health education in countries outside of South Asia. 6 interconnected short presentations (10 + 3 min.) willbe followed by a 40 min. round table discussion to conclude the120 min. session. A21 Clinical trials on Ayurveda in western countries: implications for future projectsChristian S Kessler 1,2(c.kessler@immanuel.de) 1Institute for Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics, Charit\u00e9 University, Berlin, Germany;2Immanuel Hospital Berlin, Department for Complementary Medicine, Berlin, Germany BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): A21 Clinical research on traditional systems of medicine like Ayurvedashould not just be doing research on unconventional therapies byusing conventional methodology. Several issues have to be takeninto account in order to facilitate a successful implementation of clin- ical trials that should simultaneously fulfill quality criteria of modern research methodology and internal criteria of complex whole sys-tems approaches like Ayurveda. Moreover, within international col-laboration projects cultural-, context- and setting-aspects as well as clear research communication between partners have to be taken into account in order to guarantee fruitful research cooperation. Ex-periences from clinical trials on Ayurveda in Germany will be pre-sented, outlining chances, challenges, obstacles and pitfalls.

Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): A22 During the process of treating diseases and enhancing the health ofpregnant women, Korean Medical Treatment increases rate of suc- cess of other medical treatments, at the same time as reducing anycomplications to help maintain pregnancy and induce term delivery.Under the binary medical system, separated as western and Korean Medicine Systems, there are various treatment modules for the im- provement of pregnant women and the management of diseasesduring pregnancy.In this respect, we suggest Korean Medical Treatment including acu- puncture, moxibustion, hip steam bath, and traditional medicine as an effective adjuvant tool, could help reduce any complicationcaused by other medical treatments and even help improve healthof patients overall. As the title of this year 's conference means, for the comprehensive patient care, introduction of integrative KoreanMedicine Treatment would give a safe and effective way to reducecomplications and, later improve overall health of patients psycho-logically and physically. On the whole, Korean gynecology, based on the theory of traditional Korean Medicine, encompasses the disciplines of physiology andpathology of pregnant women from conception till delivery. Emesisgravidarum or cold is a common complication that occurs during early pregnancy period. It is possible to treat common cold with proper management of symptom such as prevention of pathogenicfactors. Abortions such as threatened abortion can be prevented withinducing hemostasis and speeding up the absorption of hematoma. There might be preterm labor associated with development of the fetus during the mid-pregnancy because of plummeting bearing cap-acity of uterine lining. This can be improved by increasing blood flowto uttering lining. Even in case of placenta previa, increasing bloodflow to placenta would and slow down placenta previa. Amniotic fluid is interrelated with nutrition supply to fetus, so oligohydramnios can be partially improved just byincreasing blood flow to the fetus. Growth of the fetus gives strainon your waist and causes musculoskeletal pain. Once the blood flow to the fetus naturally increases, muscles and ligaments supporting musculoskeletal system weaken. Consequently, musculoskeletal painoccurs in spite of little movement. This can be improved by applyingacupuncture, moxibustion, Korean physical therapy. Delivery can be completed by the contraction of uterus. In Korean medicine, natural delivery does not mean reducing the pain, but shortening the paininterval. Thus, maximizing blood flow to uterine lining would shortenpain interval to achieve natural delivery. A23 Ayurveda and salutogenesis Martin Mittwede (martin.mittwede@ayurveda-akademie.org)Director, Faculty of Ayurvedic Medicine, European Academy Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): A23 Since more than 2500 years Ayurveda is based on concepts thatwere developed from a combination of philosophy and clinical prac- tice. From a modern perspective we have to ask whether Ayurveda is more than a philosophy of life or a knowledge system. Traditionalsystems of medicine have a strong focus on health, wellbeing andprevention. Ayurveda does not only include medicine and therapy, but is also a teaching of balanced life. On the basis of knowing oneself and know-ing what is really strengthening or weakening in life, right decisionscan be made which are the basis of action in everyday life and lead to good habits. In this sense, knowledge of life also includes profound self-knowledge and healthoriented action. Inner and outer reality areconnected to one another and give an integrated feeling of life (sense of coherence in the sense of salutogenesis) Through scientific research, not only the successes of Ayurvedic ther-apies can be examined, but also the beneficial effects of a balancedlife. It is important that the research approaches reflect the complex nature of the ayurvedic system and the multifactorial genesis of health as well.By comparing Ayurveda with concepts of Salutogenesis deeper in-sights in traditional medical systems can be reached; and these can inspire new lines of empirical research. A24 Introducing Ayurveda in a GP practiceWiebke Mohme (mohme@gmx.net)Ayurveda and naturopathy, General Practice, Hamburg Eimsb\u00fcttel, Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): A24 A large percentage of patients asking for Ayurveda in my GP practicesuffer from stress-related and psychosomatic diseases. Ayurvedic concepts of lifestyle changes, diet, physical therapies and phytother-apy tailored to the individual state and constitution offer a perspec-tive towards healing. Due to limited resources in terms of time, finances and availability of remedies and therapies practical ap- proaches have to be chosen to translate these concepts into practicalsteps that fit into patients 'everyday life. To talk with the patients and explaining everything in a way they can relate to becomes cru- cible. The inclusion of yoga practice, breathing techniques, relaxation and meditation have proven useful and effective. The focus is onsupporting the patient's motivation to change their condition, andexploring the patient's resources, skills and potential. If a condition cannot be changed it is important to foster acceptance of what is. Since most of the success of a treatment depends on the patient'scooperation and homework, anything that is offered has to add asense of joy and satisfaction to their life.BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 11 of 165Various topics A25 Refugees with chronic diseases between the Middle-East and Europe: the role of traditional and integrative medicine center, Clalit Health Services, Haifa, Israel;2Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel;3The Association for Integrative Oncologic for Integrative Oncology, Florence, Italy;9Cerrahpa a Medical Faculty, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey;10St. George Hospital, Balamand University, Beirut, Lebanon; 11Children 's Welfare Teaching Hospital, Baghdad, Iraq;12Radiation & Isotope Centre, Khartoum, Sudan;13Ministry of Health, Amman, Jordan; Care Oncology, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Cancer Consortium, Haifa, Israel Correspondence: A25 The recent wave of immigration from the Middle-East to Europe has intensified the need to find a model for supportive care which is tai-lored to the dominant paradigm of health belief among refugees,with its high affinity for complementary and traditional (CTM) medi- cine. The Middle-Eastern context of health care contrasts significantly from that of integrative medicine research and clinical practice whichis prevalent in Europe and other developed nations, where comple-mentary medicine is typically used by patients from the upper socio- economic and educational level of society. The goal of the workshop will be to address the cross-cultural health conflicts experienced byrefugees from the Middle East who have fled to Europe. The work-shop will be comprised of integrative physicians from Middle Eastern countries invited by the Middle-East Cancer Consortium, as well as leading European figures from the field of integrative medicine. Thisworkshop reflects the commitment of clinicians and researchers fromEurope and the Middle East to bridge cross-cultural gaps experi- enced by refugees and health care providers by the use of an inte- grative bio-psycho-social-spiritual approach. Young people in integrative healthcare -workshops Y1 Open dialogue with experts A Conversation with ExpertsLena Bandelin, Anna-Lena LangInstitute for Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics, Charit\u00e9 University Hospital, Berlin, Germany BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): Y1 This workshop will provide a space for conversation between stu-dents, young doctors, practitioners, and experts in the field of inte- grative medicine. This meeting will be casual in nature, wheregeneral questions that represent the diverse perspective may beasked to explore issues related to pursuing a career in integrative medicine. This session is for people who may ponder: What does in- tegrative medicine mean to me? What does a holistic approach topatient care mean? Where do I see myself in the medical health sys-tem of the future? How will I get there? What integrative medicine resources are available to me to inform and improve medical prac- tice? Hearing perspective from experts in various fields of integrativemedicine whose work ranges from research to patient care, inpatientto outpatient practice, and public to private practice will help the at- tendee of this session have a better understanding of how to navi- gate their journey in integrative medicine.

Symposia Research X1 Yoga in therapy and prevention: the current state of the science on utilization, efficacy and safety Holger Cramer1, Romy Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia;3Charit\u00e9 -University Medical Centre, Berlin, Germany;4Oxford University, Oxford, UK Correspondence: Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): X1 As yoga is gaining increased popularity as a therapeutic practice, ithas become one of the therapies with the most rapid increase inprevalence. Accordingly, yoga 's potential as a preventive or thera- peutic means has been explored in a growing number of clinical tri- als to date. The purpose of this symposium is to present a comprehensive overview on the state of the science on the applica-tion of yoga in therapy and prevention. Presenters will review scien-tific research on utilization, efficacy, and safety of yoga for the general population as well as for selected patient samples with spe- cific mental or physical conditions. Dr. Lauche will present data onthe association between yoga and weight control from clinical trials,systematic reviews and current cross-sectional analyses. Dr. Michal- sen's presentation will cover the current state of knowledge on yoga for stress reduction and include results of a new study on yoga for stress reduction in schools. Dr. Ward will present data on yoga forpregnancy, and for neurological conditions; and discuss the content of yoga interventions which have been developed for these condi- tions. Dr. Cramer 's presentation will cover the current state of know- ledge on the safety of yoga both in clinical care and in everyday use.Presenters will also describe highlights of their own ongoing yoga re- search initiatives to further illustrate these concepts and approaches; and recent trends, developments and future directions for this fieldof research.Given its relatively low costs, yoga could easily be implemented worldwide as a preventive or therapeutic means for a variety of im- portant health conditions. As such, health-care providers are increas-ingly presented with patients using, or interested in trying, yoga forthe management of their medical conditions. This increased use of yoga raises the issue of the efficacy and safety of yoga as a preven- tion strategy and therapy. The symposium will present up-to-datescientific evidence on the prevalence and patterns of yoga use aswell as on the efficacy and safety of yoga for health conditions of global medical and socioeconomic importance. This information will promote evidence-based decision making on the clinical applicationof preventive or therapeutic yoga interventions. Gaps and openquestion in current research and implications for further studies will also be highlighted. The symposium thus aims to improve both clin- ical decision making and research quality on one of the most preva-lent complementary therapies used for the prevention and therapyof chronic health conditions. X2 The safety of yoga -a comprehensive review of clinical and epidemiological data Holger Cramer Department of Internal and Integrative Medicine, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, 45276, Germany BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): X2While yoga has long been viewed as a cure without harm, this view has been challenged in recent years. Mainly based on anecdotal evi- dence, the safety of yoga has been questioned in a number of lay-press articles. These publications seem to have led to a general un-certainty among yoga practitioners and those interested in starting practice. To address this issue from a scientific perspective, the results of asystematic review of case reports on yoga-associated injuries andother adverse events are presented. Systematic reviews as well as own studies on epidemiological data will also be reported, assessing data from more than 10,000 yoga practitioners. Large population-based surveys on associations of yoga practice with falls, injuries,and joint problems will be covered. Further, clinical data will be pre- sented in a meta-analysis on all available randomized trials on yoga reporting on safety-related data. In total, 94 trials with more than8,400 participants were analyzed.The available evidence shows that just as any other mental or phys- ical practice, yoga is indeed associated with certain risks of injuries and other adverse events. However, yoga appears just as safe asother forms of exercise. Between one in four and one third of yogapractitioners have been injured or suffered another adverse event due to their yoga practice; however most were mild and transient. Given that yoga has been shown effective for a number of condi-tions and risk constellations, there no need to discourage yoga prac-tice for healthy people or those with underlying physical or mental ailments. X3 Effects of integrative medicine on purinergic signalling and on theautonomous nervous system - implications for the treatment ofanxiety and Dominik Pain Centre, University of Munich, Munich, Germany;2German Medical Association for Acupuncture (D\u00c4GfA), Munich, Germany;3Autonomic Neuroscience Centre, University College Medical School, London, NW3 2PF, United Kingdom;4Institute of Physiology, University of 1): X3 This session presents the scientific underpinnings of the mind -body connection documenting the numerous interactions of the periph-eral, autonomous and central nervous system. First, this session willprovide important background information about how these systems profoundly impact human functioning, and how this can be modu- lated on different levels by techniques like acupuncture, neuralther-apy, meditation, relaxation techniques and movement therapies.Second, it will be assessed how this knowledge can be translated into daily practice to achieve long term effects in chronic pain and anxiety disorders.Strategies using a patient-centered approach will be presented forgroup treatment as well as in an individualized setting. Speakers will demonstrate that desensitization, somatic awareness, understanding, respect, discipline, empathy and patience are the basic principles ofa successful treatment. X4 2017, serious experiences regarding conference 'and session 'organ- izing and have chaired and held sessions at several conferences, inBMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 13 of 165the field of complementary medicine as well as in gastroenterology and internal medicine. I have published numerous articles in the field of gastroenterology, conventional and complementary. Integrativegastroenterology can be considered my field of expertise, witnessedby several trials and publications. I am the director of the department for integrative gastroenterology with special focus on patient care and clinical as well as basic research. I am the expert in the field forcomplementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and psychosomaticmedicine in Inflammatory bowel diseases for the German Society of Gastroenterology (DGVS). I am capable of organizing this session in an intelligent and forward fashion. The invited speakers demonstrateoutstanding experience in high quality research in integrative gastro-enterology on an international level. They have all been attending or organizing conferences in the past and are well recognized and lead- ing experts in the field of integrative gastroenterology. We expectthis session to be a success.Synospis There is a huge interest of the public in an integrative approach implementing complementary treatment approaches into gastro-enterology; however evidence for the efficacy and safety of comple-mentary therapies is still sparse or of lower quality in various fields leading to dissatisfaction among patients and practitioners. During the past years several trials and reviews have been conducted in-creasing the evidence base for integrative gastroenterology. ChineseMedicine has a long history in the treatment of digestive disease and with faecal microbiota transfer an old therapy strategy with a long history in medicine is gaining more and more attention at the mo-ment. This is based on the enormous interest in the scientific field ofthe microbiome where fascinating interactions between the mind and the microbiome have been proposed. The purpose of this symposium is to present recent clinical trials, sys-tematic reviews and basic research on complementary and alterna-tive therapies with the focus on Chinese Medicine, faecal microbial transfer and the mind-gut axis. The presenters, coming from three different continents, will not only provide the most recent develop-ments in the field of integrative gastroenterology, but also point outblind spots of current research in order to direct future research for the best possible patient care. The presenters will further describe highlights of their own ongoing research initiatives in the field of in-tegrative gastroenterology. The session will consist of three talks. X5 Yoga for weight loss and weight control -a critical review of research findingsRomy LaucheAustralian Research Centre in Complementary and Integrative Medicine(ARCCIM), University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, 2007, Australia BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): X5 The rates of overweight and obesity have reached epidemic propor-tions worldwide, with nearly two in three people in Germany, Australia and the United States classified as overweight or obese. A large percentage of complementary medicine interventions specific-ally target overweight and obesity, and as such it is not surprisingthat weight loss is one of the most frequently stated reasons for many CM practices including yoga. Yoga is in fact regularly adver- tised as the magic remedy for weight management in public yet alack of quality research has been identified to fully understand therole of yoga in weight management, from public health and clinical perspectives. The aim of this presentation is to evaluate latest research on the as-sociations of yoga with dietary patterns, body weight, body imageand eating disorders, and methods to lose or control weight; to summarize findings from clinical trials and systematic reviews; and to discuss directions for future research needed to establish a scientificfoundation for the use of yoga in overweight and obesity.X6 Evidence-based assessment of integrated care for pain -how do we best integrate different outcomes, to understand the effects of integrated care?Tobias Sundberg, Torkel Falkenberg IC-The Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): X6 Brief summary The overall aim of this session is to present and inform inter-national stakeholder perspectives and expert opinions on inte- grating different outcomes in the evaluation of integrated care, i.e. the evidencebased assessment of integrated healthcare inter-ventions for pain.Timeline (90 minutes) 1) A panel of researchers and stakeholders will share their expert perspectives, experiences and opinions about the integration of outcomes in the assessment of integrated pain rehabilitation interventions. (45 min) 2) The audience is invited to contribute to the discussion sharing their views of integrated outcomes for integrated care via a panel dialogue, possibly complemented by means of small group participatory \"think tanks\". (30 min) 3) The session will finish by summarizing the proposed \"best\" outcomes to be integrated and used in the evaluation of integrated care for pain. (15 min) Why this session deserves to be in the program The impact of bringing together expert opinions from key stake- holders including research and industry leaders to summarize scien- tific outcomes for evidence-based assessment of integrated painrehabilitation is anticipated to be of high importance contributing toimproved understanding of the use of integrated outcomes in inte- grated care for pain in clinical practice and research. Additionally, it is the organizers' intention that this session will contribute with infor-mation and outcomes to inform a subsequent report. Importantly, to-gether with data from a literature review, this session may contribute with information to a proposed \"toolbox\", i.e. a document that can be used by different stakeholders for informing relevant evidence-based assessments of healthcare interventions with a special em-phasis on integrating multiple outcomes in the evaluation of inte- grated care for pain. The audience will 1) Gain international stakeholder perspectives and expert opinions on the integration of outcomes in the evaluation of integratedcare for pain. 2) Gain knowledge about clinical and research based outcomes for evidence-based assessment of integrated care for pain. 3) Take home ideas and hypothesis with relevance for clinical practice and future research in the area of integrated care for pain. Clinical care X7Implementation of integrative medicine in a german pediatrichospital setting -clinical realization of complementary and alternative treatment approachesCatherina AmarellKinderkrankenhaus St. Marien, Landshut, Complementary Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 14 of 165Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) can support and amplify traditional therapies, especially in children. However, they are barely being used in in-patient treatment. The children 's hospital St. Marien initialized a responsible use of CAM as part of a modelproject. Over the past years, CAM methods were integrated into routine pediatric care of the hospital in in-house and outpatient treatments.Complementary treatments are not only provided for acute illnesslike upper airway nfections, headache or abdominal pain but are also offered as a supportive treatment to children with chronic illnesses. The clinical implementation of these treatments was undertaken inclose collaboration of all healthcare professionals (nurses, physiother-apists, doctors, etc). Different modalities were implemented, using methods of acupres- sure, relaxation techniques, herbal medicine, wraps and poulticesand aromatherapy.Regular in-house trainings led to broad knowledge and embedding of different techniques in all therapeutic areas. One important pillar of implementation is the education of parents.Parents are regularly involved in the implementation process, receiv-ing guidance on how to apply CAM and also receiving informational material informing them of possible complementary treatments as well as recommended life style changes for their children. X8 Update on pediatric integrative medicine -three main topics - upper airway infections Catherina Amarell Kinderkrankenhaus St. Marien, 2017, 17(Suppl 1): X8 Upper respiratory tract infections (URI) are very common among chil-dren and account for a majority of visits to pediatric clinics. A smallchild suffers from about 6-10 URIs per year. They are usually mild,90% viral and self-limiting, however the symptoms can cause irritabil- ity, fever and great discomfort- both for the child and the parents. Antibiotic treatment is not necessary in uncomplicated URI episodes.Over the counter medicines ( conventional \"and complementary products) are widely used, but many of them are not effective (or: evidenced based) and can even cause a variety of side effects, par- ticularly in very young children.In this part of the symposium an update will be given on integrativeapproaches of treatment strategies for URIs by taking into account not only current evidenced based treatments to shorten the duration and reduce symptoms, but also taking a closer look at home remed-ies, dietary changes, supplements and lifestyle changes. X9 Update on pediatric integrative medicine -three main topics - chronic headachesMelanie AnheyerElisabeth Krankenhaus Essen, Essen, BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): X9 Headaches are one of the most common pain conditions in children.The worldwide prevalence is estimated about 58.4%, with an increas-ing incidence during the last years. The classification of headache for children and adolescents as well as for adults is defined by the Inter- national headache Society and published in the International Classifi-cation of Headache Disorders III (ICHD-3). The most commonheadache types in childhood are migraine and tension-type head- aches. Both types are generally associated with a reduction of overall quality of live and a high frequency of school absence.This part of the session will give an overview of the current evidencefor integrative treatment options of primary chronic headaches in children and adolescents. On this occasion especially mind body therapies, acupuncture, herbal medicine and nutritional supplementswill be taken into account.X10 Implementation of integrative medicine in a german pediatric hospital setting -development of a concept and steps towards realizationMarion Eckert (dr-eckert@t-online.de) Kinderkrankenhaus St. Marien, 2017, 17(Suppl 1): X10 Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) has not been sys-tematically institutionalized in the pediatric care so far. Therefore it is often used without the knowledge of the attending pediatrician andcompartmentalized mostly into the outpatient care.For the responsible implementation and systematic evaluation of complementary medicine in pediatric care a model project \"Integra- tive Pediatrics -implementation of naturopathic and complementary medicine in pediatrics \"was initialized in 3 different pediatric hospi- tals in Germany, one of them being the \"Kinderkrankenhaus St. Mar- ien\"Landshut. Within this project we started to implement CAM Methods in the pediatric routine care of the hospital and the out- patient setting. A concept of the implementation process has beendeveloped based on clinical care, teaching and scientific evaluation. The concept and the main steps which lead to successful implemen- tation will be presented and individual speakers will introduce theaudience into selected treatment modalities implemented and scien-tifically evaluated over the period of one year. X11 Update on pediatric integrative medicine - three main topics - functional abdominal painMarion Eckert 1, Mercedes Ogal2 2017, 17(Suppl 1): X11 Abdominal pain is a common complaint of many children. Accordingto the KiGGS study up to 69% of all 3- to10-year old children andabout 60% of all children age 11-17-years complain about abdominalpain over the period of 3 months. The entity of functional abdominal pain is considerd to make for about 8% percent of abdominal pain episodes in children. It is characterized and defined as ROME III cri-teria and many times difficult to diagnose and treat.Many children undergo numerous diagnostic tests and sometimes painful procedures before the diagnosis functional abdominal pain is made. The ROME III criteria were developed to avoid unnecessarydiagnostic tests and help facilitate the diagnosis.It still is challenging to treat and give the children strategies to deal with their pain. In this part of the symposium we will focus on giving an update onthe current evidenced based treatment strategies in conventional medicine \"and also focus on evidenced based integrative approaches for functionel abdominal pain in different treatment settings. X12 Implementation of integrative medicine in a german pediatrichospital setting -concept and realization using the example of the Kinderkrankenhaus St. Marien, Landshut Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): X12 Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) has not been sys-tematically institutionalized in the pediatric care so far. Therefore it isoften used without the knowledge of the attending pediatrician. TheBMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 15 of 165growing interest amongst users as well as therapists leads to an in- creasing need of information about safety and efficacy for the CAM methods used.For the responsible implementation and systematic evaluation ofcomplementary medicine in pediatric care a model project Integra- tive Pediatrics -implementation of naturopathic and complementary medicine in pediatrics was initialized in 3 different pediatric hospitals in Germany, one of them being the Kinderkrankenhaus St. MarienLandshut. Within this project we started to implement CAM Methods in the pediatric routine care of the hospital and the outpatient set- ting. A concept of the implementation process has been developedbased on clinical care, teaching and scientific evaluation. The mainsteps which lead to successful implementation will be presented and individual speakers will introduce the audience into selected treat- ment modalities implemented over the period of one year. The mo-dalities presented will be methods of TCM, relaxation techniques,foot reflexology, wraps and poultices, aromatherapy and homeop- athy. Other modalities implemented are yoga and herbal medicine. To evaluate the implementation process a survey of expectations,knowledge and usage of CAM among patients and the medical staffwas performed at the onset of this project. Also qualitative and quantitative data of this survey will be presented to the audience. X13 The anthroposophic-medical approach to the treatment ofinsomnia, other Medicine Anthroposophic medicine (AM) is an integrative multimodal treat-ment system based on a holistic understanding of disease and treat-ment. It is building on a concept of four levels of formative forces in nature and on the model of a three-fold human constitution. AM is practiced by conventionally-trained physicians, therapists and nurseswho have undergone additional, specialized training, learning toapply a broad array of effective natural medicines. This whole-person approach also incorporates art, music, movement (eurythmy), and massage therapies as elements of a multidisciplinary health care.More than forty percent of all adults suffer adverse health effectsfrom perceived stress, e.g. insomnia; about seventy-five percent of all doctor's office visits are for stress-related complaints. Stress playing also a role in problems such as headaches, high blood pressure, dia-betes, asthma, arthritis, depression and anxiety is mainly a hazard ofthe workplace which costs the industries worldwide several hundreds of billions Euro annually. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a mental disordercharacterized by problems paying attention, excessive activity, or dis-ruptive behavior. Despite being the most commonly studied mental disorder in children, the exact cause is unknown in the majority of cases. ADHD treatment varies by country and usually involves somecombination of counseling or behavioral therapy, lifestyle changes,and medications. The anthroposophic-medical approach to stress-related complaints, exemplified in this symposium by insomnia and other diseases, in-clude counseling with regard to behavioral changes (daytime andsleep hygiene adapting to an individual circadian rhythm, inner spir- itual sleep preparation e.g. with a review of the day, meditation or prayer), external applications (lower leg and foot embrocation) e.g.with lavender oil or cuprum ointment, and as Bryophyllum pinnatum, potentized Phosphorus, Avena sativa combinations, possibly such as Neuro- doron\u00ae or Cardiodoron\u00ae from Weleda AG. Similar approaches to themanagement of ADHD will also be presented and discussed.X14 Advancing the science and care of integrative oncology around the worldJun Gustav Dobos4 1Integrative Medicine Service, Memorial Sloan Cancer Center, New York, USA;2Institute for Complementary and Integrative Medicine, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland;3Clinical Cancer Center in Xiyuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing,China;4Complementary and Integrative Medicine, Clinic for Internal and Integrative Medicine, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, GermanyCorrespondence: Jun J Mao BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): X14 Advances have been made in research to develop evidence and im-prove clinical delivery of integrative onoclogy care. In this inter-national symposium, the speakers will discuss the current status ofclinical care delivery in North America, Europe, and Asia. In addition, this international group of physician scientists will discuss their own research in the areas of acupuncture, mind-body medicine, andherbal medicine for cancer care. Following their talks, they will en-gage the audience to discuss how to increase collaboration to ad- vance the science and care of integrative oncology around the world. X15 From communication to integration -consultations about complementary medicine in cancer care Miriam Oritz 1, Markus Horneber2, Petra Voi\u00df3 1Institute for Social Germany;2Oncology, 1): X15 This session will give an overview about how to effectively communi-cate with patients (and relatives) about complementary medicine inroutine oncological care. Four talks will be provided on: /C15Needs and expectations: a patient 's perspective /C15Tasks and topics for the health professionals: casepresentations /C15Consultation service: results of a collaborative research project /C15Implementation strategies: international perspective onconsultation models After the session the audience will /C15Be able to understandthe oncological patients`perspective /C15Know about special communication about models for implementing integrative oncology in practice X16Implementation of integrative medicine in a german pediatric hospital setting -integration of foot reflexology as one pillar of an integrative treatment approach for hospitalized children Birgit ReisenbergerKinderkrankenhaus St. Marien, 2017, 17(Suppl 1): X16 Direct involvement of parents in the treatment of their sick child isvery important for the wellbeing of the child, the parents, as well asBMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 16 of 165for the staff involved in treating the child. Foot reflexology is a great means to accomplish this goal and an effective way to provide fast alleviation of symptoms in many cases. Out of the many indicationsfor the application of foot reflexology we chose two common ail-ments in children for which we offer this additional treatment modal- ity: abdominal pain and lung affections such as bronchitis. The parents are given teachings by physiotherapists and nursesapply certain techniques whilst caring for the children. Additionallyhandouts explaining the technique are provided. The aim is to offer parents and caretakers of the children a practical and easy way to al- leviate symptoms and activate self-regulating mechanisms in theirchildren in the hospital and at home.For scientific evaluation a study was initiated to investigate the ef- fects of the treatment. Questionnaires were developped to be filled in by the parents before and 2 weeks after the initiation of the inter-vention. Certain aspects of the parent 's stress level resulting from their child 's illness, as well as practicability, comprehension and ef- fectivity of the techniques used are assessed.So far there has been a very positive feedback and openness to thestudy and foot reflexology. It is perceived as an efficient help for thechildren and also as an emotional relief for the parents by lowering their own stress levels. X17 Up-date on integrative pediatrics Alexandra von Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): X17 The aim of this 90 minute symposium is to equip individual cliniciansand multidisciplinary teams with up-to-date knowledge of an integra- tive approach to manage common problems in pediatrics. For three pediatric key domains (1) chronic headache (2) functionalabdominal pain and (3) upper airway infections the latest scientificresearch and clinical expertise on integrative therapies in various age groups will be discussed by pioneers from 3 European countries. Culture-sensitive concepts and frameworks relevant for informed,shared decision making with families will be provided.This session also highlights successful strategies for incorporating in- tegrative pediatrics into conventional medicine set ups across Europe.

In hospitals as well as ambulant settings multimodal integrative oncology (IO) treatment options have been developed combining high quality provision of conventional cancertreatment with art therapies, movement therapies, eurythmy therapy and mind body interventions. In addition, therapeutic nursing inter- ventions, rhythmical massage, psycho-oncology and mistletoe treat-ment complement daily care. Based on guideline orientatedmedicine, central aspects are the individualized approach, the rela- tionship between professionals and patients, health related quality of life and patient orientation. Further development of academic struc-tures and research and exchange with other integrative concepts arefuture challenges. The World Congress of Integrative Medicine and Health 2017 (WCIMH) in Berlin, Germany provides the necessary plat- form to address these aspects of IO.MethodsIndividual aspects, concepts and clinical practice of IO in Anthropo- sophic healthcare will be subsequently deepened in a first WCIMH discussion panel consisting of physicians from European healthcareinstitutions which have successfully implemented and exercised IOconcepts. Results The panel provides recent data from various fields of IO and AM:clinical outcome of advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancertreated with standard and IO concepts in a certified cancer cen- ter, multimodal treatment concepts and perspectives of chronic fatigue in breast cancer patients, and spiritual needs of onco-logical patients. Furthermore, research and clinical approaches ofIO through the example of Swiss, Israeli and German hospitals and the implementation in AM concepts will be introduced and discussed.ConclusionAddressing academization and implementation of IO concepts in Anthroposophic healthcare a discussion panel of the WCIMH world congress 2017 was set up to deepen and discuss results of actualstudies, individual approaches, concepts and clinical practice in thisfield.

In the session, we will present: 1) Patient 's and health care providers 'perceptions of POA and its impact on patient-provider communication. We will contem-plate at anxiety within the broader bio-psycho-social-spiritual context of the patient 's health belief model. 2) We will also present a variety of CIM therapeutic perspectives on POA: Traditional Chinese Medicine (the \"Shen\" concept), Reflexology (4 elements theory), Hypnotherapy (fear of death, and nocebo effects). A hands-on experience will be given foreach modality, so that participants will be able to apply simpletechniques for relieving anxiety. 3) In addition, we will present findings from state-of-the-art re- search on CIM for POA related to obstetric, general surgery/anesthesia, and gastroenterology procedures.BMC Complementary Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 17 of 1654) Finally we will share our experience with thousands of patients at Bnai Zion Medical Center in preventing & treating POA. 5) Q&A Session will be interactive with audience mainly during the segment on therapeutic approaches. X20 Implementation of integrative medicine in a german pediatrichospital setting -homeopathy as one pillar of an integrative treatment approach for hospitalized children Annette Sch\u00f6nauer Kinderkrankenhaus St. Marien, Landshut, 2017, 17(Suppl 1): X20 Over the course of many years, there has been an increasing interestin the homeopathic treatment of children suffering from various ail-ments. Not only cough and the common cold, but also acute dis-eases such as pneumonia or severe chronic illnesses like rheumatism, asthma, etc. have been targets for a homeopathic supportive therapy.For more than 10 years we have been offering a consult service forthe homeopathic complementary treatment for various different dis- eases in the Kinderkrankenhaus St. Marien, Landshut \"with great success. The patients are treated with classical allopathic and evi- dence based treatment modalities and additionally a consult serviceconducted by a highly experienced homoepathic doctor is offered 24 hours a day. Inhouse teachings are given on a regular basis to the staff and treatment policies are provided on the intranet of thehospital.Patients and families as well as the medical staff highly welcome this additional possibility of treatment for the children. In a study per- formed in 2016, 80% oft he parents who have been offered the add-itional homeopathic treatment for their child accepted this optionreadily. For the staff a more comprehensive treatment of the whole child is made possible this way. An overview over the concept for the homepathic care, financingstrategies and benefits for the treatment of hospitalized children willbe given during this session.

More than half of all physicians in practice in the US,and residents in training in Canada, experience burnout, and this canlead to changes in the patient-provider relationship and can ad- versely impact on the quality of care. Some believe that this process begins with the decline in empathy and rise in cynicism seen duringmedical school and post-graduate training. In response, there is in-creased interest among faculty, adminstrators and policy makers to develop interventions with medical students, residents and faculty and provide them with tools to address the rise in chronic stress andburnout and the decline in resiliency. Keys to this work are themesof self-awareness and mindfulness and exploring domains of self- care and finding meaning in one 's work. At Georgetown University School of Medicine, a mind-body medicine skills course was devel- oped to provide opportunities for students, residents and faculty toexperience various mind-body techniques in a safe, confidential group setting. The program has now been adapted by a number of other institutions in the US and Europe.In this 90-minute session, representatives from 6 institutions(Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the US) who have implemented mind-body programs will share perspectives on the challenges they faced, the strategies they used to implement theprogram into the curriculum, the outcomes they obtained, and thelessons learned. The symposium will involve short (10) minute pre- sentations, which will enable at least a 30 minute discussion with the audience participants.By the end of the session, participants will be able to: 1. Describe of the challenges and barriers to implementation of a mind-body medicine program into the curriculum 2. Understand the strategies that facilitated the successful curricular implementation of mind body medicine programs 3. Delineate some of the outcomes that programs have reported in their students and faculty X22Promoting development in one self and others: educating for self-care and leadership in integrative health Haramati2, Diethard Tauschel1,3, of Witten/Herdecke, Witten Herdecke, Germany;2School of Medicine, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, United States;3Faculty of Health, University of Witten/Herdecke, Witten, Germany Correspondence: 1): Integrative Medicine and Health Care focuses on individual prefer-ences, needs and values of patients.

The aim of Kampo therapy is to improve patients condition whatever their diseases are. Kampo therapy is unique be-cause its focus is patients condition not their disease. Therefore,Kampo Medicine plays more and more important roles in closing the gap between modern modern medicine and demand of patients. It can be also used easily for cancer patient because it is operatedunder integrated universal health care by Japanese government. Pa-tients are diagnosed from both viewpoints of modern and Kampo medicine, and they are treated with the appropriate combination of both therapies. This characteristic suggests an ideal form of inte-grated medicine, where scientific and analytical approach of westernmedicine is integrated with holistic approach of Kampo Medicine. Though its origin was in ancient China, Kampo Medicine has been developed under the influence of Japanese nature and cul-ture, and nowadays is working as an independent medical systemsignificantly different from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). We would like to discuss on the advantage and disadvantage of Kampo medicine for cancer patients through some clinical re-searches and reports.According to four key objectives of WHO strategy, policy to integrate TM within national health care systems, establishment of the safety, efficacy and quality of TM, and preservation of the right of patientsto access TM. Japanese medical system might be a good example forcountries where traditional medicines are used.1. Provide some information on Kampo medicine through some clinical researches and case reports. 2. Discuss on the efficacy of Kampo medicine, Japanese medical system, and usage of Kampo medicine in cancer care. X25Phytotherapy in therapy and prevention: current state of scienceand regulation and perspectives of Kenny Rostock, Rostock, Germany; 4National Institute Japan 1): X25 Phytotherapy has been the basis of almost any Traditional Medicinefor ages. Appr. after 1850 and beginning in Europe, there has been increasing use of botanical, pharmaceutical and later pharmaco- logical scientific efforts to guarantee delivery of phytotherapeuticalproducts of highest quality and to evaluate their use in therapy aswell as to a smaller part also in preventive medicine for a variety of medical conditions. Today, phytotherapy is well regulated in coun- tries with Western standards of drug regulation. We overlook a num-ber of clinical trials of any type as well as reviews and systematicreviews. Traditional use of phytotherapy esp. as teas or decocts, still is around. The purpose of this symposium is to present different dimensions onthe state of the science on the application of phytotherapy in ther-apy and prevention. Presenters will review scientific research on utilization, efficacy, and safety of phytotherapy for the general popu- lation as well as for selected patient samples with specific mental orphysical conditions. One example will be the current state of know-ledge on the use of phytotherapy for therapy and prevention of in- fectious diseases, esp. urinary tract in and airways infections. Kampo medicine in Japan is a very good case to study its implemen-tation into the Japanese public health system. Presently, freeze-driedgranules of 148 traditional prescriptions are covered by public health insurance in Japan. One of these is Yokukansan, a novel phytothera- peutic preparation for the treatment of neuronal disorders on thebasis of traditional Japanese Kampo medicine.Given its relatively low costs, phytotherapy could easily be imple- mented worldwide as a preventive or therapeutic means for a variety of important health conditions. As such, health-care providers are in-creasingly presented with patients using, or interested in trying, phy-totherapy for the management of their medical conditions. This increased use of phytotherapy raises the issue of the efficacy and safety of phytotherapy as a prevention strategy and therapy.Gaps and open question in current research and implications for fur-ther studies will also be highlighted. The symposium thus aims to im- prove both clinical decision making and research quality on one of the most prevalent complementary therapies used for the preventionand therapy of chronic health conditions.Given its relatively low costs and so far good safety records, phy- totherapy should be implemented on a wider sale, as is also sug- gested by WHO with its quest for broader acceptance andunderstanding of Traditional Medicines.

Medicine and arts X27 Therapeutic recitation in anthroposophic therapeutic speech: physiological and psychological interactions of respiration, pulse and well-beingD BoninGTM, Anthroposophic Therapeutic Speech, Bern, Switzerland Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): X27 ObjectivesIn two studies we investigated cardiorespiratory synchronization in healthy subjects during (simultaneous effects) and after (immediate effects) recitation of ancient verse (Hexameter, H/Alitteration A), con-trolled and spontaneous breathing (C and S) as well as random con-versation (R). Cardiorespiratory synchronization was analyzed with respect to the oscillations in heart rate induced by respiration, i.e. re- spiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and a respiratory trace. Ancient verse(e.g. Hexameter) is used frequently in Anthroposophic Speech Ther-apy ATS, and effects of stress reduction and improved breathing have been attributed to its therapeutic application. MethodsSimultaneous effects study20 healthy subjects were included in the study. Each subject had to perform three different exercises in the following sequence: 15 min. sitting - 20 min. walking and exercise - 15 min. sitting .The exercises were: Hexameter exercise (H), Controlled breathing (C), Spontaneousbreathing (S). Immediate effects study 7 healthy subjects were included in the study. Each subject had toperform three different exercises in the following sequence: 15 min.sitting (S1) - 30 min. walking and exercise - 15 min. sitting (S2). To ensure comparable levels of physical activity during the exercises, the subjects walked at a pace of 50 steps/min. The exercises per-formed were: Hexameter exercise (H), Alitterative verse (A), Randomconversation (R). The participants were asked to comment on mood- changes in free text. ResultsSimultaneous efffects study [1] In total 180 recordings were analysed. All exercises showed an in- crease in heart rate, whereas heart rate always decreased after exer- cise as compared to baseline. The hexameter exercise showed thehighest heart rate (mean 82.9/min.). Cardiorespiratory synchronisa-tion was high after hexameter recitation ( = 0.70), less after con- trolled breathing ( = 0.57) and desynchronized after spontaneous breathing ( = 0.15). Immediate effects study [2] In total 105 recordings were analyzed. The overall binary pattern predominance (PP) as well as the frequency of predominant and cyclically recurrent cardiorespiratory phase locking patterns werecalculated. Furthermore the changes of low and high frequencyheart rate variability. ATS provoked alterations in heart rate dy- namics which were different from those after control exercises and which persisted at least during 15 minutes followingexercise. References 1.

It focuseson the relationship and regulation of spirit and soul with the physical body and life forces. EYT expresses sound and rhythm which are transformed in specific movements. It is used for several quite het-erogeneous indications, which underlines the importance to examinemore closely its effectiveness. So far there are two systematic reviews on EYT effects in clinical set- tings. The 2008 review from B\u00fcssing et al., published in BMC Comple- mentary and Alternative Medicine, referred to 8 citations which met the inclusion criteria and indicated that EYT is a \"potentially relevant add-on in a therapeutical concept \". In 2015 L\u00f6tzke et al. published an updated systematic review in the Journal of Integrative Medicine and referred to 11 studies published since 2008. Most of these stud-ies described positives treatment effects with effect sizes ranging from small to large. The studies were heterogeneous according to the indications, study design, methodological quality, and outcomemeasures.A recent randomized clinical study by B\u00fcssing, Michalsen, Kr\u00f6tz et al., which was not included in the 2015 review, compared the efficacy of three active interventions, i.e., EYT, yoga and physiotherapeutic exer-cises (PhyE) in a group 270 persons suffering from chronic low backpain. The study had an eight week intervention and an eight week follow-up phase. All three interventions were similar effective to sig- nificantly decrease patients 'physical disability and pain perception, while SF-12 's mental health component increased. Here, EYT had a significant benefit compared to PhyE. Moreover, there were signifi- cant improvements of stress perception, life satisfaction and mood for yoga and EYT, which were not seen for patients receiving PhyE.Significant improvements of patients 'self-efficacy expectation were observed within the active intervention period only in the EYT group. Thus, with respect to the different 'levels 'of the human being, all three interventions were effective on the physiological level (pain and associated disability), yoga and EYT on the emotional level (psy-chological quality of life components), and EYT on the level of the 'inner self '(self-efficacy). This larger study showed that EYT can be a therapeutic option for patients with chronic low back pain compar- able to the 'gold standard 'PhyE - and similarly effective as Yoga which is already implemented in the US guidelines. In summary, EYT is an important and promising intervention already established in Anthroposophic Medicine, and worth of further re-search in conventional settings.

Within Anthroposophic Medicine Arts Therapies are therefore more than only a \"nice to have \".T h ed i f - ferent applied Arts Therapies are based on traditional approaches and modified by anthroposophically enhanced perspectives. Re-search results from speech therapy, music therapy, and eurythmie therapy give evidence for the effectiveness of these special thera- peutic approaches in Anthroposophic Medicine. Basic researchstudies and randomised controlled trials are accumulating, docu-menting the effectiveness of Arts Therapies for various patient groups. More comprehensive research is necessary but the first findings are promising. X30 Research in arts therapies Sabine Koch 1, Harald Gruber1, Urs Pohlmann1, Christine Caldwell2, Barbara Krantz3, Ria 1Research Arts Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): X30 Art Therapy, Music Therapy, Dance Movement Therapy, Drama Ther- apy and Poetry Therapy together form the field of Creative Arts Ther-apies (CATs) and are mainly applied in mental health contexts.Recently they have also expanded into work and research on neuro- logical and cardiovascular diseases as well as prevention, where they have been found to significantly reduce stress and to enhance theparent-infant relationship. In palliative care, art, music and dancemovement therapy have been shown to reduce pain, anxiety and de- pression for cancer patients; for patients suffering from Parkinson 's disease they have been shown to increase quality of life. Yet in many areas, research needs to be expanded, enhanced and deepened asto what specifically works in arts therapies. How can we investigate active factors and mechanisms? How can we apply psychophysio- logical measures for the benefit of the field? This symposium pro-vides an overview of existing empirical evidence, research findings,and directions in Creative Arts Therapies. (4 presentations; 90 Minutes) 1.

However many clinicians still find Cochrane reviews intimi-dating and difficult to translate into the setting of clinical decision-making. One reason for this gap is a lack of clear understanding among health care providers of the specific methodology and tools that Cochrane reviews rely on to arrive at their conclusions. In par-ticular, the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias \u2014which forms the core of the Cochrane strategy for assessing the methodological qual- ity of clinical trials included in a review, and contributes to the over- all assessment of the quality of the evidence stemming from thereview \u2014is not well understood by most clinicians, educators and even researchers. The Cochrane risk of bias tool has been updated by Cochrane methodologists and will be presented to the Cochrane community in late 2016. This workshop provides an opportunity tobring the latest methodological advances in this area to integrativemedicine clinicians, educators, and researchers. This hands-on workshop will provide an overview of the risk of bias tool, followed by a supervised practice session in which participantswill work through the process of evaluating an article using the tool.This first-hand experience in utilizing the risk of bias tool will equip participants to feel more confident in understanding and using Cochrane reviews, and demonstrate how they themselves could par-ticipate as a Cochrane reviewer if they are interested.The workshop will consist of two parts: 1) Presentation We will introduce the participants to the Cochrane review processand how the risk of bias tool is used in Cochrane reviews. We will de-scribe the components of the updated tool and how each domain of risk of bias is to be assessed. 2) Hands-on experienceWe will supervise the participants in working through an article de-scribing an integrative medicine clinical trial, and applying the risk of bias tool to the trial. At the end of the hands-on session, we will re- view the risk of bias assessments and answer any questions aboutthe concepts or their application. W2 How to develop clinical practice guidelines for integrative medicine part 1: assessing the quality of the evidence used to inform a recommendationYuqing Zhang 1,2,3, Lisa S Wieland4, John J Riva5,6 1Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics department, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada;2Michael G.

They play the crucial role of translating research findings into succinct clinically relevant recom-mendations to facilitate clinicians, patients and caregivers in makingclinical decisions. When developing evidence-based CPGs, trials, sys- tematic reviews and meta-analyses are some of the most common sources of evidence to inform evidence-based recommendations.Clinicians want to get a sense of how much they should trust under-lying evidence. However, the quality of the evidence depends upon many factors including the availability, biases, precision, and consistency of the underlying evidence. The quality of the evidenceobtained influences the confidence in effect estimates for each out-come underpinning CPG recommendations. The Grading of Recom- mendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach is a systematic and transparent method for summarizingthe quality of evidence for an outcome into simple phrasing forBMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 21 of 165clinicians. The formulation of evidence-based CPGs relies upon GRADE assessments of the evidence, and it is therefore important for CPG developers to understand how to use this approach. GRADE alsoallows clinicians, policy makers, and consumers to use reviews 're- sults and recommendations efficiently and reliably. This workshop will have two main components: 1) A learning component;We will introduce the participants to the GRADE approach for qualityappraisal developed by the GRADE working group in McMaster Uni- versity, Hamilton, Canada. We will describe why it is important to evaluate the quality of the evidence in the context of integrativemedicine Cochrane systematic reviews, the relevance of the GRADEapproach to clinicians, researchers and policy makers, GRADE 's objec- tives, and the five domains that are used to assess the quality of theevidence.2) A hands-on componentWe will provide an example based on an evidence profile of a re- search question of interest in integrative medicine. The participants will work in small groups, applying the concepts presented in thelearning section to this evidence.Participants will obtain the introductory skills to assess the quality of evidence for estimates from integrative medicine Cochrane system- atic reviews. This skill is important for understanding the conclusionsof a Cochrane-style systematic review, and essential for those whomay be considering carrying out a Cochrane-style systematic review. Participants will also master one of the crucial steps in developing evidence-based CPGs to make evidence-based integrative medicinerelated recommendations. Education W3Understanding and learning the skills to manage stress in hospitalresidents and medical facultyMichael Lumpkin 1, Emily Ratner2 1Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington DC, USA; 2Medstar Health, Columbia, Maryland, USA Correspondence: Michael and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): W3 Numerous studies show that hospital residents and medical/healthcare faculty suffer from excess stress, burnout, and loss ofempathy. To address the challenge of healing these healers so that they may better serve their patients and themselves, we will briefly highlight the current knowledge about the physiology ofthe stress response in the context of the mind-body connectionand describe the pathophysiolog ical consequences of chronic stress on residents and faculty. Having defined the problem, par-ticipants will learn through experiential practice how to more ef-fectively manage their own stress through the use of severalmind-body medicine techniques including guided imagery, medi- tation, and autogenic biofeedback. To enhance the impact and meaning of the experiential activity, a real-time, non-invasivemonitoring device will be provided to measure the result ofmindfulness practice. Timeline: Introduction and Goals-5 min; Experiential-15 min; Con-structing and Faculty to Adress Stress andBurnout-15 min; Experiential Session with Meditation and Biofeed- with Monitoring Device-25 min; Processing and Discussion- 10 min.The importance of such a session to the program is to promote thelong-term health and well-being of healthcare providers so that they may more effectively and reliably provide comprehensive healthcare to patients into the future.W4 Concepts of TCM education in China and Europe - what can we learn from each otherLiu Ping 1, Pei Sven Schr\u00f6der2 Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China;2HanseMerkur Center for TCM at the UKE, Hamburg- Eppendorf, Germany;3International Education College, W4 In China full academic education in TCM started 60 years ago is nowavailable throughout the country at universities and colleges on all levels including bachelor, master and PHD programs. After receivingtheir bachelor degree, students usually choose a specialization, eitheracupuncture/tuina or internal (herbal) medicine for their further studies. In Europe TCM is seen as an additive to Western medicine aftergraduation. Education programs started in the 1950th but are mainlynon-academical and organized by societies of physicians and practi- tioners. In Germany medical doctors can reach a postgraduate specialization degree for acupuncture, education on Chinese herbalmedicine is not regulated. Non-medical practitioners can receive alimited allowance for treatment. However, a few academical pro- grams at non-medical universities have been introduced recently in Europe.Based on 30 years of sistercityship the TCM University Shanghai andthe HanseMerkur Center for TCM at the University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf cultivated an active exchange on all aspects of TCM with frequent reciprocal visits, cooperative research projects, co-organized symposiums and reciprocal training for many years.Nowadays, many textbooks and classical texts are available in English language. Furthermore, chinese scientific articles increasingly provide an english abstract and more and more research on TCM is per-formed in western countries. Main differences in education can befound in didactic concepts. In China lectures are mainly teacher ori- ented with less interactive elements. In western countries, students demand modern teaching material, problem oriented learning anddiscussions. Chinese teachers expect exact repetition of textbookcontents, while western didactics pronounce context oriented learn- ing and transferal of information. However, transferal of information is only possible, if there is a basic understanding of facts and terms.One further difference is the evaluation of the PHD education. InChina, PHD studies are seen as a combination of further qualification in the specific field and the scientific thesis. In western countries more impact is put on the experiments, thesis and the following sci-entific publication. For the internationalization of TCM education,both educational systems have to be taken into account. Further- more, transfer of knowledge, exchange of teachers, harmonization of curricula and cooperative international projects are mandatory.To approve an educational academic cooperation in practice, Shang-hai and Hamburg are planing an academization of TCM education at a western medical university. The concept includes common teach- ing by chinese and german specialist in Hamburg as well as inShanghai; and common research projects for master and PHD theses.

Similar to Integrative Medicine, PAM embodies relief of suffering frompain, nutrition and other lifestyle recommendations, and mind-body stress reduction strategies to help people overcome anxie- ties that may hinder performance during high pressure situations.Musicians are predisposed to certain injuries such as musculoskeletaloveruse, nerve entrapment conditions, and focal dystonia. They may also experience stress-related psychological conditions. Barriers to care include affordability, access, and attitudes.This workshop/case conference session will introduce the audienceto the unique health needs of performing artists. Thorough history taking and pertinent physical exam may identify potential or existing performing-related conditions.

The ways in which we see, understand and respond to pa- tients, caregivers and colleagues are complex and often ineffect-ive due to missed cues, distractions and time constraints. If eachindividual and every situation is unique, how can we be certain that we convey the nuances of each case with clarity and preci- sion? Especially when time is of the essence? This workshop usesthe analysis of artworks, active sketching and expressive writingto teach participants how to look carefully, describe precisely and communicate directly -skills which transfer directly from the classroom to the clinic.

D2 The future of collaborative research on Isar, TU M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Complementary and Alternative Since finishing the EU-funded CAMbrella project -defined as a co- ordination action -no convincing organizational structure could be established yet to continue and further develop the network of Euro-pean CAM/IM research groups. The discussion should disclose thereasons for this development and compile new ideas for a modified strategy taking into account the needs and specific conditions of the research groups. The discussion should be fuelled by 3 short inputs:i) history of ISCMR European chapter (Weidenhammer), ii)BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 23 of 165experiences from the Canadian chapter (Boon), iii) organizational framework for networking provided by ISCMR (F\u00f8nneb\u00f8). This international meeting is an ideal platform to sort out the currentsituation, the need for networking and ideas for future strategies tofacilitate international collaborative CAM/IM research.

D4 The Practitioner Research and Collaboration Initiative:establishment and baseline data for the world 's largest practice- based research network in complementary healthcare Amie Steel 1, Jon Adams1, David Technology Sydney, Ultimo, Australia;2Office of Research, Endeavour College of Natural Health, Fortitude Valley, Brisbane City,4006, Australia Correspondence: Amie Steel PurposePractice-based research networks (PBRNs) are an infrastruc-ture which supports pragmatic research drawn from real-life clinicalenvironments. There has been a strong growth in PBRNs in recent years encompassing a wide range of health professions including in- tegrative medicine. The Practitioner Research and Collaboration Ini-tiative (PRACI) is the largest PBRN within complementary healthcarein that it encompasses fourteen (14) different complementary medi- cine health professions. MethodsAll CM practitioners with qualifications in the professional groups in-cluded in PRACI were invited to complete a workforce survey. Thoseinterested in joining PRACI were asked to provide contact details to link their results to a PRACI ID number. This data was used to form the foundation of the PRACI membership database.Results764 CM practitioners joined PRACI with the highest number of practi- tioners reporting qualifications in massage therapy (n = 447; 58.5%), naturopathy (n = 202; 26.4%), nutrition and 13.4%). The largest of PRACI members have apractice based in Victoria (34.7%), Queensland (24.6%) and New South Wales (22.8%) although members are also represented in all other States and Territories. The PRACI members reported diversepractice interest areas.Conclusions PRACI is a PBRN which affords the potential to support diverse re- search projects due to its innovative sub-study design. As a result,PRACI offers significant opportunity to facilitate economies of scaleand growth in CM research across a broad range of research areas. Traditional healing systems D5Statutory regulation of traditional and complementary medicineprofessionals: operationalizing the World Health Organization guidelines Heather Boon, of Toronto, Toronto, CanadaCorrespondence: Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): D5 The World Health Organization has called upon states to regulatepractitioners of traditional and complementary medicine (TCAM) sys- tems and therapies, and an increasing number of jurisdictions are taking steps to do so. However, to date, scholarship that addressesthe distinct complexities of TCAM professional regulation has beenscant. The objectives of this project were: 1) To explore the factors that distinguish TCAM professional regulation from that of biomed- ical health providers; and 2) to develop a public interest frameworkto guide TCAM professional regulation. Data collection included anextensive review of literatures reporting various jurisdictions\" ap- proaches to and experiences with regulating TCAM providers; and re- analysis of our research team\"s fifteen-year study of TCAMprofessionalization in Ontario, Canada which has included a multiplesets of qualitative interviews with front line TCAM practitioners and leaders, as well as a survey of all Chinese medicine, naturopathy and homeopathy practitioners in the Province (n = 1047). We found sev-eral features that differentiate TCAM professional regulation fromthat of biomedical professionals, including: contrasting epistemic frameworks and conceptualizations of evidence; traditional medi- cine\"s concurrent clinical and cultural importance; the internal diver-sity of traditional health care systems; and historically-situated,differential power relations between TCAM and biomedicine. Apply- ing critical theories of the professions as well as post-coloniality, we propose a principle-based framework for guiding TCAM professionalregulation across jurisdictions. Underpinned by the principle of regu-latory equity, our framework prioritizes traditional knowledge protec- tion alongside patient safety, quality of care, and accessibility. We discuss how these principles may be diversely interpreted and ap-plied across contexts, with respect to such specific issues as: profes-sional standards, linguistic regulatory requirements, and biomedical professionals\" increasing adoption of TCAM practices. D6 How to prioritise traditional treatments for further research,including clinical trialsMerlin Willcox, Michael Heinrich, George Lewith, Andrew Flower, Southhampton, Southhampton, United Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 24 of 165There are tens of thousands of traditional treatments used through- out the world, and limited resources for their evaluation, especially in clinical trials. To date, there have been no scientific guidelines onhow to prioritise which treatments should be researched in depth, in-cluding for clinical trials. We propose to present several ideas from different viewpoints, and to engage the audience in discussing how these ideas could be developed into guidelines to improve the effi-ciency of research on traditional medicines.Specifically we will have short presentations on the following approaches: 1. The need for consolidated standards on reporting ethnopharmacological research -Prof Michael Heinrich 2. Ethnopharmacological studies with diverging expections: why a consensus? -Dr Bertrand Graz 3. Novel methods for prioritising plants for further research -the \"RITAM score \"; and the \"Retrospective Treatment Outcome study \"-Dr Merlin Willcox 4. The \"5-phase model \"to define good practice -Dr Andrew Flower and Prof George Lewith Orals Research O1 Impact of acupuncture on medication use in patients sufferingseasonal allergic rhinitis -results of the ACUSAR Sylvia Binting, Benno for Social Epidemiology and Berlin, Berlin, 10117, Germany Correspondence: O1 BackgroundSeasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) is a common disease with diminishing effects on quality of life (Qol). An estimated 18% of the patients tryto alleviate their symptoms through acupuncture. The ACUSAR (ACU-puncture in Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis) study assessed the impact of acupuncture on SAR and showed significant improvements in rhinitis specific Qol (RQoL), SAR symptoms and the use of rescue medication(RM). We investigated patients use for antihistamines into moredetail. Methods Patients were randomised into three study groups: acupuncture plusRM, sham acupuncture plus RM and RM alone. They documentedtheir medication use before and during the intervention period (8 weeks). Main outcome were the days of antihistamine used. Statis- tical analyses were conducted using parametric and non-parametrictests. Robustness of the results was tested by sensitivity analyses.Results Data of 414 patients were analysed. Following results were deter- mined for the intervention period: The acupuncture group used anti-histamines on significantly fewer days than the other groups(acupuncture vs. sham acupuncture: mean difference = -4.49 days, p = 0.01; acupuncture vs. RM: mean difference = -9.15 days, p < 0.001). About 38% of the acupuncture group did not use any antihistaminecompared to only 16% in the RM group. Acupuncture patients didnot need to increase the days of antihistamine use to handle their symptoms in contrast to patients who used RM alone. ConclusionsBesides improving RQoL and SAR symptoms, acupuncture signifi-cantly reduces the use of antihistamines and can therefore be con- sidered as a valuable treatment option for SAR patients.O2Measuring existential qualities of patients' health and suffering - the first stages of instrument development Susanne Andermo PurposePatients may appreciate integrative care by its whole person and ex-istential approaches. However, such caring qualities can be difficult to measure. The aim of this Swedish study was to develop a first ver- sion of an instrument measuring patients 'experiences of health and suffering with an existential focus.Methods A methodological design with three phases for instrument develop- ment was used. First; an item pool was developed based on qualita-tive interviews (n = 64) from patients receiving integrative care.Subsequently the relevance of the items was explored in 2 iterative rounds of cognitive patient interviews (n = 5 and n = 3). Finally expert stakeholder consultations (n = 5), were used to further refine theinstrument.Results The first phase development of the instrument resulted in two inter- related dimensions: existential qualities of \"health\" and \"suffering\",characterized and \"Meaning\". Instrument items were formulated as word pairs on a semantic differential scale repre- senting opposite ends of a continuum. The cognitive patient inter-views and expert opinions helped to refine items and domains, butdid not change the overall instrument construct. Conclusions The dimensions and domains of this first version of the instrument,developed from a contemporary use of language, resemble well withtheories in caring science focusing on existential qualities of health and suffering as integral to human life. The instrument is anticipated to be of value for evaluations in research, development of integrativeand conventional health care practice as well as for theory develop-ment in caring science. O3 Epigenetics alterations associated with short-term relaxation response Institute for Mind Body Medicine, BIDMC, Harvard Medical School, Medicine, Boston, MA, United States;2Genomics, Proteomics, Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Center, Department ofMedicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School,Division of Interdisciplinary Medicine and Biotechnology, and Division of Interdisciplinary Medicine and Biotechnology, Boston, MA, United States; 3Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States;4Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United StatesCorrespondence: Manoj Bhasin BackgroundThe relaxation response (RR) is the physiological and psychological opposite of the fight-or-flight or stress response. The RR has been re-ported to be effective in a number of disorders that are believed tobe caused or exacerbated by stress. We had performed multiple gen- omics and systems biology studies in healthy and disease conditionsBMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 25 of 165to understand the molecular mechanism of RR. Our studies provided compelling evidence that the RR elicits specific gene expression changes linked to upregulation of energy production and insulin se-cretion, and downregulation of NF-kB mediated inflammation.Methods To explore further whether the beneficial effects of RR are associated with upstream epigenetic modifications (specifically, changes in DNAmethylation), we now report a pilot study on 6 healthy subjects be-fore and after 8 weeks of RR training. To identify RR-associated epi- genetic changes, we performed genome-wide bisulfite sequencing to measure methylation changes. We also carried out integrated ana-lysis of methylation and transcriptome data to identify molecular al-terations which affect both regulatory and transcriptional genomic spaces. ResultsComparison of pre- and identified 18,979significantly hypo- or hyper- methylated regions (Adjusted P value < .01), corresponding to hyper- and hypo- methylation of 1,033 and 1,587 genes, respectively. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed sig-nificant hypo-methylation of genes linked to: neuron and muscle celldifferentiation and development; lipid metabolism; mRNA processing and MAPK signaling. A similar analysis revealed hyper-methylation of multiple pathways, including: interferon gamma response; cell cycleregulation; and systemic lupus erythematosus.We also performed an integrated analysis of our epigenetic and gene expression data from a previous study of healthy subjects (n = 19). The comparison identified multiple pathways that significantly im-pacted both at the transcriptional and epigenetics Electrontransport chain signaling pathways had significant hypo-methylation and up-regulation at the gene expression levels, indicating a positive effect of RR on energy production, mRNA processing, GPCR ligandBinding and Epithelial Cell Differentiation pathways. Further analysis epigenetics and transcriptional data showed activa- tion of INSR, a key molecule in insulin signaling, indicating that RR may have a positive effect on glucose metabolism. Similarly, the ana-lysis indicated inhibition of the expression of IL6, a key cytokine asso-ciated with chronic inflammation, supporting the role of RR in downregulating inflammation. ConclusionThis pilot study provides a unique insight into how the RR effectsDNA methylation and gene expression of energy production, glucose metabolism and immune response pathways. O4 Prolonged fasting in T1DM -case study from patient perspective Bettina Berger 1, Rainer Michalsen2, David Witten/Herdecke, Filderstadt, Germany 1): O4 BackgroundFasting as a medical treatment has been proven to be a valuabletherapeutic method for chronic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome [1]. For patients with Type 1 Diabetes mellitus (T1DM), fasting therapies has neither been recom-mended nor excluded by fasting guidelines [2] and most fastingclinics do not accept people with T1DM for fear of ketoacidosis. The literature on fasting in T1DM is scarce and limited to fasting during Ramadan [3].AIMS: Report on a single case study of prolonged fasting in a T1DMpatient for about seven days. Methods A femal patient (age 49 y) suffering from T1DM for 39 years, decidedto fast on her own. Fasting during 7 days scheduled a reduction ofinsulin dosage from around 36 units short acting insulin and 18 units basal insulin/d to basal insulin only (18 units/d). The faster took water, tea, and vegetable broth only. She measured blood sugar leveldaily 10-12 times and took carbohydrates in case of blood sugar level below 60 mg/dl. She decided to measure ketone body daily and to take carbohydrate in case of uncertanty.ResultsFasting was performed during 7 days without any carbohydrate in- take. Only two times a mild hypoglycemia (treated with two units of carbohydrates) and two times a mild hyperglycemia (treated withfour units of short acting insulin) but no serious hypoglycemia orhyperglycemia, not ketoacidosis occurred. Glucose profil were bal- anced between 60 and 180 mg/dl, av. 150 mg/dl during the whole time. The patient felt very well.ConclusionTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report on pro- longed complete fasting in T1DM. It indicates that persons with Type 1 diabetes can participate safely in prolonged fasts provided they re-duce their usual insulin dose and carefully supervise their bloodsugar level. Interventional studies are needed on the effects of fast- ing on metabolism, quality of life and longevity. Literatur1. Michalsen A, Li C.

Methods A pragmatic, randomized controlled trial was carried out in six hospi-tals in de Netherlands. Children (age 9-18 years) with primary head-ache and headache attack frequency of 2 times per month were randomized to receive either hypnotherapy or TM or regular relax-ation exercises (control group), in addition to usual medical treat-ment. Primary outcome were mean frequency of primary headacheattacks and clinically relevant (>50%) reduction in headache fre- quency, after three months of intervention. Secondary outcome was subjective improvement in symptoms (adequate relief).Results112 children were included: hypnotherapy (N = 39), TM group (N = 36) and control group (N = 37). Mean age was 13.3 years and 77% was female. Preliminary analysis were performed and showed thatheadache frequency was significantly reduced after 3 months for allgroups from 18 to 13 days with headache per month (p = 0.0001). No significant differences were found between the groups (p = 0.95). The percentage of children with clinically relevant reduction in head-ache attacks was 38% and did not significantly differ between thethree groups. Subjective improvement after intervention (adequate relief) was reported by 30% of children, with no significant difference between groups, although there was a positive trend for hypnother-apy (38,5% versus 25% in TM and control group, p = 0.34). No ad-verse events were reported.

O6 Cupping in chronic low backpain Binting, Fabian Lotz, Stephanie RollInstitute for Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Berlin, 10117, Germany Correspondence: O6 BackgroundCupping is used frequently in chronic low back pain (cLBP) although its effectiveness is not clear. The study aim was to investigate the ef-fectiveness of pulsatile cupping in cLBP.Methods cLBP patients were randomly allocated to 1) pulsatile cupping (8 treatments), 2) minimal cupping (8 treatments) or 3) a control group.All groups received paracetamol on demand. Patients in both cup-ping groups were blinded in regard to which cupping they received. Primary outcome was the pain intensity measured with the VAS (0- 100 mm) after 4 weeks. Secondary outcomes included back functionmeasured with the Funktionsfragebogen Hannover R\u00fccken (FFbH-R)and paracetamol intake. Results A total of 110 patients were randomized to pulsatile cupping (n =37), minimal cupping (n = 36) and control group (n = 37). The meanadjusted (for baseline values) VAS pain intensity after 4 weeks for the pulsatile cupping group was 34.9 for control group (group dif-ferences: cupping vs. control 0.001); minimal 0.001); pulsatile cupping vs. minimal cupping (p = 0.225)). After 12 weeks VAS pain intensity was significantly lower for pulsatile cup- ping vs. control (-15.1 (3.1;27.1); p = 0.014), but not for minimal cup-ping bet- ter than (p = 0.045) control for back function after 4 weeks, but not after 12 weeks (p = 0.088). Minimal cupping was not significant betterthan control after 4 and 12 weeks. Paracetamol intake did not differsignificantly between the groups. Conclusion Both forms of cupping were efficacious in patients with cLBP after4 weeks. However only pulsatile cupping showed significant effectscompared to control in some outcomes after 12 weeks. O7 Developing an integrative treatment program for cancer-relatedfatigue Witt1 1Institute for Complemetary and Integrative Medicine, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland;2Department of oncology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland;3Department of radiation oncology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland;4Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; 5Patient and member of the stakeholder advisory board, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland;6Cancer League Ostschweiz, St. Gallen, SwitzerlandCorrespondence: fatigue (CRF) has gained increased attentionin the past decade, it remains difficult to treat. An integrative ap-proach combining conventional and complementary medicine (CM) interventions seems promising. Treatment programs are more likely to be effective if the needs and interests of the people involved arewell represented. This can be achieved by stakeholder engagement.Objectives The aim of the study was to develop an integrative CRF treatment program using stakeholder engagement and comparing it to anexpert's version.Method In a qualitative study a total of 22 stakeholders (4 oncologists, 1 psycho-oncologist, 1 radiation-oncologist, 5 nurses/nurse experts, 9patients, 1 patient family member, 1 representative of the Swiss Can-cer League) were interviewed either in a face-to-face or in a focus group setting. For data collection and data analyses the method of qualitative content analyses was used.ResultsThe stakeholder engagement resulted in an adjustment to the indi- vidual and real-life situations and in a request for highlighting inter- ventions where patients can be active. Compared to the expert'sversion which had all intervention options on the same level, thestakeholder engagement resulted in a program with 3 different levels. The first level includes non-pharmacological mandatory inter- ventions, the second non pharmacological choice based interven-tions and the third pharmacological interventions for severe CRF.Conclusion By adopting the approach of stakeholder engagement, we integrated the needs and preferences of people who are directly affected byCRF. This resulted in an integrative CRF treatment program withgraded recommendations for interventions and therefore with a higher potential to be sustainable in a usual care setting. O8 Patient perceptions of group and individual acupuncture in anurban, underserved, primary care settingElisabeth Chuang 1,2, Ben Kligler1, Melissa D McKee1,2 1Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Department of Family and Community Medicine, Brooklyn, New York, NY, United States;2Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Family and Social Medicine, Bronx, NewYork, NY, United States Correspondence: Ben Kligler 1): O8 QuestionWhat are the perceptions of patients from an ethnically diverse, urban, underserved population on the experience of acupuncture forpain in the individual setting vs. the group setting?Background In March 2015, the Acupuncture Approaches to Decrease Disparities in Pain Treatment (AADDOPT-2) trial, a two-arm comparative effect-iveness trial, was launched to assess whether acupuncture for chronicpain delivered in a group setting is as effective as individual acu- puncture in an underserved and ethnically diverse patient population at risk for health disparities. The trial has recruited 512 of a projected700 patients and will conclude in late 2017. A second objective ofthe AADDOPT-2 trial was to use qualitative analysis to better under- stand the patient experience of both individual and group acupuncture.MethodsSemi-structured open-ended interviews were conducted with 20 par- ticipants in each study arm. The interview guide was created through interactive process including research team members and patientstakeholders. Questions aimed to elicit patients 'pain narrative; ex- perience of acupuncture during sessions and social interactions; and perceptions of the outcomes of acupuncture. The sample was pur- posely selected for representation of both genders, all study sitesand patients with good and poor functional status. Interviews wereconducted by phone, audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Material was coded using Dedoose software and analyzed using a constant comparison techniqueBMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 27 of 165Results Patients in both study arms valued the pain relief, holistic approach and relaxation experienced during acupuncture. The relationshipwith the acupuncturist was described positively by patients in botharms, but with greater richness by patients in the individual arm. A minority of patients in both arms cited concerns about privacy and receiving acupuncture in mixed gender groups, however, patientswho were assigned to group acupuncture noted that being allowedto wear street clothing and acupuncturist efforts to maintain privacy assuaged their concerns. A small number of patients assigned to group acupuncture noted an ongoing feeling of vulnerability aroundbeing in pain due to needling in a public setting. A few patientsassigned to group acupuncture expressed that non-clinical physical environment gave them initial misgivings about the legitimacy of acupuncture treatments. Group dynamics varied; some groups fos-tered a supportive, therapeutic interaction between patients, whileothers were more reserved Conclusions There were important differences in the experience of acupuncturein the group vs. individual setting. Patients in both arms valued theiracupuncture experience. and group patients reported both positives and negatives regarding the group experience. O9 Yoga for women diagnosed with breast cancer -a systematic review and meta-analysisHolger Duisburg-Essen, Essen, 45276, Germany;2Research Center in Complementary and Integrative Medicine, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia Correspondence: Holger Cramer (h.cramer@kliniken-essen-mitte.de) O9 QuestionWhat are the effects of yoga on health-related quality of life, mentalhealth, and cancer-related symptoms in women diagnosed withbreast cancer? Methods This abstract is based on a draft and pre-peer review version of aCochrane Review. Upon completion and approval, the final version isexpected to be published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (www.cochranelibrary.com). The Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, IndMED, and CENTRALwere searched through February 2016 for randomized controlled tri-als (RCTs) assessing the effects of yoga on health-related quality of life, depression, anxiety, fatigue, or sleep disturbances in women di- agnosed with breast cancer. For each outcome, standardized meandifferences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.The quality of evidence was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the GRADE recommendations. ResultsTwenty-four RCTs on 2,166 women were included. Compared to notherapy, moderate quality evidence for short-term effects of yoga was found for health-related quality of life (SMD = 0.22; I2= 0%). Compared to psychosocial/educational interventions, moderate quality evidence for short-term effects on depression = I2= 0%) was revealed. No group difference compared to exercise occured. No serious adverse events were reported. ConclusionsModerate quality evidence supports the recommendation of yoga asa supportive intervention for women diagnosed with breast cancer. Very low quality evidence suggests that yoga might be equally ef- fective as other exercise interventions.O10 Acupuncture and related therapies for treating irritable bowel syndrome: overview of systematic reviews and network meta-analysisVincent CH Chung 1, Hoi LC Wong2, Xin YL Ching1, Justin CY Wu1 1Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, 999077 Hong Kong;2Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, 999077 Hong Kong Correspondence: Vincent CH 17(Suppl 1): O10 PurposeRecent clinical evidence has shown the effectiveness of acupunctureand related therapies for improving irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)symptoms. However, the relative performance among different types of acupuncture and related therapies is unknown. This network meta-analyses (NMA) was conducted to evaluate comparative effect-iveness of various acupuncture and related therapies.Methods Eight electronic databases were searched for SRs focusing on ran- domized controlled trials (RCTs) which investigated acupuncture andrelated therapies among IBS patients. Data from RCTs were extractedfor pair-wise meta-analyses. NMA was used to explore the most ef- fective treatment option. ResultsFrom 8 SRs, 132 RCTs (n = 10,694) assessing acupuncture and relatedtherapies were included. Result from pair-wise meta-analyses showed that acupuncture did not have significant beneficial effect on treat- ing pain and diarrhoea symptoms among IBS patients when com-pared with Pinaverium Bromide (an oral western medication). catgut embed- ding with Pinaverium Bromide demonstrated beneficial effects of various types of acupuncture on treating IBS overall symptoms (RR =1.35, 95%CI: 1.09 to 1.67, moxibustion; RR = 1.55, 95%CI: 1.11 to 2.17,electroacupuncture; RR = 1.55, 95%CI: 1.13 to 2.13, catgut embed- ding). Results from NMA of seven RCTS showed no differences on the comparative effectiveness among five types of acupuncture andrelated therapies, but moxibustion had the highest probability(68.2%) of being the best option for improving IBS overall symptoms. Conclusion The effectiveness of all acupuncture and relative therapies reviewedon treating IBS symptoms appeared to be similar, with moxibustionshowing the highest probability of being the best treatment on IBS. To confirm the effectiveness of moxibustion, well conducted, ad- equately powered trials are needed in the future.

ResultsPreliminary results show that there is significant improvement inpulse, respirations, level of comfort and well being following a pet therapy visit. ConclusionA dog pet therapy program in the hospital setting is beneficial to pa-tients in regards to their level of comfort and well-being. Further re- search is needed to determine if this program is beneficial to patients across other settings. O12 Acupuncture at acupoints may prevent risks of cardiovasculardiseases in migraine patients by reversing plasma glutamate and Epidemiology (AME), Munich, Germany;2Chengdu university of Tranditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China;3National Center of Biomedical Analysis, Beijing, ChinaCorrespondence: Zishan Gao 1): O12 QuestionThe efficacy difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture arise great debate in evidence-based medicine. The aim of the current study was to investigate the metabolomic evidence for theefficacy difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture intreating migraine by using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)- based metabolomic technology. MethodsWe recruited 60 migraine patients and 10 health adults. First, 1H-NMRexperiment and multivariate analysis were conducted to characterize metabolic profiling of migraine and potential biomarkers for migraine patients. Second, migraine patients were randomly assigned to specialacupoints group and non-acupoints group. Acupuncture treatmentwere accordingly practiced on these groups lasted for two sessions. 1H-NMR experiment was conducted, multivariate analysis and Ingenu- ity Pathway and network analysis (IPA) was used to identify functionchange and metabolic pathway difference between acupuncture atacupoints and acupuncture at non-acupoint in predicted protein- metabolomic network model of migraine. ResultsWe found that metabolic profiling of acupuncture at acupoints groupchange very similar to health adults as acupuncture treatment ses- sion increases. 6 metabolites including citrate, acetone, pyruvate, glu- creatine, LDL were significant reversed after 2 session ofacupuncture treatment. In contrast, metabolic profiling of non-acupoints group was clearly separated from health adults as treat- ment session increases. Only glutamate, a classic migraine biomarker, was significantly reversed after 2 session of treatment in acupunctureat non-acupoints group. Particularly, acupuncture at acupoints couldreverse novel cardiovascular biomarker- APOB ratios in predicted pro- tein- metabolomic network model, and also could significantly acti- vate lipid metabolism function and decrease amino acidsmetabolism function in predicted bio-function migraine model. How-ever, acupuncture at acupoints did not exhibit such effect in the pre- dicted protein-metabolic migraine model.ConclusionsOur data suggest acupuncture might exhibit non-specific effect on both acupoints and non-acupoints by decreasing plasma glutamatetherefore reliving migraine attack. However, acupuncture at acu-points may exhibit sustained effect on migraine by gradually reverse the metabolic profiling of migraine patients compared with acupunc- ture at non-acupoints. In particular, acupuncture at acupoint but notnon-acupoints may prevent risks of cardiovascular diseases in mi-graine patients by reversing both plasma glutamate and APOB ratio . O13 Effectiveness of leech therapy in treatment of chronic low back pain - a randomized controlled clinical studyChristoph D Complementary Medicine, Charit\u00e9 University, Berlin, Germany;2Department of and Psychotherapy, 17(Suppl 1): O13 Question Low back pain has a high relevance in means of prevalence and so-cioeconomic burden. This paper presents a clinical trial assessing theeffectiveness of medical leech therapyin chronic low back pain. Methods We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of leech therapy in chroniclow back pain. Forty-fourpatients with chronic low back pain whoscored > 40 mm since at least 3 months on a 100 mm VAS pain scale were randomized to a single treatment with 4-7 locally applied leeches (leech group) or a 28 day course with back exercise once aweek for one hour led by a physiotherapist. Primary outcome meas-ure was change of overall pain on the 100 mm VAS from baseline to day 28. Secondary outcomes were overall impairment (bothersome- ness) by pain (100 mm VAS), disability (Roland Morris Disability Scale,Funktionsfragebogen Hannover), quality of life (SF-36), and pain per-ception (SES). Patients were examined baseline and at days 28 and 56 after treatment. ResultsOverall pain score at day 28 was reduced from 61.23/-15.6 to33.74/-22.7 in the leech group (n = 25) and from 61.55/-14.76 to 60.44/- 17.52 in back exercise group (n = (mean group differ- ence -25.23; 95%CI -41.01 to -9.45; p effects were also observed for bothersomeness, disability,quality of life and pain perception. Results were not affected by outcome expectation. ConclusionsA single course of leech therapy is effective in relieving pain, improv-ing disability and quality of life for at least 2 months. Leech therapy is an effective option in the treatment of chronic low back pain. The study is registerd at german clinical trials register under identifierDRKS00004871. O14 Andrographis paniculata for symptomatic relief of acuterespiratory tract a systematic review and meta-analysisXiao-Yang Hu 1, Ruo-Han Wu2, Martin Logue1, Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China;3AgroParisTech, Paris Institute of Technology for Life, Food and Environmental Sciences, Paris, FranceCorrespondence: Xiao-Yang Hu (x.hu@soton.ac.uk); George Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 29 of 165Purpose This systematic review aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of A. paniculata for symptoms of acute RTIs. MethodsNine databases were searched from their inceptions to March 2016 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating oral A. Paniculata without language barriers. The primary outcomes were improvementin RTI symptoms and adverse reactions. Random effects model wasused to poolthe standardised mean differences and risk ratio to in- corporate heterogeneity with 95% CI reported. Methodological qual- ity was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias; 2 reviewersindependently screened eligibility and extracted data.Results Thirty-three RCTs (7175 patients) were included. Interventions in- cluded A. Paniculata as a monotherapy and as an herbal formula.Most trials evaluated A. Paniculata provided commercially but sel-dom reported manufacturing or quality control details. It showed sta- tistically significant effect in favour of A. Paniculata versus placebo (n = 445, SMD: -0.69, [-1.37, -0.89] for sore throat). Favourable effects were shown when compared A. paniculata to standard care, and other herbal in- terventions. No major AEs were reported and minor AEs were mainlygastrointestinal. The methodological quality of included trials werelimited. Conclusions A. Paniculata appears beneficial and safe for relieving RTI symptomsand shortening time to symptom resolution. The evidence is incon-clusive due to limited study quality and heterogeneity. Well-designed trials evaluating the effectiveness and safety of A. Paniculata are warranted. O15 Yoga in school sport - a non-randomized controlled pilot study inGermany including a qualitative evaluation Michael Hospital Berlin, Department of Internal and Complementary Medicine, 14109, Berlin, Germany;2Charit\u00e9 - University Medical Center, Germany 2017, 17(Suppl 1): O15 Question We aimed to evaluate potential effects of a 10-week yoga course asan alternative for regular school sport. Methods A cohort study design with an active control group (school sport)was implemented in two secondary schools. Primary outcome meas-ure was stress (CPS) from baseline to week 10. Secondary outcomes included depression/anxiety (HADS), attention (D2), quality of life (WHO-5), mood states (POMS) and VAS for general pain, neck pain,headache, fatigue and sleep quality. Outcome parameters wereassessed at baseline, at week 10, and at a 6-month follow-up. A per- protocol analysis using mixed linear models was performed. Further- more qualitative interviews in 3 focus groups with 6 participantseach were performed.Results 102 adolescents were screened for eligibility. 86 (53% female; mean age 20.2 \u00b1 2.3 years) were included into the study (50 participants in3 yoga classes and 36 participants in 3 school sport classes). 85 datasets were included in the final analysis. Yoga significantly reduced anxiety/depression when compared to school sport after 10 weeks (p = 0.004). No significant treatment ef-fects were found for the other outcome measures. Although nonsig-nificant, yoga showed greater improvement compared to school sport for most other outcomes. The 6-month follow-up showed in- consistent results.In the qualitative interviews participants evaluated yoga classes en- thusiastically and reported a variety of physical and psychological benefits as well as overall restorative effects.ConclusionsYoga may be an effective method for coping with anxiety/depression in school sport settings for adolescents. Well-designed RCTs includ- ing active control comparisons are warranted. O16 Explain the perception and experience of infertile womenundergoing IVF/ICSI O16 QuestionFertility in many cultures has a high value. If it fails, it can become a destructive emotional experience. In this crisis situation, infertile cou-ples more than other people are affected by depression, anxiety, lowself-esteem and dissatisfied. The aim of this study is to explain the perception and experience of infertile women undergoing IVF/ICSI from acupressure.MethodsThis study was a qualitative study and performed on the 16 infertile women undergoing IVF/ICSI in Milad IVF Center, Imam Reza hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. Qualified individuals pur-posefully selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria andwere randomly divided into two groups of real and sham acupres- sure. In the real acupressure group, P6 and HT7 points on two hands were under acupressure. Points in the sham acupressure group weretwo centimeters away from the main points. Acupressure was per-formed in twelve sessions. Four sessions were done by the practi- tioner and eight sessions by own patient. Acupressure was trained to the patient by practitioner. After intervention participants were inter-viewed. Then, interviews were organized and coded. Data analysiswas done by using of conventional content analysis based on three primary phases of preparation, organization and reporting. ResultsResults of the experience and perception were in two categories.Those were body understandings and positive experiences from acupressure. ConclusionThis study showed that acupressure is effective on infertile womenhealth. Further research is justified about social flexibility and individ- ual in women in related to reproductive and sexuality issues. O17 Differences in the tongue features of primary dysmenorrhea patients and controls Jihye Kim, Keun H KimKorea Institute of Oriental Medicine, KM Fundamental Research Division,Daejeon, South Korea Correspondence: Keun H Kim 17(Suppl 1): O17 ObjectiveThe aim of this study is to investigate the relationships between tongue features and the presence or absence of menstrual pain.MethodsThis study was designed as a prospective, observational study and was conducted at the Kyung Hee University hospital. A total of 48 eli- gible participants aged 20 to 29 years were enrolled and assigned totwo groups, with primary dysmenorrhea (PD) patients in Group Aand healthy subjects in Group B, according to their visual analogue scale (VAS) scores. Group A included 24 females with PD caused byBMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 30 of 165qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome (QSBS) with VAS scores 4. Group B, the healthy subjects, included 24 females with few premen- strual symptoms and VAS scores < 4. All participants completed fourvisits (menses-follicular-luteal-menses phases) and tongue imageswere obtained using a computerized tongue image analysis system. Results The results of this study showed that the tongue coating thickness inthe menstrual phase of the PD group was significantly less than thatof the control group, and the tongue body was more reddish in the PD group than in the control group. ConclusionsAccording to traditional Korean medicine theory, patients with typ-ical QSBS normally exhibit a purplish tongue and thin coating. The results of this study will provide basic information that may be used as a reference for further studies and to establish the principles oftongue diagnosis. Additionally, the present study suggests the useful-ness of tongue features as an objective diagnostic tool. O18 Aromatherapy as a non-pharmacological intervention for dementia care -a review Carina Klocke, Stefanie JoosUniversity Hospital T\u00fcbingen, Institute Germany QuestionNon-pharmacological interventions in the area of complementaryand alternative medicine are used to increase the well-being andquality of life of dementia patients. As low-threshold interventions, they are capable to be used by patients themselves or their care- givers, and possess a low risk of side effects. We earlier conducted asystematic research in order to identify their evidence. Two promis-ing systematic reviews on aromatherapy show potentially positive ef- fects for dementia care. However, inclusion criteria were very heterogeneous and, therefore, clear recommendations for the use ofaromatherapy cannot be made. Hence, this study adopted a morehomogeneous approach with the intention to draw specific recommendations. MethodsA two-step approach was chosen: first, a research aiming at a scop-ing review on aromatherapy was conducted in PubMed from 11/ 2016 until 12/2016, including primary studies on patients with a diagnosis of dementia in English or German, interventions of aroma-therapy/-massage, and control with other interventions or placebosor none. There was no restriction on specific outcome parameters. Second, studies assessing the use of lavender oil, most commonly used in the included studies, were chosen to produce a homoge-neous verbal synthesis.Results In the first step, n = 245 studies were identified. Title and abstract screening left n = 17 relevant studies for inclusion. A first analysis ofthe full texts showed the use of the following plants: lavender (n =11), lavender/orange (n = 1), melissa (n = 2), lavender/orange in turn with rosemary/lemon (n = 1), lavender in turn with sweet orange and tea tree (n = 1), not specified (n = 1). Focusing on lavender, the studydesigns are RCTs (n = 5), CTs (n = 4), no control (n = 2). The ways ofapplication are air diffusion (n = 6), aroma massage (n = 5), dermal application (n = 3), unknown (n = 1); n = 4 studies examined more than one condition. Group sizes vary between n = 1 and n = 73. Over-all, n = 8 studies using lavender show positive effects on agitation,behavioral and psychological symptoms, anxiety and insomnia; n = 3 studies cannot conclude any consistent effects. The combination of aromatherapy with massage tends to be more effective.ConclusionAromatherapy, with lavender in particular, shows potential for in- creasing the quality of life and well-being of dementia patients, inde- pendent of the way of application, e.g. through decreasingbehavioral and psychological symptoms. Despite the number ofstudies and their samples being small and a meta-analysis hence be- ing as likely as not possible, starting points for further research and challenges will be discussed at the congress. O19 Nigella sativa University College London, London, WC1N 1AX, United Kingdom;2Faculty of Medicine, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia Correspondence: Abdulrahman Koshak 1): O19 Background Long-term medications in patients with asthma are needed to con-trol the underlying inflammation and prevent symptoms. However,Asthma control is considered to be suboptimal regardless of the availability of conventional treatments. Traditionally, Nigella sativa L. (NS), known as black cumin seed, is thought to be effective in treat- ing asthma or its key symptoms.Objective Our aim is to investigate the benefits of NS supplementation on clin- ical and inflammatory parameters of bronchial asthma in patients onstandard therapy.Material and methods A chemically characterised NS oil product (Marnys\u00ae) marketed as a food supplement was used in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II trial (RDBPCT) with asthma patients. The primaryoutcome was the Asthma Control Test (ACT). The secondary out- comes were lung function (predicted FEV1%), blood eosinophils, serum total Immunoglobulin E (IgE), and multiple inflammatorymediators.Results Between Jun 1 and Dec 30, 2015, 80 patients were enrolled, with 40 patients each randomly assigned to treatment and placebo groups.After 4 weeks, 10 patients had withdrawn from each group. NSshowed a statistically significant improvement in ACT and blood eo- sinophils count. NS showed non-significant elevation of predicted FEV1%. in INF-gamma, IL-10, and IL-12p70 were noteworthybetween both groups.Conclusions NS appeared to improve asthma symptoms, and some asthma- related biomarkers. Future studies should follow patients for a longerperiod and be a multicentre.Trial Registration: The trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov, iden- , Black seed O20 Research in integrative pediatrics at a University Children's Hospital in Munich, Germany Germany Correspondence: BackgroundThe project Integrative Pediatrics was initiated in 2015 in three chil- dren 's hospitals in Germany: Munich (Dr. von Hauners Children Uni- versity Hospital), Landshut and Essen.

Current treatments for paediatric anxiety havehad limited success. Recently, studies show acupuncture to be rela-tively safe and effective, even in children. Objectives To study the use of acupuncture for pediatric anxiety, and evaluatethe feasibility of the randomization process, adherence to the inter-vention by this population, and changes to measures of anxiety. Methods This pilot study was a randomized control trial of children with anx-iety, age 9 to 15, and living in Lethbridge, AB and the surroundingcommunities. Participants were randomized to acupuncture or wait- list control groups. Participants in the waitlist group was given acu-puncture after a wait-period of 5 weeks (matching the time the treat-ment group received acupuncture). Anxiety was measured using theMultidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) self and parent rating forms, and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale for Children and Adolescent (HAM-A). Acupuncture was provided by a licensed acu-puncturist at 1 session per week for 5 weeks. The nurse using theHAM-A was blinded to the children\"s group assignment. Results Nineteen participants were enrolled, with 10 in the treatment and 9in the waitlist group. Children in the acupuncture group had lowerMASC-parent scores following completion of the acupuncture session than children in the waitlist (no acupuncture) group (p < .05). Scores were significantly lower for all 3 measures of anxiety from the pre- topost- acupuncture assessments (p < .01).Conclusion Children who received acupuncture treatments had lower anxiety scores from pre- to post assessments, and compared to the wait-listgroup. Acupuncture was tolerated and acceptable to patients andtheir families.O22 Traditional Chinese medicine health education on improving sub- health status: a systematic reviewNing Liang, Xue Feng, Jian-ping Liu, Hui-juan CaoBeijing University of Chinese Medicine, Center for Evidence-based Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China Correspondence: Jian-ping Liu 1): O22 QuestionSub-health status is an intermediate state between health and dis-ease, and could restore to health if handled well with relative riskfactors (e.g. excessive pressure, unbalanced diet). This article was to summarize the current delivery ways of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) health education for sub-health status, and to explore the cor-relation between TCM health education and sub-health status.Methods Six electronic databases were searched from inception till 2016 Au- gust. Studies with control group including randomized or non-randomized controlled trials, cohort, case control, and cross-sectionalstudies were included.TCM education compared with no TCM educa- tion was included. Co-intervention was allowed in both groups. The sub-health status was considered as primary outcome and healthknowledge and behavior changes as secondary outcomes.Results Of the 1451 citations, 106 full papers were screened and finally 4 stud- ies were included. TCM health education was delivered in two ways:school courses and individualized clinician counseling. One studyshowed that compared to common health education alone, adding on TCM clinicians specific health education improved total sub-health sta- tus(P < 0.00001), and specifically fatigue(P < 0.0001), psychologicalsymptoms(P < 0.00001) and immunity (P = 0.0003). A statistically signifi-cant association was found of female status (e.g. menstruation) and knowledge and behavior improvement (P = 0.000) between with or without receiving school-based TCM health education.ConclusionsBased on limited number of evidence, there was positive correlaton between TCM health education and sub-health status or specific do- mains like female status or certain knowledge and behavior changes.Future more studies were needed and the incorporation with E-education should be paid much more attention to. O23 A systematic review of the effects of meditation on empathy,compassion, and pro-social behavior Christina M Luberto 1, Nina Boston, MA 02114, United States;2Harvard Medical School/Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, United States Correspondence: Christina M Luberto (cluberto@mgh.harvard.edu) 17(Suppl QuestionEmpathy (i.e., understanding of others emotions), compassion (i.e.,desire to relieve others suffering), and pro-social behaviors (i.e., be-haviors intended to help others) are necessary for societal well-being and improve individual health outcomes (e.g., psychological well- being, systemic inflammation). Traditionally, one implicit goal ofmeditation practices is to increase empathy and compassion. Thepurpose of the current study is to systematically review the empirical literature on the effect of meditation-based interventions on em- pathy, compassion, and pro-social behaviors.MethodsA MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase, and Cochrane databases from inception 2016 using the search terms: mind-body therapies, mindfulness,meditation, tai chi, yoga, MBSR, MBCT, empathy, compassion, love, al-truism, sympathy, or kindness. Randomized controlled trials in any population were included.BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 32 of 165Results Twenty-six studies met inclusion criteria (total N = 1,714 subjects). Most studies were conducted among healthy adults (n = 11) usingcompassion meditation (n = 10) or combined mindfulness/compas-sion meditation (n = 8), often 8-12 weeks in duration (n = 12) and de- livered in a group format (n = 17). Most control groups were wait-list or no-treatment (n = 15). Outcome measures included self-reportedemotions (e.g., composite scores, validated measures of empathy)and observed behavioral outcomes (e.g., real-world helping behavior, donations during computer games). Most studies showed a low risk of bias. Results of low-bias studies demonstrated significant improve-ments in observable pro-social outcomes following meditation train-ing. Results for self-reported outcomes were encouraging, though less consistent. ConclusionsMeditation is efficacious for improving pro-social outcomes. Furtherresearch using more diverse samples, longer-term follow-up, and standardized interventions and outcome measures is warranted. O24 Deficits in massage related adverse events case reporting andimplications for the therapeutic massage and bodywork Karen Boulanger4 1Indiana University School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, Health Sciences, Indianapolis, IN, United States;2Indiana University School of Physical Education, Tourism, and Management, Kinesiology, Indianapolis, IN, United States;3Indiana School of Medicine, Ruth Lilly Medical Library, Indianapolis, IN, United States;4Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States Correspondence: Niki Munk IntroductionAdverse event (AE) reporting is lacking in massage research. Many case reports exist describing medical intervention for purported mas-sage related AEs. The current study provides a rich description re-garding reporting thoroughness and implications of case reports documenting treatment for massage attributed AEs. Methods1)Systematic identification of published, peer-reviewed case reportsfor treatment of massage related AEs following PRISMA recommen- dations, 2)audit development based on CAse REport (CARE) guide- lines and AE reporting guidelines, 3)audit implementation, and4)descriptive analysis of audit scores.Results Search identified 1041 articles; 71 met study inclusion criteria. Of the 51 audit items assessed, articles included approximately 49% of thenecessary guideline items. Few audited case reports included clientperspective (7%), race(11%), and occupation/activities(21%) or pa- tient consent to publish the report(7%). On average, articles reported 1.7(SD1.2) of the 12 possible AE causing descriptors. None included adescription of massage provider training, scope-of-practice, or settingand most (70%) did not describe the massage provider at all. Few ar- ticles included a description of the massage pressure (6%), num- ber(32%), length(11%), frequency(6%), or duration(4%). Nonereported an attempt to contact the massage provider for informa-tion. Massage was the likely or absolute AE cause in 79% of cases but in 59% of those, massage was not the sole cause of the AE. Thirty percent of articles included situations of unforeseen, under-lying, and/or coincidental conditions. Various implications arediscussed. Conclusion Most articles implicated massage for AEs yet lacked enough detail toadequacy inform massage practice and education or massages rolein these medically treated situations.O25 Non-pharmacological multicomponent interventions as BackgroundAs there is no effective pharmacological treatment for dementia, it is profitable to focus on non-pharmacological interventions. Our object-ive is to present the promising approach of non-pharmacologicalmulticomponent therapies using the example of a German random- ized controlled trial (RCT) and to give a systematic review of the international literature.MethodsIn the German RCT 119 patients with primary degenerative dementia received either a highly standardized intervention consisting of motor stimulation, activities of daily living, and cognitive stimulation(MAKS) or treatment as usual. The systematic review was based on asearch in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and PSYNDEX. All articles published till August 2016 in English and German language were considered. ResultsAt 6 months the MAKS group showed an improvement in overall de-mentia symptoms compared to no change in the control group (ad- justed mean difference (AMD) = -6.8, 95% -3.3, P< .001, Cohen\"s d= 0.66). The results at 12 months (n = 61) showed, that the MAKS group remained stable in cognitive function (AMD = CI 0.7 to 6.4, P< .05, Cohen\"s d= 0.50), whereas the control group showed a significant deterioration. The literature review showed thatthe most common components are varieties of physical and cogni-tive stimulation. Conclusion Multicomponent interventions are able to stabilize and even improvedementia symptoms. The growing body of work in this field needsto be systematically assessed and evaluated. O26 Acupuncture for patients with multiple sclerosis associated fatigue -a randomized controlled trial Daniel Epidemiology and Health Economics, Charit\u00e9 -Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany;2Institute for Complementary and Integrative Medicine, University of Zurich andUniversity Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland;3NeuroCure Clinical Research Center, Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany; 4Experimental and Clinical Research Center, Max Delbrueck Center for Molecular Medicine and Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin,Germany;5First Teaching Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, China;6Department of Neurology with Experimental Neurology, Charit\u00e9 Germany 1): BackgroundFatigue influences daily activities of patients with multiple sclerosis(MS) and reduces their quality of life. Most of clinical trials evaluatinginterventions for fatigue in MS have shown only minor benefits. Objective We aimed to evaluate whether 1) acupuncture or 2) mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in addition to usual care are effectivein reducing fatigue in MS patients compared to usual care alone.BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 33 of 165Methods We performed a single-center, randomized, three-arm, controlled trial in a university study center specialized on MS. 116 outpatients withMS and fatigue for at least 3 months and an average score of 4o n the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) were randomly allocated to three groups (42 acupuncture, 21 MBSR, and 41 usual care). Patients in the acupuncture group received 24 treatments within 12 weeks inaddition to usual care, the MBSR group received 12 weeks of MBSRtreatment in addition to usual care, and the usual care group contin- ued any previous treatment. The primary outcome was the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) after 12 weeks (values 1-7, with higher values in-dicating more fatigue). Because of recruitment difficulties recruitmentfor MBSR was stopped early and only acupuncture vs. usual care was analyzed in the primary analysis (ANCOVA adjusted for baseline FSS and gender).ResultsThe primary outcome fatigue (mean adjusted FSS score after 12 weeks) was 4.7 (95% CI [4.4;5.1]) in the acupuncture group and 5.4 [5.0;5.7]) in the usual care group (difference: 0.6 [0.16; 1.07], p =0.009).Conclusion Acupuncture in addition to usual care was significantly superior to usual care alone. Therefore acupuncture might be beneficial for MSpatients with fatigue, particularly with regard to limited treatmentoptions for these symptoms, but more research is needed. Further outcomes will be presented at the conference. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01864707 O27 Osteopathic treatment in addition therapy inpatients with Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): a evaluate the effectiveness of custom tailored osteopathic treat- ment in addition to medical standard therapy in patients sufferingfrom GERD.Methods Three trained osteopaths conducted the study in their private prac- tices in Germany. 70 patients aged 27 to 75 years with a history ofGERD were included in the study. By means of externalrandomization 35 patients were allocated to the intervention group and 35 to the control group. In the intervention group 4 osteopathic treatments at intervals of two weeks were performed with a follow-up after 12 weeks. All participants were allowed to continue withtheir individual pharmacological therapy on demand (usual care). Pri- mary outcome parameter was frequency and severity of reflux symp- toms (Reflux Disease Questionnaire, RDQ). As secondary outcomeparameters quality of life in reflux and dyspepsia was assessed by adisease-specific questionnaire (QOLRAD). Results The inter-group comparison of changes revealed relevant improve-ments in support of the osteopathic treatment for the main outcomeparameter symptom frequency and severity (RDQ overall score: be- tween group difference of means 5.9; 95% CI: 3 to 8.9; p < 0.005). Fre- quency of symptoms decreased by 37% and severity by 29%. Equallyquality of life improved in favor of the osteopathic group (QOLRADoverall score: between group difference of means to 1; p < 0.005). ConclusionFour osteopathic treatments over a period of six weeks led to statisti-cally significant and clinically relevant positive changes of reflux symptoms and quality of life in reflux and dyspepsia in patients suf- fering from GERD.German Clinical Register: 1Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel;2Gastroenterology, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong;3Cyprus IBD Center, IBD, Nicossia, Cyprus Correspondence: 1): O28 Background and aimsCurcumin, a herbal-compound, may be efficacious in the treatmentof ulcerative colitis (UC). In this study we investigated the efficacy of curcumin add-on therapy for inducing remission in patients with mild-to moderate UC.MethodsIn this multi-center randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind study, 50 patients with active mild-moderate UC (defined by score of 5 to12 in the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI)) were allo-cated to receive 3gr daily of curcumin or placebo for one month ontop of optimized (oral + topical) 5ASA treatment. Clinical index (SCCAI), endoscopic index (partial Mayo) and serological parameters were determined at entry and conclusion of study period.ResultsIn the intention-to-treat analysis, 14/26 (54%) patients receiving cur- cumin 0/24 patients receiving placebo achieved clinical remis- sion (SCCAI 2) at week 4 (P = 0.01, OR 42.2, 95CI 2.3 to 760). Clinical response (reduction of 3 points in SCCAI) was achieved in 17/26 pa- tients receiving curcumin and in 3/24 patients receiving placebo (P < 0.001, OR 13.2, 95CI 3.1 to 56.6). Endoscopic remission (partial Mayo score 1) was observed in 8/22 (36%) of patients receiving curcumin and in 0/16 (0%) of the patients receiving placebo (P = 0.035, OR23.5, 95CI 1.2 to 445). The mean change in partial Mayo score was +0,15 \u00b1 0.49 for the placebo arm compared to -0.55 \u00b1 0.79 in the cur- cumin arm (P = 0.04). No serious adverse events were recorded.ConclusionCurcumin as add-on therapy was superior to placebo for inducing clinical and endoscopic remission in mild-to-moderate active UC with no apparent adverse effects. Curcumin may be a safe and promisingagent in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. O29 Effects of yoga versus the low-FODMAP diet on gastrointestinal symptoms and the microbiota in patients with irritable bowel syndrome -a randomized Medicine, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany; 2Division of Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, United States;3Case Digestive Health Research Institute and Departments of Medicine, CaseWestern University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, United States; 4ZIEL - Institute for Food & Health, Technical University of Munich, Freising, Germany;5Nutrition and Immunology, Technical University of Munich, Weihenstephan, Germany;6Australian Research Centre in Complementary and Integrative Medicine (ARCCIM), Faculty of Health,University 1): O29 Purpose To examine the effect of a yoga intervention versus a low-FODMAP diet (LFD) on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), as well as to explore po-tential changes in the gut microbiota.BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 34 of 165Methods 59 patients with IBS undertook a single-blind, randomized controlled trial involving a yoga intervention or LFD for 12 weeks. Changes ingastrointestinal symptoms (primary outcome IBS-SSS), quality of life(IBS-QOL, SF-36) and perceived stress (CPSSS, PSQ) were examined at weeks 12 and 24. 16S RNA analysis was performed after 12 weeks to investigate the microbiota.ResultsThere was no significant difference between the groups after 12 weeks in the IBS-SSS (-31.80; 95%CI = -11.90,75.50; p = 0.151), = -4.21,71.04; p = 0.081). Explorative withingroup comparison showed significant effects for yoga and LFD at12 weeks and 24 weeks (all p < 0.001). Comparable within group ef- fects occurred for the other outcomes. Significant changes in the composition of the gut bacteria could be seen between the groupsafter 12 weeks (p = 0.041, corr. p = 0.082) with a decrease in certainspecies after the FODMAP intervention. Conclusions This study found that both yoga and LFD group had a signifi-cant reduction in gastrointesti nal symptoms and an increase in the quality of life, but seemed to act though different path- ways. The FODMAP diet might unfold its effects through a change in the gut bacteria composition while Yoga might actthrough the parasympathetic nervous system. More research iswarranted on the underlying mechanism of both interventions and the potential benefit of their synergetic use, its effects and its safety. O30 Acupuncture to improve live birth rates for women undergoingIVF: findings from a randomized controlled trial Caroline Smith 1, Sheryl de Lacey2, Michael Chapman3, Julie Penrith, Australia;2Flinders University, Bedford Park, Australia;3University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia;4University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand;5IVF Med, Brisbane, Australia;6Western Sydney University, School of Science and Health, Campbelltown, Australia Correspondence: Caroline Smith (caroline.smith@westernsydney.edu.au) BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): O30 The evidence of acupuncture as an adjunct to IVF is conflicting. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of a short course of acupuncture compared with a non-invasive sham control for womenundergoing a fresh IVF cycle on clinical outcomes.Methods: a randomized controlled trial included women aged less than 43 years and undergoing a fresh IVF or ICSI cycle was con- ducted at IVF units in Australia and New Zealand. At randomizationthere was stratification by number of previous embryo transfers, ageof the women and IVF clinic site. Treatment was administered be- tween days 6 to 8 of the stimulated cycle and two treatments were administered on the day of embryo transfer. Participants, outcomesassessors and the analyst were blind to group allocation, and acu-puncturists were not blinded. The primary study outcome was live birth. Secondary outcomes included clinical pregnancy, miscarriage prior to 12 weeks, quality of life, and infertility self-efficacy.Results: 848 women were randomly allocated to acupuncture (n =424) or sham acupuncture (n = 424). Fifty one women were excluded due to post randomisation exclusions or women withdrew their con- sent, 193 women had a cancelled cycle e.g. no oocytes collected, nosurviving embryo, clinical decision to freeze all embryos. 604 womenproceeded to embryo transfer (acupuncture n = 301, sham acupunc- ture n = 303). The live birth rate was 24.3% of those having an em- bryo transfer in the acupuncture group and 23.4% of those in thesham acupuncture control group (relative risk, 1.04, 95% confidenceinterval 1.04 to 1.38). Conclusion: There was no evidence of a difference in the live birth rate for women undergoing embryo transfer for women receivingacupuncture or non-invasive sham acupuncture.O31 Effects of a mindfulness training on perceived stress, self- compassion and empathy of primary care physicians: aquantitative and qualitative analysisBram 1): O31 BackgroundPrimary care physicians are subjected to high administrative de-mands and a high workload leading to a large incidence of burnout. Mindfulness training has been found to improve stress resilience in medical students and physicians. This study reports on the effects ofan 8 week mindfulness training on self-compassion, empathy andperceived stress in primary care physicians. Methods A mixed quantitative and qualitative methodology was chosen. Theenrolled primary care physicians completed questionnaires on per-ceived stress (PSS), self-compassion (Neff), self-reflection (Groningen reflective ability scale) at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. A phe- nomenological qualitative content analysis was conducted on 6semi-structured interviews 3 months after the training to evaluate: inwhich manner the mindfulness training changed the way of looking at yourself, looking at your environment and looking at your patient. ResultsFirst analysis of data from 44 participating primary care physicians in-dicated a significant reduction in perceived stress (p < 0,000), im- provement in self-compassion (p < 0,000) and an improvement in self-reflection (p = 0,018) after the mindfulness training compared tobefore the training. Qualitative analysis revealed the themes aware-ness, acceptance, peace, openness, and integration in daily life sev- eral, related to changes in self-reflection and changes in perceiving your environment. Additionally, \"connection with the patient\" was re-vealed as a strong theme, indicating a better understanding of thepatient and an improved ability to regard the patient as a whole. Conclusions Mindfulness training is an effective approach for fostering compas-sion and self-reflection in primary care physicians, in addition to im-provement of stress-resilience. O32 Cancer therapy with mistletoe extracts. Short overview of 100 year experiences and recent resultsWilfried 1): O32 IntroductionCancer therapy with mistletoe extracts has been proposed by Rudolf Steiner 100 years ago in 1917. The first preparation \"Iscador \"should \"replace the knife of the surgeon \"and be used in all types of cancer. The first cases already showed less morbidity of the patients and a better quality of life, as well as a surprisingly long survival time. In the following, a short overview and recent results of randomized studies are shown.MethodsTo find out the mode of action, in vitro research has been done since the early sixties. The first clinical trials were retrospective studies comparing with a historical population, case series prospective ornon-randomized clinical trials. In parallel many ex vivo/in vitro - stud-ies have been done, because of the multiple immunomodulating ac- tivities of mistletoe. End of the seventies the first prospective randomized clinical trials were published.ResultsSome constituents of mistletoe extract are cytotoxic. Mistletoe lectins induce and viscotoxins necrosis in cancer cells. Sur- prisingly healthy human lymphocytes are not affected in the sameway. In contrary, many of their subtypes are stimulated by mistletoeBMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 35 rhamnogalactouro- nanes in Mistletoe may protect healthy PBMC from the DNA-damaging effects of chemotherapy. Recent re-sults even showed a synergistic effect of mistletoe and chemother-apy on cancer cells in vitro, testing different tumor cells and their respective standard chemotherapy regimen. There are about 90 clinical trials with Iscador published since 1962.The examined tumour entities were in breast, colon, lung, skin, cer-vix, pancreas, stomach, bladder and others. Several reviews showed strong effects regarding morbidity and quality of life, and moderate effects on tumour response and survival. None of the studies showednegative effects or reported from serious adverse events.Recent GCP-studies showed a benefit in quality of life as well as a pro- longation of the survival time. A randomized early breast cancer study using Iscador in parallel to CAF showed the improvement of quality oflife and neutropenia. A study with patients with locally advanced ormetastatic carcinoma ot the pancreas showed a median survival of the Iscador-patients of 4,8 months and 2,7 months for the control patients, who received no therapy anymore (HR = 0,49; p < 0,0001).ConclusionMistletoe extracts decrease the morbidity of the patients and in- crease the quality of life as well as the survival time of cancer pa- tients. The therapy is safe. O33 Research in complementary and alternative medicine in Finland: aliterature University, \u00c5bo, Finland 2017, 17(Suppl 1): O33 The situation and prerequisites of research in complementary and alter- native medicine (CAM) vary between countries across the world. Some countries have well established CAM research centers and in most countries the numbers of CAM publications have grown steadily duringthe last couple of decades. Finland does not have a CAM research cen-ter and its prerequisites for CAM research have been very scarce. The regulation of CAM is far from being solved. Public discussion on CAM often ends up in controversies characterized by strong juxtapositions.The presentation focuses on Finnish CAM research in the long-termperspective by analysing CAM research articles and PhD theses from the 1960s until 2015. The analysis shows the slow growth of the number of publications and the heterogeneity of settings for CAM re-search. However, certain trends in Finnish CAM research could beidentified. The most important focus of research has been on CAM use and the experiences of CAM users. Also the attitudes of health care personnel in Finland have been studied, as well as the history ofdifferent traditional healing practices. Surprisingly little research con-ducted on the efficacy of CAM treatments was found which might be due to the lack and scarcity of research resources. We argue that due to the absence of national CAM policy including research policyand the dominance of research on CAM usage, the category of CAMand its central concepts have not been analysed thoroughly. This might have an impact on the strong controversies in public discus- sions about CAM treatments in the Finnish context. O34 The potential of video analysis for recognising ergotropic andtrophotropic phases of patients during music and occupational therapy Claudia Wenzel, Iris Zoderer, Patricia Pammer, Patrick Simon, GerhardTucekDepartment of Health Sciences, IMC University of Applied Sciences/ Austria, Krems an der Donau, 3500, Austria Correspondence: 1): O34Purpose As part of a mixed-methods study focusing on the optimum chrono- biological phase for therapeutic processes, the main objective of thisqualitative part of the study was to identify ergotropic and tropho-tropic phases of patients participating at music or occupational ther- apies with the help of systematic video analysis. MethodsData collection included videographies (n = 10) of music and occupa-tional therapies as well as qualitative expert interviews (n = 10). Grounded Theory was used both as a methodology and as a method of analysis (coding). The computer software Atlas.ti (Vers. 7.0) wasused for both interview and video analysis.Results The systematic interview and video analysis showed that researchers and professionals can differentiate between ergotropic and tropho-tropic phases in the course of music or occupational therapies, butthere are no unique categories referring only to ergotropic or to tro- photropic phases. Posture & motor function, followed by verbal, ac- tion & activity, concentration facial expression and interaction werethe most frequently categories.Conclusions As there are no unique categories for either ergotropic or tro- photropic phases, the context of the therapy must be takeninto account as well as parameters like the subjective motiv-ation of the patient. The empirical results can be considered as the foundation for the development of an observance tool for identifying ergotropic or throphotropic phases of patients withthe objective to find the right chronobiological phase for clin-ical therapies. O35 The use of complementary and alternative methods (CAM) among Swedish cancer patientsKathrin Wode 1, Stockholm, 17(Suppl O35 Although Swedish conventional health care providers rarely discuss,recommend or prescribe CAM, research indicates use comparable to other high-income countries. The aim of this study was to describe patterns of CAM use among Swedish cancer patients.In this cross-sectional study, questionnaires were distributed con-secutively to 1297 cancer patients at Stockholm 's university hospital 's out-patient units. Response rate was 58% (n = 755). Answers were an-alyzed using descriptive statistics and content analysis.Use of CAM over lifetime was reported by 34%; after cancerdiagnosis by 26% and new CAM use since cancer diagnosis by 17%. Females, age 30-49 and high education predicted CAM use. Top 3 methods were vitamin s and minerals, natural prod- ucts and relaxation. Main reasons for use were improvement ofphysical, emotional and general wellbeing. Side-effects were few and mild; average monthly costs <50 \u20ac; satisfaction was high. One third discussed their CAM u se with cancer care providers; 2% thought that the Oncology team didn 'tn e e dt od i s c u s s CAM. Over 50% thought that CAM therapies should be offeredin cancer care. Swedish cancer patients use CAM despite limited access and in-formation, are highly satisfied and experience specific benefits. Ingeneral, CAM use seems to be a conscious choice compatible with daily life and reflects patients' needs to contribute to their wellbeing. The lacking involvement of conventional providers in patients CAM use diverge with patients needs and might be arisk for patient safety. If cancer care has the ambition to be per- son centered, patients preferences about CAM need to be addressed.BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 36 treatment for randomizedclinical trialsYang Li-qiong Wang, Jin-gen Li, Ning Liang, Ying Wang, Jian- ping Liu Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Centre for Evidence-BasedChinese Medicine, Beijing, ChinaCorrespondence: Yang Xiao-ying 1): O36 ObjectiveThe review aimed to assess the and safety of Dengzhan Shengmai (DZSM) capsule for ischemic stroke. databases for randomized controlled trialsof DZSM capsule for people with ischemic stroke. Co-intervention was allowed if applied in all arms. Risk ratio and mean difference with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were used as effect measures byusing RevMan 5.3.Results We identified 14 RCTs involving 5206 participants, and all trials were conducted in China. Majority of the included trials were of high riskof bias in methodological quality. For acute ischemic stroke, addingDZSM capsule to conventional therapy achieved higher Barthel Index scores (MD 22.37, 95% CI 21.34 to 23.40), lower neurological function deficit scores (MD - 3.73, 95% CI -5.27 to -2.19) and lower recurrencerate (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.10, 0.46). For patients in their convalescence(or sequelae stage) of ischemic stroke, DZSM cap- sule was superior in improving quality of life (MD 28.8, 95% CI 7.10 to 50.50) and recurrence (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.99) compared toplacebo. No trials reported the serious adverse events.Conclusion DZSM capsule appears to improve neurological function, quality of life and reduce recurrence rate based on conventional therapy for is-chemic stroke and seems generally safe. However, the findings ofbenefit are inconclusive due to generally weak evidence, and further large, rigorous trials are still warranted. Clinical care O37 Medical cannabis access in Canada: new opportunities and challenges Lynda Balneaves1, Capler2 R3T 2 N2, Canada;2Interdisciplinary Studies Graduate Program, Columbia, Vancouver, CanadaCorrespondence: Lynda Balneaves IntroductionSince 2001, Canadians have had access to medical cannabis. In 2013,new regulations and a production system were instated to maintainreasonable access to medical cannabis while addressing safety issues. Recent court rulings, as well as a movement towards legalization, have further shifted how medical cannabis is conceptualized and of-fered in Canada. The purpose of this review is to examine the oppor-tunities and challenges facing medical cannabis access in Canada. Methods This review will reflect on the current literature and regulation historyin Canada regarding how medical cannabis has been offered andproduced, as well as research that has explored the access experi- ences of patients utilizing medical cannabis. Preliminary findings from a survey of 369 medical cannabis users will be considered inthe context of new legislation.Findings Qualitative research has revealed Canadians have struggled to access medical cannabis, with gatekeeping, social stigma, and poor qualitybeing reported as challenges. Survey research shows access remains problematic for 50% of patients, with cost, product availability, and wait-times posing significant challenges. To address these issues,new legislation has expanded the types of product available as wellas legalized some forms of self-production. A recent task force on legalization has also been offered as a way to increase access to cannabis.ConclusionWhile legalization of cannabis may improve access, it poses new challenges with regards to how medical cannabis use is conceptual- ized, researched and made available to Canadians. Thoughtful dia-logue about these challenges is needed prior to future legislationchanges and program development. O38 Possibility of cure and prevention of radiation therapy O38 Radiotherapy treats many types of cancer effectively. But like othertreatments, it often causes side effects. These are classified as acute (occurring within few weeks after therapy), intermediate or late (oc-curring months or years after the therapy) and can have a devastat-ing effect on the quality of life of cancer patients and survivors. Due to the inadequacy of most of the radio-protectors in controlling the side effects of conventional cancer therapy the complementary andalternative medicines have attracted the view of researchers andmedical practitioners more recently. The use of compounds which can selectively protect normal tissues against radiation injury is of immense interest because beside pro-tecting the normal tissue, could also permits use of higher doses ofradiation to obtain better cancer control and possible cure. Curcu- min, for example, has been reported to protect various study systems against the deleterious effects induced by ionizing radiation and alsoto enhance the effect of radiation.Oncology acupuncture has become a new and promising field of re- search. Recent trials made efforts in studying hot flashes in breast cancer patients under hormonal therapy, xerostomia induced byradiotherapy in head and neck cancer, and fatigue and insomnia.Dietary modification such as caloric restriction has been shown to decrease tumor initiation and progression and could be used during radiotherapy course as a novel therapeutic intervention to enhancecytotoxic therapies and reduce the cytotoxic effects on normaltissue. Preliminary data support the efficacy of Homoeopathic topical Calen- dula for prophylaxis and treatment of acute dermatitis duringradiotherapy. O39 Type D personality, anxiety and depression -does the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus make a difference in coronary and hypertensive IntroductionCardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates are linked to certainpersonality traits associated with depression and anxiety. Type D be-havior is characterized by the shared inclination to experience nega- tive emotions and to inhibit them while avoiding social contact. InBMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 37 of 165this study, we assessed the impact of the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on quantified anxiety and depression scores and type D personality in hypertensive and coronary patients.Material and methodsThe study was carried out on 107 patients with coronary artery dis- ease (CAD; mean age 64.8 years) and 203 patients with hypertension (HT; mean age 63.7 years). The hospital-based 14 item anxiety anddepression scale (HAD) and the Duke Anxiety-Depression Scale(DUKE) were used for standardized self-reported measurements for anxiety and depression scores. Type D personality was assessed using the DS-14 scale, containing 7 item negative affectivity (NA) andsocial inhibition (SI) subscales. Correlations were the non-parametric Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results T2DM was present in 62 patients with CAD and 97 patients with HT.Type D personality (NA added to SI scores 14) was found in 29% patients with CAD and 27,7% with HT. Anxiety scores (HAD A) were significantly higher in CAD patients with T2DM than in non-diabetics (p = 0.014) and correlated with LDL levels (r = 0.133, p = 0.025). DS-14NA scores were significantly higher in HT patients with T2DM than innon-diabetics (p = 0.023). Type D personality was present to a signifi- cant extent in HT patients with T2DM compared to non-diabetics (p = 0.015).DUKE scale scores correlated significantly with HDL levels (r = 0.297,p < 0.001) and arterial diastolic pressure (ADP) levels for CAD (r = 0.225, p = 0.004) and HT (r = 0.180, p = 0.003) patients. Higher DUKE scores were obtained in CAD compared to HT patients, regardless ofT2DM diagnosis (Mann-Whitney test, p = 0.011). Patients with stage 3HT had higher DUKE scores than those with stage 2, thus correlating with disease progression. ConclusionThis study showed that type D personality and anxiety are closelylinked to diabetes in coronary and hypertensive patients. Based on these findings, we consider that personalized psychotherapeutic in- terventions are extremely important for disease progression andshould be part of complex cardiovascular prevention programs. O40 An integrative approach with acupuncture for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): a case report Lan Kao, Yumin ChoDepartment of General Internal Medicine, Center for East-West Medicine,University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, CA 90024, USA Correspondence: Yumin Cho 1): O40 Background: This study is an assessment of the acupuncture utility for treatment of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is char- acterized by \"intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks of past trau- matic events, avoidance of reminders of trauma, hypervigilance,sleep disturbance, all of which lead to considerable social, interper- sonal1\"and physiological dysfunctions. This case involves a 43-year old female veteran diagnosed with PTSD and mild traumatic brain in- jury, due to military combat and sexual trauma, after her 2012 de-ployment to Afghanistan. She presented with depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, headaches, chest pain, lower back pain, bladder pain, and constipation.Methods: Patient completed a questionnaire pre and post acu-puncture to assess the severity of symptoms. Acupuncture sessions were 30 minutes, administered once a week for 3 weeks in a groupsetting, using sishencong, GB20, DU9/11/13/14/15/16, Ub23. Otherinterventions included qigong, cognitive processing therapy, emotionregulation, distress tolerance, biofeedback, mindfulness, art therapy, and equine therapy. Results: Anxiety level reduced from 9/10 to 4/10. Depression re-duced from 10/10 to 0/10. Sleep duration and quality improved from 2-4 hours a night to 6-7 hours of sustained sleep without medi- cation, and sleep apnea subsided. Headaches diminished and medi- cation stopped. Back pain improved from 5-7/10 severity to 2/10 andmedication stopped by the third treatment. Bladder pain eased and medication usage ceased. Bowel movement became regular. Conclusions: This case demonstrates the potential utility of acupunc- ture within an integrative setting as an adjunct intervention for thetreatment of PTSD. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient to publish this data. 1. Sareen, J, Stein, M B, Hermann, R. UpToDate.

Fatigue belongs to one of its most distressing symptoms. The majorityof cancer patients complement conventional cancer treatment withComplementary and Alternative Medicine (CAMs), however, more evi- dence to encourage such supportive treatments is urgently needed. The primary objective of the CONGO (Complementary Nursing in Gy-necologic Oncology)-study was to investigate if a complex CAMintervention, consisting of a CAM nursing package, resource-oriented counseling, and CAM information materials, improves health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and associated patient-oriented outcomes inbreast and gynecologic cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Aspart of the HRQOL analyses, we aimed to analyze if and how pa- tients' fatigue levels benefited from the CAM interventions. MethodsFrom July 2014 until April 2016, randomized controlled trial data of251 patients treated for localized or metastatic cancers were col- lected in the National Center of Tumor Diseases (NCT) Heidelberg and the Community Hospital Karlsruhe (SKK). The intervention grouppatients received routine care plus the CAM intervention packageduring chemotherapy treatment (CHT); control group patients re- ceived routine supportive care only. The primary endpoint HRQOL was assessed with the EORTC-QLQ-C30; the secondary endpoint fatigue was assessed with the 13-itemscale of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F). Both endpoints were measured and follow-up T4 -6 months after CHT. In addition the HRQOL was assessed weekly in the patient diary. Results Databank cleansing of all time points was finalized in December 2016. Currently, the data of the primary and secondary outcomes arebeing examined. Data are analyzed with linear mixed models includ-ing intervention/control group, the interaction of treatment and time, fatigue/HRQOL baseline scores, and the strata center and stage of cancer as fixed effects. The models will also consider a random inter-cept to take account of the correlation between observations of thesame patients assuming an unstructured correlation structure. Complete results of these analyses can be presented in May 2017 at the ECIM&ICCMR.BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 38 of 165Conclusions The CONGO-study evaluates if cancer patients' supportive therapy can be improved by a CAM intervention delivered by trained oncol-ogy nurses. Due to patients' increasing uptake of holistic practicesand products, it is essential that healthcare professionals know how to respond to patients' needs, and that evidence-based CAM pro- grams are further integrated into oncology healthcare services. O42 Acupuncture in oxytocin infusion; however, the use ofthese agents produces fetal and maternal side effects. TraditionalChinese medicine advocates the use of acupuncture to soften the cervix and induce uterine contractions. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of acupuncture to induce labor onset. Acu-puncture was applied in post-date pregnancies and the primary out-come was the rate of women submitted to labor induction for prolonged pregnancy at week 41 5. MethodsAfter informed consent, 375 undelivered women after 40 2 gesta-tional age were considered eligible for the study and 112 women treated with acupuncture and 263 in the observation group. The acu- puncture sessions were planned up to a maximum of 4 sessions upto 41st week plus 4 days. At 41 5 week a pharmacological inductionof labor was planned. Results Acupuncture and observation groups showed a similar rate of nullipar-ous women (66.1% vs 55.9%) pre-labor rupture (287.7 \u00b1 331.6 321.5 ml),) weight(3532.7 \u00b1 399gr).The rate of operative delivery islower in women treated with acupuncture in respect to control (6.3% versus 11.4%). The total rate of labor induction significantly differed be- tween acupuncture and control groups (19.6% versus 38.0%). In par-ticular the labour induction indicated for pregnancy\" waslower in women submitted to acupuncture(6/112 versus 23/263). Conclusion The present study demonstrated that acupuncture applied a term ofdelivery seems effective in reducing the rate of labor induction per-formed for prolonged pregnancy at 41 5 weeks. O43 Complementary and integrative medicine in nursing homes -results of a prospective, exploratory, comparative, two-armed cohort study from the residents' perspective Miriam Ortiz, Katharina Berlin, 12209, Germany Therapy\" (KT) is a form of Complementary and IntegrativeMedicine (CIM) that includes a combination of hydrotherapy, herbalmedicine, mind-body medicine, physical activities and healthy nutri- tion. Since 2007 nursing homes (NH) in Germany started to integrate KT in daily care. The aim was to investigate the long-term impact ofKT on NH residents.Methods We conducted a prospective, exploratory, two-armed cohort study to compare NH with (KT group) and without KT (but with routine healthpreventive interventions (HPI); control group) over 12 months. EachNH with KT was matched to a control NH. Outcomes included fre- quency of received KT resp. HPI, a quality of life (QUALIDEM) and a multidimensional global impression scale (NOSGER).ResultsWe included n = 105 residents from 7 NH (KT group) and n = 69 resi- dents from 6 NH (control group). 82% of the residents were female (BMI 28.3 \u00b1 5.9; age: 83.4 \u00b1 7.7 years). There were no major differ-ences between the groups in the QUALIDEM items. KT group resi-dents had significantly better values for the NOSGER dimension \"challenging behaviour\" (p = 0.003) after 6 months and \"memory cap- acities\" after 12 months (p = 0.040). In a post hoc sensitivity analysisresidents of both groups who had received more than 30 times KTresp. HPI per month showed significantly better values in social and well-being items of the QUALIDEM and NOSGER. ConclusionsThe study showed only few significant differences between both NHgroups in favour for KT. The frequency of KT or HPI applications seems to influence social Trial Registration: DRKS-ID: DRKS00005049 1): O44 PurposeTo describe the process of integration of complementary medicine(CM) in the network of Cancer Departments of Tuscan public health- care which is ongoing since 2009. MethodsIn 2009 the Tuscan Tumor Institute and the Tuscan Network of Inte-grative Medicine (TNIM) established a working group composed of experts in CM and oncologists to review the literature on the use of CM in cancer care. Later in 2013 the TNIM participated in the Euro-pean Partnership for Action Against Cancer-EPAAC (7th FrameworkProgramme), with the purpose of collecting evidence on the use of CM in cancer and mapping the European centers offering integrative oncology.ResultsIn 2015 a Resolution of the Tuscan Regional Government ratified to develop the use of some CM as treatment of cancer-related symptoms, and side effects of conventional cancer therapy (acu-puncture for nausea and post-chemotherapy and post-surgeryvomiting, pain, hot flushes of iatrogenic menopause, xerostomia; homeopathy for hot flushes of iatrogenic menopause and the side-effects of radiotherapy; herbal medicine for anxiety, depres-sion, cancer-related fatigue, mucositis, nausea, vomiting and pain).A Commission of CM experts and oncologists will define how to apply this resolution. The role of CM in cancer care has been re- cently strengthened within the reform of Public Health Serviceongoing in Tuscany.Conclusions The integration of evidence-based complementary treatments as a part of a Comprehensive Cancer Care Network allows to respondsafely and effectively to the demand coming from cancer patientsand combine safety and equity of access in public health systems.BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 39 of 165O45 Increasing the survival of pancreatic cancers by Chinese Herbal MedicineWendy Wong, Bingzhong Chen, Justin WuChinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Institute of Integrative Medicine, School of Chinese Medicine, Hong Kong, Hong Kong Correspondence: Wendy Wong (wendy.wong@cuhk.edu.hk) BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): O45 With advance diagnosis of health care system, pancreatic cancer hasthe lowest overall 5-years overall survival among all other cancers.Systematic review or meta-analysis have concluded that the radio-therapy or chemotherapy are least effective. Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM) is being commonly used among patients for cancer treat- ments. The concurrent use of CHM for cancer treatment remain con-troversial since herbs were found to be interfering with the efficacyof chemotherapy or leading to potential associated toxicities. In this study, we proposed a retrospective case series study to inves- tigate the survival gain for pancreatic cancer patients who had differ-ent treatment regimens across their patients journeys. With HongKong the best location for bridging both Chinese and Conventional Medicine, the outcomes will be able to advance global interdisplinary medical industry for recommendation. This study aims at identifyingthe benefits and safety of CHM for cancer patients in terms of sur-vival, safety, adverse effect, drug-related symptoms. With the global trend of Integrative Medicine, this study could facilitate inter- professional communication for improving the clinical managementof pancreatic cancer patients in Chinese.Methods A retrospective case series was conducted on 182 patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer from 2005 to 2015 who consulted for ChineseMedicine Practitioner for CHM treatment at Central of Hong Kong. Pri-mary outcome was the overall survival after the diagnosis of cancer. Results With mean age of 56 (range of 30-87), 6 patients had only taken onlyCHM and refusing surgery, chemo- or radiotherapies. All other 176patients had taken in parallel of CHM and conventional treatment of any combination of sugery, radio- or chemotherapy. The range of survival was 4 months to 9 years with mean of 29.6 months. The me-dian of survival was 15.2 months. More than 76% patients can sus-tain the 1-year survival. Conclusion These illustrated a superior clinical outcomes than solely intake ofconventional medications. The specific herbs in playing of the role ofprolonging survival of pancreatic cancer should be investigated for wider application. This will help in identifying benefits and safety of CHM in pancreatic cancer patients. The results will help guide strat-egies to improve patient-centered actions relating to pancreatic can-cer treatment and survivorship. Education O46Graduate Masters of Science Degree Program in Complementaryand Integrative Medicine: opportunity to inform, cultivate and develop future healthcare leaders Hakima Amri, Aviad Haramati, Lucy KotlyanskayaBiochemistry and Cellular and Molecular Biology, Georgetown UniversityMedical Center, Washington, DC 20007, United States Correspondence: O46 Offering Integrative Medicine (IM) content, as a course of study priorto entering medical school or other health professions, can enhance a students awareness about values relevant to their future careerand practice. In this presentation, we intend to describe the curricu-lum for a unique Masters Degree Program, now in its 14th year, in the integrative biomedical sciences at Georgetown University. The program is designed to be completed in 11 months. The curricu-lum includes three tracks: Science-based courses: such as Biochemis- Pharmacology , CIM-based courses such as Survey Disciplines addressing Traditional Medical Systems (TCM, Ayur- veda, Unani, Naturopathy, etc.), Physiology of Mind-Body Pathophysiological States ,Nutrition, Botanicals and Supple- ments , and courses aimed at Skills to Assess Evidence, such as Evi- dence-based Medicine ,Critical Reading ,Biostatistics , as well as series of elective courses. In addition, students are required to participate inan 8-week practicum during the summer, in which they areimmersed in some aspect of integrative medicine (from bench lab toclinic or government office). We plan to share experiences from our educational model where our graduates contributed to and led a number of initiatives, that im-pacted their schools and careers. Thus, emphasizing the importanceof teaching CIM and how it promotes inter-professional education, creativity, and leadership skills. Over the years, we have also found that our graduates go on to demonstrate other desirable skills suchas: 1) creative communication skills about IM; 2) community-building,3) assuming leadership roles, 4) developing networking skills, and 5) fostering inter-professional collaborations. O47 Attitudes and beliefs about evidence-based and integrative medicine within the Chinese medicine professionBelinda Anderson 1, Roni Evans2, Ben Kligler3, Paul Marantz1 1Pacific College of Oriental Medicine; Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY 10038, United States;2University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States;3Beth Israel/Mount New York, NY, United StatesCorrespondence: 1): O47 PurposeAttitudes and beliefs have profound impacts upon behavior and learn- ing. However, with regard to evidence-based medicine (EBM) educa- tion, little attention has been given to exploring the attitudes andbeliefs of complementary healthcare students, faculty and clinicians.Methods At the Pacific College of Medicine (New York campus) surveys (con- taining close-ended and open-ended questions) of Chinese medicinestudents and faculty, and an ethnographic qualitative study of acu-puncturists (via an online forum) were undertaken to explore per- spectives on research, evidence-based and integrative medicine. ResultsThe survey response rates for students and faculty were 42 and 89%,respectively. Faculty and students indicated high degrees of interest in, and support for, the value of research and EBM. However, this de- clined as students progressed through their degree programs. Re-sponses to the open-ended survey questions, and the qualitativestudy, indicate that there is concern about paradigm differences, relevance of the scientific method, power dynamics in the healthcare system, and a preference for pluralism over integration. The rele-vance and impact of these outcomes upon learning and clinical prac-tice is discussed. Conclusions Motivating clinicians to seek out and use the latest evidence to in-form patient treatment requires an understanding of the barriers.Some of these have been shown to be practical, like lack of time or access to relevant databases and full text articles, but there is also evidence that significant cultural issues should be considered. O48 T90/R90 Building Research across Inter-Disciplinary Gaps (BRIDG)Clinical Research Training Program in Complementary and Integrative Health Ryan Bradley 1, Cathryn Booth-LaForce2, Heather Zwickey1 1National University of Natural Medicine, Helfgott Research Institute, Portland, OR, United States;2University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United StatesCorrespondence: Ryan Bradley (rbradley@nunm.edu) BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl Page 40 of 165Question Questions remain regarding the optimal approach for clinical re- search training, i.e., training conventionally trained researchers in CIHclinical research ortraining CIH clinicians in clinical research methodologies. Methods Supported by a five-year grant from the National Center for Comple-mentary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), the University of Washing-ton (UW) in Seattle, WA and the National University of Natural Medicine (NUNM) in Portland, OR developed the T90/R90 Building Research across Inter-Disciplinary Gaps (BRIDG) Clinical ResearchTraining Program in Complementary and Integrative Health. The T90trains doctoral-level CIH providers in clinical research activities at the research-intensive University of Washington. The R90 trains conven- tionally trained researchers in the clinical practices of CIH at theclinic-intensive NUNM. The Translational Research Spectrum providesa conceptual framework for both programs. Program elements in- clude: didactic training in clinical research (T90 & R90) and in CIH dis- ciplines (R90), placement with active clinical research mentors (T90 &R90), placement with active clinical mentors in CIH disciplines (R90),plus shared (T90) and independent (R90) research project develop- ment. T90 trainees and R90 participants also co-train on a collabora- tive team science project, i.e., a \"Implementation of Clinical Research\"practicum, hosted at both training sites. Program evaluation includessemi-annual completion of the Clinical Research Assessment Inven- tory (CRAI) which queries confidence in research skills and methods on a 0-10 scale; periodic evaluation of programmatic elements usingthe Supplemental Kellogg Logic -WHO (SKL/WHO) model, which em- phasizes relevance, adequacy, efficiency, effectiveness, process, im- pact, equity and sustainability; and mentor evaluations. Trainee progress is also evaluated using Individualized Development Plans(IDPs).Results T90 clinical backgrounds include Doctors of Acupuncture and Orien- tal Medicine (DAOM; n = 3) and Naturopathic Medicine (ND; n = 1).R90 research backgrounds include Doctors of Philosophy in Toxicol-ogy (n = 1) and Nutrition and Food Science (n = 1). Mean results of baseline CRAI assessments suggest moderate confidence in choosing a research topic (7.3), refining a study question (7.5), providing a sci-entific rationale (7.7) and expressing the idea in writing (7.7). Meanresults suggest less confidence in choosing appropriate research methods (5.6), choosing an appropriate population (5), designing a statistical analysis plan (5), choosing an appropriate funding sourcefor their research (4.5) and analyzing data (4).Conclusions By combining clinical research methodologies with immersive men- torship in the context of complementary and integrative health, theUW-NUNM BRIDG program exemplifies a new standard for trainingclinical researchers in CIH. O49 The National Center for Integrative Primary Healthcare - Enhancing Interprofessional Integrative Health EducationBenjamin Kligler Patricia Lebensohn2, Elisabeth Goldblatt4 1Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Family and Community Medicine, Brooklyn, New York, NY, United States;2University of Arizona, Center for Integrative Medicine, Tucson, AR, United States;3University of Minnesota, Center for Spirituality & Healing, Minneapolis, MN, United States;4Academic Collaborative for Integrative Health, Mercer Island, WA, United States Correspondence: Benjamin Kligler BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): O49 Evidence is accruing for the clinical and cost-effectiveness of integra-tive healthcare (IH); however, there is a knowledge gap for primarycare professionals, which has hindered widespread adoption of IH into healthcare systems. The University of Arizona Center for Integra- tive Medicine received a HRSA grant to establish the National Centerfor Integrative Primary Healthcare (NCIPH) to address this need.Based on a coordinated set of IH competencies across primary care professions and needs assessment, a 45-hour online interprofess- sional IH course, Foundations in Integrative Health (FIH), was devel-oped and pilot-tested in primary care training programs, e.g., familymedicine, internal medicine residencies, nursing, pharmacy, behav- ioral health, oriental medicine, chiropractic. Units Introduc- tion to IH; Prevention and through an Integrative Lens; Integra-tive Interventions; and Community Settings and Systems. A unit evaluation survey assesses met objectives, educational depth, clinical utility, helpfulness of resources and reflections, and ease of technol-ogy. A final evaluation assesses interest in applying IH principles inclinical practice, desire to seek additional IH education, course en- hanced educational experience, recommend course, incorporation of self-care practices, and site leader support for completing and relat-ing course to training. Items are rated on a 5-point scale. Measuresof resiliency and gratitude were completed at the start of the Well- being unit and following a two-week daily self-care practice. 677 trainees completed the course. Units were highly rated: met ob-jectives (4.4), technology (4.2), clinical utility (4.1), resources helpful(3.8), reflections helpful (3.8), educational depth (3.7) and sharing re- flections helpful (3.2). A majority (60-73%) recommended incorporat- ing the units into required training. Final survey ratings were alsopositive: interest in applying in practice (4.5), seek additional IH edu-cation (4.3), course enhanced educational experience (4.3), recom- mend to others (4.2), and leader support for course completion (3.8) and integrating material (3.7). Two-thirds reported incorporating newself-care practices based on what they learned in the course. Pre-post improvements (p < 0.001) were observed for the resiliency and gratitude measures. The goal of NCIPH is to transform primary care health professionaleducation to include an emphasis on providing an integrative ap-proach to patient care utilizing an interprofessional collaborative team. The FIH course can serve as a foundation in this effort. An on- line course addresses the challenges of time, cost, and curriculumconsistency and can be widely disseminated to the entire spectrumof primary care training programs. O50 Integrative nursing: reflexology effects of a a modality of Integrative Medicine, recognizes the im-portance of the person from a comprehensive and non-invasive care,enhancing the search for a physical, emotional and spiritual balance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a teaching pro- gram that introduces reflexology as an integrative modality in univer-sity nursing education.Methods A descriptive observational study was carried out, in which 85 stu- dents participated. The students responded by initiating and com-pleting the teaching program, the health questionnaire (SF12v2) andthe emotional intelligence questionnaire (TMMS24). The perceived ef- fects during and between sessions were collected on a records grid and their vivid experience were also collected by personal stories.Analysis. Data were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively with theSSPS v.10 program. Results The results showed an improvement in the quality of life and emo-tional well-being, mainly in regulation and emotional understanding.Relaxation and well-being were the most perceived effects. No ad- verse effects were observed. The analysis of the stories revealed a new concept in the understanding of integrative care, as well as thediscovery of a new way of understanding the body. TheBMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 41 of 165methodology used was shown to be effective in health education. The students identified the potential of the reflexology within the new paradigm of integrative medicine.ConclusionsReflexology promotes physical and emotional well-being, facilitating an integrative understanding of the body and health. Students affirm the need to include this knowledge in the training nursing programof an integrative and holistic care. O51 Addressing the international acupuncture standards gap for physiotherapists and chiropractors: a comparative review PurposePhysiotherapists and chiropractors across North America, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand perform a range of therapeutic needling practices to treat musculoskeletal disorders, including trad-itional East Asian acupuncture, traditional acupuncture techniquesperformed in line with biomedical diagnostic principles, and'dry needling' based on the biomedical hypodermic \"trigger point wet needling\" research of Dr. Janet Travell. In this work we review andevaluate the range of regulatory and certification standards for theseprofessionals' needling practices across the aforementioned jurisdictions. MethodsDrawing on the scholarly literature as well as a range of public docu-ments (in particular those published by regulatory bodies), we col- lected data pertaining to regulatory needling standards for all chiropractic and physiotherapy professionals across the UnitedStates, Australia, and Canada, where regulations govern acupuncturepractitioners. We also collected standards-related data from docu- ments published by several voluntary certification bodies for these same professionals performing therapeutic needling in the UnitedKingdom and New Zealand, where acupuncture has not been regu-lated. To gain insight into the rationale behind the identified stan- dards, we critically analysed the standards-related discourses across these documents.ResultsCertification and regulatory standards for these needling practices - where such exist -vary widely; and in many cases fall below the internationally-recognized 1999 World Health Organization acupunc-ture training standards recommended for biomedical physicians(200 hours). To justify their comparatively low standards for thera- peutic needling, physiotherapy and chiropractic groups discursively differentiate their professional needling activities from those used byother professions; and characterize their core professional trainingsas providing the substantive requirements necessary for safe need- ling practice. ConclusionsThere is an urgent need for the development of independent, inter-national training and certification standards for non-physician practi- tioners of biomedical acupuncture, to serve as a consensus document for adoption by physiotherapy and chiropractic regulatorsacross the jurisdictions under study. O52 Why do students in German medical universities select elective courses on acupuncture and homeopathy? -a survey Alexandra Jocham 1, 1): O52Question Aim of the survey was to investigate what motives students at Ger- man medical universities specify when attending elective courses onhomeopathy or acupuncture. Main focus in this piece of work is thequalitative part of the survey. Methods A cross -sectional survey throughout Germany was conducted. Med- ical students participating in courses on homeopathy or acupunctureduring the academic half-year 2013/14 were asked to take part. A questionnaire was developed consisting of four parts. The first nine- teen items were about attitudes towards complementary medicineand science, care and status orientation. The second part ( Big-Five-In- ventory-10) recorded personal characteristics. Part three asked for biographical, study- and career-related data. In the last part, studentswere asked about personal experience and environment, scientificand opportunistic aspects and the role of the therapy as a comple-ment to conventional medicine. In a free text section they could de- scribe their personal motivation in detail. ResultsMedical students in 16 of 18 acupuncture courses (n = 220) and in 12of 13 homeopathy courses (n = 113) participated. As personal state- ments in the free text section 191 acupuncture and 109 homeopathy students described the most crucial motivation for their interest inacupuncture or homeopathy.Personal experiences, way of working with patients, dissatisfaction with conventional medicine, developing a coherent approach for oneself and also scepticism with acupuncture or homeopathy wererecurrent motives. There were differences between the two groups.Conclusion Medical students interested in acupuncture or homeopathy are moti- vated by personal experiences and a desire for a complement toconventional treatment. O53 On behalf of an ethical encounter: the influence of health professionals 'training on cowling on the quality of health communicational process Morgana Masetti (morgana.ops@terra.com.br)Psychology, Pontificia Universidade Rio BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): O53 Medicine is, above all, a social s cience, a process that involves not only technical but human relationships. It\"s a place through which we can live experiences related to life, death, sufferingand loss. However, the current structure of medicine impedesthe of \"flowing\" this process. Medical training gives major focus to procedures, symptoms and te chnical knowledge, and every- thing that cannot be named unde r this knowledge framework is not incorporated in health profe ssionals\" education. In an at- tempt to reverse this situation, several groups of health stu-dents in Brazil include in their training - via university extension programs - preparatory courses to act as clowns in hospitals.Through this endeavor, the stu dents are claiming for one im- portant goal: go beyond the unive rsity\"s learning experiences; thru immersive and grounding experiences on the physicalsenses (to look, hear, touch) as w ell as on the reflection about issues such as health, illness and healing. In this communica-tion, the author share the training intervention that was devel- oped (from 1998 to 2014) in Doutores da Alegria Training Center, Brazil. By the use of games, promptness, and music im-provisation, these workshops aim to encourage the quality of health professionals\" communic ation processes. The research- action process developed around this formative experience willbe the focus of reflection. Evidence collected over 14 years ofintervention and research (based on systematic records of les-sons and evaluations conducted during this period) show the need to create care experiences for health caregivers, and to generate channels of communicat ion, joint reflection and prep- aration for the use of these fundamental skills.BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 42 of 165O54 Education with MeSaCoSa concept for healthy living and coping with chronic pain syndromesHenriette Murakozy (drmurakozy_henriette@yahoo.de)Rheumaklinik Dr. Lauven Bad Oeynhausen, 1): O54 QuestionCognitive behaviour and educative methods can play a central role in healthy living and coping with negative stress related conditionslike chronic pain syndromes and may prevent early death. Our MeSaCoSa (mens sana in cor- pore sano) medical concept for an active and conscious health management can be an important option for coping with these cir-cumstances in the modern medicine. The aim of the study was to in-vestigate the efficiency of our concept for these reasons. Methods Clinical prospective, long-time follow up study of effectiveness of theMeSaCoSa concept, at the beginning and at the end of each indoortherapy cycle and at the long-time tight control follow up ambulant control investigations. Statistical analysis: Student T probe of pain re- lief, quality of life, down-regulation of inflammation and reduction ofimpairment of motion of the inpatients at the beginning and at theend of each indoor therapy cycle and at the ambulant re-evaluations. Results Improvement and significant alleviation of pain, and inflammatorysigns and symptoms, capability for better relaxation, better life qual-ity HAQ with lower medicine consumption and fewer local cortico- steroid infiltration, effective, long lasting, analgesic and anti- inflammatory potential, relaxing to 6,6 months after emission (p <0,05), long-time change of life-style & prevention.Conclusions Beneficial role of behavioural education for healthy living with MeSa- CoSa concept, completed with a complex physical therapy regimeand acupuncture (as a part of TCM) on negative stress related condi-tions and chronic pain disorders. Our concept is recommended to prevent or to treat these circumstances, generally for conserve and preserve health, enhance life quality, acquisition capability andmaybe for preventing early death as well. O55 Mind-Body Medicine as a pathway for an improved connection with self and the world around: results from a phenomenological study among medical and nursing studentsMarja Van Vliet 1, Mats Jong2, Miek Jong3 1Department Sciences, Mid Sweden University, Sundsvall, SE- 85170, Sweden;2Department of Nursing, Mid Sweden University, Sundsvall, Sweden;3Department of Healthcare and Nutrition, 1): O55 PurposeTo obtain an in-depth understanding of the meaning of participation in a Mind-Body Medicine Skills (MBM) course in personal and profes- sional lives of medical and nursing students.MethodThe MBM course was adapted from the program developed at Georgetown University and included experiential sessions of various mind-body techniques, such as mindfulness meditation, guided im-agery, bio-feedback. Eleven medical and fourteen nursing studentsshared their lived experiences with the course in in-depth interviews which were analyzed using a hermeneutical phenomenological method. The study was conducted next to an intervention study thatevaluated the effects on stress, empathy and self-reflection.Results The essential meaning was that participation in the MBM course was a pathway to inner awareness and supported in connecting with thesurrounding world. Students described that the course gave themthe opportunity to experience calmness and that they gained the ability to be more present in their personal and professional lives. The course led to an increased awareness of themselves and theiremotions and was a barrier opener for further personal growth. In-creased perception of their inner world made them more conscious of the impact of their behavior on others. Sharing of personal stories fostered them to connect on a deeper level with others, which theyregarded helpful to better understand their patients.Conclusion Participation in the MBM course fostered medical and nursing stu- dents' perception of themselves and made them more connected tothe world around. This experience stimulated participants for furtherpersonal growth in their personal and professional lives. Traditional healing systems O56Energy healing for cancer patient - does their perception of cancerchange Rita Agdal (riag@hib.no) Health and social sciences, Bergen University College, Bergen, 5020,Norway BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): to investigate energy healers` (spiritual healers) perception ofcancer, illness and health. Secondly, how they might influence their patients perception of cancer, illness and health. MethodsI used a cultural phenomenological methodology for interviews andanalysis. 25 energy healers were interviewed (semi-structured) to identify key metaphors in their description of illness, health and can- cer. 32 patients diagnosed with cancer were interviewed four times(30 minutes to three hours) to identify changes in perception: beforethe first treatment with energy healing, after the first treatment, after one and three months. The patient interviews were analysed to iden- tify key metaphors and changes in their description of their illness,health and cancer, and compared to the metaphors used by the en-ergy healers. Results Energy healers have distinct perceptions of cancer, illness and healththat involve a focus on the energy body, as well as causes and curesfor cancer. The patients started to use the key metaphors used by energy healers to describe illness, health and cancer, after several visits to the energy healers. Some patients thought about this as aprocess of learning and some changed their health behavior.Conclusions The patients perception of illness and health in general, and can- cer in particular, changed as the energy healers treated them.Further, these changes in perception lead to changes in healthbehavior. In some cases the changes in perception influenced the way patients interpreted their own health condition and what would be considered symptoms of cancer from a biomedicalperspective. O57 Traditional Persian herbal remedies for M. Jaladat, Leila Hoseini, O57 PurposeThe increasing prevalence of asthma and lack of strong prevention and curative treatment for it has increased seeking for complemen- tary and alternative medicine therapies including Traditional PersianMedicine (TPM). In this study, through investigation of TPM refer-ences, we aimed to identify medicinal plants for treatment of asthma.BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 43 of 165Methods In this qualitative study, entities about asthma were checked under reliable sources of traditional Persian medicine, and recommendedmedicinal plants were extracted from the books. Likewise, for investi-gating the pharmacological properties of offered herbs electronic da- tabases such as PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and some Iranian databases like SID and IranMedex were employed.ResultsAncient Iranian scholars, including Avicenna have discussed asthma in their books in a chapter entitled Rabv. It has been defined as a chronic disabling dyspnea with periodic attacks like epilepsy. Mucousaccumulation in the lung is the main etiologic factor, although in rarecases depending on patient symptoms and trigger factors lung dry- ness is considered as the cause with different therapeutic approach. Honey, and medicinal herbs such as Hyssopus are among the most common remedies in the management of mucous based dis- ease, while Goat milk, Barley, Cydonia oblonga, Astragalus sp., and Violette odorante are prescribed for dry cases. Conclusions TPM prescribes medicinal plants for asthma based on each patients symptoms and trigger factors. This review will provide new research ideas based on TPM for herbal anagement of asthma. O58 Analysis on clinical symptom regularity and medication rules ofherbal prescriptions for pneumonia in preschool children treated by traditional Chinese medicine based on apriori and clustering algorithmChen Bai, Tiegang Liu, Jingnan Xu, XuanWang, He Yu, Xiaohong Gu Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 100029, China Correspondence: Xiaohong Gu analyze the clinicalsymptom regularity and medication rules inherbal prescriptions for pneumonia in preschool children treated bytraditional Chinese medicine (TCM) on the basis of using traditional Chinese medicine inheritance support system (TCMISS). MethodsThe clinicalsymptoms and herbal prescriptions for pneumonia in pre-school children treated by TCM were collected from the literatures in China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI), and then the data were entered into TCMISS. And the symptom regularity and medicationrules were analyzed by the unsupervised data mining methods suchas apriori algorithm and complex system entropy clustering in order to find the core symptom profile and new symptom as well as the core medication profile and new prescriptions. Moreover, there wasthe network association among the symptoms, syndrome and Chin-ese medications. Results Based on the analysis of 136 medicalrecords and 133 herbal prescrip-tions from 59 cases, the occurrence frequency of each symptom andthe association rules among the symptoms were determined. There were 12 core symptom profiles and 6 new symptoms with the car- dinal symptoms as follows: 1. Yellow sticky phlegm; 2. Dry lips andcrimson tongue; 3. Fever and asthma; Nasal obstruction 5. Scanty sputum; 6. Sputum hard to expector- ate and paroxysmal cough. As for the medications, there were 12 core medication profiles and 6 new prescriptions with the mainherbs as followings: 6. Pugongying (Herba Taraxaci).ConclusionFor the preschool children with pneumonia, respiratory infection symptoms with damp-heat nature are with the highest occurrence frequency. And the commonly used traditional Chinese medicineswere the exterior-releasing medications, the heat-clearingmedications, the yin-nourishing medications and the phlegm- resolving and asthma-relieving medications. O59 Insomnia in Nimrouzi2, Tafazoli2 1Student Research of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran, Islamic Republic of;2Traditional Persian Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran, Islamic Republic ofCorrespondence: Insomnia is a commom complaint in out-patient clinics. It usually af-fects quality of life negatively specially in severe cases. Nowadays,routine medical interventions comprise pharmacological approaches and cognitive behavioural therapy. Commonly used medications for the afflicted patients are not competent enough beside their annoy-ing side effects. It would naturally denotes the need for consideringnovel strategies for treating insomniac patients. Approach to insom- nia in traditional Persian medicine (TPM) has been cited in a scruti- nized manner focusing on its main causes. Accordingly, its treatmentis tailored based on the constitution of the patient, intensity of thedisease, and type of the cause. This study aimed at defining the causes of insomnia, diagnostic approach, and various medical inter- ventions proposed in valid sources of TPM. O60 Assessment of the impact of traditional Persian medicine lifestyle recommendations in the treatment of chronic constipation, arandomized controlled clinical trialSeyed Medicine, Shiraz University of medical BackgroundTo manage chronic constipation, numerous lifestyle modification schemes and recommendations as well as applications of natural me- dicaments have been mentioned in manuscripts of traditional Persianmedicine (TPM). This study was aimed to compare the impacts ofsome of those recommendations with lactulose, on functional chronic constipation. MethodsVia a blocked randomization, 100 patients were enrolled. Schemesand recommendations from TPM as intervention group were evalu- ated versus lactulose as control by weekly follow-ups with standard questionnaire for 3 months. Stool frequency, hard stool, painfuldefecation, incomplete evacuation sensation, anorectal obstructionsensation and manual maneuvers were considered as outcome measures. ResultsEighty-six patients (42 in schemes and 44 in lactulose groups) com-pleted the study. Median weekly stool frequency in 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment was 1.76_1.79, 2.88_0.89, 2.95_1.05 and 2.93_1.11 and2.77_1.00 in groups, respectively (p = 0.10, 0.11, 0.60, 0.51).Thirty-two (76.2%) patients in schemes and 24 (54.5%) patients in lac- tulose groups were treated at the end of the protocol as they did not meet the Rome III criteria for constipation (p = 0.04). In schemesgroup, patients reported no undesirable effects, whereas seven(15.9%) in lactulose group reported flatulence (p = 0.02). Conclusions Studied schemes were as effective as lactulose, a gold standard tomanage constipation. Results demonstrated that TPM schemes andrecommendations, as lifestyle modification, for at least 3 months can be introduced as cheap, available and accessible approaches for the management of constipation.BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 44 of 165Keywords: clinical trial, constipation, lactulose, lifestyle modifications, Persian, traditional medicine. O61 Kkulu Ola Hou. Reconstructing the native Hawaiian medical inventory based on traditional and contemporary K naka iwi perceptions of illness and disease Kealoha Fox (kealohaf@oha.org) John A Burns School of Medicine, Office of Hawaiian Affairs & Universityof Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, 96817, Hawaii, United States 2017, 17(Suppl 1): O61 PurposeMedical ethnohistories suggest a deep and rich philosophy ofhealth and sciences ancestral to the ancient practices of K naka iwi (Native Hawaiians (NH)). The objective of this exploratory qualitative health study examines the customs, rituals, and prac-tices relating to Hawaiian ma i, or NH conceptualizations of ill- ness, sickness and disease, and produced an inventory of findings. This research is motivated by the desire to apply trad- itional Hawaiian systems of health and medicine to the analysisand resolution of clinical questions.Methods Hawaiian research processes were developed to conduct this mixed method study across eight arms before validating bothtraditional and contemporary knowledge and beliefs. An inductivequalitative method based on in-depth open-ended interviews was undertaken. Primary data collection consisted of key informant in- terviews (N = 26) and one focus group (N = 27). The key informantsample was selected by snowball sampling of men and womenaged 40 -85 years with expert practice in traditional Hawaiian medicine. The data were analyzed according to grounded theory.Additionally, we conducted one focus group from a cohort sam-ple of intermediate level practitioners of traditional Hawaiianmedicine. The data were analyzed according to phenomenology procedures. Secondary data collection, synthesis and analyses were conducted in English and lelo Hawai i( H a w a i i a nL a n - guage) utilizing over 100,000 records in multiple Hawaiian king-dom era archives (N = 11). Results Study significance i ndicates the first co mprehensive manual documenting knowl edge of Hawaiian ma i. Comparative analysis from the primary participants confirmed ma ifrom secondary sources through novel collectio ns. Using robust data analysis techniques, we systematically coded more than 1,000 uniqueHawaiian ma ibased on the ancestral taxonomy unique to the traditional Hawaiian health system. Several specific ma iw i l lb e shared to illustrate the etiological context to these findings. Pre-liminary analysis of qualitative feedback demonstrated enthusi-asm for the project across the study contributors andstakeholders. Conclusion This unprecedented study documents the etiology and diagnos-tics of ailments, illness, sickness and disease from a traditionalsystem of mauli ola loa . Hawaiian ma iprovide an epistemological framework of pathologies which are culturally shaped and enableus to examine the links between culture, history, and biologicaldisease, which together generate lhui(population-based) imbal- ance. Qualitative findings suggest this integrative medical inven- tory can inform diagnostic process and improve diagnosis procedures for NH health care. Further, it can create new qualitystandards for culturally and linguistically appropriate services forNH health.[University of Hawaii Human Subjects Protection review approved CHS#23530]O62Europe-wide pilot field testing the Traditional Medicine (TM) Chapter of the ICD-11John Hughes 1, Nenad Kostanjsek2, St\u00e9phane Espinosa2, George Lewith3, 1Royal UCLH NHS Trust, London, WC1N 3HR, United Kingdom;2World United Kingdom Correspondence: John Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): World Health Organisation recently developed International Clas- sification of Diseases codes for Traditional Medicine (TM ICD-11). TheTM ICD-11 codes are based on a unified set of traditional medicinedisorders and patterns based on national classifications from China, Japan and Korea. The primary objective of the study was to pilot field test the TM ICD-11 codes.MethodsMixed methods approach including, online European survey of prac- titioner views on TM ICD-11 codes; coding process of case study vi- gnettes to establish inter-rater reliability; and survey of codersexperiences of using TM ICD-11 codes.Results 127 online survey questionnaires completed. Key findings included, the majority of participants agreed the TM ICD-11 codes provide ameaningful way to classify TM disorders and patterns (76%); believedtheir patients diagnosis can be represented within the TM ICD-11 codes (73%); believed the distinction between TM disorders and pat- terns was clear (77%); and did not feel any categories were mis-placed (93%). 15 European acupuncturists coded 5 case studyvignettes and provided details on their experiences of using the TM ICD-11 codes. Key findings included, participants perceived the TM ICD-11 codes as being of greatest use for communicating with col-leagues/professionals; the main added value of the TM ICD-11 codescould be an increase in the appreciation, acceptance and integration of TM within conventional medical systems. A first attempt at asses- sing the inter-rater reliability of diagnoses of case study vignettesshowed a low level of agreement.Conclusions The findings indicate European TM practitioners perceive the TM ICD-11 codes as valuable, conceptually accurate, and easy to learn. O63 Principles & factors of safest use of Unani drugs in the light ofpharmacoviglance Abdul Latif (abdullatifamu@gmail.com) University, Department of O63 UnnMedicine is said to have a holistic approach; it refers to the whole knowledge as a total recognition of the patients condition. Isthere any rationality in its principles, is the first question to answer? Looking at the concept and principles of Un nMedicine, it is clear that it does not interfere with physiologically inherent forces of medi- catrix naturae , that is of self-preservation. The purpose of Un n Medicine is to assist natural recuperative power and thus eradicatethe disease from the human body. Factors associated with preventable adverse drug reactions (ADRs) ina Unani Medicine hospital patient population are well documented.The data were collected by concurrent review of all ADRs reported by Unani Physician in their literature as patient details, ADR variables,BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 45 of 165length of stay, and preventability of ADR.

O64 Acupuncture Evidence Based Medicine Practice for StrokeRehabilitationDonald Lefeber, William Paske Memorial Hermann/Community Medical Foundation TX, United StatesCorrespondence: 1): O64 QuestionResearch has been done to assess efficacy and effectiveness of acu-puncture, however, there is still much to learn about its mechanisms and treatment effects for stroke rehabilitation [1,2]. An exploratory research study using RU-FitTM [3,4] medical devicetested; is it possible to obtain physical measurements of Fine MotorControl (FMC) that directly correlate to acupuncture treatment and protocol and perhaps coincide with treatment outcomes? A case is presented \u201470 year-old male that suffered from stroke 3 years ago \u2014hemorrhagic infarction left thalamus. Methods Throughout three months of acupuncture treatments subject was tested before and after acupuncture with FDA-approved medical in-strument RU-Fit , to obtain measurements based on FMC, reaction time, hand strength and coordination variation. Results Right hand FMC measurements originated at 48% (Normal Probabil-ity) and fluctuated between 34%-86% through first 5 weeks. In lastmonth, FMC measurements appeared in upper 80-90 percentile. Left hand FMC measurements originated at 77%. Within first 4 treatments increased to 98% and maintained in high 90th percentile for durationof acupuncture treatment period. Observed treatment outcomes dur-ing treatment period were slightly improved gait, increased coordin- ation and grip in both hands. ConclusionDifficulty exists to track improvements and/or changes forstroke rehabilitation. FMC physical measurements are attribut- able to acupuncture. Data indicates treatment outcomes are a function of acupuncture point selection, treatment frequency.Having a device to objective ly measure changes in FMC may aid in: producing more optimal treatment protocol and out- comes for patients, inspiring in creased treatment compliance, understanding the effectiveness/efficacy of acupuncture for stroke rehabilitation.Citations 1.

In other words, various points and zones stimulated via the active use of \"hand passes, touchings and tapings\" during hypnotic induction coincide inherently withYNSA microsystem.Results The inherent relationship of YNSA with AUCH\u00a9 Method is analyzed by mapping YNSA zones & points coinciding with the hypnotic appli-cation areas induced spontaneously during hypnotic induction.Conclusions The mapping illustrating the inherent relationship of various YNSA acupuncture zones & points with hypnotic application areas summa-rizes the similarities of YNSA microsystem and AUCH\u00a9 acupuncture, Conscious Hypnosis (AUCH\u00a9),Medical Medicine. Various topics O66The development of an evidence-based decision aid concerningComplementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) for parents of children with cancer Inge Boers 1, Wim Tissing2, Marianne Cancer O66 QuestionCAM is often used by parents of children with cancer to reduce side- effects of regular treatment or to improve quality of life. Support isneeded for making well-informed decisions, essential for self-management, communication and shared decision making. The ob- jective of this project was to develop and implement an evidence-BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 46 of 165based decision aid concerning CAM for parents of children with can- cer, which is widely accepted by future users. MethodsThe project consisted of four phases. During phase 1 an inventorywas made on the current state of information and needs of parents. Literature and internet searches, questionnaires and focus group dis- cussions with parents and healthcare professionals were used. Duringphase 2 content of evidence was gathered based on a GRADE ana-lysis including systemic literature search and expert opinion. In the 3rd and 4th phase an informative website was developed, imple- mented and evaluated.ResultsLittle information sources were found for parents concerning CAM and pediatric oncology in the Netherlands. Parents underlined the importance of reliable information, especially focused on communi-cation and complaints as: fatigue, anxiety, pain and sleeping prob-lems. A GRADE analysis was performed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of CAM for pain. Evidence of good quality was found for hypnotherapy in contrast to moderate to low qualityfor other CAM. Chosen form of decision aid was an informative web-site for parents, embedded in regular care. Conclusion A start was made on the development of an evidence-based inform-ative website for parents, focused on the complaint pain. Next stepswill be to extend the website with evidence for CAM on other cancer-related complaints. This project was a unique collaboration of patients, healthcare professionals and researchers. O67 From virtuality to repeatable patterns: consciousness as thegoverning software Babak Daneshfard 1, Mohammad R Sanaye2 1Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Student Research Committee, Shiraz, Iran, Islamic Republic of;2Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Essence of Parsiyan Wisdom Institute, Phytopharmaceutical Technologyand Traditional Medicine Incubator, Republic of 1): O67 The consciousness field as manifested through a series of treatmentsnot normally obtainable by conventional methods, has been thepivot of so many papers, articles, and reviews by the Iranian traditionof mind-body healing (most recently named: Faradarmani). The ap- proach in this methodology would be the mending of \"software structuration\" rather than making attempts to focus on merely mater-ial hardware. Accordingly, consciousness is described to be the differ-ential field of constant repeatability by means of which not only the blueprints of living entities are provided, but also the mannerism of their probable repairing is to be set down.In addition, immunity could also be elucidated by means of the samefield(s) that are present to return likely abnormalities back to their original natural state. The very fact that not all vectors of pathogens fall victims to varieties of diseases, might be evidence to the noveltheory of \"consciousness immunity\". There is, of course, the capacityto link on to such consciousness field(s) for purposes of activating so many potentialities including repair, fractal correction, and medical treatment.Room is undoubtedly extant for basic and applied multidisciplinaryinvestigation when it comes to scientifically expanding upon the re- peatable patterns of existence and curing throughout the cosmos of entities \u2014be they of the animal kingdom, plant kingdom, human be- ings, or even non-living materials.O68 Induction of coherent fields in osteopathic treatment proposes to be potential by influencing the genetic fieldKilian Dr\u00e4ger (draeger@daego.de)D\u00c4GOsteopathy, Hamburg, Germany BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): O68 The genetic code was seen as stable reference of the body that guar-antees cell identity and health. Now the genetic code shows up with much higher variability, more like a genetic mosaic. The genome dif- fers even from conception to birth, with every cell division.Transposons take an important part in that process and they are reg-ulated by some molecules. How does a molecule make its decision of building in or keeping out a tranposon? Where does the body rely on?The body expresses itself in motion, analyzed in direction, force andfrequency. Micro- and macromotion can be described as multidimen- sional coherent oscillation via molecules, cells, tissues and functional organs.E.g. connective tissue has this physiologic steady circle of declineand reconstruction with various processes such as signal transduc- tion, metabolic function and mechanisms for compensation and stabilization of body integrity [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. All functions can beseen as motion, as change from one state to another.Physiologic motions are going to be synchronized. Dysfunction oc- curs by divergence and incoherence. The decision of assimilation or separation of a transposon or any partof the body could be made by identifying a divergence in a coherentoscillation field, like identifying a divergent instrument in an playing orchestra. It isnt able for coherent oscillation. Osteopathic treatment is aiming for reintegration of divergent zonesinto the coherent field(s) of the body. This is implemented bybalanced-techniques, which use a simple general physical option of synchronization: connection and freedom of movement. References 1.

It has important implications for inte- grative medicine. The terms \"Traditional Medicine\" (TM) and \"Trad-itional and Complementary Medicine\" (T&CM) are It has strong support from Director-General Dr Mar- garet Chan who said that T&CM is an important and often underesti- mated part of health care; there is a need for a cohesive andintegrative approach that allows governments, practitioners andusers to access T&CM in a safe and effective manner; and that pro- active policy towards this important often vibrant and expanding part of health care is required.The goals of the strategy are to harness the potential contribution ofT&CM and to promote its safe and effective use. The objectives are in terms of policy: integrating T&CM into national health care sys- tems; safety, efficacy and quality; access to increase availability andaffordability; rational use by practitioners and consumers. Challengesinclude integration of T&CM into universal health coverage (UHC) and primary health care (PHC), lack of research, communication, and reliable information for consumers. The integrative medicine commu-nity is a key stakeholder in this strategy. Actions recommended forstakeholders include: establishing best practice; recommending re- search priorities; advising on risks and benefit; promoting a culture of communication, evaluation, education and innovation; increasingthe availability of literature, database and other knowledge resources;developing research methods consistent with T&CM concepts; build- ing research capacity and promoting international collaboration in- cluding protection of intellectual property.WHO has developed ICD-11 codes for oriental TM diagnoses. It isreviewing the safety of T&CM practices, starting with acupuncture. Conclusions The WHO TM strategy is an important opportunity to encourage offi-cial and funding bodies to support integration in UHC and PHC andresearch. We should emphasise our strengths including effective, safe, popular, economical, eco-friendly treatments which harness nat- ural healing; continue to strengthen the knowledge base; promotecommunication; develop and disseminate effective models of inte-gration in UHC and PHC. Establishing accessible databases to inform evidence-based policy on integration particularly in middle and low income countries is a high priority. O70 Food literacy and attitudes in a healthy population of US adultsMary J Kreitzer, Roni Evans, Brent Leininger, Kate Shafto, Jenny Breen Center for Spirituality & Healing, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, United StatesCorrespondence: Mary J 17(Suppl 1): O70 QuestionThis study focused on factors related to food literacy and healthyeating behaviors in adults including individuals knowledge of healthy food choices; confidence related to food choices and preparation; and preferences for education. Obesity is one of the most seriouspublic health challenges of the 21st century and is among the lead-ing causes of deaths globally. Methods The population surveyed included a convenience sample of adults(18 of age and over) who agreed to complete a survey on an iPadwhile attending a large public event. Results 659 adults who participated in the study were primarily female(69%), well educated (62% with 4 year college degree or above, andhealthy (66% described themselves as healthy or very healthy). Des- pite being confident in their ability to chose healthy food (70%), scores revealed a lack of food literacy. For example, less than 1/2knew the USDA Healthy Plate recommendation around the percentof food that should be fruit and vegetables and that transfat is the least healthy fat to consume. Slightly over a 1/3 reported that they cook food daily for themselves. Factors preventing them from eatinghealthy foods include lack of time, willpower and a demanding workor travel schdedule. The sources of information that most influenced eating were family and friends (81%), followed by health profes- sionals (45%) and TV cooking shows (35%).ConclusionConsumer food literacy and reported barriers to healthy eating likely contribute to unhealthy eating and the public health problems asso- ciated with obesity and chronic disease. O71 HCT (Holistic Clinical Trials) and ICT (Integrative Clinical Trials)Mohammad R Sanaye 1, Babak Daneshfard2 1Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Essence of Parsiyan Wisdom Institute, Phytopharmaceutical Technology and Traditional MedicineIncubator, Shiraz, Iran, Islamic Republic of;2Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Traditional Persian Medicine, Shiraz, Iran, Islamic Republic of Correspondence: Babak 1): O71 Any holistic medicine, if it is to be truly holistic, cannot possibly takethe policy of escapism from Clinical Trials. The intention to design ex- perimental trials on animals before coming over to humankind hasbeen focused on to procreate the most state-of-the-art clinical holistic medicine. Thus, split-plots [and even: split-split plots] are brought at work to employ the full efficiency of Bayesian statistics for purposes of holistically infer posterior likelihood in casesof predictions based on priors. This spells that on the on the onehand clinical trials are not necessarily to be of randomized nature. On the other hand, the basic ideas of HCT [Holistic Clinical Trials] and ICT [Integrative Clinical Trials] by means of incorporating Algebraic-Topologic notions (rather than simple numerically crunched dataanalysis) into the main body of any trial of clinical essence, thence, emerges to be the most applicable handy clinical trials of near-future medicine. O72 Organic food consumption during pregnancy and its association with health-related characteristics: the KOALA Birth Cohort Study Ana Arlesheim, Arlesheim, Switzerland;3 Epidemiology,CAPHRI Maastricht, NetherlandsCorrespondence: Ana P 17(Suppl While evidence for health-related benefits of consuming organicfoods is scarce, their consumption has been shown to be often ac- companied by specific food patterns. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the consumption of organic food duringpregnancy and accompanying food pattern are associated with se-lected health-related characteristics and biomarkers. Blood from 1339 pregnant women participating in the KOALA Birth Cohort Study as well as information on demographic, lifestyle,health-related and diet characteristics was collected and analysed.Participants were grouped depending on whether none (reference group), less than 50%, between 50% and 90%, or more than 90% of the consumed food was of organic origin.Consumption of organic food was associated with a more favourablepre-pregnancy BMI and a lower prevalence of gestational diabetes. Plasma levels of ferritin, homocysteine, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and plasma triglycerides were lower in the organic groups than in the ref-erence group. Plasma phospholipid levels of several fatty acids dif-fered among the various groups. Compared with the reference group, markers of the intake of trans fatty acids from natural originBMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 48 of 165(e.g. vaccenic and rumenic acid) were higher in the organic groups, whereas elaidic acid, a marker of the intake of trans fatty acids found in industrially hydrogenated fats was lower. The lower intake of animal products previously observed in the or-ganic groups is likely to play a role in the differences found in bio- marker levels. Potential health-related effects of a diet associated with the consumption of organic food are discussed. O73 101: practical strategies for creating a successful integrative medicine and health programShelley White (shelley.white@hci.utah.edu)Huntsman Cancer Institute/University of Utah, Wellness and Integrative Health Center, Salt Lake City, UT, United States BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): O73 Since many presentations evaluate integrative program offeringsthrough scientific abstracts, this presentation will offer practical strat- egies and instruction on how to set up successful program services.This session will provide descriptive details about how the presenterwas able to increase integrative health and medicine services at the Huntsman Cancer Institute, an NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center, at the University of Utah from five program offerings to forty programofferings for patients, caregivers, and staff within a five-year period.Total visits increased by nearly 800% from 2,310 in 2013 to 18,375 in 2016. The Wellness and Integrative Health Center at the Huntsman CancerInstitute offers forty services to people affected by cancer. Uniquely,therapeutic services are offered on site, within our clinical medical setting. Services include: acupuncture, art, bone health/osteoporosis, clinical hypnosis, cooking demonstration classes, core & stretch, cre-ative and expressive writing, cranial sacral therapy, dance, energymedicine, cancer exercise fitness therapy, group circuit training, inte- grative oncology consultations, Jin Shin Jyutsu, Laugh/Live out Loud, Good-Feel Better, massage therapy, mind-body medical inter-ventions (meditation, mindfulness-based practices), music therapy,narrative therapy (life story recordings), nutritional counseling, osteo- pathic manipulation treatments, Pilates mat, Physiatrist visits, Qigong, resistance training, road-biking, rowing, running, snow-shoeing, Tai-Chi, weight reduction, yoga, yogalates, and Zumba\u00aeThe presenter is currently working with the Chief Wellness Officer, the Associate Vice President for Health Equity and Inclusion, the Medical Director for Supportive Oncology and Survivorship, a Distin-guished Professor in the College of Nursing and investigator and co-leader of Cancer Control and Population Sciences at the Huntsman Cancer Institute, the Director of Nursing and Patient Care Services, the Associate Dean of Research for the Graduate School of SocialWork, the Associate Vice President for the Art, and the AssociateDean of Research for the Arts to bring campus clinical programs into additional health care and community settings to provide additional clinical, educational, and research opportunities. The communityspace will offer arts, wellness, psychosocial service as well all of theintegrative health services we currently offer on-site with the addition of an arts installation space; performance space; a counsel- ing center (for psychosocial services); a recording studio for musictherapy, spoken word, and life stories; group fitness and dancespace; additional exercise and research space, and medical follow-up clinic space for patients who need post-treatment follow-up. The presenter also managed Patient and Family Support (emotional, spir-itual, and practical services). O74 The broken link! Combining conventional and complementarymedicine in a safe health care chain Solveig Wiesener, Anita Salamonsen, Trine 1): O74Question The aim of the study is to analyze how a combination of conven- tional medicine and CAM (complementary and alternative medicine)may affect patient safety, and investigate whether the concurrentuse of CAM threatens patient safety in conventional health care services. MethodsWe have reanalyzed the EU FP7 CAMbrella data collected on regula-tion of CAM in 39 countries in Europe and the European Union (EU), and supplemented this with recent emerging knowledge in the area. ResultsThe World Health Organization (WHO) and the EU have both givenpriority to safety and patients\" right to choose treatment. Conse- quently, the regulation of national health care services in many coun- tries focuses on strengthening patient safety and highlights patients\"right to choose safe and suitable treatment. Moreover, public patientsafety strategies, especially within cancer treatment, highlight \"a safe pathway of treatment\". About 40% of Norwegian patients combine CAM and conventional treatment, and surveys conducted in Europedemonstrate the same trend.We found, however, insufficient documentation on safety and risk as- pects when patients combine CAM and conventional medicine. The risks and safety challenges include lack of communication betweenhealth personnel, patients and CAM providers, negative interactionsbetween herbal and medicinal products and insufficient patient in- formation. Further, there are challenges with regard to supervision, claims and reimbursement.ConclusionsCombining CAM and conventional medicine may influence patient safety. There are risk and safety challenges due to disharmonized regulation, unclear treatment standards, insufficient patient informa-tion and lack of communication between health care professionalsand CAM providers. Posters Research P1Cobalamin (vitamin B12) functional status is not correctly assessed by common biomarkers being used: 2 case reports and a review of 1, Mar Blanco2, Laia Masllorens1, are usually measured.MethodsHigh plasma cobalamin levels in spite of suspected low cobalamin functional status were found in 2 clinical cases. Clinical symptoms and additional biomarkers of cobalamin low status were assessed. In-testinal dysbiosis was also tested by the KyberKompaktPRO test. Re-view of the literature included the European Food Safety Authoritys position document on reference values for cobalamin. PubMed data- base was also reviewed (September 2016). Key words included co-balamin, holotranscobalamin, vitamin b12, dysbiosis and Small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth. Results Standard serum cobalamin concentration comprises both the func-tional and the inert fractions of cobalamin and refers typically only tostandardised cyanocobalamin levels. Cut-off values have not yet been clearly defined and are not correlated with functional status. In the 2 patients described, in spite abnormally high levels, clinical signsBMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 49 of 165of cobalamin low-status were found in conjunction with tHcy abnor- mal high values. Intestinal dysbiosis was also present. Resolution of dysbiosis and administration of methyl-cobalamin normalised cobala-min levels and improved clinical status in the 2 cases reported.Conclusions Measurement of serum cobalamin levels alone is not an adequate method to assess cobalamin functional status. A combination of bio-markers including HoloTC is more suitable for assessing functionalcobalamin status. Cobalamin plasma concentrations could be falsely raised in several medical conditions where low cobalamin functional status is present. Correct treatment of intestinal dysbiosis could leadto improvements in cobalamin functional status.Written informed consent for the publication of these details was previously obtained from the participants. P2 Factors influencing self-care behaviors (Khat use) among College of Medicine, Seoul, 133-791, South Korea; 2Global Health and Development, Hanyang University, College Medicine, Seoul, 04763, South Korea Correspondence: PurposeWorldwide, diabetes Mellitus (DM) is becoming a big challenge, par- ticularly the prevalence of DM is higher in Arab regions than globalaverage with predominance of type II DM. Self-care as a cost-effective intervention was presented as a solution of diabetes pre- vention and management by WHO and AADE. Diabetic individuals in- dependently make decision and different life activities to maintaintheir health condition, prevent DM related complications and im-prove life quality. Good diabetes self-care behaviors can be affected by many factors, including social, cultural, financial and health care system. However, to our best knowledge, factors influencing diabetesself-care behaviors hasnt been investigated among Yemeni diabeticpatients.The Aim of this study wasto provide an overview of self-care behaviors among type II DM Yemeni patients, and expound the affect factors and barriers of self-care behaviors among them.MethodologyA descriptive cross-sectional study was designed. 350 participants were out-patients, who were approached in 4 major public govern- mental hospital (Al-Gumhouri, Al-Thawra and Al-Kuwait hospital andthe University of Science & Technology Hospital) and 1 major privatehospital in Sanaa City(capital city), during 5th October to 10th No- vember, 2015. A questionnaire was developed with 5 parts, including Self-care Behaviors, Diabetic Characteristics, Barriers of Self-care Be-haviors, Knowledge level of DM and social- demographic characteris-tics. Data collected through face to face interview survey, then coded and analyzed with Excel and SPSS software 21. Chi-square was used to test association between self-care behaviors and independentsvariables.Results Only 28.5% of patients had good self-care behavior score, most of them had fair to poor self-care. Taking medicine, general diet and ex-ercise were the most taking self-care behaviors among good self-care behavior patients. Specifically, over half of patients reported they were chewing Khat, among them 41.9% take Khat every day. The biggest barriers of self-care behaviors was insecure situation, fol-lowing were lack of transportation and lack of electricity. Analyzingwith Chi-square, house-hold income, whether having Glucometer, Meal plan, snacks per day and DM duration were factors influencing the self-care behaviors.ConclusionType II diabetes patients in Yemeni have not good self-care behav- iors. Taking medicine is the most self-care behavior, but testing blood glucose was the lowest. It emphasizes the role of health careworkers to support patients with required knowledge and skills to improve their health outcome.

Spe-cial emphasis was placed on patient participation and patient empowerment. The aim of this qualitative study was to describe per- sonal feedback on mental, emotional, and bodily experiences withthe program.Methods Qualitative data were drawn from the study participants (n = 18) from the three intervention groups. Four open questions were asked aspart of a anonymized questionnaire, which presented a possibility todescribe personal experiences with the IMCR program. The question- naires were sent back to the research team in sealed envelopes. Ana- lysis method was systematic text condensation.ResultsMost participants were very satisfied with the program. They appreci- ated the resource oriented focus of the program. After completion of the training, many participants integrated relaxation and breathingexercises into their daily lives and reported calmness and a morepositive view on life. Conclusion Data from this qualitative study suggests that a program withseveral modalities such as life style advices, complementary ther-apies, relaxation exercises and stress management tools is benefi- cial for chronically ill patients with amalgam attributed health complaints. Beyond that, we conclude that the IMCR programcan be useful for chronically ill patients with a similar symptomprofile.

No clear evi- dence for Echinacea (4 trials) or an herbal compound prepar- ation (1 trial) in preventing RTI symptoms was found. Meta-analysis revealed evidence for efficacy (responder rates: risk ratio[RR] = 2.56; 95% I 2= 38%; 2= 9.63; P = 0.14) safety (patients with adverse events: RR = 1.06; 95% 10.64; P = 0.01) of Pelargonium sidoides in treating respiratory tract infection symptoms compared to pla- cebo (6 trials). ConclusionDue to the heterogeneity of the included studies no concrete conclu-sion on preventive effects of Echinacea could be drawn so far. In case of pelargonium sidoides a performed meta-analysis revealed moderate evidence for efficacy and safety in the treatment of re-spiratory tract infections in children. P5 A systematic review and meta-analysis of mindfulness-based stress reduction for treating low back University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, 45276, Germany;2 University of Technology Sydney, Australian Research Centre inComplementary and Integrative Medicine (ARCCIM), Sydney, AustraliaCorrespondence: P5 QuestionMindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is frequently used in treating pain conditions. While meta-analyses on MBSR for chronic pain have been conducted, no meta-analysis specifically for low backpain is available.Methods Medline/PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO were screened through June 2016. Only randomized controlled trials(RCTs) were included when they assessed the effects of MBSR in pa-tients with a diagnosis of low back pain. Usual care (no specific treat- ment) or any active treatments were acceptable as control interventions. For each outcome, standardized mean differences(SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Risk of biaswas assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Primary outcome measures were pain intensity and pain disability. Health-related qual- ity of life, pain acceptance, mindfulness, and safety were defined assecondary outcomes.Results Seven RCTs, involving 864 low back pain patients, proved eli- gible for review. Compared to usual care, MBSR was associatedwith short-term improvements in pain intensity (4 RCTs; MeanDifference (MD) = -0.96 points on a numeric rating scale; 95%CI = -1.64,-0.34; Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) = -0.48 95%CI = -0.82,-0.14) 95%CI= 0.90,4.10; SMD = 0.09,0.41) that were not sus-tained long-term. Between-group differences in disability, mental health, pain acceptance and mindfulness were not significant at short- or long-term follow-up. Compared to an active compara-tor, MBSR was not associated with any significant differences inshort- or long-term outcomes. No serious adverse events were reported. ConclusionsThere is promising evidence of short-term efficacy and safety ofMBSR in low back pain patients. While further RCTs with larger sam- ple sizes and longer follow-up periods are needed to underpin these results, MBSR can be recommended as an adjunct intervention forpatients with chronic low back pain.P6 Chinese herbal therapy compared with cryotherapy in the treatment of chronic cervicitis and Medical Sciences, Mashhad, 91359135, Iran, Islamic Republic of;2 Department of Medical Imaging, Razavi Hospital, Mashhad, 9187195786,Iran, Islamic Republic of;3Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Department Biostatistics, Mashhad, Iran, Islamic Republic ofCorrespondence: BackgroundChronic cervicitis is one of the common disorders in daily practice. We aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of Chinese herbal medicine in comparison with cryotherapy in the treatment of chroniccervicitis and cervical erosion.Materials and methods Seventy women with cervicovaginal smears class I or II without a papilloma or Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia who referred togynecology clinic of Imam Reza Hospital and Qaem Hospital, Mash-had, Iran entered the study. The experimental group received Chin- ese herbal treatment and the control group received cryotherapy. The main outcome measures were the number of treated patients,the time of recovery and side effects. All subjects were evaluated forstudy outcomes at 48 hours after treatment, week 1, 3 days after the end of menstruation, weeks 6 and 12. ResultsSeventeen and 9 patients were treated in experimental group at days 2and 7 after intervention while none of the control group showed treat- ment at those times. The number of treated patients were 29 vs 5 in ex- perimental and control groups 3 days af ter next menstruation (P < 0.001); 31 vs. 12, 6 weeks after treatment (P < 0.001); and 34 vs. 24, 12 weeksafter treatment (P < 0.001). One patient in the experimental group vs. 11 patients in the control group did not answer to the treatment (P < 0.001). The median (interquartile range) for time to treatment response was3 (4) days in the experimental group and 35 (48) in the control group(P = 0.015). Side effects including spotting, hypogastric pain, fever and yellow va- ginal discharge were observed in 15 patients in the experimentalgroup vs. 24 patients in the control group (P = 0.03). The completecure was observed in 97.1% of patients in the experimental group vs. 68.5% in the control group (P < 0.001) . Conclusions Chinese herbal therapy is suggested to be better tolerated and moresuccessful with less side effects comparing to cryotherapy for women with chronic cervicitis.

We aimed to investigate the effect of acupuncture on the chest pain of those patients.Materials and methodsForty patients with typical angina pectoris and patent coronary angiogram, whose chest pain was persistent despite medical treat- ment in maximum dosage, entered the study. They were randomlyassigned in 2 groups. The experimental group received acupuncturetreatment 3 times a week plus medication, while the control group received medication alone for 4 weeks. All patients were fallowed up 4 weeks after the end of intervention. The intensity of chest pain ac-cording to Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Canadian CardiovascularSociety Grading System (CCS), the number of weekly episodes of chest pain, the length of each pain episode and changes in ST-T seg- ment of electrocardiography were recorded at baseline, week 4 andweek 8.Results The mean (SD) of VAS score decreased from 7.2(1.4) pre-treatment to 3.1(1.4), 1.6(1.1) and 0.2(0.7) at week 2, 4 and 8 in the experimentalgroup vs. 6.1(1.5) pre-treatment to 3.9(1.1), 3.1(0.7) and 2.3(1.5) inweek 2, 4 and 8 in the control group (P < 0.001). The CCS score de- creased in 14 patients in experimental group vs. 7 patients in control group at week 2(P = 0.03), 16 vs. 10 at week 4(P = 0.01), and 18 vs. 15at week 8(P = 0.008). The mean (SD) of the number of weekly epi-sodes of chest pain decreased from 21.9(20.9) pre-treatment to 3.2(3.0), 0.1(0.8), and 0.1(0.3) at week 2, 4 and 8 in the experimental group vs. 30.8(19.5) pre-treatment to 20(17.8), 16.7(18.5) and11.7(19.3) in week 2, 4 and 8 in the control group (P = 0.001). Themean (SD) of the length of each pain episode decreased from 17.9(14.2) minutes pre-treatment to 3.8(4.2), 1.3(2.5), and 0.3(1.2) mi- nutes at week 2, 4 and 8 in the experimental group vs. 7.5(7.6) mi-nutes pre-treatment to 3(3.01), 2.3(2.2) and 1.5(1.8) minutes in week2, 4 and 8 in the control group (P = 0.001). No change was seen in the ST-T segments of patients\" electrocardiographs in both groups. The mean (SD) of systolic blood pressure changed from 130(17.3)pre-treatment to 111.3(18.3), 111.9(11.6) and 116.6(12.9) at week 2, 4and 8 in the experimental groups vs. 139.3(12.6) pre-treatment to 134.9(12.9), 131.5(12.5) and 132.8(12.3) at week 2, 4 and 8 in the con- trol group (P < 0.001).ConclusionThe intensity of chest pain, the number of weekly episodes of chest pain and the length of each pain episode decreased significantly by acupuncture treatment. Results of this study suggests that acupunc-ture could help as an adjuvant therapy in the management of chestpain of patients with patent coronary angiogram. Trial registration: IRCT201512037265N2 P8 Methodological issues interventionsErik Baars, Anja De 2333CK, medicine evidence-based, group-oriented are considered to guarantee the quality of interven-tions for conventional indications. However, whole medical system (WMS) approaches lack this group-oriented focus and are character- ized by a highly individualized diagnostic and therapeutic approach.Thus, other instruments than the group-oriented protocols andguidelines are requested to allow for guideline developments and quality assurance.MethodsThe development of two WMS (Anthroposophic Medicine) healthcare programs for patients with cancer and depression, and the literatureon WMSs, complex interventions and individualization in therapeuticprocesses was analyzed. Results The core elements of the WMS individualizing interventions are: (1) aset of consensus and evidence-based treatment phases, treatmentgoals per phase and therapies per goal; (2) professionals with trained system thinking and reflection skills who are able to judge the whole, complex and unique situation of the patient leading toindividualization in diagnostics and treatments. Additionally they areable to reflect on therapy progress and steer the therapy process accordingly. ConclusionsThe quality of individualizing WMS interventions cannot be guaran-teed by the same approach as used in group-oriented protocols and guidelines. They require identification of a set of treatment phases and related goals and therapies, and specifically trained professionalwho are able to rationally choose the best option from the redun-dant set of treatment options. Individualization of WMS interventions thus largely depends on professional clinical reasoning. P9 Complementary medicine and lifestyles in Tuscany: Tuscan network for Integrative Medicine, Florence, 50133, Italy;2Tuscan Network of Integrative Medicine- Region of Tuscany, Florence, Italy;3 Regional Health Agency of Tuscany, Florence, ItalyCorrespondence: Sonia Baccetti Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): P9 BackgroundAccording to international literature, users of CM are more active,less overweight and have healthier lifestyles.Aim To evaluate the lifestyle of patients of CM public clinics in Tuscany and compare it with general data of the surveillance system Multi-scopo in Tuscan population (Istat 2013) adjusted for sex and age.Methods In 2014 the Tuscan Network of Integrative Medicine in co-operation with the Regional Health Agency of Tuscany has distributed to 1,064patients (age >18) in public clinics of CM, anonymous questionnaireson lifestyles, that included questions on exercise, smoking, diet, alcohol. ResultsThe sample was divided according to educational level (medium-high and medium-low). All the subjects who used CM had less sed- entary habits (statistically significant) compared to controls in both groups (19% versus 26.9% medium-high educational level, 32.1% ver-sus 48% medium-low educational level). Also the consumption offruit and/or vegetables was significantly higher in 2 groups who used CM (41,2% versus 7,5% medium-high and 35,4% versus 4,5% medium-low). In the subjects with low educational level, smokingwas significantly lower (15,6% versus 23,2%) and obesity was higher(18.3% versus 11.7%) compared to the control group. Finally, in the subjects with low education who used CM prevalence of drinkers at risk was higher compared to Tuscan population (21,6% versus11,9%).Conclusions Contrary to what literature reports, lifestyles of our sample were not better in alcohol consumption and obesity. CM patients atemore fruit and vegetables, were moderately less sedentary thanTuscan population and smoked less compared to the control group.BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 52 of 165Keywords: Lifestyles; Complementary Medicine (CM); Public Regional Healthcare System P10 Expectation for acupuncture treatment (EAT): scale developmentand performanceJ\u00fcrgen Barth, Alexandra Kern, Sebastian L\u00fcthi, Claudia Witt Institute for Complementary and Integrative Medicine, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, 8006, SwitzerlandCorrespondence: J\u00fcrgen P10 BackgroundHigh expectations about acupuncture might contribute to largertreatment effects (Prady et al., 2015). However, problems in the as- sessment are well known: 1) floor or ceiling effects lower variance; 2) expectation measures include general beliefs about complementarymedicine; 3) construct validity of expectation measures remains un-clear since assessment strategies were often ad hoc developed. We aimed to develop an expectation scale for acupuncture with good re- liability, convergent validity (other expectation scales) and distinct-ness to more general constructs (like optimism).Methods In this web based survey we included 110 participants with pain. All participants filled in nine statements on expectations of which fivewere used for the final version of the Expectation for AcupunctureTreatment scale (EAT). Convergent validity was tested against the Acupuncture Expectation Scale (AES), Life Orientation Test (LOT), Pa- tient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), Sensitivity to Medication (BMQ-D),and other measures.Results Factor analysis showed a one factor solution of the EAT items and re- liability was high (alpha = 0.902). The correlation with another meas-ure of patient expectation (AES) was high. Moderate correlation of0.20 to .30 were found for LOT, PHQ and BMQ-D. No association was present for the personality characteristics neuroticism and openness to experience. Re-test reliability after one week was good (ICC > .70).ConclusionThe EAT seems to be a reliable, valid and very feasible measure for assessing acupuncture expectations in pain patients. The items can be adapted for other treatments and an English version is availableto be tested. P11 Changing expectation for acupuncture treatment (CHEAT)J\u00fcrgen Barth, Anja Zieger, Fabius Otto, Claudia WittInstitute for Complementary and Integrative Medicine, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, 8006, Switzerland Correspondence: J\u00fcrgen 17(Suppl P11 BackgroundChanging expectations by verbal suggestions might improve acu-puncture effects (Suarez-Almazor et al., 2010). However, designingappropriate communication for verbal suggestions might be a diffi- cult task. Web based experiments can be a tool to develop effective suggestions to change expectations.MethodsIn this web based study we randomly informed subjects in two dif- ferent ways with visual and written materials about the benefits of acupuncture: In the high expectation group (HE) the subjects weretold that acupuncture leads to a substantial decrease in symptoms inabout 50% of cases. In the low expectation group (LE) the partici- pants were told, that about half of the patients get better but the specific effect of acupuncture is still unclear. We included subjectswith an adequate information processing (memory task and a mini-mum reading time of 25 seconds). The strength of the message was tested with a manipulation check and the Expectation for Acupunc- ture Treatment (EAT) scale was the primary outcome.Results Of 369 subjects 244 were included in the analysis (having pain n = 78; HE n = 33, LE n = 45, having no pain n = 166; HE n = 86, LE n =80). Manipulation check was positive. For pain patients the expecta-tions did not differ between HE and LE (p > .60). For no pain subjects expectation differed between HE and LE (p = .02). This effect was ro- bust effect after controlling for sex, age, earlier acupuncture experi-ence, and health status.Conclusion Web experiments can help to make empirically based decisions on how to create persuasive messages for verbal suggestions on expec-tations. High dose communication including audio visual informationabout acupuncture might be needed for patients to have similar ef- fects like in healthy subjects. P12 Mind-body therapies University Natural Research Institute, Portland, OR, United StatesCorrespondence: Ariel Beccia and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): P12 QuestionEating disorders represent a significant public health concern. Thechallenges associated with treatment highlight the importance of prevention. Calls for increased efficacy of such programs have led to the development of novel approaches, including those incorporatingmind-body therapies. The purpose of this review is thus to assess theeffectiveness of mind-body therapies in promoting protective factors and reducing risk factors associated with eating disorders. MethodsMEDLINE, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, and AMED were screenedthrough November 2016. controlled trials (RCTs) com- paring mind-body therapies to dissonance-based or assessment-only controls were analyzed. Outcome measures included standardizedmeasures of protective and risk factors associated with eating dis-order development. For each outcome, standardized mean differ- ences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated, if at least 2 studies assessing this outcome were available. As a measureof heterogeneity, I 2was calculated. Data synthesis was completed using RevMan software and risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Controlled before-and-after and pre-post studies were also eligible, although were not included in the meta-analysis.Results Out of 1675 identified studies, 15 trials (1368 participants) were in- cluded in the meta-analysis, evaluating meditation and/ormindfulness-based therapies (10 trials), mirror-exposure therapy (2trials,) yoga (2 trials), and autogenic training (1 trial). Mind-body ther- apies may significantly reduce body image concern (SMD CI -0.66 to -0.03),and CI 0.35 to 0.81) ascompared may significantly improve self-esteem (SMD 0.80; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.23) as compared to dissonance-based controls. No significant differences were found forany other outcome measure. 5 non-randomized studies (519 partici-pants) were identified; interventions included mindfulness-based therapies and yoga, and all reported significant changes on included outcome measures.ConclusionsMind-body therapies may be an effective form of eating disorder prevention. Based the combined data from 15 RCTs, there is moder- ate evidence for the effectiveness of mind-body therapies in redu-cing risk factors and promoting protective factors associated witheating disorders. The main limitations of the studies were the lack of blinding and the variations in included interventions. A meta-analysis of outcome measures assessed at 1-month follow-up is currently be-ing conducted.BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 53 of 165P13 Chilean National Health Survey 2010-2011: chronic pain in adults and the use of complementary and alternative therapies (CAM)Paula Bedregal1, Alvaro Passi1, Alfredo Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Santiago, Chile;4Integrative S\u00f3tero del R\u00edo, Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): P13 Chronic pain is a public health problem. About 43.5% (95% CIs 38.4%to 48.6%) of population is estimated to have this condition. One thirdof Chilean population use CAM. There is no current data about use of CAM in people with chronic pain and its perceived benefits nei- ther in Chile nor in Latin America.MethodsA cross-sectional representative national survey of 5285 adults (18 years old) was interviewed directly about their use of CAM. We analyzed the frequency of CAM use, the types of CAM used, the per- ceived efficacy and factors influencing its use.Results Prevalence of chronic pain in Chile is 39.7% (95% CIs: 38.4-41.0%). Prevalence of CAM use in those with chronic pain is 42.6%, in thosewithout chronic pain is 36.1% (p = 0.0001). The most common typeof CAM used is herbal therapies (34.7%), followed by homeopathy (12.5%). The use of CAM in those with chronic pain is associated with better educational level (>12 years of studies); women (44.6% vs38.3%; \u00b1 17.3 years old;p = 0.002); and perception of poor health. Perceived efficacyis better with Herbal therapies (92%), Reiki (79.2%) and Bach 's Flowers (75%). Adjusted by educational level, only gender and age is associated to use of CAM among adult Chilean population with chronic pain.Conclusion The use of CAM in chronic pain patients is higher than the general population. Most felt that it improved their pain. CAM may have arole in the management of chronic pain in particular herbaltherapies. P14 Therapeutic sensations show high similarity between different body-oriented therapiesFlorian BeissnerSomatosensory and Autonomic Therapy Research, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, 30625, Germany BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl sensations that patients experience during thera- peutic interventions are a common phenomenon in many body-oriented therapies. Despite the striking similarity of sensations acrossdifferent therapy systems, no attempt has been made so far to understand their characteristics and clinical relevance from a per- spective that transcends the borders between these systems.MethodsWe searched the pubmed database for the terms therapeutic sensa- tion, deqi, needling sensation, enhanced touch sensation, acupunc- ture sensation, propagated sensation, and alternative spellingsthereof. We identified 311 studies of which we included those thatreported verbal descriptors together with their relative frequencies, i.e. information on how often each descriptor had been used by sub- jects to describe their TS. To reflect both within- and between-studyvariance we first calculated relative frequencies for each of the de-scriptors used in the single studies. We then multiplied these fre- quencies by the weighting factor n/27, where n was the number ofstudies reporting the descriptor at least once. The results were trans-formed into a word cloud. ResultsOur final sample consisted of 27 studies which comprised differentacupuncture modalities (manual, electric, auricular, laser), tactile stimulation, focused ultrasound as well as various sham or placebo interventions. We found that the terms which are most frequentlyused to describes therapeutic sensations across various fields werenumbness (37.6), tingling (36.4), and soreness (31.4), followed by heaviness (24.0), dull pain (23.4), aching (22.1), fullness (21.1), sharp pain (18.6), pressure (15.1), distention (13.7), warmth (13.3), throbbing(10.6) and spreading (7.4), where the numbers in brackets denote theproduct of mean and weighting factor. Conclusions Sensations experienced during therapeutic interventions are highlysimilar in their qualitative nature across different modes of stimula-tion and therapies. Since no generally accepted scientific term exists for this phenomenon, we propose the term therapeutic sensations (TS) for it. TS may be a thread linking seemingly unrelated therapysystems and even explain some pre-scientific concepts, like the me-ridians of Chinese medicine or the idea of some form of energy ex- change between practitioner and patient. P15 Acupuncture-enhanced psychotherapy for painful endometriosis:the role of anxiety and hippocampusFlorian and Fertility Disorders, Heidelberg UniversityWomen 's Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany;5Institute of Medical Psychology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany Correspondence: is a gynecological disorder affecting 6-10% of all women in their reproductive age. Previous studies have shown an as-sociation between pelvic pain and trauma. We wanted to know if pa-tients with painful endometriosis may benefit from a treatment combining psychotherapy for trauma release with acupuncture and related techniques.Methods67 patients with severe painful endometriosis (maximum pain: 7.6 \u00b1 2.0, average pain: 4.5 \u00b1 2.0 on a 10-point numeric rating scale) were included in the study. Resting-state functional magnetic resonanceimaging was used to assess brain connectivity of these patients atbaseline, after three months of therapy and after six months. The analysis was focused on the hippocampus. ResultsWe identified a cortical network comprising of the right anterolateralhippocampus -a region modulating viscerosensory and regions. Regression analysis showed that reduction inconnectivity of this network predicted therapy-induced improvementin patients' anxiety in the treatment group, but not in the control group. After six months, when controls had received delayed inter- vention, both groups showed this association.ConclusionsPatients with a history of endometriosis, who suffer from pelvic pain, can obtain substantial benefit from acupuncture-enhanced psycho- therapy. We have identified a putative mechanism underlying thispotent combination of therapies in treating symptoms of endometri-osis. Our results emphasize the importance of trauma as a central factor in the etiology of pelvic pain and endometriosis.BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 54 of 165P16 DNA targeted therapy for prostate, ovarian and pancreatic cancers Sylvie BeljanskiThe Beljanski Foundation, New York, NY 10017, and Alternative Medicine 2017, P16 PurposeResearch M. Beljanski and D. Malins, has demonstrated that vir-tually all cancers are associated with physical damage to cellular DNA caused by the binding of carcinogens in our environment. This damage involves destabilization of the DNA double helix (breakageof the hydrogen bonds that hold the two strands together) and dis-order in the chemical integrity of the DNA building blocks (breakage of covalent bonds). Despite being well established scientifically, DNA damage associatedwith destabilization and disorder is not widely appreciated. This is re-markable because these physical changes are found in virtually all types of cancer from all individuals. Destabilization and disorder ap- pear to be the underlying causes of cancer that precede mutationsand indeed enable the accumulation of mutations. This is a powerfulcontribution to our understanding of carcinogenesis, but Beljanski went a step further. He identified compounds in plant extracts that specifically target destabilized DNA and prevent proliferation of can-cer cells by disrupting of tumor growth in vivo. Results The extracts are active against prostate, ovarian and pancreatic can-cers in vitro and in vivo. They are effective alone and are synergisticwith chemotherapy drugs, providing a dose reduction effect. The ex- tracts do not induce negative side effects of their own. ConclusionsThe discovery of DNA destabilization is presented and the activity ofthe extracts against three cancers is described. P17 Music listening to reduce anxiety among older adults in the emergency departmentLaura Belland 1, Laura Rivera-Reyes2, Ula Hwang2 1Family Medicine, NewYork-Presbyterian, New York, NY 10032, United States;2Emergency Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United StatesCorrespondence: Laura Belland BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): P17 BackgroundA visit to the emergency department (ED) may be distressing andanxiety-provoking for older adults (age 65). The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the effect of music listening on anxiety levels in older adults in the ED.MethodsThis was a pilot study at the Mount Sinai Hospital during April and May 2015. Inclusion criteria were English-speaking adults 65 who were not deaf. Subjects were randomly assigned to standard care(control) or standard care with 30-60 minutes of music listening thatcommenced immediately after enrollment. Intervention subjects were provided headphones and an iPad with pre-downloaded music (choice of classical, jazz, new age, Chinese traditional, or Latin guitar).Anxiety levels were measured by the Spielberger State Trait AnxietyInventory (STAI) which was conducted at enrollment and after one hour. ResultsA total of 317 patients were screened during study hours; of thesepatients, a total of 35 (11%) were enrolled. When comparing control (n = 16) vs. intervention subjects (n = 16), there were no significant differences in initial STAI scores (43.0 \u00b1 15.0 vs 40.3 \u00b1 12.8, p = 0.57).However, when comparing scores one hour after enrollment, the mean reduction in STAI scores of the intervention subjects was sig- nificantly greater than those of the control subjects (-10.0 \u00b1 12.29 vs-1.88 \u00b1 7.97, p = 0.034).Conclusions These pilot results suggest that music listening may be an effective, non-invasive tool for reducing anxiety among older adults in the ED. P18 Is an anthroposophic curriculum for children with Type 1 Diabetesmellitus (T1DM) different 1): P18 AimDevelopment of the curriculum as first part of a complex evaluationof an anthroposophic education programme for children between 6and 12 years with T1DM. Background T1DM is the most common metabolic disease in childhood. Patientshave to substitute insulin by daily injections or insulin-pump. Thestandard of diabetes treatment includes educational programmes to enable patients to self-manage their insulin-substitution. However, these programmes are focused on blood-sugar management only,and therefore might miss the developmental needs of the children(f.e. growing independency from parents). The anthroposophic edu- cational programme of Herdecke (HeKiDi) focus on these needs of children to enable them to manage their T1DM. The trainingprogramme at the Community-Hospital Herdecke has been approvedby the German Diabetes Association as a therapy and training facility for stage 2 pediatrics and treats 400 children in various school for- mats per year [1]. To compare this programme to others, anthroposo-phicaspects of curriculum have to be described.Methods Hospitations, interviews with most people responsible for the programme and content analysis of interviews and teaching mate-rials to identify intended learning aims, contents and methods of thecurriculum, following the guidelines of TiDieR [2]. Definition of main learning aims and finalisation of the curriculum with the person re- sponsible for the programme.ResultsThe curriculum of HeKiDi can be presented. It follows the standard curriculum in Germany [3], but the learning aims for children within HeKiDi differ, they might also learn to: -feel accepted in their personal developmental or diabetes-related needs, consented as an individual treatment aim be-tween doctors, parents and themselves -develop self-efficacy in diabetes-related but although other fields as life-long consciouness-related task -develop their motoric abilities f.e. to foster their will -develop their artistic and communicative abilities to perceiveand express emotions -develop their social competencies f.e. to use the social network as support. The curriculum focus on individualised treatment, through the estab-lishment of adult mentors, suffering on T1DM themselves, serving asrole model, supporting the children in their daily tasks.Conclusion The HeKiDi-Programm differs from standard programmes. How far the HeKiDi programme is better to foster self-efficacy of children hasBMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 55 of 165to be investigated in an interventional study.

This study investigates the relation- ship between non-specific treatment components and low back pain (LBP) outcomes in physiotherapy, osteopathy, andacupuncture.Methods In a major prospective questionnaire-based study, public (NHS) and private-sector practitioners were recruited by UK-wide mail-shots; practitioners then give invitation packs to eligible adult pa-tients. Practitioners and patients complete validated, reliable, questionnaires measuring non-specific treatment components, mediators and outcomes at: baseline (after first consultation fornew episode of LBP), during treatment (2-weeks post-baseline)and outcome (3-months post-baseline). Recruitment is ongoing; rates and preliminary baseline data from the first 15 months were analysed descriptively.Results3% of invited acupuncturists have enrolled (n = 51), 6% of osteopaths (n = 54), 8% of physiotherapists (n = 84). More acupuncturists and os- teopaths have been recruited from private settings; more physiother-apists have been recruited from the NHS. Acupuncturists haverecruited on average 1 patient each, osteopaths 4, and physiothera- pists 2. Patient recruitment rates are higher in NHS than private set- tings. Patients' baseline disability is comparable across therapies(Roland Morris Questionnaire scores: acupuncture M = 10.0, osteop-athy M = 9.4, physiotherapy M = 10.3, p = .23). Baseline disability is higher in NHS patients (M = 10.7) than private patients (M = 9.6, p = .03).ConclusionsRecruiting practitioners has been challenging, particularly acupunc- turists and NHS-based CAM practitioners. This may be because acu- puncturists treat fewer LBP patients than previously and NHScommissioning of these therapies has decreased. Higher patient re-cruitment rates in NHS settings may reflect different patient popula- tions across sectors.P20Exploring change processes in acupuncture for back pain: a qualitative thematic analysisFelicity Bishop 1, Michelle Lucy Yardley1, P20 PurposeTo explore patients' experiences of acupuncture for back pain and identify psychosocial processes that might support clinical changes. MethodsWe conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviewsand thematic analysis. 23 interviewees were purposively sampled from a nationwide longitudinal questionnaire study (n = 485). We de- liberately interviewed men (n = 8) and women (n = 15), of varyingages (29 -82 years), receiving acupuncture in diverse settings (7 acu- puncture clinics; 5 physiotherapy; 9 pain clinic; 1 general practice), with different adherence levels (17 attended all appointments). We also sampled for diversity in outcomes (positive/negative/no changein disability/pain/wellbeing).Results Participants described how, on starting treatment, they were desper- ately hoping that acupuncture would improve their ability to func-tion and enjoy their lives despite back pain, and so they typicallycared little about how it might work. They expressed concerns about acupuncture needles and side-effects, and trusted acupuncturists who made them feel safe, explained the treatment clearly, and madethem feel special and listened to. Participants felt more in controlwhen acupuncturists created space for dialogue and this was import- ant because they perceived little control over pain and conventional treatment options. Some but not all participants experienced bene-fits including: pain relief, better functioning, and feeling happier orless depressed. As a result of their experiences, they described be- lieving that acupuncture can work to produce real, if short-term, benefits.ConclusionsClinical changes in back pain as a result of acupuncture may be sup- ported by therapeutic relationships that empower patients and at- tend to their concerns. P21 Biotechnological approaches for studying the P21 PurposePresent work aimed to understand if distinct bacterial communities could account for the differences in the medicinal properties of twoEchinacea plant species by affecting their physiology and metabolism. Methods Axenic E. purpurea and E. angustifolia plants were infected with E. purpurea endophytes and examined for the presence of bacteria and for different physiological parameters. VAP assays were performed to test bacteria effect on primary root elongation and morphology. DualBMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 1):322 Page 56 of 165cultures experiments between Echinacea cell cultures and different bacteria were established to test the influence on both plant and bacterial cells growth.ResultsEndophytic strains tended to recolonize the host plant native niche, endophytes from stem/leaves increasing the number of leaves, or the plant weight if coming from roots. In vitro morphogenetic behav- iour indicated that the two Echinacea species had a different content of endogenous plant hormones. E. purpurea was able to regenerate new shoots in culture media enriched with high content of cytoki-nins while E. angustifolia produced only clusters of undifferentiated cells (callus). VAP analyses showed effects on plant root elongationand morphology depending on differences in IAA production by dif- ferent bacteria. Dual cultures experiments showed that plant cells promote the growth of endophytes, these latter affecting the plantgrowth itself.Conclusions In vitro colonization of endophytes is divergent according to their na- tive in vivo compartment. Different composition in plant primary me- tabolism in the two Echinacea species affect the plant-bacteria interaction modulating the production of plant metabolites, key com-pounds for colonization strictly related to the Echinacea therapeutic properties. P22 Equipment-based movement therapy in stroke rehabilitationNadine Brands-Guendling, Peter P22 BackgroundStroke is the third leading cause of death in Germany, a leadingcause of disability and a considerable cost factor in the health care system. Despite a variety of specific therapies available, a recovery of impaired motor functions after a stroke is in most instances incom-plete. Hence, complementary therapeutic strategies of neurologicalrehabilitation are needed to improve the recovery of impaired persons. ObjectivesThe aim of this study is to depict the general importance of an elec-trically driven exercise machine for arms and legs for mobility train- ing in the neurological rehabilitation. Methods20 stroke patients randomized into an intervention group (ten sub-jects, arm and leg training) and a control group (ten subjects, physio- therapy gait training), are treated for four weeks, five times a week. In week zero and four, the patients are tested on motor performance,walking ability, physical and mental quality of life, endurance andrough movement skills. Results The test of motor performance with the Rivermead Motor Assess-ment (p = 0.006) and the test of rough movement skills of the armswith the Box and Block Test (p = 0.042) indicate significant main ef- fects. The quality of life, which is measured by the SF-36, points out a significant main effect for the physical health score (p = 0.008). Themeasurement of endurance with the 6-Minute Walk Test (p = 0.000)and the walking ability with the Dynamic Gait Index (p = 0.033) indi- cate significant differences between both groups. No noticeable out- comes appear from the testing of the walking ability with theFunctional Ambulation Categories and the mental health score of theSF-36. Conclusion An equipment-based mobility training seems to be beneficial forstroke patients with hemiparesis. The significance of the test series isto some extent limited due to the small sample size. The positive re- sults, however, might provide thought-provoking impulses for neuro- logical therapies.P23 Spinal manipulation and exercise for adolescent low back pain Gert Bronfort 1, Roni Evans1, Mitch Haas2, of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, United States;2 University of Western States, Portland, OR, United States;3Children's Hospital and Clinics of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United StatesCorrespondence: QuestionLow back pain (LBP) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Whilethere is a growing recognition that LBP in adolescents approximatesthat of adults, there has been very little research to guide therapeutic management. This trial is one of the firstto determine whether spinal manipulative therapy (SMT), a commonly used complementaryhealth approach combined with exercise therapy (ET) compares withET alone, to reduce chronic LBP in the short and long term in adolescents. MethodsWe conducted a controlled pragmatic trial with random allocation byminimization from 2010 to 2013 in two research centers (Minnesota and Oregon, USA). The primary outcome was participant-rated LBP at 12, 26, and 52 weeks. Secondary outcomes included patient-rateddisability, quality of life (PedsQL), medication use, patient and care-giver rated improvement and satisfaction. Objective biomechanical outcomes were collected at baseline, 12, and 26 weeks post enroll- ment by blinded examiners.ResultsParticipantswere 185 adolescents aged 12-18 years with chronic LBP, who received 12 weeks (8-16 sessions) of SMT ET or ET alone.Of the185 enrolled patients, 179 (97%) provided follow-up data at 12 weeksand 174 (94%) at 26 and 52 weeks. For LBP, SMT ET compared to EThad a small advantage of 5 percentage points ([95% CI, 0 to 11], P = 0.08) at the end of treatment (12 weeks). Larger, clinically important advantages of 11 percentage points at 26 weeks ([95% CI, 5 to 17]; P= 0.001) and 8 percentage points at week 52 ([95% CI, 2 to 14], P =0.009) for SMT ET were also observed. At 26 weeks only, SMT ET per- formed better than ET alone in terms of low back disability (P = 0.04) and global improvement (P = 0.02). The SMT ET group also experi-enced significantly greater satisfaction with care than ET alone atweeks 12, 26, and 52 (P 0.02). There were no serious treatment- related adverse events.ConclusionsFor adolescents with chronic LBP, adding spinal manipulation to ex-ercise was more effective than exercise alone in the long-term but not the short-term. P24 Effect of Chinese herbal decoction Qinlingye extract on the PGC-1/RANTES inflammatory metabolic signaling pathway in rats with uric acid-induced renal injury Xiangwei Bu 1, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Rheumatology, Beijing, China;2Community Health Service Center of Yangsong Town, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China;3Jingzhou Central Hospital of Hubei Province, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): P24 the effect of Chinese herbal decoction Qinlingye extra-ct(QLYE) on gene transcription and expression SPF male SD rats (200 \u00b1 10 g) aged 6 weeks were acclimated for1 week, 6 of which were selected randomly as Normal Control Group(NCG).63 rats were fed with yeast feed and adenine gavage to establish UAIRI model. Successful models (n = 60) were randomizedBMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 57 of 165into model, positive drug and high-, medium-, low-dose of QLYE group (n = 12 per group), given gavage administration of distilled water(10 3.73 g.kg-1, 1.87 g.kg-1) everyday. After 6 and 8 weeks, half rats of every group were sacrificed. We used RT-PCR to detect mRNA tran- scription of IL-1 ,PGC-1 ,RANTES in renal tissue, ELISA to measure protein expression of IL-1 and RANTES in serum, Western blot and immunohistochemistry to analyze protein expression of PGC-1 in renal tissue.Results Compared with NCG, the mRNA transcription and protein expressionof PGC-1 in model group were lower at 6th and 8th weeks (P < 0.05, P < 0.01),while RANTES and IL-1 were higher (P < 0.05, P < 0.01).Compared with model group, protein expression of PGC-1 in 3 QLYE groups was higher(P < 0.01), protein expression of RANTES inmedium-,low-dose groups was lower(P < 0.05),and mRNA transcrip-tion and expression of IL-1 in 3 QLYE groups were lower(P < 0.05,P < 0.01) at the 6th week. At the 8th week, mRNA transcriptionand protein expression of PGC-1 were higher (P < 0.05,P < 0.01), whereas those of RANTES were lower(P < 0.05,P < 0.01) in 3 QLYEgroups,and protein expression of IL-1 in high-, medium-dose groups was < 0.05,P < 0.01).ConclusionThe mechanism of ameliorating UAIRI may be related to regula-tion of PGC-1 signaling pathway and inhibition of inflammatory metabolic injury. P25 Sense of coherence and perception of the transcendent ascontributors of Catholic priests 'life Eckhard Witten/Herdecke University, Herdecke, 58313, Germany;2Faculty of Theology, Caritas Science and Christian Social Work, Albert-Ludwig University, Freiburg, Germany;3 Department of Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Paderborn, Paderborn, Antonovsky\"s salutogenetic model has become one of the most important conceptual frameworks in health sciences in recent decades. Less is known about Catholic priests who 's global life orien- tation is their religious faith. We thus intended to analyze the influ-ence of SOC, transcendence perception as a measure of (affective) spirituality, spiritual dryness as a phase of a spiritual crisis on their life satisfaction, and social support.MethodsThis study is part of the German Pastoral Ministry Study, an anonym- ous survey among Catholic priests from 22 out of 27 German dio- ceses using standardized questionnaires (i.e., SOC-13, DSES-6, SDS,FSozU, SWLS). For this analysis we relied on data of 4,157 priests witha predominantly age range from 45 to 85 years, and performed first correlation analyses and then regression analyses to define which of these variables may predict their life satisfaction.ResultsThe SOC correlated positively with life satisfaction (SWLS, r = .49), transcendence perception (DSES, r = .33), and social support (FSozU, r = .30), and negatively with spiritual dryness (SDS, r = -.49). SOC ex-plains only 14% of DSES 14% of SOC 's variance. Stepwise regression analyses indicated that priests 'life satisfaction was predicted best by SOC (Beta = .37, T = 23.1, p < .0001) explaining28% of variance. Transcendence perception (Beta = .29, T = 17.9, p < .0001) would add further 9% of explained variance, while social support (Beta = .09; T = 6.6; p < .0001) and spiritual dryness (Beta= -.04, T = -2.4, p = .018) would add both < 1% of further variance ex-planation, and are thus of minor relevance. Conclusions For Catholic priests having a meaningful life and perceiving the sa-cred in their life are relevant sources contributing to their life satis-faction, while social support was of minor relevance. P26 Validation of the Affected Body Image questionnaire in people with limb amputations -not satisfaction with themselves and their appearance was of relevance but dissatisfaction with livingcircumstances Arndt B\u00fcssing 1, Ralph-Achim P26 PurposeHaving an amputated limb represents a relevant turning point in life. For individuals the amputation is interference in the personal phys-ical and psychological integrity. Body image changes are an import-ant consequence to be considered with regard to the adjustment process and rehabilitation after a limp amputation. This paper pre- sents the findings of the validation of the Affected Body Image (ABI)questionnaire in a sample of older patients with amputated limbswith and without phantom pain. Methods Cross-sectional, anonymous survey among 112 individuals with anamputated limb using standardized questionnaires (i.e., GCPS, HADS,SF-12, BMLSS, etc.). Results The mean age of the sample (66% men) is 63 \u00b1 10 years; phantompain is present on 58% of the cases. Exploratory factor analysis of the14 item ABI questionnaire indicated four sub-constructs explaining 65% of the total variance in the data, i.e., Distance to own body; (intention to) Change own body; (perception of being) Avoided by others; Dislike own body. The internal reliability of the instrument is good (Cronbach 's alpha = 0.86). The ABI scores correlated strongly with depressive states (Escape from illness/affection, dissatisfaction with living situation, depressive symptoms), and moderately with dis-ability scores and low mental quality of life and life satisfaction. Es-cape and dissatisfaction with living situation were the best predictors of patients 'ABI scores, explaining 51% of variance. Interestingly, it was not patients 'satisfaction with themselves and their appearance, or whether they mind the look of their body at all, which showed significant differences for the ABI perceptions, but their dissatisfac- tion with their living circumstances. The prevalence of phantom pain had no relevant influence on ABI scores. While most amputees en-rolled in this study did not perceive relevant ABI, Distance from the own body was perceived with high scores by 9%, while the intention toChange their body was scored high by 24%. Conclusions The 14-item instrument is a practical instrument with good internalconsistency and plausible associations with external measures. It measures how individuals feel about their changed body image and how they deal with the situation after an amputation. The scale mayhave an important strength to address more closely the attitude andthe living conditions of amputees and their complex adjustment process following an amputation.BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 58 of 165P27 Randomized clinical trial to treat patients with chronic back pain: a comparison of the efficacy of Yoga, Eurythmy Coping, Witten/Herdecke University, Herdecke, 58313, Germany;2Research Methodology and Statistics Integrative Berlin, Germany;5Internal Medicine, Havelh\u00f6he Hospital, Berlin, Germany;6Clinical Naturopathy, Institute for Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economy, Charit\u00e9 -University Medicine, Berlin, 10117, Germany;7Internal and Complementary Medicine, Immanuel Hospital Berlin, Berlin, Germany Correspondence: Arndt B\u00fcssing PurposeTo treat patients with chronic low back pain, multimodal approaches are seen as essential. While particularly physical training is increas-ingly recommended, there are several other important interventionswhich might be effective, too. We thus aimed to compare the effect- iveness of yoga, eurythmy RCT we treated patients with chronic low back pain for 8 weeks in group sessions (90 minutes once per week), with a further 8 week follow-up phase. Additionally,15 min. daily home exercises were recommended. Primary out-come was patients 'physical disability (RMDS); secondary outcome variables were pain intensity, health-related quality of life (SF-12),life satisfaction (BMLSS), positive mood (ASTS), stress perception(PSS), depression (CES-D), Self-Regulation (SR), mindfulness (FMI),Inner Coherence (ICS), and Inner Correspondence and Peaceful Harmony (ICPH). ResultsAfter multiple imputations of missing data, data of 270 patients wereused for statistical analyses (Yoga, n = 96; EuT, n = 88; PhyE, n = 86). There were no significant baseline differences. In all groups, RMDS and pain intensity scores decreased significantly within the 16 weeks,while quality of life increased. There were no significant differencesbetween the three groups for the pain variables, while for SF-12 's mental health component EuT had a significant benefit compared toPhyE (\u00df = 4.6, p = 0.008). Within the groups, we see significant im-provements of BMLSS, PSS, CES-D, ICS and EuT, but not for PhyE, while there were no significant im- provements for FMI and SR. ConclusionsCompared to the 'gold standard 'PhyE, the two rather \"meditative\" in- terventions EuT and yoga were similar effective to reduce pain- associated affections. However, there was a significant benefit for EuT to improve SF-12's mental health component compared to yogaand PhyT. P28 Influence of lifestyle on hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia based on Korea Community Health Survey Chunhoo Cheon, Bo H Jang, Seong G Ko, Ching W Huang, Yui Sasaki,Youme KoKyung University, Seoul, 02447, South days, non-communicable diseases tention. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia which areknown to be closely related to lifestyle were defined lifestyle relateddisease. The present study was designed to investigate the influence of lifestyle on hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. MethodsEach determinants of lifestyle related disease include following riskfactors. Lifestyle determinants: alcohol consumption, smoking, phys- ical activities, dietary patterns. Sociodemographic determinants: age, sex, residential area, household income, education. Psychological de-terminants: subjective perception of stress. Comorbidity determi-nants: obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia. The associations between diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and lifestyle factors were analyzed using simple andmultiple logistic regression analysis.Results More than 4 hours of sedentary time, eating food bland showed sig- nificant association with hypertension. Smoking and more than9 hours of sleep showed significant association with diabetes. Dyslip-idemia was significantly associated with more than 4 hours of seden- tary time. High risk drinking showed positive correlation with hypertension and negative correlation with diabetes. Pack years ofsmoking had negative correlation with hypertension. Breakfast skip-ping showed negative correlation with hypertension and diabetes, and positive correlation with dyslipidemia in 16-44 years. More than 4 hours of sedentary time were positively correlated with hyperten-sion, diabetes, and dyslipidemia.Conclusions Lifestyle has considerable influence on hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia, and these are also risk factors for other disease. There-fore, it is important to manage lifestyle for preventing lifestyle dis-ease. Further studies will be required to clearly define the causal relationship between lifestyle and diseases.

AimTo explore GPs experiences of workplace challenges and stressesand their coping strategies, particularly focusing on understanding the impact of NHS workplace change. Design Study design was qualitative, with data collected from two focus groups and seven one-to-one telephone interviews.Method Focus groups (n = 15) and interviews (n = 7) explored the experiences of currently practicing GPs in England, recruited through conveni-ence sampling. Data were collected using a semi-structured interviewapproach and analysed using thematic analysis. Results Interviewees understood GPs to be under intense and historically un-precedented pressures, which were tied to the contexts in whichthey work; with important moral implications for good doctoring. Many reported that being a full-time GP was too stressful: work- related stress led to mood change, sleep disruption, increases in anx-iety and tensions with loved ones. Some had subsequently soughtways to downsize their clinical workload. Workplace change resulted in little time for the things that helped GP resilience: a good work life balance and better contact with colleagues. Whilst some GPs werecoping better than others, GPs acknowledged that there was only soBMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 59 of 165much an individual GP could do to manage their stress, given the ex- ternal work issues they faced. ConclusionGPs grasp their emotional lives and stresses as being meaningfullyshaped by NHS factors; resilience building should move beyond the individual to include systemic work issues. P30 Use of complementary and alternative medicine during anoutbreak of MERS among community peopleHyun J Cho, Dongwoon Han, Soo J Choi, Young S Jung, Hyea B Im Global Health and Development, Hanyang University, College of Medicine, Seoul, 133-791, South KoreaCorrespondence: Hyun J Cho BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): P30 PurposeTo obtain information on the use of complementary and alternativemedicine (CAM) among community people during MERS outbreak in Korea. MethodsTo collect data, we conduct a cross sectional study using semi-structured questionnaire during 26th November to 2nd December 2015. The sample size of participants was 331(response rate 82.75%). Respondents were asked questions about their use of CAM in thepast 12 months, perception on CAM and outbreak, reasons for theuse of CAM and so on, as well as general socio-demographics Results During the 2015 MERS outbreak, the percentage of participants whohad used at least one CAM therapy was 76.1%. The most popularCAM used was vitamins (51.6%). The most common reason partici- pant gave for using CAM was to \"stimulate an immune response\" (63.1%). The higher level of concern on no available treatmentmethod for MERS was associated with greater use of CAM, that isstatically significant. The predictors on the use of CAM were: gender, age, perception on government policy on MERS outbreak, subjective health status.ConclusionsCAM was popular among community people during 2015 MERS out- break in Korea. The results of this study show that community people currently lack the knowledge, confidence, and information to provideproper guidance to the increasing number of people being usingCAM modalities. Central and local government, academia, healthcare professionals should responsibly advise community people and pa- tients about the use of CAM. And further studies are required to im-portant sources of guidance with respect to providing communitypeople and patient counseling. P31 Attitudes and knowledge towards interprofessionalism amongnaturopathic students Kieran Cooley 1,2, Laura Tummon-Simmons1 1Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine, Department of research and clinical epidemiology, Toronto, Canada;2University of Technology Sydney, ARCCIM, Faculty of Health, Sydney, AustraliaCorrespondence: Kieran Cooley Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): P31 BackgroundAttitudes among health care practitioners have been shown to im- pact their effectiveness in collaborative practice. Naturopaths havescope and interest in collaboration, however there is a lack of quanti-tative evidence evaluating their attitudes towards interprofessional collaboration (IPC). Understanding these attitudes and those of co- operating practitioners may assist in future integrative practice.MethodsAll Naturopathic Interns (NIs) from the Canadian College of Naturo- pathic Medicine (n = 131) were surveyed using the validated Atti- tudes to Health Professionals Questionnaire (AHPQ) followinginformed consent. Responses were anonymous, scales were scored in duplicate to enhance accuracy. Demographic information (age, gen- der, self-rated experience in interprofessional settings), and know-ledge and attitudes towards nine healthcare professions (medicaldoctors, nurses/nurse practitioners, pharmacists, naturopathic doc- tors/interns, chiropractors, registered massage therapists, physiother- apists, traditional Chinese medical practitioners, registered dieticians)were assessed. Results were summarized as 2 aggregate subscales,\"caring\" and \"subservient\". Two-tailed students t test, and linear re- gression tests were to used to assess differences across healthcare professionals and examine correlations.Results88 responses (67.2% response rate) were collected from initial gen- eral survey of NIs with 58 of these responses being completed effect- ively. The majority of participants were female (87.9%), with less than1 year of experience as a part of a regulated health care profession(75.9%); 29.6% indicated they had 0 or no expertise in integrative health care models (29.6%) .By NIs, NDs were seen as the most \"car- ing.\"; a statistically significant difference compared to NI\"s views of other professions (p < 0.05). R.Phs and MDs were rated lowest on the\"caring\" subscale in comparison to other professions. NDs, RN/NPs, RMTs, TCMs, and RDs were found to have non-statistically significant, but higher \"subservience\" attributed to their professions while. MDs,DCs, and PTs were rated lowest in terms of \"subservience\" in com-parison to other professions (p < 0.05). Conclusion It is feasible to assess knowledge and attitudes of NIs. NIs view them-selves differently than other health care professionals. Further under-standing of NDs attitudes towards interprofessional collaboration would inform educational competencies, professional development and IPC.

Evidence-based interventions implemented within hospitals are needed to promote employees well-being. Mindfulness-Based Cogni-tive Therapy (MBCT) is an 8-week evidence-based group interventionfor reducing stress and improving well-being. No research has ex- plored the use of an abbreviated MBCT protocol specifically for hos- pital employees that would be feasible and practical.

Participants completed self-report measures of stress and burnout pre and post intervention, and answered open- ended satisfaction questions post-intervention. Four rounds of the 4-week group were completed, each one enrolling at least 10 partici-pants, but with attendance rates declining across sessions (60% at session 2 vs. 49% at session 4) due to work-related schedule conflicts. Intervention content was acceptable as evidenced by high perceivedvalue ( M= 9.18 out of 10), homework compliance atBMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 60 of 165least 3 times/week), and unanimous requests for the intervention to expand. There were large, statistically significant decreases in stress (M= 2.1, p< .001, d= 1.23) and burnout ( M= .46, p= .01, d= .62), which were supported by qualitative themes of improved self-regulation, mindfulness, stress reduction, and work productivity. Conclusions It is feasible to implement an abbreviated MBCT intervention for hos-pital employees within busy hospital settings. This intervention isboth acceptable and useful for improving employees health-related outcomes.

The scale ranges from1 (completely good) to 7 (completely bad) with a neutral point. Stu-dents also fill out a detailed patient history form at their first session. Students without the history form were excluded from analysis. Sur- vey values were normalized to values between 0 and 1. A repeatedmeasures mixed effect model was created for analysis.Results There were 200 eligible students (n = 200) with ages ranging from 14-80 years and a mean age of 45.9 \u00b1 15.0 years. Participants were77% (n = 154) female and 22.5% (n = 45) male. The top five chiefcomplaints include low back pain (n = 40, 19.0%), hips (n = 18, 9.0%), menstrual problems (n = 16, 8.00%), cancer (n = 14, 7.00%), and neck pain (n = 12, 6.0%). The median number of classes attended is 9. Themedian ratio of length of practice to the number of classes attendedis 9.33 days per class.

Methods A controlled repeated-measures single-blind trial was conducted in37 volunteer caregivers 24.3% male and 75.7% female with a mean(SD) age of 44.03 (7.30) years. The inclusion criteria were: parents car- ing for sick children with a caregiver burden of more than 55 points in Zarit Burden Scale and live with the child in the same home for atleast 2 years before the study. They were recruited from associationsin Granada city and its province and through word and mouth. Heart rate variability, blood pressure and resting heart rate were assessed as outcomes and were measured before and after the pro-gram (0,1 month).Results We found no significant between-group differences in descriptive characteristics or in any pre-intervention outcome measure. A re-peated measured analysis revealed significant increases in HRV Index(F = 8.4, p = 0.006), SDNN (F = 13.59, p = 0.001), RMSSD (F = 10.72, p = 0.002) and significant decreases in systolic blood pressure (F = 16.23, p = 0.000), diastolic blood pressure (F = 34.39, p = 0.000) and in restheart rate (F = 17.90, p = 0.000) in experimental group in comparisonto the control group. Conclusions A Reiki training program improves the cardiac balance in high bur-den caregivers across enhancing heart rate variability and diminish-ing blood pressure.

P36 Retrospective study on the use of homeopathy in a public primary care settingGualberto Diaz-Saez Madrid, Spain;4MD Anderson, Homeopathy, Gandhi, ObjectivesDescribe the frequency of use of homeopathic treatments in a publicprimary care outpatient clinic, the diseases treated and the clinicaloutcome. Methods A retrospective observational study of the patients of a general prac-tice unit was performed. 142 medical records were randomly se-lected. The variables were: use of homeopathy, diagnosis; kind of illness (acute or chronic), prescribed treatment, role of homeopathy and clinical outcome.Results63,4% of the patients had used homeopathy at least once, which was independent form gender and age. Of them, 55,6% were treated for chronic conditions. Homeopathy was the only prescription in46,7% of cases (main in 89% and adjuvant in 44,4%). Most frequentlytreated complaints were and cutaneous (67%). The clinical was favourable (improved or cured) in 578% ofcases, 60% of the acute and 56% of the chronic. No adverse reac-tions were recorded. Conclusions Homeopathy can be a useful therapeutical option in a public primarycare setting. The study points out the feasibility of its implantationand the effectiveness and safety of the homeopathic Primary care; Pharmacoepidemiology; Retro- promoting the use of integrative medicine in themedically-underserved and uninsured community of Anaheim through crescent clinic of Orange County Demijon DicenUniversity of California, Irvine, Huntington Beach, 92647, CA, and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): P37 BackgroundWhile it is evident that the use of Integrative Medicine (IM) amongst Americans has increased, there has been a clear separation of those who can and cannot gain access to integrative health. Since therehas been limited knowledge of IM-use in minorities, more researchon patient attitudes of IM, including nutritional and lifestyle medi- cine, is critical to explore its role amongst the underserved community.PurposeThe goal of this study is to understand the position of integrative medicine (IM) in the low income and underserved population of Ana- heim and how IM can be incorporated into the quality improvementof outpatient primary health care amongst minorities.Methods A survey was administered for eight weeks to patients at Crescent Clinic, a non-profit, free clinic for the uninsured located in Anaheim.The 14-question survey assessed patient attitudes and knowledge ofIM, interest of IM health fairs and workshops, and the overall role of IM in health care in terms of disease prevention and treatment. The data was stored in Microsoft Excel and analyzed with RedCAP.ResultsOf the 48 Crescent Clinic patients surveyed, 72.0% of patients had lit- tle to no knowledge about IM, but 95.8% of patients would consider IM if his or her physician recommended it. Additionally, 92.0% of thepatients were willing to learn more about IM if there were accessibleworkshops in the community. While 89.5% of Crescent Clinic patients believed that IM should be a treatment option, 97.0% of the patients believed IM can be used as preventative medicine.ConclusionOverall, the study greatly supports the role of IM amongst the unin- sured and underserved community of Anaheim through more educa- tion and intervention. There is also a high demand in IM preventionand treatment from healthcare providers. This may suggest imple-menting intervention programs on nutritional medicine and lifestyle medicine to improve wellness and manage blood pressure amongst Crescent Clinic patients, which can be made available to all under-served and uninsured patients of Anaheim, CA. P38 Measuring complementary medicine in Australian conventional healthcare education 1,2, Jon Adams2, Amie Steel1,2, Jon Wardle2 1Office Endeavour College of Natural Health, Fortitude Valley, 4006, Australia;2Australian Research Centre in Complementary and Integrative Health of Technology Sydney (UTS),Sydney, P38 BackgroundComplementary medicine (CM) is being accessed at a high rate indeveloping countries. Little is understood about how much conven- tional medicine practitioner learn about CM, so this study aimed to develop a quantitative tool to enable the CM content in Australianconventional healthcare courses to be mapped.Methods A questionnaire was developed to investigate the level of inclusion in CM content in CHC and the attitudes and beliefs of the faculty re-sponsible for determining curriculum CM content in the form of theCurriculum in Integrative Medicine Questionnaire (CIMQ). This includ- ing consideration of cognitive and communicative processing and was then pre-tested through cognitive and linguistic interviewingwith a convenience sample of conventional healthcare course con-tent decision makers (n = 5). The pre-validated tools CAM Health Be- lief Questionnaire (CHBQ) and Integrative Medicine Attitude Questionnaire (IMAQ) were included in the attitudes and perceptionsconstruct of the CIMQ.Results Non-standardised incorporation of CM inclusion in nursing and mid- wifery courses meant the general course characteristics construct re-quired significant refinement to allow for variability in CM inclusion.CM content delivery in courses was another CIMQ construct that had to reflect this flexibility in CM presence within conventional health- care higher education.ConclusionsVariability of CM inclusion means measuring CM presence in discrete health professionals education courses is difficult so knowing what exposure to complementary healthcare exists isvery problematic. The CIMQ is the first step forward in under-standing the level of familiarity conventional healthcare has of CM and furthering the possibility of interprofessional communica- tion and eventually collaboration.BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 62 of 165P39 Providing maternity care in a silo: experiences of Complementary Medicine practitioners in AustraliaHelene Diezel1,2, Adams2 1Office of Research, Endeavour College of Natural Health, Fortitude Valley, 4006, Australia;2Australian Research Centre in Complementary and Integrative Health (ARCCIM), University of Technology Sydney (UTS),Sydney, Australia;3Sociology, University of New South Wales, Sydney, AustraliaCorrespondence: P39 BackgroundWomen 's use of Complementary Medicine (CM) during pregnancy is reported as high in developed countries but little is known about theexperiences of providers of this care and how this care is occurring in contemporary healthcare.CM practitioners are involved in mater- nity care at an increasing rate where patient centred care and inter-professional collaboration are paramount to ensure the effective andsafe health provision for mothers and babies. Despite this, comple- mentary healthcare providers are not currently included in the main- stream category of services providing maternity care in mostdeveloped countries. The study presents the perspectives and experi-ences of CM practitioners providing care to pregnant and birthing women from outside of the established maternity care system. MethodsSemi-structured interviews were conducted using an interview guide,which had been piloted with a CM practitioner known to the re- searcher. Thematic data analysis was undertaken from the interview transcripts after importing into NVIVO qualitative data analysisprogram.Results Practitioners from a variety of CM disciplines were interviewed (n = 23) and a semi-structured approach was employed. Fieldwork wasalso designed to remain sensitive to participants\" own telling andconcerns. Themes emerged around professional practice of CM prac- titioners falling outside of the maternity \"system\" and how this was reported to negatively impact CM practitioner 's experiences of work- ing with other maternity care providers.Conclusions CM practitioners experiences of appear to experience a lack of inter- professional collaboration when providing maternity care to womenand do not feel supported by mainstream healthcare systems in theirprovision of maternity services. P40 Exploring diet-related factors associated with gastrointestinal heat retention syndrome in children: a cross-sectional studyFei Dong, He Yu, Tiegang Liu, Xueyan Ma, Liyi Yan, Yuxiang Wan, ZianZheng, Xiaohong Gu Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 100029, China Correspondence: He Yu (yuhe221@126.com) 1): heat retention syndrome (GHRS) is a syndrome thatis associated with increased gastrointestinal heat caused by a meta-bolic block in energy. This study aim to explore the diet-related fac- tors which may be associated with GHRS. MethodsA cross-sectional study has been conducted in pediatric clinic depart-ment of Beijing Dongfang Hospital from October 2014 to Januar- y2016.Children who were eligible for inclusion criterion in our studywere those with age 1 year old and 18 years old and with a his- tory of 3 or more RTI episodes in the past 12 months. TCM symp- toms, demographic and physiological characteristics were recordedby using semi-structured questionnaire. Participants were enrolledinto group with GHRS and group without GHRS according to whether they had GHRS or not. Logistic regression model was used to screen diet-related independent variables.Results275 (50.46%) children with GHRS and 270 (49.54%) without GHRS were enrolled and finished questionnaire survey.

Vegetables eatingquantity, fruit eating frequency, bean curd eating frequency werenegatively correlated with GHRS. P41 Exploring association between gastrointestinal heat retention syndrome and pneumonia in children: a prospective cohort studyFei Dong, He Yu, Liqun Wu, Tiegang Liu, Xueyan Ma, Jiaju Ma, Liyi Yan,Yuxiang Wan, Zian Zheng, Jianhua Zhen, Xiaohong Gu Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 100029, China Correspondence: Xiaohong Gu the retentionsyndrome (GHRS) and pneumonia in children.Methods A prospective cohort study has been conducted in pediatric clinic department of Beijing Dongfang Hospital from October to Decemberin 2014.TCM symptoms, demographic and physiological characteris-tics were recorded by using semi-structured questionnaire. GHRS was considered as a predisposing factor. Children participants were followed up for next 12 months. We contacted with their parents byusing a face-to-face questionnaire interview, via email or phoneevery 6 months. Episodes of pneumonia and RTIs were recorded in detail. Results420 children were enrolled and 370(88.10%) followed up for12 months. The incidence of RTI was 5.37 (5.14-5.60)episodes per child-year. The risk ratio (RR) value of pneumonia occurrence in 6 months follow-up visit was 1.58 (0.94-2.65), RR value of pneumoniaoccurrence in 12 months follow-up visit was 1.54(0.91-2.59). Swift di-gestion with increased appetite (P = 0.069), excess head sweating (P = 0.006), foul breath (P = 0.085), and fingerprint red or purple (P = 0.021) were positively correlated with pneumonia occurrence in12 months follow-up visit in linear regression model. Severe swift di-gestion with increased appetite OR = 15.69(1.21-203.46), severe foul breath OR = 1.76(0.97-3.22), mild dry stool OR = 1.94(1.01-3.71), andBMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1):322 Page 63 of 165fingerprint red or/and purple OR = 7.48(1.23, 45.66) were positively correlated with pneumonia occurrence in 12 months follow-up visit in logistic regression model.ConclusionsGHRS is a risk factor of pneumonia in children and may be associated with pneumonia. Swift digestion with increased appetite, excess head sweating, foul breath, yellow urine, dry stool, purple fingerprintwere positively associated with pneumonia.Chinese Clinical Trial Registry Number: ChiCTR-CCH-13003770 P42 Patients, medical staff and complementary therapists' integrative medicine: a systematic reviewJulie Dubois, Pierre-Yves RodondiInstitute of Social and Preventive Medicine, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, 1010, Switzerland Correspondence: Julie Dubois BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2017, 17(Suppl 1): P42 PurposeAttempts to integrate complementary and alternative medicine(CAM) treatments into conventional care are being made throughoutthe world. The objective was to investigate patients, medical staff and complementary therapists 'position towards the inclusion of CAM into conventional care and the forms it should take. MethodA database search was conducted in EMBASE, Medline, Pubmed and Web of Science for the period 2000-2016. Research articles were in- cluded if they specifically addressed perspectives of users and profes-sionals in western countries towards the integration of CAM intoconventional care and the modalities of that integration. Results On a total of 644 identified papers 15 met the inclusion criteria. Tenarticles used questionnaire surveys, 4 used qualitative methods and1 used a mixed-method approach. Ten studies were conducted in Israel (by the same research team), 2 in the USA, 2 in Europe and 1 in Australia. Those studies revealed a tendency to support theprinciple of CAM integration but discrepancies on the forms it shouldtake. Family physicians were often considered as the best source for referral, but views diverged on whom should provide treatments (MD vs non-MD CAM practitioners) and where (primary care clinics/hospitals vs distinct location). Patients constituted the mosthomogenous group in their conceptions of integrative medicine. Conclusion This review showed that, with the exception of the Israeli ones, few stud- ies have addressed the subject under scope. More investigations are needed among the various actors involved to delineate how integrative medicine should be implemented to fit local contexts and needs.P43 Movements of Medi- cine, has an impact on cardiac autonomic regulation as assessed e.g. by the analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). EYT consists of a repetition of a pre-defined movement sequence in conjunction with guided and motorimagery. In this study, the impact of the movement sequence and its repe-tition during an EYT exercise on cardiovascular regulation is investigated. Methods Twenty-eight healthy subjects (age: 27.1 \u00b1 5.9 year, 20 female) performedan EYT exercise guided by an EYT therapist. The therapist controlled thespeed of the EYT exercise by means of a repeatedly shown video record- ing of the movement sequence. Control exercise 1 (CE1) consisted of the exercise movements without guided imagery, control exercise 2 (CE2)was walking on the spot. Exercise movements were video recorded formovement analysis. Coherence between exercise movements and oscilla- tions of HRV (extracted from Holter ecg recordings) were analyzed. ResultsThe coherence between exercise movements and oscillations of HRVwere pronounced during the EYT exercise (0.96) and CE1 (0.98). CE2 showed a lower level of coherence (0.47). The duration of a single movement sequence was 30 seconds, i.e. 0.033 Hz repetition fre-quency, leading to an increase of very low frequency power of HRVcompared to CE2 (9.60 and CE1 led to oscilla-tions of cardiac autonomic regulation similar to the repetition frequencyof the exercise. Hence, EYT induces cardio-locomotor coherence.
