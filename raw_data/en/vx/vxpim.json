The 1992 edition of the 'Green Book' coincided with theintroduction Haemophilus influenzae meningitis, epiglottis and other serious infections from this organism have now virtually disappeared from paediatric wards. In 1992, the changing age distribution of measles was noted and some modification in immunisation strategy anticipated. Mass measles-rubellaimmunisation to prevent an epidemic of measles in school-age children wasconducted during November 1994. The Measles/Rubella ImmunisationCampaign reached over 8 million children and necessitated an enormousexercise in planning and implementation throughout the UK. It also involveda vast number of doctors, nurses and other health personnel, particularly inthe school health service, and we are greatly indebted to them for its success.Susceptibility to measles in this target population has dropped dramaticallyand the few cases of measles since the campaign occur mostly in adults orinfants too young to have been protected by immunisation. The inclusion ofrubella vaccine has greatly reduced the susceptibility to rubella in males andtherefore the risk to susceptible pregnant women. It is logical to follow upthis campaign by introducing a two-dose strategy for MMR vaccine to preventfurther accumulations of susceptible children which could sustain futureepidemics of measles, and to allow the termination of the schoolgirl rubellaimmunisation programme. Other changes reflect the continuing importance ofsurveillance and of monitoring the epidemiology of infection not only in thiscountry but world-wide: the outbreaks of diphtheria in eastern Europe and theresurgence of tuberculosis are two problems of particular concern. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) continues to pay close attention to vaccine safety. Particular care was taken to monitor andinvestigate the apparent adverse reactions that occurred during theMeasles/Rubella Immunisation Campaign. In this edition separate chaptersare devoted to adverse reactions and to the problem of anaphylaxis; andinformation is provided on the vaccine damage payments scheme. It is alwaysdifficult to distinguish true vaccine reactions from coincidental events in achild's life, but doctors are urged to be meticulous in reporting reactions andin obtaining the details and appropriate specimens that will help in theirthorough investigation.PrefaceI should like to record my gratitude and that of my colleagues on the Joint Committee to all those who worked on this Handbook, but particularly to theeditors Dr David Salisbury and Dr Norman Begg, their contributors in theDepartment of Health, and to Mrs Maureen Ambler.

Before then,few people reached adulthood without having caught smallpox and the casefatality rates were often around 10%. At the end of the eighteenth century,smallpox caused one fifth of all deaths in Glasgow and nine out of ten peoplewho died of smallpox were under 5 years of age. One hundred and seventyyears later, smallpox virus was extinct. Through that course of events, we haveseen all of the key lessons of immunisation, and hopefully learnt from them.Few medical procedures or treatments can compare with the enormous benefitto humanity from immunisation, one of the safest and most cost effective ofinterventions. Within a remarkably short time of Jenner's first publication of his observations, thousands of people were being vaccinated. By the beginning ofthe nineteenth century, vaccination was being undertaken in many Europeancountries. Yet an anti-vaccination lobby was already making its efforts felt. Acartoon by Gillray in 1802 shows vaccine recipients growing cowlike parts,and spurious information about the risks of vaccination was often quoted as ifit were true. To overcome such resistance, vaccination was encouragedthrough the Vaccination Acts of 1840, 1841 and 1853 making vaccinationsuccessively universal, free, and finally compulsory. The Acts of 1861, 1867and 1871 made vaccination enforceable by the appointment of VaccinationOfficers and ultimately parents were liable to repeated fines until theirchildren were vaccinated. Legislation to make immunisation compulsory was widely unpopular and all legislation enforcing compulsion was finally withdrawn in 1948. The last large epidemic of smallpox (variola major) was in London in 1901- 02. After that time, importations continued, notably from Africa and Asia, apattern that has been repeated with poliomyelitis and measles. By the mid1970s, it was clear that the risk of death from the complications of smallpoxvaccination outweighed the predicted number of deaths that would followimportations, because of the success of the global programme of smallpoxeradication. Smallpox vaccination was then abandoned, apart from therequirements for international travel. The world's last naturally occurring caseof smallpox was in Somalia in October 1977. In May 1980, the World HealthAssembly accepted that smallpox had been eradicated worldwide. Theprinciples of its eradication - the use of an effective vaccine, with a strategythat focused on surveillance, along with a global coalition towards a concertedaction, fulfilled a prophecy made by Jenner that \"the annihilation of the SmallPox, the most dreadful scourge of the human species, must be the final resultForeword: The Legacy of Jennerof this practice\". We are now in a position to expect the global eradication of poliomyelitis within a few years, and hopefully, measles eradication willfollow. Two hundred years after Jenner's first observations, we are seeing a new era beginning for vaccines. With the application of genetic manipulationtechniques, better understanding of processes of infection and immunity, and awidespread recognition that investment in disease prevention is one of the bestuses of resources, we can expect ever more vaccines, and ever more diseaseseradicated. Sir Kenneth Calman Chief Medical OfficerForeword: The Legacy of Jenner What's New? Layout of the Memorandum A number of new chapters have been included in this edition, with more detailed information on contraindications and adverse reactions. A newchapter has been included on immunisation of laboratory staff. Theindividual vaccine chapters are in alphabetical order. Details of designatedyellow fever immunisation centres are available in 'Health Information forOverseas Travel, 1995'. At the end of the memorandum, you will find a list ofaddresses of local computer centres where immunisation data are managed. Inconjunction with existing local arrangements, you may find this helpful forupdating information, or for speeding up the transfer of information forchildren who have moved into, or out of, your locality. England, Scotland,Wales and Northern Ireland have now harmonised their processes forcollection and analysis of immunisation coverage data. Future editions willtherefore better reflect UK data on coverage, and on surveillance of targetdiseases. Diphtheria A low dose booster for school leavers is recommended as a combined vaccine (Td) in place of single antigen tetanus. This is to improve the immunity ofadults, in whom low levels of antibodies had been identified, and counters thethreat of the re-emergence of diphtheria as has been seen in Eastern Europe.Td can be used in place of tetanus for the treatment of tetanus prone woundsin Accident and Emergency Departments for young people aged over 13, if theschool-leaving booster has not already been given. The local HealthAuthority, NHS Trust, or Health Board should be informed, by return of an'unscheduled immunisation' form. Measles Mumps Rubella (MMR) From October 1996 a second dose of MMR vaccine is recommended for all children, to be given at the same time as the pre-school boosters. Childrenwho have had their pre-school boosters but who were too young to beincluded in the measles-rubella immunisation campaign of 1994 should begiven a second dose of MMR vaccine. The purpose of this programme is toprevent the re-accumulation of sufficient susceptible children to sustain futureepidemics, as happens with a single dose programme. The schoolgirl rubellaimmunisation programme has been brought to an end.1 What's New? Immunisation against Infectious Disease 1Hib vaccine Since the publication of the 1992 edition of 'Immunisation against Infectious Disease', Hib vaccine has become established in the routine immunisationprogramme. There is now good evidence that a course of Hib vaccine startedwith one product can be completed with another manufacturer's productwithout any deleterious effect. Combined products, where Hib isreconstituted with DTP for a single injection, are now being provided. Splenectomy Reducing the risk of overwhelming infection in asplenic and hyposplenic patients is addressed in the chapter on pneumococcal vaccine. Guidelines fromthe British Committee for Standards in Haematology, Clinical HaematologyTask Force were published in 1996. BCG BCG immunisation policy was reviewed during 1995/96. Immunisation of school children between the ages of 10 and 14 years continues to be part ofnational policy in addition to selective immunisation of higher risk groups. Allhealth authorities should ensure BCG immunisation is offered to allappropriate children. The BCG chapter draws attention to the importance of ordering and using the correct preparation of BCG vaccine for the technique being used: 'intradermal'vaccine is for routine intradermal administration using a separate needle andsyringe for each recipient; 'percutaneous' BCG should be used when thevaccine is administered by the multiple puncture technique - this technique is suitable for infants and very young children only . A new single use disposable Heaf testing device has recently become available. Travel Travel vaccines continue to be included in this memorandum, although detailed country by country risks, recommendations and a list of yellow fevercentres are now contained in the new companion volume 'Health Informationfor Overseas Travel'. 1 What's What's against Infectious Disease 3Rabies The recommendations for re-inforcing doses of rabies vaccine have changed: subjects who have received a full three dose primary course of vaccine do notrequire further reinforcing doses if, as in the UK, post-exposure treatment isreadily available, unless they are at continuous risk. The recommendations forpost-exposure rabies specific immunoglobulin have also changed and are basedon a risk assessment in each individual case. Immunity - Active and PassiveI2.1 Immunity can be induced, either actively (long term) or provided by passive transfer (short term), against a variety of bacterial and viral agents. I2.2 Active immunity is induced by using inactivated or attenuated live organisms or their products. Live attenuated vaccines include those forpoliomyelitis (OPV), measles, mumps inactivated contain such as influenzaand pneumococcal vaccine contain immunising components of the organisms;tetanus and diphtheria vaccines contain toxoid - that is, toxins inactivated bytreatment with formaldehyde. I2.3 Vaccines produce their protective effect by inducing cell mediated immunity and serum antibodies which can be demonstrated by their detectionin the serum. Live vaccines promote cell mediated immunity, which, afterBCG immunisation, is demonstrated by a positive tuberculin skin test. I2.4 A first injection of inactivated vaccine or toxoid in a subject without prior exposure to the antigen produces a slow antibody or antitoxinresponse of predominantly IgM antibody - the primary response. Twoinjections may be needed to produce such a response. Depending on thepotency of the product and time interval, further injections will lead to anaccelerated response in which the antibody or antitoxin titre (IgG) rises to ahigher level - the secondary response. Following a full course, the antibody orantitoxin levels remain high for months or years, but even if the level ofdetectable antibody falls, the immune mechanism has been sensitised and afurther dose of vaccine reinforces immunity. I2.5 Some inactivated vaccines contain adjuvants (substances which enhance the antibody response). Examples are aluminium phosphate andaluminium hydroxide which are contained in adsorbeddiphtheria/tetanus/pertussis vaccine and adsorbed diphtheria/tetanus vaccine. I2.6 In many individuals, live attenuated virus vaccines such as measles, mumps and rubella promote a full, long-lasting antibody response after onedose. Live poliomyelitis vaccine (OPV) requires three doses. An importantadditional effect of oral poliomyelitis vaccine is the establishment of localimmunity in the intestine. 2 Immunity - Active and Passive Immunisation against Infectious Disease 5I2.7 Viruses that are used for production of vaccines must be grown in cells. A variety of cell types are used for this purpose. Some viruses (measles,mumps, yellow fever, influenza) are grown in chick cells; some polio virusesare grown in monkey kidney cells. Rubella, rabies, hepatitis A and some polioviruses are grown in human diploid cells. This cell line was derived from asingle sample of fetal lung tissue obtained following a termination ofpregnancy for medical indications 30 years ago. Great care is taken to ensurethat there are no extraneous viruses in the cell cultures. I2.8 Passive immunity results from the injection of human immunoglobulin (see Chapter 19); the protection afforded is immediate butlasts only a few weeks. There are two types: (i) Human normal immunoglobulin (HNIG) derived from the pooled plasma of donors and containing antibody to infectious agents which arecurrently prevalent in the general population. Examples of the use of HNIGare the protection of immunosuppressed children exposed to measles, andprotection of individuals against hepatitis A. (ii) Specific immunoglobulins for tetanus, hepatitis B, rabies and varicella- zoster. These are obtained from the pooled blood of convalescent patients,donors recently immunised with the relevant vaccine, or those who onscreening are found to have sufficiently high antibody titres. Each specificimmunoglobulin therefore contains antibody at a higher titre than that presentin normal immunoglobulin. I2.9 Recommendations for the use of normal and specific immunoglobulins are given in the relevant chapters.2 Immunity - Active and PassiveImmunity - Active and Passive 6 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseConsentI3.1 Consent must always be obtained before immunisation. Recent studies, undertaken on behalf of the Health Education Authority and theDepartment of Health, have shown the importance that parents attach tobeing involved in the decision making process for immunisation. Care shouldbe taken to ensure that parents feel that their questions have been adequatelyanswered and that their concerns about immunisation have been sensitivelyconsidered. For some questions, advice may need to be sought from aConsultant Paediatrician, Consultant in Communicable Disease Control orDistrict (Health Board) Immunisation Co-ordinator. I3.2 Written consent provides a permanent record, but consent - either written or verbal - is required at the time of each immunisation after thechild's fitness and suitability have been established (see 3.4). I3.3 Consent obtained before the occasion upon which a child is brought for immunisation is only an agreement for the child to be included inthe immunisation programme. I3.4 Bringing a child for immunisation after an invitation to attend for this purpose may be viewed as acceptance that the child may be immunised.When a child is brought for this purpose, and fitness and suitability have beenestablished, consent to that immunisation may be implied in the absence of anyexpressed reservation to the immunisation proceeding at that stage. I3.5 Similarly, the attendance of a child at school on the day that the parent/guardian has been advised that the child will be immunised may also beviewed as acceptance that the child may be immunised, in the absence of anyreservation expressed to the contrary. However, because of theparent/guardian's legal responsibilities in respect of the child's attendance atschool, the possibility that immunisation will be offered should be made clearto the parent/guardian. I3.6 A child under 16 years of age may give consent for immunisation, provided he or she understands fully the benefits and risks involved. However,the child should be encouraged to involve a parent/guardian, if possible, in thedecision. I3.7 Where a child under 16 who fully understands the benefits and risks of the proposed immunisation wishes to refuse the immunisation, thatwish should be respected. I3.8 If a child's fitness and suitability cannot be established, immunisation should be deferred. Specialist advice may need to be obtained (see 3.1).3 Consent Immunisation against Infectious Disease 7Storage, Distribution and Disposal of VaccinesI4.1 Manufacturers' recommendations on storage must be observed and care should be taken to ensure that, on receipt, vaccines are checked againstthe order, examined for leakage or other damage and immediately placedunder the required storage conditions. Vaccines must not be kept attemperatures below 0\u00b0C as freezing can cause deterioration of the vaccine andbreakage of the container. I4.2 A pharmacist or other suitably trained person should be nominated for each clinic as being responsible for the safe storage of vaccines, and shouldwork to a written procedure developed to meet local needs. This personshould have a designated deputy to cover in times of absence. General medicalpractitioners should make similar arrangements. I4.3 Care should be taken to avoid over-ordering or stockpiling vaccines. Systems should be developed to ensure stock rotation, and regularchecks should be made to remove time expired vaccines. I4.4 Vaccines should be stored in the refrigerator, allowing air to circulate around the packages. They should not be stored on the shelves or in storage compartments of the refrigerator door. I4.5 Food and drink should not be stored in refrigerators used for vaccines. Door opening should be kept to a minimum. I4.6 Domestic refrigerators are not designed for storage of vaccines and wherever possible should not be used. Refrigerators specifically for storage ofmedicinal products are available from a number of suppliers (see 4.16). I4.7 Care should be taken to ensure that the electricity supply to the vaccine storage refrigerator cannot be accidentally interrupted e.g. by using aswitchless socket or by placing cautionary notices on plugs and sockets. I4.8 A maximum/minimum thermometer should be used in refrigerators where vaccines are stored, irrespective of whether the refrigerator incorporatesa temperature indicator dial. Such thermometers may be purchased fromreputable laboratory suppliers, some of whom are able to provide a certificateof conformance/calibration (see 4.16). More sophisticated temperaturerecording devices are available which may be particularly useful for validationand periodic audit of storage and transport facilities. 4 Storage, Distribution and Disposal of Vaccines Immunisation against Infectious Disease 9I4.9 The maximum and minimum temperatures reached should be monitored and recorded regularly - preferably daily but at least at thebeginning of each immunisation session. Temperature record logs are bestkept close to the refrigerator for ease of reference. The written procedurereferred to in 4.2 should indicate the action to be taken in the event of thetemperature going outside the specified range. I4.10 Refrigerators should be defrosted regularly. Special care should be taken during defrosting to ensure that the temperature of the vaccine does notgo outside the specified range. An alternative refrigerator or insulatedcontainers should be used for vaccine storage during defrosting ofrefrigerators. I4.11 If vaccines have been despatched by post, they should not be accepted by the recipient if more than 48 hours have elapsed since posting.The date and time of dispatch should be clearly marked. I4.12 The use of cool-boxes or insulated containers to transport vaccines should be validated to ensure that the required temperature is maintainedthroughout the period of transit. Care should be taken to keep frozen ice-packs out of direct contact with the vaccine as this can cause the product tofreeze. I4.13 Reconstituted vaccine must be used within the recommended period, varying from one to four hours, according to the manufacturer'sinstructions. Single dose containers are preferable; once opened, multi-dosevials must not be kept after the end of the session and any vaccine left unusedmust be discarded. I4.14 Unused vaccine, spent or partly spent vials should be disposed of safely, preferably by heat inactivation or incineration. Contaminated wasteand spillage should be dealt with by heat sterilisation, incineration or chemicaldisinfection as appropriate. Those providing or handling live vaccines shouldconsult their local Consultant in Communicable Disease Control, Consultantin Public Health Medicine (CPHM), Consultant in Communicable Disease andEnvironmental Health (CD & EH) in Scotland, or Infection ControlCommittee about suitable procedures. I4.15 The procedures being followed for storage, distribution and disposal of vaccines should be audited regularly to ensure that they complywith the written procedure (see 4.2).4 Storage, Distribution and Disposal of VaccinesStorage, Distribution and Disposal of Vaccines 10 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseStorage, Distribution and Disposal of VaccinesI4.16 Advice on suppliers of refrigeration equipment and accessories is available from: Communicable Disease Branch Department of Health Area 708, Wellington House 133-155 Waterloo Road London SE1 8UG (Tel 3DE I 4.17 Bibliography The safe disposal of clinical waste. Health and Safety Commission: Health Services Advisory Committee, 1992.HMSO ISBN 0 11 883641 2.4 Storage, Distribution and Disposal of Vaccines Immunisation against Infectious Disease 11Immunisation ProceduresI5.1 Preliminary points I5.1.1 The recommendations set out in the 'Green Book' are based on the current expert advice available to the Joint Committee onVaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), although in some circumstancesthey may differ from that contained in the vaccine manufacturers' datasheets. These recommendations reflect present national immunisationpolicy. I5.1.2 The leaflets supplied with the product and prepared by the manufacturer in consultation with the Licensing Authority should beread, but see 5.1.1. I5.1.3 The identity of the vaccine must be checked to ensure the right product is used in the appropriate way on every occasion. I5.1.4 The expiry date must be noted. Vaccines should not be used after the expiry date on the label. I5.1.5 The date of immunisation, title of vaccine and batch number must be recorded on the recipient's record. When two vaccines are given simultaneously, the relevant sites should be recorded to allow any reactions to be related to the causative vaccine. I5.1.6 The recommended storage conditions must have been observed (see Chapter 4). 5 Immunisation Procedures Immunisation against Infectious Disease 13Consent must be obtained (see Chapter 3), and suitability for immunisationestablished. Doctors and nurses providing immunisation should have received training and be proficient in the appropriate techniques. Preparations must be made for the management of anaphylaxis and other immediate reactions (see 10.6).I5.2 Reconstitution of vaccines I5.2.1 Freeze dried vaccines must be reconstituted with the diluent supplied and used within the recommended period after reconstitution(see 4.13). I5.2.2 Before injection the colour of the product must be checked with that stated by the manufacturer in the package insert. The diluentshould be added slowly to avoid frothing. A sterile 1ml syringe with a21G needle should be used for reconstituting the vaccine, and a smallergauge needle for injection (see 5.5), unless only one needle is suppliedwith a pre-filled syringe (e.g. Hib/DTP). I 5.3 Cleaning of skin I5.3.1 If the skin is to be cleaned, alcohol and other disinfecting agents must be allowed to evaporate before injection of vaccine sincethey can inactivate live vaccine preparations. I 5.4 Route of administration I5.4.1 By mouth Oral polio vaccine must never be injected. OPV should not be allowed to remain at room temperature awaiting or following an immunisationas this may decrease the potency of the vaccine. I5.4.2 Subcutaneous and intramuscular injection With the exception of BCG, oral typhoid vaccine and OPV, all vaccines should be given by intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injection. Ininfants, the antero-lateral aspect of the thigh or upper arm arerecommended. If the buttock is used, injection into the upper outerquadrant avoids the risk of sciatic nerve damage. Injection into fattytissue of the buttock has been shown to reduce the efficacy of hepatitis Bvaccine.5 Immunisation ProceduresImmunisation Procedures 14 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseImmunisation (a) TechniqueBCG vaccine is always given intradermally; rabies, cholera and typhoid vaccines may also be given this way. When giving an intradermalinjection, the operator should stretch the skin between the thumb andforefinger of one hand, and with the other slowly insert the needle (size25G), bevel upwards, for about 2mm into the superficial layers of thedermis, almost parallel with the surface. A raised, blanched bleb showingthe tips of the hair follicles is a sign that the injection has been madecorrectly and its diameter gives a useful indication of the amount that hasbeen injected. Considerable resistance is felt from a correctly givenintradermal injection. If this is not felt, and it is suspected that the needleis too deep, it should be removed and reinserted before more vaccine isgiven. A bleb of 7mm diameter is approximately equivalent to 0.1ml.5 Immunisation Procedures Immunisation against Infectious Disease 15 Needle orientation for intradermal, subcutaneous and intramuscular injections.Intradermal (26 G needle)Subcutaneous (25 G needle)Intramuscular (25 G needle)(b) Suitable sites for intradermal injections For BCG the site of injection is over the insertion of the left deltoid muscle; the tip of the shoulder must be avoided because of the increasedrisk of keloid formation at this site (see 32.20.1). For tuberculin sensitivity tests (Mantoux or Heaf), intradermal injections are given in the middle of the flexor surface of the forearm.This site should not be used for injecting vaccines. The use of jet injectors is notrecommended. For intradermal rabies vaccine, the site of injection is behind the posterior border of the distal portion of the deltoid muscle. I5.5 Administration For deep subcutaneous or intramuscular immunisation in infants, a 23 or 25G needle should be used. For adults, a 23G needle is recommended.Intradermal immunisations should use a Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseImmunisation by NursesI6.1 A doctor may delegate responsibility for immunisation to a nurse provided the following conditions are fulfilled: (i) The nurse is willing to be professionally accountable for this work as defined in the UKCC guidance on the 'Scope of Professional Practice'. (ii) The nurse has received training and is competent in all aspects of immunisation, including the contraindications to specific vaccines. (iii) Adequate training has been given in the recognition and treatment of anaphylaxis. I6.2 If these conditions are fulfilled and nurses carry out the immunisa- tion in accordance with accepted District Health Authority, NHS Trust orHealth Board policy, the Authority/Trust/Board will accept responsibility forimmunisation by nurses. Similarly, nurses employed by general practitionersshould work to agreed protocols including all the above conditions.6 Immunisation by Nurses Immunisation against Infectious Disease 17Indications and Contraindications I7.1 Special risk groups I7.1.1 Some conditions increase the risk of complications from infectious diseases and children and adults with such conditions shouldbe immunised as a matter of priority . These conditions include the following: asthma, chronic lung and congenital heart diseases, Down'ssyndrome, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection (see 7.4),small for dates babies and those born prematurely. This last groupshould be immunised according to the recommended schedule from twomonths after birth, irrespective of the extent of prematurity. Studies haveshown that antibody responses and adverse events are not significantlydifferent in pre-term and term infants immunised 2, 3 and 4 monthsafter birth. I7.1.2 When babies are immunised in Special Care Units, or children are immunised opportunistically in Accident and EmergencyUnits or in-patient facilities, it is most important that a record of theimmunisation is sent to the Health Authority, NHS Trust or HealthBoard by return of an 'unscheduled immunisation' form. I7.1.3 Unimmunised children and others with unknown immunisation histories Some children, for a variety of reasons, may not have been immunised or their immunisation history may be unknown. If children coming to theUK are not known to have been completely immunised, they should beassumed to be unimmunised and a full course of immunisations shouldbe planned. For children under 10 years of age, this should be the fullUK primary immunisation schedule of 3 doses of diphtheria, tetanus,pertussis and oral polio vaccine (Hib only up to 4 years, 3 doses forchildren under 1 year, only one dose for children aged 1 to 4 years) withboosting for diphtheria, tetanus and polio, 5 and 10 years thereafter.Children of all ages above 12 months should receive two doses ofMMR, separated by at least 3 months. For children over 10 years of age,7 Indications and Contraindications Immunisation against Infectious Disease 19It is every child's right to be protected against infectious diseases. No childshould be denied immunisation without serious thought as to theconsequences, both for the individual child and for the community. Wherethere is any doubt, advice should be sought from a Consultant Paediatrician,Consultant in Communicable Disease Control or District (Health Board)Immunisation Co-ordinator.Td should be used along with MMR and OPV. Boosting with Td and OPV should be given 5 and 10 years later. In the event of a severeadverse reaction, blood should be taken for tetanus antibody titres asthese may provide a marker for previous immunisation. No furtherdiphtheria, tetanus and pertussis immunisations are needed in childrenwhere there is evidence of previous immunisation including booster doses;immunisation should be completed with OPV and Hib if appropriate. I7.1.4 Children coming to the United Kingdom, part way through their immunisation schedule, should be transferred onto the standard UKschedule, as appropriate for their age. I7.1.5 Children and adults with no spleen, or who have functional hyposplenism, are at increased risk from bacterial infections, mostcommonly caused by encapsulated organisms. Such infection is mostcommon in the first two years after splenectomy; the risk is greatestamongst children but persists into adult life. The following vaccines arerecommended in addition to those in the routine schedule: pneumococcalvaccine (over two years of age, see Chapter 25), Hib vaccine (irrespectiveof age, see Chapter 16), influenza (Chapter 20), meningococcal A and Cvaccine (see Chapter 23). Where possible, immunisation should be giventwo weeks before splenectomy together with advice about the increasedrisk of infection. I7.1.6 Adults and children who receive haemodialysis are at increased risk of hepatitis B and hepatitis C although these risks havedeclined. Haemodialysis patients should be screened for serologicalevidence of hepatitis B immunity and antibody negative individualsshould have three doses of hepatitis B vaccine, ideally before dialysiscommences or as soon as possible thereafter. In haemodialysis patients,protection only lasts as long as anti-HBs antibodies remain over10miu/ml. Patients on haemodialysis should be monitored annually foranti-HBs antibodies and re-immunised if antibodies fall below this level.Recipients of renal transplants and individuals with chronic renal diseaseare at increased risk of infection and should be considered for annualinfluenza immunisation, Hib and pneumococcal immunisation. I 7.2 General Contraindications I7.2.1 If an individual is suffering from an acute illness, immunisation should be postponed until recovery has occurred. Minorinfections without fever or systemic upset are not reasons to postpone7 Indications and ContraindicationsIndications and Contraindications 20 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseIndications and Contraindicationsimmunisation. Antibody responses and incidence of adverse reactions were the same in children with or without acute mild illness, when givenMMR vaccine. The acute illnesses were upper respiratory tract infection,diarrhoea or otitis media. I7.2.2 Immunisation should not be carried out in individuals who have a definite history of a severe local or general reaction to apreceding dose. Detailed enquiry may reveal that the reported reactiondoes not match the specifications below and immunisation can proceed.Appropriate specialist advice should be sought if there is doubt. Thefollowing reactions should be regarded as severe: Local: an extensive area of redness and swelling which becomes indurated and involves most of the antero-lateral surface of the thigh or a major part of the circumference of the upper arm. General: fever equal to or more than 39.5\u00b0C within 48 hours of vaccine; for more than 4 hours; convulsions or encephalopathyoccurring within 72 hours. I7.2.3 Although there is evidence to suggest that rubella and polio vaccines are not teratogenic (see Chapter 28), live vaccines should not beadministered to pregnant women because of the theoretical possibility ofharm to the fetus. Where there is a significant risk of exposure to thedisease, for example to poliomyelitis or yellow fever, the need forimmunisation outweighs any possible risk to the fetus. I 7.3 Live Vaccines - special risk groups I7.3.1 There are some individuals for whom there may be risks if they are given live vaccines. Inactivated vaccines are not dangerous to theserecipients but may be ineffective. These individuals may not be able tomake a normal immune response to live vaccines and could suffer fromsevere manifestations such as disseminated infection with BCG orparalytic poliomyelitis from vaccine virus. These individuals include: I7.3.2 (a) All patients currently being treated for malignant diseasewith chemotherapy or generalised radiotherapy, or within 6months of terminating such treatment. 7 Indications and Contraindications Immunisation against Infectious Disease 21(b) All patients who have received an organ transplant and are currently on immunosuppressive treatment. I7.3.3 Patients who within the previous six months have received a bone marrow transplant. Such individuals, irrespective of age, shouldhave their immunity to diphtheria, tetanus, polio, measles, mumps, rubellaand Hib checked six months after transplantation and be immunisedappropriately. Such tests are difficult to interpret if performed withinthree months after the receipt of any blood product, including HNIG. I7.3.4 Children who receive prednisolone, orally or rectally, at a daily dose (or its equivalent) of 2 mg/kg/day for at least one week, or 1mg/kg/day for one month. For adults, an equivalent dose is harder todefine but immunosuppression should be considered in those whoreceive 40 mg prednisolone per day for more than one week.Corticosteroids, administered by other routes, such as aerosols, topicallyor intra-articularly, are not immunosuppressive. Administration of livevaccines should be postponed for at least three months afterimmunosuppressive treatment has stopped, or three months after levelshave been reached that are not associated with immunosuppression. I7.3.5 Lower doses of steroids, given in combination with cytotoxic drugs (including anti thymocyte globulin or other immunosuppressants)should be considered to cause immunosuppression. The advice of thephysician in charge or immunologist should be sought. I7.3.6 Occasionally, there may be individuals on lower doses of steroids or other immunosuppressants for prolonged periods, or whobecause of their underlying disease, may be immunosuppressed, and areat increased risk of infection. The clinician should ideally discuss theirmanagement with a consultant in infectious disease, microbiology,paediatrics or relevant specialist physician. I7.3.7 Patients with evidence of impaired cell mediated immunity , for example HIV infection with current symptoms, Severe CombinedImmunodeficiency Syndrome, Di George Syndrome and other combinedimmunodeficiency syndromes. Patients with minor deficiencies of antibodies are not at risk; those with major antibody deficiencies will be receiving antibodies in their immunoglobulin treatment preparations andhence are not at risk from receipt of live vaccines. Because the patient isreceiving immunoglobulin preparations, live vaccines are likely to beineffective, apart from yellow fever vaccine as it is most unlikely that thereare significant amounts of anti-yellow fever antibodies in imm unoglobulin.7 Indications and ContraindicationsIndications and Contraindications 22 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseIndications and ContraindicationsI7.3.8 For HIV positive individuals, see 7.4 I7.3.9 After exposure to measles or chickenpox (see Chapters 22 and 34), individuals who fulfil the above criteria, and are susceptible tomeasles or chickenpox on the grounds of history or antibody titres,should be given an injection of the appropriate preparation ofimmunoglobulin as soon as possible. I 7.4 Immunisation of individuals with antibody to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV positive) I7.4.1 HIV positive individuals with or without symptoms should receive the following as appropriate: Live HIV positive symptomatic individuals, inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) may be used instead of OPV, at the discretion of theclinician. I7.4.3 HIV positive individuals should notreceive BCG vaccine; there have been reports of dissemination of BCG in HIV positiveindividuals. I7.4.4 Yellow fever vaccine should not be given to either symptomatic or asymptomatic HIV positive individuals since there is asyet insufficient evidence as to the safety of its use. Travellers should betold of this uncertainty and advised not to be immunised unless there arecompelling reasons. If such travellers still intend to visit countries wherea yellow fever certificate is required for entry, then they should obtain aletter of exemption from a medical practitioner. I7.4.5 No harmful effects have been reported following live attenuated vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella and polio in HIV positive individuals who are at increased risk from these diseases.Immunisation of known measles seronegative HIV positive individuals isadvised; a measurable antibody response may occur in only somevaccinees. It should be noted that in HIV positive individuals, polio virusmay be excreted for longer periods than in other people. Contacts of a7 Indications and Contraindications Immunisation against Infectious Disease 23recently immunised HIV positive individual should be warned of this, and of the need for washing their hands after changing an immunisedinfant's nappies. For HIV positive contacts of an immunised individual(whether that individual is HIV positive or not) the potential risk ofinfection is greater than that in non-HIV individuals. I7.4.6 Vaccine efficacy may be reduced in HIV positive individuals. Consideration should be given to the use of normal immunoglobulin forHIV positive individuals after exposure to measles (see 22.9). I7.4.7 For HIV positive individuals exposed to chickenpox or zoster , see 34.5 I7.4.8 HIV positive individuals also pneumococcal, rabies, hepatitis A and meningococcal A+C vaccines. NB. Some of the above advice differs from that for other immunocompromised patients (7.3). I 7.5 Immunisation intervals I7.5.1 Live virus vaccines, with the exception of yellow fever vaccine, should not be given during the three months following injectionof immunoglobulin because the immune response may be inhibited.Human normal immunoglobulin obtained from UK residents is unlikelyto contain antibody to yellow fever virus which would inactivate thevaccine. In travellers, when time is short and there is a significant risk ofexposure to polio, vaccine should be given even if immunoglobulin has been given at any time in the previous three months. I7.5.2 If it is necessary to administer more than one live vaccine at the same time, they should either be given simultaneously in differentsites (unless a combined preparation is used) or in theory be separatedby a period of at least three weeks. There are no current data usingpresently available vaccines to support this recommendation whichcame from earlier observations about 'take rates' of smallpoxvaccination; these may have been reduced if another live vaccine hadbeen given shortly before smallpox vaccination. It probably has little7 Indications and ContraindicationsIndications and Contraindications 24 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseSpecific contraindications to individual vaccines are given in the relevant chapters and must be observed.Indications and Contraindicationsrelevance for intervals between oral polio vaccine and other presently used live virus vaccines. It is recommended that a three week intervalshould be allowed between the administration of live virus vaccinesespecially measles vaccine, and tuberculin testing; there is experiencethat shows that measles infection or immunisation can give false negativeresults in tuberculin positive individuals. No interval needs to beobserved between the administration of live and inactivated vaccines. I 7.6 The following conditions are NOT contraindications to immunisation: a. Family history of any adverse reactions following immunisation. b. Previous history of pertussis, measles, rubella or mumps infection.c. Prematurity: immunisation should not be postponed. d. Stable neurological conditions such as cerebral palsy and Down's syndrome. e. Contact with an infectious disease. f. Asthma, eczema, hay fever or 'snuffles'.g. Treatment with antibiotics or locally-acting (eg topical or inhaled) steroids. h. Child's mother is pregnant.i. Child being breast fed.j. History of jaundice after birth.k. Under a certain weight.l. Over the age in immunisation schedule.m. 'Replacement' corticosteroids.7 and 25I7.7 Other contraindication issues I7.7.1 A history of allergy contraindication. Hypersensitivity to egg contraindicates influenza vaccine; previousanaphylactic reaction to egg contraindicates influenza and yellow fever vaccines. There is increasing evidence that MMR vaccine can be safelygiven even to children with a history of previous anaphylaxis after eggingestion (see 22.7). I7.7.2 A personal or family history of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's or ulcerative colitis) does not contraindicate measles or MMRimmunisation. Evidence for an association between measles vaccine andinflammatory bowel disease is not convincing. I7.7.3 Family history of convulsions (see 24.4.8). Where there is a close family history (parents or sibling) of febrile convulsions, there is anincreased chance that a febrile convulsion could follow a fever in avaccine recipient. Immunisation should be carried out after advice on theprevention of pyrexia has been given (see 24.5.2). I7.7.4 Siblings and close contacts of immunosuppressed children should be immunised against measles, mumps and rubella. There is no risk of transmission of virus following immunisation. I7.7.5 Oral poliomyelitis vaccine (OPV) should notbe given to immunosuppressed children, their siblings or other household contacts.Inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine should be given instead; this shouldalso be given to immunosuppressed adults and their contacts (see 26.6.1and 26.6.3). I7.7.6 Recently immunised children may be taken swimming, even if they have been given OPV. Similarly, there is no risk of anunimmunised child contracting vaccine associated poliomyelitis from arecently immunised child if they are taken swimming. In such publicplaces, care must be taken to dispose of soiled napkins withoutcontaminating facilities that others might use. I7.7.7 Surgery is not a contraindication to immunisation, nor is recent immunisation a contraindication to or surgery. Recentreceipt of OPV not contraindicate tonsillectomy. In the UnitedStates, where recent OPV administration has never been considered acontraindication for tonsillectomy, there has been no recorded case ofvaccine associated poliomyelitis following this procedure.7 Indications and ContraindicationsIndications 26 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseIndications and ContraindicationsI7.7.8 Homoeopathy: the Council of the Faculty of Homoeopathy strongly supports the immunisation programme and has stated thatimmunisation should be carried out in the normal way using theconventional tested and approved vaccines, in the absence of medicalcontraindications.

Immunization infected with Infectious Disease 27Adverse ReactionsI8.1 Surveillance and reporting of suspected adverse reactions I8.1.1 All vaccines are extensively tested by their manufacturers prior to licensing for quality, safety and efficacy. In addition, manufacturers must submitsamples of each batch and results of their own potency, safety and purity testsfor independent assessment before that batch can be released into general use.However, careful surveillance must still be maintained. I8.1.2 The Post Licensing Division of the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) has responsibility for monitoring the safety of all marketedmedicines including vaccines. Spontaneous reports of adverse drug reactions(ADRs) are received from UK doctors, dentists and coroners under thevoluntary 'Yellow Card' scheme, whilst there is a statutory requirement forpharmaceutical companies to report serious adverse reactions to theirproducts on a world-wide basis. Such reports of suspected adverse reactionsare classified and entered onto a national computer database operated by theMCA. The number, pattern and severity of reported reactions are regularlyreviewed, and appropriate investigation and action initiated if a possibleproblem is identified. Important information on the safety of vaccines isalso collected from other sources, including the medical literature, post-marketing safety studies and an international spontaneous ADR database. I8.1.3 The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) and Committee on the Safety of Medicines are independentcommittees which provide expert advice on immunisation policy and thequality, safety and efficacy of vaccines respectively. I8.1.4 The success of the spontaneous reporting system for vaccines depends on early, complete and accurate reporting of suspected ADRsthrough the yellow cards. For currently marketed vaccines, serious suspected reactions, including those which are fatal, life-threatening, disabling,incapacitating or which result in hospitalisation should be reported; thisapplies to all serious reactions whether or not such reactions have beenpreviously recognised. For new vaccine formulations, which have a blacktriangle, allsuspected reactions should be reported. When submitting a yellow card for an adverse reaction, it is most important that the vaccine iscorrectly identified, so that it is clear which formulation has been used; forexample, combined Tetanus and low dose diphtheria vaccine (Td) should bedistinguished from Diphtheria/Tetanus vaccine (DT). Wherever possible thebatch number should be provided.It is important to give as much information as possible about the nature,8 Adverse Reactions Immunisation against Infectious Disease 29timing and severity of the observed reaction, if the patient was hospitalised, what treatment was given and the final outcome. Information about other factors suchas concomitant medication, underlying disease, allergies or family history shouldbe provided whenever possible. The provision of additional information such astest results or relevant hospital correspondence is always helpful. If further information becomes available after reporting a reaction, this should be sent to the MCA to help in the assessment of a suspected reaction. I8.1.5 Yellow cards are supplied to general practitioners and pharmacists, and are available through the CSM Freefone or by writing to 1 Nine Elms Lane,London SW8 5NQ. They are also available at the back of the British NationalFormulary, the APBI data sheet compendium and FP10s. I8.1.6 Most of the reports submitted on Yellow Cards are of self-limiting illness, such as fever, rashes or injection site reactions which are associated witha complete recovery. More serious reactions are reported less frequently.Although a reaction might occur in close temporal association with animmunisation, often it can be very difficult to assess whether or not there is acausal link. Most reported reactions can occur independently of immunisationand there are few specific tests that can establish or exclude whether a vaccinecaused a reported reaction. The probability that a vaccine has played a causalrole in an event is increased if the event has occurred at a time interval after theimmunisation which is in accordance with the known incubation periods of liveorganisms. For example, pyrexial illness occurring 5-10 days after measlesimmunisation, or parotid swelling three weeks after mumps immunisation,would be consistent with the incubation periods for these particular viruses.Pyrexia occurring less than 3 days after measles vaccine is unlikely to be causedby the immunisation and an intercurrent infection is much more likely. I8.1.7 Assessing the probability of whether a reaction is caused by a vaccine is particularly difficult in young children. Illness such as fever or convulsionsoccur frequently in the first year of life and almost every child is immunised on 3separate occasions in this period. Interpretation of the significance of clinicalevents occurring after immunisation depends on the biological plausibility, anidentified excess of events in a specified post-immunisation period comparedagainst background rates, and laboratory evidence that support the association.In general, the risk of serious illness following natural infection far outweighs anypossible risk from the relevant vaccine.8 Adverse ReactionsAdverse Reactions 30 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseAdverse ReactionsI8.1.8 From 1 November 1990 to 31 October 1995 there were 5433 reports of suspected adverse reactions to all vaccines given to children under15 years of age reported through the Yellow Card scheme. The number ofreports is based on the date each report was received. Approximately 80million doses of vaccines were distributed as part of the childhood programme(some of these vaccines are also given to adults) in the UK in those 5 years.Most reports were of mild, self-limiting illness, such as fever, rashes andinjection site reactions. During 1995, there were 648 yellow card reports ofsuspected adverse reactions relating to routinely administered childhoodvaccines for the UK as a whole. Again, most reports were of mild, self-limiting illness such as fever, rashes and injection site reactions. There were152 reports that included reactions classified as 'serious'. To put this inperspective, over 14 million doses of these vaccines were distributed in the UKin 1995. Thus, 'serious' suspected reactions were reported at a rate ofapproximately one per hundred thousand distributed doses of vaccine. I8.1.9 Immunisation can rarely increase the risk of a specific disease. By linking computer records of hospital admissions for idiopathicthrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and community computer records ofMMR immunisation, a positive association was found with an absoluterisk of ITP in one in every 24,000 immunisations. Within certain groups, the evidence of harm from immunisation is not supported. Whilst natural rubella infection is often associated witharthropathy, especially in adult women, one recent retrospective case controlstudy showed no increase in risk of arthropathy in under-immune womenimmunised post partum compared, with unimmunised controls. A US studyof re-immunisation of college students with MMR vaccine showed no increasein fever or rash in immunised students, compared with unimmunised controls. Although cases of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) have been reported within a short time of DTP immunisation, there is no evidencethat the risk is increased. Indeed there is some evidence that immunisedinfants are at decreased risk from SIDS. I8.1.10 Serious neurological reactions such as encephalitis may occur very rarely after vaccines. All such cases should be investigated and referredto hospital in the normal way. A final clinical diagnosis of a suspectedreaction to a vaccine should only be made once all other causes have beenexcluded. A suspected serious adverse reaction however, can still bereported on a Yellow Card before other results become available. Furtherinformation can always be submitted at a later date (see 8.1.4).8 Adverse Reactions Immunisation against Infectious Disease 31I8.1.11 After several reports of severe encephalopathy and permanent brain damage in children who had received pertussis vaccine, the NationalChildhood Encephalopathy Study was set up to examine the associationbetween pertussis immunisation and encephalopathic disorders. After threeyears of case finding and follow-up, it was concluded that if there was anincreased risk of encephalopathy and permanent brain damage or deathafter pertussis vaccine, it was too small to be demonstrated statistically. I8.1.12 Serious reactions to vaccine have been reviewed by an expert committee convened by the Institute of Medicine in the United States. For onlya few conditions was there enough available information to suggest a possibleor probable causal relationship with a vaccine (see table). Furthermore, theAmerican Academy of Paediatrics has recently stated that it concurs with thead hoc sub-committee of the US National Vaccine Advisory Committee and the US Advisory Committee on Immunisation Pra ctices that whole-cell pertussis vaccine has not been proven to be a cause of brain damage. 8 Adverse ReactionsAdverse Reactions 32 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseEvidence favours acceptance Evidence establishes a of a causal relationship causal relationship DTP Acute encephalopathy Anaphylaxis Shock and unusual shock- Protracted inconsolablelike state crying OPV/IPV Guillain Barr\u00e9 Syndrome Poliomyelitis in vaccine Syndrome (OPV)*** recipient or contact (OPV) Death from polio vaccine strain arthritis T/DT/Td Syndrome Anaphylaxis Brachial neuritis Hepatitis B - Anaphylaxis * These data come primarily from individuals proven to be immunocompromised. ** See 8.1.9 for a counter view.*** Subsequently retractedAdverse ReactionsBibliography: Farrington P et al.

Claimants are asked to give details of all the immunisations theyhave been given. I9.1.2 Claims can also be made if someone is thought to be severely disabled because their mother was immunised against any of the specifieddiseases while she was pregnant orif someone is thought to be severely disabled because they have been in close contact with a person who hasbeen immunised against polio (using orally administered vaccine). Thepayment is not compensation but is designed to ease the present and future burdens of those suffering from vaccine damage and their families. Theamount payable is \u00a330,000 for claims made on or after 15 April 1991. I 9.2 The 80% disability test The severity of disablement in individual cases is assessed on the same basis as for the Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit Scheme - a widely accepted testof severity. In physical terms, 80% disablement equates to, for example,amputation below the hip or below the shoulder, or to deafness so severe thatthe sufferer cannot hear a shout beyond a distance of 3 feet. Similarly,somebody whose corrected vision was 6/60 in both eyes may be considered as80% disabled. These levels of disablement are easily described and a doctorwho has been given special training required to make such assessments wouldbe able to make a balanced judgement on the overall level of disability.9 Vaccine Damage Payments Scheme Immunisation against Infectious Disease 35I9.3 Time and age limits I9.3.1 The disabled person must be 2 or more years old and must have been immunised in the UK or the Isle of Man unless they or someone in theirfamily were in the armed forces and the immunisation was given as part ofthe armed services medical facilities. I9.3.2 They must have been immunised before their 18th birthday, unless the immunisation was against polio or rubella or during anoutbreak given within the UK or the Isle of Man. I9.3.3 The claim must be made within 6 years of the date of immunisation or of the child reaching the age of 2 - whichever is the later. I 9.4 How to claim Claimants can get a claim form by writing to: Vaccine Damage Payments Unit Department of Social SecurityPalatine HouseLancaster RoadPrestonPR1 1HB I 9.5 The decision making process Decisions on claims are made by the Secretary of State for Social Security on the basis of a medical officer's assessment of the percentage level ofdisablement and whether it is the result of the immunisation. If a claim ismedically disallowed the claimant may, at any time, seek a review of themedical officer's assessments by an independent Vaccine Damage Tribunal. I 9.6 Further information The Benefits Agency have produced leaflet HB3 'Payment for people severely disabled by a vaccine' about the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme. Copiesare available from BA Distribution and Storage Centre, Manchester Road,Lancashire, OL10 2PZ or the Vaccine Damage Payments Unit.9 Vaccine Damage Payments SchemeVaccine Damage Payments Scheme 36 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseAnaphylaxisI10.1 Recipients of any vaccine should be observed for an immediate adverse reaction and should remain under observation until they have beenseen to be in good health and not to be experiencing an immediate adversereaction. As vaccines are administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly, thetime of onset of anaphylaxis is variable and onset may be delayed for up to 72hours. Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they developearly symptoms such as breathlessness, swelling and rash. Parents should beadvised to seek medical advice should unexpected symptoms develop afterimmunisation. All cases of anaphylaxis should be reported using the YellowCard scheme. I 10.2 Clinical Characteristics of anaphylaxis: Anaphylaxis is typically rapid and unpredictable with variable severity and clinical features. The most serious features include cardiovascular collapse,bronchospasm, angioedema, pulmonary oedema, loss of consciousness andurticaria. Asthmatic patients often develop bronchospasm during anaphylaxis.Anaphylaxis generally responds promptly to parenteral adrenaline. I10.3 In the three year period from June 1992, there were 87 spontaneous reports in people of all ages through the Yellow Card scheme ofall types of anaphylaxis, following immunisation (excluding MR vaccinewhich is considered separately below) received by the MCA. No deaths werereported. In that time, over 55 million doses of vaccines were supplied tohospitals and GPs. I10.4 During the national Measles and Rubella Immunisation Campaign in November 1994, approximately 8 million children between the ages of 5and 16 years (up to 18 years in Scotland) were immunised. 81 cases ofanaphylaxis were reported; a reporting rate of approximately one in 100,000children. There was a slight preponderance in children aged 9 years and olderand in females. All children with anaphylaxis, for whom there is informationavailable, appear to have made a full recovery. I10.5 Anaphylactic reactions to vaccines are therefore probably very rare, but they cannot be predicted and have the potential to be fatal. Mostanaphylactic reactions occur in individuals who have no known risk factors,making it difficult to advise on special precautions. It is uncertain whether ahistory of hypersensitivity significantly increases the risk of anaphylaxis.10 Anaphylaxis Immunisation against Infectious Disease 37I10.6 Management Differential Diagnosis: Findings from the Measles/Rubella Immunisation Campaign of November 1994 suggest that medical and nursing staff can havedifficulty distinguishing between anaphylactic reactions, convulsions andfainting. It is important that health professionals involved inimmunisation are able to distinguish these conditions. Most convulsionsreported after measles and rubella vaccine occurred within one hour ofimmunisation and had features suggesting syncope rather than epilepticfits. Syncope occurs commonly after any injection such as animmunisation in adults and adolescents. Very young children rarelyfaint and sudden loss of consciousness at this age should be presumed to be anaphylaxis if a central pulse (such as the carotid) cannot be felt.A central pulse is maintained during a faint or convulsion. I10.6.2 Anaphylaxis can occur without warning. Therefore, adrenaline and an appropriate sized oral airway must always beimmediately available whenever immunisation is given. All healthprofessionals responsible for immunisation must be familiar withtechniques for resuscitation of a patient with anaphylaxis to preventdisability and loss of life.10 AnaphylaxisAnaphylaxis 38 Immunisation against Infectious Disease 39general signs: sweating, nausea, dizziness, ringing in the ears, dimmed vision, weakness, may precede the event.choking and difficulty breathing may lead to hyperventilation, paraesthesiae and spasms of the hands cardiovascular: hypotension bradycardia neurological: transient jerking movements and eye rolling can occur rarely. There should be rapid recovery. Although symptoms of malaise may persist, the patient should regain consciousness in 1-2 minutes. Anyabnormal cardiovascular signs usually revert within a few minutes. VERY YOUNG CHILDREN RARELY FAINT AND SUDDEN LOSS OF CONSIOUSNESS AT THIS AGE SHOULD BE PRESUMED TO BEANAPHYLAXIS IN THE ABSENCE OF A STRONG CENTRAL (CAROTID)PULSE, WHICH PERSISTS DURING A FAINT OR CONVULSION.

Stratton K R et alNational Academy Press, Washington DC 199410 Anaphylaxis Immunisation against Infectious Disease 43Immunisation Schedule I11.1 The schedule for primary immunisation with DPT and Hib and polio starts at two months, with an interval of one month between each dose1. This allows completion of the primary course at an early age, which provides the earliest possibleprotection against whooping cough and Hib which are most dangerous for the veryyoung. No booster dose of pertussis vaccine or Hib is currently recommended; thefourth DT and polio booster continues to be given before school entry. I11.2 This accelerated schedule was adopted following recognition that one of the most frequent reasons for low vaccine uptake was the mobility of young familieswho move out of districts before their children had completed primary courses. Thisproblem was compounded by the variation in schedules between Health Authorities.The schedule at two, three and four months removes this problem by providinguniformity; starting the programme early, and having short intervals reduces theopportunities for failing to complete a course. I11.3 Studies comparing the antibody levels of diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus and poliomyelitis one year after the third dose showed adequate levels ofantibodies for both accelerated and extended schedules. I11.4 Studies undertaken to monitor adverse events associated with the accelerated schedule have shown that there are fewer adverse events whencompared to the former extended schedule. I11.5 Every effort should be made to ensure that all children are immunised even if they are older than the recommended age-range; no opportunity to immuniseshould be missed . The number of doses needed for Hib depends on the child's age (see 15.3). Hib vaccine is not recommended for those over four years. I11.6 When such opportunistic immunisation has been carried out, it must be reported to the Health Authority (HA), NHS Trust or Health Board as anunscheduled immunisation. I11.7 If any course of immunisation is interrupted, it should be resumed and completed as soon as possible . I11.8 The schedule for routine immunisation is given below. Details of the procedure for each vaccine are given in the relevant chapters and should be consulted. 11 Immunisation Schedule Immunisation against Infectious Disease 451 In some parts of Scotland, the schedule is started at two months and should be completed by six months, with intervals between injections of not less than one month.Children should therefore have received the following vaccines: By 6 months: 3 doses of DTP, Hib and polio.By 15 months: measles/mumps/rubella.By school entry: 4th DT and polio; second dose measles/mumps/rubella.

TheApproved Code of Practice entitled 'Control of Biological Agents' givespractical advice on this matter. In particular, the assessment is intendedto reveal what control measures are required to prevent or controlexposure to infection. Where a risk of infection is recognised and whereeffective vaccines are available, the employer should make those vaccinesavailable to staff who are not already immune, if they are exposed orliable to be exposed in the course of their work. Staff should be madefully aware of the benefits and drawbacks of immunisation. The Healthand Safety at Work etc Act 1974 provides for immunisation to beoffered free of charge to workers. An immunisation record should bekept which should be made available to the person in question, onrequest. I12.1.2 All local laboratory safety policies should include an immunisation policy. Arrangements for the administration ofrecommended vaccines will vary between laboratories. In most cases theservice will be provided by the local Occupational Health Department. I12.1.3 Laboratory Directors should ensure that arrangements are in place so that all staff are aware of the immunisation policy and can beoffered all vaccines recommended under the policy. Laboratory Directorsshould review the immunisation status of their staff. Where a memberof staff does not wish to accept the offer of a recommended vaccine, ordoes not respond to a vaccine, the Director together with the localOccupational Health Physician should carry out a risk assessment todetermine the likelihood of infection for the individual member of staffand his/her colleagues. If the risk is unacceptable, efforts should bemade to seek alternative employment within the laboratory for themember of staff. I 12.2 Risks of infection in laboratory workers I12.2.1 Several surveys of infections in British laboratory workers have been carried out. The risk of occupationally-acquired infection isgreatest among medical laboratory scientific officers. Risks are decliningamong all categories of staff. For example, four cases of pulmonarytuberculosis were reported among Public Health Laboratory Service staffin 1971, at a rate of 97.2 per 100,000 person years, six times the ratefor the general population. Three of the four cases were in medical12 Immunisation of Laboratory Staff Immunisation against Infectious Disease 49laboratory scientific officers. By comparison, only one case of tuberculosis (probably not occupationally acquired) was reported in anyBritish microbiology laboratory worker between 1988 and 1989. Therisk of laboratory-acquired hepatitis B has shown a similar decline. Noneof the other infections reported in the 1988-89 survey were potentiallypreventable by immunisation. I12.2.2 Two general categories of occupational risk in laboratory staff may be recognised: High risk. Those who regularly handle pathogens or potentially infected specimens, or who have regular patient contact(e.g. medical laboratory scientific officers, laboratory technicians,cleaners, porters, medical and non-medical microbiologists).Secretaries and receptionists in laboratories may be at high risk ifthey handle specimens). Low risk. Those who do not regularly handle pathogens or potentially infected specimens and do not have regular patient contact. I12.3 Indications for immunisation of laboratory staff I12.3.1 The most effective method for preventing laboratory acquired-infections is by adoption of safe working practices.Immunisation should never be regarded as a substitute for goodlaboratory practice, although it provides additional protection. I12.3.2 Indications for immunisation of laboratory staff are listed below. Guidance on contraindications to immunisation, vaccineschedules, routes of administration, sources of vaccines, vaccine storageand the management of anaphylaxis are contained in this document.Only the nationally recommended schedules should be used whenimmunising laboratory staff. I12.3.3 COSHH Regulations require that a risk assessment be carried out to determine which pathogens staff may be exposed to. Thisassessment should take into account the local epidemiology of thedisease, the nature of material handled (clinical specimens, cultures ofpathogens or both), the frequency of contact with infected or potentiallyinfected material, the laboratory facilities including containmentmeasures and the nature and frequency of any patient contact. Staffconsidered to be at risk of exposure to pathogens should be offeredroutine pre-exposure immunisation as appropriate. This decision shouldalso take into account the safety and efficacy of available vaccines. Staff12 Immunisation of Laboratory StaffImmunisation Of Laboratory Staff 50 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseImmunisation Of Laboratory Staffnot considered to be at risk need not routinely be offered immunisation,although post-exposure prophylaxis may occasionally be indicated. Itshould be noted that secretaries and receptionists are likely to be includedin the group of staff at risk. The records of risk assessments should bekept by the laboratory director or his/her designated deputy. I 12.4 Immunisation of a laboratory employee may be indicated for a number of reasons: I12.4.1 To protect the individual from an occupational risk. There are several vaccine-preventable infections that staff may be exposed to in the course of their work. Staff who work mainly with clinicalspecimens or have patient contact may be exposed to a variety ofinfections, including hepatitis B, typhoid, tuberculosis and vaccine strainsof polio virus. Staff who work mainly with pathogens are only likely tobe exposed to the specific pathogens handled in their laboratory. I12.4.2 To protect other laboratory staff and any others (eg family members) to whom a laboratory acquired infection may be secondarilytransmitted. Transmission of certain infections in the workplace may beassociated with significant morbidity. In this situation it is desirable toensure that all susceptible staff are protected. The most importantvaccine-preventable infection in this category is rubella, however othervaccines (e.g. influenza) might occasionally be indicated in certaincircumstances, such as an expected severe epidemic. I12.4.3 For staff who have not received generally recommended vaccines. The workplace provides an opportunity to identify and protect individuals who have not received immunisations such as tetanus andpolio that are recommended for the entire population.12 Immunisation of Laboratory Staff Immunisation against Infectious Disease 51Indication for Specific Vaccines I12.5 Anthrax (Chapter 13) I12.5.1 The probability that clinical specimens and environmental samples of UK origin contain B. anthracis and present any risk to staff is extremely low, and thus routine immunisation of laboratory workers is notindicated. Staff for whom the vaccine is indicated include: (i). Those who work with the organism.(ii). Those who have direct contact with imported animal products likely to contact the organism. I12.5.2 Specific queries about anthrax immunisation and side effects may be addressed to the Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research,Porton Down, (telephone 01980 612429). I12.6 BCG (Chapter 32) I12.6.1 Before starting employment all staff who handle material likely to contain tubercle bacilli such as sputum should be checked forevidence of a BCG scar. If they have a scar, they do not require BCG. Ifthey have no scar, they should have a Heaf or Mantoux test. Those witha negative reaction (Heaf grade 0 or 1) should be offered BCGimmunisation and the immunisation site should be checked 6 weeks later.Those with a moderate reaction (Heaf grade 2) do not require BCG.Those with a strong reaction (Heaf grade 3 or 4) should be questionedabout symptoms suggestive of TB. If symptoms suggest it, or if theworker comes from a country where tuberculosis is common, theyshould be referred to the local chest physician, either through theoccupational health department or their general practitioner, for fullinvestigation and follow-up. Tuberculin positivity takes up to following BCG immunisation, and recently immunised staffshould not be allowed to handle material such as sputum likely tocontain tubercle bacilli during this period. I12.6.2 Anyone likely to come in contact with material containing tubercle bacilli who is found to be susceptible and refuses BCG shouldhave the risks explained and both this and the refusal recorded in theiroccupational health record. I12.6.3 Pre-employment and in-service chest X rays are no longer routinely recommended for health care workers.12 Immunisation of Laboratory StaffImmunisation Of Laboratory Staff 52 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseImmunisation Of Laboratory StaffI12.7 Cholera (Chapter 14) The probability that faecal material will contain V. cholerae 01 or 0139 is low, and the infective dose required is high (109organisms). The risk of laboratory-acquired infection is therefore negligible. In addition, the efficacy ofthe currently available vaccine is low (40-50%). For these reasons, routineimmunisation of laboratory staff is not indicated. Staff in referencelaboratories who work with the organism may however be at higher risk and arisk assessment should be carried out of the activities in which individuals areinvolved to determine the need for immunisation. I12.8 Diphtheria (Chapter 15) I12.8.1 Laboratory-acquired diphtheria has been reported in the UK. Staff who handle clinical material that may contain pathogeniccorynebacteria, or who work with the organism or who may come intocontact with infected patients should be considered for a booster or forprimary immunisation following a risk assessment. Staff for whomimmunisation is likely to be appropriate include those in referencelaboratories or who handle control strains. I12.8.2 Low dose (adult type) vaccine should be used either as a single antigen preparation (d), or in combination with tetanus toxoid(Td). Td is contraindicated in those with a history of a severe reactionto tetanus toxoid. A full primary course should be given (if previouslyunimmunised) or a booster dose (if previously immunised). If the adultsingle antigen diphtheria vaccine is not available, one fifth dose of thepaediatric vaccine may be used instead. Immunity to diphtheria shouldbe checked at least three months after immunisation is completed bymeasuring antitoxin levels in serum. Immunity testing should be carriedout using the Vero cell toxin neutralisation assay at the Respiratory andSystemic Infection Laboratory. Further booster doses should be offeredat ten yearly intervals. Staff considered to require immunisation with ahistory of a booster dose in the past 10 years should be tested, boosted ifnon-immune, then tested post immunisation. Staff with no history of abooster dose in the past 10 years should be boosted without pre-immunisation testing, then tested post immunisation. The cut off levelfor immunity should be 0.01 iu/Ml with the exception of those regularlyhandling toxigenic strains, in whom it should be 0.1 iu/Ml. Staffconsidered to require immunisation who have been previously tested byELISA should now be retested by neutralisation assay.12 Immunisation of Laboratory Staff Immunisation against Infectious Disease 53I12.9 Hepatitis A (Chapter 17) I12.9.1 Although it is likely that many laboratory workers are exposed to material that contains hepatitis A virus, there is little evidenceof an occupational risk. There are two groups who may be at higherrisk, to whom immunisation should be offered: (i). Those attempting to culture the virus.(ii). Those who travel regularly to endemic areas in the course of their work or who travel for periods greater than three months. Forother categories of travellers, human normal immunoglobulin (HNIG)is an inexpensive alternative to vaccine, offering short term protection. I12.9.2 Testing for antibodies (IgG) to hepatitis A virus prior to immunisation may be worthwhile in those aged fifty years or over, thoseborn in areas of high or moderate endemicity and those who have ahistory of jaundice. There is no evidence that staff performing routinehepatitis A serology tests are at particular risk. I12.10 Hepatitis B (Chapter 18) I12.10.1 Hepatitis B immunisation should be offered to all staff who handle material that may contain the virus (blood, blood-stained bodyfluids and patients' tissues). Post-immunisation antibody testing shouldbe carried out two to four months after completing the primary course.Poor responders (anti-HBs = 10-100 miu/ml) and non responders (anti-HBs < l0miu/ml) should be offered a further dose of vaccine. Vaccine non-responders should, with their consent, be tested for serological markers ofpast and current HBV infection. Vaccine non-responders without markersof previous infection may be at risk of acquiring HBV; their practicehowever need not be restricted provided that occupational exposures arepromptly reported and managed according to existing guidance. I12.10.2 Staff at continuing risk of exposure should be offered a booster dose at five-yearly intervals.12 Immunisation of Laboratory StaffImmunisation Of Laboratory Staff 54 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseImmunisation Of Laboratory StaffI12.11 Influenza (Chapter 20) There is little evidence that annual influenza immunisation of healthy adults reduces sickness absence from work and it is not indicated for laboratory staffexcept in those working with the virus. For those in non-occupational riskgroups for whom annual immunisation is recommended as part of nationalpolicy (e.g. those with chronic diseases), it would normally be offered by theGP. This policy would be reviewed in the event of a major epidemic. I12.12 Japanese encephalitis (Chapter 21) Immunisation is indicated for two groups: (i). Those who work with the virus.(ii). Those travelling in the course of their work to infected areas of South East Asia and the Far East who will be staying in ruralareas for more than one month. I12.13 Meningococcal disease (Chapter 23) The majority of strains of N. meningitidis encountered in the laboratory will be group B, for which no vaccine is available. Protection against thevaccine-preventable strains (A and C) with the currently-available vaccine isshort-lived. For these reasons, routine immunisation of laboratory staff isnot indicated. Staff in reference laboratories who work with the organismmay however be at higher risk and a risk assessment should be carried out todetermine the need for immunisation. Consideration should also be givento the need to protect staff in the field investigating outbreaks where considerableexposure to N. meningitidis may be experienced in the course of taking throat swabs. I12.14 Poliomyelitis (Chapter 26) No adult should remain unimmunised against polio. All staff should have their polio immunisation history checked on commencing employment andoffered a primary course if necessary. Staff likely to be exposed to polioviruses should be offered a booster every ten years. This will include staff whohandle material such as faeces that may contain polio viruses. A booster doseshould also be given to any member of staff travelling on business to a countrywhere polio still occurs, if more than ten years have elapsed since the last dose.12 Immunisation of Laboratory Staff Immunisation against Infectious Disease 55I12.15 Rabies (Chapter 27) Pre-exposure immunisation is indicated for three groups: (i). Those who work with the virus.(ii). Those who work with recently imported primates and other animals that may be infected. (iii). Those working in rural areas of countries where rabies is endemic. I12.16 Rubella (Chapter 28) Rubella is a potential risk to pregnant women and currently occurs predominantly in young males. Less than 2 % of females and less than 10 %of males are susceptible. Hence, documented evidence of rubella immunisationshould be asked for in all new members of staff. If there are no documents,they should be offered to have their rubella status checked and immunised iffound to have inadequate antibody levels. I12.17 Smallpox (Chapter 29) I12.17.1 Although a number of laboratory staff work with recombinant vaccinia virus, vaccination of such laboratory workers is nolonger routinely recommended. I12.17.2 Where a Laboratory Director considers that there may be a special case for vaccination of a particular member of staff, the caseshould be discussed with the Director, Public Health Laboratory Service,Virus Reference Division, 61 Colindale Avenue, Colindale, London NW95HT (Tel. 0181-200 4400) or Scottish andEnvironmental Health (SCIEH) (Tel. 0141 946 7120). I12.18 Tetanus (Chapter 30) I12.18.1 All staff should have their tetanus immunisation history checked on commencing employment and offered a primary course iffound to be unimmunised. In assessing the likelihood that an individualhas been previously immunised against tetanus, the following pointsshould be borne in mind:12 Immunisation of Laboratory StaffImmunisation Of Laboratory Staff 56 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseImmunisation Of Laboratory Staff(i). Routine use of tetanus toxoid in the British army began in 1938. (ii). Routine tetanus immunisation of infants began in 1961.(iii). Routine use of tetanus toxoid in wound prophylaxis began in 1970.I12.18.2 Regular booster doses are not indicated, although post-exposure prophylaxis may be necessary at the time of injury. Any adult who hasreceived five doses of vaccine is likely to have lifelong immunity. Furtherdoses may provoke hypersensitivity reactions and are not indicated. I12.19 Tick borne encephalitis (Chapter 31) Immunisation is indicated for two groups: (i). Those who work with the virus.(ii). Those travelling in the course of their work to infected areas of Central and Eastern Europe where prolonged exposure is likely. I12.20 Typhoid (Chapter 33) I12.20.1 Approximately 200 cases of typhoid are reported each year in the UK, thus it is likely that many workers in microbiological laboratorieswill be exposed to the organism at some time. The risk of exposure mayvary in different parts of the country. I12.20.2 Typhoid vaccine offers suboptimal protection (approximately 70%) and regular boosters are required. It is recommended that all staff whomay handle faeces, or who work with the organism, should be immunised.The subunit (Typhim Vi) vaccine is likely to cause fewer local and systemicreactions. I12.21 Yellow Fever (Chapter 35) Immunisation is indicated for two groups: (i). Those who work with the virus or handle material from suspected cases. (ii). Those travelling in the course of their work to infected areas of Africa or South America.12 Immunisation of Laboratory Staff Immunisation against Infectious Disease 57I12.22 Bibliography Health and Safety Commission's Health Services Advisory Committee.

Anthrax is primarily a disease of herbivorous animals but allmammals may be susceptible to infection. Spores can be found in animal productssuch as wool, hair, hides, skins, bones, bonemeal, and in the carcasses of infectedanimals. The spores can also contaminate soil. Spores may survive for many years.New areas of infection may develop through the use of infected animal feed. In theUK human anthrax is rare, and is almost entirely an occupational disease affectingworkers handling infected animals (abattoir workers) or exposed to importedinfected animal products. Prevention depends on, for example, controlling anthraxin livestock and on disinfecting imported animal products. Processing of hides,wool and bone by tanning, dyeing, carbonising or acid treatment also provides ameans to control the risk of infection. Bonemeal used as horticultural fertilisermay rarely contain anthrax spores if it has not been correctly treated (e.g. by steamsterilisation) in the country of origin; a certificate of sterilisation should accompanyany consignment on entry to the UK. Those handling it in bulk should wearimpervious gloves which should be destroyed after use. I 13.2 Vaccine Human anthrax vaccine is the alum precipitate of the antigen found in the sterile filtrate from cultures of the Sterne strain of Bacillus anthracis , preserved with thiomersal. It creates protective immunity to the toxin produced by thebacillus. The vaccine must be kept at 2-8\u00b0C and should be well shaken beforebeing given by intramuscular injection. Freezing must be avoided. I 13.3 Recommendations I13.3.1 Immunisation against anthrax is recommended only for workers at risk of exposure to the disease (13.1). I13.3.2 Workers at risk should receive information, instruction and training on the nature of anthrax including its mode of transmission andhow to recognise early symptoms of the disease. Good hygiene practice,i.e. regular handwashing, avoidance of hand to eye/mouth contact andcovering cuts and abrasions before working, should be demonstrated.Suitable protective clothing should be worn. Adequate washing facilitiesshould be provided. Where appropriate, industry/engineering controls,e.g. enclosure of dusty processes and exhaust ventilation, should beemployed with procedures for regular workplace cleaning and disinfection. 13 Anthrax Immunisation against Infectious Disease 61I13.4 Route of administration and dosage I13.4.1 Four injections of 0.5ml should be given intramuscularly, with intervals of three weeks between the first three injections and sixmonths between the third and fourth. Annual reinforcing doses of 0.5mlintramuscularly are advised. The batch number of the vaccine should berecorded in the recipient's records. I13.4.2 Advice on the use of anthrax vaccine can be obtained from the Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research (Tel. 01980 612100). I 13.5 Adverse reactions I13.5.1 Reports of adverse reactions to anthrax vaccine are very rare. Mild erythema and swelling lasting up to two days may occur at the siteof the injection. Occasionally regional lymphadenopathy, mild fever andurticaria may develop. I13.5.2 Severe reactions should be reported to the Committee on Safety of Medicines through the Medicines Control Agency using theyellow card system. I 13.6 Contraindications There are no specific contraindications. A local or general reaction to the first injection does not necessarily indicate a predisposition to reactions followingsubsequent injections. I13.7 Management of outbreaks All cases of anthrax should be notified. An attempt should be made to confirm the diagnosis bacteriologically and the source of infection should beinvestigated. Penicillin is the treatment of choice. Skin lesions should becovered; any discharge or soiled articles should be disinfected. Anthrax vaccinehas no role in the management of a case or outbreak.

The illness is characterised by the sudden onset of profuse,watery stools with occasional vomiting. Dehydration, metabolic acidosisand circulatory collapse may follow rapidly. Untreated, over 50% of themost severe cases die within a few hours of onset; with prompt, correcttreatment, mortality is less than 1%. Mild cases with only moderatediarrhoea also occur and asymptomatic infection is common. Theincubation period is usually between two and five days but may be onlya few hours. I14.1.2 The disease is mainly water-borne and acquired by the ingestion of contaminated water, shellfish or other food, but person-to-person spread may also occur. Even in infected areas the risk totravellers is very small. I14.1.3 Cholera due to the classical biotype of V. cholerae was endemic in the Ganges Delta of West Bengal and Bangladesh during thelast two centuries and caused epidemics and global pandemics. Theseventh global pandemic which started in 1961 is due to the El Torbiotype and is now widespread in the Far East, Africa and central SouthAmerica. A new type (0139) producing similar symptoms has beenidentified in India, Bangladesh and Thailand. I14.1.4 The last indigenous case of cholera in England and Wales was reported in 1893. Occasional imported cases occur, but the risk ofan outbreak is very small in countries with modern sanitation and watersupplies and high standards of food hygiene. I14.1.5 Prevention of cholera depends primarily on improving sanitation and water supplies in endemic areas and on scrupulouspersonal and food and water hygiene. Cholera vaccine gives onlylimited personal protection and does not prevent spread of the disease.The World Health Organisation (WHO) therefore no longerrecommends use of the vaccine, and immunisation against cholera is nolonger an official requirement for entry into any foreign country.14 Cholera Immunisation against Infectious Disease 65I14.2 Vaccine No cholera vaccine is currently available in the UK. I14.3 Recommendations Cholera vaccine should not be required of any traveller . Officials at a few remote borders may occasionally ask people travelling from infected areas forevidence of immunisation. Travellers who are likely to cross such borders,especially overland, should be advised to carry a signed statement on officialpaper that cholera vaccine is not indicated (see Health Information forOverseas Travel). I 14.4 Managements of outbreaks Cholera vaccine has no role in the management of contacts of any cases, or in controlling the spread of infection. Control of the disease depends on publichealth measures rather than immunisation. Suspected cases should be notifiedto the CCDC or CAMO immediately. Sources of infection should beidentified and treated appropriately. Contacts should maintain high standardsof personal hygiene to avoid becoming infected. I 14.5 Bibliography International Travel and Health 1995. World Health Organisation, Geneva.14 CholeraCholera 66 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseNOTIFIABLEDiphtheriaI15.1 Introduction I15.1.1 Diphtheria is an acute infectious disease affecting the upper respiratory tract and occasionally the skin. It is characterised by aninflammatory exudate which forms a greyish membrane in therespiratory tract which may cause respiratory obstruction. Theincubation period is from two to five days. Patients with disease may beinfectious for up to four weeks, but carriers may shed Corynebacteria diphtheriae for longer. A toxin is produced by diphtheria bacilli which affects particularly myocardium and nervous and adrenal tissues. Spreadis by droplet infection and through contact with articles soiled byinfected persons (fomites). In countries where hygiene is poor, cutaneousdiphtheria is the predominant source of infection. I15.1.2 Effective protection against the disease is provided by active immunisation. The introduction of immunisation against diphtheria ona national scale in 1940 resulted in a dramatic fall in the number ofnotified cases and deaths from the disease. In 1940, 46,281 cases with2,480 deaths were notified, compared with 37 cases and six deaths in1957. From 1986 to 1995, 38 isolates of toxigenic C. diphtheriae were identified by the PHLS Diphtheria Reference Unit. Of these, 19 werecarriers and 7 were cutaneous infections. There was one death in 1994:a 14 year old with no record of immunisation who had visited Pakistan.15 Diphtheria Immunisation against Infectious Disease 6715 DiphtheriaDiphtheria 68 Immunisation against Infectious Disease 0200004000060000 60 40 20 0 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 YearsNotifications ThousandsNotifications of diptheria to ONS England and Wales (1940-1995)DiphtheriaI15.1.3 The increase in notifications of diphtheria since 1992 has been due to a rise in isolations of a non-toxigenic C. diphtheriae var gravis . Presentation is usually with a sore throat without signs of toxicity. I15.1.4 Since 1991, there has been an epidemic of diphtheria in Russia, now involving other Newly Independent States of the formerSoviet Union. In 1995, approximately 52,000 cases of diphtheria and1,700 deaths were reported. The causes of this epidemic are lowimmunisation coverage in young children, waning immunity in adultsand large scale population movements. There have been someimportations from the former Soviet Union countries into neighbouringcountries but no evidence of importation into the UK. I15.1.5 The disease and the organism have been virtually eliminated from the United Kingdom; the few cases which have occurred in recentyears have nearly all been imported from the Indian subcontinent orfrom Africa, with minimal spread. There is thus no possibility now ofacquiring natural immunisation from sub-clinical infection. Highimmunisation uptake must be maintained in order to protect thepopulation against the possibility of a resurgence of the disease whichcould follow the introduction of cases or carriers of toxigenic strainsfrom overseas. I15.1.6 Recent published data indicate that approximately 38% of UK blood donors are susceptible to diphtheria. A significant trend ofdecreasing immunity with increasing age was apparent: 25% of donorsaged 20-29 were susceptible compared with 53% of those aged 50-59. I 15.2 Diphtheria vaccine I15.2.1 Diphtheria immunisation protects by stimulating the production of antitoxin which provides immunity to the effects of thetoxin. The immunogen is prepared by treating a cell-free purifiedpreparation of toxin with formaldehyde, thereby converting it into theinnocuous diphtheria toxoid. This however is a relatively poorimmunogen, and for use as a vaccine it is usually adsorbed on to anadjuvant, either aluminium phosphate or aluminium hydroxide.Bordetella pertussis also acts as an effective adjuvant. 15 Diphtheria Immunisation against Infectious Disease 69I15.2.2 The dose diphtheria vaccine for adults (d). Adsorbed tetanus/low dose diphtheria vaccine for adults (Td). The dose is 0.5ml given by intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injection. Plain vaccines are less immunogenic and have no advantage in terms of reaction rates and are no longer available. Vaccines should be stored at 2-8\u00b0C and protected from light. Vaccine which has been frozen should not be used. Disposal should be byincineration at a temperature not less than 1100\u00b0C at a registered wastedisposal contractor. I 15.3 Recommendations I15.3.1 For immunisation of infants and children up to ten years of age. a. Primary immunisationDiphtheria vaccine as a component of triple vaccine (diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid and Bordetella pertussis toxoid) is recommended forinfants from two months of age. Adsorbed vaccine should be used as ithas been shown to cause fewer reactions than plain vaccine which is nolonger available. If the pertussis component is contraindicated,adsorbed diphtheria/tetanus vaccine should be used. A course of primary immunisation consists of three doses starting at two monthswith an interval of one month between each dose (see 11.1). If a course is interrupted it may be resumed; there is no need to start again. b. Reinforcing immunisationBooster doses of vaccine containing diphtheria and tetanus toxoids are recommended for: (i) children before school entry - DT, preferably atleast three years after the last dose of the primary course, and (ii) beforeleaving school at 13 to 18 years of age - Td, both at the same time asOPV. 15 DiphtheriaDiphtheria 70 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseDiphtheriaIn approximately 25% of children, a fifth tetanus vaccine dose is said to have been given by the time the school leaving booster (Td) is due. If achild requires a tetanus booster after a tetanus prone wound, after the fourth dose has been given (at around 4 years of age) and ten years has elapsed, then Td should be given. The school leaving Td dose is then notnecessary. If there is a documented history of a fifth dose of tetanus vaccine having already been given when the school leaving booster is due, andsupplies of a low dose diphtheria vaccine product are readily available (either lowdose diphtheria vaccine (d) or 0.1 ml of paediatric strength diphtheriavaccine (D)), then one of these latter two products should be used. Ifneither is available, then Td should be given with an interval of at leastone month since the last dose of tetanus vaccine. Recent experience hasshown that when Td is given to children who have already had 5 dosesof tetanus vaccine, there is some increase in the number who have localreactions and low grade pyrexias, but no increase in the numbers withpyrexias over 38.5\u00b0C I15.3.2 Immunisation of persons aged ten years or over a. Primary immunisationLow dose diphtheria vaccine for adults (d) must be used because of the possibility of a reaction in an individual who is already immune. Past experience showed that when full strength diphtheria vaccinepreparations (D) were given to adults, there were considerably morelocalised and generalised reactions, such as high fever. Three doses(0.5ml) of low dose vaccine for adults (d) should be given by deepsubcutaneous or intramuscular injection at intervals of one month. Whenthis product is not available, then a 0.1 ml injection of the standardpaediatric diphtheria vaccine (D) may be given as an alternative. Foradults who have never received either diphtheria or tetanus vaccinepreviously, three doses of Td should be used, each given one month apart. b. Reinforcing immunisationA single dose of 0.5ml of low-dose diphtheria vaccine (d) must be used for all persons aged ten years and over. When this product is not available, then a 0.1 ml injection of the standard paediatric diphtheriavaccine (D) may be given as an alternative. When a reinforcing dose oftetanus vaccine is also required, then Td should be used. Prior Schicktesting is not necessary and the material is no longer available.15 Diphtheria Immunisation against Infectious Disease 71I15.3.3 Children given DTP at monthly intervals without a booster dose at 18 months have been shown to have adequate levels ofdiphtheria and tetanus antibody at school entry. A booster dose at 18months for such children is therefore not necessary. I15.3.4 Travel: Primary or reinforcing doses are recommended for travellers to epidemic or endemic areas (see 'Health Information forOverseas Travel' for more information). I15.3.5 Contacts of a diphtheria case, or carriers of a toxigenic strain Individuals exposed to such a risk should be given a complete course or a reinforcing dose according to their age and immunisation history asfollows: a. Immunised children up to ten years. One injection of diphtheria vaccine (D). b.Immunised children ten years and over, and adults. One injection of low dose diphtheria vaccine for adults (d or Td). c. Unimmunised children under ten years. Three injections of diphtheria (D) vaccine (or DTP and polio vaccines if appropriate) at monthly intervals. d. Unimmunised children ten years and over, and adults. Three injections of low dose diphtheria vaccine for adults (d) or Td atmonthly intervals. Unimmunised contacts of a case of diphtheria should in addition be given a prophylactic course of erythromycin or penicillin. Symptomaticcontacts (including close contacts) of cases of sore throat associated withnon-toxigenic C. diphtheriae should be swabbed and treated accordingly; asymptomatic contacts do not require swabbing orantibiotic prophylaxis. Contacts of cases of C. ulcerans do not require prophylaxis as human to human transmission does not occur. I15.3.6 HIV positive individuals may be immunised against diphtheria in the absence of any contraindications. 15 DiphtheriaDiphtheria 72 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseDiphtheriaI15.4 Testing for diphtheria immunity The material for carrying out the Schick test is no longer available. Individuals who may be exposed to diphtheria in the course of their work should havetheir immunity checked by antibody testing at least three months afterimmunisation is completed and boosted at ten year intervals thereafter. I 15.5 Adverse reactions I15.5.1 Swelling and redness at the injection site are common. Malaise, transient fever and headache may also occur. A small painlessnodule may form at the injection site but usually disappears withoutsequelae. Severe anaphylactic reactions are rare. Neurological reactionshave been reported occasionally. I15.5.2 Severe reactions should be reported to the Committee on Safety of Medicines using the yellow card system. I 15.6 Contraindications I15.6.1 a. If a child is suffering from any acute illness, immunisation should be postponed until the child has fully recovered. Minorinfections without fever or systemic upset are not reasons to postponeimmunisation. b. Immunisation should not proceed in children who have had a severe local or general reaction to a preceding dose (see 7.2.2), if it is thoughtthat the diphtheria component has caused the preceding reaction.Reactions to the pertussis component of DTP are the most likely andimmunisation should proceed with DT; acellular pertussis vaccine can beused if the previous reaction was a local one. I15.6.2 When there is a need to control an outbreak, diphtheria vaccine may have to be given to individuals suffering from acute febrileillness. Low-dose diphtheria vaccine for adults (d or Td) must be usedfor persons aged ten years and over.15 Diphtheria Immunisation against Infectious Disease 73I15.7 Diphtheria antitoxin Diphtheria antitoxin is now only used in suspected cases of diphtheria. Tests with a trial dose to exclude hypersensitivity should precede its use. It shouldbe given without waiting for bacteriological confirmation since its action isspecific for diphtheria. It may be given intramuscularly or intravenously, thedosage depending on the clinical condition of the patient. This is shown in thefollowing table. It is no longer used for diphtheria prophylaxis because of therisk of provoking a hypersensitivity reaction to the horse serum from which itis derived. Unimmunised contacts of a case of diphtheria should be promptlyinvestigated, kept under surveillance and given antibiotic prophylaxis andvaccine, as in 15.3.5. Table: Dosage of antitoxin recommended for various types of diphtheria If acute anaphylaxis develops, intravenous adrenaline (0.2 to 0.5ml of 1:1000 solution) should be administered immediately by intravenous injection.15 DiphtheriaDiphtheria 74 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseType of diphtheria Dosage (units) Route Nasal 10,000 - 20,000 IntramuscularTonsillar 15,000 - 25,000 Intramuscular or intravenous Pharyngeal or laryngeal 20,000 - 40,000 Intramuscular or intravenous Combined types or 40,000 - 60,000 Intravenous delayed diagnosis Severe diphtheria 40,000 - 100,000 Intravenous or part e.g. with extensive intravenous and partmembrane and/or severe intramuscularoedema (bull-neck diphtheria)DiphtheriaAntitoxin is probably of no value for cutaneous disease, although some authorities use 20,000 to 40,000 units of antitoxin because toxic sequelaehave been reported.

Invasive disease isusually caused by encapsulated strains of the organism. Six capsular serotypes(a-f) are known to cause disease in man; however, over 99% of typeable strainscausing invasive disease are type b. Non-typeable strains can occasionally causeinvasive disease. Non-encapsulated strains are mainly associated with respiratoryinfections such as exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and otitis media. I16.1.2 The most common presentation of invasive Hib disease is meningitis, frequently accompanied by bacteraemia. This presentation accountsfor approximately 60% of all cases. 15% of cases present with epiglottitis,another potentially dangerous infection. Septicaemia, without any otherconcomitant infection, occurs in 10% of cases. The remainder is made up ofcases of septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, cellulitis, pneumonia and pericarditis. Thesequelae following Hib meningitis include deafness, convulsions and intellectualimpairment. In studies conducted in Wales and Oxford, 8 to 11% hadpermanent neurological sequelae. The case fatality rate is 4 to 5%. I16.1.3 Based on the Wales and Oxford studies, the estimated annual incidence of invasive Hib disease before the introduction of immunisation,was 34 per 100,000 children under the age of 5 years, ie. one in every 600children developed some form of invasive Hib disease before their fifthbirthday. The number of laboratory reports in England and Wales increasedfrom 869 in 1983 to 1259 in 1989. I16.1.4 The disease is rare in children under 3 months of age, but rises progressively during the first year, reaching a peak incidence between 10 and11 months. Thereafter, the incidence declines steadily to 4 years of age afterwhich infection becomes uncommon. I16.1.5 Since the introduction of Hib immunisation, disease incidence has fallen dramatically. There were 39 laboratory reports of Hib infectionin England and Wales in 1995 (9 in children less than one year of age),compared with 627 (229 in children under one year) in 1992. There wasonly one death in 1995. The decline in those under 1 year, at highest risk ofinvasive disease, was 96%. Notifications of H. influenzae meningitis (all ages, England and Wales) declined from 484 to 60 in the same period, a fallof 88%. The decrease in notifications for children less than one year issimilar to that observed for laboratory reports. By March 1996, vaccinecoverage by the second birthday was 95%.16 Haemophilus Influenzae Type (Hib) Immunisation Haemophilus Influenzae Type b (Hib)Haemophilus Influenzae Type b (Hib) 78 Immunisation against Infectious Disease 250 200 150 100 50 0 YearsNumber of reports 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995Hib vaccine introduced up to 1 year of age all other ages Source: PHLS, CDSCLaboratory reports of Haemophilus influenzae type b by age England and Wales (1989-1995)Haemophilus Influenzae Type b (Hib) I16.2 Vaccine I16.2.1 Vaccines against Hib were first produced in the early 1970s. These vaccines contained purified capsular polysaccharide and wereshown to be effective in protecting children against disease. However, thevaccines were not immunogenic in children under 18 months of age, thegroup in whom the risks of disease were highest. More recently,conjugate vaccines have been developed. Here the capsularpolysaccharides have been linked to proteins, thereby improving thevaccine immunogenicity, especially in children less than one year of age.The capsular polysaccharides have been conjugated to diphtheria andtetanus toxoids, group B meningococcal outer membrane protein and anon-toxic derivative of diphtheria toxin (CRM197). I16.2.2 The efficacy and safety of the conjugate Hib vaccines have been demonstrated in large field trials in Finland, the United States and in the UK.Vaccine efficacy exceeds 95% in infants immunised from 2 months of age.Studies comparing different vaccines, using the present United Kingdomprimary schedule, have shown that 90 to 99% of children developedprotective levels of antibody, following 3 doses (personal communication). I16.2.3 Active surveillance of invasive Hib infections in fully immunised children started in September 1992 on a UK wide basis. By 1April 1995, 35 true vaccine failures had been identified. Several of thecases had underlying conditions, such as immunoglobulin deficiency, thatmay have predisposed to vaccine failure. During the period of surveillancearound seven million doses of Hib vaccine have been distributed. This isconsistent with a vaccine efficacy in excess of 95%. I16.2.4 The conjugate Hib vaccines are not live, containing non- replicating bacterial capsular antigens. I16.2.5 The vaccine should be stored between 2-8\u00b0C but not frozen. If the vaccine is frozen, it should not be used. I 16.3 Route of administration and dosage The dose of Hib vaccine is 0.5 ml. It should be given by deep subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, in a different limb from other concurrently administeredvaccines. Recording the sites of injection of concurrently administered vaccinesallows any local reactions to be attributed to the appropriate antigen or antigens.16 Haemophilus Influenzae Type b (Hib) Immunisation against Infectious Disease 79I16.4 Recommendations I16.4.1 Conjugate Hib vaccine, as a component of the primary course of childhood immunisation, is recommended for all infants from 2months of age, in the absence of a genuine contraindication. I16.4.2 The primary course consists of three doses of Hib vaccine with an interval of one month between each dose. If the primary courseis interrupted, it should be resumed allowing one month intervals betweenthe remaining doses. I16.4.3 Recent studies undertaken by the PHLS have shown that there is no loss of immunogenicity or increase in reactogenicity whenchildren are immunised with different sequences of Hib vaccines fromdifferent manufacturers. The studies compared tetanus conjugated Hibvaccine with CRM197 diphtheria mutant conjugate Hib vaccine.Children who start a course of Hib vaccine on one product can thereforehave the course completed with another product should the need arise.There is no need to recommence a course of Hib vaccine. I16.4.4 There is now sufficient evidence of preservation of immunogenicity and no increase in reactogenicity to allow recommendationfor Hib vaccines to be mixed with DTP vaccines for simultaneousadministration. Pasteur Merieux tetanus conjugate Hib vaccine (ActHib), a lyophilised powder, can be suspended with Pasteur Merieux DTP vaccine asthe diluent for immediate administration. Evans (0.5ml) can be mixedwith SKB tetanus conjugate vaccine (Hiberix). The volume of the combinedvaccine is 0.5ml and no further diluent is (0.5ml) bemixed with Lederle Praxis CRM197 mutant diphtheria vaccine (HibTITER)giving a final volume of 1.0ml for simultaneous administration. Studies haveshown that this volume of injected material is well tolerated. I16.4.5 No reinforcing (booster) doses are recommended for children who have received three injections at the appropriate times. I16.4.6 Children under the age of 13 months are at high risk of disease and should receive 3 doses of Hib vaccine, even if they have alreadycommenced or completed their immunisations against Diphtheria, Tetanus,Pertussis and Poliomyelitis. Hib vaccine can be given at the same time as anyother vaccines and any outstanding Hib doses should be given after thecompletion of the other antigens, separated by one month from the last Hibdose.16 Haemophilus Influenzae Type b (Hib)Haemophilus Influenzae Type b (Hib) against Infectious DiseaseHaemophilus Influenzae Type b (Hib) I16.4.7 Unimmunised children between 13 and 48 months should be given a single injection of Hib vaccine, either simultaneously withMMR vaccine, or singly if the MMR has already been given. Childrenin this age group are at lower risk of disease and the vaccine is effectiveafter a single dose. I16.4.8 Because the incidence of invasive disease falls sharply after 4 years, routine immunisation of older children and adults is notrecommended. I16.4.9 HIV positive individuals may receive Hib vaccine. I16.4.10 Asplenic children and adults, irrespective of age or the interval from splenectomy, should receive a single dose of Hib vaccine.There are data to suggest that a single dose of Hib vaccine isimmunogenic in splenectomised adults. Those under one year should begiven three doses. At present, there are no data to indicate a need forfurther booster doses. When splenectomy is performed electively, thevaccine should be given ideally at least two weeks earlier. I 16.5 Adverse reactions I16.5.1 Swelling and redness at the injection site have been reported at a rate of up to 10%, following the first dose. However, the size ofthese reactions was rarely sufficient to contraindicate further doses.These effects usually appear within 3 to 4 hours and resolve completelywithin 24 hours. The incidence of these reactions declines withsubsequent doses, supporting the recommendation that courses ofimmunisation should be completed despite the occurrence of suchreactions. I16.5.2 When a severe local reaction (see 7.2.2) follows the administration of combined DTP/Hib vaccines, the course should becontinued with the products given separately (DTP at one site, Hib atanother site). Should a severe generalised reaction follow theadministration of combined DTP/Hib vaccine, then Hib vaccine shouldbe given at one site and DT vaccine at another. I16.5.3 The addition of Hib vaccine to routine immunisation does not lead to an increase in the number of febrile convulsions that occur inthe 72 hours after immunisation, compared to control periods.16 Haemophilus Influenzae Type b (Hib) Immunisation against Infectious Disease 81I16.5.4 Surveillance in the UK of adverse events following Hib immunisation has not revealed any severe reactions that are not routinelyreported after either DTP vaccine or MMR, which have most often beenadministered at the same time. I 16.6 Contraindications I16.6.1 a. If the child is suffering from any acute illness, immunisation should be postponed until the child has recovered. Minor infections,without fever or systemic upset, are not reasons to postpone immunisation. b. Immunisation should not proceed in children who have had a severe local reaction or a general reaction which can be confidently related to apreceding Hib immunisation, but see 16.5.2. When Hib vaccine hasbeen given with DTP, generalised reactions are more likely to have beencaused by the pertussis component of the DTP vaccine. I16.6.2 Hib vaccine is not a live vaccine, but there is no evidence at present of its safety or lack of safety in pregnancy. I 16.7 Immunisation of cases and contacts of Hib disease I16.7.1 Household contacts of a case of invasive Hib disease have an increased risk of contracting disease themselves. Any unimmunisedhousehold contact, under 4 years of age, should receive Hib vaccine (threedoses if under 13 months, one dose if over 13 months and under 4 years).Independently of immunisation, rifampicin prophylaxis should be given tohousehold contacts. The recommended dose is 20mg/kg/day (up to amaximum of 600mg daily) once daily for fourdays. Chemoprophylaxis is not indicated for those contacts aged under 4 years who have been fullyimmunised against Hib disease. I16.7.2 The index case should also be immunised, irrespective of age. I16.7.3 When a case occurs in a playgroup, nursery or creche, the opportunity should be taken to identify and immunise any unimmunisedchildren under 4 years of age. Chemoprophylaxis should be offered to allroom contacts - teachers and children - when two or more cases of Hib disease have occurred in a playgroup, nursery or creche, within 120 days.16 Haemophilus Influenzae Type b (Hib)Haemophilus b (Hib) 82 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseHaemophilus Influenzae Type b (Hib) There is little evidence, however, that children in such settings are at significantly higher risk of Hib disease than the general population of thesame age.

Changing patterns of invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease in England and Wales after the introduction of the Hib vaccination programmeHargreaves R M et Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseNOTIFIABLEHepatitis AI17.1 Introduction I17.1.1 Hepatitis A is transmitted by the faecal-oral route. Person to person spread is the most common method of transmission althoughcontaminated food or drink may sometimes be involved. The incubationperiod is about 15-40 days and the disease is generally mild.Asymptomatic disease is common in children and severity tends toincrease with age. Occasional cases of fulminant hepatitis may occur butthere is no chronic carrier state and little likelihood of chronic liverdamage. I17.1.2 The incidence of hepatitis A shows a cyclical pattern in the UK, the most recent peak year being 1990 when 7,545 cases werereported to the Public Health Laboratory Service from England andWales. As of 30 June 1996, there were 1,750 reports in 1995. Over80% of cases are contracted in the UK and, whilst the majority of theseare sporadic, outbreaks do occur. I17.1.3 The prevalence of hepatitis A in countries outside Northern and Western Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand ishigher than in the UK. In 1995 approximately 220 (13%) of the casesnotified to PHLS included a history of travel abroad in the six weeksbefore the onset of illness. The highest risk areas are the Indiansubcontinent and the Far East, but the risk extends to Eastern Europe. I 17.2 Vaccine I17.2.1 Hepatitis A vaccine is a formaldehyde-inactivated vaccine prepared from either the GBM or the HM 175 strain of hepatitis A virus(HAV) grown in human diploid cells. It is supplied as a suspension inpre-filled syringes. I17.2.2 The vaccine should be stored at 2-8C but not frozen, and should be protected from light. It should not be diluted or mixed withother vaccines in the same syringe. I17.2.3 Immunogenicity studies show that levels of antibody produced after a primary course of vaccine administered intramuscularly17 Hepatitis A Immunisation against Infectious Disease 8517 Hepatitis AHepatitis A 86 Immunisation against Infectious Disease 8 6 4 2 0 19811982 Hepatitis A infection England and Wales (1980-1995)Hepatitis Aare well in excess of those found after the administration of HNIG. The primary course produces anti-HAV antibodies which persist for at leastone year and antibody persistence can be prolonged by administration ofa booster dose of vaccine 6 to 12 months after the initial course. I17.2.4 Human normal immunoglobulin may be administered at the same time as vaccine if protection is required less than 10 days after thefirst dose of hepatitis A vaccine. I 17.3 Recommendations I17.3.1 Travellers Protection against hepatitis A is recommended for travellers to areas of moderate or high HAV endemicity particularly if sanitation and foodhygiene are likely to be poor. Active immunisation with hepatitis Avaccine is the preferred method of protection particularly for frequenttravellers to such areas or for stays longer than three months.Immunisation is notconsidered necessary for those travelling to Northern or Western Europe (including Spain, Portugal and Italy), or toNorth America, Australia or New Zealand. When practicable, testing for antibodies to hepatitis A virus prior to immunisation may be worthwhile in those aged fifty years or over, thoseborn in areas of high or moderate hepatitis A endemicity and those whohave a history of jaundice. Similar considerations will apply to military and diplomatic personnel being posted or likely to be posted to hepatitis A virus endemiccountries. I17.3.2 Patients with chronic liver disease Although patients with chronic liver disease are at no greater risk of acquiring hepatitis A infection, it can produce a much more seriousillness in these patients who should therefore be considered forimmunisation with hepatitis A vaccine. This will include intravenousdrug misusers with chronic liver disease.17 Hepatitis A Immunisation against Infectious Disease 87I17.3.3 Haemophiliacs Transmission of hepatitis A has been associated with the use of Factor VIII and Factor IX concentrates where viral inactivation procedures donot destroy hepatitis A and it is especially important that haemophiliacsreceiving such products should be immunised against hepatitis A.Because of the high incidence of previous infections with hepatitis B andhepatitis C and of pre-existing liver disease in haemophiliacs, infectionwith hepatitis A can be particularly severe and these haemophiliacsshould also be immunised against hepatitis A. Those who areimmunosuppressed may respond less well to vaccine, and post-immunisation testing for antibody should be considered. Haemophiliacs should be immunised subcutaneously.Haemophiliacs and patients with chronic liver disease should be checked for previous exposure before immunisation I17.3.4 Occupational exposure Immunisation is recommended for laboratory workers who are working directly with the virus. There is no evidence that most health care workers are at increased risk of hepatitis A and routine immunisation is not indicated. Outbreaks of hepatitis A have been associated with residential institutions for the mentally handicapped. Transmission does occur morereadily in such institutions and immunisation of staff and residents maybe appropriate in the light of local risk assessment. Similarconsiderations apply in other institutions where standards of personalhygiene are poor. Infection in young children is likely to be sub-clinical and those working in day care centres and other settings with children who are not yettoilet-trained may be at increased risk of infection. Under normalcircumstances, the risk of transmission to staff and children can beminimised by careful attention to personal hygiene but, for example, inthe case of local community outbreaks the need for immunisation ofstaff and children should be discussed with the local Consultant inCommunicable Disease Control or in Scotland the CPHM (CD & EH).17 Hepatitis AHepatitis A 88 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseHepatitis AThere is currently not enough evidence to suggest that immunisation of all sanitation workers against hepatitis A is justified and furtherepidemiological studies are needed to establish the risks in particulargroups of workers. However raw untreated sewage is frequentlycontaminated with hepatitis A and a potential occupational risk exists inthose workers who come into direct contact with untreated sewage. TheControl of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSSH) Regulations 1994require employers to undertake their own risk assessments and to bringinto effect measures necessary to protect workers and others who maybe exposed, so far as is reasonably practicable, against those risks. Forthose at risk of exposure to untreated sewage, immunisation againsthepatitis A may be indicated as part of those measures. Food packagers or food handlers in the United Kingdom have not been associated with HAV transmission sufficiently often to justify theirimmunisation as a routine measure. I17.3.5 Homosexuals Cases of hepatitis A in homosexual males have been reported in the United Kingdom. Immunisation should be offered to those whose sexualbehaviour is likely to put them at risk. I17.3.6 Outbreaks There is evidence that the use of hepatitis A vaccine can interrupt ongoing community outbreaks of hepatitis A when given to a definedpopulation. Further guidance on the management of outbreaks shouldbe sought from the Consultant in Communicable Disease Control orfrom the PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre. In Scotlandthis should be from the CPHM (CD & EH) or from the Scottish Centrefor Infection and Environmental Health. For post exposure prophylaxisfor contacts of cases see section 17.9. I 17.4 Route of administration and dosage I17.4.1 The immunisation regimen for adults consists of a single dose of vaccine. Antibodies produced in response to this persist for atleast one year. A booster dose at 6-12 months after the initial doseresults in more persistent antibodies and a substantial increase inantibody titre and will give immunity for up to 10 years.17 Hepatitis A Immunisation against Infectious Disease 89I17.4.2 The immunisation regimen for children and adolescents up to 15 years consists of a single dose of vaccine (720 ELISA units of the HM175 strain) administered intramuscularly and produces antibodies for atleast a year. In order to obtain more persistent immunity for up to 10years a booster dose (720 ELISA units) is recommended between six andtwelve months after the primary course. The former regimen for children and adolescents up to 15 years consisted of two doses of vaccine (360 ELISA units) administeredintramuscularly two weeks to one month apart with a booster dose (360ELISA units) recommended between six to twelve months after theprimary course for prolonged immunity. Where initiated, themanufacturer recommends this regimen should be completed at thisdosage. The vaccine should be given intramuscularly in the deltoid region. It should not be given into the gluteal region because vaccine efficacy maybe reduced; nor should it be administered intravenously, or intradermallyand should not be routinely given subcutaneously, although thesubcutaneous route should be used in haemophiliacs. I17.4.3 Dosage The dose in adults (16 years and over) is 1440 ELISA units (1ml) of the HM 175 strain or 160 Antigen units (0.5ml) of the GBM strain. The dose in children/adolescents (1-15 years), in a separate presentation, is 720 ELISA units (0.5ml) of the HM175 strain. This will replace theearlier formulation where the dose was 360 ELISA units (0.5ml) (see17.4.2). I 17.5 Adverse reactions Adverse reactions are usually mild and confined to the first few days after immunisation. The most common reactions are mild transient soreness,erythema and induration at the injection site. General symptoms such as fever,malaise, fatigue, headache, nausea and loss of appetite are also reported lessfrequently. It is important that all serious adverse reactions should be reported to the Committee on Safety of Medicines by the yellow card system.17 Hepatitis AHepatitis A 90 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseHepatitis AI17.6 Contraindications Immunisation should be postponed in individuals suffering from severe febrile illness. The effect of HAV vaccine on fetal development has not been assessed. Since it is an inactivated vaccine, the risks to the fetus are likely to be negligible but,as with other vaccines in pregnancy, it should not be given unless there is adefinite risk of infection.

I17.8.2 Although infection is commonly subclinical in young children and severe infection uncommon, the decision to use HNIG may beinfluenced by the wish to protect parents and other adult contacts.Evidence suggests that, even if HNIG modifies disease rather thanpreventing infection, it is effective in preventing secondary cases. I17.8.3 There is no evidence associating the administration of intramuscular immunoglobulin with transmission of HIV. Not only doesthe processing of the plasma from which it is prepared render it safe, butthe plasma is derived from blood from donors screened for HIV,hepatitis B and hepatitis C.17 Hepatitis A Immunisation against Infectious Disease 91I17.9 Recommendations Use of HNIG should be considered in the following circumstances: a Contacts of cases of hepatitis A infectionProphylaxis restricted to household and close contacts may be relatively ineffective in controlling further spread. If given to a wider social group ofrecent household visitors (kissing contacts and those who have eaten foodprepared by the index case) spread may be more effectively prevented. b OutbreaksThe appropriate approach to prophylaxis and the use of HNIG, with or without hepatitis A vaccine, should be discussed with the Consultant inCommunicable Disease Control or CPHM (CD & EH) in Scotland. In schools , particularly nursery and primary schools, HNIG may be used to protect teachers, adult helpers, including those responsible forcleaning the toilets, and the children and parents of children in theaffected classes. In closed communities where personal hygiene may be poor, widespread use of HNIG should be considered. c TravellersHNIG is an alternative to vaccine for those travelling occasionally and for short periods to countries outside Northern and Western Europe,North America, Australia and New Zealand. Hepatitis A vaccine ispreferable for those visiting such countries frequently or staying forlonger than three months (see 17.3.1). Where practicable, testing for antibodies to hepatitis A virus prior to immunisation may be worthwhile in those aged fifty years or over, thoseborn in areas of high or moderate endemicity and those who have ahistory of jaundice. HNIG may interfere with the development of active immunity from live virus vaccines. It is therefore wise to administer live virus vaccines atleast three weeks before the administration of immunoglobulin. Ifimmunoglobulin has been administered first, then an interval of threemonths should be observed before administering a live virus vaccine.17 Hepatitis AHepatitis A 92 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseHepatitis AThis does not apply to yellow fever vaccine since HNIG does not contain antibody to this virus. For travellers, if there is insufficient time, therecommended intervals may have to be ignored, especially where poliovaccine is concerned. Alternatively, hepatitis A vaccine may be used inthese circumstances. I 17.10 Dosage At present, the dosage of HNIG is expressed either by weight (mg) or by volume (ml). 1ml of a 16% solution contains 160 mg. There are two dosagelevels. The higher dose is recommended for those at greater risk (ie contacts)and for extended protection (ie those travelling abroad for 3-5 months).

Transmission most commonly occurs following vaginal or analintercourse, as a result of blood to blood contact, including injury withcontaminated sharp instruments and sharing needles or other equipmentby intravenous drug misusers, or by perinatal transmission from mother tochild. Transmission has also rarely followed bites from infected persons.Transfusion-associated infection is now rare and adequate treatment ofblood products has eliminated these as sources of infection in this country. I18.1.2 The illness usually has an insidious onset, with anorexia, vague abdominal discomfort, nausea and vomiting, sometimes arthralgia andrash, which often progresses to jaundice. Fever may be absent or mild. Theseverity of the disease ranges from inapparent infections, which can onlybe detected by liver function tests and/or the presence of serologicalmarkers of acute HBV infection (eg HBsAg, antiHBc IgM), to fulminatingcases of acute hepatic necrosis. Among cases admitted to hospital, thefatality rate is about 1%. The average incubation period is 40-160 days. I18.1.3 About 2-10% of those infected as adults become chronic carriers of the hepatitis virus with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)persisting for longer than 6 months. Chronic carriage is more frequent inthose infected as children and rises to 90% in those infected perinatally. I18.1.4 Among carriers of the virus, those in whom hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) is detected are most infectious. Those with antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe) are generally of low infectivity. I18.1.5 20 - 25% of hepatitis B carriers worldwide develop progressive liver disease with an active hepatitis leading in some patientsto cirrhosis. The prognosis of the liver disease in such individuals is atpresent uncertain. Chronic hepatitis B carriers with liver disease are atincreased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. I18.1.6 The number of overt cases of hepatitis in the UK is low and there has been a marked decrease in recent years. Reports of acutehepatitis B to the Public Health Laboratory Service fell from a peak of justunder 2000 reports from England and Wales in 1984 to 629 reports in1994. As of 30 June 1996, there were 612 reports in 1995. About twothirds of infections are asymptomatic and may therefore not be diagnosed.18 Hepatitis B Immunisation against Infectious Disease 9518 Hepatitis B 96 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseHepatitis B 2000 1500 1000 500 PHLS, CDSCLaboratory reports of acute Hepatitis B infection England and Wales (1980-1995)Hepatitis BI18.1.7 The prevalence of surface antigenaemia is not known with certainty but recent figures suggest that it is in the order of 1 in 2500 innew blood donors. Ante-natal clinics in certain inner-city areas reporthepatitis B carriage in up to 1 in 100 women. I18.1.8 The prevalence of infection is increased among those with certain behavioural or occupational risk factors (see 18.4). The recentdecrease in reports of acute hepatitis B has been seen in most of these riskgroups. In some, such as health care workers, the decrease probablyreflects successful immunisation policy and infection control measures. Inother groups it may be linked to the modification of risk behaviours inresponse to the HIV/AIDS epidemic although the decrease has not beenapparent in men who have sex with men. Hepatitis B is the only sexually transmitted infection which may be prevented by immunisation. I18.1.9 There are two types of immunisation product; a vaccine which produces an immune response, and a specific immunoglobulin (HBIG) which provides passive immunity and can give immediate buttemporary protection after accidental inoculation or contamination withantigen positive blood. Passive immunisation with specificimmunoglobulin does not affect the development of active immunity inresponse to vaccine and combined active/passive immunisation isrecommended in certain circumstances (see 18.11) ACTIVE IMMUNISATION I18.2 Vaccine I18.2.1 Hepatitis B vaccine contains hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) adsorbed on aluminium hydroxide adjuvant. It is currentlyprepared from yeast cells using recombinant DNA technology. Theplasma-derived vaccine is no longer marketed in the UK. I18.2.2 The vaccine should be stored at 2-8\u00b0C but not frozen. Freezing destroys the potency of the vaccine. I18.2.3 The vaccine is effective in preventing infection in individuals who produce specific antibodies to the hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs). Overall, about 80-90% of individuals mount a response to thevaccine with anti-HBs levels > 10 miu/ml. Those over the age of 40 are less18 Hepatitis B Immunisation against Infectious Disease 9718 Hepatitis BHepatitis B 98 Immunisation against Infectious Diseaselikely to respond. Patients who are immunodeficient or on immunosuppressive therapy may respond less well than healthyindividuals and may require larger doses of vaccine or an additional dose. An antibody level below 10 miu/ml is classified as a non-response to the vaccine whilst an antibody level of 100 miu/ml is considered to beprotective. Those with antibody levels below 10 miu/ml two to four monthsafter completing a primary course of immunisation will require HBIG forprotection if exposed to infection (see 18.11). Poor responders (anti-HBs10-100 miu/ml) should receive a booster dose and in non-responders (anti-HBs less than 10 miu/ml) a repeat course of vaccine should be considered. Immunisation may take up to six months to confer adequate protection when the usual dose schedule is followed (see 18.5.1). Antibody titresshould be checked in health care workers and babies born to hepatitis Bcarrier mothers two to four months after completion of the course. Postimmunisation testing may also be indicated for other groups. The duration of antibody persistence is not known precisely and there is no consensus on the need for booster doses. On present evidence it is felt thata single booster dose five years after completion of a primary course issufficient to retain immunity in those who continue to be at risk ofinfection unless they have already received a booster dose followingpossible exposure to the virus (see 18.11.2). Antibody levels greater than 100 miu/ml persist in some individuals for much longer than 5 years and there is some evidence that protectiveimmunity is still present when antibody levels have fallen below 100 miu/ml. I 18.3 Recommendations I18.3.1 Immunisation is recommended in individuals who are at increased risk of hepatitis B because of their lifestyle, occupation or otherfactors such as close contact with a case or carrier (see below). In somegroups the risk is similar for all, but in other cases it will be necessary foran individual assessment of risk to be made. This is particularly the casewith those who may be at risk because of their occupation. The Controlof Substances Hazardous to Health (COSSH) Regulations 1994 requireemployers to undertake their own risk assessment and to bring into effectmeasures necessary to protect workers and others who may be exposed, asfar as is reasonably practicable, against these risks. NB. It is important that immunisation against hepatitis B does not encourage relaxation of good infection-control procedures.Hepatitis B18 Hepatitis B Immunisation against Infectious Disease 99I18.3.2 The vaccine should notbe given to individuals known to be hepatitis B surface antigen positive, or to patients with acute hepatitis B,since in the former it would be unnecessary and, in the latter, ineffective. Hepatitis B vaccine maybe given to HIV positive individuals and should be considered in those not already known to be infected or immune.Response rates are in the order of 70%. I 18.4 Risk groups Immunisation is recommended for the following groups: I18.4.1 Babies born to mothers who are chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus or to mothers who have had acute hepatitis B during pregnancy. Those providing antenatal care will need to take steps to identify infected mothers during pregnancy and make arrangements to ensurethat babies born to these mothers receive a complete course of immunisation. This is best done by screening women early in pregnancy.Where this has not been done it should be possible to detect carriermothers at the time of delivery and to provide vaccine to babies born tothese mothers within 24 hours of birth. Recent studies have shown that selective screening of ante-natal patients from groups with increased risks of having acquired hepatitis B fails toidentify some carriers. This is due not only to a failure to correctlyidentify those with established risk factors but also to the existence ofsome carriers who have no obvious risks for hepatitis B. Antenatalclinics should therefore consider offering screening to all antenatalpatients. Some clinics already do so. Babies born to mothers who are HBeAg positive, who are HBsAg positive without e markers (or where e marker status has not beendetermined), or who have had acute hepatitis during pregnancy shouldreceive HBIG as well as active immunisation (see 18.11). Hepatitis Bvaccine, but not HBIG, is recommended for babies born to mothers whoare hepatitis B surface antigen positive but known to be anti-HBepositive.18 Hepatitis BHepatitis B 100 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseBaby should receive Hepatitis B vaccine HBIG Mother is HBsAg positive and HBeAg positive + +Mother is HBsAg positive without e markers (or where they have not been determined) + + Mother had acute hepatitis B during pregnancy + +Mother is HBsAg positive and anti-HBe positive + - I18.4.2 Parenteral drug misusers I18.4.3 Individuals who change sexual partners frequently, particularly homosexual and bisexual men, and men and women who areprostitutes. Hepatitis B is the only sexually transmitted infection whichcan be prevented by immunisation. I18.4.4 Close family contacts of a case or carrier Sexual partners are most at risk but close household contacts may also be at increased risk. Contacts should have their hepatitis B markers checked to see if they have already become infected. Contacts who are HBsAg, anti-HBs oranti-HBc positive do not require immunisation but, in the case of sexualpartners, it may be unwise to delay administration of the first dose ofthe vaccine whilst awaiting test results. Advice should be given regardingthe use of condoms until immunity is established. Sexual contacts of patients with acute hepatitis B should also receive HBIG (see 18.11). I18.4.5 Families adopting children from countries with a high prevalence of hepatitis B (particularly some in Eastern Europe, SE Asia and S America) may be at risk as these children could be chroniccarriers. When the status of the child to be adopted is not known,families adopting children from any high prevalence country should beHepatitis B18 Hepatitis B Immunisation against Infectious Disease 101counselled as to the risks and offered immunisation against hepatitis B. There are grounds to consider testing such children because there couldbe benefits from referring an infected child for further management. I18.4.6 Haemophiliacs , those receiving regular blood transfusions or blood products, or those carers responsible for the administration ofsuch products. I18.4.7 Patients with chronic renal failure. The response to hepatitis B vaccine is poor in those who are immunocompromised. Only 60% ofpatients on haemodialysis develop anti-HBs and therefore, in addition tothose already on haemodialysis, the immunisation of all patients withchronic renal failure is recommended, as soon as it is anticipated they mayrequire dialysis or transplantation. A better response among patients withchronic renal failure may be obtained if higher doses of vaccine (e.g. 40 mcg)are used. I18.4.8 Health care workers including students and trainees who have direct contact with patients' blood or blood-stained body fluids orwith patients' tissues. This group will include doctors, surgeons, dentists, nurses, midwives, laboratory workers and mortuary technicians but immunisation shouldalso be considered for any other staff who are at risk of injury fromblood stained sharp instruments, contamination of surface lesions bypatients' blood or blood-stained body fluids, or of being deliberatelyinjured or bitten by patients. Advice should be obtained from theappropriate Occupational Health Department. I18.4.9 Staff and residents of residential accommodation for those with severe learning disabilities (mental handicap). A higher prevalence of hepatitis B carriage has been found among certain groups of those with learning disabilities (mental handicap) inresidential accommodation than in the general population. Close dailyliving contact, and the possibility of behavioural problems, may lead tostaff and other clients being at increased risk of infection. Similar considerations may apply to children and staff in day care settings and special schools for those with severe learning disability.Decisions on immunisation should be made on the basis of local riskassessments.18 Hepatitis BHepatitis B 102 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseI18.4.10 Other occupational risk groups. In some occupational groups, such as morticians and embalmers, there is an established risk of hepatitis B and immunisation is recommended. Theincidence of infection is not apparently greater than in the population asa whole for members of the police, ambulance, fire and rescue services.Nevertheless, there may be individuals within these occupations who areat higher risk and who should be considered for immunisation. Such aselection has to be decided locally by the occupational health services oras a result of appropriate medical advice following the necessary riskassessment. Immunisation is available on request to all Prison Servicestaff in regular contact with prisoners. I18.4.11 Inmates of custodial institutions. Guidance on immunisation of prisoners against hepatitis B issued by the Director of Health Care to Heads of Health Care in HM Prison Servicerecommends that immunisation against hepatitis B should be offered toall prisoners. I18.4.12 Those travelling to areas of high prevalence who intend to seek employment as health care workers or those who plan to remainthere for lengthy periods and who may therefore be at increased risk ofacquiring infection as the result of medical and dental procedures carriedout in those countries. Short term tourists or business travellers are not generally at increased risk of infection unless they place themselves at risk by their sexualbehaviour when abroad. I 18.5 Route of administration and dosage I18.5.1 The basic immunisation regimen consists of three doses of vaccine, with the first dose at the elected date, the second dose onemonth later and the third dose at six months after the first dose. An accelerated schedule has also been used where more rapid immunisation is required, for example for travellers or following exposureto the virus, when the third dose may be given at two months after theinitial dose with a booster dose at 12 months. This dosage schedule for therapid acquisition of immunity can be used to prevent perinataltransmission if given to neonates born to hepatitis B carrier mothers. Hepatitis B Immunisation against Infectious Disease 103The vaccine should normally be given intramuscularly. The injection should be given in the deltoid region, though the anterolateral thigh isthe preferred site in infants. The buttock must not be used because vaccine efficacy may be reduced. In patients with haemophilia, the subcutaneous or intradermal route may be used. The likelihood of an effective antibody response is, however,reduced following use of the intradermal route and doctors are advisedthat until such time as the manufacturers apply for and are grantedvariations to their product licences for the intradermal route ofadministration, the use of this route is on their own personalresponsibility. (For intradermal dose see 18.5.2). The response may bepoor in those who are immunosuppressed and further doses of vaccinemay be required. I18.5.2 Dosage Currently licensed products contain different concentrations of antigen per ml. The particular manufacturers dosage schedules should be adheredto. Engerix B (SmithKline Beecham) The intradermal dose ( but (0.1ml) H-B-VaxII (Pasteur Merieux MSD) I 18.6 Adverse reactions Hepatitis B vaccine is generally well tolerated and the most common adverse reactions are soreness and redness at the injection site. Injection intradermally mayproduce a persisting nodule at the site of the injection, sometimes with localpigmentation changes. Other reactions which have been reported include fever,rash, malaise and an influenza-like syndrome, arthritis, arthralgia, myalgia andabnormal liver function tests.18 Hepatitis Age 0-12 years 10 mcg (0.5ml) Adults 20 mcg (1.0 ml) 0-10 mcg (0.5ml) Adults 10 mcg (1.0ml)18 Hepatitis BHepatitis B 104 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseSerious suspected neurological reactions such as Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome and demyelinating disease have very rarely been reported although a causalrelationship with hepatitis B vaccine has not been established. It is important that all serious adverse reactions should be reported to the Committee on Safety of Medicines by the yellow card system. I 18.7 Contraindications Immunisation should be postponed in individuals suffering from severe febrile illness. I18.8 Pregnancy Hepatitis B infection in pregnant women may result in severe disease for the mother and chronic infection of the newborn. Immunisation should not bewithheld from a pregnant woman if she is in the high risk category. Information available on the outcome in those immunised during pregnancy does not reveal any cause for concern. I 18.9 Supplies of Hepatitis B vaccine Engerix B: SmithKline Beecham. Tel. 0181 B immunoglobulin (HBIG) is available for passive protection and is normally used in combination with hepatitis Bvaccine to confer passive/active immunity after exposure. Guidance isgiven in 'Exposure to hepatitis B virus; guidance on post exposureprophylaxis'. PHLS Hepatitis Subcommittee. CDR Review 1992:2;R97- R101. A summary of this guidance is given in the following table. I18.10.2 Whenever immediate protection is required, immunisation with the vaccine should be combined with simultaneous administrationof hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) at a different site. It has beenHepatitis B18 Hepatitis B Immunisation against Infectious Disease 105shown that passive immunisation with HBIG does not suppress an active immune response. A single dose of HBIG (usually 500iu for adults;200iu for the newborn) is sufficient for healthy individuals. If infectionhas already occurred at the time of immunisation, virus multiplicationmay not be inhibited completely, but severe illness and, mostimportantly, the development of the carrier state may be prevented. I18.10.3 Immunoglobulin should be administered as soon as possible after exposure. In babies born to hepatitis B carrier mothers it should begiven not later than 48 hours after birth (but see 18.11.1) and in othertypes of exposure it should preferably be given within 48 hours andcertainly no later than a week after exposure. I18.10.4 There is no evidence associating the administration of HBIG with acquisition of HIV infection. Not only does the processing of theplasma from which it is prepared render it safe, but the screening ofblood donations is now routine practice. I 18.11 Groups requiring post-exposure prophylaxis I18.11.1 Babies born to mothers who are HBeAg positive carriers, who are HBsAg positive without e markers (or where e marker statushas not been determined), or who have had acute hepatitis duringpregnancy. Active/passive immunisation is recommended (see 18.4.4). All babies of HBsAg positive mothers should receive hepatitis B vaccine but only thosewhose mothers are e-antigen positive, HBsAg positive without e-markers(or where e-marker status has not been determined) or had acutehepatitis during pregnancy will require HBIG. The first dose of vaccineshould be given at birth or as soon as possible thereafter. HBIG shouldbe given at a contralateral site at the same time; arrangements for thesupply of HBIG should be made well in advance. If administration ofHBIG is delayed for more than 48 hours, advice should be sought froma local Consultant in Communicable Disease Control, CPHM (CD &EH), Consultant in Medical Microbiology/Consultant Virologist PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre or I18.11.2 Persons who are accidentally inoculated, or who contaminate the eye or mouth or fresh cuts or abrasions of the skin,with blood from a known HBsAg positive person.

HMSO1990 ImmunoglobulinI19.1 Introduction I19.1.1 Information on specific immunoglobulins is provided in the chapters on particular vaccines. I19.1.2 All immunoglobulins are prepared from the blood of donors who are negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and for antibodyto human immunodeficiency viruses types 1 and 2 (HIV), and to hepatitisC virus (HCV). The materials are treated to inactivate viruses. I 19.2 Human Normal Immunoglobulin (HNIG) I19.2.1 This is prepared from the pooled plasma of blood donors and contains antibody to measles, varicella, hepatitis A and other viruses whichare currently prevalent in the population. Immunoglobulin prepared by BioProducts Laboratory, and supplied as below, is available in 1.7ml ampoulescontaining 250mg, and 5ml vials containing 750mg. It is given byintramuscular injection. It must be stored at 0-4\u00b0C and the expiry date onthe packet must be observed. It has a shelf life of three years when correctlystored. Unused portions of a vial must be discarded. I19.2.2 Recommendations for the use of HNIG for prophylaxis of measles and hepatitis A are given in 22.9.1 and 17.9 respectively. It isnot recommended (22.9.2) or rubella (22.9.3). I19.2.3 HNIG may interfere with the immune response to live virus vaccines which should therefore be given at least three weeks before or threemonths after an injection of HNIG. This does not apply to yellow fevervaccine since HNIG obtained from donors in the UK is unlikely to containantibody to this virus. For travellers going abroad this interval may not bepossible. In the case of live polio vaccine, this is likely to be a booster dosefor which the possible inhibiting effect of HNIG is less important.19 Immunoglobulin Immunisation against Infectious Disease 10919 Immunoglobulin 110 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseI19.3 Supplies Central Public Health Laboratory Tel. 0181-200 6868.

A dry cough isalmost invariable and there may be a sore throat. It is usually a self-limiting disease with recovery in two to seven days, but can be a seriousillness and may be complicated by bronchitis, secondary bacterialpneumonia and (in children) otitis media. The greatest morbidity andmortality from influenza is among those with underlying disease,particularly chronic respiratory and cardiac disease, and especially ifthey are also elderly. Primary influenzal pneumonia is a rarecomplication but carries a high case fatality rate. I20.1.2 Influenza is highly infectious, and, with an incubation period of 1-3 days, can spread rapidly especially in institutions. Epidemicsoccur unpredictably, and are generally associated with a large number ofexcess deaths mainly among the elderly. Even in winters when theincidence is low, 3,000-4,000 deaths may be attributed to influenza. I20.1.3 Serological studies show that asymptomatic infections also occur. I20.1.4 Two types of influenza virus are responsible for most clinical illness: influenza A and influenza B. Outbreaks of infection withinfluenza A occur most years and these are the usual cause of epidemics.Influenza B infection can also cause outbreaks, usually betweenoutbreaks of influenza A; they tend to be less extensive and to beassociated with less severe illness. I20.1.5 Influenza A viruses are antigenically labile due to changes in the principal surface antigens, haemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase(N). Minor changes ('antigenic drift') occur progressively from seasonto season. Major changes ('antigenic shift') due to acquisition of a 'new'haemagglutinin result periodically in the emergence of new sub-typeswhich, because populations may have little immunity to them, can causeepidemics or pandemics. I20.1.6 Influenza B viruses are subject to antigenic drift but with less frequent changes.20 Influenza Immunisation against Infectious Disease 11320 Influenza 114 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseI20.1.7 The World Health Organisation monitors influenza viruses throughout the world and makes recommendations each year about thestrains to be included in vaccines for the forthcoming winter. I 20.2 Influenza vaccine I20.2.1 Influenza vaccine is prepared each year using virus strains or genetic reassortants similar to those considered most likely to becirculating in the forthcoming winter. The highly purified viruses aregrown in embryonated hens' eggs, chemically inactivated and thenfurther treated and purified. Current vaccines are trivalent containingtwo type A and one type B sub-types and in recent years have given agood match with subsequently circulating viruses. A monovalent vaccinecontaining the antigens of only one strain of virus might be moreappropriately produced if a new virus with epidemic or pandemicpotential emerged. I20.2.2 Two types of vaccine are available: 'split virus' vaccines contain virus components prepared by treating whole viruses withorganic solvents or detergents and then centrifuging; 'surface antigen'vaccines contain highly purified haemagglutinin and neuraminidaseantigens prepared from disrupted virus particles. The vaccines areequivalent in efficacy and adverse reactions. I20.2.3 Currently available influenza vaccines give 70-80% protection against infection with influenza virus strains related to thosein the vaccine. In the elderly, protection against infection may be less,but immunisation has been shown to reduce the incidence ofbronchopneumonia, hospital admissions and mortality. Protection lastsfor about one year. To provide continuing protection, annualimmunisation is necessary with vaccine containing the most recentstrains. I20.2.4 Manufacture of influenza vaccine is complex and conducted to a tight schedule. Manufacturers may not be able to respond tounexpected demands for vaccine at short notice. I20.2.5 The vaccines should be stored at 2-8\u00b0C and protected from light. They must not be frozen. They should be allowed to reach roomtemperature and shaken well before they are given.InfluenzaInfluenzaI20.3 Recommendations I20.3.1 Selective immunisation is recommended to protect those who are most at risk of serious illness or death should they develop influenza.Annual influenza immunisation is therefore strongly recommended foradults and children with any of the following: a. chronic respiratory disease, including asthmab. chronic heart diseasec. chronic renal failured. diabetes mellituse. immunosuppression due to disease or treatment, including asplenia or splenic dysfunction. The risk from influenza is greater for the elderly with these conditions and increases if two or more risk conditions co-exist. I20.3.2 Immunisation is also recommended for those living in nursing homes, residential homes and other long stay facilities whererapid spread is likely to follow introduction of infection. I20.3.3 Immunisation of fit children and adults, including health care and other key workers, is not recommended as a routine. I20.3.4 The final decision as to who should be offered immunisation is a matter for the patient's medical practitioner but should take intoaccount the risk of influenza infection exacerbating the underlyingdisease as well as the risk of serious illness from influenza. I20.3.5 Any changes to these recommendations, and details of the composition and doses of each year's vaccines, are issued by theDepartments of Health in annual letters from the Chief Medical Officers.20 Influenza Immunisation against Infectious Disease 115I20.4 Increasing the uptake of influenza vaccine I20.4.1 Although uptake of influenza vaccine has increased in recent years, reports suggest that it is still under-used in the recommended riskgroups. The single most important factor in patients accepting influenzaimmunisation is that their doctor recommended it. General practitionerscan improve uptake by compiling a register of those patients for whom itis recommended, from chronic disease, computer, patient or prescriptionrecords, or as patients are seen during the year. Sufficient vaccine canthen be ordered in advance and patients invited to plannedimmunisation sessions or appointments. I 20.5 Route of administration and dosage I20.5.1 Adults and children aged 13 years and over: a single injection of 0.5ml im or deep scChildren aged 4-12 years: 0.5ml im or deep sc, repeated 4-6 weeks later if receiving influenza vaccine for the first timeChildren aged 6 months-3 years: 0.25ml im or deep sc, repeated 4-6 weeks later if receiving influenza vaccine for the first time. I20.5.2 The deltoid muscle is the recommended site for adults and older children. For infants and young children the preferred site is theanterolateral aspect of the thigh. I20.5.3 Antibody levels may take up to 10-14 days to rise. Influenza activity is not usually significant before the middle of November, andtherefore the ideal time for immunisation is October/early November. I20.5.4 Patients should be warned that many other organisms cause respiratory infections similar to influenza during the influenza seasonwhich influenza vaccine will not prevent; patients may otherwise becomedisillusioned with the vaccine especially in a non-epidemic year. I20.5.5 Influenza vaccine may be given at the same time as pneumococcal vaccine, at a different site, but note that for most patients pneumococcal vaccine is given once only (see 25.3 and 25.5).20 InfluenzaInfluenza 116 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseInfluenzaI20.6 Adverse reactions I20.6.1 Influenza vaccine is usually well tolerated apart from occasional soreness at the immunisation site. In rare instances it can,however, cause: a. Fever, malaise, myalgia and/or arthralgia beginning 6 to 12 hours after immunisation and lasting up to 48 hours. b. Immediate reactions such as urticaria, angio-oedema, bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, most likely due to hypersensitivity to residual eggprotein. I20.6.2 Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome has been reported very rarely after immunisation with influenza vaccine, although a causal relationship hasnot been established. I20.6.3 Influenza vaccine contains inactivated virus and cannot cause influenza. 20.7 Contraindications I20.7.1 The vaccines are prepared in hens' eggs and should not be given to individuals with known anaphylactic hypersensitivity to eggproducts. I20.7.2 There is no evidence that influenza vaccine prepared from inactivated virus causes damage to the fetus. However, it should not begiven during pregnancy unless there is a specific indication. 20.8 Amantadine in the prevention of influenza I20.8.1 Amantadine hydrochloride is an effective antiviral agent against influenza A and may be used prophylactically to control anoutbreak proven to be due to, or occurring during an epidemic of,influenza A in the following circumstances: a. For unimmunised patients in the 'at risk' groups for two weeks while the vaccine takes effect.20 Influenza Immunisation against Infectious Disease 117b. For patients in the 'at risk' groups for whom immunisation is unavailable or contraindicated, for the duration of the outbreak. c. For health care workers and other key personnel to prevent disruption of services during a major epidemic. I20.8.2 The recommended dose is 100mg daily. Higher doses are associated with a greater incidence of adverse reactions. I20.8.3 Adverse reactions include insomnia, restlessness and anxiety, nausea and anorexia. Epileptic fits have occasionally occurred, mainly inthe elderly taking doses higher than 100 mg/day. I20.8.4 Amantadine should not be used for prophylaxis of influenza outside these recommendations, or for prophylaxis and treatment in thesame household, as there is evidence that drug resistant virus mayemerge. I 20.9 Supplies I20.9.1 Demand for influenza vaccine sometimes increases unpredictably in response to speculation about influenza illness in thecommunity. It is therefore recommended that practices compile registersof their risk patients (see 20.3.1 and 20.3.2), and order sufficient vaccinefor their needs, well in advance of the immunisation season.

Emergence and possible transmission of amantadine-resistant viruses during nursing home outbreaks of influenza A(H3N2)Mast EE, Harmon MW, a mosquito-borne viral encephalitis caused by a flavivirus antigenically related to St Louis encephalitis virus. It occursthroughout South East Asia and the Far East where it is the leading cause ofviral encephalitis. Illness ranges from asymptomatic infection (about 1 in 200infections is estimated to become clinically apparent) to severe encephalitiswith a high mortality and a high rate (approximately 30%) of permanentneurological sequelae in survivors. It is endemic in rural areas, especiallywhere rice growing and pig farming coexist, and epidemics occur in both ruraland urban areas. Highest transmission rates occur during and just after wetseasons, when mosquitoes are most active, but seasonal patterns vary bothwithin individual countries and from year to year. I 21.2 Vaccine A formalin-inactivated whole cell vaccine derived from mouse brains is available in the UK but is unlicensed and must therefore be given on a namedpatient basis. The vial contains a single dose of vaccine which should bereconstituted with 1.3ml of Sterile Water for Injection. (For storagerecommendations, see 21.6). I 21.3 Recommendations I21.3.1 Immunisation is recommended for travellers to South East Asia and the Far East who will be staying for a month or longer inendemic areas, especially if travel will include rural areas. The risk to anindividual traveller is difficult to assess, but areas where rice growingand pig farming coexist and journeys towards the end of the Monsoonseason (roughly June-September) are likely to increase the risk.Occasionally immunisation should be considered for shorter trips wherethere is a high risk of exposure, eg extensive outdoor activities inendemic areas. More detailed country by country information iscontained in the UK Health Departments' book 'Health Information forOverseas Travel'. I21.3.2 Precautions against mosquito bites should be taken by all travellers to SE Asia.21 Japanese Encephalitis Immunisation against Infectious Disease 121I21.4 Route of administration and dosage I21.4.1 The recommended vaccine schedule is three doses of 1ml by deep subcutaneous injection on days 0, 7-14 and 28. Full immunitytakes up to a month to develop. A two dose schedule at 0 and 7-14days is said to give short term immunity in 80% of vaccinees. I21.4.2 One additional subcutaneous dose of 1ml is recommended a month after the initial course for those over 60 years of age. I21.4.3 For children under three years of age, the dose for each injection is 0.5ml by deep subcutaneous injection. I21.4.4 The duration of protection is not known. Neutralising antibody persists for at least two years after a 3-dose primary course. Abooster may be given after this time. I 21.5 Adverse reactions I21.5.1 Local reaction at the injection site may occur. I21.5.2 Allergic reactions, mainly urticaria, but also angioneurotic oedema and dyspnoea, occur occasionally within minutes or up to twoweeks after receiving the vaccine. Caution is therefore required with theuse of this vaccine; it is recommended that recipients are kept underobservation at the immunisation centre for about 30 minutes after beinggiven the vaccine and that the course is completed at least ten days priorto departure. I21.5.3 It is important that any suspected adverse reaction is reported to the supplier and to the Committee on Safety of Medicines ona yellow card. Reports to the supplier will be passed to the Departmentof Health. I 21.6 Contraindications I21.6.1 Fever or acute infection. History of Infectious DiseaseJapanese EncephalitisI21.6.3 Immunisation is not advised in pregnancy or in those with cardiac, renal or hepatic disorders, leukaemia, lymphoma or othergeneralised malignancy because of lack of data on its efficacy andadverse reactions in these conditions. I 21.7 Storage I21.7.1 The vaccine should be stored below 10\u00b0C prior to reconstitution. Exposure of the vaccine to direct sunlight should beavoided. I21.7.2 The reconstituted vaccine should be used immediately and not stored.

Clinical features include, coryza, conjunctivitis, bronchitis,Koplik spots, rash and fever. The incubation period is about ten days,with a further two to four days before the rash appears. It is highlyinfectious from the beginning of the prodromal period to four days afterthe appearance of the rash. Measles is a notifiable disease. I22.1.2 Fulfilment of criteria of a case definition is not a requirement for notification of measles but recent experience shows that few cases,notified according to clinical diagnosis, are measles. Correctly diagnosedcases tend to be those occurring in older children and in outbreaks. Thepresence of the following features may improve the accuracy of clinicaldiagnosis: rash for at least three days, fever for at least one day, and atleast one of the following - cough, coryza or conjunctivitis. I22.1.3 The diagnosis of measles (and mumps and rubella) can now be confirmed through non-invasive means. Detection of specific IgM insaliva samples, ideally taken from three days after the onset of rash or parotid swelling, has been shown to be highly sensitive and specific forconfirmation of these infections, when compared with serological testsused as standards. Whenever possible, saliva samples should be obtainedfrom all notified cases. Advice on this procedure can be obtained from thelocal Consultant in Communicable Disease Control, or Public HealthLaboratory or Consultant in Public Health Medicine (CPHM)Communicable Disease and Environmental Health (CD & EH) inScotland. I22.1.4 Complications of measles have been reported in one in 15 notified cases, and include otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia,convulsions and encephalitis. Encephalitis has an incidence of one in5000 cases, has a mortality of about 15%, and 20% to 40% ofsurvivors have residual neurological sequelae. Electro-encephalographicchanges have been reported after apparently uncomplicated measles aswell as in cases with frank encephalitis. Complications are morecommon and severe in poorly nourished and chronically ill children; it is therefore particularly important that such children should be immunisedagainst measles. I22.1.5 Case fatality rates for measles are age-related. They are high in children under one year of age, are lowest in children aged 1 to 922 Measles, Mumps and Rubella Immunisation against Infectious Disease 125NOTIFIABLEyears and then rise again with advancing age. Before 1988, more than half the acute measles deaths occurred in previously healthy childrenwho had not been immunised. I22.1.6 In children receiving immunosuppressive treatment, particularly for leukaemia, measles was a major cause of morbidity andmortality. Between 1970 and 1983, 19 children in remission from acutelymphatic leukaemia died from measles, and of 51 children who died intheir first remission in 1974-84, measles was the cause in nearlya third. I22.1.7 Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare but fatal late complication of measles infection. Most often it follows earlymeasles infection which may not necessarily have been recognised.Measles immunisation protects against SSPE. I22.1.8 Notification of measles began in England and Wales in 1940, and until the introduction of vaccine in 1968 annual notifications variedbetween 160,000 and 800,000, the peaks occurring in two year cycles.By the late 1980s, annual notifications had fallen only to between50,000 and 100,000. This limited effect came about because coveragewas never sufficiently high to have an effect on virus transmission.Between 1970 and 1988, there continued to be an average of 13 acutemeasles deaths each year. In countries where high coverage was achievedshortly after the introduction of measles immunisation, the epidemiccycle was more effectively suppressed and very low levels of measleswere observed. I22.1.9 Following the introduction of MMR vaccine in October 1988 and the achievement of coverage levels in excess of 90%,notifications of measles fell progressively to the lowest levels sincerecords began, in 1940. In 1993, there were only 9612 measlesnotifications. Since 1988, there have been only 11 deaths due to measlesrecorded in England and Wales. Most of these have been due toneurological conditions and only 4 have been due to acute measlesillness. 22 Measles, Mumps and and Rubella Immunisation against Infectious Disease 127 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 Years30 20 10 0 week/year Source: PHLS, CDSCsaliva confirmed lab confirmed imported (confirmed)NumbersLaboratory confirmed measles cases by week of onset England and and Wales (1940-1995)I22.1.10 The high coverage of MMR vaccine and the ensuing reduction of transmission meant that after 1988, children who had notbeen immunised no longer had the opportunity to be exposed to measlesinfection and remained susceptible until early teenage. A risingproportion of school age children were therefore susceptible to measles,as confirmed by age stratified sero-epidemiology. Analysis ofepidemiological data, by mathematical modelling, predicted the highprobability of a major resurgence of measles affecting for the greaterpart the school age population. Similar measles epidemics had been seenin many other countries following periods of low incidence, achievedthrough high immunisation coverage. I22.1.11 In 1993, small outbreaks of measles began to occur in England and Wales and predominantly affected secondary schoolchildren. In Scotland, a measles epidemic, affecting the west of thecountry, led to 138 teenagers being admitted to one infectious diseaseunit alone. I22.1.12 A national immunisation campaign was implemented in November 1994 throughout the United Kingdom. Over 8 millionchildren aged between 5 and 16 years were immunised with measles/rubella vaccine. As a consequence, susceptibility to measles in the targetpopulation fell by about 85% and only very few confirmed cases ofmeasles have occurred in school children. The few confirmed cases thatnow occur, mostly in adults or children too young to be protected byimmunisation, can often be linked to importation of the virus fromabroad. Reports of serious adverse reactions to the vaccine were veryrare (0.007%). I22.1.13 Mumps is an acute viral illness characterised by parotid swelling which may be unilateral or bilateral; some cases areasymptomatic. The incubation period is 14-21 days and mumps istransmissible from several days before the parotid swelling to severaldays after it appears. Complications include pancreatitis, oophoritis andorchitis; even when the latter is bilateral there is no firm evidence that itcauses sterility. Neurological complications including meningitis andencephalitis may precede or follow parotitis, and can also occur in itsabsence. Before the introduction of MMR vaccine, mumps was thecause of about 1200 hospital admissions each year in England andWales. In the under 15 age group it was a common cause of viralmeningitis; it can also cause permanent unilateral deafness at any age. 22 Measles, Mumps and Immunisation against Infectious Disease 12950 40 30 20 10 0 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 YearNumber of casesMMR vaccines introduced Source: PHLS, CDSC1-4 years > 4 yearsLaboratory cases of mumps meningitis England and Wales (1980-1995)I22.1.14 Mumps was made a notifiable disease in the UK in October 1988.

The incidence of the disease has declineddramatically in all ages, including those too old to have been immunised.Laboratory testing shows that most notified cases are not mumps.22 Measles, Mumps and Immunisation against Infectious Disease 13112 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 YearsIncidence per 100,000 populationMMR vaccines introduced Source: RCGP mean weekly incidenceAnnual incidence of mumps infections England and Wales (1985-1995)I22.1.16 Rubella is a mild infectious disease, previously common among children aged four to nine years. It causes a transienterythematous rash, lymphadenopathy involving post-auricular and sub-occipital glands and occasionally in adults, arthritis and arthralgia.Clinical diagnosis is unreliable since the symptoms are often fleeting andcan be caused by other viruses; in particular, the rash is not diagnostic ofrubella. A history of \"rubella\" should never be accepted without serological or saliva confirmation (28.1.7). The incubation period is 14- 21 days and the period of infectivity from one week before until fourdays after the onset of rash. I22.1.17 Maternal rubella infection in the first eight to ten weeks of pregnancy results in fetal damage in up to 90% of infants and multipledefects are common. The risk of damage declines to about 10-20% by 16weeks and after this stage of pregnancy, fetal damage is rare. Fetal defectsinclude mental handicap, cataract, deafness, cardiac abnormalities,retardation of intra-uterine growth and inflammatory lesions of brain,liver, lungs and bone-marrow. Any combination of these may occur; theonly defects which commonly occur alone are perceptive deafness andpigmentary retinopathy following infection after the first eight weeks ofpregnancy. Some infected infants may appear normal at birth butperceptive deafness may be detected later. For investigation of suspected rubella or exposure to rubella in pregnant women see 28.1.5. I22.1.18 Before the introduction of rubella immunisation, there were as many as 70 cases of Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS) duringepidemic years; the ratio of therapeutic to cases of CRS wasapproximately 10:1. I22.1.19 Rubella immunisation was introduced in the UK in 1970 for pre-pubertal girls and non-immune women with the aim of protectingwomen of child-bearing age from the risks of rubella in pregnancy. Thispolicy was not intended to prevent the circulation of rubella, but toincrease the proportion of women with antibody to rubella; thisincreased from 85-90% before 1970 to 97-98% by 1987 and hasremained at this level. I22.1.20 Although the selective immunisation policy was effective in reducing the number of cases of CRS and terminations of pregnancy, itbecame apparent that the elimination of rubella in pregnancy could neverbe achieved by this means. The few remaining rubella susceptible womencontinued to be exposed to rubella by their and friends' Mumps and RubellaI22.1.21 The inclusion of rubella vaccine in 1988, with measles and mumps vaccines, as MMR, was intended to interrupt circulation ofrubella amongst young children, thereby protecting susceptible adultwomen. Rubella was made a notifiable disease in 1988. I22.1.22 A considerable decline in rubella in young children followed but in 1993, there was a large increase in both notifications andlaboratory confirmed cases of rubella. Many of these cases occurred inmales in colleges and universities. However, there was also an increase inthe number of reports of rubella infections in pregnant women. Theserose from 2 in 1992 to 23 in 1993; there were 8 in 1995. Outbreaks ofrubella have continued predominantly in young males and there willcontinue to be a small number of infections in pregnant women, throughcontact with young men in this country or acquired abroad.22 Measles, Mumps and Rubella 134 Immunisation against Infectious Disease cases cases cases1984 1984 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 19951985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 19951985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995500 400 300 200 0100 400 300 200 100 0 1500 1000 500 0Children (1-14 years) Pregnant women All other categoriesYear Year Source: PHLS, CDSCYearLaboratory confirmed reports Wales (1984-1995)Measles, Mumps and RubellaI22.1.23 Sero-epidemiological surveillance has showed high levels of susceptibility to rubella in males aged 10-40 years compared to womenof this age. This difference had resulted from the effect of the selectiverubella immunisation programme which was targeted only at females.The inclusion of rubella vaccine with measles vaccine in the nationalimmunisation campaign of 1994 has reduced susceptibility to rubella inmales aged up to 16 years by about 85%. This will prevent these malesfrom transmitting rubella to susceptible pregnant women in the future.Outbreaks of rubella, as presently being seen, can be expected to stop. I22.1.24 For reporting of CRS, see 28.9. I 22.2 MMR Vaccine I22.2.1 This is a freeze-dried preparation containing live attenuated measles, mumps and rubella viruses. It must be stored in the dry state at2-8\u00b0C ( notfrozen) and protected from light. It should be reconstituted with the diluent supplied by the manufacturer and used within one hour.Immunisation provides protection for around 90% of recipients formeasles and mumps and over 95% for rubella. Vaccine-inducedantibody to rubella has been shown to persist for at least 18 years in theabsence of endemic disease. Since the vaccine viruses are nottransmitted, there is no risk of infection from vaccinees. I22.2.2 One vaccine is currently rubella vaccines are available. (See 28.7 for rubella vaccine supplies). I 22.3 Route of administration and dosage 0.5ml is given by intramuscular or deep subcutaneous Infectious Disease 135I22.4 Recommendations I22.4.1 Evidence shows that a single dose of MMR vaccine confers protection in around 90% of individuals for measles and mumps and95% for rubella. if 92% of are given MMR vaccine,with 90% efficacy for the measles component, only 83% are protectedfrom each year's birth cohort. The accumulation over time of thesesusceptible children is sufficient to allow the re-emergence of epidemicsof measles. This potential for epidemics can be prevented with a twodose programme. I22.4.2 Beginning 1 October 1996, all children, except those with a valid contraindication, should receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine. Theseare recommended to be given shortly after the first birthday and beforeschool entry. I22.4.3 MMR vaccine should be given irrespective of a history of measles, mumps or rubella infection. I22.4.4 MMR vaccine can be given to children of any age whose parents request it, and no opportunity should be missed to ensure thatthis is done. If the primary immunisations of DTP, polio and Hib havenot been completed by the time that MMR vaccine is due, they can begiven at the same time using separate syringes and different sites. Formaximum effect, vaccine must be given soon after the first birthday. I22.4.5 If parents do not wish MMR vaccine to be given at the same time as other injected vaccines, then OPV should be given with MMRand the child recalled for the other vaccines as soon as possible; in thesecircumstances no three week interval between immunisations isnecessary. I22.4.6 When children who have not received their first dose of MMR attend for their pre-school boosters (DT and polio vaccines), theyshould be offered the first MMR and arrangements made for a seconddose to be given three months after the first dose. I22.4.7 There is a group of children who were too young to be included in the measles rubella immunisation campaign of 1994 andwho have already been given their pre-school boosters. These childrenshould be recalled and given MMR vaccine. Similarly, any childrenknown not to have received DiseaseMeasles, Mumps and RubellaI22.4.8 When children attend for their school leaving immunisations, there is an opportunity to check that all recommended immunisationshave been completed. Boys and girls who have not had measles andrubella vaccine, should be offered MMR vaccine. There is nocontraindication to the simultaneous administration of MMR, Td andOPV. I22.4.9 MMR vaccine can be given to non-immune adults and should be considered for those in long-term institutional care who maynot have developed immunity. Entry into college, university or othercentres for further education provides an opportunity to check theimmunisation history. Students who have not received MR or MMRvaccine should be offered MMR immunisation. I22.4.10 Children with a personal or close family history of convulsions should be given MMR vaccine, provided the parents understand that there may be a febrile response. As for all children,advice for reducing fever should be given. Doctors should seek specialistpaediatric advice rather than refuse immunisation. Diluteimmunoglobulin as formerly used with measles vaccine for such childrenis no longer used since it may inhibit the immune response to the rubellaand mumps components. I22.4.11 Unimmunised children in the following groups are at particular risk from measles infection and should be immunised withMMR vaccine: a. Children with chronic conditions such as cystic fibrosis, congenital heart or kidney disease, failure to thrive, Down's syndrome. b. Children from the age of one year upwards in residential or day care, including playgroups and nursery schools. I22.4.12 As vaccine-induced measles antibody develops more rapidly than that following natural infection, MMR vaccine can be used toprotect susceptible contacts during a measles outbreak. To be effective the vaccine must be administered within three days of exposure. If thereis doubt about a child's immunity, vaccine should be given since there areno ill effects from vaccinating individuals who are already immune.Immunoglobulin is available for individuals for whom vaccine iscontraindicated (22.9.1). NB. Antibody responses to the rubella and mumps components of MMR vaccine are too slow for effectiveprophylaxis after exposure to these infections.22 Measles, Mumps and Rubella Immunisation against Infectious Disease 137I22.4.13 Re-immunisation is necessary when vaccine has been given before 12 months of age. I22.4.14 Measles virus inhibits the response to tuberculin, so that a false negative tuberculin test may be found for up to a month following MMR vaccine. I22.4.15 HIV positive individuals may be given MMR vaccine in the absence of contraindications. I22.5 Adverse reactions I22.5.1 Following the first dose of MMR vaccine, malaise, fever and/or a rash may occur, most commonly about a week afterimmunisation and last about two to three days. In a study of over 6000children aged one to two years, the symptoms reported were similar innature, frequency, time of onset and duration to those commonlyreported after measles vaccine. During the sixth to eleventh days aftervaccine, febrile convulsions occurred in 1/1000 children, the ratepreviously reported in the same period after measles vaccine. Parotidswelling occurred in about 1% of children of all ages up to four years,usually in the third week and occasionally later. I22.5.2 Up until September 1992, MMR vaccines containing the Urabe strain of mumps virus were in routine use. These vaccines werefound to be rarely associated with mumps meningitis, most oftenoccurring around three weeks after immunisation. No cases have been confirmed in association with the presently used Jeryl Lynn mumpsvaccine. When mumps virus is isolated from the cerebro-spinal fluid, laboratory tests can distinguish between wild and vaccine strains.Advice should be sought from the National Institute for BiologicalStandards and Control (Tel. 01707 654753). I22.5.3 Thrombocytopenia, which usually resolves spontaneously, occurs in about 1 in 24,000 children given a first dose of MMR at 12 -15 months. I22.5.4 Arthropathy (arthralgia or arthritis) has been reported to occur rarely after MMR immunisation. If it occurs other than 14-21days after immunisation, it is unlikely to have been caused by thevaccine.22 Measles, Mumps and RubellaI22.5.5 Because MMR vaccine contains live attenuated viruses, it is biologically plausible for it to cause cases of encephalitis. However, arecent review of the published evidence on encephalitis, and measles orMMR immunisation, concluded that the evidence is inadequate to acceptor reject a causal relationship between measles or mumps vaccine andencephalitis or encephalopathy. This suggests that if there is a risk ofencephalitis or encephalopathy, induced by the vaccine, it isexceptionally small. I22.5.6 23 cases of neurological disease following measles immunisation were investigated in the United States between 1965 and1967. 18 cases were characterised as 'encephalitis'. The interval fromimmunisation to the onset of symptoms ranged from 3 to 24 days. Theestimated rate of encephalitis within a four week period of measlesimmunisation was 1.5 cases per 1 million distributed doses of vaccine.The background rate of encephalitis (unrelated to immunisation) was 2.8cases per 1 million children for any 4 week period. The authors of thestudy concluded that 'no single clinical or epidemiological characteristicappears consistently in the reports of cases of possible neurologicalsequelae of measles immunisation'. I22.5.7 After a second dose of MMR vaccine, adverse reactions are considerably less common than after the first dose. One study showedno increase in fever or rash after re-immunisation of college studentscompared to unimmunised controls. Only 3 cases of thrombocytopeniawere reported in association with the immunisation of over 8 millionchildren in the November 1994 measles/rubella campaign. This suggeststhat the risk in children receiving a second dose is considerably less thanin children receiving a first dose. An analysis of adverse reactionsreported through the US Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System in1991-93 showed fewer reactions among children aged 6 to 19 years,considered to be second dose recipients, than among those aged 1-4years, considered first dose recipients. I22.5.8 Three cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) were reported following the November 1994 MR immunisation campaign. Betweenone and eight cases would have been expected in this population overthis period of time in the absence of an immunisation campaign.Analysis of reporting rates of GBS from acute flaccid paralysissurveillance undertaken in the Region of the Americas has shown noincrease in rates of GBS following measles immunisation campaignswhen over 70 million children were immunised. It was concluded fromthis evidence that measles cause and Rubella Immunisation against Infectious Disease 139I22.5.9 Parents should be told about possible symptoms after immunisation and given advice for reducing fever, including the use ofparacetamol in the period five to ten days after immunisation. Theyshould also be reassured that post-immunisation symptoms are not infectious. I22.5.10 Serious reactions should be reported to the Committee on Safety of Medicines using the yellow card system. I 22.6 Contraindications (i) If a child is suffering from an acute illness, immunisation should be postponed until recovery has occurred. Minor infections without feveror systemic upset are not reasons to postpone immunisation. Antibodyresponses and incidence of adverse reactions were the same in childrenwith or without acute mild illness, when given MMR vaccine. The acuteillnesses were upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhoea or otitis media. (ii) Children with untreated malignant disease or altered immunity; those receiving immunosuppressive or X-ray therapy or high-dosesteroids (see 7.3.1 to 7.3.7). (iii) Children who have received another live vaccine - including BCG - within three weeks (but see 7.5.2 for polio). (iv) Children with allergies to neomycin or kanamycin. (v) If MMR vaccine is given to adult women, pregnancy should be avoided for one month, as for rubella vaccine (see 28.4 and 28.6 (i)). (vi) MMR vaccine should not be given within three months of an injection of immunoglobulin.22 Measles, Mumps and DiseaseMeasles, Mumps and RubellaI22.7 Allergy to egg There is increasing evidence that MMR vaccine can be given safely to children even when they have previously had an anaphylactic reaction (generalisedurticaria, swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty in breathing,hypotension or shock) following food containing egg. A combined total of1265 patients from 16 studies has been reported. None of 284 patients withhistories of egg hypersensitivity confirmed by oral challenge, had any adversereactions. MMR was administered safely to 1209 patients with positive skintests to egg. There were only 2 reports of symptoms suggestive of anaphylaxis(0.16%). The combined data indicate that over 99% of children who areallergic to eggs can safely receive MMR vaccine. Dislike of egg, or refusal toeat it, is nota contraindication. If there is concern, paediatric advice should be sought with a view to immunisation under controlled conditions such asadmission to hospital as a day case. I 22.8 Supplies MMR vaccines are supplied by Farillon (Tel. 01708 379000) as part of the National see Chapter 19). I22.9.1 Measles Children and adults with compromised immunity (7.3.1 to 7.3.7) who come into contact with measles should be given human normalimmunoglobulin (HNIG) as soon as possible after exposure. Testing formeasles antibody may delay the administration of HNIG and neitherimmunisation nor low level antibody guarantees immunity to measles inthe immunocompromised. Children under 12 months in whom there is a particular reason to avoid measles, (such as recent severe illness), can also be givenimmunoglobulin; MMR vaccine should then be given after an interval ofat least three months, at around the usual age.22 Measles, Mumps and Rubella Immunisation against Infectious Disease 141Dose: To prevent an attack: Age Dose Under 1 year 250 mg 1-2 years 500 mg3 and over 750 mg To allow an attenuated attack: Under 1 year 100 mg1 year or over 250 mg An interval of at least three months must be allowed before subsequent MMR immunisation. Dilute immunoglobulin as previously used with measles vaccine for children with a history of convulsions is no longer used since it mayinhibit the immune response to rubella and mumps. I22.9.2 Mumps HNIG is no longer used for post-exposure protection since there is no evidence that it is effective. Mumps-specific immunoglobulin is nolonger in non-immune contacts and is therefore notrecommended for the protection of pregnant women exposed to rubella. It may however reduce thelikelihood of clinical symptoms which may possibly reduce the risk tothe fetus. It should only be used when termination of pregnancy forproved rubella infection is unacceptable to the pregnant woman, when itshould be given as soon as possible after exposure; serological follow-upof recipients is essential.

Meningococci are Gram negative diplococci which are divided into antigenically distinct groups,the commonest of which in the UK are B, C, A, Y and W135. They arefurther subdivided by type and sulphonamide sensitivity. I 23.1.2 Group B strains account for approximately two thirds of all isolates submitted to the Public Health Laboratory ServiceMeningococcal Reference Laboratory. Group C strains contribute aboutone third, but some years can be higher. Group A strains are rare in thiscountry (less than 2%) but are the epidemic strains in other parts of theworld. I 23.1.3 Irregular upsurges of meningococcal infection occur in the United Kingdom with the last previous wave in the mid 1970s. Thepresent upsurge began in 1984: there were peaks in 1989/90 and 1995/6.The disease is commonest in the winter. An association has beendemonstrated between the seasonal onset of influenza activity andmeningococcal disease. The incidence of meningococcal disease ishighest in infants followed by one to five year old children, but the recentincrease of Group C disease has been associated with an increasedincidence in school age children and young adults.23 MeningococcalMeningococcal 148 Immunisation against Infectious Disease Years15 10 5 0 1912 1922 1932 1942 1952 1962 1972 1982 19921 2 3 41 Cerebrospinal fever 2 Meningococcal infection caemiaNotifications (1912-1995)Meningococcal23 Meningococcal Immunisation against Infectious Disease 149I 23.1.4 The carriage rate for all meningococci in the normal population is about 10% although rates vary with age; about 25% ofyoung adults may be carriers at any one time. I 23.1.5 Meningococci are transmitted by droplet spread or direct contact from carriers or from individuals in the early stages of the illness;the probable route of invasion is via the nasopharynx. The incubationperiod is two to three days, and the onset of disease varies fromfulminant to insidious with mild prodromal symptoms. Early symptomsand signs are usually malaise, pyrexia and vomiting. Headache,photophobia, drowsiness or confusion, joint pains and a typicalhaemorrhagic rash of meningococcal septicaemia may develop. Early on, the rash may be non-specific. The rash, which may be petechial or purpuric, does not blanche and this can be confirmed readily by gentlepressure with a glass, when the rash can be seen to persist. Patients maypresent in coma. In young infants particularly, the onset may beinsidious and the classical signs absent. The diagnosis should besuspected in the presence of vomiting, pyrexia, irritability and, if stillpatent, raised anterior fontanelle tension. I 23.1.6 Overall mortality from meningococcal infection is around 7- 8% and has changed little for 20 years. Meningitis is the commonestpresentation, but in about 15-20% of cases, features of septicaemiapredominate. Mortality is 3-5% in meningitis and 15-20% insepticaemia. Current expert advice endorses the importance of earlyrecognition, prompt antibiotic treatment and speedy referral to hospitalfor all suspected cases. Benzylpenicillin is the antibiotic of choice andshould be administered by the general practitioner before transfer tohospital. The recommended dose is 1,200 mg for adults and childrenaged 10 years or more, 600 mg for children aged 1 to 9 years, and 300mg for those aged less than 1 year. Benzylpenicillin should be withheld ifthere is a known history of anaphylaxis following previous penicillinadministration. Although benzylpenicillin may reduce the chance ofisolating the causative organism, this is outweighed by the benefit to thepatient, and new techniques are becoming available that facilitate thediagnosis of meningococcal disease even after antibiotics have been given.I 23.2 Vaccine I 23.2.1 Currently available meningococcal vaccine is a purified, heat stable, lyophilised extract from the polysaccharide outer capsule ofNeisseria meningitidis, effective against serogroup A and C organisms.Vaccine contains 50mcg each of the respective purified bacterial capsularpolysaccharides. There is no available vaccine effective against Group B organisms. I 23.2.2 A serological response is detected in more than 90% of recipients and occurs five to seven days after a single injection. Theresponse is strictly Group specific and confers no protection againstGroup B organisms. Young infants respond less well than adults withlittle response to the Group C polysaccharide below 18 months andsimilar lack of response to Group A polysaccharide below three months.Vaccine induced immunity lasts approximately three to five years; inyounger children a more rapid decline in antibody has been noted.Conjugated vaccines on the same lines as Hib vaccines are presentlybeing investigated for suitability for infant use to protect against GroupC meningococcal infections. I 23.2.3 Vaccine must be stored at 2-8\u00b0C and the diluent must not be frozen. Vaccine should be reconstituted immediately before use with thediluent supplied by the manufacturer. I 23.3 Route of administration and dosage A single dose of 0.5ml is given by deep subcutaneous or intramuscular injection to adults and children from two months of age. I 23.4 Recommendations I 23.4.1 Routine immunisation with meningococcal vaccine is not recommended as the overall risk of meningococcal disease is very low,Group B organisms are the major cause of disease in the UnitedKingdom and a considerable number of cases of meningococcal diseasefrom Group C organisms occur in children too young to be protectedwith presently available vaccines. I 23.4.2 Asplenic children and adults, irrespective of age or the interval from splenectomy, should receive a single dose of meningococcal23 MeningococcalMeningococcal 150 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseMeningococcal23 Meningococcal Immunisation against Infectious Disease 151vaccine before travelling to areas where there is an increased risk of Group A infection. Otherwise the vaccine should be restricted to groupsfor whom it is otherwise specifically recommended (see 23.4.3 to 23.4.5). I 23.4.3 Contacts of cases: Close contacts of cases of meningococcal meningitis have a considerably increased risk of developing the disease inthe subsequent months, despite appropriate chemoprophylaxis. Therecommended schedule for prophylaxis rifampicin 600mg every 12hours for twodays in adults, 10mg/kg dose for children over one year of age and 5mg/kg for children less than one year. Ciprofloxacin as a singledose of 500mg is an alternative for adults but is not yet licensed in theUK for this purpose. Ceftriaxone 250mg intramuscularly can be given topregnant contacts, but is not licensed in the UK for this purpose.Immediate family or close contacts of cases of Group A or Group Cmeningitis should be given meningococcal vaccine in addition tochemoprophylaxis. The latter should be given first and the decision tooffer vaccine should be made when the results of typing are available.Vaccine should not be given to contacts of Group B cases. I 23.4.4 Local Outbreaks: In addition to sporadic cases, outbreaks of meningococcal infections with Group C organisms tend to occur inclosed or semi-closed communities such as schools and militaryestablishments. Immunisation has been shown to be effective incontrolling epidemics, reducing infection rates but not carriage rates.Advice on the use of meningococcal vaccines is available from: PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (0181-200 6868). Public Health Laboratory Service Meningococcal Reference Laboratory (0161 445 2416). Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health (0141 946 7120). Scottish Meningococcal and Pneumococcal Reference Laboratory (0141 201 3836). Meningococcal vaccine has no part to play in the management of outbreaks of Group B meningococcal meningitis.I 23.4.5 Travel: In some areas of the world the risk of acquiring meningococcal infection is much higher than in this country particularlyfor those visitors who live or travel 'rough', such as backpackers, andthose living or working with local people. Immunisation isrecommended for longer visits (generally a month or more), especially ifbackpacking or living or working with local people, to: (i) Sub-Saharan Africa: Epidemics, mainly Group A infections, occur throughout tropical Africa particularly in the Savanna in the dry season which variesfrom country to country and can be unpredictable. More detailedcountry by country information is contained in the UK HealthDepartments' book 'Health Information for Overseas Travel'. (ii) the area around Delhi, and Nepal, Bhutan and Pakistan.(iii) Since 1988, following an outbreak of Group A meningococcal meningitis in 1987, Saudi Arabia has required immunisation ofpeople coming to the Haj annual pilgrimage. I 23.4.6 Meningococcal vaccine may be given to HIV positive individuals in the absence of contraindications. I 23.5 Adverse Reactions I 23.5.1 Generalised reactions are rare although pyrexia occurs more frequently in young children than in adults. I 23.5.2 Injection site reactions occur in approximately 10% of recipients and last for approximately 24-48 hours. I 23.5.3 Serious reactions should be reported to the Committee on Safety of Medicines using the yellow card system I 23.6 Contraindications I 23.6.1 Immunisation should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute febrile illness.23 MeningococcalMeningococcal 152 Immunisation Infectious Disease 153I 23.6.2 Although there is no information to suggest that meningococcal vaccine is unsafe during pregnancy, it should only begiven when this is unavoidable, ie. when there is true risk of disease.During an epidemic of meningococcal meningitis in Brazil, no adverseevents were reported in pregnant women receiving vaccine. I 23.6.3 A severe reaction to a preceding dose of meningococcal vaccine is a contraindication to further doses.

A case is infectious from seven days afterexposure to three weeks after the onset of typical paroxysms. The initialcatarrhal stage has an insidious onset and is the most infectious period.An irritating cough gradually becomes paroxysmal, usually within one totwo weeks, and often lasts for two to three months. In young infants, thetypical 'whoop' may never develop and coughing spasms may befollowed by periods of apnoea. Pertussis may be complicated bybronchopneumonia, repeated post-tussive vomiting leading to weightloss, and by cerebral hypoxia with a resulting risk of brain damage.Severe complications and deaths occur most commonly in infants undersix months of age. I 24.1.2 Before the introduction of pertussis immunisation in the 1950s, the average annual number of notifications in England and Wales(E and W) exceeded 100,000. In 1972, when vaccine acceptance wasover 80%, there were only 2069 notifications of pertussis. I 24.1.3 Because of public anxiety about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, acceptance rates fell to about 30% in 1975 and major epidemicswith over 100,000 notified cases followed (in E and W) in 1977/79 and1981/83. However increased vaccine uptake, resulting from the return ofprofessional and public confidence, cut short the next epidemic whichdied away in 1986, well below the levels of the previous two. In 1992,when uptake had risen to 92%, there were only 2309 notifications, thelowest annual total since 1972. In keeping with the cyclical pattern ofpertussis epidemics, notifications rose in 1993, but only reached 4091.By 1995, coverage by the second birthday was 94%; there were 1873notifications. This is the lowest annual figure ever recorded.24 PertussisPertussis 156 Immunisation against Infectious Disease 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 Years100 80 60 40Coverage Notifications Coverage %200 150100 50 0Notifications Thousands 0Pertussis notifications to ONS and vaccine coverage figures for children by their 2nd birthday England and Wales (1940-1995)Pertussis24 Pertussis Immunisation against Infectious Disease 157I 24.1.4 Until the mid 1970s, mortality from pertussis was about one per 1000 notified cases with a higher rate for infants under one year. In1978 however when there were over 65,000 notifications (in E and W),only 12 deaths were notified. The actual number of deaths due topertussis is undoubtedly higher since not all cases in infants arerecognised. In 1990, there were six deaths from pertussis, all in infantsunder four months of age. The timing of routine pertussis immunisationwas accelerated in 1990; from 1991 to 1995 only five deaths attributedto pertussis were reported (in England and Wales), all in infants tooyoung to be immunised. I 24.1.5 Since the anxieties in the mid 1970s concerning pertussis vaccine, studies have confirmed that a full course of vaccine confersprotection in over 80% of recipients; in those not fully protected thedisease is usually less severe. The two large epidemics which followed thereduction in vaccine acceptance are additional evidence of theeffectiveness of pertussis vaccine in the prevention of disease. In Regionswith particularly low vaccine coverage, pertussis notifications in 1986were significantly higher than those in Regions with high coverage. I 24.2 Vaccine I 24.2.1 Pertussis vaccine is a suspension of killed Bordetella pertussis organisms with an estimated potency of not less than four InternationalUnits in each 0.5ml of vaccine. The vaccine is usually given as a triplevaccine combined with diphtheria and tetanus vaccines (DTP), with anadjuvant such as aluminium hydroxide. The plain vaccine is no longersupplied as it is less immunogenic and causes more systemic reactions,especially fever. I 24.2.2 Adsorbed diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis vaccine (DTP): one 0.5ml dose consists of a mixture in isotonic buffer solution of diphtheriatoxoid and tetanus toxoid adsorbed on to aluminium hydroxide gel,together with not more than 20,000 million Bordetella pertussisorganisms. The potency of the diphtheria component is not less than 30iu; that of the tetanus component not less than 60 iu and that of thepertussis component not less than an estimated 4 iu. Thiomersal is addedas a preservative to a final concentration of 0.01%.I 24.2.3 At present, there is no supplier of monovalent whole cell pertussis vaccine. As an alternative, an acellular monovalent preparation (Acellular Pertussis Vaccine (APV)) is available for use on a 'namedpatient' basis. This vaccine contains approximately 3 \u00b5g of highlypurified pertussis toxin (PT), 36 \u00b5g of filamentous haemagglutinin(FHA) and small quantities of Pertactin (or 69 kilodalton outermembrane protein) and type 2 fimbriae. The vaccine is adsorbed ontoalum hydroxide and phosphate gel and contains thiomersal preservative. I 24.2.4 The vaccines should be stored between 2-8\u00b0C, but not frozen. If the vaccine is frozen, it should not be used. Vaccine that has been frozencan be identified by the following test: using an ampoule of DTP vaccinethat has not been frozen as a control, shake both ampoules, inspect thecontents, leave the ampoules to stand for 15 - 30 minutes and inspectagain. Frozen vaccine remains cloudy with clumps of flocculated material. I 24.2.5 Protect the vaccine from light. Disposal should be by incineration at a temperature not less than 1100\u00b0C at a registered wastedisposal contractor. I 24.3 Route of administration and dosage The dose of DTP and APV is 0.5ml, given by deep subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. I 24.4 Recommendations I 24.4.1 Adsorbed pertussis vaccine as a component of the primary course of immunisation against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP)is recommended for all infants from two months of age, unless there is agenuine contraindication (see Chapter 7). I 24.4.2 The primary course consists of t hree doses with an interval of one month between each dose (see Chapter 11). If the primary course is interrupted it should be resumed but not repeated, allowingappropriate intervals between the remaining doses. I 24.4.3 Monovalent acellular pertussis vaccine can be given when the pertussis component has been omitted from earlier immunisations.Children who have received a full course of immunisation againstdiphtheria and tetanus should be given three doses of monovalent24 PertussisPertussis 158 Immunisation against Infectious DiseasePertussis24 Pertussis Immunisation against Infectious Disease 159pertussis vaccine at monthly intervals. APV has been made available solely for this purpose and should not be used in place of the existingDTP for routine primary immunisation. I 24.4.4 Where the primary course of diphtheria/tetanus immunisation has been started and the parent wishes pertussis vaccine to be added,DTP vaccine may be used for the subsequent doses, followed by acellularpertussis vaccine at monthly intervals to complete the three doses.Similarly, children presenting for their pre-school diphtheria/tetanusbooster who have not previously been immunised against pertussisshould be given triple vaccine as the first dose, with two subsequentdoses of acellular pertussis vaccine at monthly intervals. I 24.4.5 Research from the UK and other countries shows that local reactions and pyrexias occur less often after acellular pertussis vaccinethan after whole cell vaccine, especially when the immunisation is givenafter 6 months of age. When the primary immunisation against pertussis was not completed because of a local reaction or pyrexia, it can becompleted with acellular pertussis vaccine. I 24.4.6 The low uptake of pertussis vaccine from 1975-1985 left a considerable number of unimmunised older children who received DTvaccine only. Such children can be immunised with monovalent acellularpertussis vaccine, both for their own protection and for that of youngsiblings under the age of immunisation; there is no upper age limit . I 24.4.7 No reinforcing dose of pertussis vaccine is currently recommended after a course of three injections. I 24.4.8 Children with problem histories: When there is a personal or family history of febrile convulsions, there is an increased risk of these occurring after pertussis immunisation. Insuch children, immunisation is recommended but advice on the prevention of fever should be given at the time of immunisation. In a recent British study, children with a family or personal history of epilepsy were immunised with pertussis vaccine without any significant adverse events. These childrens' developmental progress has beennormal. In children with a close family history (first degree relatives) of idiopathic epilepsy , there may be a risk of developing a similar condition, irrespective of vaccine. Immunisation is recommended for these children and for those with a personal history of epilepsy (see below). Advice on the prevention of pyrexia should be given.Where there is a still evolving neurological problem, immunisation should be deferred until the condition is stable. Children whose epilepsy is well controlled may receive pertussis vaccine . When there has been a documented history of cerebral damage in the neonatal period,immunisation should be carried out unless there is evidence of anevolving neurological abnormality. If immunisation is to be deferred,then this should be stated on the neonatal discharge summary. Where there is doubt, appropriate advice should be sought from a ConsultantPaediatrician, District (Health Board) Immunisation Co-ordinator orConsultant in Communicable Disease Control rather than withholdingvaccine. I 24.4.9 HIV positive individuals may receive pertussis vaccine in the absence of contraindications. I 24.4.10 If pertussis vaccine is contraindicated, then DT should be offered. There may be an opportunity at a later date to completepertussis immunisation using APV. I 24.5 Adverse reactions I 24.5.1 a. Swelling and redness at the injection site are common. A small painless nodule may form at the injection site; this usuallydisappears and is of no consequence. The incidence of local reactionsand pyrexias has been shown to be lower following the acceleratedschedule than the previous extended schedule. b. Crying, screaming and fever may occur after pertussis vaccine in triple vaccine; they may also occur after vaccine which does not containthe pertussis component. Attacks of high pitched screaming, episodes ofpallor, cyanosis, limpness, convulsions, as well as local reactions havebeen reported after both adsorbed DTP and DT vaccines. Both local andsystemic reactions were more common after the plain preparationswhich did not contain adjuvant. c. More severe neurological conditions, including encephalopathy and prolonged convulsions, resulting in permanent brain damage and death,have been reported after pertussis vaccine. But similar illnesses can developfrom a variety of causes in the first year of life in both immunised andunimmunised children and there is no specific test which can identify caseswhich may be caused by pertussis vaccine. Therefore, no wholly reliableestimate of the risk of such complications due to the vaccine can be made. 24 PertussisPertussis 160 Immunisation against Infectious DiseasePertussis24 Pertussis Immunisation against Infectious Disease 161d. For these reasons, there has been considerable public and professional anxiety about the safety of pertussis vaccine. In Great Britain, between1976 and 1979, a total of 1182 children with serious acute neurologicalillnesses were reported to the National Childhood Encephalopathy Study(NCES). Only 39 of these children had recently had pertussis vaccineand in many of these, the association of the neurological illnesses withimmunisation could have occurred by chance. e. Analysis of the results of the NCES showed that, after taking this into account, the vaccine may very rarely be associated with the developmentof severe acute neurological illness in children who were previouslyapparently normal; most of these children suffered no apparent harm.The occurrence of a severe encephalopathy after pertussis immunisationwas sometimes associated with long-term residual neurological damage,but the evidence is insufficient to indicate whether or not DTP increasesthe overall risk of chronic neurological dysfunction. The number of cases in the NCES, even after three years of intensive case finding, wastoo small to show conclusively whether or not the vaccine could causepermanent brain damage if such damage occurs at all. f. These conclusions have been confirmed by a recent large case control study from the United States that found no significant increased risk ofserious acute neurological illness in the seven days after DTP vaccine inchildren under 2 years of age. g. In the USA, a group of children who had had convulsions or hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes within 48 hours of DTP werereviewed six to seven years later; there was no evidence of seriousneurological damage or intellectual impairment as a result of theseepisodes. In another American study, while an association wasdemonstrated between the first febrile convulsion and the scheduled ageof pertussis immunisation, no relationship was demonstrated betweenimmunisation and the age of onset of epilepsy. h. A major review of studies on adverse events after pertussis vaccine was published by the United States Institute of Medicine in 1991. Thisconcluded that the evidence did not indicate a causal relationshipbetween pertussis vaccine and infantile spasms, hypsarrhythmia, Reye'ssyndrome and Sudden Infant Death syndrome. i. Neurological complications after pertussis disease are considerably more common than after vaccine. j. Cot deaths (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) occur most commonly during the first year of life and may therefore coincide with the giving ofDTP vaccine. However studies have established that this association istemporal rather than causal. The incidence of SIDS appears to be lowerin children who have had pertussis vaccine than in those who have not. I 24.5.2 Recently available data from linkage of hospital admission records with immunisation details shows that there is no increase in the likelihood of a febrile convulsion requiring admission to hospital in theweek following pertussis containing vaccine, compared with thebackground risk, if children are immunised before 6 months of age . Immunisation with pertussis containing vaccine after 6 months of age is associated with an increased risk of febrile convulsion, particularly withthe third dose. If a febrile convulsion occurs after a dose of triplevaccine, specialist advice should be sought before continuing with anyimmunisation. Children having such convulsions are at increased riskof further febrile convulsions following subsequent immunisations.However, these risks can be minimised by appropriate measures toprevent fever (eg paracetamol and tepid sponging) and i mmunisation is recommended. I 24.5.3 It has been suggested that pertussis vaccine is linked with the development of asthma. A recent double-blind study of pertussisvaccines found no significant differences between DTP immunisedchildren and controls for reported wheezing, itchy rash or sneezing. Theresults suggest that there is no reason to withhold pertussisimmunisation because of fear of subsequent asthma or allergy. I 24.5.4 When pertussis vaccine is genuinely contraindicated, immunisation against diphtheria and tetanus should still be considered. I 24.5.5 Severe or unusual reactions to pertussis vaccine must be reported to the Committee on Safety of Medicines using the yellow cardsystem. I 24.6 Contraindications to pertussis immunisation I 24.6.1 a. If the child is suffering from any acute illness, immunisation should be postponed until the child has recovered. Minorinfections without fever or systemic upset are not reasons to postponeimmunisation.24 PertussisPertussis 162 Immunisation against Infectious DiseasePertussisb. Immunisation should not be carried out in children who have a history of a general reaction to a preceding dose. In these children,immunisation should be completed with DT vaccine. Where there hasbeen a local reaction or a pyrexia, acellular pertussis vaccine may beused (see 24.4.5). The following reactions should be regarded as severe: Local: an extensive area of redness and swelling which becomes indurated and involves most of the antero-lateral surface of the thigh ora major part of the circumference of the upper arm. General: fever equal to or more than 39.5\u00b0F within than 4 hours; convulsions or encephalopathyoccurring within 72 hours. I 24.6.2 A personal or family history of allergy is nota contraindication to immunisation against pertussis, nor are stableneurological conditions such as cerebral palsy or spina bifida. For other'false contraindications' see 7.6 and 7.7. Where there is doubt, appropriate advice should be sought from a consultant paediatrician, District (Health Board) Immunisation Co-ordinator or Consultant in Communicable Disease Control, rather thanwithholding vaccine. I 24.7 Management of outbreaks Since a course of three injections is required to protect against pertussis, vaccine cannot be used to control an outbreak. 24 Pertussis Immunisation against Infectious Disease 16324 PertussisPertussis 164 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseI 24.8 Supplies DTP vaccines are manufactured by Evans Medical Ltd.

Lack of Assosiation between Pertussis Vaccination and Symptoms of Asthma and AllergyNillson L et al.JAMA, (pneu monia, bacteraemia and meningitis) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, especially amongthe very young, the elderly, those with an absent or non-functioning spleenand those with other causes of impaired immunity. The pneumococcus isthe commonest cause of community acquired pneumonia. Pneumococcalpneumonia is estimated to affect 1/1000 adults each year and has amortality of 10-20%. The pneumococcus is also one of the mostfrequently reported causes of bacteraemia and meningitis. During 1995,3,897 laboratory isolates from blood or CSF were reported to the PublicHealth Laboratory Service. Recurrent infections may occur associated withabnormalities such as fractures of the skull. I25.1.2 Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is an encapsulated Gram 84 capsular types have beencharacterised, of which 8-10 cause two thirds of the serious infections inadults and about 85% of infections in children. Immunity to infection iscomplicated, but depends greatly on type specific anti-capsular antibodies.However the level of antibody required for protection is not currently known. I25.1.3 Antimicrobial resistance among S. pneumoniae is increasing in the UK and worldwide and susceptibility to penicillin, cephalosporin andmacrolide antimicrobials can no longer be assumed. In 1994, 2.5% ofbacteraemia and meningitis isolates reported to the PHLS in England andWales showed full or intermediate resistance to penicillin and 11.2% wereresistant to erythromycin. I 25.2 Pneumococcal Vaccine I25.2.1 Pneumococcal vaccine is a polyvalent vaccine containing 25 microgrammes of purified capsular polysaccharide from each of 23capsular types of pneumococcus which together account for about 90%of the pneumococcal isolates causing serious infection in Britain. It issupplied in a single dose vial. I25.2.2 Most healthy adults develop a good antibody response to a single dose of the vaccine by the third week following immunisation.Antibody response is not so reliable in young children, those withimmunological impairment (including an absent or dysfunctional spleen)and those being treated with immunosuppressive therapy. Antibodyresponse in children under two years of age is likely to be poor.25 PneumococcalPneumococcal 168 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseI25.2.3 Many studies of efficacy have found it difficult to reach firm conclusions, but overall efficacy in preventing pneumococcal pneumoniais probably 60-70%. The vaccine is less effective in children under twoyears of age and in those with immunosuppression. It has been relativelyineffective in patients with multiple myeloma, Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins lymphoma, especially during treatment, and in chronicalcoholism. It does not prevent otitis media or exacerbations of chronicbronchitis, and since so much pneumococcal meningitis is in youngchildren and those with skull defects, its scope for preventing this diseaseis limited. I25.2.4 Antibody levels usually begin to wane after about five years, but may decline more rapidly in asplenic patients and children withnephrotic syndrome. I 25.2.5 Vaccine should be stored unopened at 2-8\u00b0C and inspected before being given to check that it is clear, colourless and withoutsuspended particles. I 25.3 Recommendations I25.3.1 Pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for all those aged two years or older in whom pneumococcal infection is likely to be morecommon and/or dangerous, ie those with: i. Asplenia or severe dysfunction of the spleen, including homozygous sickle cell disease and coeliac syndrome ii. Chronic renal disease or nephrotic syndromeiii. Immunodeficiency or immunosuppression due to disease or treatment, including HIV infection at all stages iv. Chronic heart diseasev. Chronic lung diseasevi. Chronic liver disease including cirrhosisvii. Diabetes mellitusPneumococcal25 Pneumococcal Immunisation against Infectious Disease 169I25.3.2 Where possible, the vaccine should be given, together with advice about the increased risk of pneumococcal infection, four to sixweeks (but at least two weeks) before splenectomy and before courses ofchemotherapy. If this is not practicable, as in traumatic splenectomy, thevaccine should be given as soon as possible after recovery from theoperation, and before discharge from hospital. If not given beforechemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, immunisation should be delayed untilat least six months after completion of therapy. I25.3.3 Additional measures for asplenic and hyposplenic patients: Haemophilus influenzae b, influenza, and in some circumstancesmeningococcal vaccines are additionally recommended and antibioticprophylaxis (usually phenoxymethyl penicillin) is advisable at least untilthe age of 16 years. New guidelines have recently been published and apatient card and information sheet are available from the Department ofHealth (details at the end of this chapter). I25.3.4 It is recommended that GPs actively identify and contact unimmunised asplenic patients to offer them advice and to immunisethem. I25.3.5 It is also recommended that GPs identify patients on their lists in the other groups for whom vaccine is recommended (25.3.1) andthat doctors take opportunities to immunise those who have notpreviously been immunised: i. at routine GP or hospital consultationsii. on discharge after hospital admissioniii. when immunising against influenza.I25.3.6 Pneumococcal vaccine may be given at the same time as influenza vaccine, at a different site, but note that whereas influenzavaccine must be given annually, for most patients pneumococcal vaccineis given once only and re-immunisation may cause adverse reactions (see25.5 and 25.6.2).I25.4 Route of administration and dosage A single dose of 0.5ml is given subcutaneously or intramuscularly preferably into the deltoid muscle or lateral aspect of the mid thigh. Intradermalinjection may cause severe local reaction. The vaccine must not be givenintravenously. The vaccine is used as supplied. No dilution or reconstitution isnecessary. I 25.5 Re-immunisation Re-immunisation is not normally advised (see 25.6.2) except, after 5-10 years, in individuals in whom antibody levels are likely to have declined more rapidlysuch as those with no spleen, with splenic dysfunction or with nephroticsyndrome. A few centres are able to measure antibody levels in cases wherethere is doubt about the need for re-immunisation. This should first bediscussed with a local haematologist. I 25.6 Adverse Reactions I25.6.1 Mild soreness and induration at the site of injection and, less commonly, a low grade fever may occur. I25.6.2 Re-immunisation with the earlier 12 and 14-valent vaccines produced more severe reactions in some recipients, especially if less thanthree years had elapsed since the first injection. Reactions correlatedwith high levels of circulating antibodies. The same considerations arelikely to apply to re-immunisation with the 23-valent vaccine. I 25.7 Contraindications I25.7.1 Pneumococcal vaccine should not be given during an acute infection. The vaccine is not recommended in pregnancy or in womenwho are breast feeding. I25.7.2 Re-immunisation within three years of a previous dose of pneumococcal vaccine is contraindicated.25 PneumococcalPneumococcal 170 Immunisation against 171I25.8 I25.8.1 Ltd.

The virus has a high affinity for nervous tissue and replicates inmotor neurones. The infection may be clinically inapparent, or range inseverity from a non-paralytic fever to aseptic meningitis or paralysis.Symptoms include headache, gastro-intestinal disturbance, malaise andstiffness of the neck and back, with or without paralysis. The infectionrate in households with young children can reach 100%. The proportionof inapparent to paralytic infections may be as high as 1000 to one inchildren and 75 to one in adults, depending on the polio virus type andthe social conditions. Poliomyelitis remains endemic in some developingcountries where it occurs in epidemics. In countries where the diseaseincidence is low, but transmission is still occurring, polio cases are seensporadically or as outbreaks amongst unimmunised individuals.Transmission is through contact with the faeces or pharyngeal secretionsof an infected person. In industrialised countries, transmission is mostlikely to be through the oro-pharyngeal route. I 26.1.2 The incubation period ranges from three to 21 days. Cases are most infectious from seven to ten days before and after the onset ofsymptoms; virus may be shed in the faeces for up to six weeks or longer. I 26.1.3 Inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine (Salk) was introduced in 1956 for routine immunisation, and was replaced by attenuated live oralvaccine (Sabin) in 1962. Individuals born before 1958 may not have been immunised and no opportunity should be missed to immunise them inadult life. Since the introduction of vaccine, notifications of paralytic poliomyelitis (in England and Wales) have dropped from nearly 4,000 in1955 to a total of 35 cases between 1974-1978. This included 25 casesduring 1976 and 1977, in which infection with wild virus occurred inunimmunised persons, demonstrating the continuing need to maintainhigh levels of immunisation uptake. From 1985-95, 28 cases werereported. 19 were vaccine associated (14 recipients, 5 contacts), 6 wereimported; the source of infection could not be found in 3 cases, but innone of whom could wild virus be detected. 26 PoliomyelitisPoliomyelitis 174 Immunisation against Infectious Disease 10 8 6 4 2 0 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 YearsCases ThousandsIPV OPV 1985 1990 1995 VA(C) VA(R) TypeReported cases of paralytic poliomyelitis by aetiolgy (all sources) England and Wales (1985-1995) 5 4 3 2 1 0Notified cases of paralytic poliomyelitis to ONS England and Wales (1940-1995)Poliomyelitis26 Poliomyelitis Immunisation against Infectious Disease 175I 26.1.4 By March 1996, coverage for poliomyelitis immunisation was 96% by the second birthday. I 26.1.5 The World Health Organisation has included the UK among the countries which are likely to have eliminated indigenous poliomyelitisdue to wild virus. In any case of childhood acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), including Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome, it is essential to obtain two faecalsamples 24 to 48 hours apart, as soon as possible after the onset ofparalysis for viral examination. Ideally, faecal samples should also beobtained from household and other close contacts. In the Region of the Americas, where there has been no single case of wild virus poliomyelitissince August 1991, it was recommended that faecal samples should beobtained from at least 5 close contacts of each childhood AFP case. I 26.1.6 In September 1994, after 3 years with no single case of wild virus poliomyelitis, an international commission certified that polio virustransmission had been interrupted in the region of the Americas andpolio could be considered to have been eliminated from that region. I 26.2 Poliomyelitis vaccine (Live and Inactivated) I 26.2.1 Live Oral polio vaccine (OPV) is routinely used for immunisation in the UK, always given by mouth. It contains liveattenuated strains of poliomyelitis virus types 1, 2 and 3 grown incultures of monkey kidney cells or in human diploid cells. Theattenuated viruses become established in the intestine and promoteantibody formation both in the blood and in the gut epithelium,providing local resistance to subsequent infection with wild poliomyelitisviruses. This reduces the frequency of symptomless excretion of wildpoliomyelitis virus in the community. OPV inhibits simultaneousinfection by wild polio viruses and is thus of value in the control ofepidemics. Vaccine strain poliomyelitis virus may persist in the faeces forup to six weeks after OPV. This provides an additional communitybenefit as contacts of recently immunised children may be protectedthrough acquisition of vaccine virus. I 26.2.2 Whilst a single dose of polio vaccine may give protection, a course of three doses produces long-lasting immunity to all three poliovirus types. I 26.2.3 OPV manufactured by SmithKline Beecham should be stored at 2-8\u00b0C and OPV manufactured by Evans should be stored at 0-4\u00b0C.The expiry date should be checked before use. Vaccine stored unopenedat the temperature recommended by manufacturers is stable, but oncethe containers are open it may lose its potency. Protect from light. Anyvaccine remaining in opened containers at the end of an immunisationsession must be discarded. I 26.2.4 Enhanced potency inactivated polio vaccine (eIPV) contains polio viruses of all three types inactivated by formaldehyde. It should bestored at 2-8\u00b0C but not frozen. 0.5ml is given by subcutaneous injection(26.6.1). A course of three injections at monthly intervals produces long-lasting immunity to all three polio virus types. IPV can be given from 2months of age. I 26.2.5 When IPV has been given previously, subsequent immunisation can be carried out using OPV if appropriate. Similarly,when OPV has been used initially, immunisation can be completed withIPV if needed. I 26.3 Recommendations I 26.3.1 Primary immunisation of infants and children Oral polio vaccine is recommended for infants from two months of age. The primary course consists of three separate doses with intervals of onemonth between each dose (see 11.1), given at the same time asdiphtheria/tetanus/pertussis and Hib vaccine. The dose of vaccine should be repeated if it is regurgitated. I 26.3.2 Breast-feeding does not interfere with the antibody response to OPV and immunisation should not be delayed on this account. I 26.3.3 Faecal excretion of vaccine virus can last up to six weeks and may lead to infection of unimmunised contacts; such infection mayprovide protection of previously susceptible individuals, but see 7.3, 7.4,7.7.5, and 26.3.4.26 PoliomyelitisPoliomyelitis 176 Immunisation against Disease 177I 26.3.4 The contacts of a recently immunised baby should be advised of the need for strict personal hygiene, particularly for washing theirhands after changing the baby's napkins. Unimmunised adults can be immunised at the same time as their children (see 26.5). There is no need to boost previously immunised individuals. I 26.3.5 Babies in Special Care Units should be given IPV whilst remaining in the Unit, or alternatively, be given OPV at the time ofdischarge. Where IPV has been given, immunisation can be completedsubsequently with OPV. I 26.3.6 Recently immunised children may be taken swimming, even if they have been given OPV. Similarly, there is no risk of an unimmunisedchild contracting vaccine associated poliomyelitis from a recentlyimmunised child if they are taken swimming. In such public places, caremust be taken to dispose of soiled napkins without contaminatingfacilities that others might use. I 26.4 Reinforcing immunisation in children A reinforcing dose of oral poliomyelitis vaccine (OPV) should be given before school entry at the same time as the reinforcing dose of diphtheria and tetanusvaccine; a further dose of OPV should be given at 15-19 years of age beforeleaving school. I 26.5 Immunisation of adults I 26.5.1 A course of three doses of OPV at intervals of four weeks is recommended for the primary immunisation of adults. No adult should remain unimmunised against poliomyelitis (see 26.1.3). I 26.5.2 Reinforcing doses for adults are not necessary unless they are at special risk, such as: a. Travellers to areas or countries where poliomyelitis is epidemic or endemic. (See 'Health Information for Overseas Travel' 1995 Edition). b. Health care workers in possible contact with poliomyelitis cases.I 26.5.3 Health care workers requiring polio vaccine, either for primary immunisation or for boosting prior to travel to a polio infectedcountry, may be given OPV. They must be reminded of the need forstrict personal hygiene, especially if their work brings them into contactwith immunosuppressed individuals. There is no known case ofnosocomial vaccine related contact poliomyelitis involving a health careworker and an immunosuppressed patient. I 26.5.4 For those exposed to a continuing risk of infection, a single reinforcing dose is desirable every ten years. I 26.6 Polio vaccines and immunocompromised individuals I 26.6.1 Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is available for the immunisation of individuals for whom a live vaccine is contraindicated(see 7.3 and 7.4). It should also be used for siblings and otherhousehold contacts of immunosuppressed individuals. A primary courseof three doses of 0.5ml with intervals of one month should be given bysubcutaneous injection and can be given from 2 months of age. Acourse started with OPV can be completed or reinforced with IPV andvice versa. Reinforcing doses should be given as for OPV. I 26.6.2 HIV positive asymptomatic individuals may receive live polio vaccine but excretion of the vaccine virus in the faeces may continue forlonger than in normal individuals. Household contacts should bewarned of this and reminded of the need for strict personal hygiene,including hand-washing after nappy changes for an HIV positive infant. I 26.6.3 For HIV positive symptomatic individuals, IPV may be used instead of OPV at the discretion of the clinician. I 26.7 Adverse reactions I 26.7.1 Cases of vaccine-associated poliomyelitis have been reported in recipients of OPV and in contacts of recipients. In England and Walesthere is an annual average of one recipient and one contact case inrelation to over two million doses of oral vaccine. Contact cases wouldbe eliminated if all children and adults were immunised. The possibilityof a very small risk of poliomyelitis induced by OPV cannot be ignoredbut is insufficient to warrant a change in immunisation policy. The need26 PoliomyelitisPoliomyelitis 178 Immunisation against Infectious DiseasePoliomyelitis26 Poliomyelitis Immunisation against Infectious Disease 179for strict personal hygiene for contacts of recent vaccinees must be stressed. I 26.7.2 Any such cases following immunisation with poliomyelitis vaccine should be reported to the Committee on Safety of Medicinesusing the yellow card system. I 26.8 Contraindications - OPV (i) Acute or febrile illness; immunisation should be postponed. (ii) Vomiting or diarrhoea; should be postponed.(iii) Treatment involving high-dose corticosteroids or immunosuppression including general radiation (see 7.3). (iv) Malignant conditions of the reticulo-endothelial system such as lymphoma, leukaemia, and Hodgkin's disease, and where the normalimmunological mechanism may be impaired as for example, inhypogammaglobulinaemia. (See 7.3). (v) Although adverse effects on the fetus have not been reported, oral polio vaccine should not be given to women during the first four months ofpregnancy unless there are compelling reasons, such as travel to an endemicpoliomyelitis area. I 26.8.1 OPV may be given at the same time as inactivated vaccines and with other live vaccines except oral typhoid vaccine (see 33.6.2).When BCG is given to infants, there is no need to delay the primaryimmunisations which include polio vaccine, because the latter virusesreplicate in the intestine to induce local immunity and serum antibodies,and three doses are given. I 26.8.2 OPV may contain trace amounts of penicillin, neomycin, polymyxin and streptomycin but these do not contraindicate its useexcept in cases of extreme hypersensitivity. I 26.8.3 OPV should not be used for the siblings and other household contacts of immunosuppressed children; such contacts should be givenIPV.I 26.8.4 OPV should be given either three weeks before or three months after an injection of normal immunoglobulin. This may notalways be possible in the case of travellers going abroad, but as in suchcases the OPV is likely to be a booster dose, the possible inhibiting effectof immunoglobulin is less important. I 26.9 Contraindications to IPV (i) Acute or febrile illness; immunisation should be postponed. (ii) IPV may contain trace amounts of polymyxin B and neomycin but these do not contraindicate its use except in cases of extreme hypersensitivity. Itdoes not contain penicillin. I 26.10 Management of outbreaks After a single case of paralytic poliomyelitis from wild virus, a dose of OPV should be given immediately to all persons in the neighbourhood of the case(with the exception of individuals with genuine contraindications such asimmunodeficiency, to whom IPV should be given) regardless of a previoushistory of immunisation against poliomyelitis. In previously unimmunisedindividuals the three dose course must be completed. If there is laboratoryconfirmation that a vaccine-derived polio virus is responsible for the case,immunisation of further possible contacts is unnecessary since no outbreaksassociated with vaccine virus have ever been documented. If the source of theoutbreak is uncertain, it should be assumed to be a 'wild' virus andappropriate control measures instituted. I 26.11 Supplies a.

The incubation period is generally between two andeight weeks, but may range from nine days to two years or more. Theonset of illness is insidious. Early symptoms may include paraesthesiaearound the site of the wound, fever, headache and malaise. The diseasemay then present with spasms, or with hydrophobia, hallucinations andmaniacal behaviour progressing to paralysis and coma, or as anascending flaccid paralysis and sensory disturbance. Rabies is almostalways fatal, death resulting from respiratory paralysis. There is notreatment. I 27.1.2 Infection is usually via the bite of a rabid animal. Rarely, transmission of the virus has occurred through mucous membranes. Itdoes not occur through intact skin. Virus is present in some tissues andfluids of patients with rabies, but person-to-person spread of the diseasehas not been documented with the exception of six cases acquiredthrough corneal grafts. No case of indigenous human rabies has beenreported in the United Kingdom since 1902 although cases occur fromtime to time in persons infected abroad. I 27.1.3 Rabies in animals occurs in all continents except Australasia and Antarctica. Canine rabies is endemic throughout most of Asia,Africa and Latin America. In Europe foxes are the predominant host butmany other animals become infected including dogs and cats, cattle,horses, badgers, martens and deer; mass oral immunisation campaignshave reduced the numbers of reported cases of animal rabies in recentyears. In the United States, rabies in animals has become more prevalentsince the 1950s; skunks, raccoons and bats account for 85% of animalcases. The UK has been free of indigenous animal rabies since 1922apart from the identification of a single rabid bat on the Sussex coast in1996. I 27.2 Vaccine I 27.2.1 Rabies human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV) is a freeze dried suspension of Wistar rabies virus strain PM/WI 38 1503-3M cultured inhuman diploid cells and inactivated by beta-propiolactone. The potencyof the reconstituted vaccine is not less than 2.5 International Units per1ml dose. It contains traces of neomycin.27 RabiesRabies 184 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseI 27.2.2 The freeze dried vaccine should be stored at 2-8\u00b0C and not frozen. It should be used immediately after reconstitution with thediluent supplied and any unused vaccine discarded after one hour. Itmay be given by deep subcutaneous, intramuscular or intradermalinjection (see 27.4.3 and 27.2.3 Rabies-specific immunoglobulin Human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) is obtained from the plasma of immunised human donors. It is used after exposure to rabies to giverapid protection until rabies vaccine, which should be given at the sametime, becomes effective. I 27.3 Recommendations Pre-exposure immunisation with human diploid cell rabies vaccine should be offered, and is available free from the NHS, to: a. Laboratory workers handling the virus.b. Those who, in the course of their work, regularly handle imported animals e.g. at animal quarantine centres at zoos at research and acclimatisation centres where primates and other imported animals are housed at ports e.g. certain Customs and Excise officers carrying agents authorised to carry imported animals veterinary and technical staff at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF), the Scottish Office, Agriculture,Environment and Fisheries Department, (SOAEFD) and theDepartment of Agriculture for Northern Ireland (DANI). inspectors appointed by local authorities under the Diseases of Animals Act. (This does not include all local authority dogwardens for whom the risk of exposure is low and for whom postexposure prophylaxis in the event of an incident is likely to bemore appropriate.) c. Licensed bat handlersRabies27 Rabies Immunisation against Infectious Disease 185d. Workers in enzootic areas abroad who by the nature of their work are at special risk of contact with rabid animals (e.g. veterinary staff orzoologists). e. Health workers who are likely to come into close contact with a patient with rabies. I 27.3.2 Pre-exposure immunisation is also recommended for those living or travelling in enzootic areas who may be exposed to unusual riskof being infected or are undertaking especially long journeys in remoteparts where medical treatment may not be immediately available. (Moredetailed country by country advice is contained in the UK HealthDepartments' book 'Health Information for Overseas Travel'). For theseindividuals, the vaccine is not supplied free from the NHS. I 27.4 Route of administration and dosage I 27.4.1 For primary pre-exposure protection, three doses of 1.0ml of HDCV should be given, on days 0, 7 and 28, by deep subcutaneous orintramuscular injection in the deltoid region. (The antibody responsemay be reduced if the gluteal region is used.) I 27.4.2 For travellers who are not animal handlers, two doses of 1.0ml by deep subcutaneous or intramuscular injection four weeks apartcan be expected to give immunity in 98% of recipients and may beacceptable if post exposure treatment is likely to be readily available.For those at continued exposure a further dose should be given 6-12months later. I 27.4.3 Use of the intradermal route: When more than one person is to be immunised, the vaccine may be administered in smaller doses(0.1ml) by the intradermal route in either of the above schedules. Theintradermal route may also be used for rapid immunisation of, forexample, staff caring for a patient with rabies, giving 0.1ml of vaccineintradermally into each limb (0.4ml in all) on the first day of exposure tothe patient. Intradermal immunisation is reliable only if the whole of the 0.1ml dose is properly given into the dermis and should only be given bythose experienced in the intradermal technique. It should not be used inthose taking chloroquine for malaria prophylaxis as this suppresses theantibody response. The use of the intradermal route is on the doctor'sown responsibility as this is not covered by the manufacturer's ProductLicence.I 27.4.4 Reinforcing doses: Where post-exposure treatment is readily available, as in the UK, reinforcing doses are not normally required forindividuals who have received three doses of vaccine unless exposureoccurs (when post exposure treatment should be given) or unlessexposure is regular and continuous (e.g. laboratory workers handling thevirus, licensed bat handlers). I 27.4.5 For those at regular and continuous risk in the UK, and where post-exposure treatment is not readily available and there iscontinued risk, single reinforcing doses of vaccine should be given at twoto three year intervals, the interval to be reviewed after 2-3 reinforcingdoses (but see 27.4.6 and 27.5.1). I 27.4.6 The three dose primary pre-exposure course produces protective antibody in virtually 100% of recipients and makes routinepost-immunisation serological testing unnecessary. Serological testing isadvised for those who work with live virus. They should have theirantibodies tested every six months, and be given reinforcing doses ofvaccine as necessary to maintain protective levels. Serological testing isotherwise only advised for those who have had a severe reaction to aprevious dose of vaccine to confirm the need for a reinforcing dose. I 27.4.7 All travellers to enzootic areas should also be informed by their medical advisers of the practical steps to be taken if an animal biteis sustained (see 27.4.8). I 27.4.8 Post exposure treatment In the event of possible exposure, firstly, as soon as possible after the incident, the wound should be thoroughly cleansed by scrubbing withsoap and water under a running tap for five minutes. Secondly, thename and address of the owner of the animal should be obtained andthe animal observed for ten days to see if it begins to behave abnormally.If necessary, the assistance of local officials should be sought. Thirdly,advice should be taken from a local doctor. If the animal is wild or astray and observation is impossible, the doctor will know if rabies occursin the locality and if immunisation is advised. 27 RabiesRabies 186 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseRabies27 Rabies Immunisation against Infectious Disease 187I 27.4.9 For travellers returning to this country who report an exposure (break in skin or contamination of mucosal surface) to ananimal abroad, treatment, including cleaning the wound as above,should be started as soon as possible while enquiries are made about theprevalence of rabies in the country concerned and, where possible, theownership and condition of the biting animal. Information should besought from the PHLS Virus Reference Division, London (0181-2004400); in Scotland, the Scottish Centre for Infection and EnvironmentalHealth (0141-946 7120); in Northern Ireland, the Public HealthLaboratory, Belfast City Hospital (01232 329241). I 27.4.10 Subsequent treatment will depend on the risk of rabies in the country concerned and the immune status of the individual, and each incident has to be judged on its merits. Points to consider include if theanimal is indigenous (native) or not, its behaviour, the site and severityof bite and whether the bite was provoked. I 27.4.11 Summary of post-exposure prophylaxis: *persons who have been immunised by the intradermal route, or who have received fewer than 3 doses of vaccine, or whose last dose ofvaccine was given more than 2 years previously. I 27.4.12 NO RISK: generally no rabies post exposure prophylaxis needed, however each incident needs to be judged separately (see27.4.10).Rabies risk in country Unimmunised/incompletely Fully immunised of incident immunised individual* individual No Risk (27.4.13) None NoneLow Risk (27.4.15) 5 doses HDCV 2 doses HDCVHigh Risk (27.4.17) 5 doses HDCV plus 2 doses HDCV human rabies specific immunoglobulinI 27.4.13 The following countries are considered 'no risk': Europe: Cyprus, Faroe Is, Finland, Gibraltar, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Malta, Norway (mainland), Mainland Spain exc N.African coast, Sweden, United Kingdom, Portugal, Italy (except the Northern & Eastern borders).

Vaccine must be given by deep subcutaneous or intramuscular injection into the deltoid region (not gluteal) or, in a child, the anterolateral aspectof the thigh. I 27.4.15 The following countries are considered low risk: France, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Switzerland, Denmark, USA and Canada. If the animal can be reliably observed and remains well for 10 days, immunisation may not be required.27 RabiesRabies 188 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseRabies27 Rabies Immunisation against Infectious Disease 189I 27.4.16 HIGH RISK a.

I 27.4.17 Countries considered high risk are: Parts of Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam. Alsomost other countries in Asia, Africa and South America. I 27.4.18 Up to date advice should be obtained from the Virus Reference Division, Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, London(0181-200 4400) or in Scotland from the Scottish Centre for Infectionand Environmental Health (0141 946 7120) as the country-by-countryrisk groups may change. I 27.4.19 Human rabies is a notifiable disease. In the event of a case of human rabies, the Consultant in Communicable Disease Control (inScotland, the Chief Administrative Medical Officer) should be informed. I 27.5 Adverse reactions I 27.5.1 HDCV may cause local reactions such as redness, swelling or pain at the site of injection within 24-48 hours of administration.Systemic reactions such as headache, fever, muscle aches, vomiting, andurticarial rashes have been reported. Anaphylactic shock has beenreported from the USA and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome from Norway.Reactions may become more severe with repeated doses.I 27.5.2 HRIG may cause local pain and low grade fever but no serious adverse reactions have been reported. I 27.5.3 Suspected adverse reactions should be reported to the Committee on Safety of Medicines using the yellow card system. I 27.6 Contraindications I 27.6.1 There are no absolute contraindications to HDCV, although if there is evidence of hypersensitivity, subsequent doses should not begiven except for post-exposure treatment. I 27.6.2 Pre-exposure vaccine should only be given to pregnant women if the risk of exposure to rabies is high. I 27.7 Supplies I 27.7.1 Human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV) is available from (Tel. 01628 773200). HDCV for pre-exposure immunisation of those at occupational risk is available from the PHLS Virus Reference Division, Tel. 0181-200 4400.For others, it can be obtained through local pharmacies by privateprescription.

In theUK, young men are most commonly affected (see 22.1.22). It causes atransient erythematous rash, lymphadenopathy involving post-auricularand sub-occipital glands and occasionally in adults, arthritis andarthralgia. Clinical diagnosis is unreliable since the symptoms are oftenfleeting and can be caused by other viruses; in particular the rash is notdiagnostic of rubella. A history of rubella should therefore not be accepted without serological evidence of previous infection. The incubation period is 14-21 days, and the period of infectivity is from oneweek before until four days after the onset of rash. I 28.1.2 Maternal rubella infection in the first eight to ten weeks of pregnancy results in fetal damage in up to 90% of infants and multipledefects are common: the Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS). The riskof damage declines to about 10-20% by 16 weeks; after this stage ofpregnancy fetal damage is rare. Fetal defects include mental handicap,cataract, deafness, cardiac abnormalities, retardation of intra-uterinegrowth, and inflammatory lesions of brain, liver, lungs and bone-marrow.Any combination of these defects may occur; the only defects whichcommonly occur alone are perceptive deafness and pigmentaryretinopathy following infection after the first eight weeks of pregnancy.Some infected infants may appear normal at birth but perceptive deafnessmay be detected later. In 1995, there were only 8 laboratory confirmedrubella infections in pregnant women, reported to CDSC, compared with164 in 1987. Rubella associated terminations of pregnancy fell from over750 in 1972 to 22 in 1993. Since the introduction of MMR vaccine, CRScases, reported to the National Congenital Rubella SurveillanceProgramme, have fallen to around 5 cases annually.28 RubellaRubella 194 Immunisation against Infectious Disease80010001200 600 200400 0 1971 1976 1981 1986 1991YearsNumbers Numbersdue to disease/contact due to immunisation 6080 40 20 0 1971 1976 1981 1986 1991 Years Source: National Congenital Rubella Surveillance ProgrammeRubella terminations due to disease/contact or immunisation, reported to ONS.

England Immunisation Disease 195I 28.1.3 Rubella was made a notifiable disease in the UK in 1988. For notification of cases of CRS (see 28.10). I 28.1.4 Confirmation of rubella infection in pregnant women Because the rash is not diagnostic and also because infection can occur with no clinical symptoms, acute rubella can only be confirmed by laboratory tests. I 28.1.5 Investigation of pregnant women exposed to rubella All pregnant women with suspected rubella or exposed to rubella must be investigated serologically, irrespective of a history of immunisation,clinical rubella or a previous positive rubella antibody result. As soon as possible after the exposure to rubella, a blood sample should be taken and sent to the laboratory with date of LMP and date of exposure. Close collaboration between virologists and clinicians isessential for the accurate interpretation of serological results. Further specimens may be needed based on the initial results. I 28.1.6 As some patients may have more than one exposure to a person with a rubella like illness, or because exposure may occur over aprolonged period, it is important to know the dates of the first and lastexposures. I 28.1.7 Confirmation of acute rubella infection is recommended in all suspected cases. Saliva samples are appropriate for children butserological samples are essential for pregnant women. Either techniquecan be used for non-pregnant women and all men; the most convenienttest should be used. I 28.2 Rubella vaccine I 28.2.1 The rubella virus was isolated in cell cultures in 1962. Vaccines are prepared from strains of attenuated virus and have beenlicensed in the UK since 1970. All rubella vaccine used in the UKcontains the Wistar RA 27/3 strain grown in human diploid cells (see2.7).I 28.2.2 Rubella vaccine is a freeze dried preparation. It must be protected from light, stored in the dried state at 2-8\u00b0C (not frozen) andreconstituted with the diluent fluid supplied by the manufacturer; it mustbe used within one hour of reconstitution. I 28.2.3 One dose of vaccine produces an antibody response in over 95% of vaccinees; there is no evidence that protection followingimmunisation wanes with time. In girls who were among the first to beimmunised in the UK in 1968, vaccine-induced antibody has shown littledecline. In countries where rubella is no longer endemic, vaccine-inducedantibody has been shown to persist for at least 18 years. Protectionagainst clinical rubella appears to be long-term even in the presence ofdeclining antibody. I 28.2.4 Rubella re-infection can occur in individuals with both natural and vaccine-induced antibody. Occasional cases of CRS afterreinfection in pregnancy have been reported; although the risk to thefetus cannot be quantified precisely, it is considered to be low. I 28.2.5 Susceptible pregnant women will continue to be at risk of rubella infection in pregnancy until the transmission of rubella virus isinterrupted. This will occur when the present school population reachesadulthood (see 22.1.23). I 28.2.6 The vaccine virus is not transmitted from vaccinees to susceptible contacts. Thus there is no risk to pregnant women fromcontact with recently immunised individuals. I 28.3 Route of administration and dosage For both children and adults the dose is 0.5ml given by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. I 28.4 Recommendations (and see Chapter 22) I 28.4.1 All boys and girls should be immunised with rubella containing vaccine (MMR) at 12 - 15 months and again at approximately4 years. A history of rubella should be disregarded because of theunreliability of diagnosis. Young people of either sex, attending for theirschool-leaving Td and polio immunisations should be offered MMRvaccine if they have not previously had rubella (or measles) 28 RubellaRubella 196 against Infectious Disease 197I 28.4.2 Immigrants who have entered the UK after the age of school immunisation are particularly likely to require immunisation.Approximately two in five of the children currently born with congenitalrubella syndrome are of Asian origin. I 28.4.3 General practitioners are uniquely placed to ensure that all women of child-bearing age have been screened for rubella antibody andimmunised where necessary with single antigen rubella vaccine.Opportunities for screening also arise during ante-natal care, and atfamily planning, infertility and occupational health clinics. In such casesgeneral practitioners must be informed of the results. Every effort mustbe made to identify and immunise sero-negative women. All women should be informed of the result of their antibody test and be givenevidence that rubella immunisation has been given. I 28.4.4 Serological testing of non-pregnant women should be performed whenever possible before immunisation but need not beundertaken where this might interfere with the acceptance or delivery ofvaccine. Pregnancy should be avoided for one month. I 28.4.5 Women should be screened for rubella antibodies at least in the first pregnancy,irrespective of a previous positive rubella antibodyresult. Very occasionally, laboratory errors or errors during reportingmay result in patients who are sero-negative being reported as sero-positive. When there are documented results available of two tests usinga specific method, both confirming the presence of rubella antibody, thenfurther screening in pregnancy is unnecessary, unless contact withsuspected rubella or a rubella-like rash occurs. I 28.4.6 Women found to be seronegative on ante-natal screening should be immunised after delivery and before discharge from thematernity unit. If anti-D immunoglobulin is required, the two may begiven at the same time in different sites with separate syringes. While ithas now been established that anti-D immunoglobulin does not interferewith the antibody response to vaccine, blood transfusion does inhibit theresponse in up to 50% of vaccinees. In such cases a test for antibodyshould be performed eight weeks later, with re-immunisation if necessary.If rubella vaccine is not given post-partum before discharge, the generalpractitioner must be informed of the need for this. Alternatively it can be given at the post-natal visit. All women found on antenatal screening to be susceptible to rubella should be immunised after delivery, before thenext pregnancy.I 28.4.7 To avoid the risk of transmitting rubella to pregnant patients, all health service staff, both male and female, should be screened and those seronegative immunised with rubella vaccine. I 28.4.8 Rubella vaccine maybe given to HIV positive individuals in the absence of contraindications. I 28.5 Immunisation in pregnancy: I 28.5.1 Because of the known association between wild rubella virus and CRS, there were concerns that the attenuated vaccine virus couldcarry this risk. Active surveillance in USA, UK and Germany has foundno case of Congenital Rubella Syndrome following inadvertentimmunisation shortly before or during pregnancy. There is no evidencethat the vaccine is teratogenic. I 28.5.2 Termination of pregnancy following immunisation should therefore notbe recommended. The potential parents should be given this information before considering termination. I 28.5.3 As with any live viral vaccine however, immunisation of pregnant women should be avoided where feasible (see 7.2.3). I 28.5.4 Pregnant women who are found to be susceptible to rubella should be immunised after delivery. I 28.5.5 Enquiring about the date of the last menstrual period is not necessary as it would not prevent immunisation being given just beforeconception occurs, nor would it prevent immunisation in the early stagebefore pregnancy is recognised, but see 28.7. I 28.6 Adverse reactions I 28.6.1 Mild reactions such as fever, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, rash, arthralgia and arthritis may occur following immunisation.Symptoms usually begin one to three weeks after immunisation and aretransient; joint symptoms are more common in women than in younggirls. One recent retrospective case control study showed no increase inarthropathy (arthritis and arthralgia) in women immunised post-partumcompared with Infectious Disease 199Thrombocytopenia, usually self-limiting, has occasionally been reported after rubella immunisation. Very rarely neurological symptoms have beenreported but a causal relationship has not been established. I 28.6.2 Serious reactions following rubella immunisation should be reported to the Committee on Safety of Medicines using the yellow cardsystem. I 28.7 Contraindications (i) Rubella vaccine should not be given to a woman known to be pregnant, and pregnancy should be avoided for one month after immunisation. (ii) Immunisation should be postponed if the patient is suffering from a febrile illness until recovery is complete. (iii) The vaccine should not be administered to patients receiving high dose corticosteroids or immunosuppressive treatment including general radiation; orto those suffering from malignant conditions of the reticulo-endothelial systemsuch as lymphoma, leukaemia, Hodgkin's disease or where the normalimmunological mechanism may be impaired as, for example, inhypogammaglobulinaemia (see 7.3). (iv) If it is necessary to administer more than one live virus vaccine at the same time, these may be given simultaneously at different sites unless acombined preparation is used. If not given simultaneously they should beseparated by an interval of at least three weeks (but see 7.5). A three weekinterval should be allowed between the administration of rubella vaccine andBCG. (v) Rubella vaccine should not be given within three months of an injection of immunoglobulin. (vi) Rubella vaccines contain traces of neomycin and/or polymyxin. Previous anaphylactic reaction to these substances contraindicate rubella immunisation. I 28.8 Supplies Freeze-dried live vaccine manufactured either by Evans or SmithKline Beecham and containing the Wistar RA 27/3 strain, is available fromFarillon (Tel 01708 379000) or Scottish Health Care Supplies for use inchildhood immunisation programmes and for adult women. I 28.9 Human normal immunoglobulin (HNIG) Post-exposure prophylaxis with immunoglobulin does notprevent infection in non-immune contacts and is therefore of little value for protection ofpregnant women exposed to rubella. It may however reduce the likelihoodof clinical symptoms which may possibly reduce the risk to the fetus. Itshould only be used if termination for confirmed rubella would beunacceptable when it should be given soon after exposure; serologicalfollow-up of recipients is essential. Dose: 750mg For supplies see 19.3. I 28.10 Surveillance of CRS and rubella immunisation in pregnancy I 28.10.1 Congenital Rubella Syndrome has been included amongst the rare diseases monitored by the British Paediatric AssociationSurveillance Unit (BPASU) which sends monthly enquiries topaediatricians, who should report CRS on the monthly cards. I 28.10.2 Clinicians who do not return information on CRS to BPASU should report any child with congenital rubella defects, orwith suggestive of congenital rubella, or of infection without symptoms to the NationalCongenital Rubella Programme: Ms Pat Tookey National Congenital is also investigating the effects of rubella immunisation in pregnancy. If a woman is given rubella vaccine in pregnancy, orbecomes pregnant within one month of immunisation, the Departmentshould be notified as soon as possible. Arrangements will then be madefor the appropriate clinical and virological examination of the new-borninfant, and for subsequent follow-up.

There is thus no indication for smallpox vaccination for any individual with the exception of some laboratory staff and specific workers at identifiable risk(12.17). I 29.2 Recommendations Workers in laboratories where pox viruses (such as vaccinia) are handled, and others whose work involves an identifiable risk of exposure to pox virus,should be advised of the possible risk and vaccination should be considered.Detailed guidance for laboratory staff has been prepared by the AdvisoryCommittee on Dangerous Pathogens and the Advisory Committee on GeneticModification (see 29.3). Further advice on the need for vaccination andcontraindications should be obtained from the Public Health LaboratoryService Virus Reference Division (Tel 0181 200 4400); if vaccination isconsidered desirable, vaccine can be obtained through PHLS on this number.In Scotland, advice can be obtained from the Scottish Centre for Infection andEnvironmental Health (Tel. 0141 946 7120).

It is induced by the toxin oftetanus bacilli which grow anaerobically at the site of an injury. Theincubation period is between four and 21 days, commonly about ten.Tetanus spores are present in soil and may be introduced into the bodyduring injury, often through a puncture wound, but also through burnsor trivial, unnoticed wounds. Neonatal tetanus due to infection of thebaby's umbilical stump is an important cause of death in many countriesin Asia and Africa. Turkey is the only remaining country reporting casesin the European region. World-wide elimination of neonatal tetanus bythe year 1995 was one of the World Health Organisation targets and thenumber of countries is progressively increasing in which neonatal tetanusno longer occurs. Tetanus can never be eradicated. Tetanus is notspread from person to person. I 30.1.2 Effective protection against tetanus is provided by active immunisation which was introduced in some localities as part of theprimary immunisation of infants from the mid 1950s and nationallyfrom 1961. Tetanus immunisation was provided by the Armed Forcesfrom 1938. In 1970 it was recommended in the UK that activeimmunisation should be routinely provided in the treatment of wounds,when immunisation against tetanus should be initiated if appropriate,and subsequently completed. I 30.1.3 Between 1984 and 1995 there were 145 cases of tetanus (notifications, deaths and laboratory reports) in England and Wales.75% occurred in individuals over 45 years and of the remainder, 16%were in individuals from 25 to 44 years. 53% of all cases were inindividuals over 65 years, two thirds of them being in women. Thus, thehighest risk groups are the elderly with women being at greater risk thanmen.30 TetanusTetanus 206 Immunisation against Infectious Disease 1969 1979 1984 1989 1994 1974 Years30 2025 51015 0Female Male60 25-44 45-64 65+Total AgesTetanus by age and sex (all sources) England and Wales (1985-1995)NotificationsTetanus notification to ONS England and Wales (1969-1995)Tetanus30 Tetanus Immunisation against Infectious Disease 207I 30.2 Tetanus vaccine and adsorbed tetanus vaccine Immunisation protects by stimulating the production of antitoxin which in turn provides immunity against the effects of the toxin. The immunogen isprepared by treating a cell-free preparation of toxin with formaldehyde andthereby converting it into the innocuous tetanus toxoid. This however is arelatively poor immunogen, and for use as a vaccine it is usually adsorbed ontoan adjuvant, either aluminium phosphate or aluminium hydroxide. Bordetella pertussis vaccine also acts as an effective adjuvant. The recommended vaccines for immunisation are:Adsorbed tetanus (T). Adsorbed diphtheria/tetanus (DT). Adsorbed tetanus vaccine for adults (Td). Adsorbed diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis (DTP) . Plain vaccines are no longer supplied as they are less immunogenic and have no advantage in terms of reaction rates. Vaccines should be stored at 2-8\u00b0C. Protect from light. Do not freeze.Disposal should be by incineration at not less than 1100\u00b0C at a registered waste disposal contractor. The dose is 0.5ml given by intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injection.I 30.3 Recommendations I 30.3.1 For immunisation of infants and children under ten years. a. Primary immunisation Triple vaccine, that is, vaccine containing diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, and Bordetella pertussis (DTP), is recommended for infants from two months of age. Adsorbed DTP vaccine is used as it has been shownto cause fewer reactions than plain vaccine. If the pertussis componentis contraindicated, adsorbed diphtheria/tetanus vaccine should be given.A primary course of immunisation consists of three doses starting at twomonths with an interval of one month between each dose (see 11.1). If a course is interrupted it may be resumed; there is no need to start again,whatever the interval. The dose is 0.5ml given by intramuscular or deepsubcutaneous injection. b. Reinforcing doses in children A booster dose of adsorbed diphtheria/tetanus (DT) should be given at least three years after the final dose of the primary course. If theprimary course is only completed at school entry, then the booster doseshould be given three years later. A further reinforcing dose of tetanusand low dose diphtheria vaccine (Td) is recommended for those aged 13-18 years or before leaving school. Teenagers being treated for tetanus prone wounds and who had received their fourth dose of tetanus vaccineapproximately ten years earlier, should be given Td vaccine and theschool leaving dose omitted. I 30.3.2 Children given DTP at monthly intervals for primary immunisation, without a booster dose at 18 months, have been shown tohave adequate antibody levels at school entry. A booster dose at 18months is therefore not recommended.30 TetanusTetanus 208 Immunisation against Infectious Tetanus Immunisation against Infectious Disease 209I 30.3.3 For immunisation of adults and children over ten years Adults most likely to be susceptible to tetanus are the elderly, especially women and men who have not served in the Armed Forces. a. For primary immunisation the course consists of three doses of 0.5ml of adsorbed tetanus vaccine (T) by intramuscular or deep subcutaneousinjection, with intervals of one month between each dose. If there is norecord of diphtheria immunisation either, then three doses of Td vaccineshould be given. b. A reinforcing dose (T or Td) ten years after the primary course and again ten years later maintains satisfactory levels of protection whichwill probably be life-long. c. For immunised adults who have received five doses, either in childhood, or as above, booster doses are not recommended, other thanat the time of tetanus prone injury, since they have been shown to beunnecessary and can cause considerable local reactions. There are datathat show that tetanus has occurred only exceptionally rarely in fullyimmunised individuals despite the passage of many years since thecompleting dose of a standard course of immunisation, and withoutsubsequent routine boosting. Cases that have occurred were not fatal.There is therefore little justification for boosting with tetanus vaccinebeyond the recommended 5 dose regimen. I 30.3.4 Treatment of patients with tetanus-prone wounds The following are considered tetanus-prone wounds: a. Any wound or burn sustained more than six hours before surgical treatment of the wound or burn. b. Any wound or burn at any interval after injury that shows one or more of the following characteristics: (i) A significant degree of devitalised tissue.(ii) Puncture-type wound.(iii) Contact with soil or manure likely to harbour tetanus organisms. (iv) Clinical evidence of sepsis.Thorough surgical toilet of the wound is essential whatever the tetanus immunisation history of the patient. Specific anti-tetanus prophylaxis is as follows:30 TetanusTetanus 210 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseImmunisation status Type Of Wound Type of Wound Clean Tetanus Prone Last of 3 dose course, Nil.

After a tetanus-prone injury such individuals will thereforerequire a full course of immunisation unless it has previously been given,as for instance in the armed services. I 30.3.6 Immunised individuals respond rapidly to a subsequent single injection of adsorbed tetanus vaccine, even after an interval of years. I 30.3.7 For wounds not in the above categories, such as clean cuts, antitetanus immunoglobulin should notbe given. I 30.3.8 Patients with impaired immunity who suffer a tetanus-prone wound may not respond to vaccine and may therefore require antitetanusimmunoglobulin (see 7.3 and 30.7) in addition. I 30.3.9 HIV positive individuals should be immunised against tetanus in the absence of contraindications (see 7.4 and 30.7). I 30.4 Adverse reactions I 30.4.1 Local reactions, such as pain, redness and swelling round the injection site may occur and persist for several days. General reactions,which are uncommon, include headache, lethargy, malaise, myalgia andpyrexia. Acute anaphylactic reactions and urticaria may occasionallyoccur and, rarely, peripheral neuropathy. Persistent nodules at theinjection site may arise if the injection is not given deeply enough. I 30.4.2 Severe or unusual reactions should be reported to the Committee on Safety of Medicines using the yellow card system. I 30.5 Contraindications a. Tetanus vaccine should not be given to an individual suffering from acute febrile illness except in the presence of a tetanus-prone wound. Minorinfections without fever or systemic upset are not reasons to postponeimmunisation.b. Immunisation should not proceed in individuals who have had an anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose. A large study of individuals (740)with histories of reactions after tetanus immunisation showed that tetanusimmunisation could be completed and none of the patients, whenchallenged, suffered an adverse reaction. The authors conclude that anadverse reaction to tetanus toxoid does not preclude future immunisationwith this same material. If this is to be done in patients with a history ofan adverse reaction to a previous dose, then it is best preformed in a settingwhere there are facilities to deal with any acute allergic reactions.

InSweden, 10-15% of adults with the illness are reported to develop paresisduring the acute phase and recovery may be slow. The case fatality is around1%. The disease is endemic in forested parts of Europe and Scandinavia,especially where there is heavy undergrowth, the greatest risk being in latespring and summer when ticks are active. The virus is maintained in nature insmall mammals, domestic livestock and certain species of birds. I 31.2 Vaccine I 31.2.1 An unlicensed vaccine is available on a named patient basis. It is an inactivated whole cell virus vaccine containing a suspension ofpurified TBE virus grown in chick embryo cells and inactivated with for-malin. It contains thiomersal as preservative. The vaccine should bestored between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C. Freezing or storage at a higher temperaturemust be avoided. I 31.2.2 An immunoglobulin preparation is also available for post- exposure prophylaxis. I 31.3 Recommendations I 31.3.1 The vaccine is recommended for travellers who are to walk, camp or work in late spring and summer in warm heavily forested partsof Central and Eastern Europe and Scandinavia, especially if there isheavy undergrowth. I 31.3.2 Protection is also afforded by covering arms, legs and ankles and using insect repellents on socks and outer clothes. These measures areadvised whether or not vaccine is given. I 31.4 Route of administration and dosage I 31.4.1 Two doses of 0.5ml (irrespective of age) given 4-12 weeks apart will give protection for one year. The injections must be givenintramuscularly.31 Tick borne encephalitisTick borne encephalitis 216 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseI 31.4.2 A third dose 9-12 months after the second gives three years protection. A further booster dose can be given up to six years later forlonger protection.I 31.4.3 Booster doses are recommended at 3 yearly intervals for those at continued risk. I 31.5 Adverse reactions I 31.5.1 Reported reactions to tick-borne encephalitis vaccine are very rare. Local reactions at the immunisation site and some locallymphadenopathy may occur. Febrile reactions in children are describedafter the first dose. I 31.5.2 General reactions such as fatigue, limb pain, fever, nausea and headache lasting up to 24 hours may occur occasionally and atransient pruritic rash may rarely occur. I 31.5.3 Neurological symptoms have occurred on rare occasions following administration of the vaccine. I 31.6 Contraindications Allergy to the preservative thiomersal and to egg protein are contraindications.I 31.7 Supplies Both the vaccine and the immunoglobulin preparation are available from Immuno Limited (Telephone 01732-458101). The vaccine is supplied in pre-loaded syringes, each syringe containing a single dose of 0.5ml. Theimmunoglobulin is supplied in single vials of 1, 2 and 5ml. I 31.8 Bibliography Tick borne Disease 217Prevalence of antibodies against tick-borne among residents D, 15-16 and of a highly purified TUBERCULOSIS: BCG IMMUNISATION Please note that this chapter is arranged differently from other chapters in this book. For ease of reference, it is divided into three sections: i. BCG immunisation policy (paragraphs 32.1 to 32.4)ii. 32.1 Introduction I 32.1.1 Human tuberculosis is caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. bovis or M. africanum and may affect any part of the body. In the UK, about 75% of new cases involve therespiratory system; non-respiratory forms are more common inimmigrant ethnic groups and in those with impaired immunity.Tuberculosis is most commonly acquired by aerosol spread; suchtransmission is only likely when the index case is sputum smear-positivefor the bacillus, and after prolonged close contact. I 32.1.2 Notifications of tuberculosis in the UK declined tenfold between 1948 and 1987, although high immigration levels, particularlyfrom the Indian subcontinent (ISC), slowed the decline in the late 1960s.The decline stopped in 1987, and in recent years small year on yearincreases have occurred to 6,528 in 1993 (the provisional total for 1994is 6229, and for 1995, 6249). The incidence varies widely between areasand between ethnic groups, but is generally higher in inner city areas andin groups of the population originating from high risk areas or situations(eg ISC, Africa, refugees). HIV infection, although undoubtedly a riskfactor for tuberculosis, is not thought to have contributed significantly tothe recent increases in notifications in the UK. Mortality from tuberculosisdecreased rapidly after the introduction of effective chemotherapy. Inrecent years about 400 deaths a year have been attributed to tuberculosisin England and Wales. Drug resistant tuberculosis is uncommon in theUK, but has increased slightly in recent years.32 Tuberculosis: BCG immunisationTuberculosis: BCG immunisation 220 Immunisation against Infectious Disease 60 40 20 0 1940 1945 1950 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 YearsNotifications DeathsThousands1975 1980 1985 1990 1995024681012Thousands YearsNotifications of tuberculosis and deaths to ONS (1940-1995)Tuberculosis: BCG immunisation32 Tuberculosis: vaccine I 32.2.1 BCG vaccine a live attenuated strain derived from Mycobacterium bovis . Two preparations are available: one for intradermal administration, containing 8-26 million colony forming unitsper 10 dose vial, and one for percutaneous use containing 50-250 millioncolony forming units per vial. The latter is for use only in infants when using the multiple puncture technique . Both preparations are available freeze-dried in rubber-capped vials with diluent in a separate ampoule. I 32.2.2 The vaccine has been shown to have an efficacy in protecting against tuberculosis of 70-80% when given to British schoolchildren,protection lasting at least 15 years. I 32.2.3 BCG vaccine was introduced for general use in the UK in 1953. A national immunisation programme was then started with theaim of immunising all children at age 13 before they left school. By1958, 35% of children in this age cohort had been immunised and by1962, 60%. In recent years about 70% of the target group have beenimmunised each year. National returns suggest about a further 8% wereexempt from immunisation as they were tuberculin positive. Up to50,000 neonates are also now immunised each year in selective neonatalimmunisation programmes. I 32.2.4 Adverse reactions to BCG vaccine are rare if attention is paid to proper selection of subjects and to the techniques for both tuberculintesting and BCG immunisation. All personnel performing these testsmust be properly instructed and observed to be using the correcttechniques. A Department of Health video, for use in teaching sessions,demonstrates the techniques. Copies have been sent to all DistrictImmunisation Coordinators in England and Northern Ireland, and arealso available on free loan (England only) or to buy from the address atthe end of this chapter. I 32.3 Recommendations for immunisation I 32.3.1 The following groups are recommended for immunisation with BCG provided: a. BCG immunisation, as evidenced by the presence of a characteristic scar (see 32.3.4), has not previously been carried out, 32 Tuberculosis: BCG BCG immunisation 222 Immunisation against Infectious Diseaseb. the tuberculin skin test is negative as defined in paragraph 32.16.3 (although babies up to three months of age may be immunised withoutprior skin testing), and c. there are no other contraindications (see 32.4).I 32.3.2 All those at higher risk of tuberculosis: a. Health service staff who may have contact with infectious patients or their specimens. These comprise doctors, nurses, physiotherapists,radiographers, occupational therapists, technical staff in microbiologyand pathology departments including attendants in autopsy rooms,students in all these disciplines, and any others considered to be at highrisk. It is particularly important to test and immunise staff working inmaternity and paediatric departments, and departments in which thepatients are likely to be immunocompromised, eg transplant, oncologyand HIV units. b. Veterinary and other staff who handle animal species known to be susceptible to tuberculosis eg simians. c. Staff of prisons , old people's homes, refugee hostels and hostels for the homeless. d. Contacts of cases known to be suffering from active pulmonary tuberculosis. Contacts of a sputum smear positive index case may have a negative tuberculin skin test when first seen but be in the early stages of infectionbefore tuberculin sensitivity has developed. A further skin test should beperformed six weeks later and immunisation only carried out if thissecond test is negative. (If the second skin test is positive, the patient hasconverted and must be referred for consideration of chemoprophylaxis.)However, if for some reason a further test is impossible, vaccine may begiven after the first test. All HIV positive contacts of a smear positive case should be referred for consideration of chemoprophylaxis. Infants and children who are contacts of a smear positive case: Children under two years of age who have not previously received BCGshould be given chemoprophylaxis even if the skin andTuberculosis: Tuberculosis: appropriate, immunised with BCG on completion of the course. Newly born babies should be given prophylactic isoniazid chemotherapyand tuberculin tested after 3-6 months. If the skin test is positive, chemo-therapy is continued; if negative, BCG vaccine is given provided theinfant is no longer in contact with infectious tuberculosis. It is notnecessary to use isoniazid resistant BCG. Newly born contacts of other cases should be immunised immediately. e. Immigrants from countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, their children and infants wherever born. New entrants to the UK, including students, from countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis (eg the Indian Subcontinent, Africa), and allrefugees and asylum seekers, should be tuberculin skin tested as part ofthe initial screening procedure unless there is definite evidence of a BCG scar. Those with positive reactions should be referred for investigationas they may require chemoprophylaxis or treatment. BCG immunisationshould be offered immediately to those who are tuberculin negative. Infants born subsequently in this country should be immunised within a few days of birth. If this is not done, BCG can conveniently be given attwo months of age at the same time as the first dose of the routinechildhood vaccines. f. Those intending to stay in Asia, Africa, Central or South America for more than a month. I 32.3.3 In addition, the following who are at ' normal ' risk of developing tuberculosis: a. School children between the ages of 10 and 14 years. b. Newly-born babies, children or adults where the parents or the individuals themselves request BCG immunisation. I 32.3.4 Re-immunisation : BCG immunisation results in a characteristic pale, flat, circular scar (thiswill usually be on the upper arm or lateral aspect of the thigh). Subjectswho give a history of previous BCG immunisation should only be re-immunised if there is 32.4.1 BCG vaccine should NOT be given to: a. Patients receiving corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive treatment, including general radiation (see 7.3). Inhaled steroids are nota contraindication. b. Those suffering from a malignant condition such as lymphoma, leukaemia, Hodgkin's disease or other tumour of the reticuloendothelialsystem. c. Those in whom the normal immunological mechanism may be impaired, as in hypogammaglobulinaemia. d. HIV positive individuals (see 7.4). BCG is absolutely contraindicated in symptomatic HIV positive individuals. In countries such as the UKwhere the risk of tuberculosis is low, it is recommended that BCG iswithheld from allsubjects known or suspected to be HIV positive, including infants born to HIV positive mothers. There is no need toscreen mothers for HIV before giving BCG as part of a selective neonatalimmunisation programme (see 32.3.2(e)). e. Pregnant women. Although no harmful effects on the fetus have been observed from BCG immunisation during pregnancy, it is wise to avoidimmunisation in the early stages and if possible to delay until afterdelivery. f. Individuals with positive sensitivity skin tests to tuberculin protein.g. Individuals who are febrile.h. Individuals with generalised septic skin conditions (if eczema exists, an immunisation site should be chosen that is free from skin lesions). I 32.4.2 BCG vaccine may be given concurrently with another live vaccine. If they are not given at the same time, an interval of at leastthree weeks is normally recommended between two live vaccines (basedon experience with live viral vaccines). However, BCG need not delayprimary childhood immunisations even BCG, if indicated, is usually given at birth, but may be given at two months at the same time as other childhoodimmunisations, or at any time up to the age of three months, withoutprior tuberculin testing. I 32.4.4 No further immunisation should be given for at least three months in the arm used for BCG immunisation because of the risk ofregional lymphadenitis THE TUBERCULIN SKIN TEST I 32.5 Introduction A tuberculin skin test must be carried out before BCG immunisation. Theonly exception to this rule is infants up to three months old who may beimmunised without a prior test providing they have had no known recentcontact with tuberculosis. The test assesses the individual's sensitivity totuberculin protein: the greater the strength of the tuberculin reaction the morelikely an individual is to have active disease. People with a positive test shouldnot be given BCG - it is unnecessary and may cause a larger reaction. Thosewith strongly positive tests need to be referred to a chest clinic for assessmentof the need for further investigation and treatment. I 32.6 Tuberculin testing techniques I 32.6.1 There are several techniques for tuberculin skin testing. All the common ones have been considered for their reliability, ease of useand safety and only two are recommended for general use: the Heaf testand the Mantoux test. It is strongly recommended that one of these twotechniques is used. I 32.6.2 The techniques described should be closely adhered to, to minimise variability in the tests. Even so, some tester and readervariation can be expected. I 32.6.3 Both these tests use Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) which users can obtain either from their Health Authority/Health Board free ofcharge (see 32.25) or direct from Farillon (tel 01708 379000). Thevarious preparations of PPD are described in paragraph 32.7. Care must be taken to ensure that the dilution of PPD used is that specified 32.6.4 Careful attention must also be given to the precautions described for each test to prevent any risk of cross-infection. I32.7 Purified protein derivative I 32.7.1 Tuberculin Purified Protein Derivative is a sterile preparation made from the heat-treated products of growth and lysis of themycobacterium. Several strengths of PPD are available and it is veryimportant that the correct solution is used (see table). I 32.7.2 All tuberculin PPD must be stored between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C (never frozen) and protected from light. Once an ampoule is opened, itscontents should be used within four hours and not retained beyond thatsession. PPD tends to adsorb onto syringe surfaces and should thereforebe used within 30 minutes after the syringe is filled. Note that PPD maypersist on the surface of any non-disposable syringe and on the endplateand needles of the standard Heaf gun, both of which need carefulcleaning after use. * For special diagnostic purposes onlyStrength units/ml Dilution of PPD Units in dose of 0.1 ml Use 100,000__10,000 Heaf (multiple puncture) test ONLY 1,000 1 in 100 100 Mantoux test (special)* 100 1 in 1,000 10 Mantoux test (routine) 10 1 in 10,000 The multiple puncture test (Heaf test) I 32.8.1 This test was conventionally performed with a reusable Heaf multiple puncture apparatus (commonly known as a Heaf gun) whichrequires disinfection between subjects. Concern that blood borneinfections such as hepatitis B and HIV might be transferred via thisapparatus should the recommended disinfection procedure not bestrictly adhered to, led to the development of disposable devices. Twoare now available: an apparatus in which disposable heads attach to areusable handle (Bignall 2000, Bignall Surgical Instruments) and a selfcontained single use device (UniHeaf, Owen Mumford). These are nowrecommended as the preferred methods for Heaf testing. They avoid thedisinfection, cleansing and maintenance required for the standard Heafapparatus, eliminate the risk of cross infection between subjects and alsoavoid the possibility of needles becoming blunt and tuberculin buildingup on needles which are reused. They are particularly suitable for theschools BCG programme in which multiple tests are performed in onesession. I 32.8.2 Concentrated PPD 100,000 units/ml is used for the Heaf test. This strength is used only for Heaf testing. It is supplied in packsof five ampoules of 1.0ml, each ampoule normally being sufficient forup to about 20 tests. I 32.9 The disposable head apparatus I 32.9.1 The disposable head attaches by a magnet to a simplified handle. Six standard steel needles are retained in a plastic base which isenclosed in an outer plastic case with holes corresponding to theneedles. The needles protrude only after activation and then remainprotruding so that it is easy to detect and discard ones which have beenfired. The heads are prepacked and sterile. I 32.9.2 There are three versions of the disposable head: i. White - which is the standard version for tuberculin testing in adults and children aged two years and over. The needles protrude 2mm onfiring. ii. Blue - for tuberculin testing in children under two years. The needles protrude 1mm on firing.iii. Red - this version contains 18 needles for administering BCG by the percutaneous multiple puncture technique and must never be used for Heaf testing. I 32.10 The self-contained single use multiple puncture device for Heaf testing: This consists of a sterile single use unit containing six needles which protrude 0.6mm intradermally when the device is activated. The needles permanentlyretract after use so that it cannot be reused. It is notsuitable for use in children under two years of age. I 32.11 The standard reusable Heaf gun I 32.11.1 The apparatus consists of a needle block of six needles attached to a firing mechanism and handle. The six needles are firedthrough corresponding holes in the end plate. I 32.11.2 The puncture depth of the needles is adjustable and should be set to 2mm for adults and children aged two years or more, and 1mmfor children under two years. I 32.12 Disinfection of the Heaf gun I 32.12.1 The gun must be disinfected before every test and at the end of a testing session and it is essential that the user personally observesthis being done. If a sufficient number of spare heads is available, theuse of a replacement autoclaved head for each patient is a satisfactoryalternative. I 32.12.2 The disinfection procedure recommended below is virucidal as long as it is strictly followed. It uses highly flammable spirit andproper precautions are needed to prevent fire hazard. The disinfectionprocedure requires an interval of three minutes or more betweenconsecutive tests with any one instrument. Therefore for immunisationsessions at least three guns should be available for each team and theyshould be disinfected and used in rotation. This will sustain a testingrate of 60 subjects an hour with the required interval disinfectionand cooling.32 Disinfection is a three stage process: a. Soaking in spirit. The end of the instrument is immersed in Industrial Methylated Spirit BP to a depth that totally covers the end plate and theneedles but does not wet the body of the gun (about 1cm). This shouldbe done in a substantial heavy vessel which will support the gun andensure immersion at the correct depth for at least two minutes.Industrial methylated spirit is a colourless preparation containing 95%ethyl alcohol adulterated with wood naphtha which will burn readily.Note that this is a volatile liquid that may create a highly flammablevapour. It should not be left in an open vessel near a naked flame.Mineralised methylated spirits (the violet preparation sold retail forgeneral use) and Surgical Spirit BP contain only 90% alcohol and otheradulterant substances that may inhibit flammability. They are notsuitable. b. Flaming. The gun is withdrawn from the spirit and held at an angle of 45\u00b0 to the vertical with the end plate directed upwards. The spirit is setalight by momentary contact with a flame from which the gun is removedon ignition. The spirit is allowed to burn until the flame goes out. c. Cooling. It is essential to allow adequate time - a minimum of 30 seconds - for the gun to cool, while ensuring that the needles do notbecome contaminated prior to use. I 32.13 Maintenance of the Heaf gun The apparatus requires thorough cleaning after each session. The needles should be scrubbed with a stiff brush using a hot soap or detergentsolution and rinsed with distilled water. The needles must be checked tosee whether they are becoming blunt or slipping in the retaining plate. Itis good practice to replace needles every six months if the gun is inregular use. Periodic servicing by the manufacturer is also recommended. I 32.14 Performing the Heaf test I 32.14.1 The recommended site for testing is on the flexor surface of the left forearm at the junction of the upper third with the lower twothirds, avoiding any eczematous areas. Cleansing the skin is onlynecessary if it is visibly dirty, in which case spirit should be used but mustbe allowed to dry completely before the test.I 32.14.2 Tuberculin 100,000 units/ml should be withdrawn from the ampoule by needle and syringe and after detaching the needle a smallquantity of solution should be dropped directly from the syringe ontothe skin at the standard test site. Sufficient tuberculin should be used todisperse over an area of skin just greater than the diameter of theperforated head of the unit. (Note that the head of the disposable headis wider than the standard gun). The head of the apparatus should beused to disperse the tuberculin. I 32.14.3 If using the disposable head apparatus, check that the correct head is being used. Apply the apparatus firmly and evenly to the tuberculin covered skin and press on the handle until a click occurs,indicating that the needles have been fired. Do not press further afterthis, but remove the apparatus from the skin, remove the disposablehead from the handle by holding the outer rim and discard the head intoa 'sharps' bin. If using the single use device , press firmly on the top (purple) firing arm. After firing, an audible click is heard as the needlesretract. If using the conventional gun , check that the gun is at the correct needle setting. The end plate should then be applied firmly and evenlyto the area of skin covered by the tuberculin and pressure applied to thehandle until the clicking firing mechanism operates. Do not applyfurther pressure after this, and withdraw the apparatus. I 32.14.4 Wipe off any excess tuberculin from the skin and observe the presence of six puncture marks. If these are not present the test has not been adequately applied. Advise the subject that the arm may becomewetted and washed normally but perfumes and other cosmetics shouldnot be applied. Instructions should be given to the subject to return tohave the test read. Ideally this should be at seven days but the test canbe read between three and 10 days. I 32.15 The Mantoux test I 32.15.1 The PPD preparation for routine use in the Mantoux test contains 100 units/ml and is supplied in 1.0ml ampoules. The contentsof an ampoule will therefore be sufficient for five or six tests. For testsin patients in whom tuberculosis is suspected, or who are known to behypersensitive to tuberculin, the preparation containing 10 units/mlshould test is performed using a 1ml syringe and a short bevel 25 gauge (0.5 x 10mm) or 26 gauge (0.45 x 10mm) needle.A separate syringe and needle must be used for each subject to preventcross-infection. I 32.15.3 As for the Heaf test, the test is normally performed on the flexor surface of the left forearm at the junction of the upper third withthe lower two thirds. The site is cleaned if visibly dirty with spirit andallowed to dry. 0.1ml of the appropriate tuberculin PPD dilution is injected intradermally so that a bleb (peau d'orange) is produced typically of 7mm diameter. The results should be read 48 to72 hours later, but a valid reading can usually be obtained up to 96hours. A positive result consists of induration with a transversediameter of at least 5mm following injection of 0.1ml PPD 100 units/ml.The area of flare is irrelevant. I 32.16 Interpretation of the Heaf and Mantoux tests I 32.16.1 There is some variability in the time at which a test develops its maximum response. For a given test the majority of subjects will bepositive at a given time. A few however may have their maximumresponse just before or after the standard time. I 32.16.2 The Heaf reaction is graded 0-4 according to the degree of induration produced (erythema alone should be ignored). The resultsshould be recorded as a number and not merely as positive or negative. Grade 0 - no induration at the puncture sites. Grade 1 - discrete induration at 4 or more needle sites.Grade 2 - induration around each needle site merging with the next, forming a ring of induration but with a clear centre. Grade 3 - the centre of the reaction becomes filled with induration to form one uniform disc of induration 5-10mm wide. Grade 4 - solid induration over 10mm wide. Vesiculation or ulceration may also occur. Please refer to inside back cover for examples of Heaf test responses.I 32.16.3 Heaf grades 0 and 1 or a Mantoux response of 0-4mm induration are regarded as negative. Individuals who have not previouslyreceived BCG immunisation may be offered immunisation in the absenceof contraindications. However, those who give a history of previousBCG should only be re-immunised if there is no evidence of a character-istic scar and they are tuberculin negative (see 32.3.4). I 32.16.4 Those with a grade 2 reaction (or a Mantoux response of induration of diameter 5-14mm following injection of 0.1ml PPD 100units/ml) are positive. They are hypersensitive to tuberculin protein andshould not be given BCG vaccine. When the immunisation is performedas part of a routine health promotion programme such as the schoolsprogramme, no further action is required. In other circumstances (egnew immigrants under 16 years, contacts of tuberculosis), subjects with agrade 2 reaction who have not previously had a BCG immunisationshould be referred to a chest clinic. I 32.16.5 Contacts of tuberculosis, children in the schools immunisation programme and new immigrants who show a stronglypositive reaction to tuberculin (grade 3 or 4 or a Mantoux response withinduration of at least 15mm diameter following 0.1ml PPD 100 units/ml)should be referred for further investigation and supervision (which mayinclude prophylactic chemotherapy). I 32.17 Factors affecting the tuberculin test I 32.17.1 The reaction to tuberculin protein may be suppressed by the following: a. infectious mononucleosis b. viral infections in general, including those of the upper respiratory tractc. live viral vaccines. Tuberculin testing should not be carried out within three weeks of receiving a live viral vaccine: immunisation programmes should be arranged so that tuberculin testing is carried out before live viral vaccines are given. d. Hodgkin's diseasee. sarcoidosisf. 32.17.2 Subjects who have a negative test but who may have had an upper respiratory tract or other viral infection at the time of testing or atthe time of reading should be retested 2-3 weeks after clinical recoverybefore being given BCG. If a second tuberculin test is necessary it shouldbe carried out on the other arm: repeat testing at one site may alter thereactivity either by hypo- or more often hypersensitising the skin and achanged response may reflect local changes in sensitivity only. BCG IMMUNISATION I 32.18 Introduction It is recommended that BCG vaccine be administered intradermally using aseparate tuberculin syringe and needle for each subject. Jet injectors should not be used . In neonates, infants and very young children (up to five years of age) only, administration of BCG by the percutaneous route using a multiple puncture technique is an acceptable alternative to the intradermal method. It is not recommended for older children, teenagers and adults . 18-20 needles are required and BCG vaccine prepared specifically for percutaneous use (see32.21.2). I 32.19 BCG vaccine I 32.19.1 Freeze-dried vaccine is supplied to NHS users in England without charge by either Health Authorities or Farillon. Thearrangements for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are described inparagraph 32.25. Users should specify clearly whether they require the preparation for intradermal or percutaneous (multiple puncture)immunisation and the package label should be checked before use. I 32.19.2 The freeze-dried vaccine should be protected from light, stored between 2\u00b0 and 8\u00b0C and never frozen. It has a shelf life of 12-18months and should not be used after the expiry date stated on the label. I 32.19.3 The multidose vial of vaccine should be diluted as instructed on the package insert using aseptic precautions, a syringe and suitablelarge needle. The needle may be left in situ for subsequent withdrawal ofvaccine. Do not shake it to mix. Once made up the vaccine should beused within two hours. Any unused reconstituted vaccine should bediscarded at the end of the session.I 32.20 Standard immunisation technique I 32.20.1 The recommended site for giving the vaccine is at the insertion of the deltoid muscle near the middle of the left upper arm.Sites higher on the arm are more likely to lead to keloid formation, thetip of the shoulder particularly. For cosmetic reasons, a scar on theupper and lateral surface of the thigh may be preferred and this is analternative site. I 32.20.2 The vaccine must be given strictly intradermally with a fresh needle and syringe for each subject. The dose is 0.1ml (0.05ml forinfants under three months). This should be drawn into a tuberculinsyringe and a 3/8\" 25g (0.5 x 10mm) or 26g (0.45 x 10mm) shortbevelled needle attached to give the injection. The needle must beattached firmly with the bevel uppermost. I 32.20.3 The upper arm must be approximately 45\u00b0 to the body. This can be achieved if the hand is placed on the hip with the arm abductedfrom the body. I 32.20.4 If the skin is visibly dirty it should be swabbed with spirit and allowed to dry. The operator stretches the skin between the thumband forefinger of one hand and with the other slowly inserts the needle,with the bevel upwards, for about 2mm into the superficial layers of thedermis almost parallel with the surface. The needle can usually be seenthrough the epidermis. A correctly given intradermal injection results ina tense blanched raised bleb (peau d'orange) and considerable resistanceis felt when the fluid is being injected. A bleb typically of 7mm diameterfollows a 0.1ml injection. If little resistance is felt when injecting and adiffuse swelling occurs as opposed to a tense blanched bleb, the needle istoo deep. The needle should be withdrawn and reinserted intradermallybefore more vaccine is given. I 32.20.5 The subject must always be advised of the normal reaction to the injection.32 Tuberculosis: for BCG immunisationI 32.21 Percutaneous BCG immunisation by the multiple puncture technique (for infants and very young children only) I 32.21.1 BCG immunisation as described above by intradermal injection, using a separate needle and syringe for every subject, is theonly recommended method for older children, teenagers and adults.However, this technique can be difficult in infants and very youngchildren. In these latter groups only, percutaneous BCG immunisationby multiple puncture technique is an acceptable alternative. I 32.21.2 Only percutaneous BCG vaccine, which has 50-250 million colony forming units/vial (approximately 10 times the strength ofintradermal BCG), should be used. Users can obtain this from Farillonor their Health Authority or Health Board free of charge (see 32.25).The preparation required should be clearly stated and checked beforeuse. I 32.21.3 The site of injection is over the insertion of the deltoid muscle as previously described. 18-20 needle punctures, with 2mm skinpenetration at a pressure of 5-7lb, are required. The technique is asdescribed for Heaf testing (32.14). I 32.22 Immunisation reaction and care of the immunisation site I 32.22.1 Following intradermal administration of BCG, normally a local reaction develops at the immunisation site within two to six weeks,beginning as a small papule which increases in size for a few weekswidening into a circular area up to 7mm in diameter with scaling,crusting and occasional bruising. Occasionally a shallow ulcer up to10mm in diameter develops. It is not necessary to protect the site frombecoming wet during washing and bathing, but should any oozing occur,a temporary dry dressing may be used until a scab forms. It is essentialthat air is not excluded. If absolutely essential an impervious dressingmay be applied but only for a short period (for example, to permitswimming) as it may delay healing and cause a larger scar. The lesionslowly subsides over several months and eventually heals of BCG in neonates, a small amount of erythema occurs. However this and the 18 pointmarks fade quickly so that by 8 weeks (a little longer in pigmentedskins) there is little to see. A visible long term scar is unlikely. I 32.22.3 After immunisation with BCG vaccine there is a high tuberculin conversion rate and routine further observation of those atnormal risk is not necessary, nor is further tuberculin testing recom-mended. However, in large immunisation programmes, some checkshould be made of the severity of the reactions six weeks or so later,possibly on a sample basis, as part of monitoring the programme. I 32.22.4 In health-care staff and others at occupational risk, the site of immunisation should be inspected six weeks later to confirm that a satis-factory reaction has occurred. Reactions should be recorded by measuringthe transverse diameter in mm. Only those who show no reaction to BCGrequire a post-BCG tuberculin test, after which anyone at occupationalrisk who is still tuberculin negative should be re-immunised. If afterreimmunisation there is still no evidence of a satisfactory reaction or ofconversion to a positive tuberculin test, the individual should be told theresult and consideration given to moving to work not involving exposureto patients with tuberculosis or with tuberculous material. I 32.23 Adverse reactions to BCG I 32.23.1 Vertigo and dizziness have occasionally been reported following BCG immunisation, and, rarely, immediate allergic type oranaphylactic reactions. I 32.23.2 Severe injection site reactions, large ulcers and abscesses are most commonly caused by faulty injection technique where part or all ofthe dose is administered too deeply (subcutaneously instead ofintradermally). The immunisation of individuals who are tuberculinpositive may also give rise to such reactions. To avoid these, doctors andnurses who carry out tuberculin skin tests and administer BCG vaccinemust be trained in the interpretation of the results of tuberculin tests aswell as in the technique of intradermal injection with syringe and needle. I 32.23.3 Keloid formation at the injection site is an uncommon and largely avoidable, complication of BCG immunisation. Some sites aremore prone to keloid formation than others and those immunisingshould adhere to the two sites recommended in this chapter (the mid-upper arm or the thigh). Most experience has been gained in the use of the upper arm and it is known that the risk of keloid formation isincreased manyfold when the injection is given at a site higher than theinsertion of the deltoid muscle near the middle of the upper arm (see32.20.1 and figure on page 235). I 32.23.4 Apart from these injection site reactions, other complications following BCG immunisation are rare and mostly consist of adenitiswith or without suppuration and discharge. A minor degree of adenitismay occur in the weeks following immunisation and should not beregarded as a complication. Very rarely a lupoid type of local lesion hasbeen reported. A few cases of widespread dissemination of the injectedorganisms have been reported. I 32.23.5 It is important that all complications are recorded and reported to a chest physician. Serious or unusual complications(including abscess and keloid scarring) should be reported to the Commit-tee on Safety of Medicines using the yellow card system, and techniquesreviewed. Every effort should be made to recover and identify the causa-tive organism from any lesion constituting a serious complication. I 32.24 Record keeping and monitoring I 32.24.1 It is important that records are maintained to show the result of tuberculin skin testing, whether the subject had previously receivedBCG, and whether or not BCG was subsequently given. These recordsshould show who administered the skin test or vaccine, the batchnumber of the vaccine, and who recorded the result or lesion. Particularattention should be paid to unusual or severe reactions. Such recordsshould be kept for at least 10 years. I 32.24.2 The results of tuberculin skin tests and of BCG immunisation of hospital staff (including students) should be recorded on appropriaterecords. If staff or students move to another hospital or training school,the record cards should be transferred to the occupational health unit.Individual record cards may be carried by members of staff. I 32.24.3 For monitoring selective neonatal and schools BCG programmes, records will need to be kept of numbers in the targetgroups, the number skin tested and the number found to be negative (forthe schools programme), vaccine and PPD I 32.25.1 BCG vaccines and PPD: are manufactured by Evans Medical Tel 0345 451500 (local rate) or 01372 364000. I 32.25.2 of freeze-dried BCG vaccine (intradermal and percutaneous) and tuberculin PPD are distributed at nocharge to the user by Farillon (tel 01708 379000) either to HealthAuthorities or direct to users. I 32.25.3 In Scotland, the Health Boards order BCG vaccine and Tuberculin PPD direct from AAH or Unichem Ltd as and when required. I 32.25.4 In Wales, orders for both BCG vaccine and PPD should be sent monthly by health authorities to Farillon (tel 01708 379000). I 32.25.5 In Northern Ireland, BCG vaccine and PPD are provided through the Hospital Pharmaceutical Service. Enquiries about suppliesshould be directed to the Regional Pharmacist Procurement Co-ordinator, Eastern Health and Social Services Board, 12-21 LinenhallStreet, Belfast (Tel. 01232 321313). I 32.26 Supplies of devices for Heaf testing and percutaneous administration of BCG I 32.26.1 The disposable head Bignell 2000 multiple puncture apparatus for tuberculin skin testing by the Heaf method (re-usablehandle and disposable heads) is available from: Bignell Surgical Instru-ments 18 needle disposable head isavailable for use with this apparatus for BCG immunisation using thepercutaneous (multiple puncture) technique.

Most of the nearly 2000 serotypes in the genus Salmonella cause only local infection of the gastro-intestinal tract (gastro-enteritis or 'food poisoning'). S. typhi, S. paratyphi A, B and C and occasionally other salmonella species may invade systemically toproduce a serious illness with prolonged pyrexia and prostration. Theincubation period varies from one to three weeks depending on theinfecting dose. All patients with typhoid and paratyphoid excrete theorganisms at some stage during their illness. About 10% of patientswith typhoid fever excrete the organism for three months following theacute illness and 2-5% become permanent carriers. The likelihood ofbecoming a chronic carrier increases with age, especially in females. I 33.1.2 Typhoid fever is spread by the faecal-oral route, usually through food or drink that has been contaminated with the excreta of ahuman case or carrier. It is therefore predominantly a disease ofcountries with poor sanitation and poor standards of personal and foodhygiene. Outbreaks of infection have been caused by corned beef(Aberdeen 1964), water supplies (Zermatt 1963) and shellfishcontaminated by infected water or sewage. Around 200 cases of typhoidfever are notified in England and Wales each year; over 80% of thesehave been acquired abroad, principally in the Indian Sub-continent. I 33.2 Vaccine I 33.2.1 Three typhoid vaccines are available. I 33.2.2 Monovalent whole cell typhoid vaccine contains not less than 1000 million heat-killed, phenol-preserved S. typhi organisms per ml. One 0.5ml injection confers around 70-80% protection which fadesafter one year. Two doses, four to six weeks apart, give protection forthree years or more. I 33.2.3 Typhoid Vi polysaccharide antigen vaccine is a parenteral vaccine containing Vi antigen from the capsule of the organism,preserved with phenol. Each 0.5ml dose contains 25mcg of antigen. Asingle dose gives 70-80% protection for at least three years.33 TyphoidTyphoid 244 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseI 33.2.4 Oral typhoid contains a live attenuated Salmonella typhi strain (Ty 21a) in an enteric-coated capsule. One capsule taken on alternate days for three doses appears to produce similar efficacy toparenteral vaccines, although the length of protection may be less: inthose not repeatedly or constantly exposed to S. typhi it is recommended the full course is repeated after one year. The vaccine is unstable atnormal room temperatures. I 33.2.5 The efficacy of typhoid vaccines is partly related to the size of any infecting dose encountered after immunisation. The vaccines are not100% effective and the importance in preventing infection of scrupulousattention to personal, food and water hygiene must still be emphasisedfor those travelling to endemic areas. I 33.2.6 Typhoid vaccines for injection should be stored at 2-8\u00b0C and not frozen. Any partly used multidose containers should be discarded atthe end of the immunisation session. I 33.2.7 Oral typhoid vaccine is not stable at normal room temperature. It is essential to replace unused vaccine in the refrigeratorbetween doses. The package should be kept dry and out of the light. I 33.3 Recommendations I 33.3.1 Typhoid immunisation is advised for: (a) Laboratory workers handling specimens which may contain typhoid organisms (see 12.20). (b) Travellers to countries in Africa, Asia, Central and South America and the Caribbean where sanitation and hygiene may be poor and forsome countries in Eastern Europe, although immunisation againsttyphoid may be less important for short stays in good accommodation(see Health Information for Overseas Travel for more details). I 33.3.2 Typhoid immunisation is notrecommended for contacts of a carrier or for controlling common-source outbreaks.Typhoid33 Typhoid Immunisation against Infectious Disease 245I 33.4 Route of administration and dosage Adults I 33.4.1 Whole cell vaccine: a primary course of two doses four to six weeks apart. A reinforcing dose every three years for those at continuedor repeated risk. (A single primary injection will give short-termimmunity; a reinforcing dose will then be needed after one year). I 33.4.2 The first dose of the primary course must be given by intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injection for a reliable antigenicresponse. Subsequent doses may be given by intradermal injection, whichmay reduce the severity of adverse reactions. I 33.4.3 Vi polysaccharide vaccine: a single dose by intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injection. Re-immunisation with a single dose everythree years for those who remain at risk of infection. I 33.4.4 Oral Ty 21a vaccine: one capsule on alternate days for three doses. It should be taken on an empty stomach with a cool drink. Thosetaking the vaccine home must be instructed to keep it in the refrigeratorbetween doses. Children I 33.4.5 Immunisation against typhoid is not recommended for children under one year of age: the risk of infection is low and none ofthe vaccines is suitable for use in this age group. Children under 18months may show a suboptimal response to polysaccharide antigenvaccines; use of this vaccine in this age group should be governed by thelikely risk of exposure to infection. I 33.4.6 Oral typhoid vaccine is not suitable for children under six years of age. I 33.4.7 Parenteral typhoid vaccines do not contain live organisms and maytherefore be given to HIV positive individuals in the absence of contraindications. The oral vaccine contains live organisms and iscontraindicated.I 33.4.8 Dose I 33.5 Adverse reactions I 33.5.1 Whole cell typhoid vaccine commonly produces local reactions such as redness, swelling, pain and tenderness which maypersist for a few days. Systemic reactions include malaise, nausea,headache and pyrexia. They usually resolve within 36 hours.Neurological complications have been described but are rare. Reactionsare especially common after repeated injections and are often moremarked in people over 35 years. They may be reduced by giving thesecond and subsequent injections intradermally. 33 TyphoidTyphoid 246 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseVaccine Primary Course Boosters Whole cell vaccine 0.5ml im or deep sc 0.5ml im or sc or 0.1ml Adults then 0.5ml im or deep id every three years sc or 0.1ml id 4-6 weeks later Children 0.25ml im or deep sc 0.25ml im or deep sc aged 1-10 years then 0.25ml im or deep or 0.1ml id every sc or 0.1ml id 3 years4-6 weeks later under one year not recommendedVi polysaccharide antigen vaccineAdults and children 0.5ml im or deep sc 0.5ml im or deep> 18 months sc every 3 years Children < 18 months see 33.4.5Oral Ty 21a vaccine Adults and children 1 capsule on alternate For residents of non-> 6 years days x 3 doses -endemic areas 3 dose course annually under 6 years not recommended Typhoid33 Typhoid Immunisation against Infectious Disease 247I 33.5.2 Local reactions to Vi polysaccharide vaccine are mild and transient and systemic reactions less common than with whole cellvaccine. I 33.5.3 Oral Ty 21a vaccine may cause transient mild nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhoea and urticarial rash. I 33.5.4 All severe reactions should be reported to the Committee on Safety of Medicines using the yellow card system. I 33.6 Contraindications I 33.6.1 The following contraindications should be observed: a) Acute febrile illness.b) Severe reaction to a previous dose of the same type of vaccine.c) Pregnancy: as with other vaccines, typhoid vaccine should only be given if a clear indication exists. d) Oral Ty 21a vaccine should not be given to those taking an antimicrobial agent, and if mefloquine is being taken for malariachemoprophylaxis the vaccine should be taken at least 12 hours beforeor after the mefloquine. e) Oral Ty 21a vaccine should not be taken during persistent diarrhoea or vomiting. f) Oral typhoid vaccine is contraindicated in those with immunosuppression due to disease or treatment. I 33.6.2 Oral typhoid vaccine and oral polio vaccine should be given at least three weeks apart on the theoretical grounds of possibleinterference of the immune response in the gut. I 33.6.3 Typhoid vaccine is not recommended during an outbreak of typhoid fever in the UK. It affords no immediate protection, it maytemporarily increase susceptibility to infection and, by stimulatingantibody production, it makes interpretation of diagnostic serologicaltests more difficult.I 33.7 Management of outbreaks I 33.7.1 The Consultant in Communicable Disease Control (CCDC) or in Scotland, the Chief Administrative Medical Officer (CAMO)should be informed immediately whenever a patient is suspected ofhaving typhoid fever without waiting for laboratory confirmation. Earlyidentification of the source of infection is vital in containing this disease. I 33.7.2 Household or other close contacts of cases should be excluded from work if they are involved in food handling, until at leasttwo, and in some cases three, negative faecal cultures have beenobtained. The need for strict personal hygiene should be stressed. I 33.8 Supplies I 33.8.1 Whole cell typhoid vaccine is available in 1.5 ml vials from Evans Medical Ltd, Tel. 0345 451500 (local rate) or 01372 364000 (thisvaccine is not available at the time of going to press.)

In the home the secondary infection rate from acase of chickenpox can be as high as 90%. It is most common inchildren below the age of ten in whom it is usually mild. Sincechickenpox is so common in childhood, 90% of adults are immune. I 34.1.2 The incidence of varicella is seasonal and reaches a peak from March to May. The incubation period is between two and three weeks. I 34.1.3 Vesicles appear without prodromal illness on the face and scalp, spreading to the trunk and abdomen and eventually to the limbs;after three or four days they dry with a granular scab and are usuallyfollowed by further crops. Vesicles may be so few as to be missed or sonumerous that they become confluent, covering most of the body. Virusis plentiful in the naso-pharynx in the first few days and in the vesiclesbefore they dry up; the infectious period is therefore from one to twodays before the rash appears until the vesicles are dry. This may beprolonged in immunosuppressed patients. I 34.1.4 The disease can be more serious in adults, particularly pregnant women and those who smoke, as they are at risk of fulminatingvaricella pneumonia. For neonates and immunosuppressed individuals,the risk is greatly for disseminated or haemorrhagic varicella. I 34.1.5 Herpes zoster is caused by of the patient's varicella virus. It is transmissible to susceptible individuals aschickenpox but there is very little evidence that it can be acquired fromanother individual with chickenpox. Although more common in theelderly, it can occur in children and especially in immunosuppressedindividuals. Vesicles appear in the dermatome representing cranial orspinal ganglia where the virus has been dormant. The affected area maybe intensely painful with associated paraesthesiae.34 VaricellaVaricella 252 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseI 34.1.6 Risks to the fetus and neonate from maternal chickenpox are related to the time of infection in the mother: a. In the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. Congenital (fetal) varicella syndrome which includes limb hypoplasia, microcephaly, cataracts, growthretardation and skin scarring. The mortality rate is high. From the largestavailable prospective study, the incidence has been estimated to be less than1% in the first 12 weeks and around 2% between 13 and 20 weeks ofpregnancy. b. In the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. Herpes zoster in an otherwise healthy infant. c. A week before, to a week after delivery. Severe and even fatal disease in the neonate. Before the introduction of VZIG in the UK, half thedeaths in infants under one year occurred in those aged less than 3 weeksin whom infection would have been contracted before, during birth orduring the first week of life. I 34.2 Varicella vaccine Live attenuated varicella vaccine has recently been licensed in some countries, but currently no vaccine is licensed for use in the UK. It is available on anamed patient basis from SmithKline Beecham and Pasteur Merieux MSD Ltdfor immunocompromised individuals, particularly children with I 34.3 Human Varicella-Zoster Immunoglobulin (VZIG) I 34.3.1 Two licensed VZIG preparations are available in the UK. VZIG distributed in England and Wales is made by the Bio ProductsLaboratory (BPL), Elstree; and in Scotland and Northern Ireland it isprovided by the Protein Fractionation Centre (PFC), Edinburgh. VZIG isprepared from pooled plasma of UK blood donors with a history ofrecent chickenpox or herpes zoster, or from those who on screening arefound to have suitably high titres of V-Z antibody. The supply of VZIGis limited by the availability of suitable donors and its use is thereforerestricted to those at greatest risk and for whom there is evidence that itis likely to be effective.Varicella34 Varicella Immunisation against Infectious Disease 253I 34.3.2 VZIG is a clear, pale yellow fluid or light brown solution dispensed in vials containing 250 mg protein in a nominal 1.7ml of fluid(minimum potency 100 iu of VZ antibody per ml) with added thiomersaland sodium chloride. On keeping, a slight turbidity or occasionalparticles may appear. I 34.3.3 VZIG should be stored in a refrigerator between 2-8\u00b0C. Under these conditions it has a nominal shelf life of three years. It canbe stored for short periods at room temperature and is sufficiently heatstable to be despatched by post. VZIG must NOT be frozen. I 34.3.4 All immunoglobulins are prepared from HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C negative donors. I 34.4 Recommendations VZIG prophylaxis is recommended for individuals who fulfil all of the following three criteria: (a) a clinical condition which increases the risk of severe varicella; this includes immunosuppressed patients (see 34.5), neonates (see 34.6) pregnantwomen (see (b) no antibodies to varicella-zoster (VZ) virus (see 34.8).(c) significant exposure to chickenpox or herpes zoster (see 34.9).Antiviral chemotherapy may be used for patients with other clinical conditions in whom attenuation of an attack of chickenpox would be desirable.I 34.5 Immunosuppressed patients These are defined in Chapter 7 and include the following: (a) patients currently being treated with chemotherapy or generalised radiotherapy, or within 6 months of terminating such treatment; (b) patients who have received an organ transplant and are currently on immunosuppressive treatment; (c) patients who within the previous 6 months have received a bone marrow transplant; (d) children who within the previous 3 months have received prednisolone, orally or rectally, at a daily dose (or its equivalent) of 2 mg/kg/day for at leastone week, or 1 mg/kg/day for one month. For adults, an equivalent dose isharder to define but immunosuppression should be considered in those whohave received a dose of around 40 mg prednisolone per day for more than oneweek in the previous 3 months; (e) patients on lower doses of steroids, given in combination with cytotoxic drugs (including anti-thymic globulin or other immunosuppressants); (f) patients with evidence of impaired cell mediated immunity, for example severe combined immune deficiency syndromes, Di George syndrome andother combined immunodeficiency syndromes; (g) patients with symptomatic HIV infection. VZIG is not indicated for asymptomatic HIV positive patients with normal CD4 counts as there is noevidence of increased risk of severe varicella in these individuals; (h) patients with gammaglobulin deficiencies who are receiving replacement therapy with intravenous normal immunoglobulin, do not require VZIG (see7.3.7). I Note: For immunosuppressed patients with bleeding disorders in whom intramuscular injections are contraindicated, see 34.10. 34 VaricellaVaricella 254 Infectious Immunisation against Infectious occur despite VZIG prophylaxis; varicella immunisation should therefore be considered for susceptibleimmunosuppressed patients at long term risk (see 34.2). About half ofsusceptible immunosuppressed home contacts will develop clinical chickenpoxdespite VZIG prophylaxis and a further 15% will be infected subclinically.There is no difference in outcome whether VZIG is given within 3 days or 4-7days after exposure. I 34.6 Neonates VZIG is recommended for the following: (a) Infants whose mothers develop chickenpox (but not herpes zoster) in the period 7 days before to 28 days after delivery. (b) VZ antibody negative infants exposed to chickenpox or herpes zoster in the first 28 days of life. If supplies of VZIG are short, issues toinfants with post-natal exposure may be restricted to those in contactduring the first 7 days of life. The following infants do not require VZIG since maternal antibody will be present: Infants born more than seven days after the onset of maternal chickenpox. Infants whose mothers have a positive history of chickenpox and/or a positive VZ antibody result. Infants whose mothers develop zoster before or after delivery. I Note: About half of neonates exposed to maternal varicella will become infected despite VZIG prophylaxis. In up to two thirds of these infants infection is mildor asymptomatic, but rare fatal cases have been reported despite VZIGprophylaxis in those with onset of maternal chickenpox in the period 4 daysbefore to 2 days after delivery. Early treatment with intravenous acyclovir isrecommended for infants in this exposure category who develop varicelladespite VZIG prophylaxis.I 34.7 Pregnant women VZIG is recommended for VZ antibody negative pregnant contacts exposed at any stage of pregnancy. However, when supplies of VZIG are short, issues topregnant women may be restricted to those exposed during the first 20 weeksof pregnancy or near term (within 21 days of the estimated date of delivery). I Note: VZIG does not prevent infection even when given within 72 hours of exposure. However it may attenuate disease if given up to ten days after exposure. Severematernal varicella may still occur despite VZIG prophylaxis. There is someevidence that the likelihood of fetal infection during the first 20 weeks ofgestation is reduced in women who develop chickenpox under cover of VZIG. I 34.8 Determination of VZ immune status I 34.8.1 The majority of adults and a substantial proportion of children without a definite history of chickenpox will be VZ antibodypositive. One UK study found that 11% of children aged 1 to 5 years,37% aged 6 to 16 years and 89% of adults given VZIG on the basis of anegative history of chickenpox were VZ antibody positive. To preventwastage of VZIG, all individuals being considered for VZIG should havea serum sample tested for VZ antibody; only those without antibody require VZIG. In an emergency, antibody can be estimated within 24 hours; VZIG can be ordered (see 34.12) and should be returned if thetest is positive. Advice on testing for VZ antibody should be obtainedfrom the local Public Health or Hospital Laboratory. I 34.8.2 VZ antibody detected in patients who have been transfused or who have received intravenous immunoglobulin in the previous 3months may have been passively acquired. Although VZIG is notindicated if antibody from other blood products is detectable, re-testingin the event of a subsequent exposure will be required as the patient mayhave become antibody negative. I 34.8.3 About 15% of patients given VZIG who remain symptom free after a home contact will have had a subclinical infection. Patientswho have received VZIG in the past, following a close exposure, shouldtherefore be re-tested in the event of another exposure, to identify thosewho have seroconverted asymptomatically and are Varicella Immunisation against Infectious Disease 257I 34.8.4 The value of a clinical history of chickenpox in determining immune status varies with patient group: (a) Immunosuppressed contacts: Whenever possible, contacts with a positive history of chickenpox should be tested to confirm the presenceof VZ antibody. Those with a positive history in whom VZ antibody isnot detected by a sensitive assay should be given VZIG. VZIG is not indicated in immunosuppressed contacts with detectable antibody as the amount of antibody provided by VZIG will notsignificantly increase VZ antibody titres in those who are alreadypositive. Second attacks of chickenpox can occasionally occur inimmunosuppressed VZ antibody positive patients, but these appear berelated to defects in cell-mediated immunity. While it is recommended that immunosuppressed patients without a history of chickenpox should be tested for VZ antibody, VZIGadministration should not be delayed past 7 days after initial contactwhile an antibody test is done. Under these circumstances VZIG shouldbe given on the basis of a negative history of chickenpox. (b) Neonates: Infants whose mothers develop chickenpox less than 8 days before delivery, or after birth, can be presumed to be VZ antibodynegative. The VZ antibody status of infants whose mothers have anegative history should determined by testing a maternal blood samplebefore VZIG is given. A small proportion of premature infants who are born before 28 weeks of gestation or with a birth weight less than 1000 gms may not possessmaternal antibody despite a positive history in the mother. (c) Pregnant women: Those with a positive history of chickenpox do not require VZIG. Those with a negative history must be tested for VZantibody before VZIG is given. The outcome in pregnant women is notadversely affected if administration of VZIG is delayed up to 10 daysafter initial contact while a VZ antibody test is done.I 34.9 Definition of a significant exposure to varicella- zoster virus Three aspects of the exposure are relevant: (a) Type of varicella-zoster infection in index case: The risk of acquiring infection from an immunocompetant individual with non-exposed zoster lesions (e.g. thoraco-lumbar) is remote. The issue ofVZIG should therefore be restricted to those in contact withchickenpox, or the following: disseminated zoster, immunocompetentindividuals with ophthalmic zoster) patients with localised zoster on any part of thebody (in whom viral shedding may be greater). (b) The timing of the exposure in relation to onset of rash in index case: VZIG should normally be restricted to patients exposed to a case of chickenpox or disseminated zoster between 48 hours beforeonset of rash until cropping has ceased and crusting of all lesions, orday of onset of rash until crusting for those exposed to localisedzoster. (c) Closeness and duration of contact: The following should be used as a guide to the type of exposure, other than maternal/neonatal andcontinuous home contact, that requires VZIG prophylaxis: Contact in the same room (e.g. in a house or classroom or a 2-4 bed hospital bay) for a significant period of time (15 minutes or more). Face-to-face contact, for example while having a conversation. In the case of large open wards, where air-borne transmission at a distance has occasionally been reported, the necessity of giving VZIGto all susceptible high risk contacts should be considered, particularlyin paediatric wards where the degree of contact may be difficult todefine.34 VaricellaVaricella 258 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseVaricellaI 34.10 Dose of VZIG for prophylaxis The dosage for both the BPL and PFC products are as follows: 0 - 5 years 250 mg (1 vial) 6 - 10 years 500 mg (2 vials) 11 - 14 years 750 mg (3 vials)15 years and over 1000 mg (4 vials) VZIG is given by intramuscular injection as soon as possible and not later than ten days after exposure. It must not be given intravenously. If a second exposure occurs after three weeks, a further dose is required.Contacts with bleeding disorders who cannot be given an intramuscular injection should be given intravenous normal immunoglobulin at a dose of0.2g per kg body weight (ie. 4 mls/kg for a 5% solution) instead. This willproduce serum VZ antibody levels equivalent to those achieved with VZIG. I 34.11 Treatment There is no evidence that VZIG is effective in the treatment of severe disease. Since antibody production can be delayed in immunosuppressed individuals,intravenous commercial preparations of normal human immunoglobulin maybe used to provide an immediate source of antibody. I 34.12 Supplies England and Wales: Available from Public Health Laboratories and the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) (Tel. 0181 200 6868). Northern Ireland: Available from the Public Health Laboratory, Belfast City Hospital, Lisburn Road, Belfast Tel. 01232 329241. Scotland: Available from Regional Transfusion CentresVZIG is issued free of charge to patients who meet the criteria given in 34.4. No other licensed VZIG preparations apart from the BPL and PFC productsare available the DiseaseI 34.13 Safety I 34.13.1 VZIG is well tolerated. Very rarely anaphylactoid reactions occur in individuals with hypogammaglobulinaemia who have IgA anti-bodies, or those who have had an atypical reaction to blood transfusion I 34.13.2 Severe reactions should be reported to the Committee on Safety of Medicines using the yellow card system. I 34.13.3 No cases of blood borne infection acquired through immunoglobulin preparations designed for intramuscular use have beendocumented in any country. I 34.14 Management of hospital outbreaks I 34.17.1 Susceptible staff with a significant exposure to VZ virus (see 34.9) including those dressing localised zoster lesions on non-exposedareas of the body, should whenever possible be excluded from contactwith high risk patients from eight to 21 days after exposure. I 34.17.2 To simplify procedures after the admission or recognition of a case, it is recommended that hospital staff without a definite history ofchickenpox should be routinely screened for V-Z antibody so that thosesusceptible are already identified. This is particularly important for staffin contact with high risk groups such as pregnant women andimmunosuppressed patients.

Enders G, Miller E, Cradock-Watson JE, Bolley The consequences of herpes against Infectious Disease FeverI35.1 Introduction I35.1.1 Yellow fever is an acute flavivirus infection spread by the bite of an infected mosquito and occurring in tropical Africa and SouthAmerica (it has never been seen in Asia). It ranges in severity fromnon-specific symptoms to an illness of sudden onset with fever, vomitingand prostration which may progress to haemorrhage and jaundice. Inindigenous populations in endemic areas fatality is about 5%; innon-indigenous individuals and during epidemics, the case fatality ratefor unimmunised adults can exceed 50%. The incubation period isgenerally 3-6 days but may be longer. Death usually occurs 7-10 daysafter the onset of illness. There is no specific treatment for yellow fever. I35.1.2 Two epidemiological forms of yellow fever are recognised although they are clinically and aetiologically identical. In urban yellow fever, the host is man and the disease is spread by the mosquito Aedes aegypti which lives and breeds in close association with man. Jungle yellow fever is transmitted among non-human hosts (mainly monkeys)by forest mosquitoes which may also bite and infect humans. These may,if subsequently bitten by Aedes aegypti , become the source of outbreaks of the urban form of the disease. The virus can reappear after longintervals, and outbreaks and severe epidemics continue to occur fromtime to time in Africa. Rural populations are at greatest risk. I35.1.3 Preventative measures against urban yellow fever include eradication of Aedes mosquitoes, protection from mosquito bites, and immunisation. Jungle yellow fever can only be prevented byimmunisation. I35.1.4 There is no risk of transmission in the UK from imported cases since the mosquito vector does not occur in the UK. I35.1.5 Immunisation against yellow fever, documented by a valid International Certification of Vaccination, is compulsory for entry intosome countries either for all travellers or for those arriving from infectedareas. Requirements are published annually by the World HealthOrganisation in the publication 'International Travel and Health' andare included in 'Health Information for Overseas Travel', but should alsobe checked at the relevant Embassy before travel.35 Yellow Fever Immunisation against Infectious Disease 263NOTIFIABLE35 Yellow Fever 264 Immunisation against Infectious DiseaseI35.2 Vaccine I35.2.1 Yellow fever vaccine is a live attenuated freeze-dried preparation of the 17D strain of yellow fever virus grown in leucosis-freechick embryos. Each 0.5ml dose contains not less than 1000 mouseLD50 units. The vaccine contains no more than 2 iu of neomycin and 5iu of polymyxin per dose. I35.2.2 The vaccine should be stored at 2-8\u00b0C and protected from light. The diluent supplied for use with the vaccine should be storedbelow 25\u00b0C but not frozen. After reconstitution, the vaccine should bekept cool, protected from light and used within one hour. Any unusedvaccine should be destroyed at the end of the immunisation session byincineration at a temperature of not less than 1100\u00b0C by a registeredwaste disposal contractor, or by disinfection. I35.2.3 A single dose correctly given confers immunity in nearly 100% of recipients; immunity persists for at least ten years and probablyfor life, although re-immunisation is currently recommended after tenyears. I35.2.4 Yellow fever vaccine is given only at designated centres (these are listed in the UK Health Departments' book 'Health Information forOverseas Travel') and costs are passed on to the vaccinee. I 35.3 Recommendations I35.3.1 The following should be immunised: a. Laboratory workers handling infected material.b. Persons aged nine months and over travelling through or living in infected areas and those travelling outside urban areas ofcountries in the yellow fever endemic zone (see maps in 'HealthInformation for Overseas Travel'), even if these countries have notofficially reported the disease and do not require evidence ofimmunisation on entry. Immunisation under nine months is notrecommended but may be performed if exposure to the risk ofinfection cannot be avoided. c. Travellers requiring an International Certificate of Vaccination for entry into a country.Yellow FeverFurther details about the recommendations for travellers are contained in the UK Health Departments' book 'Health Information for OverseasTravel'. I35.3.2 The dose is 0.5ml by deep subcutaneous injection irrespective of age but see 35.5.2. I35.3.3 Re-immunisation every ten years is recommended for those at risk. I35.3.4 The International Certificate is valid for ten years from the tenth day after primary immunisation and immediately after re-immunisation. I 35.4 Adverse reactions I35.4.1 5-10% of recipients have mild headache, myalgia, low-grade fever or soreness at the injection site 5-10 days after immunisation.Immediate allergic type reactions such as urticaria and, rarely,anaphylaxis have also been reported. I35.4.2 Rarely, encephalitis has been described following the 17D tissue culture vaccine in young infants, all but one of whom haverecovered without sequelae. I35.4.3 Severe reactions should be reported to the Committee on Safety of Medicines using the yellow card system. I 35.5 Contraindications I35.5.1 The usual contraindications to a live virus vaccine should be observed (see 7.3). Yellow fever vaccine should not be given to: a. Persons suffering from febrile illness.b. Patients receiving high-dose corticosteroid or immuno-suppressive treatment, including radiation. c. Patients suffering from malignant conditions such as lymphoma, leukaemia, Hodgkin's disease or other tumours of thereticulo-endothelial system, or where the immunologicalmechanism may be impaired as in hypogammaglobulinaemia.35 Yellow Fever Immunisation against Infectious Disease 265d. Pregnant women, because of the theoretical risk of fetal infection. However if a pregnant woman must travel to a high-riskarea, she should be immunised since the risk from yellow feveroutweighs that of immunisation. e. Persons known to be hypersensitive to neomycin or polymyxin or to have had an anaphylactic reaction to egg. A letter stating thatimmunisation is contraindicated on these grounds may beacceptable in some countries. Advice should be sought from theappropriate Embassy. f.
