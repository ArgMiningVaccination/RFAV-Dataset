From the food we eat to the company we keep to the thoughts that enter and leave our psyche, everything we can conceive of in the physical world is a byproduct of particles vibrating at varying speeds. And, when we learn how to move with and shift vibration, we literally become alchemists in our lives. It's pure science. Each of us has the power to create our reality: physically, mentally and spiritually. This October, join Vanessa for a three-day immersion into the healing power of energy medicine. This program bridges the gap between ancient shamanic teachings and contemporary science, providing a tangible experience of working with the esoteric. From traditional Chinese medicine to Reiki and polarity therapy, this program will dissect the common thread in various healing modalities and teach you to enact them in an applied way. You'll gain detailed knowledge, reliable tools, assessment skills, hands-on experience, and most importantly confidence to harness your innate healing potential. THE PROGRAM: Discover the foundations of energy medicine Learn the science of directing spirit for both physical and emotional healing See, feel, and work with subtle energy Experience how movement, sound, visualization, and intentioned touch can release trauma through somatic experiencing Practice techniques to facilitate energetic integration in others (either for working as a practitioner or simply to support individuals you love) Break through old patterning to harness personal power, experience your ability to self-heal and to hold space for others, and amplify your innate gifts to share with the world.
