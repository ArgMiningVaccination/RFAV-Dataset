Microscopy Molecular CharacterizationSeparation Science Thermal the editor JORG GREUEL/PHOTODISC/GETTY IMAGESPharmTech.com/forum Walking the exhibit floor of an industry trade show, one be- comes accustomed to seeing certain incongruities. Scattered in with bioreactors and filling lines, you can expect to see various circus perform- ers, putting greens, and the occasional motorcycle being raffled off. But at the June 2011 Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) annual convention in Washington, DC, one such incon- gruity was not a gimmick. It was the Samsung booth, smack in the middle of the exhibit floor. The electronics manufacturer has let its interest in the biopharmaceutical market be known for some time now. The company's $389-million invest- ment in biosimilars was reported by Reuters in July 2009, who also quoted Samsung Spokesman James Chung as saying, \"Biosimilars is one the busi- nesses [sic] we aim to grow strategi- cally. We are planning to participate (in the business) aggressively.\" The initiative appears to dovetail with South Korea's plans to become a global leader in biosimilar research and development. Samsung, along with other South-Korean-based electronics firms, is contributing to a government initiative to develop the country's bi- osimilar industry. It may not be as odd as it seems that an electronics company is interested in biosimilars. After all, establishing bioequivalence between innovator and follow-on biologics will require a great deal of analytics, which might make use of electronic sensors and components. The oddity is that Sam- sung intends to actually manufacture biosimilars. Earlier this year, Samsung an- nounced its partnership with Quintiles in a venture valued at $266 million, which, according to a February report by Bloomberg , is expected to start pro- ducing biosimilars by 2013, with most of these sales targeted at markets out- side of the United States. US companies are also getting into the market. Pfizer publicly described its interest in the sector at the BIO con- vention. Diem Nguyen, Pfizer's general manager for the Biosimilars Business Unit, outlined the company's intention to enter the market with some small, well-defined biologicals, including in- sulin, before moving into larger more complex drugs. All of these entrants are spurred by optimistic projections of the market potential for these drugs. IMS Health released a report in July 2011 estimat- ing that the biosimilar market will reach $2.5 billion globally by 2015. Other projections are even more en thusiastic. I thought I heard a McKin- sey consultant project the biosimilar market to be $30 to $50 billion by 2020. Samsung, according to the Bloomberg report, is projecting its revenues from biosimilar products to possibly exceed $1.8 billion by 2020 based on its esti- mated demand for these medicines. Yet, I find myself wondering: Why now? What's so compelling about this growth opportunity as opposed to, say, small-molecule generic drugs, branded monoclonal antibodies, gene therapies, or genomics-based drugs? At one time or another, each of these was deemed to be the next big thing in pharmaceuticals. Given the anticipated difficulty in manufacturing biosimilars and the almost-certain regulatory requirement for some limited clinical data on the follow-on drugs, how much profit is there really to be made in them? And finally, there is the disturbing variability in those market projections themselves. Is it really possible that the market will grow from $2.5 billion to $50 billion in just the five years be- tween 2015 and 2020? Or are analysts using wildly different starting assump- tions? And if they are, can we trust that anyone's model is robust? I know we'll all be watching and reading with interest as the biosimilar story unfolds. And only time will tell whether biosimilars are the next big growth area, or just the latest high-tech bubble.

Recent animal studies indicate that the transdermal route could be a viable option.Researchers from the Georgia In- stitute of Technology vaccinated mice against influenza using patches that contained dissolving microneedles. This administration method provided at least as much protection as tradi- tional hypodermic injections, accord- ing to their July 2010 article in Nature Medicine . A $10-million grant from the Na- tional Institutes of Health will enable the researchers, in cooperation with Emory University, to develop the patch further and conduct a Phase I clinical trial. The patch uses a dry form of the vaccine, and the team will study its sta- bility to determine whether it can be stored without refrigeration. Another goal of the study is to en- sure that the patch is simple and re- liable enough for any patient to use without assistance, says Mark Praus- nitz, the project's principal investiga- tor. If the study is successful, the patch eventually could become a more popu- lar delivery device than autoinjectors. Until recently, transdermal deliv- ery had been restricted to small and lipophilic molecules. Projects such as Prausnitz's open the possibility that vaccines and other large-mole- cule drugs could be given effectively through the skin. Such easy and pain- less administration could have big benefits for public health. For needle- phobes and drug-delivery scientists alike, the prospects are exciting. PTNew studies reveal the promise and feasibility of transdermal vaccine delivery.

They ended up being used to bottle homegrown and dried herbs for his family Christmas gifts that year.\" noncompliant elevators \"Occupational safety and health adminis- tration compliance isn't my job,\" our GMP Agent-In-Place chuckled. \"So when I saw two employees in a clinch in our freight- only elevator (employees are not allowed to use it), I didn't worry about it. I also didn't tell their spouses.\" Super blank slate \"One employee held several positions within our site, each one more responsible than the last,\" noted our GMP Agent-In- Place. \"This was back before computers and electronic-filing systems became ubiq- uitous. When it came time to move offices, this person fit all his files in a shoebox\u2014 and most of the items were personal, not work-related. I guess he thought everything he needed would be at the new office.\" cutting up at work \"It started as a complaint of foreign de- bris present in sterile solution found at a customer's location,\" grumbled our GMP Agent-In-Place. \"We examined inspection rejects for two current batches of the same product and found similar debris, so we knew the compliant had validity. Our out- side laboratory determined that all three debris samples were identical, and that they were Tyvek. Since the Tyvek also had silicone on it, the source was determined to be the stopper bags. We sterilized our stoppers in Tyvek bags, and cut them open in the sterile suite for use. Apparently, in some cases, the operator cut twice, giving a chance for Tyvek pieces to fall into the stop- per hopper, and to be transferred to the so- lution via the inner surface of the stopper. \"To prevent recurrence, we changed the configuration of the stopper bag to use less Tyvek, making the bag more difficult to cut and prevent the need for double cutting. The operators were retrained but, unfor- tunately, the bag changes required a ster- ilization revalidation,\" our Agent finished. gone missing \"For certain biological products, a steril- ity test has to be performed for the bulk sterile material,\" our GMP Agent-In-Place explains. \"This requires that a sample be taken. On this fateful day, the sterility sam- ple for one batch was missing. The batch re- cord documented that the sample had been taken and signed for, but the sample could not be found. The sterility test could not be completed and the batch was rejected. It was suspected that the samples were wait- ing for seals to be transferred into the filling area, and were inadvertently discarded.\" environmental error \"I hate computers,\" complained our GMP Agent-In-Place. \"I had to review the valida- tion for changes to our enterprise manage- ment system and found that five different scripts were tested in the wrong system en- vironment. We have environments labeled sandbox, development, quality, validation, production, and more. Each one is set up on a separate computer server and uses different software. There was a deviation covering these cases, and the documenta- tion said the cases were rerun in the cor- rect environment, but that was inadequate. For example, the response did not identify how the error was determined nor did it offer assurance that the error was limited to the five listed scripts. In the end, we had to check all the scripts. We realized that our initial training of some contract employees was lax in this regard, and was corrected before the next validation runs.\" PTTaking a trip\u2014to a new site or down memory lane\u2014may not get you where you want to go.Movin' on Out Pharmaceutical Technology's month- ly \"Agent-in-Place\" column distills true-life cautionary tales from the files of Control, a senior compli- ance officer.

Report from: Asia Asia's biomanufacturing industry has a lot to live up to in the coming years. A Business Moni- tor International (BMI) report projects that Asia's share of global biopharmaceutical manufac- turing facilities alone will double between 2009 and 2013, growing from 10% to 20% of global market share. Asian contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) are most likely to benefit from the growth. Multinational companies are looking to outsource in order to combat esca- lating costs at home. To compete, Asian CMOs are making fast strides to comply with FDA and EMA standards and requirements. contin. on page 20Jane for PharmTech.comIN THE FIELD contin. from page 18 To date, India has the highest number of FDA-certified manufacturing facilities and more than four times the num- ber of drug-manufacturing staff than does the United States (India has more than 12 times the number of manufacturing staff than the United Kingdom). Also, China is working hard to address its intellectual property (IP) rights issues. In 2007, the government issued 53 regulations related to drug-approval process improvement and shortened its timeframe for inves- tigational new drugs by half. Industry players have also expressed confidence in Asian developed countries such as South Korea and Singapore. These countries have well-established manufacturing environments and promising government initiatives. For example, Singa- pore's biomedical integrated strategy, launched in June 2000, has attracted big players, including Lonza and Novartis, to set up shop in its country. In June 2011, Lonza committed an additional $12.2 (CHF$10) million to further expand its Singapore plant in response to the country's positive economic growth and the government's continued support for the bio- pharmaceutical manufacturing sector. To keep up with the ongoing and expected growth in bio- pharmaceutical manufacturing, domestic Asian CMOs are implementing a few changes to attract more global attention, including partnerships and investment. Upgrading technology In recent years, many pharmaceutical companies have shifted their focus from straight manufacturing to innovation, pro- ductivity, and quality control. Use of new technologies that are cost-effective and require minimal maintenance is growing more than ever before. Single-use technology, or disposables, in particular, is becoming more popular among CMOs based in Asia. The technology makes CMOs more attractive because it reduces production complexity and extends the range of services that can be offered to global customers. Jay Chandran, associate research director of the healthcare division Asia Pacific for Frost & Sullivan, says, \"[Single-use technology] will gain popularity in Asia in due course as it becomes a mandatory manufacturing capability to have if manufacturers want to remain competitive in the export markets of North America and Europe. Collaboration with large international players will further encourage the use of this technology in Asia.\" In 2008, San Diego-based Pacific Biopharma Group and PacificGMP partnered to establish a single-use facility called China Quantitative Biomedicine in Taizhou, China. The facil- ity will manufacture proteins for the US and European mar- kets, and aims to meet the rising demands in Asia. Unique partnerships Four to five years ago, the way to gain access to biomanu- facturing was by outsourcing to CMOs through traditional procurement processes, or by building or acquiring facilities to assert control in supply. In recent years, there has been a para- digm shift toward merger-and-acquisition (M&A) strategies. Michael Banks, head of sales and business development for biological manufacturing at Lonza, says, \"The strategies are diverse, including local or CMO-border partnerships, outsourcing strategy, and manufacturing optimization. As it has a lot to do with increased cost pressure, the shift is a result of accumulative technical experience and maturing of technologies.\" Interestingly, many companies outside the pharmaceutical business are taking a plunge into the biomanufacturing mar- ket as well. In February 2011, Japan's Fujifilm announced that it will acquire Merck's Biomanufacturing Network for $490 million. South Korea's Samsung established a joint venture with Quintiles (Durham, North Carolina), whereby the latter will commit $30 million to support Samsung's entry into the biopharmaceutical market. The move by these high-tech companies bears significance for the industry. \"These are positive CMO-industrial moves for the biologics market,\" says Banks. \"In the long run, it will strengthen the biomanufacturing value chain and fuel a full- fledged regional supply chain involving raw materials, talent, and various adjacent CMO establishments. These ancillary factors will further encourage the growth of the Asian innova- tor's pipeline and contribute significantly to the health of the global biopharma market in the near future.\" Training and education A key challenge facing the biomanufacturing business in Asia is gaining access to an experienced workforce. According to Banks, \"Biomanufacturing is a young sector and a people busi- ness. It is therefore important to develop, troubleshoot, and optimize the processes, and ensure know-how and expertise to achieve timely delivery and cost effectiveness.\" To get ahead in this area, Lonza, for instance, has trained the majority of its workforce under the Strategic Attachment and Training program with the Singapore Economic Develop- ment Board in Singapore. Conclusion Overall, the biologics market is predicted to be next area of growth in Asia and globally as companies aim to compensate for their potential loss of revenues from current small-mole- cule blockbusters. Many companies have already embarked on biologics programs, facility establishments, and related partnerships and acquisitions. Flexibility will be crucial, says Banks. \"It is important to address to both market and tech- nological demands. As a biomanufacturer, it is imperative to consider market segments and production demand instead of focusing only on blockbuster drug development and orphan drugs,\" he says.

Approximately 7000 such diseases, including certain congenital conditions and rare cancers, exist in the US, and they affect nearly 25 million Americans. New drug applications for these diseases can be submitted simultaneously to FDA and EMA and receive priority review under orphan-drug provisions, and multiple grant programs exist for rare-disease re- search. For years, many bio/pharmaceu- tical companies have turned a blind eye to developing products for rare diseases because such medicines have a small con- sumer base, and thus fall short of meeting desired revenues. Efforts to pay attention to these conditions and find cures for them, however, are gaining momentum. Why now? According to Steve Groft, di- rector of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Rare Diseases Research, industry and regulators have reached a point where guidance can be provided in this area. \"There has not been tremen- dous interest in rare disease research and treatments until the past 5 to 8 years,\" he explains. \"There was some interest in the 1980s after the Orphan Drug Act was passed in the US, but then we had the con- solidation of the pharma industry, which led to an emphasis on larger blockbuster drugs. In 2000, Europe developed its or- phan-drug legislation, and that stimulated more product development in this area. Today, industry realizes there are niche markets available for rare-disease treat- ments and that it can be a profitable mar- ket. There is increased interaction between the scientific and the patient-advocacy communities. And, most important, we are now able to look at results of years of basic research on rare diseases and better understand them,\" he says.Groft is part of a unique project that began in October 2010 to develop a diag- nostic tool for most known rare diseases. Known as the International Rare Disease Research Consortium, NIH and the Euro- pean Commission are leading the global scientific community to find treatments for the world's most disregarded medical syndromes and conditions. The consortium's first target is no drop in the bucket\u2014the goal is to find new therapies for 200 rare diseases by the year 2020. \"There is no list of targeted diseases yet,\" says Groft. \"This is the master goal. We're just beginning to identify possible compounds and diseases that may be con- sidered\u2014some may be used for multiple diseases\u2014and to enter them into clinical studies.\" The project involves research and development into new molecular entities as well as looking at already approved drugs to see whether they can be repur- posed for rare diseases and made available to new populations. \"Currently, only 10 to 20 products are approved per year for all diseases, and we feel there is a need to do better than that,\" adds Groft. To meet its goal, the consortium would like to see harmonization of clinical tri- als for small patient populations and the standardization of trial-data collection. \"We need global acceptance of how to do the trials, and we need patients from many different countries to have enough to com- plete a study more quickly. We're trying to develop a plan and process that people can use to coordinate efforts to better minimize redundant research,\" explains Groft. If research-data collection efforts can be standardized in a common proto- col, drug-product developers will be able to use and submit that data to regulatory agencies in a much easier way\u2014and the regulatory authorities will receive better research results to evaluate. Common data elements can also pro- vide a framework for patient registries to be developed and, looking ahead, says Groft, scientists may be able to use that in- formation for natural-history studies and to develop biomarkers for clinical trials. \"We should be able to do the same thing for rare diseases that is being done for can- cers and for HIV/AIDS products,\" he says. Public communication and distribution of the information are also part of the plan. The consortium plans to build on al- ready existing models for some rare dis- eases that have received more attention than others over the years, such as cer- tain muscular dystrophy conditions and cystic fibrosis. \"These discovery de- velopment efforts have taken a global ap- proach, and we can use those as examples and build on those successes,\" says Groft. For example, the consortium would like to have the same analytical tools available on all project-relevant clinical-trial sites and the services of a data-coordination center. NIH is also working with FDA to create a national policy for rare-disease research and related drug regulation. FDA boosted its own rare-disease efforts this past year with a newly created position in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, an As- sociate Director for Rare Diseases, and the launch of a free searchable database that lists approved compounds and products that may help researchers in their search for treatments for rare diseases. \"Overall, this is an opportunity to facilitate partner- ships,\" says Groft. \"We've been talking about rare diseases for years. Individu- als have been developing many of these pieces, and now is the appropriate time to put all those pieces together. The result should be a larger number of products available for the rare-disease community.\" For more information, contact NIH's Dr. Groft (stephen.groft@nih.gov) or the EC's Catherine Berens (Catherine.BE- RENS@ec.europa.edu).

A proposal is on the table to increase drug rebates under Medicare Part D as a means of controlling the overall costs of the Medicare program. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) is opposed to such measures, concerned that a decrease in revenues could damage a healthy and growing industry and that the ripple-effects from a slowdown in biopharmaceutical growth could negatively impact an already fragile economy. In a press release, PhRMA president and CEO John J. Castellani issued the following statement: \"At a time when the [US] is facing a jobs crisis, evidenced by the terrible employment numbers from last Friday, it is critical that our policymakers embrace dynamic and innova- tive business sectors such as the biopharmaceutical research sector and refrain from stifling job growth through shortsighted proposals such as government-mandated price controls in Medicare Part D. \" PhRMA cited a newly-released report to back its assertions. The report, commissioned by PhRMA and conducted by Battelle Technology, an independent research organization, exam- ined the direct, indirect, and induced impacts of the biopharmaceutical industry on the US economy. Direct impacts are defined as the specific impact of biopharmaceutical sector expen- ditures in the first round of spending. Indirect impacts are the impact of expenditures by suppli- ers to the biopharmaceutical sector, and induced impacts are the additional economic impact of the spending of biopharmaceutical sector employees and suppliers' employees in the overall economy that can be attributed to the direct biopharmaceutical industry expenditures. The report found that the industry directly creates 674,000 jobs and supports an additional 3.4 million indirect and induced jobs. It directly generates $19.8 billion in state, local, and federal taxes, and including indirect and induced sources, generates around $85 billion in tax revenue. The finding that there is a large multiplier effect, that expenditures and losses by the biophar- maceutical industry are magnified by impacts on the other industries it supports, leads to the report's conclusions that a change in revenue (up or down) of $20 billion would result in a change in the economy as a whole of $58 billion. According to Castellani, \"The bottom line is we are at a critical time for our economy. We have to create jobs, not lose more. We have to support innovation, not interfere with the most inno- vative sectors of our economy. We must continue to improve the health of America's seniors, not increase costs and erect barriers to promising scientific breakthroughs. \"Do you think shared audits can be a tool to help manage the pharma- ceutical supply chain? 71% Yes 9% No 17% Maybe 4% Don't know Vote and view other online polls at: PharmTech.com/polls\u00bbPharmTech Poll CSR and sustainability forum Pharmaceutical Technology's Sourcing and Management eNewsletter provides specialized coverage of the bio/pharmaceutical industry's activities in corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability as well as developments from other business sectors, government organizations, professional, trade, and scientific associations, and nongovernmental organizations.

Companion diagnostics are used to help healthcare professionals determine whether a patient with a particular dis- ease or condition should receive a par- ticular drug therapy or how much of the drug to give, according to the press release about the guidance. In addition to defining a companion diagnostic and its use, the draft guidance calls for early engagement between FDA and manufacturers so that the agency's expectations can be included in devel- opment plans, and states that FDA will aim to conduct simultaneous reviews of a drug or biologic therapy and its cor- responding companion diagnostic. The document also notes instances in which the agency may approve a targeted medicine in the absence of a cleared or approved companion diagnostic (e.g., in cases where the therapy is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening dis- ease or condition for which there is no available or satisfactory treatment and when the potential benefits outweigh the risks of not having a cleared or approved companion diagnostic, states the release). Comments on the draft guidance are due Sept. 12, 2011. \u2014Angie DrakulichNow assembling products your way.Because we offer custom assemblies, we're able to tailor our products to give your company exactly what it needs.

Through a human-machine interface, operators can set timers to control the lighting, motion, pH, and temperature within the bioreac- tor. An in-line DC motor connected to a PTFE stirrer controls the motion within the unit. The motor can oper- ate at low speeds for gentle agitation that provides good oxygen transfer without damaging fragile cells. Users can easily remove the motor by ad- justing one thumbscrew. The system monitors and controls pH through an automatic carbon- dioxide valve. A separate probe moni- tors the temperature of the vessel. Users can connect the outer jacket to a recirculation bath for optimal tem- perature control. A glass sparger tube provides constant oxygen transfer and mixes carbon dioxide. The 10-L biore- actor can be used as a modeling tool for scale-up applications and can be customized for specific applications.Inspection tool detects defects Cognex's In-Sight Explorer 4.5 inspection tool includes an all-in-one edge- and surface- inspection tool, and an all-in-one bead-width and position tool. The software's identification- code tool reads multiple codes at one time, thus allowing In-Sight cameras to read barcodes and provide inspections simultaneously. The product's Flexible Flaw Detection (FFD) edge- and surface-inspection tool is suitable for color and grayscale applications. The FFD tool inspects for boundary defects, such as conformity of shape, and surface de- fects, such as stains and scratches. FFD can also perform print inspections (e.g., inspect- ing screened logos for defects). FFD gives users the flexibility to select accuracy and speed requirements, and to ignore defects during system run time. The In-Sight Explorer 4.5 product also includes two EasyBuilder user-interface tools. The Bead Finder and Bead Tracker tools find positional defects and width- based defects and gaps, and also provide bead data needed for process control.In-Sight Explorer 4.5 inspection tool Cognex www.cognex.comAutomation, already a fact of life in the pharmaceutical industry, has become even more important now that many manufacturers must reduce costs to remain competitive.

Because of the potential fo r consumer harm from intentional adul - teration, fraud, and counterfeiting, thes e developments require major changes i n the way FDA does business. Instead o f sending inspectors abroad to scrutiniz e foreign facilities or trying to examine mor e products at US borders than before, agenc y officials seek to collaborate more with othe r regulatory authorities, to make greater us e of third-party auditors, and to establis h global-information networks that can bet - ter alert officials to potential safety hazards . The call for a new approach to food an d drug regulation will have a notable impac t on FDA field inspections and complianc e operations. The Office of Complianc e (OC) in FDA's Center for Drug Evaluatio n and Research (CDER) has reorganized t o heighten its focus on supply chain and in - ternational issues. At the same time, manu - facturers are supporting new approache s and collaborative efforts to prevent dru g theft, diversion, and distribution of coun - terfeit products around the world. Thes e changes also reflect FDA's need to cop e with increasingly tight resources at gov -ernment agencies and healthcare organi - zations. FDA faces a potential $250-millio n reduction in its budget for fiscal year 2012 , which begins Oct. 1, 2011, as Congres s moves to cut funding for most federa l programs. Such a cut would severely limi t funds for FDA field inspections in all re - gions and limit the increased oversight o f food producers and imports that has bee n mandated by new food-afety legislation . Global challenge s The lines between domestic and foreig n production are increasingly blurred. Th e difficulties of ensuring the safety and qual - ity of imported food and drugs in such a world are outlined in the report, \"Path - way to Global Product Safety and Qual - ity,\" which FDA Commissioner Margare t Hamburg unveiled in June 2011. Althoug h the report contains few really new propos - als for overseeing food and drug import s and outsourced production, the documen t is noteworthy for providing a comprehen - sive overview of the forces reshaping bio - pharmaceutical product development . In the face of pressure to cut costs an d increase productivity, pharmaceutica l companies are shifting manufacturin g to foreign locations and searching for les s expensive ingredients. The cost of formu - lating an active pharmaceutical ingredi - ent (API) is 15% to 40% less expensive i n India, than in the US. Consequently, dru g manufacturers now import 80% of APIs , primarily from China and India. Import s of pharmaceutical products have increase d about 13% per year for the past seven years . This shift is boosting the US trade defici t in pharmaceutical products, which ha s jumped from less than $2 billion in 200 0 to $18 billion in 2008 . Additional overseas outsourcing, how -ever, fragments the drug-production pro - cess. Contract manufacturing has mor e than doubled during the past decade t o an estimated $46 billion business in 2010 . China and India now have the largest num - ber of foreign, FDA-registered drug manu - facturing establishments. These and othe r emerging nations also are producing mor e complex, high-risk biologics, and vaccine s and are becoming more prominent in bio - pharmaceutical research and developmen t (R&D). India and China already have mor e than 30% of the world's drug master files , and more clinical trials are taking place i n these regions. With a growing volume o f foreign manufacturers and producers t o monitor, FDA concedes that it is not viabl e to scale up its current regulatory model , even if it had the resources to do so . These developments inevitably ope n the door to more economically-motivate d abuse, drug counterfeiting, fraud, and in - tentional adulteration.

Americans feed illegal operators, moreover, by purchasing pharmaceuticals online, often from unknown sources and without oversight and safeguards. Call for collaboration In response, FDA proposes a more col- laborative regulatory approach, somewhat along the lines of the International Civil Aviation Organization, which promotes common global standards for aviation safety. Another model is information sharing, promoted by the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol). Access to international data on manufac- turers, pharmaceutical suppliers, and regu- latory operations would help FDA identify potential risks that can be monitored and addressed before they lead to public harm. Although FDA has been engaging for- eign regulatory counterparts in collabora-tive initiatives as well as in joint inspection and information-sharing pilot programs, these partnerships \"are not sufficient\" to deal with an increasingly complex global environment, the report concedes. What is needed are \"global coalitions of regula- tors\" that allow countries to maintain sov- ereignty in setting standards and making decisions, but rely more on the work of other regulators and encourage the pooling of resources to manage the global pharma- ceutical inventory. Increased information sharing with trusted counterparts would be easier if FDA did not need to redact all trade secret information from documents, for example, a process that seriously sty- mies the communications process. Such collaboration reflects FDA's recog- nition that its own inspectors cannot reach the growing volume of foreign sites: The average cost of a foreign-plant inspection is $52,000, more than twice the $23,000 outlay for a domestic site visit. More than 54% of foreign drug making facilities went uninspected from 2002 to 2007, and the record is even worse for foreign medical device producers. Even though FDA in- creased foreign-drug inspections by 27% between 2007 and 2009 and opened a se- ries of international offices, that still falls hopelessly short of covering the field. The good news is that collaborative ini- tiatives are proliferating as regulators seek to conserve their own resources. Mexico and Costa Rica, for example, are accept- ing FDA medical-device review decisions. FDA recently put a company on import alert based on an inspection report from a European agency, and is exploring other ways to streamline operations. EMA reli- ance on \"qualified persons\" employed by drug manufacturers to verify the quality and safety of all approved drug batches is an approach worth looking at, says OC Di- rector Deborah Autor*. She's also interested in models for third-party audits for drugs, an option already authorized by FDA for medical devices and food imports. A shift to more reliance on outside auditors, how- ever, requires a more sophisticated review and monitoring infrastructure that can verify the integrity of information received from other regulators and private parties.

The World Bank is providing resources for building regula- tory capacity in developing economies so that less-experienced agencies can bet- ter enforce GMPs and other drug quality policies. The US Pharmacopeia similarly is providing technical assistance to help emerging-nation manufacturers comply with GMPs, along with support for regu- latory authorities to establish quality drug- surveillance programs. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) funds this $35 million, 5-year program, which now is active in about 30 countries in Af- rica, Asia, and Latin America. A major impetus for regulatory capacity building comes from donor and health funding organizations, such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, which increasingly require the drugs they purchase to meet GMPs and World Health Organization prequalification standards. Pharmaceutical companies also are working together to prevent product theft and adulteration and to provide more ef- ficient ways to oversee suppliers and con- tractors. The Rx-60 consortium aims to ensure product quality through coopera- tive auditing of suppliers and contractors. More than 50 pharmaceutical, biotech, and supplier companies are participating in the Rx-360 shared audit program, which uses third-party auditors to examine operations and standards at producers of active ingre- dients, excipients, and other raw materials. The program encourages companies to provide their own audits of suppliers. Separately, several organizations mar- ket third-party audit and certification programs for excipients. A new track- and-trace consortium of manufacturers, distributors, pharmacists, and shippers is Pharmaceutical manufacturers and regulators in the US, Europe, and Japan are bringing regulatory authorities and health organizations from other regions under the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) umbrella. When ICH was established in 1990, most pharmaceutical research and development, and manufacturing took place in the EU, the US, and Japan, observed Mike Ward, director for international programs at the Health Canada Therapeutic Products Directorate. The pharmaceutical world has changed greatly in the past 20 years, making it important to reduce country and regional differences in technical requirements for medicines, he commented at an FDA public meeting in June 2011 that discussed ICH expert working-group activities. ICH began inviting more \"interested parties\" to participate in expert working groups several years ago and established a Regulators Forum in 2008 to communicate ICH policies to authorities in emerging countries such as China, India, and Brazil. The ICH Global Cooperation Group now broadly transmits ICH deliberations and decisions. Active regulatory authorities and regional harmonization initiatives, such as the Association of the Southeast Asian Nations and the Pan American Network for Drug Regulatory Harmonization, may become regular expert working group participants. \"The continued success and relevance of ICH,\" says Justina Molzon, associate director for international programs within CDER at FDA, \"will depend on a much broader use of ICH guidelines and standards.\" ICH spreads global standards Sponsored by: Pharmaceutical Technology August 2011 33Washington Report working with FDA to develop standards for an interoperable prescription-drug tracking system. The impetus comes from California ePedigree requirements, which are scheduled to begin in 2015. Expanding compliance With drug manufacturing and clinical- trial activities expanding overseas and at home, CDER's Office of Compliance is being reshaped into a \"super\" office that can better manage its growing responsibili- ties. OC now has a staff of 300, compared with 118 in 2005, explained OC Deputy Director Ilissa Bernstein at the Parenteral Drug Association pharmaceutical supply- chain conference in June. Now a string of top aides manages cross-cutting initiatives, including policy and communications, strategic planning and organization de- velopment, data analysis, and risk assess- ment, directly under OC Director Autor. These staff functions incorporate many of the data-management responsibilities of the former Division of Compliance Risk Management and Surveillance. The main new OC component is the Of- fice of Drug Security, Integrity, and Recalls (ODSIR), which will oversee import opera- tions, recalls, and a range of supply-chain issues. An Import Operations branch will coordinate import and export compliance activities, including supplies for clinical and preclinical studies. The Division of Supply Chain Integrity (DSCI) will handle anticounterfeiting strategies, track-and- trace initiatives, product authentication, good importer practices, good distribution practices, cargo-theft prevention, inten- tional adulteration, and efforts to leverage domestic and international partnerships in these areas, explained Leigh Verbois, who will serve as the DSCI deputy director. Among other responsibilities, ODSIR Acting Associate Director Connie Jung will continue to lead agency efforts to de- velop track-and-trace programs, building on guidance issued in March 2010 that outlines how manufacturers should pro- vide a standard numerical identifier (SNI) on every product as the basis for tracking products through the supply chain. FDA is digesting comments from a February 2011 public workshop on how to develop interoperable standards that will facilitate adoption of pedigrees and tracking sys- tems, hopefully in time to help manufac- turers meet California requirements. With this reorganization, OC's status is similar to that of CDER's Office of New Drugs, Office of Pharmaceutical Science, and Office of Surveillance and Epidemiol- ogy. Most OC divisions will function as be- fore, though with slightly revised names. The Office of Manufacturing and Product Quality (OMPQ) will no longer oversee recalls and shortages, but continues to manage inspections for new and generic drugs and biologics, both domestic and international, to ensure compliance with GMPs. The Office of Unapproved Drugs and Labeling Compliance (OUDLC) over- sees drug fraud and labeling and approval requirements for prescription and over- the-counter drugs. The Office of Scientific Investigations (OSI), which monitors clini- cal trial operations, bioequivalence testing, and patient protections, gains a new divi- sion of safety compliance with responsibil- ity for postmarketing activities, including adverse event reporting and risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS) . The global market \"contains a vast amount of counterfeit and substandard drugs,\" Bernstein commented at the PDA conference, noting the need for more trans- parency and accountability in the supply chain, both upstream and downstream. OMPQ Associate Director Richard Friedman emphasized that company management is ultimately responsible for ensuring product quality, including use of safe and reliable raw materials and effec- tive monitoring of outsourced activities. A significant reason for the OC reorganiza- tion, Autor explains, \"is to recognize the challenges of globalization\" and to be able to focus more on international collabora- tion, data mining, and risk analytics. \"It fits together nicely and it's the right direction for us to move in.\" PT *As we went to press, FDA announced a major reorganization of the Commissioner's office, with Autor becoming FDA Deputy Commissioner for Global Regulatory Operations and Policy.

These realities include expiring patents, competition from generic drugs, and more demanding regulations that expect new drug applications to focus on targeted therapeutics that rely on biomarkers to identify likely responders. As a result, pharmaceutical companies are changing many aspects of their business model, including how drugs are discovered, devel- oped, manufactured, and sold (see Table I). The result is a sweeping shift toward personalized medicines that rely on disease-profiling technologies and retooled pharmaceutical capabilities. Research and development (R&D) and product devel- opment will need to adapt more quickly to new disease-profiling techniques (e.g., genomics, proteomics, and metabolo- mics) and disease models, and dynamic-system pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis) by integrating an ecosystem of R&D partners. These new R&D practices will need to validate and characterize hypotheses around novel dis- ease pathways and mechanisms of action rather than rely as heavily on hypothesis- free, high-throughput target analysis. By using the latest profiling technologies to identify likely responders, researchers will be able to conduct smaller, shorter, more focused, and less expensive clinical trials. Development teams will need to inte-grate a group of experts, including molec- ular biologists, geneticists, informaticists, process scientists, instrument software/ hardware engineers, sales and marketers, medical-affairs specialists, and regulatory experts to synchronize drug and compan- ion diagnostic development and launch. Effective orchestration of these experts, practices, and technologies will require ad- vanced product-development capabilities. Manufacturing organizations will need to coordinate the production of drug products and companion diagnos- tic kits. Given smaller patient populations for each targeted molecule, drug manu- facturers will adapt their high-volume operations to smaller volume operations that entail more frequent equipment changeovers, cleaning, and product-line clearances. Drug manufacturers will need to partner with and manage outsourced companion diagnostic kit manufactur- ers, which involves ensuring high-quality internal drug-manufacturing operations and outsourced diagnostic kit manufac- turing. With more operating complex- ity, greater controls will be required of manufacturing, operations, including production controls, material handling, environmental monitoring, drug and kit storage and handling, and drug-device batch-record review. The path to personalized medicine will require a capability to manage a complex, integrated set of capabilities across a broad ecosystem of partners; however, the clinical outcomes and lower overall development costs will justify the means.

One might think so given the June 13, 2011 article in the Chicago Tribune on using the game of poker to train stockbrokers in the nature of risk (1). In the pharmaceutical industry, the reception of International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines Q8, Q9, and Q10 has led to widespread discus- sion, if not implementation, of the Qual- ity Trio guidelines, with ICH Q9 spe- cifically addressing risk management. While it is perhaps too early to say that risk management has gone main- stream, it has certainly had its fair share of news coverage of late. Due to a rare 9.0 magnitude earthquake and an unprecedented 45-ft tsunami that washed over the nuclear power plant in Fukushima, three out of six reactor cores melted down\u2014the worst possible outcome. It will take decades and bil- lions of yen to clean up. The world was stunned by that event. If a highly-regulated industry run by a detail-oriented and meticu- lous culture such as Japan made this mistake, what chance do the rest of us have at risk management? Which raises the questions, what are the risks in risk management and can we reduce them? First it is important to define terms. In ICH Q9, risk to a patient equals probability times severity. What is probability? We can do little better than this observation from Bernoulli in 1713: \"For it should be presumed that a particular thing will occur or not occur in the future as many times as it has been observed, in similar circumstances, to have occurred or not occurred in the past.\" \u2014D. Bernouilli This definition has been refined since then. Here are the three common defi- nitions given: An undefined subjective measure of belief from personal estimate, gut feeling or intuition The observed frequency of out- comes, as a fraction, percentage or a proportion A theoretical characteristic of the situation as determined by the limiting frequency of an infinite random series. I note with concern and dismay that ICH Q9 does not include probability in the list of definitions. Perhaps the authors assume that everyone has the same uni- versal understanding of this complex topic, so a definition is not needed. Severity is the second component of risk and is defined in ICH Q9 as \"a measure of the possible consequences of a hazard\" (i.e., a meltdown). Now, let's turn to key steps for mitigating the risk in risk management.Include top management. They can delegate work but not the responsibility of a mission critical process. Note that risk management is a not an event but an ongoing reevaluation. Management must fight the danger of complacency, distraction, and stagnation. Risk anal- ysis cannot simply become window dressing for the regulators. Risk reduc- tion is costly, and management reflects the importance of the task with sup- port, finances, and resources. At least one person in the risk team must understand probability well enough to teach it to the other mem- bers. Few people have studied probabil- ity and even fewer have practical ex- perience of using probability. Real life probability estimation is much more difficult than textbook exercises. Yet, probability theory is the core of deter- mining risk. Risk assessment cannot be seen as a check-the-box activity; it is a seri- ous issue and requires serious effort and commitment. The success of the assessment is a direct result of the skill, education, and experience of the company's team members. Technical experts are absolutely necessary even if external experts must be called in. All stakeholders must work to agreement. Industry in general is less interested in the risk of an everyday occurrence, such as the risk of failing the moisture test for the next production run. What is more important is estimating risks contin. on page 39A firm grasp of probability and ongoing re-evaluation are key in mitigating risk.Lynn D. TorbeckReducing the Risk in Risk Management Lynn D. Torbeck is a statistician at Torbeck and Assoc., Evanston, Images/geTTY Images PharmTech.com/packPACKAGING FORUM Child-resistant (CR) packaging is typically associated with closures that require two simultaneous ac- tions (e.g., squeezing and turning or pressing and turning) or a sequence of actions. In the United States, the Consumer Product Safety Commis- sion requires CR packaging to be se- nior friendly (SF) as well. Designing a package that is both CR and SF poses significant challenges, but options are increasing. For example, pharmaceutical manu- facturers that prefer blister packaging traditionally have relied on multilayer lidstock laminations with a peelable paper layer to prevent access by chil- dren. However, some new structures are eliminating the paper layer to pro- vide easier access for adults while still protecting children. One structure incorporates layers of printed foil, adhesive, polyester, and heat-seal coating, and seals at lower temperatures than a conventional paper-polyester laminate does, thus enhancing productivity while reduc- ing the amount of heat exposure that the product experiences. Eliminating the paper layer reduces particulate contamination (easy-PIESY Lidding, Constantia Hueck Foils). A polyester-based lidstock not only eliminates the paper layer, but is avail- able in three levels of CR protection. The all-film coextrusion or coextruded film-foil structure can be configured for peel, peel-push or tool-aided access to the medication inside and can be de- signed to meet F = 1 requirements, the highest level of child resistance that the Consumer Product Safety Commission recognizes (Safety-Pak Plus PL, PP, or LT lidstock, Winpak Heat Seal Pack- aging). For form-fill-seal packaging such as stick packs, pouches, or barrier over- wraps, four standard film construc- tions provide different degrees of CR protection while maintaining senior friendliness, processability, and perfor- mance. The materials can be printed in as many as 10 colors to maximize shelf appeal. Solventless lamination options address sustainability initiatives be- cause they reduce energy consumption by 86% compared with solvent-based laminating processes. Structures com- patible with high-speed equipment also are available (Flexi-Free CR barrier overwrap film, Ampac Flexibles, a di- vision of Ampac Packaging). Another way to impart CR protec- tion is to put a non-CR blister into a CR wallet. Many wallet designs also serve as compliance packages, starter kits, or titration regimens. One patented wallet pack seals a non-CR blister into a paperboard sleeve to create a CR package (howellCRIII package, Howell Packaging). A con- figuration using paperboard with re- cycled content also has earned an F = 1 rating. At least two machines can join the blister card and paperboard. One is capable of running 50-75 packs/min (wallet pack machine, Howell Packag- ing), and another produces more than 200/min (Blister Card/Wallet Ma- chine, MGS Machine). Another wallet concept relies on an open-ended, flat paperboard carton with matching oval windows in the top and bottom panels. It also incorporates a die-cut tab in the blister to lock the card in place. Pushing the die-cut tab up unlocks the blister and allows the card to slide out. An interior stop pre- vents the card from being completely removed from the seal- or tuck-end carton. After the user removes the dose by pushing it through the lidstock, he or she slides the card back into the car- Hallie Forcinio is Pharmaceutical technology 's Packaging Forum editor, 4708 morningside Drive, Cleveland, OH 44109, tel.

Poly-coated paperboard pro- tects the carton from tearing, and the configuration is often compatible with existing blister tooling. Adult testers rated the design as easy to manipulate. Toddler testers had such difficulty with access that the package earned an F = 1 rating (F1 Easy Lock wallet, Intini Marketing). A similar pull-out-push-in design with an F = 1 rating earned praise from the Arthritis Foundation for its ease of use. The integrated carton, blis- ter card, and leaflet or insert features an easy push-through lidstock plus a calendar or set of dosing instructions to help the patient remember when to take a pill. To earn the commendation, the package underwent a series of rig- orous tests at the Georgia Institute of Technology's Research Institute, an independent laboratory that analyzes products for people with functional limitations resulting from arthritis. The study participants, who have mod- erate to severe arthritis, found the de- sign easy to use, and six out of eight participants would recommend the de- sign to friends with arthritis (Dosepak Express, MeadWestvaco). If a capsule or tablet is too fragile to be pushed through lidding material, CR protection is still possible through a folded, heat-sealable paperboard card with a perforated tab and a dual-cham- ber blister (i.e., one empty and one full chamber). To access the dose, the user tears away the paperboard tab, presses down on the empty blister chamber to break the lidstock, and tears the lidstock to free the dose in the second chamber. Suitable for clinical trials, the design also is licensed for use by the Veterans Administration (Peel Peel wallet, Intini). For sturdier doses, a similar concept starts with pressing out a perforated tab with a key, tearing the tab away to expose the foil lidstock, and pushing the pill through (3CPak, Colonial Car- ton) A low-volume version for clinical trials also is available (Key-Pak, Key- stone Folding Box). A similar paperboard wallet design with perforated tabs calls for bending the edge of the wallet to gain access to the tab. When the tab is removed, a layer of paperboard with an I-shaped die cut remains. The die cut reduces the force needed to push the pill through the lidstock and paperboard layer. The intuitive design eliminates the need for printed instructions, thus leaving more space for product infor- mation and graphics. For regimens with high pill counts, a folded double card can be housed in an open-ended, tuck-style carton. Blisters can be traditional film-foil or cold-formed foil. Ranking as the first CR and SF blister pack approved by the Canadian Standards Association, the design also meets US and European requirements for CR packaging (Bend and Peel Easy Tab wallet, Intini). Another folded-wallet design can be assembled semiautomatically or auto- matically. The booklike configuration provides ample space for product in- formation and vivid graphics (CRx Pack, Pharma Packaging Solutions, a division of Carton Service). Other designs bring CR protec- tion to injection-molded containers. Designed to be reusable, a recyclable hinged container can be sized and shaped to hold vials, blisters, aerosols, autoinjectors, patches, mists, pumps, and syringes. Releasing the lid requires two hands, one putting pressure in one area on the base of the container, and the other pressing down on latches on opposite ends of the integral lid. A ver- sion of the F = 1-rated container that holds multiple blisters could be used by pharmacies for prescriptions (Medi- Lock CR Container, Intini).

It can be sized to hanA tiny press-and-turn cap imparts child- resistant and tamper-evident properties to a single-dose tube.

Tube packaging also has CR options. One tiny cap for single-dose tubes also offers tamper-evident protection. Like many CR concepts, the closure requires a dual movement. The outer cap rotates freely unless it is pushed in to interlock with the inner cap. Pressing and turn- ing releases an inner pin and opens the tube at a defined breaking point, while the cap remains on the tube body dur-ing dispensing. An ergonomic nozzle enables precise application of the liq- uid or cream without allowing the contents to be contaminated. The de- sign is certified as CR and suitable for adults according to testing carried out in accordance with 16 CFR 1700.20 and EN 14375. Applications include topi- cal treatments, dietary supplements, concentrates or laboratory substances, product samples, and travel-size prod- ucts (Twist'n'Use CR Polyfoil tube, Neopac).For larger tubes, CR closures are available in a diameter of 18 mm (CR Tube-Lok closure, Berry Plastics).

China and India continue to be targets of investment, particularly through alliances or joint ventures, and investments are being made in Russia and Brazil as well. Company activity Pfizer. Pfizer is continuing a restruc- turing of its manufacturing network, which was announced in May 2010, as part of its integration plan following its $68-billion acquisition of Wyeth in 2009. As of Dec. 31, 2010, Pfizer operated plants in 76 locations on a global basis with major manufacturing facilities in Belgium, China, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Singapore, and the continental United States. The company's plant network strategy calls for the exit of nine sites during the next several years, according to the company's 2010 annual filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Pfizer's strategy, as detailed in May 2010, includes plans to discontinue op- erations at three solid-dosage sites in Caguas, Puerto Rico; Loughbeg, Ireland; and Rouses Point, New York. Pfizer also announced plans to phase out pharma- ceutical solid-dosage manufacturing in Guayama, Puerto Rico, but that site will expand its consumer-healthcare op- erations. Reductions are planned at two other solid-dosage facilities in Illertissen, Germany, and Newbridge, Ireland. Two aseptic facilities that make sterile injectable medicines were targeted for exit: Dublin, Ireland, and Carolina, Puerto Rico. Pfizer also announced changes to its bio- pharmaceutical-manufacturing network. The company said it planned to exit opera- tions in Shanbally, Ireland, and Pearl River, New York. The Pearl River site, however, will remain Pfizer's center of excellence for vaccine research and development (R&D). Biotechnology plants in Sanford, North Carolina, Andover, Massachusetts, and Havant, United Kingdom, are expected to see reductions. Pfizer reported plans to cease produc- tion of consumer-healthcare products at its plant in Richmond, Virginia, but consumer healthcare R&D operations will continue in Richmond. The timing of specific exits will depend upon the complexity of operations, the amount of time needed for product transfers, and other business requirements, said Pfizer in a May 2010 press release. In outlining the changes to its manu- facturing network, Pfizer also summa- rized how its transformed manufacturing network will look.

Its biotechnology- manufacturing network will consist of sites in Grange Castle, Strangnas, Sweden; Algete, Spain; Havant, United Kingdom; Andover, Massachusetts; and Sanford, North Carolina. The consumer healthcare network will include plants in Guayama, Puerto Rico; Montreal, Canada; Albany, Georgia; Aprilia, Italy; Hsinchu, Taiwan; and Suzhou, Jiangsu, China. Pfizer added to its manufacturing network in February 2011, when it ac- quired the specialty pharmaceutical company King Pharmaceuticals. As of December 2010, King Pharmaceuticals had manufacturing facilities in Bris- tol, Tennessee; Rochester, Michigan; Middleton, Wisconsin; and St. Peters- burg, Florida, as well as an auto-injector manufacturing facility in St. Louis, ac- cording to King Pharmaceuticals' 2010 SEC annual filing. Pfizer is further expanding its manufac- turing position in emerging markets, prin- cipally through alliances. In China, Pfizer signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceuti- cal in July 2011 for a possible joint venture, which will include manufacturing coop- eration, local and global sales and market- ing infrastructure, and R&D of off-patent medicines. In April 2011, Pfizer signed an MOU with Shanghai Pharmaceutical for a potential partnership for the registration and commercialization of innovative Pfizer products in China. The companies also are examining cooperation in distribution, commercialization, R&D, manufacturing, and equity investment. In South America, Pfizer acquired a 40% stake in Laborat\u00f3rio Teuto Brasileiro a generic-drug company in Brazil in November 2010. Sanofi. In 2010, Sanofi invested nearly EUR 1.2 billion ($1.72 billion) to increase capacity and improve produc- tivity at various production and R&D sites, according to the company's 2010 SEC annual filing. In Europe, the com- pany invested in two new production lines at its facility in Frankfurt for Lan- tus (insulin glargine).

In the US, the company is in- vesting in epiCard, a gas-powered sin- gle dose, single-use autoinjector with audible user instructions for injecting of epinephrine, which is indicated for treating severe allergic reactions. In France, Sanofi is proceeding with its Biolaunch project, which is designed to convert its chemical production fa- cilities to biotechnology-based ones. The project includes a plan for a pro- duction facility for monoclonal an- tibodies at its site in Vitry-sur-Seine, which is expected to be completed by 2012, plus further investments to create a new biosynthetic process at its sites in Elbeuf and Vertolaye to improve corti- costeroid production competitiveness. Sanofi has several projects in emerg- ing markets. In China, the company is expanding its manufacturing facility in Beijing by installing assembly and packaging lines for SoloStar, a prefilled injection pen used to administer the company's Lantus insulin product. In Hangzhou, China, Sanofi is building a new manufacturing site, scheduled to be completed in 2012, to replace an existing manufacturing facility there. In Russia, Sanofi is increasing insulin capacity at its facility in Orel; the com- pany obtained the facility following its acquisition of a controlling stake in the pharmaceutical company Bioton Vostok in 2010. In Latin America, Sanofi is ex- panding its vaccine-manufacturing op- erations in Mirador, Argentina. Sanofi has made several acquisitions to increase its presence in emerging markets. The company gained indus- trial sites from its 2009 acquisitions of generic-drug companies Zentiva in Eastern Europe and Medley in Brazil. In August 2010, sanofi also acquired Nepentes, a Polish manufacturer of pharmaceuticals and dermocosmet- ics. In October 2010, Sanofi acquired a 60% equity interest in the Chinese consumer-healthcare company Hang- zhou Sanofi Minsheng Consumer Healthcare in partnership with Minsh- eng Pharmaceutical. Sanofi also acquired the Chinese specialty pharmaceutical company BMP Sunstone earlier this year. In its vaccines business, Sanofi has made several key investments during Table II: Top 50 pharmaceutical companies (Rankings 26-50).

In April 2011, Sanofi completed its $20.1-billion acquisition of the biophar- maceutical company Genzyme and gained several manufacturing facilities. In its 2010 SEC annual filing, Genzyme reported on the construction of a new manufacturing facility in Framingham, Massachusetts, which is to include four bioreactors for producing Cerezyme (miglucerase) and Fabrazyme (agalsidase beta), which had been manufactured at the company's facility in Allston Land- ing, Massachusetts. According to Gen- zyme's annual filing, it expects to receive US approval for the Framingham facility in the second half of 2011. Genyzme had transferred production of certain prod- ucts following manufacturing problems at the Allston facility and a subsequent FDA consent decree. In 2010, Genzyme transferred its fill- finish operations for Fabrazyme and Myozyme (alglucosidase alfa), 160-L, sold in the US from the Allston facility to a contract manufacturer and to Gen- zyme's Waterford, Ireland, facility. Gen- zyme is expanding its fill-finish capacity by 400% at the Waterford facility, where Cerezyme, Lumizyme (alglucosidase alfa), and Myozyme (alglucosidase alfa) are filled-finished. expects to receive product-specific approval for this addi- tional capacity beginning in late 2011. The company manufactures Lumi- zyme and Myozyme at the 4000-L biore- actor scale at a facility in Geel, Belgium. In its annual filing, Genzyme reported that it is adding a third 4000-L liter biore- actor at the facility and expects to receive approval of the additional capacity by the end of 2011. In addition, Genzyme began construction of an additional manufac- turing facility in Geel, which will include two 4000-L bioreactors for Lumizyme and Myozyme production and expects to receive approval for this new facility in late 2014. GlaxoSmithKline. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is moving ahead with a global re- structuring program that is on track to deliver a target of \u00a32.2 billion ($3.6 bil- lion) of annual savings by 2012. These savings have been extracted from GSK's developed-country sales and marketing structure, support functions, R&D, and manufacturing infrastructure. Along with these changes are increased invest- ment in emerging markets, according to the company's 2010 annual filing. In emerging markets, in June 2011, GSK agreed to acquire Shenzhen Nep- tunus Interlong Bio-Technique's stake in the companies' venture, Shenzhen GSK-Neptunus Bio- logicals, for $39 million.

In December 2010, GSK agreed to acquire the Chinese pharmaceutical company, Nanjing Mei- Rui Pharma, including a manufacturing facility in Nanjing City, Jiangsu Province, China. In Russia, GSK formed an alli- ance with JSC Binnopharm for the local secondary manufacture of several GSK vaccines. Under this alliance, which was announced in November 2010, GSK will supply bulk vaccine and provide technol- ogy and expertise to enable Binnopharm to undertake the secondary manufacture, including filling and packaging of GSK vaccines. Binnopharm will be responsible for gaining approval of their facilities to allow supply of GSK cervical cancer, rota- virus, and pneumococcal vaccines under Binnopharm's trademark for the Russian public market. In biologics, in September 2010, GSK and the Swiss custom manufacturing or- ganization Lonza formed an agreement under which Lonza will supply turing capacity ini- tially manufacture clinical-trial batches of five compounds currently in Phase I and II development and provide flexible capacity for late-stage development and commercial launch. As part of the agree- ment, GSK will work with Lonza to as- sess options for the design, specification, location, and construction of a biophar- maceutical manufacturing facility within the United Kingdom. Also, in 2010, GSK sold its Cidra, Puerto Rico, facility after the plant's closure in 2009, which followed manufacturing prob- lems and a subsequent FDA consent decree for the facility in the early 2000s. Novartis. In November 2010, Novartis defined the company's strategic focus to include pharmaceuticals, eye care, San- doz (the company's generic-drug busi- ness), consumer healthcare, vaccines, and diagnostics. In addition, Novartis plans to strengthen its commercial position in emerging markets in China, Russia, Brazil, and India. As part of its emerging-market strategy, in June 2011, Novartis broke ground for a new, $140-million phar-maceutical manufacturing plant in St. Petersburg, Russia. Once completed and approved for commercial pro- duction, which is expected in 2014, the facility will produce approxi- mately 1.5 billion oral solid dosage units per year. The facility is part of a $500-million, five-year investment into Russian healthcare infrastructure announced by Novartis in December 2010, which addresses three core areas: local manufacturing, R&D collabora- tions, and public-health development. In late 2009, Novartis announced a $1-billion, five-year investment to expand the China Novartis Institute for Biomedi- cal Research. In March 2011, Novartis completed the $125-million acquisition of an 85% stake in the Chinese vaccines com- pany Zhejiang Tianyuan Bio-Pharmaceu- tical. Novartis also is constructing a new, $300-million vaccine-manufacturing facil- ity in Goiana, Brazil. The technical startup of the facility is planned for the end of 2014. In Western Europe and the US, No- vartis is proceeding with a long-term re- development of its headquarters site in Basel, Switzerland. First begun in 2001, the goal of the project, called \"Campus,\" is to invest in R&D, corporate, and ad- ministrative activities at the site and to transfer production facilities from the site to other sites in the Basel region. Through Dec. 31, 2010, the total amount spent on the project was $1.9 billion, and the company expects to spend a total of $2.6 billion through 2015. In October 2010, Novartis announced that it would invest $600 million during the next five years to build new laboratory and office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In vaccines, Novartis is investing in a new $240-million rabies and tick-borne encephalitis vaccine-manufacturing facility in Marburg, Germany. The fa- cility is expected to open in 2012. In late 2009, Novartis opened a large-scale influenza cell-culture vaccine and ad- juvant manufacturing facility in Holly Springs, North Carolina, in partner- ship with the US Department of Health and Human Services, Biomedical Re- search and Development Authority. The total investment in the new facility is expected to be at least $900 million, partly supported by grants from the US government and previous investments in influenza cell-culture technologies at the Novartis vaccines site in Marburg. As part of an effort to optimize its man- ufacturing footprint, Novartis divested a Sandoz site in Jena, Germany, and an- nounced its exit from a Ciba Vision pro- duction site in Cidra, Puerto Rico. In April 2011, Novartis finalized its acquisition of the eye-care company Alcon. Merck. Following its $49.6-billion acquisition of Schering-Plough in late 2009, Merck & Co. began a global re- structuring program in February 2010, in which Merck announced plans to reduce its total workforce, measured at the time of the merger, by approxi- mately 17% as well as to eliminate va- cant positions at the time of the merger. The reduction comes from eliminating duplicative positions in sales, adminis- trative, and headquarter organizations as well as from the sale or closure of certain manufacturing and R&D sites. As part of that restructuring, Merck announced plans to phase out opera- tions at certain research and manu- facturing sites as well as to continue to consolidate office facilities worldwide, as outlined in the company's 2010 SEC annual filing. The eight research sites affected include those in: Montreal; Boxmeer (Ken- dall Square), Massachusetts. In the second half of 2010, Merck began phasing out operations at eight manufacturing facilities, and these sites will exit the global network as activities are transferred to other loca- tions. Merck reported plans to cease manufacturing activities at facili- ties and the company intends to sell the Mira- dor, Argentina and Miami Lakes, Flor- ida, facilities. In Singapore, chemical manufacturing will be phased out at the legacy Merck site, but it will con- tinue at the legacy Schering-Plough site. The company's pharmaceutical Pharmaceutical Technology August 2011 47manufacturing operations will continue at both Singapore facilities. In addition, manufacturing operations at the Ke- nilworth, New Jersey, site will be discontinued, and these activities will be consolidated with existing operations at other Merck facilities. Also, earlier this year, Merck sold its contract biologics manufacturing activities to Fujifilm, including its equity interests in two Merck subsidiaries, Diosynth RTP and MSD Biologics UK. These entities had facilities in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, and Billingham, United Kingdom. In emerging markets, in July 2011, Merck signed a frame- work agreement with China's Simcere Pharmaceutical Group to form a joint venture in China with the goal of building a stra- tegic partnership in development, registration, manufacturing, and sales. The initial focus of the partnership will be branded pharmaceutical products for cardiovascular and metabolic dis- eases. Simcere has seven GMP-approved manufacturing facili- ties in the Chinese provinces of Jiangsu, Hainan, Shandong, Jilin, and Anhui, according to company information. In April 2011, Merck formed a joint venture with India's Sun Pharmaceu- tical to develop, manufacture, and commercialize new combina- tions and formulations of branded generic drugs in emerging markets. Sun has 20 plants (for producing drug substances and finished products) in India, Israel, the US, Canada, Hungary, Brazil, Mexico, and Bangladesh. Roche. In November 2010, Roche announced a company- wide restructuring plan that is designed to result in annual cost savings of CHF 2.4 billion ($3.0 billion). Implementation, which is scheduled for 2011 and 2012, includes plans for re- ducing its workforce by 4800 positions worldwide. Most of the planned job reductions will occur in Roche's pharmaceuticals division, particularly in global sales and marketing organiza- tion and in manufacturing. To further improve capacity utilization within its global manufacturing network, some technical operations activi- ties will be reorganized in California, the US, Mannheim, Germany, and various other sites. In addition, Roche intends to seek buyers for its sites in Florence, South Carolina, and Boulder, Colorado. In its diagnostics group, Roche plans to close its manufacturing site in Graz, Austria, and transfer development and manufacturing activities relating to blood gas diagnostics to Rotkreuz, Switzerland, where the divi- sion's professional diagnostics unit has its global headquar- ters. Diagnostics chemical manufacturing and analytical services are expected to be discontinued in Mannheim, Germany, and transferred to Penzberg, Germany. Roche will discontinue certain activities in research and early development. These include RNA interference research in Kulmbach, Germany, Nutley, New Jersey, and Madison, Wisconsin. In addition, plans also include reorganizing cer- tain internal functions to free up resources for upcoming Phase II studies of new molecular entities. Bristol-Myers Squibb. Bristol-Myers Squibb has substantially completed its new, $750-million multiproduct bulk biolog- ics manufacturing facility in Devens, Massachusetts. The company plans to submit the site for regulatory approval in late 2011 or 2012, according to the company's 2010 SEC annual filling. The investment in the new biologics facil- ity represents the largest capital project in the company's history. BMS also reported on meeting its goal of realizing its $2.5-billion productivity transformation initiative, first announced in December 2007, which included reductions to its manufacturing operations. Other companies. Among other changes in Big Pharma man- ufacturing networks includes AstraZeneca's construction of a new $150-million manufacturing facility in the Kaluga region in Russia. In June 2011, the company also announced plans to establish a Predictive Science Center in St. Petersburg. In addition, AstraZeneca has established several partnerships with Russian development institutes, including the Skolkovo Innovation Centre and Russia Venture Company. In China, Eli Lilly is building a second manufacturing plant and dedi- cated diabetes research center. Earlier this year, Boehringer Ingelheim acquired the rights and substantially all the assets at Amgen's Fremont, California, development and manufac- turing facility. The Fremont site includes a 100,000-ft2 manu- facturing facility with a pilot plant and process-development laboratories. Boehringer Ingelheim will use the facility to en- hance its contract-manufacturing activities. The company has been a contract manufacturer for Amgen.

PHOTO COURTESY OF TRUTAG TECHNOLOGIESPharmaceutical manufacturers can choose from a variety of anticounter- feiting technologies to deal with the ever-growing problem of counterfeit drugs in the supply chain. FDA and industry experts recommend a layered approach to protecting the integrity of the supply chain, which combines technologies for antitampering, serialization, and authen- tication (in the form of overt, covert, or forensic features) applied to the packag- ing or dosage form. Analytical detection methods can confirm the authenticity of a drug product by using technologies such as portable spectrometer-based readers that authenticate in the field, thin-layer chromatography kits that quickly verify the presence and amount of active phar- maceutical ingredient (API), or analytical laboratory screening services that offer extensive testing of packaging and finished dosage forms for counterfeits. On-dose protection TruTag Technologies in Honolulu devel- oped an anticounterfeiting solution in the form of a covert silica microtag that is ed- ible, economical, heat resistant, and can be mixed into a coating, dye, or ink. The microtag is encoded with a spectral pat- tern chosen from a library of up to a tril- lion unique patterns, Peter Wong, chief operating officer of TruTag Technologies, explains. \"Therefore, our microtag is like a covert, 'edible barcode' and is as flex- ible a business tool as a traditional printed barcode,\" he says. The company's product was recently recognized as a promising new technology for anticounterfeiting by winning \"Most Likely to Succeed\" in the life sciences category at the Launch: Silicon Valley 2011 competition, an event focused on identifying emerging technol- ogy startups. The microtags, which can be applied to a solid dosage form or to packaging com- ponents, are authenticated using a por- table spectrometer-based optical reader. Wong says the company has received \"quite a bit of interest\" in applying the mi- crotags to bulk API and are open to test- ing with an interested partner. TruTag's portable readers can confirm the authen- ticity of the product through a clear blister pack, so the product does not have to be destroyed. The microtags can also link to additional information stored in a manu- facturer's database, such as e-Pedigree and track-and-trace systems. Wong says that in the company's de- velopment work, the application of the microtags has been relatively straight- forward. TruTag was able to combine small quantities of microtags with a tablet-coating mix, which was then sprayed onto solid oral dosage forms using standard industry pan coaters. Be- cause silica (silicon dioxide) is a generally- recognized-as-safe (GRAS) material, says Wong, under the framework of FDA's draft guidance, Incorporation of Physical-Chem- ical Identifiers into Solid Oral Dosage Form Drug Products for Anticounterfeiting (1), the agency's filing process may be as simple as including the addition of TruTag microtags as an annual reportable change if the prod- uct already had silica as an ingredient, or require a CBE-30 supplement if silica is a new ingredient to the product.

Moving science forward50 Pharmaceutical Technology AUGUST 2011 PharmTech.comHAZIR RX provides Near-Infrared (NIR) analysis. The analyzers are designed to support 21 CFR Part 11 compliance. No extensive training is required for opera- tion, and the devices offer a simple pass/ fail result by using proprietary algorithms for comparing authentic references with samples. Nondestructive testing can be done through clear packaging materi- als and can quickly identify substandard materials and drugs. Pharmaceutical companies and regu- latory agencies use the devices to verify raw materials and finished products, ac- cording to Duane Sword, senior director of strategic growth of Thermo Fisher Sci- entific's portable optical analysis business. \"This method provides a more significant deterrent to counterfeiters since security measures based on packaging are often easily replicated by counterfeiters, whereas imitating the exact chemical formulation of a product is extremely difficult (and not cost-effective for counterfeiters),\" he says. Advanced analytical services Another way that a drugmaker can iden- tify counterfeits in the supply chain is by using the services of an analytical labora- tory. Manufacturers send a sample of sus- pected product for testing, and the medica- tion and the packaging can be analyzed. Using Intertek's nuclear magnetic reso- nance spectroscopy (NMR) services, for example, can determine whether the API is present, and if present, at what levels. These results can show whether the sample is \"a genuine attempt to make a copy or simply a mock product with no intent to contain an active ingredient,\" says Phil Norman, vice- president of Intertek Chemicals and Phar- maceuticals Division, based in Manchester, UK. This information, says Norman, can indicate the sophistication of the counter- feit and also helps the drug manufacturer make important decisions relating to pub- lic safety. \"The investigation can also reveal if the packaging is not consistent with the reference product and potentially provide a rapid option for screening out counterfeits from the marketplace,\" he says. Sample investigation uses a range of analytical detection technologies, such as spectroscopy (NMR, Fourier trans- form infrared, NIR, spectrometry; gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; and microscopy, depending on what is the best approach for the manufacturer's specific problem. This type of advanced screening is typically used in specialized cases where a high level of detailed analysis is required, Norman says. \"These laboratory investi- gative techniques are not an alternative to portable analytical detection devices, rather they offer options for clients who require that further, more detailed step, in obtaining data to confirm that a sample is counterfeit,\" he says. Examples of these situations, he says, include cases where authorities have seized product as it is imported into a country, as well as where non-governmen- tal organizations have sourced medicines from online pharmacies as part of their own investigations, which show a high proportion of counterfeits. \"It is concern- ing to observe that a proportion of sam- ples arriving at Intertek laboratories for investigation have come from legitimate supply chains,\" he says. Conclusion Counterfeiters are hard at work find-ing ways to replicate, trick, mimic, and dodge each new technology that stands in their way. Drug companies must con- tinue to fight back with constant vigilance and new security methods to protect the pharmaceutical supply. \"The rising number of counterfeit drugs reaching even legitimate distribution chan- nels coupled with the increasing sophistica- tion of these copies, means that reliable and advanced analytical detection is a key part of a drug manufacturer's overall strategy to combat this problem,\" Norman says. Combining anticounterfeiting mea- sures designed to prevent counterfeits from reaching consumers such as anti-tamper packaging and overt authentication fea- tures, a robust serialization system, and technologies that detect the presence of adulterated and substandard medicines, drug manufacturers can work to protect their supply chains, brands, and customers.

PTSpecial Report: Analytical Detection Detection of counterfeits in developing countries One solution for detecting counterfeit pharmaceuticals in developing countries is the use of thin-layer chromatography (TLC) methods. The World Health Organization estimates that potentially more than 30% of pharmaceuticals in developing nations could be counterfeit. Portable TLC kits are economical, do not require extensive training for use, and allow for rapid screening of product in the field (1). An example of such a portable laboratory is the GPHF-Minilab, which was developed by the Global Pharma Health Fund (GPHF), a charitable organization funded by Merck KGaA. Thomas P . Layloff, PhD, senior quality assurance advisor for the Supply Chain Management System, part of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, explains the advantages of TLC in protecting consumers from counterfeit pharmaceuticals. \"The use of TLC to determine whether the right drug is present in approximately the right amount is very widespread because of ease of application, sustainability, low cost and very minimal support infrastructure required. For example, more than 300 GPHF TLC -based Minilabs have been sold and put in use all over the world. The Minilab technology requires no laboratory facilities or electricity; detection is based on visual comparisons. Since the TLC plates are single use, there is no maintenance of the chromatographic media.\" Other technologies, he says, are more expensive and require more training but are also more accurate. A limitation of TLC, for example, is that \"cogeners of the parent drug cannot be discerned by the technology, but fortunately these types of counterfeit products are expensive to manufacture and they occur in the high-cost markets such as the United States,\" he says. \"The TLC stands out for speed and cost but there is a tradeoff in the ability to detect sophisticated counterfeit products.\" To read the full Q&A with Layloff, see the expanded version of this sidebar PharmTech.com (2007).October 23-27, 2011 Washington Convention Center, Washington, DC, USA www.aapspharmaceutica.com/annualmeeting2011 AAPS Annual Meeting and ExpositionMark Your Calendars!52 Pharmaceutical Technology August 2011 PharmTech.com Organic chemists face the ongoing chal- lenge of developing and optimizing a synthesis for active pharmaceutical in- gredients (APIs). These challenges in- volve a multitude of issues designed to improve yield, purity, stereoselectivity, process conditions (i.e., temperature and pressure), scalability, and production eco- nomics. A recent literature review reveals insight into some of these challenges as they relate to organic chemical produc- tion overall and pharmaceutical chemical development in particular. O-arylation and O-alkylation Researchers at Merck & Co. recently reported on a large-scale synthesis of a potent glucokinase inhibitor, MK- 0941, through selective O-arylation and O-alkylation. Glucokinase in- hibitors are under clinical develop- ment for treating Type II diabetes. MK-0941 is a glucokinase inhibitor that has a differentially substituted 3,5-dihydroxybenzamide structure, and an efficient synthesis that would be suitable for large-scale prepara- tion was required. The researchers reported on several drawbacks of the early-stage synthesis, including mul- tiple recrystallizations to improve variability, and batch-to-batch variability in the impurity profile of the desired com- pound. Several factors were key to im- proving the synthesis: a highly selective mono- O-arylation of methyl 3,5-dihy- droxybenzoate with 2-ethanesulfonyl- 5-chloropyridine and the selection of a proper protective group for the SN2 O-alkylation (1).

One-pot protein synthesis Researchers at the University of Chi- cago recently developed a one-pot pro- tein covalent-dimer VEGF tein involved in vasculogenesis and an- giogenesis and is studied in reference to pharmaceutical compounds, partic- ularly anticancer compounds. The re- searchers reported that they prepared a 204-residue covalent dimmer VEGF with full mitogenic activity from three unprotected peptide segments by one- pot native chemical ligations. The co- valent structure of the synthetic VEGF was confirmed through mass mea- surements, and the three-dimensional structure of the synthetic protein was determined by high-resolution X-ray crystallography (2, 3). Chemical protein synthesis is one research area of University of Chi- cago professor Stephen B.H. Kent, a co-author of the recently published research on the VEGF synthesis. One area of focus is the preparation of long polypeptide chains of protein mol- ecules by the chemoselective reaction (i.e. chemical ligation) of unprotected protein segments containing mutu- ally reactive functional groups. An example of these ligation is amide-forming ligation or native ligation. The result- ing polypeptide chains are folded with good efficiency to produce high-purity synthetic proteins. The covalent struc- ture of the molecule is confirmed by mass spectrometry, and the three- dimensional fold structure of the syn- thetic protein is determined by X-ray crystallography. Another area of re- search focus is kinetically controlled ligation, a chemistry used for the full convergent synthesis of large protein molecules. The research group is ex- amining insertion reactions for creat- ing molecular diversity in preformed molecular scaffolds and the use of polymer-supported ligation.

The project used a multidisciplinary approach with the research on microreactor technology developed by a team led by Klaus F. Jensen, department head, Warren K. Lewis professor of chemical engineer- ing, and professor of materials science and engineering at MIT. The organic synthesis portion of the project was developed by a group led by Stephen Buchwald, Camille Dreyfus professor of chemistry at MIT (4, 5). Suzuki coupling is a palladium- catalyzed coupling between organo- boron compounds and organohalides and is an important reaction in or- ganic chemistry in general and in the development of pharmaceutical com- pounds specifically. Akira Suzuki, dis- tinguished professor emeritus at Hok- kaido University in Sapporo, Japan, was a corecipient of the 2010 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the development of palladium-catalyzed cross coupling (6). Although batch manufacturing is the predominant form of manu- facturing in the pharmaceutical in- dustry, there is growing interest in microreactor technology. In general, microstructured devices with small internal volumes and high surface- to-volume ratios offer transport ca- pabilities for rapid mixing, enhanced heat transfer for good temperature control, and intensified mass transfer. Microstructured devices operate in continuous-flow environment, which can offer certain advantages, such as controlled process conditions, high flow rates, and high mass throughput. Continuous operations also may allow bulk-chemistry processes to have high production capacities. Fluid dynamics determine the characteristics of con- tinuous-flow equipment such as pres- sure loss, residence time, heat-transfer characteristics, and mixing time (7). Buchwald is engaged in various re- search projects involving catalysis, in- cluding the creation and study of new ligands, the design of new methods to form carbon-nitrogen bonds through the use of metal catalysts, such as pal- ladium or copper, new methods for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds, including asymmetric transforma- tions, as well as continuous flow chem- istry using microreactors and capillary tubing. Buchwald recently reported on the continuous-flow synthesis of 3,3-disubstituted oxindoles by a palla- dium-catalyzed -arylation/alkylation Specifically, he reported on the pallidum-catalyzed -arylation of oxindoles in continuous flow involving a biphasic system, a precatalyst, and a packed-bed microreactor. The reaction was integrated into a two-step continu- ous-flow sequence for rapid, modular, and efficient syntheses of 3,3-disubsti- tuted oxindoles (8). Jensen's research is focused on un- derstanding and controlling the in- teraction of reaction and transport processes in realizing and testing func- tional microstructured and nanostruc- tured materials and devices for chemi- cal, biological, optical, electronic, and energy applications, including the use of microfabricated systems. He recently reported on research using an auto- mated microfluidic system for online optimization in chemical synthesis. He reported that the time and material re- quired for an optimization trial were minimized by performing reactions in an integrated silicon microreactor and incorporating high-performance liquid chromatography for in-line monitor- ing of the reaction performance. The system was used to optimize two dif- ferent reactions to understand the po- tential impact of the system for reac- tion development. The two reactions studied were a Knoevenagel conden- sation reaction and a mulitparameter optimization to maximize the yield of benzaldehyde in the oxidation pathway of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde to benzoic acid (9). In other work, Jensen's team reported on the design and use of a high-pressure and high-temperature microsystem. Key parameters for the fabrication of the microreactors and modular flu- idic packaging were to withstand high pressure and temperature conditions (i.e., 30MPa and 400 \u00baC). The research- ers reported on various applications of the high-pressure/high-temperature plug and play microsystems. These ap- plications included multiphase follow visualization through the transition of liquid-liquid immiscible hexane-water segmented flow to homogeneous super- critical flow, supercritical water oxidation, and synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles (10). Green-chemistry applications Green chemistry is an important tool in improving reactions, which may for ex- ample, improve production economics through reduced energy requirements, lower solvent use, fewer byproducts, and less waste generation. Bruce H. Lipshutz, professor in the chemistry and biochemistry department at the Univer- sity of California at Santa Barbara, was recognized in June with a Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award, an annual recognition by the US Environ- mental Protection Agency for advances in green chemistry (11). Nanodispersed surfactant . Lipshutz was recognized for designing a second- generation surfactant, TPGS-750-M, which can be used in industrial pro- cesses to replace large amounts of or- ganic solvents with small amounts of the surfactant nanodispersed in water only. TPGS-750-M is composed of tocopherol (i.e., vitamin E), succinic acid, and methoxy polyethylene gly- col. TPGS-750-M forms nanomicelles in water that are lipophilic on the in- terior and hydrophilic on the exterior. A small amount of TPGS-750-M may be used to spontaneously form 50-100- nm diameter micelles in water to serve as nanoreactors. The particle size of TPGS-750-M is engineered to facilitate organic reactions, such as cross-cou- plings. Reactants and catalysts dissolve in the micelles, resulting in high con- centrations that lead to increased reac- tion rates at ambient temperature (11).

These re- actions include ruthenium-catalyzed olefin silylations, and The technology also offers the potential for palladium-catalyzed aromatic car- bon-hydrogen bond activation for car- bon-carbon bond formation at room temperature. In its awards recognition, EPA cited other advantages to the tech- nology: straightforward product isola- tion; elimination of frothing and foam- ing commonly associated with other surfactants; efficient recycling of the surfactant after use; recovery of the insoluble product by extraction; and reuse of the aqueous surfactant with negligible loss of activity. Future gen- erations of surfactants may include a catalyst tethered to a surfactant to pro- vide both the reaction vessel (i.e., the inside of the micelle) and the catalyst to enable the reaction (11). Flow processing . Eli Lilly submitted two entries to EPA's Green Chemistry Presidential Challenge. The first in- volved the commercial production of LY2624803*H3PO4, an investigational new drug candidate in Phase II clini- cal trials and a drug acquired by Lilly with its acquisition of Hypnion. The original synthesis was not amenable to large-scale manufacture and had several environmental and safety issues with the original chemistry. Among them were: dimethylformamide/so- dium hydride in step one of the syn- thesis; methylene in various steps; a molten step with observed self-heating; an aldehyde purification that would be unsafe at increased scale; phosphoryl chloride in large excess; and chromato- graphic purification (11). The company made several im- provements to the synthesis using flow processing. An efficient carbonylation replaced an inefficient oxidation cata- lyzed by tetramethyl Hydrogen replaced sodium triacetoxyborohydride in a reductive amination. Although both operations required high pressure (i.e., 1000 psi), which would be difficult to manage in a batch environment, both operations were amenable to flow processing (11). Process mass intensity (PMI), a mea- sure of the efficiency of a synthesis, was improved. PMI is the total mass of raw materials (including water) put into a process for every kilogram of product produced. The original route had a PMI of more than 1000 before chroma- tography. The new route has a net PMI of 59, representing a 94% reduction in PMI and a 96% percent reduction with chromatography. Lilly implemented its new route for LY2624803*H3PO4 on a pilot-plant scale in Indianapolis, Indi- ana, during 2009 and on a commercial scale in Kinsale, Ireland, during 2010, according to the EPA report (11). Improved Grignard chemistry. An- other entry from Eli Lilly involved the development of Grignard chem- istry using a continuous stirred tank reactor. The Grignard reaction is ap- plied to many industrial reactions, including producing intermediates for pharmaceutical compounds. Some commercial-scale problems with the reaction, however, are strongly exo- thermic activation and reaction steps, heterogeneous reactions with potential problems suspending and mixing the reaction mixture, and operational haz- ards posed by ethereal solvents, such as diethyl ether (11). Eli Lilly developed inherently safer Grignard chemistry using a continu- ous stirred tank reactor that allowed continuous formation of Grignard re- agents with continuous coupling and quenching. This approach minimized hazards by operating at a small reac- tion volume, performed metal activa- tion only once during each campaign, and used 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MeTHF). MeTHF offers certain ad- vantages, such as that it may be de- rived from renewable resources and may provide improved chemoselec- tivity and stereoselectivity compared with Grignard products using other ethereal solvents. The continuous ap- proach provided reductions of 43% in metal use, 10% in Grignard reagent stoichiometry, and 30% in PMI (11) According to the EPA report, Lilly is using the continuous stirred tank reac- tor Grignard approach to produce two key materials: the penultimate inter- mediate of LY2216684*HCl, a norepi- nephrine reuptake inhibitor currently under clinical investigation, and for an intermediate for another drug under clinical development. Commercial production on a 22-L scale is under consideration (11). References 1. N. Yoshikawa et al., Org. Process. Res. Dev. 15 (4), 824-830 (2011). 2. K. Mandal and S.B.H.

Submitted: Feb. 11, 2011. Accepted: Apr. 27, 2011.Freeze-Drying Modern drug-discovery techniques are rapidly increasing the number of lipophilic drugs (1). This lipophilicity and consequent slow dissolution rate results in poor bioavailability after oral administration. However, these drugs are easily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract once dissolved (2). Therefore, the bioavailabilities of these drugs can be improved by increasing dissolution rate (3). The formation of drug nanocrystals is one of many strate- gies to increase dissolution rate. Drug nanocrystals are crys- talline drug particles with a diameter below 1 m. Because of their small size, the saturation concentration around these particles is increased (Ostwald-Freundlich, see Eq. 1), the boundary layer thickness is decreased (Prandtl, see Eq. 2), and the specific surface area is increased (4). All these effects contribute to an increased dissolution rate (Noyes- Whitney, see Eq. 3) as shown below (5). (Eq. 1) where, Cs,curved is the saturation concentration around the curved surface, Cs,flat is the saturation concentration at a flat surface, s is the interfacial surface tension, Md is the molecular weight of the drug, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, d is the density of the drug, and r is the radius of curvature of the drug. (Eq. 2) where, h is the hydrodynamic boundary layer thickness, k is a constant, L is the length of the surface in the direction of the flow, and V is the relative velocity of the flowing liquid versus the flat surface.Controlled Crystallization During Freeze-Drying A Process Suitable for Large-Scale Nanocrystals Hans de Waard, Niels Grasmeijer, (Eq. 3) where, dm/dt is the dissolution rate of the drug, d is the diffusion constant, A is the specific surface area, and C is the concentration in the bulk. Current methods to prepare drug nanocrystals can be divided into bottom-up and top-down methods. Top-down methods (e.g., ball milling and high pressure homogenization) have disadvantages, such as the use of surfactants, low process yields, and the difficulty in achieving uniform- size distribution (6, 7). Bottom-up methods are generally precipitation-based but also have disadvantages, such as difficulty in controlling crystal size and the need to use toxic organic solvents. To overcome these disadvantages, controlled crystallization during freeze-drying (CCDF) was developed as a novel method to prepare drug nanocrystals (8). First, two solutions are prepared: lipophilic drug in tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA), and matrix material in water. The two solutions are mixed and immediately frozen. The temperature in the freeze-dryer is then increased to 25 /uni2218C and this temperature is kept constant for a few hours. Finally, the frozen mixture is freeze dried at this relatively high temperature. Because the mixture of drug, matrix material, TBA, and water is thermodynamically unstable, the drug and matrix material can either crystallize upon freezing or after the temperature in the freeze-dryer is increased (9). Therefore, the first aim of the study was to elucidate when the four different components crystallized during the production process by placing a Raman probe in the freeze-dryer above the sample. By using this in-line analytical tool, the crystallization of the individual components was monitored. The second aim of the study was to modify the freeze- drying process to ensure its suitability for large-scale production. Because the thermodynamically unstable mixture must be frozen immediately after mixing, at laboratory- scale, only small quantities were mixed in glass vials and subsequently frozen on a freeze-dryer shelf or by immersion in liquid nitrogen. At production scale, it is difficult to mix and freeze large quantities sufficiently fast, so a three-way nozzle was evaluated for its ability to solve this technical problem. The three-way nozzle used in this study allows two liquids to flow separately through the nozzle; the two solutions are mixed just outside the nozzle by an atomizing airflow from a third channel and sprayed into liquid nitrogen, thus achieving high freezing rates. To investigate whether this three-way nozzle could modify the small batch freeze-drying process into a semicontinuous spray freeze-drying process, the crystallinity, particle size, and dissolution rate of the obtained products were determined. Materials and methods Raw materials. Fenofibrate and TBA were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie, mannitol (the matrix material) was obtained from Roquette and VWR International. Preparation of the controlled crystallized dispersions by freeze- drying. To prepare the controlled crystallized dispersions, fenofibrate was dissolved in TBA and mannitol (the matrix material) was dissolved in water (see Table I for compositions). For the small batch freeze-drying process, the aqueous solution and the TBA solution were mixed in a 6:4 ratio. The mixture was frozen in vials on a precooled ( 50 /uni2218C) freeze-dryer shelf (Christ) or by immersion in liquid nitrogen after being placed on the precooled freeze-dryer shelf. The temperature of the samples was equilibrated at 50 /uni2218C on the freeze-dryer shelf. The temperature of the freeze-dryer shelf was then increased to 25 /uni2218C. This temperature was kept constant for at least three hours, after which time the samples were dried at the same temperature by decreasing pressure and using a condenser temperature of 85 /uni2218C. Preparation of the controlled crystallized dispersions by spray freeze-drying. For the semicontinuous spray freeze-drying process, the aqueous solution and the TBA solution were pumped separately (9 and 6 mL/min, respectively) through the three-way nozzle and sprayed into liquid nitrogen. After the nitrogen was evaporated, the frozen sample was placed on the freeze-dryer shelf and equilibrated at 50 \u00baC. The temperature was gradually increased to 25 /uni2218C and kept constant for three hours. After this, the samples were dried at the same temperature by decreasing the pressure and using a condenser temperature of 85 /uni2218C. In-line Raman spectroscopy. A noncontact probe (Kaiser Optical Systems) was placed immediately above the sample in the freeze-dryer and coupled via a glass fiber optic cable to a Raman Rxn1 spectrometer (Kaiser Optical Systems) equipped with an air-cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) detector (back-illuminated deep depletion design).

All spectra were recorded at a resolution of 4 cm1 using a laser power of 400 mW. The HoloREACT reaction analysis (Kaiser Optical Systems) and profiling software package, the Matlab Software package (version 6.5, MathWorks), and the Grams/AIPLSplusIQ software package (version 7.02, Thermo Scientific) were used for data collection, transfer, and analysis. Spectra were preprocessed by baseline correction using Pearson's method. Spectra were collected every minute during freeze-drying, and the exposure time was 30 s. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM pictures were taken with a JEOL JSM 6301-F microscope (JEOL) using an acceleration voltage of 5 kV. The samples were dispersed on top of double-sided sticky carbon tape on metal disks and coated with a thin layer of gold-palladium in a Balzers 120B sputtering device (Balzers Union). Tableting. Tablets of 100 mg were prepared on an ESH compaction apparatus (Hydro Mooi) at a compaction rate of 5 kN/s to a maximum compaction load of 5 kN. The tablets were stored for at least one day in a vacuum desiccator over silica gel before further processing. Dissolution. The dissolution rate of fenofibrate from the tablets was tested in 1 L of 0.5% w/v sodium dodecyl sulfate solution (Fagron) at 37 /uni2218 C in a USP dissolution apparatus II (Rowa Techniek) with a paddle speed of 100 rpm. The concentration of fenofibrate was determined spectrophotometrically by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (UV-1601, Shimadzu) at a 290 nm. Results and discussion In-line Raman spectroscopy. The dissolution rate of the solid dispersion, which had been frozen on a precooled freeze- dryer shelf, was higher than the dissolution rate of the physical mixture (see Figure 1). Because the freeze-dried sample was fully crystalline (as determined by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray powder diffraction, the difference in dissolution rate was likely caused by differences in drug crystal size. Therefore, the drug crystals in the controlled crystallized dispersion were smaller (probably in the nanosize range), than the drug crystals in the physical mixture (x50 = 13 /uni03BC m, determined by laser diffraction). Although both components in the solid dispersion were fully crystalline, it was not clear at what point during the process the drug and matrix material crystallized. Therefore, in-line Raman spectroscopy was used to measure crystallization during the freeze-drying procedure. The Raman spectra clearly show peaks corresponding These peaks are clearly separated from each other (see Figure 2), so the crystallization of the individual components could be monitored throughout the process.

The gray bars indicate the characteristic peaks of water (208-226 cm-1), coUrTeSy oF The AUThorS Pharmaceutical Technology August 2011 61crystallization, the relative intensities of the individual peaks of fenofibrate, mannitol, and water were determined. An increase in the peak intensity indicates the formation of crystals of the corresponding component. Peak intensity cannot be used to determine crystallization of TBA because liquid TBA already shows a peak with a high intensity. Therefore, the width of this peak was used to determine the onset and end of crystallization (10). A narrowing of the peak indicates the start of the TBA crystallization. After 15 min on a precooled freeze-dryer shelf, only the TBA peak can be seen in the Raman spectrum (see Figure 2). This indicates that at this stage of the process, the solvents were still in the liquid state and that the solutes were still dissolved in these solvents. After 75 min, the intensity of the peak corresponding to ice increased, and the width of the TBA peak decreased. However, no significant change in the relative intensities of either fenofibrate or mannitol peaks could be seen, which shows that during the freezing step, the solvents crystallized and that, importantly, the solutes did not. During equilibration at 50 C the solutes still did not crystallize. However, when the temperature was increased to 25 C and maintained for 500 min, mannitol and fenofibrate peaks increased. This increase in intensity finished well before the drying step was initiated, indicating that crystalline mannitol and crystalline fenofibrate were formed during the crystallization step and that this crystallization was finished before drying started. To initiate drying, the pressure was decreased at 2963 min. The intensity of the water peak decreased and the width of the TBA peak increased thus indicating that sublimation of the solvents had begun. In summary, upon freezing, only the solvents crystallized, while the solutes did not crystallize until the temperature in the freeze-dryer was increased. Crystallization of the solutes finished before drying started. From freeze-drying to spray freeze-drying using a three-way nozzle. Because only small quantities can be prepared in vials in the initial experiment, this freeze-drying process is not suitable for large-scale production. Therefore, a three- way nozzle was tested to determine if it could convert the small-batch freeze-drying process into a semicontinuous spray freeze-drying process for scale-up. Solid dispersions prepared by freeze-drying (freezing in liquid nitrogen) and spray freeze-drying were compared. The dissolution rate of fenofibrate from dispersions prepared by the semicontinuous spray freeze-drying process was faster, especially at a higher drug load, than that of dispersions prepared by the small-batch freeze-drying process (see Figure 3). Because dispersions obtained from the different processes were all fully crystalline, the differences in dissolution rate should be attributed to differences in drug crystal size. Indeed, the SEM pictures indicate that crystals obtained Figure 3: Dissolution profiles of fenofibrate from tablets composed of physical mixtures (open symbols), dispersions prepared by the batch process (black symbols), and dispersions prepared by the semicontinuous process (gray symbols). The tablets contained 30% (circular symbols) and 40% (square symbols) w/w fenofibrate in mannitol.

However, in-line Raman spectroscopy measurements showed that the solutes did not crystallize upon freezing, but after the temperature of the freeze-dryer shelf was increased. Therefore, the difference in drug crystal size can be explained by the difference in freezing rate (11). During the batch process, vials containing 2 mL solution were immersed in liquid nitrogen, whereas during the semi- continuous process very small droplets were sprayed into liquid nitrogen. Because the volumes of the individual droplets were smaller than the volume of liquid in the vial, rapid freezing rates could be achieved by spray-freezing into liquid nitrogen (12). A higher freezing rate leads to the formation of smaller solvent crystals, and therefore smaller interstitial spaces (containing the freeze-concentrated fraction) between the solvent crystals (13). Because the drug and matrix crystallize in the freeze-concentrated fraction, the size of the drug crystals is limited to the size of these interstitial spaces. Thus, when smaller interstitial spaces are formed, the final drug crystal size is smaller (see Figure 5). Conclusion By using in-line Raman spectroscopy, it was shown that during the freezing step of the CCDF process only the solvents crystallized. The solutes did not crystallize until the temperature in the freeze-dryer was increased. Furthermore, the three-way nozzle can be used to alter the small-batch process into a semicontinuous process that is suitable for large-scale production. Controlled crystallized dispersions prepared by the semicontinuous process results in even smaller nanocrystals due to a higher freezing rate. Therefore, the semicontinuous process is not only suitable for large-scale production, but can also result in a better product. References 1. C.A. Lipinski et al., Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. (2001). 2.

During this two-phase process that includes spraying and drying, the addition of a binder liquid causes pri- mary particles to aggregate and form granules (1). The granule size distribution (GSD) is of major importance to the final quality of the granulated product because it influences density, flowability, and dustiness. Hence, the understanding and control of granule growth during manufacturing are of major importance to the de- livery of a high-quality end product. Sieve analysis, image analysis, and laser diffraction are common off-line particle-size determination techniques. These methods are usually time-consuming and labor-in- tensive because they require sample preparation. In recent years, interest in real-time process analysis has increased, partly because of FDA's process analytical technology (PAT) initiative. Several studies have examined at-line, on-line, and in-line particle-size analysers. information continuously. During SFV measurements, particles pass through a laser beam, and the corresponding shadow thrown onto the detec- tor helps determine the chord-length distribution of the measured particles. The measurement zone at the probe tip is equipped with sapphire windows that are kept clean by an internal compressed- air supply system, thus preventing window fouling. A two-level full-factorial design was used to examine the influence of process and formulation variables on end product GSD, measured in-line with SFV and compared with off-line laser (LD) re- sults. The granule-size data obtained continuously in-line were analyzed in detail to improve understanding of the influence of the examined process and formulation variables on the granule growth mechanism. Furthermore, the in-line quantified GSD was related to the off-line-measured tapped density using univariate, Understanding Fluidized-Bed Granulation Using In-Line Measurements Kerkhof, M. Hellings, J.P. Remon, C. Vervaet, and T.

Materials and methods Materials. The dry powder mass consisted of dextrose monohydrate (700 g, Roquette Fr\u00e8res) and unmodified maize starch (Cargill Benelux). This was granulated with an aqueous binder solution of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC, type 2910, 15 mPa, Dow Chemical) and Tween 20 (Croda Chemicals Europe). The amounts of HPMC and Tween 20 were varied according to the design of experiments (DOE, see Table I). The HPMC binder was always sprayed as a 4% solution, and the total amount of solids was kept constant at 1 kg by varying the amount of maize starch accordingly. Fluid-bed granulation set-up. Granulations in the fluid-bed granulator at a height of 200 mm above the distributor plate and at approximately 50 mm from the side wall of the granulator. Granules passed through a 4-mm aperture, and an internal and external air con- nection prevented fouling of the measurement zone and ensured the dispersion of the powder mass. SFV data were collected every second during the entire granulation processes, but an average granule-size distribution was saved every 10 s. The granulation process finished when an outlet air temperature of 37 C and a product temperature of 45 C were reached. DOE. A two-level full-factorial design was applied to study the effects of HPMC concentration, Tween 20 concentration, inlet-air temperature during spraying, and inlet-air temperature during drying (see Table I) on the end-product's GSD. Three design center point repetitions were performed (i.e., 19 experiments in total). Off-line granule characterization. For each DOE granulation experiment, the end- product particle-size distribution was determined with LD (Mastersizer S long bench, Malvern Instruments). Average D10, D50, and D90 values were deter- mined based on measurements of each batch. End-product tapped-density measure- ments (1250 taps, J. Englesmann) were per- formed in triplicate, and the average tapped density was used. Results and discussion Comparison of in-line SFV and off-line LD particle-size measurements. The GSD of the end products measured in-line using SFV was com- pared with the off-line determined LD granule sizes for all DOE batches. Although SFV and LD are based on different measure- ment principles (LD assumes spherical particles, whereas SFV does not), similar GSDs were expected. Figure 1 displays the average D50 values measured with SFV (i.e., the average of the last granu- lation minute, or six data points) and LD for the end granules of all 19 DOE batches. Similar D50 differences between the 19 ex- periments were obtained by the two particle-sizing techniques. However, D50 sizes measured with LD were always lower than those obtained by SFV. The same observations were made for the D10 and D90 values. The authors believe that this difference in GSD is caused by the LD measurement technique. The quantified particles experience rapid accelerations as the air stream passes through a venturi. The high shear applied during this process and the subsequent colli- sions with the wall of the apparatus may cause granules to break or crumble. Pressurized air also disperses the granules during the SFV measurements, but the particles pass directly through the measurement zone. No collisions occur because high shear is not applied. The authors' hypothesis was confirmed by the GSD mea- surement of low-friability spherical granules (i.e., Cellets 100, and 350, Pharmatrans Sanaq Pharmaceuticals) using SFV and LD under software and experimental settings identical to those for the DOE granules. The LD measurements did not systematically un- derestimate the GSD, in contrast to observations obtained for the breakable granules. An additional explanation for the discrepancy between SFV and LD values might be found in the assumption of a spherical shape during LD measurements. Size segregation during fluidization should also be addressed because it influences in-line SFV measurements (23). Inappropri- ate fluidization can cause a high amount of larger granules to be present in the lower part of the chamber and a high amount of smaller granules to appear in the upper part of the chamber. The SFV probe is placed in the upper part of the chamber, which the largest particles cannot reach under low inlet airflow rates, poten- tially resulting in an underestimation of granule size.

Because these differences did not increase as a function of increasing end granule size, the authors concluded that no size segrega- tion had occurred. These primary results suggest that al- though a systematic difference exists be- tween LD and SFV data, the SFV technique can successfully measure the actual parti- cle-size distribution during granulation. Improved process understanding through continuously gathered GSD information. The average D50 values, obtained from the in-line SFV measurements during the last minute of granulation, were used as DOE responses. The experimental results revealed three significant DOE variables. HPMC concentration, inlet air tempera- ture during drying, and the interaction between these factors had a positive effect on the D50 values. Because GSD informa- tion was obtained every 10 s through in- line SFV measurements, the authors took a closer look at the individual granule-size profiles of several DOE batches to better understand the significance of the studied DOE factors. Influence of the HPMC concentration. The dis- tinctive particle-size trajectory during fluid-bed granulation consisting of three phases can be distinguished clearly in Fig- ure 3. Between the first captured granule- size data and time point 1, the particle size remains constant, which corresponds to the mixing phase. Between time points 1 and 2, the granule size increases because of the agglomeration of powder particles. The drying period is depicted after time point 2. The graph reveals that the positive effect of the HPMC concentration on granule size was caused by the following two factors: Large amounts of HPMC resulted in large particles throughout the spray- ing period. At time point 2 (see Fig- ure 3), Batch 13 (1% HPMC) had an average granule size of 200 /uni03BCm, Batch 14 (3% HPMC) displayed an av- erage granule size of 415 /uni03BCm. Large amounts of HPMC created less friable granules, which resulted in less fines during the drying period. Be- tween time points 2 and 3 (see Figure 3), Batch 13 (1% HPMC) showed ap-Figure 2a: Differences between average spatial-filter velocimetry (SFV) and laser diffraction (LD), arranged according to increasing SFV particle size.

Influence of the inlet air temperature during the drying period. DOE analy- sis showed that the drying inlet air temperature was of less im- portance (statistical significance p < 0.05) to the GSD than the HPMC concentration (statistical significance p < 0.001). An ex- planation can be found in Figure 4. Figure 4a displays the in-line measured D50 profiles of Batches 6 (50 C drying temperature) and 14 (70 C drying temperature). The other settings were the same for both batches. These batches showed a similar granule- size trajectory throughout the spraying phase. During the subse- quent drying period, Batch 6 yielded smaller end-sized granules because of higher levels of attrition during a longer drying phase. Figure 4b displays the granule-size data of two other batches with different drying conditions. Batch 1 was dried at 50 C, and Batch 9 at 70 C. Both batches had identical initial process condi-tions, but a different granule growth profile occurred during the spraying period. Al- though the difference in drying tempera- ture between the two batches caused a clear difference in particle-size evolution during the drying period (i.e., a larger decrease in particle size at the lower temperature of Batch 1), the end granule sizes used for the DOE analysis were similar. Hence, for these batches, a similar response value was used in the DOE analysis, despite the fact that the batches showed different granula- tion trajectories. This result might explain why the drying temperature was of limited significance according to the DOE. Only through the information obtained con- tinuously in-line from the SFV probe was it possible to develop this in-depth under- standing. Influence of the inlet air temperature during the spraying period. Figure 5 shows the D50 data obtained in-line during the spraying pe- riod of two batches manufactured at dif- ferent spraying temperatures. During the agglomeration phase of Batch 5 (spraying temperature of 50 C), a higher fluctua- tion in granule size was observed, com- pared with Batch 1 (spraying temperature of 40 C). This result was caused by the continuous entrapment of small particles in and subsequent discharge from the filter bags. At the higher temperature, small particles were present for a longer period of time than they were in Batch 1 because the faster evaporation of binder liquid led to slower agglomeration. How- ever, at the end of the spraying periods, a similar particle size was observed at both temperatures. Although the detailed profile of granule growth through in-line granule-size monitoring showed a difference in agglomeration kinetics, the different spraying temperature did not create a difference in granule size at the end of the spraying period. Estimation of granule tapped density from in-line SFV measurements. The tapped density of the end product is, like GSD, also impor- tant to further processing. Univariate, multivariate, and multi- way approaches were considered to relate the in-line determined GSD to the tapped density of the 19 DOE batches (tapped den- sity as dependent variable: 19 \u00d7 1 Y-vector). A univariate linear model was built using the D50 SFV values of the end granules of the 19 DOE batches as independent variables (19 \u00d7 1 X-vector). A multivariate partial least squares (PLS) of the end granules of the 19 DOE experiments as independent variables (19 \u00d7 8 X-matrix). A multiway N-way PLS ( N-PLS) Figure and 14 (3% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose [HPMC], 0.2% Tween 20, 50 C spraying T, 50 C, and 70 C drying T) and (b) batches 1 and 9 (1% HPMC, 0.2% Tween 20, 40 C spraying T, 50 C, and 70 C drying T). Pharmaceutical Technology August 2011 67model was built using of the 19 DOE experiments in a function of complete batch process time as inde- pendent variables (three-way X -matrix). Table II compares the goodness of fit (R2) and root mean square error of estima- tion (RMSEE) of the different models. The multivariate PLS tapped-density model had the highest R2 value and the lowest RMSEE value. The low RMSEE of the model sug- gests the ability of the in-line SFV data to predict the off-line measured tapped den- sity. Nevertheless, the model performance should be tested independently because the RMSEE value relates to the error within the calibration set and may overestimate the actual model performance. Conclusion The results of this study show the feasibil- ity of SFV for the real-time monitoring of GSD during fluid-bed granulation. The technique was sensitive to PS changes during the performed granulations and did not underestimate the granule size be- cause of size segregation. Probe fouling did not occur. The continuously obtained GS information enabled a better understand- ing of the significance of the studied DOE factors on granulation. This understanding was not possible based on the off-line LD data of the end product. Finally, a multivari- ate PLS model was built to estimate end-product tapped density using continuously obtained GSD during granulation, which may improve batch-release time. Next to real-time process monitoring of critical quality attri- butes, which helps to improve process understanding, another goal of PAT is to use the real-time critical information to steer or adjust the process toward its desired state based on feedback and feed- forward loops. Granule particle-size distribution and density are important granule quality attributes. In a future study, the authors aim to use in-line collected granule information gathered during the spraying phase to adjust process variables from the consecu- tive drying phase, hence guiding the drying process to the desired granule properties.

The current study applied this technique to the release of antibiotics and a protein. The approach substantially reduced the initial burst release and provided zero-order release kinetics. The method can be applied to any type of porous drug carrier because the techniques for depositing a polymer overlayer are independent of the substrate.

Submitted: Feb. 17, 2011. Accepted: May 13, 2011Controlled Release Advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology have led to the development of novel drug-delivery plat- forms. During the past decade, attention has fo- cused on nanoporous materials of which the pore size, pore distribution, geometry, and surface functionality can be controlled at the micro- and nanoscale (1-4). For example, porous alumina and porous titanium architectures obtained electrochemically have been proposed for implant- able medical devices such as bone implants, vascular stents, and immunoisolation capsules (5-11). The interest in porous materials for therapeutic implants arises not only because of their ability to support tissue integration, but also because they can carry drugs (4, 6). The pores of these materials can be loaded with therapeutic agents and thus act as reservoirs for slow drug elution over extended periods of time, ranging from several days to several weeks (4, 6, 7). The advantages of local therapy through extended release time are high therapeutic concentrations at the target site and minimal systemic exposure (4, 7). Porous aluminum has been used extensively as a scaffold for bone-tissue engineering applications. The biocompat- ibility of porous aluminum has been established, and the material has current clinical applications in orthopedic and dental implants (12). Also biocompatible, titanium and its alloys, particularly Ti-6Al-4V, have been used in orthopedic and dental implants extensively since the 1970s (13). It is estimated that more than 500,000 total joint replacements, primarily of hips and knees, and 100,000-300,000 dental implants are provided each year in the United States (13). About 25% of hip-replacement surgeries were undertaken to correct the failure of a previous implant. If an implant is improperly installed, loosening and osteolysis can occur. To overcome this problem, implant bone material should stimulate rapid bone regeneration to fill deficient bones and affix the implant firmly to the bone. The aim of the current research was to engineer bone implants that control and guide rapid healing (12, 13). In 1994, two large trials demonstrated the superiority of coronary stents over conventional angioplasty in the treat- ment of coronary artery disease by showing 30% reductions of restenosis rates (14). However, such interventions are asso- ciated with major complications. For example, the prolifera-Controlled Release Porous Platforms Spomenka Simovic, Dusan VasilevPharmaceutical smooth muscle cells (VSMC)can narrow the prosthesis, and endothelial-cell (EC) injury and dysfunction can result in thrombosis. A stent surface that incorporates titanium nanotubes can promote re-endothelialisation and decrease VSMC proliferation (8). Titanium nanotubes im- prove the proliferation and function of endothelial cells, decrease the proliferation of VSMCs, and enhance the pro- duction of prostaglandin I2, which mitigates thrombosis and restenosis (8). To understand how endothelial cells interact with TiO 2 nanostructured surfaces (i.e., how nanotopography affects the morphology of ECs), scientists grew bovine aortic en- dothelial cells on nanotubular and flat surfaces (8). Cells on nanotubular substrates had elongated morphologies, but cells on the flat surfaces were spread out and covered greater surface areas. Because of the elongation, cells on nanotubes covered 60% of the average area occupied by the control cells. The elongated cells also had increased prolif- eration and extracellular matrix production when compared with their spread-out counterparts. In addition, elongated cells had higher migration speeds. Since migration into the wound site is a major mode of re-endothelialization, en- hanced EC motility may greatly improve healing after injury or device implantation (8). The encapsulation of living cells (i.e., cellular immunoiso- lation using semipermeable porous aluminum barriers) has also been investigated in the past several decades as a poten- tial treatment for diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and Type I diabetes (11). The encapsulation of living cells is a promising future therapy because immunoprotected cells, such as pancreatic islets or hepatocytes, can respond physio- logically both in vitro and in vivo to appropriate stimuli (11). Scientists have adopted two general strategies to control drug release rate from porous materials. The first strategy relies on the adjustment of pore diameter and pore depth to control drug loading and release (4). The second uses surface functionalization of the pores, which affects drug affinity, and consequently release kinetics (4). However, these strat- egies have drawbacks. For example, in both strategies, the release kinetics are marked with an initial burst that may not be desirable in some applications. In addition, reducing the pore diameter to extend the length of drug release leads to a reduced pore volume and, consequently, less drug can be stored (6, 7). This article introduces a novel strategy for controlling the release of therapeutics from porous materials and demonstrates its applicability using model antibiotics and a protein. Experimental protocols High-purity aluminum foil (99.99 wt %, Alfa Aesar) with a thickness of 100 /uni03BCm was used to fabricate anodic alu- minim oxide (AAO) substrates, according to the published method (15). Aluminum foil was degreased in acetone, sonicated for 30 min, thoroughly rinsed with MilliQ water, and electrochemically anodized using two-step anodiza-tion following previously reported procedures (16, 17). The first anodization was performed for 2-4 h under a 60-80 V and an electrolyte temperature of 1 /uni2218C in 0.3 M oxalic acid. After the resulting aluminum layer was dissolved, the second anodization was performed as described previously. The anodization conditions were maintained to ensure that all porous layers had the same pore diameters (70-90 nm) and pore thickness (20 \u00b5m). The drugs were loaded through consecutive deposition (20 times) followed by drying under vacuum for 2 h. Release testing was carried out in 5 mL of phosphate buffer (PB) at 37 /uni2218C. For each point in drug-release determination, 0.5 mL of medium was removed, diluted by 2.5 mL PB, and spec- trophotometrically analyzed for drug content. Withdrawn medium was immediately replaced with 0.5 mL of fresh PB. Plasma polymerization was carried out in a custom-built reactor described elsewhere using a commercial 13.56-MHz plasma generator (Advanced Energy, 16, 17). The deposi- tions were carried out in an atmosphere of pure allylamine (AA) at a pressure of 0.22 Torr. An input power setting of 20 W was used in combination with a matching network to minimize reflected power. The deposition of AA under these conditions was carried out for 50, 200, and 300 s. The deposition rate was about 0.5 nm/s1, determined by ellipsometry on polished silicon wafers. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on a Philips XL 30 FEGSEM. Results and discussion Controlling drug release from porous materials. To overcome the drawbacks of current approaches, a strategy for controlling drug release rate from porous materials was developed. The aim was to enable zero-order release kinetics with mini- mal burst release and without compromising the amount of loaded drug, which is important in long-term thera- pies (18). At the heart of this strategy is the deposition of a plasma-polymer layer with controlled thickness on top of the porous substratum loaded with a drug. The hypoth- esis was that the plasma-polymer layer would reduce the pore diameters at the surface, which, in turn, would define the rate of drug release form the pores. Plasma polymers are formed on a substrate from a gas phase when a selected precursor is electrically excited (19). Using plasma polymers for the present drug-delivery platform design has several advantages. Firstly, solvents are not involved because plasma polymers are deposited in the gas phase. Solvents may lead to loss or contamination of the loaded drug. Secondly, the thickness of the plasma polymer overlayer can be controlled with nanometer precision by the plasma-deposition condi- tions (in this particular study, by deposition time), which is important to establish precise control over release rate. Finally, in this study, plasma polymer films were deposited from vapor of allylamine, which resulted in films rich in amine functional groups. These types of films promote the adhesion and function of biological cells (20, 21).70 Pharmaceutical Technology August 2011 PharmTech.comThe authors chose AAO as a model porous platform because it can be prepared by a self-ordering anodization process using simple preparation procedures (15, 16, 20-21). It consists of an array of perpendicular and highly ordered pores with a diameter of 80 nm and a depth of 20 /uni03BCm. To demonstrate control of drug release rate through this ap- proach, the authors selected common antibiotics and a protein as model compounds of various molecular weights. These items include levofloxacin (MW last step, an allylamine plasma-polymer film of pre- determined thickness was deposited on top of the porous material loaded with drug. The thickness of the deposited film was controlled by the time of deposition, which was 50, 120, 200, and 300 s. SEM characterization of the porous substrata after plasma-polymer deposition for 0, 50, 200, and 300 s is shown in Figure 1. After plasma deposition, pore diameters decreased from 80-90 nm to < 20 nm. The thickness of plasma-polymer films deposited from the same precursor on plain silicon wafers were measured by ellipsometry as 41 nm, 89 nm, 134 nm, and 200 nm when films were deposited for 50, 120, 200, and 300 s, respectively. However, the thick- ness measured on plain surfaces can only be used as a guide. Previous reports demonstrated that plasma polymers de- posit differently on porous materials (20). Films grow from the rims of the pores and reduce the diameter of the pores at the surface. Importantly, the plasma polymers do not fill the pores, but only deposit at the pore entrance (16). Drug-release kinetics: proof of concept. The drug-release pro- files from AAO for samples with and without plasma-poly- mer film deposited on the surface are presented in Figures 2-4. Increasing the time of deposition (i.e., film thickness) clearly led to slower release for all three model drugs. Release behavior is also a function of drug type. Extended release of levofloxacin (see Figure 2) of three weeks can only be achieved if the plasma deposition time is prolonged to 500 s. In the case of vancomycin (see Figure 3), which has a mo- lecular weight more than three times larger than that of levofloxacin, extended release can be achieved after plasma deposition of only 50 s. A clear correlation between time of deposition and drug release profiles was observed. From un- coated samples, drug is completely released within 45 min. Depositing plasma polymer for 50 s extends the release to about 200 h. Deposition for 200 s further extends the release because only 50% of drug is released after 500 h. Figure 4 shows the release of BSA. As in the case of antibiotics, in- creasing the time of deposition led to a slower release rate; release could be extended to six weeks when plasma polymer was deposited for 200 s. The release kinetics from plasma-coated platforms can be described in two phases. The initial fast release within the first 45-60 min (see Figures 2-4) can be regarded as a burst, whereas release patterns from 1 h to completed release can be considered controlled release and fit into first- and zero- order models (see Table I, 20-21). The parameters show that zero-order kinetics best account for the experimental data. Furthermore, zero-order release (i.e., constant k 0) follows the same rank order as plasma-polymer deposition time. With increasing deposition time, the zero-order release constant decreases exponentially (see Table I). Zero-order release kinetics are a desirable release pattern because a constant amount of drug is released in each time interval (13). Such release kinetics, typical for reservoir transdermal delivery systems, are rarely reported for porous devices (15). The ability to control the release rate of various drugs, including proteins, makes the authors' system a potential platform for the design of various therapeutic implants and drug-delivery devices. The results demonstrate that it is pos- sible to achieve zero-order release kinetics from porous ma- terials through controlled deposition of a plasma-polymer layer. The method for controlled drug release by deposition of a plasma polymer overlayer also could be extended to any type of porous drug carrier because the deposition tech- niques are independent of the substrate. Conclusion The authors described a method for controlled release of therapeutics from porous materials that has the potential to be applied to various therapeutics and types of porous Cntrlneeda Rdeds/s.scd Figure 1: Scanning electron microscope images of the anodic aluminim oxide (AAO) bare surface and (a) AAO modified with allylamine plasma polymer using deposition times of (b) 50 s, (c) 200 s, and (d) 300 s.

The method involves the application of a plasma- polymer layer on top of porous materials, and the thickness of this layer controls release kinetics. Athough the current study emphasizes plasma polymerization as a tool to reduce pore diameter at the surface, future work should consider the influence of the plasma polymer's physical proper- ties, such as hydrophilicity, on drug release. The ability of plasma polymerization to provide films of various physical and chemical properties provides enormous flexibility for fine tuning drug-release platforms to suit various drugs and applications.

Dur- ing these service lifetimes, manufacturing equipment will likely require both preventive and corrective maintenance activities that may involve the replacement of parts within the systems. Parts replacements must be performed under the appropriate change controls to ensure that manufactur- ing equipment remains in a validated state with respect to installation, operation, and performance. Change-control considerations are greatly facilitated when replacement parts are exactly identical to the original parts. However, it is not uncommon for pharmaceutical manufacturers to resort to procuring and installing replacement parts that are not identical to the original parts due to changes affected by parts suppliers (e.g., product redesigns, discontinuations). In these instances, a risk-management approach may be used to systematically assess whether replacement parts are functionally equivalent (i.e., like-for-like) with original parts to ensure proper change control while also preventing unnecessary revalidation activities. This case study on functional equivalence for equipment replacements is the second of eight in a series put together by the Product Quality Research Institute Manufacturing Technology Committee (PQRI-MTC) risk-management working group. The series is meant to advance the under- standing and application of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Q9 Quality Risk Management guideline by providing actual examples of risk-management assessments used by the bio/pharmceutical industry. The introductory article explaining the history and structure of the series, as well as the first case study, on defining design space, appeared in the July 2011 issue of Pharmaceutical Technology (1). In this case study, a risk-management approach was taken by the firm to identify the following: Risks associated with equipment-parts changes that Functional Equivalence for Equipment Replacements A Risk-Management Case Study (Part 2) Ted Frank, Stephen Brooks, Kristin Murray, Steve Reich, Ed Sanchez, Brian Hasselbalch, Kwame Obeng, and Richard CreekmorePharmaceutical Technology August 2011 73might adversely impact the validated state of manufac- turing equipment Risks associated with the process of determining whether original and replacement parts are function- ally equivalent Proper roles and responsibilities of the functional areas involved in the process of determining whether original and replacement parts are functionally equivalent. The outputs of the risk-management approach used by the firm included a generic, robust, and repeatable process for performing functional-equivalence assessments as well as defining organizational roles and responsibilities support- ing the process. Risk question and risk-assessment method The risk question developed for the subject case study was: What process and associated functional area roles and re- sponsibilities are required in order to assess whether replace- ment parts are functionally equivalent with original parts in order to ensure proper manufacturing-equipment change con- trol while also preventing unnecessary revalidation activities? The firm elected to craft one risk assessment for the over- all (generic) functional-equivalence assessment process to achieve two objectives: Identify potential gaps, inconsistencies, and redundan - cies within the process that had historically been used for replacement-parts functional equivalence determi- nations Identify new or improved activities that would lead to robust, efficient, and consistent functional-equivalence assessments moving forward. To support selection of a risk-assessment method, the team examined the above risk question and identified the core activities supporting the historical functional-equivalence assessment process. Core activities examined included the equipment change-control process and the maintenance- systems inventory process-control flow. The team noted the following observations: The functional-equivalence assessment process was his - torically dependent upon human judgment, expertise, and experience Process risks (e.g., potential breakdowns of the process) were qualitative in nature and difficult to quantify with specificity. Given these observations, the risk-assessment team selected Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) as its risk-assessment method be- cause it is well suited for analysis of qualitative fault condi- tions that may be related to human performance factors. Risk identification, analysis, and evaluation The risk-assessment process began with a review and analysis of the change control system to determine how equipment parts replacements could potentially cause an unwanted or undetected change to the equipment's vali- dated state. The analysis was organized into the fault-tree structure (see Figure 1). This fault tree illustrates the po-Figure 1: Fault-tree analysis (FTA) of equipment changes and associated validation impact.

The team concluded that many of the potential fault pathways were already being appropriately mitigated by robust quality systems (e.g., training, validation, and change control) that were performing as intended and that were being routinely audited. However, significant gaps and improvement opportunities were noted around the process used for the functional-equivalence assessments (see Figure 1, yellow pathway). T o further explore the risks associated with the functional- equivalence assessment process for equipment replacement parts, the risk-assessment team continued development of the fault tree as shown in Figure 2. The team focused on two key areas of risk: functional-equivalence assessments performed by parts vendors, and functional-equivalence assessments performed internally by the firm's functional areas. The detailed FTA executed by the risk-assessment team revealed two areas of significant risk where improvement was required: The Initiator (i.e., petitioner and preliminary data col - lector) for functional-equivalence evaluations should be a subject matter expert (SME) who is appropriately trained and qualified to craft accurate initial assess- ments (see Figure 2, green triangles). Specific roles and responsibilities for each functional area participating in functional-equivalence assessments should be clearly defined (see Figure 2, beige triangles).Risk control For each of the two areas of significant risk identified in the FTAs and summarized above, associated risk-control plans were established, as follows: Training curricula were created to define the training and qualification criteria for personnel initiating functional- equivalence assessments. These controls were designed to ensure that Initiators would be able to identify, compile, and/or generate the data and rationale required to support thorough and accurate functional- equivalence assessments. Roles and responsibilities for each functional area partici- pating in functional-equivalence assessments were delineated in the form of executable checklists designed to ensure that every functional-equivalence assessment will be performed in a thorough and reproducible fashion. Each organization identified in Figure 2 (Engineering, Technical Services, Quality Assurance, and Regulatory) created a checklist tai- lored to their specific roles and responsibilities that the team had collectively defined. This approach minimized both gaps and redundancies in the assessment efforts while also providing a common assessment record format to facilitate overall review of the assessment package. Each functional area checklist details unique areas of consideration for the assessment and pro- vides spaces for the assessment conclusions and the sig- natures of the assessor(s). An example checklist from the Engineering functional area is shown in Table I.PQRI Case Study Figure 2: Fault-tree analysis (FTA) of functional equivalent assessments.

Training is required to be performed on these updated documents and training records are periodically audited for compliance.Risk review As part of the firm's standard practice for the ongoing main- tenance of quality systems, routine audits and document reviews are performed throughout each of the quality sys- tems impacted by this risk assessment (i.e., training, change control, and equipment maintenance). Adverse findings or trends identified during these reviews would provide indica- tion whether the risk assessment needs to be revised. Reference 1. T. Frank et al., Pharm. Technol. 35 (7), pp. 72-79.

Tina Morris In a study released in May 2011, US regulatory approvals for biologic drugs and biotechnology products (collectively referred to as \"biologics\") were reported to have nearly doubled in the past decade, compared to the 1990s. This growing market emphasizes the need for consis- tent approaches to product quality and public standards. In its upcoming Science & Standards Symposium on Biologics & Biotechnology, \"Advancing Quality Stan- dards through Analytics and Assays,\" tak- ing place October 3-6 in Seattle, the US Pharmacopeial Convention (USP) will lead discussions on standards-setting initia- tives related to biologics and the materials critical for their manufacture as a growing number of these types of drugs enter the therapeutic space. Setting the stage for the symposium are keynote speakers Steve Kozlowski, director of the FDA Office of Biotechnology Prod- ucts, and Gillian Woollett, chief scientist at the Washington, DC, law firm Engel & No- vitt. Each will discuss the regulation of bio- logics. The following two-and-a-half days of technical sessions will include presenta- tions from an international panel of indus- trial, academic, and regulatory stakehold- ers engaged in the development of quality standards for biologics. USP topic experts will discuss general analytical approaches and what they can do for biologics; qual- ity attributes of biologic drugs by product class; and the US regulatory landscape for these products. An entire track of sessions will focus on bioassays and the assessment of biological potency, critical to all biologi- cal medicines. Quality standards set by the USP\u2014and enforceable by FDA\u2014have traditionally been developed using what's called a \"ver- tical approach,\" which is particularly suited for the characterization of small-molecule drugs. Under this approach, documen- tary standards (or product monographs) have been created for one drug product at a time, with associated reference ma- terials (i.e., pure physical samples used as reference chemicals for testing) developed in tandem with monographs. General chapters in USP's official compendium, US PharmacopeiaNational Formulary (USPNF), represent overarching infor- mation and testing procedures that apply across all or groups of monographs. These chapters broadly support product-specific (vertical) standards in the determination of identity, strength, and purity. Compared with their small-molecule counterparts, biologics are heterogeneous and more complex in their makeup. Thus, analysis and characterization are more challenging and require an even greater portfolio of good analytical procedures that can underpin product characterization. Another important issue for biologics quality is the use of ancillary and process materials that are also complex biologics. Common examples are fetal bovine serum (FBS) widely used in vaccine manufactur- ing; cytokines like (IL-4) used in the cell-therapy arena; and mate- rials like protein A, used in monoclonal- antibody manufacturing. The quality of these materials going into the manufac- turing process can have a direct impact on the quality of the medicinal product itself, especially when the end product is not highly purified and residual amounts of the ancillary material have to remain. Working through expert committees and advisory expert panels, the USP bio- logics and biotechnology department has been actively revising and developing new chapters in USPNF. Work has focused on general guidance in the form of informa- tion chapters, and also on specific test and product-class chapters that speak to the analysis of quality attributes for certain biologics product classes and the analyti- cal procedures necessary to measure them. The goal with these \"horizontal\" standards is to provide more broadly applicable qual- ity expectations in areas where analytical platform approaches already exist. Hot topics In deploying a horizontal approach to de- velop standards for biologics, USP's activi- ties in the following areas are reflected in the themes of session tracks for the Science & Standards Symposium.Biologics require a greater portfolio of analytical procedures than small-molecules. Tina Morris, PhD, is vice-president of biologics and biotechnology for the US Pharmacopeial Convention. Pharmaceutical Technology August 2011 77Inside USP Bioassays . USP has developed a new suite of bioassay chapters that includes guidance and information focused on development, analysis and validation of biological as- says. As a companion to these guidance chapters, USP has also developed example bioassay data sets and will make software analyses of the data available to meeting attendees. Case studies on analytical and compliance challenges related to bioassays as well as the assignment to biologics of quantities and values will be discussed. Critical quality attributes for biologics. In the development of product-class standards, identification of critical quality attributes (CQAs) that apply across products within a designated class is key. USP <129> Criti- cal Quality Attributes of Recombinant Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies is one example of a USP chapter in develop- ment which focuses on CQAs. In addition, USP <90> Fetal Bovine Serum\u2014Quality Attributes and Functionality Tests became official in USPNF in May 2011. Ancillary materials and process enzymes. An- cillary materials, including growth factors and process enzymes, are necessary for the manufacture of certain biologics such as vaccines and cell-based or tissue-based therapies, but generally must be removed from the final product once the manufac- turing process is complete. USP <1024> Bovine Serum addresses quality issues related to the production, sourcing, and characterization of this class of ancillary materials, with the intent of supporting its users in conducting risk assessment and implementing risk-mitigation measures. Post-translational modifications. The func- tionality of a protein-based therapy is pri- marily based on its proper structure as well as correct post-translational modifications. USP General Chapter <1084> Glycoprotein and been developed to address mod- ifications that result from the process of glycosylation. In addition, USP currently is working on two chapters addressing com- pendial procedures for oligosaccharide and monosaccharide analysis, important for the manufacture of glycosylated proteins. Analysis and regulation of bioassays. As technological improvements emerge, capabilities regarding bioassays must be updated to parallel those changes. Transi- tioning legacy products away from animal- based potency assays is an important issue for manufacturers. USP guidance chapters include <111> Design and Analysis of Bio- logical Assays, which provides direction to users on developing appropriate strategies regarding biologic potency. The topics of the conference speak broadly to industry professionals engaged in the development, analysis and quality control of biological medicines, as well as to professionals interested in the regula- tory and compendial issues related to the latest trends in biotechnology. In sup- port of its nearly 200-year-old mission to advance public health, USP is committed to continuing this global dialog among manufacturers, regulators, and practitio- ners to address the need for public quality standards for biologic medicines.

The study asked re- spondents to consider their five-year time horizon to 2015 and evaluate their facility's current plans for international (i.e., nondo- mestic) capacity expansion. For the first time, China ranked highest in the world with 17% of respondents identifying the country as a potential biomanufacturing outsourcing destination. India was the choice of 13.2% of respondents, and Singa- pore was selected by 9.5% of respondents. The United States was chosen by 15.1% of respondents (see Figure 1). The results show that the demand for biomanufactur- ing capacity in Asia in serving regional or domestic markets can outweigh manage- rial concerns when offshoring manufac- turing. This year's survey had responses from 352 global biomanufacturers and covered issues associated with production bottlenecks, budget trends, use of dispos- ables, downstream production, and quality management (1). These findings support the continuing rise of Asia as a global biomanufacturing power. In coming years, many biopharma- ceuticals originally launched in Western markets in the 1980s and 1990s, includ- ing many blockbusters, will be coming off patent. Multiple biosimilar and bio-better versions are likely to be marketed for each product, thereby resulting in a significant expansion of companies developing and manufacturing biopharmaceuticals. Al-though the great majority of biopharma- ceutical manufacturing and consumption in emerging markets currently involves biogenerics or other copies of products de- veloped by Western innovator companies, these foreign markets, although still rela- tively small, are growing at a more rapid pace than major Western markets. Inside the numbers According to BioPlan's recently released Top 1000 Global Biopharmaceutical Man- ufacturing Index, China holds 8.5% of the global concentration of capacity and employment, India 8.0%, and Japan and other Asian countries 9.2%; these areas are growing more rapidly in biomanufactur- ing capacity than the global average. Asia- Pacific has one of the largest concentration of global biopharmaceutical manufactur- ing capacity (2). Asia's combined share of 25.7% of global concentration of capacity and employment virtually matches Eu- rope's share at 26.2% and is gaining on North America's share of 37.5%. These results show that the biopharmaceutical industry is becoming increasingly interna- tional in scope and is beginning to move away from its exclusively US and Euro- pean focus as larger manufacturers locate in emerging markets to support regional markets and provide backup manufactur- ing for products in major markets. The BioPlan study suggests that biopharma- ceutical research and development, both for biosimilars and innovative products, is increasing in China, India, Russia, and select emerging markets (2). Also, many large Chinese and Indian companies are developing commercial- scale biopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities to serve domestic and regional needs. This trend is evident in vaccine manufacturing. An important develop- ment occurred earlier this year in March, when the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that China's State Food and Drug Administration was shown to comply with international standards for vaccine regulation. With a regulatory system for vaccines documented to com- ply with international standards, vaccine manufacturers in China are now eligible to apply for WHO prequalification of spe- cific products. Prequalification, which is a guarantee that a specific vaccine meets international standards of quality, safety, and efficacy, is a prerequisite for manufac- turers to supply to countries through UN procuring agencies (3).

The Bio- Plan study shows that more than half of respondents specifically sell to India and China, and 38.7% of all vendors sell in other Asian markets (2). The growth of emerging countries also contribute to a tightening of the global scientific labor markets. This year's survey showed that concerns over hiring are increasing as the global economic downturn stabilizes. Expecta- tions of constraints due to the \"inability to hire new, experienced scientific staff\" jumped from 19.1% of respondents in 2010 to 27.6% in 2011 . The survey, which compiled the factors likely to create biopharmaceutical production constraints by 2015, found that facil- ity constraints (48.6%) topped the list, followed by the \"inability to hire new, experienced technical and production staff\" (31%) and the \"physical capacity of downstream purification equipment\" (28.1%) (see Figure 2). This tightening for experienced bioprocessing special- ists may be due to expansions in growth of operations and further exacerbated by specialists increasingly spread out over a growing number of biopharma- ceutical companies worldwide.

Novak: The contract manufacturing or- ganization (CMO) industry faces a reputation issue. People think we're mediocre. There's still a stigma, a perception that Big Pharma can do drug manufac- turing better than outsourcing providers. While that perception has slightly changed during the past five years, proving the case for CMO partnership remains our most time-intensive challenge. CMOs have to be as good as the customer's own manufacturing, which means delivering finished product on time, and right the first time. The greatest strength the CMO industry now has is its strong regulatory compliance. Where CMOs need to do a better job is on-time delivery. For specialty and small pharmaceutical companies, we are their internal sup- ply, and we always have to remember that. I think a lot of CMOs have lost their customer focus due to the financial issues that have affected their businesses during the past few years. PharmTech: Do you see a new industry trend emerging? Novak: Drug delivery is still a hot topic. We see many companies try- ing to extend the patent life of an existing product before it loses exclusivity. Specifically, nanotechnology has been talked about forever, but no one has put it to commercial use yet. Everyone is still talking about ePedigree. We were preparing for the California legislation about two years ago to force this issue into becoming a trend, and although it didn't happen, I believe it's inevitable. On the packaging end, this will be a big emerging area that we're going to have to address. PharmTech: What is the most common demand your clients are currently making of you? Novak: Lately it's been formulation development for products that are poorly soluble. They're difficult to manufacture, and out- sourcing providers should be looking to solve that problem. It's an area that we've expanded into, whether it's highly potent compounds or complex controlled-release delivery. During the next few years, growth in the contract manufac- turing business will be achieved by companies that can pro- vide a quality solution to complex formulations.82 Pharmaceutical Technology August 2011 PharmTech.comProduct and Service ProfileS Alconox, Inc. 30 Glenn St., Suite 309 White Plains, NY 10603 tel. 914.948.4040 fax 914.948.4088 www.alconox.com Alconox Description: For pharmaceutical equipment cleaning and validation, Alconox's full line of products are the best choice for consistent, cost effective cleaning.

Potential solutions This lack of visibility supports the need for the implementation of data acquisition and analytic systems and processes that can help provide on-demand visibility across a company's supply chain. Such information would afford a sponsor com- pany the opportunity to better and more tightly control ingredients, components, and products supplied by third parties. Because brand owners are responsible for the safety, efficacy, and quality of their products, this control is crucial and can help manage and reduce the risk of non- conformances, corrective and preventive actions, and product recalls. To address the challenges of globaliza- tion and outsourcing, companies must im- plement strategies to provide appropriate levels of visibility across every stakeholder in their supply network.The willingness of partners to share information was a top issue uncovered by Axendia's research. When asked, \"What are your organization's concerns regard- ing increased regulatory focus on global supply-chain issues?\" nearly 60% said they are concerned about the willingness of sup- pliers to provide information. Forty-four percent are concerned about their distrib- utors' willingness to provide information required to meet regulatory requirements. This information would ensure that organizations can support the full geneal- ogy and traceability of their products, from raw materials to end users. The willingness of suppliers and contract organizations to provide that information is imperative to achieving this goal. It is not enough to look at the first link in the chain. In an age when contract organizations are also outsourc- ing, the supply chain is even longer and more difficult to assess. Brand owners, therefore, must go further into their sup- ply chains to assess distributors as well as suppliers to their suppliers. Such visibil-ity would enable downstream processes (whether local, global, or outsourced) to adjust CQAs and CPPs to compensate for product characteristics. Today, there is mature technology avail- able to support the implementation of in- terconnected and interoperable systems that provide on-demand-visibility across the supply network. This level of trans- parency would not only support PAT and QbD approaches, but also would manage product safety, efficacy, and quality. PT Reference 1. M.

Matlis In the days when pharmaceutical companies were vertically integrated, industry and regulators began to de- velop ways to change the paradigm for pharmaceutical manufacturing from \"testing quality out\" to \"building qual- ity in.\" These collaborations resulted in innovative approaches under FDA's Critical Path Initiative and included process analytical technology (PAT) and quality by design (QbD). PAT continues to drive industry to gain a deeper understanding of its products and manufacturing processes to allow for tight controls over critical quality at- tributes (CQAs) and process parameters (CPPs). This approach supports the im- plementation of control strategies aimed at improving quality while reducing the need for in-process and finished-goods testing. To collect, act, and capitalize on the knowledge gained from identifying and monitoring CQAs and CPPs, many companies have been and continue to invest significant resources in data ac- quisition, historian, and manufacturing execution systems. These paradigms were designed to en- able life-science organizations to speed time to market, improve quality, and lower costs while facilitating compliance with regulatory requirements.The outsourcing effect The pharmaceutical industry is also in- creasing its level of outsourcing of non- core activities, processes, and supplies as a means to lower costs. As a result of out- sourcing, many brand owners have lost their visibility into CQAs and CPPs. When a company does not own the equipment, it is often difficult to collect, act, and capital- ize on indicators and parameters. These data are needed to achieve PAT and QbD, and also have a significant effect on drug product safety, efficacy, and quality. Despite this problem, globalization and outsourcing are here to stay. According to Congressional testimony given by FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, \"up to 40% of the drugs Americans take are manufactured outside our borders, and up to 80% of the active pharmaceutical ingredients in those drugs comes from foreign sources\" (1). According to findings from Axendia's Life-Science Global Supply Chain research, 78% of industry executives expect global sourcing to increase, and 76% anticipate their global manufacturing to grow (2). These executives also reported that they expect the top threats in the next five years to stem from these same trends. While 74% identify contract manufacturing as a \"significant or moderate risk,\" 61% view contaminated or nonconforming raw ma- terials as a top threat. Today, visibility into the pharmaceu- tical supply chain is largely based on \"snapshots in time\" with little sharing of common practices and information. Ac- cording to Axendia's research, more that three quarters (77%) of industry execu- tives responding to the survey indicated that the primary method used to gain visibility into suppliers is a periodic audit. Only 25% stated that they share common practices and information with suppliers and only 3% said they have real-time ac- cess to their suppliers' data. An audit, although required, provides visibility into a specific timeframe. After an on-site visit, the next time a sponsor com- pany is likely to get data from the contract supplier or manufacturer is either when it receives a batch of product along with some form of document such as a quality certifi- cate or a certificate of analysis. This lack of visibility is illustrated by the low proportion of survey respondents able to gather critical information across their product supply chain in a timely manner. Only 19% of executives reported that they could obtain needed information from critical suppliers within two hours. Interconnected systems that enable \"on-demand-visibility\" (i.e., the ability to obtain relevant product information at the appropriate time to enable decisions with a high degree of confidence) within an orga- nization and its suppliers/contract organi- zations is also limited. Only 28% of survey participants said they could obtain infor- mation from their company sites within contin. on page 133Managing knowledge and monitoring quality require more effort in a complex supply chain.Has Outsourcing Derailed PAT and QbD?
