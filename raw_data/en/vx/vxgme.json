Acupuncture Acupuncture is an old healing practice of traditional Chinese medicine dating back over 4,000 years. It still remains effective today as a way to strengthen the body rather than merely treating symptoms. It is primarily used to relieve pain as well as treat other conditions. More than 3 million Americans and 200,000 children in the U.S. have had acupuncture to help relieve a symptom or condition. Because of its low side effects, it has been the adjustment of choice for many doctors across the country. It is even more popular in other countries.
