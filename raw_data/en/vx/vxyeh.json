Chapters 1 and 2 deal with various aspects of the tesk dascription and summary of results. Chapter 2, which is a collection of Task Description contributions to the annual Materials Processing in Space inventory book, tends to highlight the activities of each year. 2.Electrophoresis technology Resarch on ground based electrophoresis technology was performed in support of the ground--based methods used in calibrating, testing, and analysing methods and materials used or to be used in space and in support of fundamental electrophrresis reseaach in cell biolgoy and on candidate human kidney cell lots. Chapters 3 \u2014 8 sumnarize progress in electrophoresis technology. 3.Cell culture technology Highlights of this aspect of the project tasks were the evaluation of a new antimycotic, a relatively crucial item in space electrophoresis, as it turns out, and the evaluation of medium used in freezing and electrophoresis of cells. Only two chapters, 9 and 10, were prepared for final reporting. 4.Electrophoresis of cells This activity was by far the major activity of the project, and substantial progress is being reported in understanding the electrophoresis process as it applies to cells. Chapters 11 \u2014 19 detail assessemenbts of buffers and the role of cell parameters in density greadient, free flow, and microgravi.ty electrphoresis. 5.Urokinase assay research One of the major objectives of this research was the development of a single--cell method of UIZ positive cells. Several udnergraduats :student projects were associated with this activity. Substantial parts of chapters 20, 21, and 22 have been written by undergraduate students. At the time of closing, this problem was on the verge of being solved by flow cytometery. b. Zero--g electrophoresis Research was conducted in support of analysis, cell selection, basic principles of electrophoresis, and testing of materials and methods used or to be used in microgravity experiments. Chapters 23-29 detail the results of pre\u2014flight and post flight -research and analyses, and a number of scientific articles have been, or are about to be published. As many of these were included among these chapters as was reasonable. Others have ben written mainly by coauthors at 3SC and MSFC and are therefore not included.r* i 'i 7, Flow cytometry investigations This task was added part way through the 6\u2014year project and was not amoni, the original tasks, This powerful method turned out to strongly s+::,port the microgravity electrophoresis effort (Chapter 31), and light scattering measurements as a sorting tool for live kidney cells holds very great promise (Chapter 30). Chapters 30 .32 represent many of the findings to date, but more were being discovered at the close of the contract period. It can be stated in general that kidney cells do appear to have a light scattering signature relied to their function. CONCLUSIONS The above 7 tasks have were undertaken in support of two objectives; to carry out electrophoresis experiments on cells in microgravity and to assess the feasibility of using purified kidney cells from embryonic kidney cultures as a source of important cell products. Although both of these questions still remain somewhat open, A great deal has been learned about the electrophoretic subpopulatioas of embryonic kidney cells, and there has been considerable progress in the development of a coapbility in microgravity cell electrophoresis.i-2__^ LABORA'T'ORY UNIVERSITY 16802 College of Science Atra Code 814 Depanment of Microbiology, Cell Biology, 855-5497 Biochemistry and Biophysics January 8, 1982 Dr. Robert Naumann ES-71 Marshall Space Flight Center - Huntsville, AL 35812 Dear Bob, . In response to your letter of December 31, 1981, concerning our page in the 1982 Catalog of Tasks for the Materials Processing in Space program, I would like to suggest the following changes: 1.Funding level: I think this is now about twice the amount shown in the 1981 catalog, but the project is funded in irregular increments so I do not know how to report an annual dollar amount. Maybe it is best to check with JSC. 2.Paragraph 2, item (4) change to: (4) development of standard cells, standard cell culture methods, and standard urokinase assay procedures. 3.The entire final paragraph can be updated as follows: Cells from cultures -obtained from 26 commercially-prepared explants have been studied with respect to electrophoresic mobility distribution, growth in culture, and urokinase production. The testing of various electrophoresis buffers, which also must be used as a medium for freezing viable cells, has indicated that the low ionic strength required for effective electrophoresis in microgravity experiments compromises the viability of the cells. A buffer designated \"D-1\", which contains DMSQ and EDTA, is phosphate buffered, and is made isotonic with sucrose has been chosen for use in microgravity experiments. Optimum culturing con- ditions for urokinase production, by cells in monolayer have been established. In close collaboration with Johnson Space Center a human kidney cell explant designated \"HEK 8514\" has been chosen for microgravity experiments. In close collaboration with Michael Reese Research Foundation in Chicago, procedures have been established for urokinase assay of cultures derived from cells separated in microgravity experiments, which will take place on Shuttle OFT--3 mission.

Marshall Space Flight Center Marshall Space Flight Center, Alabama 35812 January, 1983 Kidney Cell Electrophoresis Pennsylvania State University Dr. Paul Todd NAS9-15584 $60K/year Continuing task The objective of this investigation is to repeat the %I&-011 experiment under conditions which are optimum for the viability of human kidney cells and most favorable for the best possible electrophoretic separation of those few (about 5%) cells which produce urokinase or human granulocyte conditioning factor (HGCF), and erythropoietin. This study effort will perform the gound-based research necessary to estabiisa all of the optimum experimental conditions required to accomplish the best possible electrophoretic separation of human kidney cell fractions which produce urokinase, granulocyte stimulating factor, or erythropoietin. This overall effort will include: (l) development of optimum buffer systems, (2) viability tests, (3) ground-based research on electrophoretic mobilities, (4) development of standard cells, standard cell culture methods, and standard urokinase assay procedures, (5) acquisition of the ground control data to be compared with results using cells returned from the electrophoretic separations carried out in microgravity, and (b) ground-based research on the electrophoretic mobilities of suspended pituitary cells (last task added in 1982). Cells from cultures obtained from 32 commercially-prepared explants have been studied with respect to eiectrophoret:i.c mobility distribution, growth in culture, and urokinase production. The testing of various electrophoresis buffers, which were also used as the medium for freezing viable cells in Shuttle flight STS--3, indicated that their low ionic strength compromised cell viability somewhat, and the buffer \"D-1\", which contains EDTA and DbiSO, was used in the microgravity experiments involving electrophoresis of human kidney cells and test particles (fixed human and rabbit red blood cells). Ground-based electrophoretic characterization of human kidney cell line \"HEK-8514\" was accomplished prior to the STS-3 flight, as was the characterization of the test particles. Procedures for post-flight anal ysis had been established and evaluated prior to the flight. These were not implemented, owing to the well-known post- flight accidental loss of the samples.t, ^^wPost-flight analysis of the test--particle electrophoresis data recorded - on film during the STS-3 flight has been accomplished. A time--sequence photograph (Figure 1) shows the progression of the human red blood cell band along the column during electrophoresis in flight. Optical density scans of the negatives of these photographs, provided by Johnson Space Center, were analysed by computer, and ground-- based laboratory studies were carried out to simulate the conditions of flight. These studies indicated that the migration rate of cells in space is predictable on the basis of temperature and ionic strength of the \"D-l\" buffer that was used. Collaborations with Johnson Space Center and Michael Reese Research Foundation in Chicago continue. Their purpose is the preparation of human kidney cell electrophoresis experiments that will utilize the McDonnell--Douglas continuous- flow electrophoretic separator (CFES) aboard future STS flights under the MDAC-NASA Joint Endeavor Agreement. Media and buffers suitable for this purpose are under investigation, and a very-low-ionic-strength triethanolamine electrophoresis buffer is being evaluated as is a serum-free or low-sextm medium in which cells can both multiply and produce urokinase. Media are being screened by the fibrin- plate assay method, in which, as Figure 2 shows, urokinase activates the dissolution of a blue-stained fibrin clot resulting in a clear \"lysis zone\", the area of which is related to urokinase activity. In collaboration with Dr. W. C. Hymer of The Pennsylvania State University a task to perform ground-based electrophoretic studies on suspended rat pituitary cells has begun, and results to date indicate a unimodal electrophoretic mobility distribution of this cell population, which is otherwise very heterogeneous. Separations of this cell type in microgravity using CFES are anticipated.r t PUBLICATIONS M. E. Kunze and P. Todd.

In collaboration with D. R. Morrison, principal_ investigator, and M. L. Lewis of Johnson Space Center and G. H. Barlow, co--investigator, of Michael Reese Research foundation, pre-flight culture media, electrophoresis buffer, fraction collection media, temperature profiles, and urokinase assay procedures were tested prior to flight, Electrophoretic mobility distributions of aliquots of the cell population to be fractionated in flight were obtained. The following protocol was established and utilized: Cells were prepared in suspension prior to flight in electrophoresis buffer and 10% calf serum. Electrophoretic separation proceeded in electrophoresis buffer without serum in the McDonnell-Douglas Continuous flow Electrophoretic Separator, and fractions were collected into sample bags containing culture medium and concentrated serum. Two separations were performed, and subsequent culturing and biochemical measurements were conducted at Johnson Space Center. Fractions that yielded enough progeny cells were analysed at The Pennsylvania State University for morphology and electrophoretic mobility distributions. The mobility distributions of progeny cells cultured from four electrophoreti.c fractions are shown in Figure 1, where it can be seen that the lowest--mobility fraction studied produced higher-mobility progeny while the other fractions produced progeny cells with mobilities related to the fractions from which they were collected.AEXP Iq2O 1 8514 PI 1 -1.47\u00b10.27 0- IE 1115 I E 1 3 ESOP 1530 4-96-1.30\u00b10.44 I 5 I I fill (EPM) distributions of starting mixture and 4 fractions of human embryonic kidney cells (strain HEK-$514) ,t separated by Continuous Flow Electrophoresis in microgravity and subsequently grown in cell. culture.

Plank INTRODUCTION Although precision in analytical cell electrophoresis is usually fairly high, one of the biggest problems in obtaining high accuracy in microscopic electrophoresis is the parabolic flow of liquid in the chamber due to electroosmotic backflow during application of the electric field. In chambers with glass walls the source of polarization leading to elec-- trocsmosis is the negative charge of the silicate and other ions that form the wall structure. It was found by Hjerten, who used a rotating 3.0 mm ^^ capillary tube for free-zone electrophoresis, that precisely neutra'Lizing V ^I this charge was extremely difficult, but if a neutral polymer matrix (formalde- hyde-fixed methylcellulose) was formed over the glass (quartz) wall the double,r layer was displaced and the viscosity at the shear plane increased so that electroosmotic flo g could be eliminated. This principle was applied to rec- tangular and cylindrical microscopic electrophoresis chambers by Van Oss and Fike, who used agarose coating and agarose plugs to eliminate electroosmotic flora. The reduction of parabolic flow in the chamber was verified by depth- r mobility profile determinations. Electrophoresis of cells in suspension in `' f microgravity was found to produce severe electroosmotic backflow problems, and these were managed by glow-discharge cleaning of the cylindrical glass tubesE and coating them with pure methylcellulose after treatment with a silylating compound, Dow \"Z-6040\". PRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT riL l5 +:LC3-3 Experiments were designed to determine the reliability with which methylcellulose coating of the Zeiss Cytopherometer chamber reduced elec- troosmotic b ackflow and the effect of coating on the accuracy of cell elec-- trophoretic mobility (EPM) determinations. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fixed rat erythrocytes (RBC) were used as test particles. Electro- phonetic tests were performed using 0.145 iii NaCl, 19 -' M NaHCO3, pH 7.2 as electrophoresis buffer. The batch of Dow Methocell used in this research was obtained from Dr. Hjertzn's laboratory, Biochemical Institute, The Biomedical Centre, University of Uppsala. EPM was determined at various depths in the rectangular chamber by recording the position of the microscope objective and making the optical correction, using the front and back chamber surfaces as landmarks. Each cell was timed for at least three sec in each direction by reversing polarity, and the velocity parabolas were analyzed by the method described in Chapter 4, using the BASIC program with a subroutine for coated chambers. Coating Procedure The method of Hjerten as modified by Catsimpoolas was used to coat the rectangular microelectrophoresis chamber. The coating solution was prepared as follows: a)0.52 g methylcellulose (Dow Methocel MC) was disp ml water and stirrec until dissolved; b)70 ml cold. (4\u00b0 C) water was added, and stirring was resumed in the cold room until the solution appeared clear;3-4 c)formic acid (7 ml) and the formaldehyde (35 ml) Caere added, with f stirring; d)the final solution was clarified by filtration. The chamber to be coated was rinsed thoroughly with a detergent solution, hot and cold tap water, distilled water, and air dried. The methylcellulose. solution was drawn into the chamber, held vertically, by suction and after five min was allowed to run out slowly, leaving a film of uniform thickness on the chamber walls. After draining for five min the chamber was dried at 120\u00b0 C for forty min. The coating and drying procedures were then re;jeated once more. Care was taken to ensure that no air bubbles adhered to the chamber walls during the procedure. RESULTS Figure 1 shows a typical mobility parabolas that is obtained when fixed rat IBC's are subjected to electrophoresis in an uncoated rectangular j., chamber. When the chamber is coated according to Hjerten`s procedure, the u parabolic shape of the depth-mobility profile disappears, as shown in Figure 2. When EPM distributions are derived from the depth-mobility profiles with and without coating the chamber, there is reasonable agreement, although standard deviation is somewhat higher, as Figure 3 indicates. Although the abov- results are encouraging, it can be noted in Figure 2 that the data are clustered near the center of the chamber. The methyl- cellulose coat was apparently not very thin compared to the.chamber dimensions, so there were no cells near the chamber walls due to the thickness of the methylcellul.ose coat. Although this shortcoming should not seriously interfere with EPM determinations, it was also found that the effect of coating the3-5 4' chamber was not fully reproducible, and Figure 4 is a depth-mobility profile \\ti ' obtained when the chamber was coated a second time after cleaning the first coat. The profile is not flat. #'^ DISCUSSION Although methylcellulose coating of the Zeiss Chamber dial hav q the effect of eliminating eleGcroosmotie backflow, it did not do so in a consistent, repro- ducible manner. It was therefore decided to make experimental mobility measure- ments with a clean chamber and to obtain mobility distributions by the analysis of asymmetric parabolic flow profiles, as discussed thoroughly in Chapter 4.

The electrophoretic mobility of a cell in solution is defined by its velocity divided by the electric field strength it experiences. An obvious way to measure the mobility of cells is to apply a constant electric field to a suspension of cells in a glass chamber and clock the velocities of individual cells through a microscope. Although more sophisticated methods have recently been developed (187), this micro- scope method is the classic technique in cell electrophoresis and it has been used for the bulk of research in this field (25). Tvo aspects of the microscope method can critically affect the accuracy and con- sistency of its cell mobility measurements: the electroosmotic fluc- tuations in the chamber from measurement to measurement (25), and the number of cells which can be practically measured for statistically meaningful. results. A new method of analyzing micro electrophoresic data which addresses both of these aspects has been developed. The Assumption of Symmetric Electroosmotic Flow The ease and accuracy of measuring cell mobility has always been hampered by the electroosmotic flow of buffer in the chamber. A thini layer of water against the glass walls of the chamber is polarized by ;I the fixed ne gative charges of the glass. If an electric potential isf ^. ;I i r '^I4-3 ipplied across ends of the chamber, this polarized water layer will be dragged along the four side walls toward the cathode and then forced back through the center of the chamber toward the anode because the system is sealed at both ends. This situation creates laminar, para- bolic flow* of buffer across the two dimensions of the chamber perpen- dicular to the electric field (160) (see Figure 10). The observed velocity of a cell in this chamber is the vector sum of its electro-- phoretic velocity and the velocity of the buffer at the cell position. Any contribution to the observed cell velocity due to a net drift of fluid through the chamber is eliminated by routinely reversing the field polarity and averaging left and right transit times for each cell. One can only observe true eJ_ectrophoretic cell velocities if the micro- scope is focused at positions in the chamber where the fluid velocity is zero. In the thin, rectangular chambers required for high resolution microscopy, these positions form two planes, called stationary planes or stationary levels. These stationary positions could be determined experimentally by observing chamber positions at which particles having a net charge of zero in solution do clot move during application of a field. However, no suitable particle has been found and experimenters resort to using theoretical predictions for stationary positions based on work by Smoluchowski. (160) and Komagata (91). Their theoretical, hydrodynamic treatment, which predicts stationary positions solely on the basis of chamber geometry, is based on the assumption that the fluid velocity is always symmetric; that is, that the electroosmotic velocities along all four side walls of the chamber are forever equal. The error in mobility measurements introduce d by this assumption is t examined and corrected. ^-j4-4Ali r Limits to the Number of Observations There are limitations to the number of cells which can be accurate- ly measured by the microscope method during a single experiment. This number is crucial to the statistical significance of the results. There is a natural time limit to the consistent behavior of the cells, the chamber and the experimenter. The condition of the cell surface can change with time by active metabolism and transport of surface macro- molecules, or by degeneration, particularly at extremes of pH (152). The surface charge densities of the chamber walls, which determine the shape of the internal electroosmotic flow, can change with time by direct chemical modification or by adsorption of material from the cell suspension. Also the level of concentration demanded of the experimenter will drop after a certain length of time. Given an interval of time e defined by these limits, the method of taking data determines the num- ber of cells which can be accurately measured. r t Present Techniques s In the literature, most microscope mobility measurements are made y. by First focusing at a theoretical stationary position and then record-M. ing the velocities of only those cells in good focus; these data are then used to construct a mobility histogram (25). There are certain drawbacks to this method. It does not consider the possibility of asym- metric electroosmatic flow and the resulting shifts in stationary posi- tions during mobility measurements. Furthermore, fete cells will be readily found in a single focal plane (typically 10-20 cells are measured) and the high concentration of cells required to facilitate these measurements may sometimes be difficult to obtain. Cells which 1 'f ,14-5 ; `a are slightly out of focus and measured will not be in the predicted stationary position. Although these errors may be minimized by aver-j aging data, they are usually neglected in the calculation of mobilities. fj A second method measures cells throughout the chamber depth and plots their velocities against the square of their chamber position, using the chamber center as an origin (54). The best straight lin.,-. is drawn through these points and the ordinate of this line at the square of the theoretical stationary position is taken as the average electro- phonetic velocity of the cell population. There are drawbacks to this method as well. Again, this method ignores possible shifts in the stationary positions due to asymmetric electroosmotic fluid flow. Using this plotting technique, cell data will fall along a straight line only during symmetric electroosmotic flow. Although the average mobility estimate is based on a relatively large number of cells (20--50), the natural dispersion of mobilities about this average value is ignored. This technique is therefore only appropriate for homogeneous cell popu- lations and waives the possibility of detecting mobility subpopulations. A new method of analyzing mi.croelectrophoretic data using a com- puter program has been developed which combines the most useful fea- tures of each method discussed, and resolves their inherent problems. It makes possible the mobility measurements of individual cells as positions throughout the rectangular chamber depth during asymmetric electroosmotic flocs. Materials and Methods Rat, chicken and rabbit erythrocytes, fitted with 2.5'0 glutaralde-- hyde (167), were washed and resuspended as pure or mixed populations'r i f^^l4-6 in Furc.hgott and Ponder. buffer, FPB (52), or phosphate buffer with or without sucrose (PB or PSB; see Table l) at 1.2 x 10 6 cells/ml. Mobil- Sties of these cells were measured at a constant current of 1.0 mA, at constant temperatures between 1 0-370C using a rectangular chamber of dimensions 0.7 x 14.0 x 60.0 mm 3. Cell mobilities were normalized for various viscosities to that of water at 250C, 0.8937 ceitipoise. Cell velocities were recorded with their positions throughout the depth of the chamber; 40-80 cells were timed. These data were punched into computer cards and fed to a Fortran IV program whose function is out- lined as follows: a.The 'apparent mobility', p a(x), is calculated for each cell by dividing its observed velocity, v o(x), by the electric field strength, E, and correcting for viscosity. This value includes an electroosmoti.c component. The next four steps serve to subtract out this component_ b.Using least squares analysis, a 'reference parabola' is fitted to the entire set of apparent cell mobilities and their positions. The shape of this parabola reflects the shape of the electroosmotic fluid velocity across the cham- ber during the experiment: at any position x in the chamber, the average observed velocity of the cell population, v (x) , differs from the fluid velocity, o f (x) , by a con- stant. This constant is the average electrophoretic velocity of the cell population, v a.

This curve now serves as _a reference from which all apparent cell mobilities are recalculated as true mobil- ities for cells measured throughout the chamber, not simply those at the stationary positions. e.The true mobilities are obtained by simply adding the verti- cal displacement between the apparent mobility of each cell and the reference curve, Ap a(x), to the reference mobility, pref. The derivation of this approach is as follows: The observed velocity of a cell is the sum of its electro- phoretic velocity , and the fluid velocity at the cell position vo(x) = v e + v f W (3.2) This relationship also holds for-the average observed vel- ocity of a cell population measured at any position %, v (x) = v e + o f (x) = v o (sp) + of (x) (3.3) where sp is a stationary position. From Eqs. (3.2) and (3.3) it follows that, for any cell4-9 V = vo(sp) + (v o(x) - vo(x)) and by dividing by the electric field strength, E, one obtains; u(x,vo) - uref + Aua(x) (3.4) wherep x,v 0) is the true mobility of an individual cell observed at depth x with a velocity v o Isee Figure 5). Apparent mobility points from cells sharing the ref- erence curve mobility will fall directly on the reference curve. Those data points from a population with a differ- ent mobility will fall on a parallel ' iso-mobility' curve which is vertically displaced from the reference by the mobility difference. f. The program output dis plays cell mobility data in multiple histogram form, using class widths specified by the user. This program performs a two-step analysis of data from a maximum of ei ght experiments. it is compiled under G level Fortran, requires 35K bytes of core, and averages 0.3 sec- onds execution time per experiment on the IBM 370--168. Evidence for Asymmetric Flory The regression curves from three sequential experiments with pure populations of glutaral.dehyde--fixed rat, chicken and rabbit erythro- cytes, plotted in Figure 6, demonstrate the parallel nature of iso- mobility curves in the chamber. Furthermore, the slope of these curves indicates that the electroosmotic flow was asymmetric during all three experiments. of 28 experiments with fixed erythrocytes and t.0--0.4 Cnz 0.0 0.4W 1.6 2.00.00 008 0.15 0.24 0.32 0.40 0.48 0.56 CHAMBER DEPTH, mm Figure 6.

The predicted sta- tionary levels will shift by an amount proportional to the degree of asymmetry. Asymmetric flow may be caused by an inherent difference in sur- face charge density on the front and back glass walls of the chamber (25) or by the difference in orientation of reference scratches on these walls. It may also be due to nonuniform heatipg or heat transfer across the chamber death in response to electric current or light from the microscope illuminator (25). These explanations seem unlikely in view of the lack of consistency in the degree of asymmetry observed. More likely, asymmetric flow is caused by changes in the surface charge density of the glass walls due to the adsorption of ions from cleaning agents (such as chromit- acid: Cr0 3/H2s04 or Cr03/HNO3), buffer solutes or cells. This includes the accumulation of sedimenting cells on the bottom of the chamber. The possibility of asymmetric flow in the cylindrical chamber certainly exists, but was not explored. Evidence for Parallel Iso-mobility Parabolas Measuring the mobility of a cell at any depth in the chamber, using the computer program previously described, requires two condi- ^s: that the velocity of cells with the same mobility fall on a ;le velocity--depth parabola during a given experiment; and secondly, the set of these parabolas from cells with different mobilities be parallel, during a given experiment; that is, each parabola be vertically displaced from any other by a constant (these two4-12 s '^ conditions equally apply to apparent mobility parabolas because they differ vertically from their velocity-depth curves by a constant: the viscosity correlation divided by the electric field strength. The results of electrophoresis using a mixture of glutaraldehyde- fixed rabbit and chicken erythrocytes, easily distinguishable under the microscope, in PSB at 1 0C are plotted in Figure 7 and demonstrate that both of the above conditions are fulfilled. The upper solid curve is the least squares parabola fitted to the apparent mobilities of the chicken erythrocytes, the lower solid curve is that of the rabbit eryth- rocytes. The mobility spectrum of each cell type falls around its re- spective mobility parabola, and both curves are closely parallel. Correction of Mobility Measurements due to Asymmetric Floor Table 2 contains mobility corrections due to asymmetric flow for 13 experiments. For 28 experiments, the average correction in the front stationary position was 2% of the chamber width, more than double the Komagata correction of 0.9% for our chamber which has a height/width ratio of 20. These shifts in stationary positions resulted in an average correction in mobility calculations of 0.13 pmisec/volt/cm or 15% of the average mobility value. Calculated shifts in stationary positions exceeding 31 of the chamber depth were recorded between ex- periments conducted within a three-hour period. A good approximation of average mobility during asymmetric flow is the average of mobilities measured at the uncorrected stationary positions predicted by Komagata `s formula, Equation (3.21). Using this approach, the average mobilities for each of the above 28 experi- ments were recalculated. The average asymmetric correction required^ 1 f_*111 I.0 3F wU) 0.0 U J 1.0 m 0 -- - 2 0ESTIMATED FRONT --} STATIONARY POSITIONSLEAST-SQUARES CURVE USING COMBINED DATA FROM BOTH CELL TYPES 0 ^ LEAST -SQURES CURVE USING RABBIT RBC APPARENT MOBILITIES (0 -LEAST SQUARES CURVE USING ESTIMATED CHICKEN RBC APPARENT BACK MOBILiTlES STATIONARY POSITIONS 0 0.12 0.24 0.36 0.48 0.60 CHAMBER DEPTH, M M Figure 7.

The mathematical correctness of thisapproach was not derived rigorously. The error in mobility measurements contributed by ignoring a shift in stationary position depends directly on the electroosmotic velocity gradient through the true stationary point. This gradient may i be reduced by minimizing the electroosmotic velocity. This can be accomplished by modifying the charges on the chamber walls (182) or by increasing the chamber width. An increase in width, however, may e. F result in increased temperature and viscosity gradients in that dimen- sionwhich would also cause a shift in stationary positions. Detection of Mobility Subpopulati.ons with Improved Statistics . By focusing throughout the chamber depth, the mobilities ofy `,=3 more cells can be measured more accurately than by using the convention-- 4 al stationary plane technique, for a given, time interval and cell con-.; centrati.on. At 1.2 x 10 6 cells/ml, 70 cells per hour were routinely t \u00b0^ timed and their data recorded. The mobility histogram of 72 cells obtained by this computerized analysis on velocity-depth data from a mixture of fixed chicken and rabbit erythrocytes, plotted in Figure 8,,clearly indicates the pres- ence of both cell types and demonstrates the ability of this method to detect mobility subpopulations. It represents a statistical im- provement over histograms generated from stationary plane measurements. The difference between the average mobilities of the two cell types was 0.2 pm/sec/volt/cm.

It is our experience that electroosmotic flow in a small glass chamber is generally asymmetric to varying degrees and that the resulting corrections to cell mobility measurements are significant. A computerized analysis is presented which determines \u00b0-t the electrophoretic mobilit y of cells clocked at any depth in ther -. rectangular chamber during asymmetric electroosmotic flow. Theoretical Prediction of Stationary Position X85-17 .Qthe Rectangular Chamber during Asymmetric Electroosmotic Flow}},,.- Most microscopic cell electrophoresic work depends on the theoret- ical prediction of stationary positions by 5moluchowski (160) and Komagata (91), Their theoretical, solutions are based on the assump- tion that the electroosmotic flow in a chamber is symmetric. Because our experiences with the rectangular chamber- indicate that symmetric flow occurs during less than 81 of our experiments, the existing theory for stationary position determination is expanded to include the more general case of asymmetric flow.IntroductionAsymmetric Solution for Rectangular Chambers of Height/[Width Ratio Greater than 40 Smoluchowski obtained the following equation for symmetric electro- osmotic flocs in a rectangular chamber having a width much smaller than its height or length: vf(x) _ '-gv f(+a) (3x2/a2 (3.3) i where x is the depth in the chamber measuring from the midpoint, a is the distance from the midpoint to either wall and v f(x) is the fAlec- troosmotic velocity of a fluid plane through x (see Figure 10(a)). Salving for x at which v f(x) is zero (that is, at the stationary po- sitions) yields, X = +a VT (3.6) `^1 This solution predicts a zero fluid velocity at 0.21 and 0.79 of the chamber width and it is used to approximate stationary positions in rectangular chambers with height/width ratios greater than 40 (25). The following derivation. uses Smoluchowski ts approach in solving the analogous problem with asymmetric flow. Assume a rectangular chamber of dimensions l x h x w, such that w is very small compared to 1 and h. Let w = 2a (see Figure 10(a)). Given the electroosmotic flow of a thin water layer against each wall in response to an applied voltage between the two end walls, two forces establish the laminar garabcli.c 1.ow in the chamber. One is cous pull each layer of fluid experiences from its neighbor. dvf(x) F = nA dx4-19 ^I gular where n is the fluid viscosity, A = 1 x h is the area of each fluid dv (x) ,layer, and f dx is the electroosmotic fluid velocity gradient between the neighboring fluid layers at x. Each fluid layer also encounters an equal and opposite force at the end wall of the chamber toward which it is constantly moving. This force is the pressure, P, exerted by this wall over the cross sectional area of the layer against the wall, hdx, and is given by, F = Phdx - These two forces are equated as follows: dvf(0: F = nA dx = Phdx or, d dvf(x) n(1h) d- (x ).dx = Phdx and, d 2v f (Y) P dx Solving Eq. (3.7) for vf(x) by indefinite integration yields, _ vf(x) = Z2 ^l + A'x + B' (3.8) The fluid velocities at the front and back walls, vf(\u2014a) and vf(a), are boundry conditions which determine the constants of integration, A' and B', as follows: I^a2 of (a) = and 2 V f(-a) 21aj1 - A' a + B' (3.10) Subtracting Eq. (3.9) from Eq. (3.10) yields, At of{a} - of{-a) 2a Adding Eq. (3.9) to Eq. v 1(-a) PP- 2 2ql A' is the asymmetric component of the el.ectroosmotic ,flow parabola and is zero only during symmetric flow. The e quation for electrosmotic velocity can now be written from Eq. (3.8), Px2 x v,(a) + vf(-a) -.Pa of (x) 2111 + { s (a) - (-a)) 2a + - 2 - 21l.1 (3.13 ) Because the chamber is sealed in a closed system, the net flux of fluid across its width must be zero, a I vi (x) dx - 0 -a Therefore, a Px a x av-(a) + v (--a)dx - f Pa dx = 0 -. 2ql dx + -f (vf {a) - v (\u2014a)) 2a dx + a i f -a 2012 or 3 3 3ra + (vf (a) + o f (--a)) a - Peat3. = 0 anda% Eq. (3.12) (x) = 32(vf(a) 2a - 4 {3.13) 4a Solving this quadratic for the stationary positions, x, such that vf(x) = 0, yields a vf(a) - v f(-a) + vf(a) - vf(--a) 2 X - 3 - (vf(a) + ,.rf(-a) } _ (vf(a) + v f(-a)) + (3.14) Define the quantity - vf(a) - vf(-a) vf(a) + vf( -a) = F where F is the asymmetric flow factor. Note that F will be zero for symmetric electroosmotic flow and increases in absolute value with in- creasing degree of asymmetry to a maximum of 1. E is solved by using the following clever technique introduced by Mi ito (115). Each fluid velocity parabola exhibits a maximum velocity at its apex, occurring at a chamber position defined as m. Taking the first derivative of the equation for fluid velocity, Eq. (3.13), one obtains dvf {x} 3x vf(`a)} Za (3.15) first derivative will be zero at xm dvf(xm) dx = 0 (3.16) Therefore from Eq. (3.15), _ of (a) a xm ^^ IN-4-24i .la. Although the chamber position of maximum fluid velocity, xm , is not directly measured by this method, it will coincide with the position of maximum for the average observed cell velocity, which can be direct- ly measured. Let vo(xt) = A +.Bx i + C(x')\" (3.17) represent the least squares parabola fitted to a given set of observed cell velocities obtained by microelectrophoresis, where A, B and C are coefficients determined by computerized regression analysis and x' is the chamber depth measured from the front wall. Transforming Eq. (3.17) from this front wall origin which is more practical for data collection, to the midpoint origin used in. this theoretical treatment using the re- lationship, x` = x + a yields, vo (x) = A + B (x + a) + C (x + a) 2 This equation represeuts'the average observed cell velocity at any position x in the chamber. Its first derivative yields, dvo (x) = B + 2C (x + a)dx This first derivative will be zero at x m, the position of maximum fluid velocity, dvo (xm) dx - L + 2C (x m + a) = Ci 5w^w^y (3.18)Therefore, -Bxm=2C-a4-25 and from Eq. (3.16), F = 3 (^ + 2aC) The solution is now complete. From Eqs. (3.14), (3.16), and (3.18), the stationary positions x, measured from the midpoint, in a rectangular chamber of height/width ratio greater than 40, during asymmetric flow are described by, X=3 (-\"\u00b1 F2+3)r is (3.19)l where F - 3(1 + 2aC)'t a is the chamber half width, and B and C are, respectively, the x' and 2(x') coefficients determined by regression analysis on a given ob- served cell velocity data set obtained using the front wall as x' = 0. Because it is convenient for the experimenter to estimate the _? stationary positions as fractions of the chamber width (xmax or 2a), Eq. (3.19) is rewritten using the front wall as an origin instead of the midpoint, as follows: x' =x+a=x+ 'i\"Zx 5o, at the stationary positions given by Eq. (wF \u00b1 + 3 ) (-F \u00b1 VF ----+ .3)(3.20) If the electroosmotic flow is symmetric, a = 2c , F - 0 and Eq_s. (3.19) and (3.20) reduce to the 5moluchowski result, Eq. (3.6). Asymmetric Solution for Rectangular Chambers of Any Height/Width Ratio By ingoring the perturbation of electroosmotic flow due to two side walls and the two end walls of the chamber, Smoluchowski could solve the stationary position problem in one dimension, x. The practi- cal application of his solution however, is limited to rectangular chambers whose height/width ratios are greater than 40 (25). Komagata Later solved the problem in two dimensions, x and y, by considering all four side walls of the chamber and assuming the chamber was long enough to neglect fluid floor perturbations from the end walls at the chamber center where cell measurements are taken. He derived the following equation for electroosmotic velocity , at position (x,y) in a rectangular chamber-of width 2a, height 2b, and length 1 such that 1 is much greater than a and b: of(x,y) v + P (a2-x2) cosh(mb)r]zr ('!-+l) where n is the variable integer from 0 to co, m =(2n2a) , v0 is the fluid velocity along the front and back walls and v is the fluid ve- locity along the top and bottom walls. Solving for the stationary positions along the central axis of the chamber used for cell measure- ments, (x,0), at which o f (x,0) is zero, yields,.^-:I Sa 4-27 -4 i f+125$r K (3.21) where K is the height/width ratio of the chamber, b/a. Substituting chamber width, =ax, for 2a and moving the x origin from the chamber midpoint to the front wall results in, xT = xmax {Z _ 2 + 52 ) Both Eqs. (3.21) and (3.22) assume symmetric electroosmotic flour in the chamber and reduce to the Smoiuchowski result when K = ^. The following derivation by Elaine Milito (114) adopts Komagata's approach in solving the analogous problem with asymmetric flow. Assume a rectangular chamber of height h = 2b, width w = 2a, and length 1 which is great compared to h or w (see Figure 10(b)). Also assume a constant fluid velocity along each side wall, equal at all points on that wall, and that this constant velocity can be unique for each of the four side walls. That is, v o = o f (-a) ,y) , v 1 = o f (x, b) , v2 = vf(a,y) and v 3 = vk(x,-h) where v a, vl, v2 and v3 are constants which can differ from each other. By again equating the laminar force on a fluid volume element dx x dy x 1, dvf dv f F = n (ldx) dy + (lay) dx with the force exerted by pressure P on the cross sectional end of this fluid element, dxdy, from the end wall of the chamber toward which this fluid element is constantly moving,r I F = nl (3.23) Eq. (3.23) is a second order differential equation which is solved using a se paration of variables tecanique (91).

Elaine *Milito's solution for stationary positions in the rectan- gular chamber during asymmetric flow, Eq. (3.44), requires an estimate of the fluid velocity at each of the four side walls of the chamber. Although this is possible using a technique covered in a following section, optical measurements must be taken through both the x and y axes of the chamber. Because the apparatus used for microelectro- phoresis prohibits observation through the long axis of the rectangular chamber, the derivation in the next section becomes useful. i(CI4.35 Stationary Position Estimates during Asymmetric Flow in a Rectangular Chamber of Height/Ifidth Ratio > 20 To calculate the stationary positions using Eq.

The position of maximum electroosmotic flow is determined by setting the first derivative of the fluid velocity equation to zero and solving for x.

If the electroosmotic flow is symmetric,, F = 0 and Eqs, (3.50) and (3.51) reduce to the Komagata results, Eqs. (3.21) and (3,22). For a chamber with K = 20, S i = 1.005, H = 3.098 and from Eq. (3.51), the stationary positions are given by,: x = xmax 2 + 0.1614 (--F \u00b1 F + 3.4) (3.52) Examination of Assumption (3.46) To check the possible error in the determination of stationary po- sitions using Eq. (3.52), and in the subsequent average mobility measure- ment at these positions, introduced by assumption the following calculation was done: Let v = 1. 6, v2 = 1. 0, v1 = 0. 6, and v3 = 0.2, where vo, v1, v2 and v3 are the fluid velocities along the chamber side walls as diagram- med in Figure 10(b). 'these values are chosen to reflect the maximum L4-40 ^y asymmetry rarely observed across the chambers width (due to a calculated 40% extreme difference between front and back wall fluid velocities) and to maximize the error introduced by assumption (3.46). Under these conditions of flow, Eq. (3.44), which due., aoL use the as sumption, predicts the front stationary position at 0.2475 of the chamber width; Eq. (3.52) predicts this position at 0.2374 of the chamber width, a 1% error. By using these positions to calculate the average cell mobility on a typical regression equation for a chamber with 0.7 mm width, x = \u20140.14 \u2014 3.2 x' + 13.5(x')2 a 2.3% error in average mobility calculat'ioa results. Therefore, even under the extreme and unlikely conditions assumed for this test, that is that the fluid velocity along one wall of the chamber will be eight times that of another, the 2.31 error in average mobility calculation ^f using Eq. (3.52) as a stationary position estimate in this example remains six times smaller than the average error of 15%.in the average mobility calculations using Komagata's equation for the prediction of stationary positions, Eq. (3.22), for the 13 experiments described in Chapter III, Part A. Experimental. Support for the Theory Support for the theoretical, prediction of stationary positions using Eq. (3.52) is given by three types of experimental. evidence. A j: comparison was made of average cell mobilities measured at the estimated front and back stationary positions. For the 13 experiments with .i fixed erythrocytes described at the beginning of this chapter, the i \u00b5'E average mobilities measured at the corrected front and back stationary { positions given by Eq. (3.52) were within 0.01% of each other. This4--41 contrasts to theaverage difference of 22% in average mobilities measured' at the front andback stationary positions determined by Komagata's equation (3.22) for the same experiments. A set of experiments was designed to test the uniqueness of the stationary positions predicted by Eq. (3.52). They entailed microscope measurements on mixtures of two cell types having distinguishable mor- phologies. Using Eq. (3.52), the stationary positions for each experiment were calculated independently from three sets of data: data from cell}r type 1, data from cell type 2, and the combined data from both cell,f types. Because all three data sets were obtained under the same electro- osmotic conditions for each experiment, all three stationary position estimates should be identical. The results of such an experiment using a mixture of fixed chicken and rabbit erythrocytes are plotted in Figure 7. The upper solid line is the least s quares mobility parabola for chicken erythrocytes, the lower solid line is that for rabbit eryth- rocytes, and the central, dotted curve is that for the combined data. The stationary positions determined for each curve are also indicated. The results of 7 such experiments are compiled in Table 3. The average differ(_ace in these three estimates of the front stationary position for the 7 experiments was 0.47% of the chamber width. These reliable estimates depend on at least 30 observations for each cell type dis- tributed evenly throughout the chamber depth. The average mobilities of rat, chicken, and rabbit gluteraldehyde fixed erythrocytes, measured at the stationary positions estimated by Eq. (3.52) in a standard phosphate buffer (52) at 25 0C, were compared to literature values. The mean mobilities of fixed rat and chicken erythrocytes were measured at -1.13 and -0.88 pm/sec/v/cm respectively,} Table 3.

Computers are also used in laser Doppler spectroscopy electrophoresis to resolve the Doppler shifted frequency spectrum of laser light scattered from a cell suspension under influence of an electric field (187). The union of computer and microscope cell electrophoresis work in this laboratory has yielded several satisfying results. This approach reduces one tedious man-hour required to analyze the 200 data collected during a typical microelectrophoresis experiment to a few minutes. The method organizes and error-checks these data and stores them on permanent file for future reference or reanalysis. The computer also affords a more accurate mobility measurement of cells observed in the chamber through the application of regression analysis and the asymmetric electroosmoti.c flow evaluation discussed earlier in this chapter. This computer analysis, accomplished in two steps by two main programs and a major subroutine, provides a quick, useful and realistic presentationC is a4-45 of mobility data in histogram form, and is appropriate for any micro- electrophoretic work using rectangular chambers. Flow charts of these programs are diagrammed in Figures 11 and 12. Appendix A contains a computer listing. Program 1 Description Program 1 is the first step of two in the analysis of mobility data. Its purpose is three-fold: (1) to read in acid display rats mobility data for verification; (2) to determine the chamber depth and apparent mobility for each cell (the apparent mobility of a cell is defined as its observed velocity divided by the electric field strength and normal- ized for viscosity to that of water at 25\u00b0C); and (3) to punch these calculated data on cards for regression analysis by Program 2. Program 1 Inyut Electrophoretic data from each experiment are punched into standard IBM cards, forming a data pack. Each data pack c-_rnsists of one header information card followed by a variable number of cell data cards. The header card data, format, and fields are as follows: Field Format Data card column 1-2 12 experiment number, must be equal to 'l' for the first data pack 4-8 F5.2 micrometer reading for chamber thickness 10--13 F4.2 number of reticule squares between scratches on the front chamber wall., to nearest: tenth 15-18 F4.2 number of reticule squares between scratches on the back chamber wall, to nearest tenth4--46 FieldFormat Data card column water at 25 0C, 0.8937 cp 45-$09A4description of experiment Each cell data card which follows the header card contains datar-, from four different cells with the possible exception of the last card in each data pack which may contain data from less than four cells. The data description, format and fields for the cell data cards are as follows: (^^ FieldFormat Data card columns 1--5F5.3micrometer reading of cell position 7-812number of reticule squares along which cell was clocked (reversals near the chamber walls will cause the cell to move toward the cathode and are noted by making this ` number of squares negative) 10--13F4.1cell traverse time to left (seconds, to nearest tenth) 15-15F4.1cell traverse time to right (seconds, to nearest tenth) 20--24 F5.8 cell positionl 11reticule squares time left time right cell position reticule squares time left time right blank unless last card of last data pack, then a negative sign blank unless last card of any given data pack, then equal to the number of cells from which data are recorded on this last card (1-4)r I f 3i y s jA data pack from a typical experiment with, say, 38 cell observa- tions would then consist of one header card followed by 10 cell data cards, the last card containing data from just two cells as indicated by the number Y2r in card column 80. Program 1 can process a maximum of eight stacked data packs ' _rom eight experiments at a time. One hundred forty K bytes of core, 750 output records and 8 seconds actual_ time are adequate for the compilation and execution of such a job by Program l on the IBI Ni 370-168 under Olevel Fortran. Program I Function Figure 11 provides a descriptive flo g chart for Program 1 and Appendix A contains its computer listing complete with comment cards which describe the program algorithms. HowevE cal steps which deserve further explanation.fFigure 11. Program 1 flow chart,4-484-49 .4^ Calculation of Cell Depth in the Chamber The position of a cell in the electrophoresis chamber is conven- tionally obtained in two steps. First the micrometer reading on the microscope fine--focus knob is recorded when the cell is in good focus. Then this readin g is converted to the actual distance in millimeters from the inside surface of the front chamber wall to the cell by using a nonlinear correlation curve which is graphed in the instrument manual (202). To automate this second step, four linear segments were fitted to the correlation curve. These linear segments are plotted in Figure 12, which overlays the original curve in the manual very closely. The algorithm for calculating cell depth determines which linear segment contains the micrometer reading ordinate, and then inter polates on that segment at that position for the chamber depth in millimeters. Calculation of Chamber Cross Section By Eq. (2.2), the determination of electric field strength on the cell suspension requires an accurate measurement of the cross sectional area of the chamber. For rectangular chambers, this area was observed to increase by more than -16% through the temperature range 10--370C. Assuming the coefficient of expansion is equal along both the height and width of the chamber, the cross section, A, in cm for a rectangular chamber with a height/width ratio of 20 is accurately given by xmax 2 xmax2A ( 10 ) ZO = 5(3.53) where xmax is the inside width of the chamber in mm at the experimental temperature, determined using the depth correlation algorithm just de- scribed. ti,Figure 12.

OD Q1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 CHAMBER DEPTH, MM4-51 'r Calculation of the Magnification Correction Factor The microscope magnification of the cytopherometer increases lin- early with focal length. Therefore the greater the depth at which a cell is observed, the faster it appears to move. This error is compen- sated for using a correction factor which linearly decreases with depth (1 + (F - 1) xmax ) where xmax is the inside chamber thickness, x -.s the distance from the inside front wall to the cell, and F is the ratio of magnification at the front wall to that at the back wall (202). The experimental pro- cedure for determining F is covered in Chapter II. Calculation of Apparent Cell :nobility The apparent mobility of a cell is defined as its observed velocity, vo , divided by the electric field strength it experiences, E, and nor- malized for viscous drag to that of water at 25 0C. The observed veloc- ity is determined by clocking the cell along the squares of a reticule in the microscope eyepiece, each square representing a corrected mag- nified distance of 15.6 microns. The data entry for the program requires clocking the cell along the same number of reticule squares for both its left and right measurement. Using Eq. (2.2), the apparent mobility, ua, in pm/sec/V/cm, is give n by, __ + xmax) 2 .y:^4-52 where n is the number of reticule squares the cell was clocked along (equal for both left and right measurements), t and t are, respective-- 1y, the cell migration times in seconds to the left and right, F is the magnification ratio, x and xmax are, respectively, the cell position and the chamber width in mm, I is the current through the chamber in amperes, andKT and Tj are, respectively, the specific conductivity in mho/cm. and the viscosity in centipoise of the cell suspension at the experimental. temperature, T. Program 1 Output All the raw electrophoretic data fed to Program 1 are printed out to provide a visual check for obvious errors before proceeding to the regression and asymmetric flow analysis in Program 2. Common errors include missing or misplaced decimal points, nonarithmetic characters and incorrect data fields. If an error is found, the data card is re- punched and Program 1 is run again..

About 180 K bytes of core, 1200 output records, and 15 seconds actual time are adequate for the G level Fortran IV compilation and execution of Program 2 on, the IBIS 370--168 using data from a typical electrophoresis experiment. ;:e POLY2 Input, Function, and Output POLY2 is a library routine for polynomial derivation at The Pennsyl- vania State University Computation Center (PSUCC). The center provides documentation on the control cards which invoke POLY2 and specify the polynomial degree and output format desired by the user. For each experiment, the input for POLY2 simply consists of the punched card output from Program 1: five POLY2 control cards ('PARA- METER`, 'FO1\"IIAT', TOUTPUTT, 'TR..LVSFERT, and 'EM'), the cell positions and the apparent cell mobilities, one data pair per card in standard (IOX, 2F10 .6) format. POLY2 accepts such data from one to eight exper- iments at a time. The function of POLY2 is to calculate the coefficients of the second degree polynomial which provides the least squares fit to the apparent mobility versus chamber depth data obtained from a single microel.ectrophoretic experiment. POLY2 also calculates the ordinate errors by this fit.t'tl 4--55 1I ^I POLY2 prints the results of its least squares analysis as shown in i the following example: I i; LEAST SQUARES POLYNOMIAL FIT RBC SEPARATION DEGREE = 2 POINTS FITTED = 36 *POLYNOMIALf Y = +1.934289D - 01 -6.749936D00*X**l f 9.4439366DOO*X**2 SWK OF ERRORS = 2.3092639D - 14 SUM OF ABSOLUTE ERRORS = 3.1295342D00 SMM OF SQUARES OF ERRORS = 4.8081803D - 01 The two digits and their arit.metic sign following each 'D' constitute the base 10 exponent of the eight digit mantissa which prefaces that 'D'. A single asterisk represents a multiplication; a double asterisk, an exponential. Input, Function and Output of Subroutine EXMk Subroutine EXTRA completes the analysis of mobility data by pro- viding routines for determining stationary positions in the chamber during asymmetric flow, for calculating the average cell mobility and its statistical confidence intervals, and-for generating mobility histo- grams and optimal mobility parabola graphics for each experiment. There are two sources of input to subroutine EXTRA: two punched cards generated by Program 1 containing the experiment description, desired histogram characters, and symbols and axes labeling for the Plotting routJnes; and data in CO{51ON with the POLY2 program which in- C] clude apparent mobilities, cells positions, regression coefficients, and G least squares errors.depth.4-56 The function of EXTRA is outlined by Figure 13, a descriptive flow chart, and by Appendix B, a computer listing complete with comment cards which describe the subroutine algorithms. The subroutine contains four major routines which are described here in more detail with their output format. Plot Routine As a user option, EXTRA, can plot the apparent mobility versus depth parabola for each experiment. EXTRA contains three routines, PLOTIT, SAI+1EP, and EPLOT, which use the Quick Draw Graphics System (QDGS) sub- routines to generate punched card output for graphics. All three plot- ting routines are contributed library programs complete with user docu- mentation at PSUCC. Their graphical output (punched card) is fed to a dedicated IBM 1401 computer under the execution of the PSUCC plotting ,. program, DRIVEQ, to initiate plotting commands to a Calcomp (California Computer Products, Inc.) drum plotter, model 564. Plotter output is produced on 18-inch paper and typical mobility curves are shown in Figure 6. Apparent cell mDbilities, the regression curves and the sta- tionary positions for each experiment are indicated on the plot. These plotting routines, opted for by setting the sense switch 'PLOT' in EXTRA to 1.0, provide a convenient verification of the parabola fit to the mobility data and a visual representation of stationary positions and the asymmetric profile of el.ectroosmotic flow across the chamber4-57'i `iSTART READ DATA CARDS FROM PROGRAM 1.

(3.52), derived earlier in Chapter III. For a rectangular chamber with a height/width ratio of 20, the stationary positions are given by x = xmax (. 5 + .1614 (F \u00b1 F 2 + 3.4) ) where F = 3.098 (1 + IBC), xmax = 2a is the chamber width, and B and C are regression coefficients descr ibed in the previous section of this chapter. The value of the mobility parabola at these corrected station- ary position estimates is taken as the average mobility of the cell sample. For each experiment, EXTRA. prints out the uncorrected Komagata stationary positions, the stationary positions corrected for asymmetric flow, the average cell mobility measured at each of these positions, and the errors introduced by the assumption of symmetric electroosmotic flow as shown in the following example: RUN 5: FIXED CHICK RBC, PSB, 20 DEG PLOT SYMBOL + ****^ ****ASYrZ1ETRIC FLOW AFZALYSIS*** ^****^ STATIONARY POSITIONS AVERAGE MOBILITY OF (MM) POPULATION, MEASURED AT: FRONT BACK FRONT BACK UNCORRECTED FOR ASYZ%DIETRIC INDEX = 0.1524-59 The asymmetric index given is the value of the asymmetric factor, r, for the particular experiment as previously described. The Determination of Statistical Confidence Intervals about the Calculated Average Cell Mobility The confidence interval, du, about the average cell mobility, p(sp), is determined using the equation Ali - +t(n-3, a/2 M--0 1+1+ _ n(sp-s)2 n-2 n n (EX 2) - (Ex)2 (3.55) where t is the two-tailed critical value corresponding to a given probability of error, a, sp is the stationary position, and n is the number of measurements of mobility, p, at chamber depth x (78).

For each experi- ment EXTRA can produce a set of histograms, each with a different, user--specified class width. This is elected for by setting the sense switch HIST to the number of histograms desired and entering the class width values into the array RES. A Review for Using the Programs The first step in the computer analysis microelectrophoretic data is to use the cytopherometer worksheet to record data during experiments. This serves as a guide for an ever,. distribution of observations across the chamber depth and as a reminder for other measurements required by the programs. These data are then punched into cards following the for- mat specified by 'Program 1 Input', and fed to Program 1. Data packs from a maximum of eight experiments can be stacked and run at a time. The printed out put from Program I is reviewed for data errors. If any are found, they are corrected and the data is again fed to Program 1. The punched card output from Program 1 is submitted with Program 2 after selecting the sense switches for the desired output f3rmat. Generally the plot routines are expensive and not elected. All punched card data are stored for future reference or reanalysis. y3REFERENCES 25. Brinton, C. C., Jr. and M. A. Lauffer.

Procedure for Microscope Electrophoresis Cytopherometry procedure has been covered in great detail by Seaman (152). Tenforde (167), Streibel (163) and Milito (116). A general checklist description of this procedure follows: Setup The disassembled glassware was submerged 1 hr in a 1OX dilution of chromic acid one day prior to the experiment. The electrophoresis chamber, positioned in the cytopherometer, was also given a 1 hr treat- meet with this chromate solution using a 2 ml-pipette and a rubber connecting tube for filling. Both the chamber and glassware were rinsed and then soaked in 2 x H 2O overnight to remove chromate ions from the glass surfaces. The following day, the glassware was drained and air dried while the appropriate water thermostat was connected to the cytopherometer, filled with 2 x H 2O, adjusted to the proper tempera- ture, and turned on to equilibrate. (In lieu of refilling the reservoir with fresh water for each experiment to prevent the growth of mold on1I 5-3 P;I .I the surfaces of the chamber and its water jacket, 0.5 mg/ml Na Azide was added to the bath water.) The addition of ice to the reservoir i sped equilibration to lower temperatures. Each zinc electrode was carefully filed to remove surface oxide and then fitted tightly to its proper electrode chamber (larger stopper to larger diameter chamber). Four teflon stopcocks were assembled to the glassware (without grease), two one-inch pieces of connecting rubber tubing (0.4 cm i.d.) were fitted to the sidearms, and a six-inch piece of tubing was joined to the outlet pipe on the left-hand assembly. Each half of the glassware, in turn, was held upright over a sink for the following procedure. A 25 ml pipette was filled with electrophoresis buffer and connected to the rubber hose at the sid!s arm. (Buffer from one 500 ml bottle was used throughout a given experiment for consistency; this P ` Cvolume was adequate for setup, cell suspensions, and flushing.) Buffer was then introduced into the glassware slowly to avoid bubble formation until its level entered the flush tube. Both stopcocks were then closed with 1/8 tarn and the pipette removed to fill the flush tube completely. Replacing the pipette at the sidearm, opening both stop- ?\" cocks and applying suction removed all trapped bubbles from the system. The stopcocks were then closed, the glassware held horizontally, and the electrode chamber filled with a saturated solution of ZnSO 4 to its brim through its vent using a Pasteur pipette. All bubbles were removed and the vent was corked. Both halves of the glassware, filled with buffer and electrode solution, were then bolted to their plexiglass backing, and the plexi- glass, in turn, was bolted to the cytopherometer stage while guiding5-4 the rubber tubing at each sidearm onto the chamber ends. The left end of the assembly was then lowered by rotating the stage counterclockwise and a 25 ml pipette, filled with electrophoresis buffer and attached to the drain tube, was used to prime the sidearms, chamber, and sample inlet tube. All bubbles were removed by simultaneous pressure from the pipette and from squeezing the connecting tubes. The chamber was leveled and then flushed by filling the sample inlet tube with buffer, controlling its level with the stopcock at the.left-hand sidearm, and collecting buffer from the drain tube in a 500 ml beaker. To prevent the reintroduction of bubbles and the time-consuming procedure for their removal, the sample inlet tube was never entirely drained. In preparation for physical chemical measurements on the cell suspension (or suspending buffer), the 50 ml centrifuge tube was filled (1C with 30 ml of sample and placed in the jacketed water bath along with the empty pycaometer and the clean barrel, of the conductivity probe to temperature equilibrate. The conductivity bridge was then turned on to the \"line\" position to warm up. The fine focus micrometer was set at zero and its locking screw loosened. With its illuminator on, the microscope was focused on the vertical lines scored equidistantly on the inside front surface of the Zeiss chamber, first using the coarse focus, then the fine focus. The micrometer locking screw was then tightened at the zero position and the coarse focus was not touched for the remainder of the experiment. This micrometer calibration depends on eye refraction and must be repeated for each individual. The number of squares of the eyepiece reticule, to the nearest tenth, observed between neighboring cytopherometer data sheet., designed and mimeo- graphed to provide a form which organized all recorded data. By advancing the fine focus micrometer, the microscope was then focused on the horizontal scratches scored equidistantly on the inside back surface of the chamber. The number of reticule squares observed between these lines, to the nearest tenth, was recorded. The four digit micrometer reading at this position was recorded as the chamber width (depth). See Figure 10. The electrical leads were clipped to the electrodes, the stopcocks positioned for electrical continuity, and the current turned up to the desired amperage (usually 1 mA). Result- ing voltages in excess of 600 V usually indicated the presence of bubbles trapped in a stopcock; they were removed by disconnecting the power and repeating the final priming procedure with buffer. Amperage was more accurately measured and adjusted using a volt ohm meter (Simpson) temporarily connected in series between the right electrode and its power clip. Amperage and voltage were then recorded and both stopwatches wound fully. Cell Preparation for Microscope Electrophoresis A cell suspension containing >90% single: cells was obtained by using a 5 mil pipette to disperse fixed erythrceytes. An EDTA treatment developed by Thompson (172) was used for tissue-cultured cells. (See Cell Preparation for Electrophoresis.) Cells were washed and resuspended in electrophoresis buffer at 2-5 x 10 6 cells/m1. A 6 ml suspension proved to be a minimum working volume for each experiment; 40 ml was optimal, allowing viscosity and conductivity measurements on Q Fu L 5-6 the cell suspension rather than on the suspending buffer. If the cells were unfixed, the cell stock remained on ice during the experiment. Data Taking In a typical experiment one hour was required to time 50-70 cells, using: the following procedure. The cytopherometer inlet tube was carefully drained of buffer to a level just above its stopcock, and 6 ml of cell suspension from the cell stock was introduced by Pasteur pipette.About 3 ml of this sample was admitted to the chamber followed by a 2 min pause for temperature equilibration and dissipation.of the cells' momentum. If a substantial drift remained, it was minimized by adjusting the corks at each electrode vent to equalize the fluid pressure at both ends of r the chamber. Cells near the front and back chamber walls were timed first because their numbers decreased during typical experiments. A well-defined cell was focused on, and the field switch rolled to the left, marked \"L\". The time required for the geometrical center of the cell to cross a convenient integral number of reticule squares as it moved left was recorded. The field was then reversed and the cell x, timed for the same distance in the opposite direction. This distance was normally one reticule square for slowly moving cells, and two or more squares for fast cells, such that their migration time always exceeded two seconds and was typically seven seconds. Cells moved toward the anode (at the left end for \"L\", the right end for \"R\") unless they were close to the chamber walls where direction reversals were sometimes noted, Reversals are caused by the increasing electro- osmotic buffer flow near the walls which forces cells having a low5-7n .i tenough mobility to move against the electric field force. Four data r were recorded on the work sheet for each cell measured: the four digit micrometer reading (\"X\"), the number of reticule squares traversed (\"RET\"; equal for the left and right measurement, negative to indicate a reversal), and migration time, to the nearest tenth of a second., to the left (\"SECL\") and to the right (\"SECR\"). The velocities to the left and right for each cell were calculated and averaged by computer to correct for possible net fluid drift through the chamber at the time of measurement. About 50 cells were usually timed at positions throughout the chamber depth. The work sheet suggests four measure- ments every 0.1 mm (112 turn) on the micrometer. A micrometer reading of zero at the front wall, the chamber thickness, the amperage and voltage, and the chamber level were all rechecked, and adjusted if -1 necessary, at least once during each experiment. If the majority of cells had sedimented from view, the chamber and sidearm glassware were first flushed with buffer from the left and right flush tubes and. the chamber was replenished with 3 ml fresh cell suspension. Very infrequently poor focus definition required a realignment of the microscope phase contrast optics. Trouble &hooting Three recurring problems for the cytopherometer, their probable causes and the corrective measures are covered below. If the cells do not move after pressing the field switch, the cause is probably one of the following: the stopcocks are not positioned for electrical continuity; a leak at one electrode cork has created an airgap below the sintered glass; a stopcock bore contains5-8 } air and requires flushing to remove it; one of the power clips is not connected to its electrode; or the power s-ipply has blown a fuse. If the cells move in only one direction independently of the field direction, the problem is excessive drift. This can be caused by a leak occurring at an inadequately sealed joint in the glassware, by unbalanced fluid pressure at the electrode vents or from unleveled glassware, or by temperature instabilities. I\u00a3 the glassware is leveled and sealed., and temperature equilibrium has been reached, drift can usually be minimized by adjusting the fluid pressure exerted by the corks at the electrode vents. If reversals (cell moves toward cathode) are observed throughout the chamber depth, a net elec:troosmotic flow is occurring because the system is not completely sealed. The usual remedy in this case is to top up each electrode at its vent and firmly seal it with a cork. Beyond this, the glassware can be disassembled, cleaned with chromic acid, and reassembled using new rubber ,joints while checking for cracks. Some of these corrective procedures warrant rescue of the cell sample from the inlet tube using a Pasteur pipette.15' 7777 -13A,Al CAM-APPARATUS MICROELECTROPHORESIS SYSTEM with Ag/AgC1/KC1 Electrodes I. PREPARATION OF ELECTRODES 1) The solid silver electrodes must be scrupulously clean and dry prior to ,,oating with AgCl. Clean as follows: (a)T.mmerse in cone. ammonia solution to remove oldcoating (use hood). . (b)Polish with fine emery paper. forceps and 'Kimwipes'). (d)Rinse in ether. (e)Allow to dry. 2) Assemble an electrochemical cell using a spare silver electrode and a constant current power supply. Immerse both electrodes in 0.IM HC1'so that they are parallel to each other (for optimum coating uniformity). (a)With the spare electrode as anode, apply ca. 50mA for some 10-15 s. Vigorous gassing will occur fromthe electrode to be chlorided. Remove this electrode from the electrolyte and re-immerse to remove gas bubbles. (b)Reverse the polarity and apply 2-3 mA or less. Coating uniformity will be improved by using lower currents and longer times. ASSEMBLY .OF MICROELECTROPH.ORESIS APPARATUS Refer to fig.1 for an exploded view of the CAM-APPARATUS electrode housings. 1)Ensure that all 0-rings and the sintered glass discs are seated firmly. 2)The glass two-way stopcocks should fit snugly into the plexiglass ports and must be held tightly by the knurled screws.II..i.5-11 3)Fill the electrode chambers with 0.15 M KC1 ensuring that no air bubbles are trapped anywhere within the chambers. Insert the electrodes allowing the glass-impregnated teflon tapers to form an efficient seal. N.B. If buffers of lower than physiological ionic strengthare to be used it is desirable to use a KC1 solution of comparable molarity in the electrode chambers. 4)Attach the plexiglass blocks to the matching metal plates. These can then be mounted directly on the Zeiss Cytopherometer stage. Using silicone rubber, or similar, tubing, join the rectangular electrophoresis chan4ber to the short lengths of glass tubing inserted into the plexiglass housings. 5)Attach syringe housings to the filling ports to serve as funnels. Flush the system with distilled water, removing KC1 solution which has leaked through the sintered glass discs. Load the system with buffer being careful to remove all ^ir bubbles betwo\"n the *w q ptor oghn k 6} Attach the constant--current power supply leads to the electrodes and switch on.. R.j. Typical operating voltages are in the range 150-200 volts. Refer to Table I for typical operating currents for standard buffers. III. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 1)Check that the water-bath is adequately filled with clean water.(Use of double-distilled water will help to minimise microbial growth.) Regular draining of the complete system is necessary. N.B. The pump and thermostat unit contain mercury switches and, therefore, must be disconnected from electrical power whenever they are placed in an horizontal position. 2)Adjust the temperature to 2510.2 oC by balancing thermostat control of the heating coils against the flow of cold tap- water through the pump cooling coil. G5-12 3) Checkelectrical continuity of the electrophoresis system y.--voltage and current readings should fall near the values shownin Table I. 4) Afterequilibration of the electrophoresis chamber to 25 oC,and with thy. phase optics correctly aligned (see ZeissManual for alignment procedure), the chamber depth and magnification readings may be carried out as follows: (a)Using the coarse and fine adjustments on the micrometer, focus on the vertical lines etched onto the inside of the front wall of the chamber. Ensure that the chamber flat is vertical. Do not touch the coarse focus again. (b)Set the micrometer fine adjustment to zero. (c)Measure the line spacing in units of eyepiece reticule divisions. (d)Now focus on the horizontal lines etched onto the back ;gall of the chamber and note the micrometer reading. (e)Mea^izre the line spacing on the back wall in units of eyepiece reticule divisions. -^ N,B.The front and back wall focus and corresponding micrometer readings should be repeatable. On account of wear of the micrometer movement it is desirable to check perioically for uniformity of response of this adjustment by measuring the depth of the chamber s 1,arting from different initialpositions of the fine adjustment. In user the calibrated fine adjustment must be used only over the range of uniform response. 7aBPA they Qh;ab6V With ca ll 441tabla concentration being ca. 10 6 /ml. If the concentration is too high interaction between individual particles will occur and focussing at the deeper levels of the chamber will be difficult. Close both stopcocks and adjust the rotating stage so that the chamber is horizontal as indicated by the bubble level. 6) Check that, in the cells do not drift should merely fall Drifts may arise t: bubbles, or to the equilibrium.absence of an applied electric field, in one direction or another. Cells under gravity in this situation. hrough improper sealing, presence of nor-establishment of temperature5-13 7) Mobility data is collected throughout the chamber depth. i.. ) For each cell in focus record the micrometer depth reading and the times for left and right traversal of a fixed number of reticule divisions. The latter is also recorded and will vary depending on the depth of the measurement. N.S. (1) Transit times should be in the region of 5-10 seconds. Shorter times may lead to Brownian motion errors and operator timing errors. Inaccuracies due to particles falling out of focus, etc., may have a pronounced eff6ct if much longer times are used. (ii)Velocity reversals may occur near the front and back walls. These are recorded by assigning\" a negative sign to the n 1aaber of reticulespacings traversed. 8)Periodic checks should be made of temperature, current, voltage, levelling, and drift. 9)The viscosity and electrical conductivity of the buffer solution at 2500 must be determined. (a)Electrical Conductivity Measurement: A #3403 conductivity cell in conjunction with a Model 31 conductivity bridge (Yellow Springs Instrument Company, Inc.) is used to determinebuffer electrical conductivity, ensuring that the buffer temperature is 25 00. (b)Viscosity Measurement: An Ostwald viscometer and a 25 ml used to measure buffer viscosity. (i)Rinse-viscometer-with double-distilled water. (ii)Load with 4 ml 2xdH2O and measure flow times until two consecutive readings are comparable. (Ensure that water-bath is at 25 oC, at which temperature the flow time is 76--80 seconds.) (iii)Load with buffer and repeat (ii). (iv)Rinse viscometer with distilled water and acetone and store dry. (v) Weigh clean and dry pycnometer. (vi) Fill with double-distilled water and weigh. (vii)Fill with buffer solution and weigh. (viii)Rinse with distilled water and acetone andstore dry.

DISASSEMBLY AND CLEANING 1)Remove electrodes and store in KC1 solution, 2)Remove plexiglass housings and rinse thoroughly with distilled water. Leave to dry. Complete disassembly is not normally required unless the sintered glass discs need replacing. 3)Cleaning of the electrophoresis chamber may be performed in situ ^(a) Rinse with distilled water. (b) Fill with formaldehyde solution and leave for 15-20 minutes. . (c) Rinse with 95% ethanol. (d) Rinse with ether. (e) Leave to dry. N.B. (i) Cleaning should be accomplished by the least drastic method possible to avoid destruction of the glass surfaces or the adsorption of extraneous materials, either of which can produce changes in the electro-osmotic flow of liquid across the surfaces. (ii)If the above cleaning procedure is not sufficient try 30% f ormic acid anci/or 6% NAC1 'solution. (iii)If a detergent is used, the chamber must be thoroughly washed, first with a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid and then with large volumes of water to ensure complete removal of the detergent. (iv)Cleaning agents containing chromate ions are not recommended, since these ions, which are polyvalent and highly toxic, are very strongly adsorbed to glass and can only be removd by washing in flowing water for 24 hours,, (f) The outer surfaces of the chamber will occasionally become dirty necessitating removal of the chamber and cleaning with tissue.fA 0I5-15 V.

Vertical Ficoll Gradient.1 hN85-3156.2 j' ELECTROPHORETIC MOBILITY OF CELLS IN A VERTICAL FI,COLL GRADIENT . ` Lindsay D. Plank, Paul Todd, M. Elaine Kunze, and Richard A. Gaines It was found experimentally in early work that the upward migration of living cells and test particles under the influence of a constant electric field in a low-conductivity Ficoll gradient occurs at nearly constant velocity. In the course of migrating for 2 - 3 hr over a distance of 2 - 4 cin upward moving particles encounter changing density, viscosity, conductivity, and neutral-polymer concentration.. All of these factors affect migration rate, but the most important are viscosity and neutral polymer concentration. decreasing viscosity as the particles migrate upward has the effect of speeding them up; decreasing neutral- polymer (Ficoll) concentration, on the other hand, slows particle migration, since electrophoretic mobility increases approximately linearly with Ic neut.rai-polymer concentration. Neutral polymers interact with the cell surface to effectively raise its zeta potential. An analytic function was developed from the known dependence of these physical variabl.es on migration distance; it expresses migration velocity as an explicit function of position in the density gradient. It predicts an almost linear increase in velocity of about 12 - 16% (depending on call type) over the working region of the gradient. It has been numerically integrated by computer and found to correctly predict cell migration distance-vs.-time curves without the use of any fitted parameters. These resulting migration curves follow the expected slowly-varying exponential form that closely resembles a straight line. The ability to determine standard electrophoretic mobilities from such curves depends on knowledge of the effect of Ficoll. on the zeta potential of the cell type being separated. Supported by rational Cancer Institute Grant ROI-CA-24090.a s6-3 * rr RESULTS The effect of varying Ficoll concentration on cell electrophoretic mobility (EPM) was determined by microelectrophoresis of glutaraldehyde-fixed rat and rabbit erythrocytes (RBC) in various concentration of Ficoll in \"ceiling\" buffer (for buffer compositions, see Chapter 12) at low ionic strength, T/2 . 0.030 M Figure 1 shows that anodic mobility increases linearly with Ficoll concentration, as predicted from the work of Brooks et. al.. Thus the effective zeta potential, of cells will decrease as cells migrate upward tbrcugh a gradient of upward--decreasing Ficoll concentration. This variable is included in the migration equation, in which migration velocity V (x) is implicityly dependent upon migration distance x: V (x) u (x) n (HO) T - 2.a zg CPO - A (x)1 n (x) A K (x'. 9 n (x) {1) and the variables that depend on migration distance are: ^) n (x) be\" viscosity (2) R (x) K.i+Kzx + K3x2 conductivity (3) P (X)'- rj+--2x density (4) U (x) - m l+ m2x mobility (from Fig. 1).

Equation (6) was integrated numerically by computer for various cases, and Figure 2 shows an o example in which the upward migration of fixed rat RBC's was predicted using the data of Figure 1 and a 2-8% Ficoll gradient under the conditions specified in the diagram.6-4 0Below the break in the graph, migration is almost linear with time; actually, it is-a slowly-rising exponential function (equation 6). Above the break the , inverse dependence,-Q(x)/C(x), becomes . mildly apparent. - - Figure 3 indicates that, in the real experimental situation, equation (6), the dashed lines, very closely predicts the upward electrophoresic migration of fixed rat and rabbit erythrocytes. Once it was established that a single value of EPM could be used to successfully predict migration distance, equation (6) was applied to the-- prediction of the distribution on the density-gradient column of cells subjected to a specific electrophoresis procedure. The EPM distribution was determined for fixed rat RBC's by microelectrophoresis; this is presented in Figure 4, which predicts a mean EPM of 1..22\u00b10.06 um-cm/V-see at 4\u00b0C, the operating temperature of the density gradient. Each histogram subclass in Figure 4 was subjected to the calculation of migration distance using equation (6), and the resulting distributions of cells on the density gradient column were determined at various times. These are shown in Figure 5, which includes an experimental profile for comparison. The experimental data indicate that the cells did not migrate as far as predicted, and the coefficient of variation was greater, probably owing to cell band distortion that results from the cell collection procedure. CONCLUSION From simple physics and the known dependence of EPM on neutral polymer (Ficoll) concentration it is possible to predict the upward anodic electrophoresic migration of cells in a Ficoll density-gradient column. Predictions are consistent with experimental data, and both theoretical and experimental plots of migration distance vs. time are approximately linear. From these facts it is possible to characterize: a cell population by its EPM found by density-gradient electrophoresis, and at 4\u00b0C with no viscosity correction, one can define Ficoll-column mobility as xKA tr (7)O RAT RBC A RABBIT RBC L/6-5 where I-current, A-column cross-sectional area, K=conductivity, and x/t. is a good approximation of v(x). The predicted distribution of cell; on the column is narrower than that observed; this is probably due to the increase a^ in apparent bandwidth that occurs during the collection of cells in fractions from the column.

Gaines, and Paul Todd Althouse Laboratory, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802 Density gradient electrophoresis permits the separation of cell types according to surface charge density with very high resolution. Any source of flow compromises the resolving power of density gradient electrophoresis. Although procedures have been devised to successfully::' cou;iteract electroosrotic and convective flows, the final collection of separands requires that they be pumped out of { the electrophoresis colu: s^ . Experiments were therefore designed to test the h t g hypothesis that this flow could also be eliminated by trapping the separated bands in a gel, from which they could subsequently be collected with high ;tee resolution by slicing thin bands from the cylindrical gel. Glutaraldehyde-fixed rat and rabbit erythrocytes were used as test particles in a phosphate-buffered isotonic Ficoll-sucrose density gradient in a 2.2 errs diameter, there-ostated vertical glass colum - (Prep. Biochem. 3, 383, 1973). A special colu:.n design permitted passage of a plunger-in at one end and the formed gel out at the-other. x Two types of agarose were used as gel pol}maersr Electrophoresis grade agarose (J. T. Baker Chemical Co.) at final concentrations of 0.1 to of 1.5'. Electrophoretic saparability of the test particles and fluid stability were tested independently in the range of temperatures (32 -- 55 C) at which the agaroses were liquid and found to be relatively unaffected. Zhe experiments demonstrated that the higher te. ,a.perature required and the presence of agarose compromised neither the stability of the density gradient nor- the migration properties of the cells.

E. !Suns#, L D. Plank, R. A. Gaines, and P. Todd 403 Althouse Laboratory The Pennsylvania State University University park, Pennsylvania 16902 INTRODUCTION Two of the factors that affect achievable resolution In the separation of cells by density-gradient electrophoresis are related to the procedure of obtaining cells after they have been separated. Disturbance of cell-containing zones as they are removed from the column and sedimentation of cells from one none to another compromise the purity of fractions harvested by drop collection. The elimination of the time and motion involved in pumping or draining Liquid from the column after cell separation should therefore improve electrophoretic resolution. Disturbing fractionation procedures could be avoided if the cells could be trapped in a gel matrix after separation and the gel sliced into bands for the collection of fractions without perturbing the cell-containing zones. Trapping separated cells in a gel would also have applications in remote operations such as column electrophoresis aboard the space shuttle and in. semi-automatic devices that might be used in the future. Experiments were therefore undertaken to assess the feasibility of all \u2014 reversible gels in density-gradient electrophoresis in a vertical column. Fixe erythrocytes were used as test particles and, after considering several gel-forming polymers, agarose was chosen for testing as gel matrix material. The migration of test particles in the reversible gal and their ability to be trapped in position were tested. Fractionation Procedures were not tested in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS C.e_li\"s_ Rat and rabbit erythrocytes were diluted from fresh, unheparini:ed blood into 0.067 11 Sorenson's buffer and washed and fixed in the same buffer in 2.5% ?lutaraldehyde for 10 ain- After two mort centrifugations in the same. buffer the cells were stored in 0.195 i j HaCI, 0.1 mU Na bicarbonate (1,2). Gels. Two types of agarose were used. The an agarose Corp., Because this a.garose remains fluid at room temparature, it is especially useful with live cells. \u00a3ieet.rvo.h.o.resi.s. Tha column electrcphorasis method of Bolt: at ai. was -..sad with some modifications. An aII-glass column was constructed so that both ends could be opened completely for gel extrusion. This arrangement required additional adaptations as do.ser:bed in rigure 1. Polgacryiamide gel plugs formed in Lhe side-arms and ends isolzted the elect rophore.s:s column from the electrodes. Two-hole rubber stoppers formed the ends of the columns. The gel plugs were formed with the column oriented so that gravity established the plug shapes and, when necessary, balloons were inflated in the electrode vessels to prsvide a Surface against which gels _ouid form. Huffer solutions andORIGINAL PAGE' IS 7-3 OF POOR QUALITY. I i ^s eIectrode solutions were is previously described (4,5). C Procedure_ In the case of regular agarose, it was dissolved in \"C-1\" buffer (5) normally used to for the density gradient, but Ficoil was omitted while sucrose was at isotonic concentration. The final agarose Loncentration was d. 2%, which is 1iq*aid above 50 C a.nd solid below 30 C. Thus, the column temparature was held at 57 C with thermostat water at that tem perature while the agarose solution was admitted at the bottom of the column, foIlowe.d by the cell suspension (fixed cat ind rabbit erythrocytes, 20 millioniml each). The temperature remained at 37 C until the end of cell separation, and the column_ was cooled with thermostat water at 4 C until the gel solidified for extrusion. In the case of Sea Prep agarose it was possible to use a procedure more compatible with eali viability. A normal Ficoil density gradient was used (3,5), and agarose was dissolved at 1.5% in all solutions at 37 C. The column was loaded from the bottom, first with \"C-1\" buffer, then with gradiant, cells, and \"floor\"(5) all containing agarose at 37 C. The column temperature was than brought to 32 C where Sea Prep remains liquid, and upward cell electrophoresis was performed. The column temperature was slowly reduced to below 15 C, and the t gel was extruded through the top of the column after removal of overlying materials_ RESULTS The results of a tail separation with ordinary agarose at 57 C are illustrated in Figure 2, which consists of photographs taken every 34 min as ^- upward cell migration proceded. Although a clear separation of the two types of _ erythrocytes (rat and rabbit) occurred, the temperature required was incompatible with cell viability. No density gradient was used, yet the fluid column remained stable at the operating temperature. Before SeaPrep agarose was used in coniuntion with a FieoIl gradient preliminary evaluations of electrophoresis at the elevated temperature were made, as it is normal to operate the column at 4 C with this density gradient. The shallow density gradient remained stable through a three-hour tent at 32 C, as indicated by Figure 3. Over a similar period of time the electrophoresic mi5-ation of a zone of fixed rat erythrocytes was normal, as indicated in Figure 4. it was found possible to shift, during a successful separation of rat and rabbit erythrocytes, from 10 C to H C without compromising he migration pattern of the cells (Figure 5.). Thus the density gradient and electraphoratic pattern in the column were found to be stable through a wide temperature range. The migration of rat er ythrocytes was examined in the 1,5% aeaPrap Ficoil gradient column and found to be normal, as can be seen ifn Fi gure 4_ The migration was linear, as predicted 0), bu-t the band was broadened, possibly due to the time allowed for temperature equilibration before apply.ng current. The column was cooled slowly to 10 C and extruded in a 4 C coldroom. .t was found that cooling too rapidly ifta.r the completion of electrophoresis can lead to convection that compromises band sharpness. niscussion r The reversible gal procedure is, in principal, usable for density-gradient - _^ cell separation_ To this point it has not been proven to improve. resolution of separation, but it has the potential of providing a harvesting mechanism where_Ci 7 \u20144 l.'i^vS.:^i'3 fie.. 4 ii^. iY:.

EXPERIMENTS ON CELL-CELL INTERACTIONS Paul Todd and Stellan Hjerten Institute of Biochemistry, Biomedical Center, University of Uppsala, Box 576, S-751 23 Uppsala, Sweden Summary Free-zone electrophoresis is the horizonfal electrophoresis of materials introduced into a rotating quartz tube as dense zones. The progress of electrophoretically migrating zones is monitored by scanning the tube with an ultraviolet photometer. The absence of fluid flows in the direction of migration permits direct measurement of electrophoretic velocities of any material (small molecules, macromolecules, particles, cells). As sedimentation is also orthogonal to electrokinetic motion, effects of particle-particle interaction on electrophoretic mobility can be studied by free-zone electrophoresis. Fixed erythrocytes at high concentrations, mixtures of fixed erythrocytes from different animal species, and mixtures of cultured human cells were studied in low ionic strength buffers. The electrophoretic velocity of fixed erythrocytes was not altered by increasing cell concentration or by the mixing of erythrocytes from different species. Concentrations up to 2 x 10 9 cells/ml were used. When zones containing cultured human glial cells and neuroblastoma cells were permitted to interact during electrophoresis, altered migration patterns occurred. As in the case of molecule- molecule interactions previously studied by free-zone electrophoresis, cell-cell interactions appear to depend upon cell type. Cd r 5...J Introduction Free-zone electrophoresis (FZE) in a rotating tube (1) has been applied to the study of proteins (2) and cells (3) in buffers of widely varying composition. The method has been applied also to the study of the interaction of samples in two zones when the zones electrophoretically collide with one another (1-4). Any subsequent mobility changes are attributable to the occurrence of a chemical reaction during collision. The intaraction of animal cells during electrophoresis in free fluid is difficult to evaluate due to dropie t, or zone, sedimentation at high cell concentrations (5). But Omenyi and Snyder (6) have presented data that erythrocytes might interact at high concentration, and evidence concerning cell--cell interaction was sought in experiments with human and rabbit erythrocyte mixtures in the microgravity environment, where zone sedimentation does not occur (7). The results of microgravity experiments, although consistent with a lack of cell-cell interaction, were not firm and unambiguous; the optical images available for analysis did not show two clearly separated peaks (7-9) . Previous studies using FZE (3) indicated a lack of aggregation of fresh erythrocytes under all. conditions of ionic strength and buffer composition tested; however, microorganisms aggregated under a wide variety of buffer conditions at high concentration and high field strength. This aggregation occurred abruptly after prolonged exposur- (ca. 30 min.) to high fields, Because Zone sedimentation does not affect electrophoretic migration in FZE, and because this method also reveals interactions that affe.,.t electrophoretic migration, FZE was chosen as a means of e, ,ploring possible effects of animal cell interactions on electrophoretic mobility.C c^ M8-3 Materials and Methods Cells. Human erythrocytes were obtained from a 47-year-old healthy male donor by venipuncture and immediately diluted into isotonic phosphate buffer containing 0.01$ EDTA as anticoagulant. After three rinses in this buffer the cells were suspended in 2.5% paraformaldehyde in isotonic phosphate buffer at ambient temperature (19-24 \u00b0C) for 2 weeks. Rabbit erythrocytes were obtained from a 6-month-old healthy New Zealand white rabbit by ear venipuncture and treated subsequently in the same manner as the human BBC's (7) . The cells were washed 3 times in electrophoresis buffer \"D-1\" prior to experiments. Two strains of cultured human cells were used: Normal human cells of glial origin, \"787CG\" and neuroblastoma cells \"SKNSH-5YSY\", kindly supplied by Dr. S. Pahlmann of the Wallenberg Laboratory, Uppsala. They were suspended from monolayer culture by rinsing 5 min in 0.02% EDTA in phos-phate-buffered isotonic saline (PBS) at 37\u00b0C in 0.25% trypsin (1-300) in PBS. The action of trypsin was stopped by the addition of complete culture medium (Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were removed from medium by centrifugation and suspended in buffer C-1 with blood-collection buffer and the cell-fixation buffer are described in Table 1, which lists the concentra- tions of the ingredients. The electrophoresis buffer used for RBC electrophoresis, designated \"D-1\", and the buffer \"C-1\" used for cultured human cell electrophoresis are also described in Table 1. Electrophoresis. The free-zone electrophoresis apparatus (1) , consists of a thermostated rotating horizontal tube coated with methylcellulose to prevent electroosmotic xt8-4 back flow. The RBC experiments reported here were performed with the following parameters: temperature, 14\u00b0C; tube rotation speed, 70 rpm; tube diameter, 3.0 mm; conductivity of buffer, 0.90 mmho/cm; applied current, wavelength, 320 or 290/320 nm ratio; column scanning interval, 5 min; column scanning time, 1 min (with field turned off). Cells were introduced in two starting bands at the \"origin\" of the tube 2 cm apart at concentrations of 2 x 10 9 cells/ml. The cultured human cell experiments were performed under the following conditions: temperature 3\u00b0C; conductivity of buffer, 1.5 mmho/cm; applied current, 4.0 mA; potential, 1450 V. Other conditions were the same as for RBC experiments. Optical scads were recorded, usually at 5 min intervals, on paper with an analog strip- chart recorder. Table 1.

The two individual cell types continued to migrate with their original mobilities. The aggregates that formed during collision contained both cell types as indicated by their simultaneous presence in fraction 6 in the top figure, where the glial cell count has been multiplied by 5.F 8-8 the field could be followed. Their mobility was lower than that of the individual cell types. After the field was switched off, and the cells were collected from the tube in 2 cm increments, most of the cells of both types appeared in the fraction that contained the aggregates. Discussion This study has confirmed previous findins (3) that erythrocytes do not interact with one another in a way that affects electrophoretic mobility and has extended these findings to very high cell concentrations, mixtures of cells from different species, and conditions encountered in preparative cell electrophoresis. On the other hand, living animal cells do interact, consistent with earlier observations involving microbial cells and leukocytes (3,4).

Free-zone electrophoresisconsists of horizontal electro- phoresis of samples applied in a small liquid zone in a hori- zontal capillary tube rotating at 60 rpm. The rotation and narrowness of the tube prevent purterbations due to sedimenta- tion and convection from affecting motion in the direction of the applied electric field. Ultraviolet absorption scanning is used to determine the location of sample materials in the tube. This method has been used to determine mobilities of macromolecules and bacterial cells; experiments were therefore undercaken to test it in analytical and preparati+e animal cell electrophoresis. Fixed erythrocvtes from rat, rabbit, andchicken and cultured living human cells were used as test per ticies. Cells were electrophoresed in a Ficoll-containing medium having conductivity of 0,5 mmhos/cm; field strengths used were around 100 Y/cm. Itigration rates were around 20 cm/h, _nd cells differing in mobility by 20'. were separated by 4 cm. True mobility distributions of fixed test cells were determined. and coefficients of variation were around 4%. Separated cells were removed by syringe, and fractions Bb-99% pure were obtained. The maximum separated sample size was 3 x 10' cells, and viable cell fractions were obtained when living cultured cells were used.

At 3 pg/mi. Econazole reduced slightly the growth rate of T-IE cells but did not detestably affect the other end points. Key words: Econazole; antifungal announced 4-dichloro-p- 1p-ehlorobettzyloxyl-phenetyl]-imida-zole) is an efficient antifungal agent that is not toxic to mammalian cells in culture. The quanti- tative toxicological tests used were the ability of cells to replicate virus, rate of DNA synthesis, and rates of RNA and protein synthesis. It was concluded that I Ngltul could be used safely and, on the basis of these tests, would not be toxic to cells. Many applications of modern cell culture include the requirement that individual cells form colonies when plated at low density. This end point is one of the most sensitive tests of viability because it requires that several cell functions re- main unaffected. Furthermore, the rate ar which single cells multiply to form colonies is a yet more sensitive test of cellular metabolic and molecular integrity. We therefore performed a series of experiments in which effects of Ec.;.tazole on plat- ing efficiency, cell multiplication rate, and pro- gression through the cell cycle were evaluated. Certain cell purification procedures subject cells to higher than normal risk of fungal con- tamination. A biochemical or secretory function is frequently demanded of cells after separation.

The plating efficiency of cul- tured human T-1 E cells was not affected by a range of concentrations of Econazole cons idered effective in fungus control, as indicated in Table 2. Attachment efficiency. The percent of early passage cultured human kidney cells able to at- tach and spread within 18 h was not affected by Econazole present at recommended useful con- centrations, as indicated in Table 3. Growth rate. Econazole at 1 leg /ml did not introduce growth or division delay, nor did it modify the colony doubling time of human T-1E cells, as the growth curves of Fig. 1 indicate. At 3 pg/ml there seemed to be a 10% increase in doubling time, but no indication of division delay. Cycle phase distribution.

The inte- grated differences between the DNA distributions of control cells and cells treated with 1 and 3 pg/ml were, respectively, 3.94 t 0.87% and 4.36 t 4.25 %. These differences are too small to be significant, inasmuch as identically treated cul- tures, including controls, when pairs were com- pared differed by 5.01 :1- 3.50 % in the same ex- periments. Apparently Econazole does not per- turb progression through the human cell cycle by the introduction of delays in specific phases. Specific enzyme production. The production of urokinase by cultured human embryonic kidney cells in high glycine, serumless production medium is not altered by 1, 3, and 5 pug/ml TABLE 3 EFFECT OF ECONAZOLE ON 24 H ATTACnMENT EFFICIENCY OF HUMAN E MBRYONIC K IDNEY CELLS results of fibrin plate tests and colorimetric assays shown in Table 4. After 4 d in Econazole, standard cul- tures produced 55 CTA U/ml of urokinase, and cultures treated with 3 )tg/ml Econazole pro- duced 60 CTA U/ml. The similar size of the thrombolytic zones also implied that no change occurred in the type of urokinase produced; that is, the treated and control cultures produced plasminogen activators with the same molecular weights. DISCUSSION On the basis of five additional sensitive tests of cell function in vitro, it seems that Econazole at 1 kg/ml has a negligible effect, and its cytotoxic- ity at this concentration is sufficiently low to indicate that it is a safe antifungal agent for quantitative cell culture research. At 3 mg/ml, Wyler et al. Ill observed detectable inhibition of macrcmolecular synthesis; this is consistent with the observation (Fig. 1) that this concentration slightly slowed the growth rate of a permanent cell line. Nevertheless, it was reported that 3;.g/ml can counteract heavy \"ungal contamina- tion, and it seems that very minute cell damage accompanies treatment with this concentration. In suiastantial agreement with Wyler et al., we recommend use of Econazole at 1 Ng/ml as anti- fungal agent agent in cell culture systems. In I 2.van der Veen, J.; Bots. L.; Mm A.

Development and testing of electrophoresis solutions.. ,w a W + 1.1. Development of optimal buffer system. \"'85 _. 3 17 5Of the four types of buffers proposed for testing, two have been explored: low ionic strength electrophoresis buffer with and without density-gradient material. When the ability of cells to attach and spread was used as viability criterion it was found that the electro- phoresis routine was better tolerated when Ficoll was present. Table 1 shows the results of a viability study that began with a poor-viability population of primary human fetal kidney ,(HFK--1) cells at the first passage. Three cell lines have been utilized so far in various aspects of the project, including the other tasks (below). Human T-1 cells orig- inated from a biopsy of a kidney of an adolescent male in 1957 (1) and have been in continuous use in the project laboratory. Cell strain \"HFK\" (our designation) was obtained at first passage from Grand Island Biological Co. Aliquots were frozen at second passage, and it was propagated to the 13th passage. Cell strain \"HFK-1\" has been used in several experiments at the first and second passage. HFK consisted mainly of fibroblasts, and HFK-1 has a high epithelioid cell content. The chromosomes of HFK were examined, and the cells were found to be euploid. The stock medium for cell electrophoresis is described in Table 2. In this solution are dissolved density-gradient solutes such as sucrose and Ficoll to bring the osmolarity to 0.30. Its ionic strength is less than 0.01M, and its conductivity is usually 0.0011 mho/cm. (2). Methods for viability determination have included direct microscopic counting of the percent cells attached and spread within 24 hr of plating test cultures or electrophoretically separated fractions. In terms of the project objectives, this seems to be the most relevant test. The Cytograf viability assay concept has been tested, and Figure 1 shows, as expected that blue-stained cells scatter less light into the 0.8 - 3.30 angular interval than do unstained cells. Experiments are continuing using a HeNe laser with the Los Alamos flow cytophotometry system \"FMF II\" currently on loan from the Environmental Protection Agency. This apparatus permits optimization of the light-scatter detection angle so that stained cells will be maximally discriminated (3). y.2. Ionic strength tolerances. All cultured cells tested so far appear to be highly tolerant of the low (less than 0.01 M) ionic strength of electrophoresis buffers (see also Table 1). This finding is consistent with the experience of the ASTP MA-011 experimenters, who used \"A-1\" buffer with 0.0097 M ionic strength. It is presumed, therefore, that the full range of ionic (physiological) and 0.01 M is acceptable.lI-,. 1.3. Testing of viability at non-standard pH's. Studies have not yet been initiated on this aspect of the project, which will be important only if isoelectric focusing studies are contem- plated. 1.4. Optimum inorganic salt concentrations. Low I^Na seems to be acceptable as long as the osmolarity is maintained with neutral solges (glucose, sucrose, Ficoll). The standard buffer is 1.6 utM Na (Table 2) .compared to 8.1 mM used in the MA-011 buffer. However, our buffer contains 4. * 1e and^5 mM Mgt while the A-1 buffer contains only 0.37 * 1 K and no Mg Preliminary experiments indicate that EDTA is very toxic. TASK II. Optimization of freezing and thawing. II.I. Determination of optimum additive concentrations The use of 10% DMSO had always been satisfactory in out customary procedure (5). Strain HFK did not survive after thawing, anti the cells' morphology was clearly indicative of severe membrane damage. The method of trypsinizing is currently under investigation as an etiologic factor in low post-freezing viability. The optimization of trypsinization will be entered into the project before DMSO and glycerol concentration studies continue. 11.2. Determination of optimum freezing rate. Due to conditions just described, studies have not yet been initiated on this aspect of the project. TASK III. Procedure for evaluation of separated cells. III.1. Standard culture conditions. A 1-to-6 dilution of cells suspended in electrophoresis medium directly into growth medium (Eagle's BME + 10% fetal calf serum) in a 60 mm culture dish for each fraction has worked extremely well.. Cells of the strain HFK-1 do very well in \"maintenance medium\" consisting of Medium 149 plus 5% fetal calf serum. There is very little cell multi- plication, and cells are not 'Lost from the vessel surface. They attach readily in both media. Passing cultures of this strain at high density has resulted in a lack of fibroblast overgrowth and maintenance of epithelioid, granular morphology. Electrophoretic fractions of HFK and HFK-1 attach and spread within 1 hr after plating 1 ml cells suspended in low-ionic strength electrophoresis buffer into 4 ml of Eagle's BME + 10% fetal calf serum. The use of 15% serum was not found to improve: the viability of cells plated from frozen stocks.3 t 4^ S.+ai\u2014J TASK 1. Development and testing of electrophoresis solutions. The testing of buffers and media continued, using additional new t human kidney cell explancs obtained from Microbiological Associates, Inc. These were designated HFK-6 through HFK-9. The earlier source, Grand Island Biological Company, is no longer supplying human kidney cells. Durinb this 6-month reporting period a problem requiring additional research arose, Fetal calf serum became scarce then essentially un- availaole. Alternatives tested for the growth of HFK-7 and HFK-8 cells included Calf serum, newborn calf serum, calf serum, \"bobby\" calf serum, and bovine (adult:) serum. No qualitative differences were ouserved between cultures of these cells grown in fetal and newborn calf sera at 10% concentration in Eagle's BME. If anything, newborn was ae.tter (EXP 1064). A more quantitative evaluation was-made using our colony- forming human cell line T-1E, which shares phenotypic properties with HeLa cells. It was found (EXP 1069) that plating efficiencies were not significantly different whether fetal, newborn, calf, or bovine sera were used at 10% concentration and that growth curves in fetal and newborn sera were indistinguishable. Experimentation therefore con- tinued using newborn calf serum on a routine basis. Comparisons between PBG and A-1 buffers continued at various stages of cell preparation and electrophoresis. The formulae for these solutions were given in the previous progress report. Emphasis was placed on the effect of spendin6 4 hr at 4\u00b0C in the two buffers containing DMSO or glycerol on the cells' ability to attach and spread in culture and to form confluent monolayers-. The regular culture medium \"BME-10\" was used as control standard. -.The effects of 5% DMSO or glycerol were compared in complete medium, and it was found (EXP 1036) that without freezing DMSO produced denser cultures than glycerol in 72 hr, and the cultures in the two solutions were comparable after 96 hr. Supernatants contained cells that later attached in both cases, and cells from both treatments ultimately produced confluent sheets. When 5% glycerol was used in A-1 or PBG buffers (EXP 1037) for storage at 40C for 4 hr it was found that A-1 plus glycerol led ^o slightly higher viability than PBG plus glycerol, as shown in Table 1. It is concluded that, if cells are not to be frozen, A-1 buffer is slightly better. However, see below under \"freezing\" task. Another step in the procedure was examined, namely the use of EDTA or scraping in place of trypsinizing to prepare cells for electrophoresis. Although neither procedure was as gentle as our usual, trypsinization it was clear that incubation of monolayers in in Puck's Saline A (PSA), *ihich produced 48% attached and flat cells in 24 hr was superior to scraping cells in PSA and no EDTA, which produced less than 20% cells attached and spread in 24 hr (EXP 1062), Due to an earlier decision to try to avoid trypsinization in future electrophoresis runs, cell dispersal for electrophoresis is now being done with 0.37% EDTA in PSA. Monolayers are incubated 10 min in this solution, and suspending fluid is added to dilute the EDTA. z10-4 W TASK II. Optimization of freezing and thawing. It was previously reported that freezing and thawing of HFK cell suspensions resulted in large numbers of non-adherent but apparently viable cells. These cells were subjected to further study, and no evidence could be found that they are capable of proliferation (EXP 1024). Attempts to evaluate their DNA content by laser flow cyto- fluorometry failed when it was found that the 4N HC1 used in Feulgen hydrolysis destroyed these cells (EXP 1027, 1039). It is tentatively concluded that these are dead cells whose unattached carcasses do not readily lyse or otherwise disappear from cultures. Cells with this peculiar behavior have not been found in large numbers in recent explants. Glycerol and DMSO (5%) were compared as freezing agents in complete medium (EXP 1036). Cells frozen 18 days in liquid nitrogen attached more quickly after thawing in-glycerol than in DMSO. On the second and third days, however, the cultures were indistinguishable. When 5% glycerol was used in A-1 or PSB and cells were frozen 2 days, the results shown in Table 2 (EXP 1037) were obtained, and it was concluded that PSB is superior to A-1 when cells are frozen in glycerol, despite the above finding that cells in A-1 buffer survive better when freezing is not part of the procedure. The effect of incubation time after thawing and before adding medium was investigated. By allowing cells Lo attach 1 hr and removing medium and replating the supernatant while changing medium on the attached cells, it was possible to conclude that 75% of the cells (HFK-6) attach in the first 2 hr after thawing and that they tolerate the residual DMSO i (diluted to about 0.8%) for this 2-hr period (EXP 1083). In a combined 3-day freezing test of glycerol vs. DMSO and A-1 vs. PBG it was found, as indicated in Table 3 (EXP 1069) that combining glycerol and DMSO was very bad for the cells, otherwise glycerol and DMSO were about the same in A-1 buffer, but in this particular test glycerol appeared to be better than DMSO in PBG; however, the fraction of cells that also spread in 24 hr was actually greater in DTASO-- 28% vs. 13%. Cells spread more slowly yet (10-12% in 24 hr) in the A-1 buffer solutions. The results of freezing and thawin6 experiments to date slightly favor the use of 5% DMSO in PBG, but it is also evident that 5% glycerol in A-1 is really not very different. It seems that 50-60% viability (in terms of cell attachment in culture) is to be expected under several of the conditions tested. The present data do not give very strong reasons for making recommendations of any particular combination of buffer and freezing agent. i ow10-5 ^f Table 1.

Elaine Runze, Vincent Giranda Althouse Laboratory, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802 J.N. Mehrishi Department of Medicine, Addenbrookes Hospital, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England CB2 2QQ Introduction One of the promises of preparative cell electrophoresis is its sability to purify functioning, living animal cells in useful 4 quantities. One of several such methods is density-gradient electrophoresis. When a low-ionic-strength, isotonic gradient of Ficoll and sucrose is used in a glass column at 4 0C, the physical factors that determine the upward velocity of cells Vcombine to produce a nearly-constant migration rate. Density- i.,. 1gradient electrophoresis has been applied to suspended cells prepared from freshly dispersed tissues, cultured-cell mono- layers, and naturally suspended cells from body fluids (1, 2, 3, 4). It is the purpose of this report to briefly describe !recent work performed at the Pennsylvania State University con-. sisting of further physical characterization of density- gradient electrophoresis and the results of a small number of recent applications to living cells. The most popular uses of preparative cell electrophoresis have been in the field of immunology, and this is true of density-gradient electrophor- esis (4, 5), Some rather more unusual applications will be discussed here. All of the research reported here used the O 1981 Walter de Gruyter & Co,, Berlin New York described by Soltz et al.(6). Columns - without a central cooling finger were used. Electrophoretic Cell Migration in a Ficoll Gradient As cells migrate upward through a decreasing Ficoll concentra- tion in the electrophoresis column they encounter changes in viscosity, density, and conductivity. In addition, Ficoll it- self affects electrophoretic mobility (1, 6, 7). The effect of Ficoll was determined quantitatively by the microscopic method of cell electrophoresis using the-Zeiss cytopherometer .and determination of mobilities para- bolas corrected for asymmetric electroosmotic backflow (Z, 8). A linear increase of the mobilities of various erythrocytes with increasing Ficoll concentration was found. From the remaining known and measured properties of the cells and solu- tions (9) it is possible to predict the upward migration velo- city of cells under the influence of the combined forces of gravity and the applied electric field. The resulting mathe- matical relationship, when integrated numerically, produces a migration plot (distances vs. time) such as that shown in Fig- ure 1. Because migration velocity depends slightly, but roughly linearly, upon migration distance, an exponential, func- tion is expected, but, as Figure 1 indicates, this is a slowly rising exponential function which is indistinguishable from a straight line within the accuracy of most distance measure- ments. The electrophoretic mobility, p, normally defined as migration velocity per unit field strength in pm-cm/V-sec, was therefore determined in these studies by dividing the distance migrated by the electrophoresis time and dividing this ratio by the constant field strength.l11-k U WUZ4HN 0 z0 c^ 28 RAT R8C I = 20 mA T = 4.0\u00b0C 7 0 = 2 -8% FICOLL 6 4 3 2PP^ i L qL 0 60 120 180 240 300 360 Figure 1.

Below the break shown near the middle of the curve the numerical integratioriis approximated satisfac- torily by an exponential function resulting from the assumption that cell velocity depends linearly,\u00b0 on migration distance.. Effect of Cell Cycle Phase on Electrophoretic Mobility Cells from a long-term cultured epithelial line designated \"T-1\" (10, 11) were cultured in monclayers in plastic flasks and suspended in electrophoresis buffer by detachment with - subjecting the suspended cells to-density--gradient electrophoresis, fractions were collected, and the DNA content of individual cells was measured by flow cytome'try using the staining method of Trujillo et al. (12) and flow cytometry with a Bic/Physics Systems, Inc. Cytofluorograf (13). The cellular DNA distribution of individual fractions revealed that low- mobility fractions were enriched in cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle (Figure 2). However, the mobility distributions of cells in different phases of the cycle are broad (14), and the data of Figure 2 reveal only, as found by Forrester (14), that there is a general trend toward lower mobilities as cells progress through the cycle. Figure 2.0 10 20 30 PG DNA /CELL Cellular DNA distributions of cultured human T-1 cells in fractions collected after density-gradient electrophoresis. DNA content per cell was cali- brated biochemically (15). Higher mobility frac- tions were depleted, while lower mobility fractions were enriched, with respect to cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. -t a i11-F _ Urokinase-producing Cells in Human Embryonic Kidney Cell --- Cultures Human urokinase, a plasminogen activator produced in the kid- ney, is being considered as a therapeutic agent for thrombosis (16). Electrophoretically purified cultured human embryonic kidney cells are considered a potentially efficient source of this material (17), and electrophoretic purification attempts have been reported (18). Cells from early-passage culture, designated \"HFK-18\", were propagated in monolayers in plastic flasks and suspended in electrophoresis buffer by detachment :y with EDTA. After subjecting the suspend.e7d cells to density- gradient electrophoresis, fractions were collected and cultured in complete medium. Just before these cultures became conflu- ent the complete medium was replaced by a high- glycine, incomp- lete medium into which urokinase-producing cells secreted their product. Urokinase activity was measured in CTA units by a calibrated fibrin-plate method (19' every 3-4 days after this medium change. Figure 3 indicates that most electrophoretic fractions contain cells that produce urokinase and, in this particular culture, the highest mobility fractions produced the highest levels of urokinase activity per cell.I r I.f Freshly Dispersed Lymphocytes from the Irradiated Mouse Spleen '4. :f E VRadiation therapy often leads to lymphopenia in treated can.ce-- patients (20). it had previously been found that lymphocyte population changes in thymus lymphocytes of irradiated mice could be followed by analytical electrophoresis as a function of time after irradiation and that a clear rise and fall of the proportion of high-mobility (presumably cortical) calls occurs (21).

Suspended Somatotrophin-producing Cells from the Rat Anterior Pituitary Purified populations of live somatotrcphin-producing cells have numerous potential applications, including implantation for growth enhancement (24), production of mRNAs for gene cloning, investigation of single-cell responses to releasing agents (25), the study of other functions of somatotrophs (26), and hormone production in vitro (2 71). Preparative cell electro- phoresis is one of the methods that is potentially applicable to this particular cell purification problem.

Cells in band II were enriched somatotrophs. The electrophoretic mobility distribution of these partially purified cells was determined by density- gradient electrophoresis. At the same time electrophoretic fractions were collected and assayed for growth hormone content so that specific mobilities could be associated with specific levels of hormone production per cell. Two electrophoresis columns were used to simultaneously separate cells in centri- fugal bands I and II. The separation profiles (Figure 5) reveal obvious differences in the mobility distributions between bands I and II. Radioimmunoassay of pooled fractions of cells from this separation experiment showed that the specific activity of cells from band 4 (lowest mobility group) in the upper panel. of Figure 5 was 872 rg of growth hormone per 1000 cells, whereas pooled fractions represented by bands 1, 2, and 3 had 300 + 50 ng/1000 cells. Cells from all fractions from column II (lower panel of Figure 5) had only 30 ng/1000 cells. These data suggest that a small pool of somatotrophs that contain relatively large quantities of hormone can be separated from other cell types on the basis of their low electrophoretic mobility. Discussion and Summary-^x (^ f 7The fact that cell migration in Ficoll density-gradient elec - trophesis is nearly linear allows meaningful separations and analyses to be performed by density-gradient electrophoresis. In specific research projects it was found that the electro- phoretic mobility of logarithmically growing cells from a long- term cultured human cell line depends on cell cycle phase. Preparative electrophoresis males this experiment possible in the absence of artificial synchronization of the cells. Elec- trophoretic subpopulations of cells from human embryonic kidney t.: '04.\" x i,l1X-1^ are enriched in cells produce activator used in thrombolytic phoresis concentrates larger numbers of these senescing cells than could be done by the selection of single clones. Electro- phoretic separation of freshly dispersed lymphocytes from the irradiated mouse spleen indicates a preferential loss of low- - mobility (\"non-T\") cells. Freshly dispersed cells from the rat anterior pituitary have a low-mobility subpopulation that is rich in somatotrophs that contain growth hormone after electro- phoretic purification. Preparative electrophoresis permits the post-separation use of functional assays to unequivocally iden- tify classes of cells having known electrophoretic mobilities. These research examples also indicate the utility of prepara- tive electrophoresis, especially including density-gradient electrophoresis, in producing populations of functioning cells for further study or use in the production of cell products.

Chapter 12, IN VARIOUS BUFFERS L. D. Plank, M. E. Kunze, and P. Todd N85-31 INTRODUCTION 75(;r.'S The calibration of space flight equipment has grown to depend upon a source of standard test particles, and the test particle of choice has become the fixed erythrocyte. Erythrocytes from different species have different electrophoretic mobilities. Most buffers used in space electrophoresis applicatons have low conductivity and hence low ionic strength. Electrophoretic mobility depends upon zeta potential, which, in turn depends upon ionic strenth. Zeta potential decreases with increasing ionic strength, so cells have high electrophoretic mobility in space electrophoresis buffers than in typical \"physiological\" buffers, which have ionic strength = 0.145 g-ions/1. Therefore, a series of experiments was conducted to characterize the electrophoretic mobilities of fixed human, rat, and rabbit erythrocytes in 0.145 M salt, the standard experimental condition, and buffers of varying ionic strength, temperature, and composition, in order to assess the effects of some of the unique combinations used in space buffers. Several effects had to be assessed: glycerol or DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide) were under consideration for use as cryoprotectants. The effect of these substances, if any, on erythrocyte electrophoretic mobility was therefore important to know. The choice of buffer partly depended upon cell mobility (owing to operating constraints of the EEVT apparatus). Primary experiments with kidney cells established the choice of buffer and cryoprotectant. A non-standtard temperature was anticipated in the EEVT experiment, so the temparture dependence of EPM in the suitable buffer had to be determined. Since there was a loss of ionic strength control in the course of preparing columns for flight, the efffects of small increases in ionic strength over the expected low values were also in need of evaluation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Approximately 10 different buffers were used in EPM measurements that were performed over the 6-year project period. Most of these are described, with respect to composition, ionic strength, conductivity, and osmolari.ty, in Table 1. In addition, the buffer designated \"C-2\", one of the glucose-sucrose Boltz buffers originally developed for density gradient electrophoresis, is described in Table 2. Rat erythrocytes were collected by cardiac puncture or exsanguination after cervical dislocation. For fixation they were collected into 0.067 M Ssorensen's buffer and fixed in formaldehyde by Seaman's method or in glutaraldehyde by Tenforde and Glaeser's method. Human and rabbit blood were collected by venipuncture and fixed in the same way. Measurements of EPM were performed using the Zeiss \"Cytopherometer\" with a rectangular chamber and Cam--Apparatus electrodes or with the \"Pen Kem 3000\" automated electrokinetic analyser. In the former case, cells at all depths through the chamber were clocked (by hand), and the resulting data were recorded on a DEC PDP-11 or Zenith 2100 miocrocumpter for fitting of assymetric parabolas and analysing them into histograms of cell count vs. mobility, using the BASIC RT-11 programs developed by L. D. Plank on the basis of the work of R A. Gaines (Chapter 4).V 12-2 RESULTS During the 1980-1982 calendar years numerous EPM measurements were mmade Jon fixed human erythrocytes; the raw list of resulting mobilities is given in ('''.;table 3'. The other standard particle chosen of use on E\u00a3VT was fixed rabbit erythrocytes, which have about 0.55 the mobility of human erythrocytes, although the literature values tend to vary by about 15% around this ratio. Table 4 is as raw list of rabbit erythrocyte mobilities. From these two tables it was possible to derive the final mobility values most relevant to the EEVT experiment; these are the human and rabbit erythrocyte mobilities in buffer D-1, finally chosen for the flight experiment, and 0.145 M NaCl in bicarbonate buffer, the standard buffer for erythrocyte electrokinetic mauseruemts. These measurements are summarized in Tables 5 and 6. All values are corrected of the viscosity of water at 25 degrees C. During the final months before flight an invonsistency arose concerning the EPM of the cells fixed by G. V. F. Seaman to be used as the flight standards. Measurements at McDonnel-Douglas Astronaoutics Corp. (MDAC) yielded unexpectedly high mobilities, and measurements at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) yielded unexpectdely low mobilities. These discrepancies were resolved when it was found that the MDAC samples had become contaminated, and they also had high mobilities when measured at the Pennsylvania State Universtiy (PSU) (Table 3, lines 1 and 2), and when the same viscosity corrections were applied to data obtained at MSFC (Figure 1) and PSU (Tables 3 and 4) the mobiliteis and standard deviations were essentially the same. Thus, the ACTUAL mobilities agreed upon, that would apply in D-1 buffer at 25 degress, are those seen in Figure 1, prepared by Dr. R. S. Snyder of MSFC, using Rank Bros. electrophoresis microscope with circular chamber. The several questions that arose in the ccurse of this study were answered as follows: 1.Cells that were studied at MDAC had higher mobility, especially those that had been stored in D-1 buffer at MSFC. 2.Mobility in D-1 is consistently higher than in A-1, but only bo 0.1 - 0.2 unit. 3.Mobililties measured in saline in all laboratories are correct. 4.The lowest mobilities meeasured were 2.31 and 2.35; these were made in D-1 without DMSO, in the Cytopherometer and Pen Kem, respectively. 5.Using higher current did not increase mobility. 6.The range of reliable mobilities (3/82) of formalin-fixed human erythrocytes is 2.54 - 2.79. 7.Deriving mobililties from whole velocity parabolas does not increase measured mobility. If anything, parabola mobilities are about 0.1 - 0.2 unit less that mobilities derived from stationary-plan-only measurements. 8.Glutaraldehyde-fixed cells do not have higher mobility than formalin- fixed cells. Another method used in the course of the electrophoresis, using the same fixed cells a could be related to the microgravity studies, were also made in C-1 buffer (Table 3 and 4) 3000 Automated Electrokinetic analyser, using erythrocytes rather than human (Figure 2).research was density gradient s standards. So that this work absolute mobility measurements and verified using the Pen Kam glutaraldehyde fixed rat -.} not 1 heConductivity and temperature of the column buffers in the EEVT were exactly as planned, so post-flight analysis depended upon understanding i12.3 effects of changing the concentration (and hence ionic strength, conductivity, viscosity, etc.) of D-1 buffer. The dependence of mobility on ionic strength is well known (Heard and Seaman, 1960). The buffers used in evaluating the ionic strength dependence of REC mobility using the Cytopherometer are listed in table 7, and a graph of EPM vs. ionic strength is given as Figure 4. An example of the study of the effect of temperature using the Cytopherometer is given in Figure 5, in which complete velocity parabolas are presented at two temperatures in D-1 buffer. A series of such experiments was conducted and the final results are presented in Table 8, where EPM as a function of both temperature and buffer concentration is given. Table 2.

D. Plank, M. E. Kunze and P. ToddOOF {j ,I r-^INTRODUCTION A variety of proteolytic and mucolytic enzymes, mechanical procedures, ^ iand changes in the ionic environment, especially Ca++ chelation, have been routinely used for dispersal of monolayer-grown cells. If either chelating agens or mechanical dispersion are used alone, the cell yield is often low and suspensions of single cells are difficult to obtain. Confluent monolayers treated with EDTA tend to be released from their surfaces in sheets, and ^-.lumpts of cells remain even after further incubation in EDTA (Snow and Allen, F 1967). Crude trypsin is the most popular dispersal agent and is known to contain a variety of contaminating enzymes (Rinaldini, 1958; Waymouth, 1974; Pine et al., 1969) which may contribute in many cases to the dispersal of cells (Pine et al., 1969). Reports of a variety of cell injuries resulting from the activity of proteolytic enzymes have appeared. These include adverse effects on cellular metabolism and viability (Berry et Al., Gunther et al., Hebb and Chu, Weiss, 1958; Malucci, Konigsberg, Edwards, et al., Kellner et al.) as well as specific injury to the cell surf ace (Seaifect.a, Lehmkuhlod, Haltzer et al.) Snow and Allen ( ) have reported the release of macromolecules containing bound amino sugars from cells in tissue culture after harvesting with crude trypsin, Crystalline trypsin, and EDTA. Further, crystalline trypsin was shown to be least harmful to cell integrity as judged by trypan blue uptake. There is considerable evidence that both crude trypsin and crystalline trypsin treatment removes surface sialogly cop eptides from monolayer grown (Snow and Ginsburg, 1969; Vogel, ascites and Ambrose, 1964, Gasic and Gasic, 1962 a and b, w Codington, 1970) and human (Cook et al., 1960) and beef erythrocytes (Walter et al.., 1972). It is noteworthy that Cook et al., 1962) found no release of 0 -.r '13--1 i^c ^r ^ri i .^I ttI sialic acids from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells after treatment with crude 4 trypsin. EDTA treatment, however, does not release surface sialic acids from cells in tissue culture (Snow and Alen, 1970; Vogel, 1978) but is expected to remove calcium from the cell periphery (Weiss, 1967) (Bo yle, 1966). Crude trypsin preparations from different sources are know to vary markedly in their compsoition with regard to contaminating enzyme activities (Speicher, 1977). A number of studies have investigated the effects of proteolytic enzymes and chelating agents on the e.p.m. of and Forrester, 1967; Ponder, 1951; Seaman and Heard, 1960; Thompson et al., 1978; Thompson 1977; Molito 1977; Weiss 1966; Woo and Cater, 1972). Crystalline trypsin has been shown to reduce the e.p.m. of human red blood cells by approximately 30% when measured in physiological saline (Seaman and Uhlenbruck, 1962, 1963; .Ponder, 1951). Appreciable reduction in e.p.m. has also been observed in chimpanzee and dog erythrocytes whereas those of hose, ox, pig and sheep exhibited small decrements or no change (Seaman and Uhlenbruch, 1962, 1963). In the case of monolayer cultures, adequate controls are difficult to achieve. Adherent cell types which also grow in suspension have been investigated by Brent and Forrester (1967) and by Fike and van Oss (1976). The former group concluded that EDTA dispersal of Hela cells probably does not affect the e .p.m. when measured at physiological ionic strength. Likewise, no significant change in the e .p.m. of kPMI 1846 cells after EDTA treatment was observed by Fike and van Oss (1976). These authors reported that crude trypsin, however, caused a significant increase in zeta potential and identical mobilities were reported for the treated suspension cells and for the trypsin 4i 13-3 ;j dispersed monolayer cells. A low ionic strength buffer (0.015 g.ions/1) was used in this work. The effects of trypsin and EDTA dispersal on the e.p.m. of anchorage--dependent cells have generally been considered in comparison with a mechanical dispersal technique. Hayry et al. (1965) reported that the e.p.m. of Hela cells in physiological saline was reduced significantly after disaggregation with trypsin when compared with the mobility of mechanically dispersed cells which was similar to that obtained by EDTA dispersal. Simon-Reuss (1964) also compared the effects of scraping and crude trypsin dispersal or. a variety of primary and continuous cell types. Mobility measurements in standard sulir-e could not detect any significant differences between the two treatments. A novel approach was adopted by Fike and Van Oss (1976) who determined the zeta-potential of intact cell monlayers by measuring the electro-osmotic flow velocity in their capillary chamber on the inner surface of which a confluent layer of cells was present. Their results indicated that both EDTA and mechanical scraping caused no significant change in zeta potential but that trypsin dispersal resulted in an aprpe.ciable decrease in the two cell types examined. In the present work, the effects on zeta potential of EDTA dissociation of monolayer cultures was compared with the effects of detachment F77 exposure to hypotonic medium followed by mechanical agitation. Gaffney and McElwain (19) had used brie\u00a3e expooure to hypotonic salt solution to selectively detach mitotic cells from inonolayers. In our lab, all cultures were routinely 6ubcultivated approximately 24 hours prior to harvesting so that subconfluent monolayers only were dispersed. This protocol enabled single cell suspensions to be obtained by EDTA treatment. In all the adherent cell cyptes examined crude trypsin dispersal resulted in signficantly decreased zeta potentials whenC 4, k13-4 compared with dis persal by EDTA. This was true for low and intermediate values of buffer ionic strength as well as or physiological saline. Identical value, of e.p.mo were invariably obtained after harvesting by trypsin Compared with '-ry psin-EDTA. Two lines of evidence thus show that trypsin, not EDTA, modifies the charge composition of the cell periphery. In chinese hamster cell lines, the hyptonic medium removal method resulted in lower e.p.m. than that obtained for EDTA dispersal. Trypsan blue viability measurements indicated that the former method was more damaging to cellular integrity. EDTA and hypotonic medium dissociation of T-1E cells, however, resulted i.n similar mobility readings. After maintenance in spinner culture, following trypsin dispersal the e.p.m. was significantly higher than that of the EDTA dispersed cel!.s. The effect of EDTA treatment on the spinner-maintained cells has not been investigated. Measurements ofe.p.m%provide an indixeof net surface charge density at f the hydrodynamic slipplaneof a cell (Briton and Lauffer, 1958). All studies of date have shown that th_ vertebrate cell surface exhibits a neagative seta potential. groups ha-e been imp\".icated as an important determinant of this negative chars;e in many cell types (Seaman and Heard, 1960; Cook, Heard and Seaman, 1961; Wallach and Eyler, 1961; Forrester, Ambrose and MacPherson, 1962). The contribution from other anionic groups in the cell periphery will vary according to cell type and conditions of measurement. \"The further away from the electrokinetic surface of a call an ionized group is, the less will be its projected contribution at the plane of the zeta potential.\" Lowering the ionic strength of the buffer in whi,,h electrophoretic mobility determinations are made results in extension of the Debyi shielding distance which means that the net surface charge density measured is avenged over a greater depth of the cell periphery (Seaman and Heart, 19610. f13-5 After incubation with trypsin--EDTA, the e.p.m. of the mouse lymphoma cells at intermediate ionic strength (0.03) was significantly higher than that of r untreated cells. EDTA treatment had no appreciable effect on the e.p.m. of i control cells. Weiss (1967) has remarked that this latter result could indicate that either the majority of the chelated calcium is bound to anioni,- groups in the glycocalyz whicha re appreciably deeper than 20A from the hydrodynamic shear plane, or univalent cations readily mask any superficial anionic sites revealed by calcium removal. Woo and Cater (1972) demonstrated that incubation of hepatoma ascites cells with trypsin resulted in a 22% reduction of mobility. Weiss 91966) found, however, no significant change in the mobility of marine sacroma 37 ascites cells after incubation with crystalline trypsin. Both these studies used physiological ionic strength buffers. Weiss (1967) has also observed the effect of EDT, incubation on the mobility of murine sarcoma cells and found no detectable change. This study was undertaken to assess the effects of trypsin and EDTA dissociation on cellular electrophoretic mobility and viability in vidw of the importance of maintaining cell integrity and electrophoretic heterogeneity for preparative electrophoresis experiments. Primary human embryonic kidney cultures used in this work possess morphologically distinguishable subpopulations which may well be separable electrohoretically; as has been achieved for rabbit kidney cortex cells by Heidrich and Dew (1977) and Vandewalle et a1. (1982). Although no consistent reduction in electrophoretic heterogeneity following trypsin treatment as compared with other treatments was observed in the present work, the greater surface charge alterations seen following tr ypsin dispersal could yet be detrimental to separation. The variability of different trypsin batches in enzyme composition and activity (Speicher) also may affect reproducibility of a separation protocol based oni v13-6 surface charge differences. The apparently less severe effect of EDTA ^. dispersal on the electrokinetic surface needs to be considered along with the reduced viability sometimes seen following this treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS The electrophoresis buffer composition is given in Table 1. Cells were removed from subconfluent cultures by incubation in 0.37 EDTA in Fuck's saline A (composition given in Table 2) or the same solution with 0.03% crude trypsin added. Cells were centrifuged out of these sQiutions and washed and resuspended in D-1 buffer for electroporesis. The Zeiss Cytopherometer with Cam\u2014Apparatus electrodes was used to obtain mobility hisotgrams from the analysis of the complete cell flow parabola. RESULTS A parabola giving cell velocity vs. chambe_- depth is shown in Fig. 1., and the mobility histograms are shown in Fig. 2. Due to the small number of cells available for measurement in the chamber there is no statistically significant difference between the histogram obtained with cells dispersed with trypsin and EDTA and that for cells dispersed with EDTA only. In any case, trypsin treatment did not reduce the electrophoretic mobilities. The combination of cell dispersal with EDTA and suspensions in 0-1 buffer still does not lead to fully satisfactory viability. Table k summarizes the results of a preliminary experiment designed to test the ability of D-1 buffer on its own to disperse cells. This experiments was based on a recently announced finding that DMSO at 10% concentration disaggregates actin\u2014containing mi crof ilaments in epithelioid cells in culture. The results indicate that t?-1 1 buffer does disperse cells, but that it might selectively suspend cells with a ^y _13:7 low viabiity, since the traditional method employing EDTA in Puck's saline A led to much higher viability, as measured by percent attachment in 24 hours. Variant of this experiment are to be performed in the near future.. Table 1.

E. Kunze, P. Todd, C. Goolsby, and J. T. Walker 3 1758 ABSTRACT Human epithelicid T-lE cells were cultured in suspension and subjected to density gradient electrophoresis upward in a vertical column. Three lines of evidence indicated that the most rapidly migrating cells were at the beginning of the cell cycle and the most' slowly migrating cells were at the end of the cell cycle. The most rapidly migrating cells divided 24 hr later than the most slowly migrating cells. Colonies developing from slowly migrating cells had twice as many cells during exponential growth as did the most rapidly migrating cells, and the numbers of cells per colony at any time was inversely related to the electrophoretic migration rate. DNA, measure- ments by fluorescence flow cytometry indicated that the most slowly migrating cell-populations were enriched in cells that had twice as much DNA as the most rapidly migrating cells. It is concluded that electrophoretic mobility of these cultured human cells declines steadily through the cell cycle and that the mobility is lowest at the end of G 2 phase and highest at the beginning of Gl phase. INTRODUCTION Changes in cell share (1;, surface interactions (2), and surface composition (3) through the cell cycle imply that significant cell surface modifications occur. Presumably some aspects of these surface modifications are manifested in the farm of surface charge density changes that are detectable by:cell electrophoresis. The electrophoresis of synchronized cells requires large numbers of narrowly-synchronous cells in suspension with undamaged surfaces. Such cell populations are extremely difficultur V 14-2 L to obtain. An early attempt at synchronous cell electrophoresis was made by Brent and Forrester (4) who collected mitotieally detached HeLa cells ^r from mitotically-enriched (5) populations in monoiayer culture. The mi.totically-collected cells had a much higher electrophoretie mobility (EPM) than did asynchronous cells growing in suspension (see Table 1). Subsequent cultivation of asynchronous cells in suspension led to a de- crease in EPM, which rose again at the time of the next synchronous mitosis. These experiments were performed by microscopic electrophoresis at ionic strength approximately 0.16 M. Nearly all ether experiments on the EPM of synchronous cells have been performed using suspension-grown cells. Mayhew and O'Grady partially synchronized RPMI 41 ..sarcoma cells by double thymidine block and measured EPM as a function of time. A mitotic pdak occurred 14-17 hr (15% mitotic cells) after thymidine release, and at this time EPM was highest, about -1.3 gm-cm/V-sec (see Table 1). During DNA synthesis cells had mobilities similar to or lower than asynchronous cells. After cell division the mobility fell sharply (6,7) and appeared to rise again around G2 or the next mitosis. Neuraminidase-treatment of double-thymidine and cold-shock synchronized cells eliminated the cyclic variation of EPM (7). Shank and Burki (8) reported that the EPM of Lo178Y mouse lymphoma cells synchronized in suspension by sequential thymidine and colcemic blockades did not change through the cell cycle (see Table 1). They suggested that cells that are normally non-adherent have no need to change surface features through the cell cycle, so EPM may also be expected to remain constant. However, Gersten and Bosmann (9) studied the same cells with the same synchronizing procedure but measured EPM at much lower ionic strength and found that EPM fell from a maximum of -2.0 during G 1 phase to a constant value of about -1.7 during S phase and rose again at the next cell division. 1\"WT6W- -^A, yl14L'. Despite rather substantial differences in the cell systems studied to date, it is possible to discern a mild concensus in the findings. RPM is highest at one or both ends of the cell cycle. By examining the published data it can be seen that RPM is definitely high at the very beginning of the cell cycle (early G 1), but it is less certain that EPM is high at the end of the cycle, sinceall experiments reported to date report measurements made after considerable desynchronization and hence in the presence of early G I cells. All cell synchronizations were also accomplished by the use of abnormal metabolic conditions, such as excess thymidine S-phase blockade, colcemi.d M-phase blockade, and cold shock. In view of the above state of affairs and our own research objectives, the study of radiation effects on EPM, a series of experiments was under- taken to determine whether human T-1E cells experienced modulation of EPM throgh the cell cycle, whether cyclic changes in EPM occur in the absence of metabolic synchronization, and, if so, whether EPM is high at both or only one end of the cell cycle. To achieve these objectives, asynchronous. T-1E cells were grown in suspension without metabolic synchronization and subjected to preparative density gradient electrophoresis, subsequent to which individual electrophoretic subpopulations of cells were subjected to DNA distribution analysis by fluorescence flow cytometry.or growth analysis to determine position in the cycle following electrophoresis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Human T-lE cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium according to routines previously described (10). In preparation for experiments, suspensions were prepared using 0.03% crude trypsin in Puck's Saline A, and cells were diluted to 3 x 105/ml in complete medium and transferred to spinner flasks for cultivation in14-4 i- 24 hr. These asynchronous cells were centrifuged out of the complete medium and resuspended in electrophoresis buffer (11) for electrophoretic ^r , separation at low (0.030 !) ionic strength in a Ficoll gradient (11). After electrophoresis for approximately 2.5 hr at 19 mA, cells were collected, usually under sterile conditions, :.n fractions pumped out the top of the column. In some instances cells were then cultured in monolayers for growth or colony formation measurements, and in some in- stances cells were fixed and stained for flow cytometry (12). Growth curves were determined by periodic counting of the number of cells in each of about 100 colonies by phase contrast microscopy as a function of time after plating cells in 60 mm culture dishes, as previously described (13). RESULTS ' When human T-13 cells were subjected to density gradient electro- phoresis and collected in 3-drop fractions (high resolution) the Celectrophoresic profile given in Figure 1 was found. The circles indicate the number of visible colonies forme,' in each culture prepared from the individual fractions by collecting three drops of column effluent directly in 60 mm culture dishes with 5.0 ml of complete medium. The plotted dots represent the ratio of colonies formed to cells per unit area in the starting culture prepared from each fraction. The electrop.horetic profile is a broad double- or triple-peaked distribution, but there is not clear trend in plating efficiency vs. fraction number. When selected fractions were examined microscopically for the determination of average number of cells per colony it was found that the rapidly migrating fractions (40-50) had fewer cells per colony than did slowly migrating fractions (60-68) during logarithmic phase growth (65.5 hr after plating). Furthermore, the number of cells per colony at this stage increased with fraction number in a regular171;-55 fashion between fractions 50 and 60. In other words, more slowly migrating cells gave rise to larger colonies. These results are seen in Figure 2. The slowly-migrating cells could give rise to more rapidly growing colonies or colonies that enter -logarithmic growth sooner. The complete growth curves of selected fractions, given in Figure 3, indicate that the growth rates do not differ significantly, but the growth curve of the most slowly migrating fraction (dots) leads the growth curve of the most rapidly migrating. fraction (circles) by as much as 18 hr. The more accurate growth curves from a lower-resolution electrophoresis experiment, given in Figure 4, confirm this finding. Cells from slowly- migrating fractions multiply sooner, but not faster, than cells from rapidly- migrating electrophoretic fractions. Growth curves of asyicchronous T-lE cells determined by counting cells per colony can be analysed to show that large colonies correspond to cells plated in the later part of the cycle (G 2 phase, for example), and small colonies correspond to cells plated in the G l phase. Thus Figure 5 shows that the growth curve for the 207. largest colonies in a population starts with a delay of 0-2 hr, and the growth curve for the 207. smallest colonies in a population starts with a delay of 19-23 hr (about one cycle time). The smallest colonies started growth with a division delay of about 1 cycle, implying that they had to pass through nearly a full cycle before dividing. It is deduced from this type of analysis that, in normal cultures, large colonies correspond to single cells plated in G 2 phase, and small colonies correspond to cells plated in early G1 phase. This principle was applied to growth curves of cells from specific fractions dist.ribu:Ced throughout the high-resolution eleet.rophoretic 1 profile shown in Figure 6, and it can be seen in Figure 7 that the most _.14-6 rapidly migrating cells were the last to divide (fraction 15), while the most slowly migrating cells divided first (fraction 33). In a similar series of experiments growth curves were determined with greater time resolution during the first two cell cycles after electrophoresis, and Figure 8 shows that evidence for synchronous waves of division exist and that they occur at different times in cells from different_eleetrophoretic fractions; in slowly migrating fractions they occur before they do in rapidly migrating fractions. When collected fractions were subjected to DNA analysis by flow cytometry it was found that rapidly migrating fractions (high apparent mobility fractions in Figure 9) were nearly devoid of G 2 cells and very low in S cells, but slowly-migrating fractions (0.5 - 0.6 apparent mobility units in Figure 9) were enriched in G 2 cells. These differences are seen more clearly in Figure 10, in which fractions 16 (high mobility) and 22 (low mobility) are compared on the same scale. To determine whether or not this finding of electrophoresic enrich- ment of cells in specific phases of the cell cycle applies to other cell types, experiments were also performed in which mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells were grown in logarithmic phase in Fischer's medium (14) with 10% newborn calf serum, subjected to density gradient electrophoresis, and analysed for DNA content by flow eytome.ry. In complete analogy with Figure 10 for T-lE cells, these cells also shown electrophoxetic enhancement of G1 cells in rapidly migrating fractions and of G 2 cells in slowly migrating fractions.t 11-8 L -7 DISCUSSION }The migration rate of cells in density gradient electrophoresis depends vp_n their position in the cell cycle, and rapidly migrating fractions are clearly enriched in early G 1 cells, while slowly migrating fractions are enriched in G ? cells. Preliminary evidence indicates that this principle applies to more than one cell type. The results of the density-gradient electrophoretic studies are consistent with the hypothesis that RPM is highest at the beginning of the cell cycle, as shown in - several previous reports (4,6,7,9). Published results, strictly inter- preted, do not indicate a rise in RPM during G 2 phase, and the present results are consistent with lowest RPM occurring at G 2 phase. f Density-gradient electrophoresis differs from microscopic analytical electrophoresis in many ways, including the necessity to use low ionic strength buffers and the presence of the sedimentation component in the cell migration velocity. Although provisions are madef for the gradient to be very close to neutral buoancy throughout the separation process, it ! is possible that sedimentation plays a significant role cell separation by this method, and this possibility is under continuing investigation. iTable 1.

Todd The application of electrophoretic purification to the problem of purifying cultured cells according to function presumes that the size of cycle-phase of a cell will not be an overriding determinant of its electrophoretic velocity in an electrophoretic separator. Experiments were therefore performed in which the size distributrions and D..iA distributions of fractions of cells purified by density gradient eler-trophroesis were deter7ained. `;o systematic dependence of electrophoretic migraction upward in a density gradietn column upon either size or DYA content were found. In contrast, human leukemia cell populations, which are more uniform with respect to function and found in all phases of the cell cycle during exponential grorth, separated on a vertical censity Zradient electrophroesis column according to their size, which is easily shown to be strictly cell-cyc a dependent. RESULTS In third-passage cultures of heterogeneous populations of human embryonic kidney cells (i1FIK 9) the size distributions of various electrophoretic fractions suggest that cell size and electrophoretic migration are not related in a systematic and significant ua y. See Figure 1. In third-* passage cultures of heterogeneous populations of human embryonic ,ridney cells (!?F\"K- ) the !)';:1 distributions su^%est that cell cycle 7hase and electrophoretic migration are not related in a systematic and significant way.

In third-passage cultures of homogeneous populations of human B lynphora cells (line \"!W\"') the M.-A distributions of various electrophoretic fractions sug;est that cell cycle phase and electrophoretic migration are related in a systematic and significant wa y. In other experiments it was determined that the effect of cell size on sedimentation velocity during upward migration is responsible for the slot;er - .i,,rati_on or the larger, G2, cells. See Figure 5. t14-21 Figure,l. Coulter volume distributions indicate that there is no systematic variation in cell size with electrophoretic fraction number. Apparently sedimentation is not an important factor in the vertical separation of HFK cells.

In addition, a table of cell strains and recent data on cell dispersal methods are included. 1. ELECTROPHORETIC MOBILITIES OF KIDNEY CELLS IN D-1 BUFFER It was decided among laboratories that glycerol in A-1 buffer should be replaced by dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO); therefore, a need developed for ele.ctrophoretic mobility data on cultured human embryonic kidney cells subjected to electrophoresis in this buffer. The buffer composition is given in Table 1. Cells were removed from subconfl.uent cultures by incubation in 0.37% f EDTA in Puck's saline A (composition given in Table 2) or the same solution with 0.03% crude trypsin added. Cells were centrifuged out of these solutions and washed and resuspended in D-1 buffer for electrophoresis. The Zeiss Cytopherometer with Cam-Apparatus electrodes was used to obtain mobility histograms from the analysis of the complete cell flow parabola. A parabola giving cell velocity vs. chamber depth is shown in Fig. 1., and the mobility histograms are shown in Fig. 2. Due to the small number of cells available for measurement in the chamber there is no statistically significant difference between the histogram obtained with cells dispersed with trypsin and EDTA and that for cells dispersed with EDTA only. ILL any case, trypsin treatment did not reduce the electrophoretic mobilities.I 4. TESTING OF DISPERSAL PROCEDU RES The combination of cell dispersal with EDTA and suspensions in D-1 buffer still does not lead to fully satisfactory viability. Table 4 summarizes the results of a preliminary experiment designed to test the ability of D--1 buffer on its own to disperse cells. This experiment was based on a recently announced finding that DMSO at 10 % concentration disaggregates actin-containing microfilaments in epithelioid cells in culture. The results indicate that D-1 buffer does disperse cells, but that it might selectively suspend cells with low viability, since the traditional method employing EDTA in Puck's saline A led to much higher viability, as measured by percent attachment in 24 hours.

Elaine Kunze N85-31762 A systematic investigation was undertaken to characterize population shifts that occur in cultured human embryonic kidney cells as a function of passage number in vitro after original explantation. This approach to cell population shift analysis follows the suggestion of Mehreshi, Klein and Revesz that purturbed cell populations can be characterized by alectrophore.ic mobility distributions if they contain subpopulations with different electrophoretic mobilities. It has been shown that this is the case with early-passage cultured human embryo cells. The figure below shows that, in the case of strain \"HFK-40\" a downward trend in mean mobility was found during the first three passages in vitro, and this shift is mainly due to the reduction in the fraction of cells with high mobility (-1.6 to -10). 1557 HFK40 P1 A=--1.62\u00b10.20 B I.. is a - 0 i.4a Chapter 15, Densit y Gradient Electro phoresis of Cultured Human Embr yonic Kidney cells,16-1 DENSITY GRADIENT ELECTROPHORESIS OF CULTURED HUMAN EMBRYONIC KIDNEY CELLS L.

Todd N8531 - 7 6 INTRODUCTION Ground-based confirmation of the electrophoretic heterogeneity of human embryonic kidney cell cultures, the general characterization of their electrophoretic migration, and observations on the general properties of cultures derived from electrophhoretic subpopulations were the objectives of this research. To accomplish these objectives, the following sub-projects were undertakers 1.The relationship between cell migration in a density gradient electrohoresis column and cell electrophoretic mobility. 2.Comparison of the mobility and heterogeneity of cultured human embryonic kidney cells with those of fixed rat erythrocytes as model test particle. 3.Examination of electrohoretically separated cell subpopulations with respect to size, viability, and culture characteristics. RESULTS 1. The relationship between cell migration in a density gradient electrophoresis column and cell electrophoretic mobility. The composition of the buffer used for making the density gradient (Boltz ( et al., 197 1) is given in Table 1. The mixing of Ficoll and sucrose in this l buffer in the gradient maker gives an upward gradient of sucrose and a downward gradient of Ficoll, which has changing conductivity, viscosity, and effect on cell zeta potentials as a function position in the column. The dependence of conductivity on Ficoll concentration is given in Figure 1. It was poinLed out in an earlier report that standard tesL particles (fixed rat, chick, and rabbit erythrocytes (RBC)) were being used to calibrate the migration of cells in the density gradient column against the traditional analytical electrophoresis method using the Zeiss Cytopherometer. Careful measurements-of conductivity, viscosity, temperature, osmolarity, and density have now been made throughout the gradient. In.addition, it was necessary to measure the effect of Ficoll on the mobility of test parLicles in the column electrophoresis buffer, owing to the well -known effect of neutral polymers on effective zeta potenLial. Figure-2 clearly indicates that Ficoll increases zeta poLential, and the results predict that cellular zeta potential will decrease as cells migrate up the column toward lower Ficoll concentrations. By using this complete;k 11 o16-2 information set it is possible to predict the velocity a charged particle will have at any position in the column. The mathematical function V cFrkespon*Lr* these dependencies can be integrated to produce a migration function (Fig. 3 ) that is approximately quadratic near the bottom of the column and inverse exponential near.the top. This function correctly predicts the shapes of RBC migration plots (Fig. 4r f; and comes within 15% of predicting, the absolute value of the distance migrated by rat RBC's under the conditions described in Fig. 3:, Continuing data analysis and experimentation .indicate that the agreement between theory and experiment is actually much better, and algorithms are being, developed to convert density-gradient fraction numbers into mobility units. 2. Comparison of the mobility and heterogeneity of cultured human embryonic kidney cells with those of fixed rat erythrocytes as model test particle. During an attempt to prepare a ta:izporary spinner culture for elec- trophoresis of HFK cells at the 10th passage it was found that most of ^\") the cells died in suspension within 6-10 hr. and were not suitable for electrophoretic separation. The culture was re -plated and saved until the surviving cell: re-grew to confluence over a 75 cm 2 area. The resulting separated bands of RBC's and HFK cells were clearly visible (Figure5 l in scattered light, so the migration of the bands could be monitored by eye for determination of migration rates, as shown in Fig.6.- The average HFK cell migration rate is about 0.67 - 0.72 as great as that for fixed rat RBC's. Although the profile at the end of the separation was dominated by RBC's _, It could be shown by using Coulter volume analysis that the added QC's separated cleanly from the HFK cells. This separation is easier to visualize when the data are plotted on relative scales as in Figure 7. The HFK cells seem to occupy a single peak, so there is very little evidence for heterogeneity. This is not surprising, considering the selected nature of the cells. Each fraction was examined by phase microscopy after it had been plated in a 60 mm Falcon tissue culture dish, and additional heterogeneity was found. Fraction 8, the most populous fraction in culture (see Figure 8) contained viable cells which multiplied in suspension without attaching to anything. Fraction 6 contained fibroblasts that attached and spread and formed monolayers. Fractions 12 -15 consisted mainly of dead cells. Direct ob- servationa of fractions in cultures yielded information about purity, as shown in Figure 9. The purest fractions contained 97.8% HFK cells and 99.8% fixed RBC's; these were 3 fractions apart (about 1.5 cm in this case). Coulter volume analysis also facilitates the determination of peak compositions. Figure 10, which presents three volume histograms, shows that the starting mixture was mostly RBC's (channels 6 & 7) and that channels 5 & 6 include debris and some. RBC's while channels 11 & 12 account for most of the HFK cells. Fraction 5 is mainly RBC's, while fraction 10 is mostly HFK cells and debris. Cultures of fractions 6 & 8 have been maintained for further characterization.16-3 Early passage cells of strain K 7, electrophoresis after mixing with fi: electrophoretic profile indicated th ic modal HFK-1 cells is about 70% that { and the aon-adherent cells had about (\"round\") cells were fewer in number mobility was lower.

Non-adherent than attaching cells, and their average population was not studied for its uro- Most experiments to date have involved the collection of large-volume (0.5 - 1.0 ml) fractions, and in these early experiments high resolution separations were not the goal. Experiments in which 0.25 ml fractions are collected have begun with cell strain HFK-1. Fractions of 1.0 ml volume have given a resolution of Au(min) 0.054 pm-cm/V-sec per fraction after 4 hr of separation, and the harvesting of 0.25 ml (5 drop) fractions provides resolution of Au(min) 0.01 um-cm/V-sec. Fractions of HFK-1 cells have been collected at this latter resolution for fibrin slide analysis. The data of Figure 4 form the basis of these calculations. Figure 7 provides additional insight into resolution. The RBC and HFK cell peaks are separated by 4 fractions and are 1.5 and 2.0 fractions wide, respectively. These numbers give Ax 4 - 1.14 i 3.5x as the classical separability resolution. 3. Examination of electrohoretically separated cell subpopalations with respect to size, viability, and culture characteristics.i I By combining, the results of this work period with those presented in previous progress reports it becomes clear that different primary cultures produce different electrophoretic mobility profiles. Some additional examples are presented here. Cell strain HFK-7 produced copious quantities of non-adherent cells, and the electrophoretic migration plot o Fig. 1 .2 indicates quite clearly that the non-adherent cells belon 6 ed to a completely different mobility class from the fioroblasts, which dominated to is cell strain at the 6th passage, when this separation was performed. The morpholo6y of the cells in the fractions was determined by phase-contrast microscopy of the plated cu3.Lures. As was found to oe the case with other RYK strains, this cell strain was much more heterogeneous at earlier passa-aes. Fig. 13 shows the migration plot (EXP 1028) of a separation experiment with strain HFK-7 at passage #2, which is the earliest possible culture passage available to us for study. In tats experiment alternating fractions were plated and counted so that quantitative counts (in- cluding volume distributions) and evaluations in culture could be obtained on adjacent fractions. This is the procedure followed in about 7A of the HFY separation experiments. The density gradient electrophoretic distribution profile, Fig.14, confirms that these cells are very oroadly distributed with respect to electophoretic mobility. Although bD pairs of fractions were collected over a 12- em migration distance in this experiment, electrophoretic hetero- geneity was not manifested as a number of sharp peaks but as a broad distribution. Both cases have been seen in past experiments, but sharp peaks are more likely to appear when smaller fraction are collected. ^y^y.16-4 A very homogeneous population of (epi.thelioid) kidney cells designated ' HFK-10 was found to have a narrow electrophoretic profile after density gradient electrophoresis. In Figure 15 it is seen that nearly all of the viable cells were found in only in the narrow band bet ,:,%en fractions 49-58, and that fractions above and below this band contained mainly unattaching, non-viable cells. The Coulter counts of these fractions (dta not shown) matched this profile. Further evidence of the homogeneity of this population LS found in the Coulter volume distributions of three widely-separated fractions in Figure 16. Different starting materials have produced different results. Figure 17 presents a density-gradient electrophoretic profile of cells trypsinized from passage 10 of strain HFK. The starting population con- sisted only of about 10 5 cells, and Coulter volume analysis was the only procedure applied to each fraction. Although most of the cells in the starting culture were fibroblastic, there is evidence for considerable electrophoretic heterogeneity. Fractions numbered 35 or higher consisted of clumped cells which sedimented farther during upward electrophoretic migration. When only large clumps were counted (Channel 13 on Coulter Counter TA II) they were found principally near the bottom of the gradient; Their distribution is indicated by the empty circles. None of the fractions from this experiment were saved for further culturing. Over the entire period of the project all kidney cell cultures of reasonable quality have been subjected to density gradient electrophoresis, so that several dozen experiments have been performed using this technique. The solutions used in the Columns have in all cases been those described in Table 1. Figures 19 through 33 constitute a catalog of electrophoretic profiles of a variety of kidney cell cultures. Many of these have been presented in ear.,_er reports, but some trends are now beginning to emerge. Early results, Figure 19 , confirmed that human kidney cell cultures are electrophoretically heterogeneous and therefore present the possibility of separating cells according to function. Figures 20 and 21 illustrate that it is possible to determine electrophoretic mobility profiles of different classes of cells identified by size in the Coulter volume analyser. At least one size class, Channel 12, had a bimodal mobility distribution. 1 In highly heterogeneous populations, such as described in Figs. 22, 24, and 25, there is a high-mobility population of cells that are non-16-5 viable by microscopic in vitro criteria. This appears to be a very consisten t observation. As indicated previously, as well as in Fig. 25, strain HFK-10 had a very large population of very-low-mobility viable cells. There is no evidence than these are UK producers. Figures 26 through 29 portray a computerized version of the analysis described in Fig. 21, namely the determination of the electrophoretic profiles of cells in specific volume classes as determined by Coulter volume spectro- metry. Again, multimodal electrophoretic distributions are found within size classes. Figures 30 through 33 describe electrophoretic profiles of recently- acquired cell strains, and it can be seen that microscopic evaluation continues to reveal a high-mobility fraction of cells with low viability. Cultures from these fractions are to ae analysed for UK production also. Table I.

Williams, M. Elaine Kunze, and Paul. Todd ABSTRACT Four major cell types have been identified by phase microscopy in early-passage human embryonic kidney cell cultures: small and large epi.thelloid, domed, and fenestrated cells. Fibroblasts are also present in some explants. The per cent of each cell type changes with passage number as any given culture grows; as a general rule, the fraction of small epithelioid cells increases, while the fraciton of fenestrated cells, always small, decreases further. When fibroblasts are present, they alway increase in percentage of the total cell population. Electrophoretic separation of early-passage cells showed that the domed calls have the highest electrophoretic mobility, fibroblasts have an.intermediate high mobility, small epithelioi.d cells have a low mobility, broadly distributed, and fenestrated dells have the lowest mobility. All cell types were broadly distributed among electrophoretic subtractions, which were never pure but only enriched with respect to a given, cell type. INTRODUCTION Primary human embryonic kidney cells, when placed in culture, maintain several differentiated functions (Ireighton et al., Bern,ik and Kwaan, Taub et al., Sato), and these are reflected biochemically as well as morphologically. Commercializable biochemical products are produced by some of these subpopulati,ons, so their purification and characterization has both scientific and practical. value. The correlation of a morphological property with a biochemical, function, as has been done in the case of the pancreas, liver, and anterior pituitary, for example, would greatly facilitate the purification of biochemically specific kidney cells for study and applicatuas. MATERMALS AND METHODS Human embryonic kidney cells were purchased from MA Bioproducts, Inc., Rockville, Maryland, as fresh sheets of cells prepared from human embryonic kidneys. Some of these were subcultured for experiments through passage 1 2, 3, etc. using a 1:2 or 1:4 split ratio, some were frozen at these passages for subsequent study, -and some were used immediately for experiments. They were propagated in Medium 199 with 10% fetal bovine serum. Electrophoretic separations were accomplished using. the density gradient procedures and equipment described by Boltz et al. (1973, 1977). Morphological types Tji?re scored on the basis of appearance of cells, as shown in the photographs of Figure 1 and the sketches of Figure 2, under phase contrast at a. total magnification of 20OK. The two sizes of epithelioid cells were sometimes lumped into a single class. Approximately 1,000 cells wer counted per datum. RESULTS Epithelioid cells were found to be the dominating cell type in early-passage cultures. Fenestrated cells, although very conspicuous by their bizaxre appearance, were always very few in number, almost never constituting more than 107. of any culture. Table 1 is a sketch of the growth patterns found in early :passage cultures derived from three different explants. Although gross differences are seen with respect to the per cent of each cell: type inAl U17-2. ^. each culture strain, their growth trends are very consistent. As days pass in 1 culture and the number of monolayer cells increases, the fraction of fenestrated cells always decreases$ the fraction of fibroblasts always t..- increases (when they are present), and domed, cells appear to increase at about the salve rate as the overall, culture growth. This finding is also expressed in Figure 3, which is a plot of percentage of each cell type vs. days in 2nd passage culture. Electrophoretic separation of early-passage cells into subfractions by density gradient electrophoresis never yielded pure populations of any of the 5 cell types, but nearly all fractions were enriched with respect to one or more of the cell types. Figure 4 is a plot of the per cent of each cell, type in each electrophoretic subfraction. Electrophoresis was upward, and the column was harvested from the top, so low fraction numbers correspond to high electrophoretic mobility and vice versa. Domed cells were nearly 3 times as frequent in high-mobility fractions as in low-mobility fractions, while exactly the reverse was true of epithelioid cells. These two cell types constituted more than 95% of the initial starting population, so-their distributions should be reflexive of one another. The maximum number of fibroblasts appeared at the center of the electrophoretic distribution, while fenestrated cells were found only in the lowest mobility fractions. REFERENCES R. E. Allen, P. H.

UROKINASE PRODUCTION BY ELECTROPHORETICALLY SEPARATED CULTURED HUMAN EMBRYONIC KIDNEY CELLS * \u2014 ^i^ M. E. Kunze, L. D, Plank, V. Giranda, K. Sedor, and P. Todd INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE Urokinase is a plasminogen activator found in urine (Celander and Guest, 1960). Relatively pur preparations have been tested in Europe, Japan and the United States for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and other dangerous blood clots. This treatment method appears to have great potential, but a single dose requires material prepared from nearly 100 man--days of urine. Human embryonic kidney cell cultures have been found to produce urokinase at much higher concentrations, but less than 5% of the cells in typical cultures are producers (White and Barlow, 1970; Huseby at al., 1977). Since humman diploid-cells become senescent in -culture the selection of clones derived from single cells will not provide enough material to be useful., so a bulk purification method is needed for the isolation of urokinase producing cell populations. Preparative cell electrophoresis was chosen as the method, since evidence exists (Knox, 1978) that human embryonic cell cultures are richly heterogeneous with respect to electrophoresis. mobility, and preliminary electrophoretic separations on the Apollo-Soyuz space flight produced cell populations that were rich in urokinase production (Allen at al., 1977). Similarly, erythropo^e n is useful in the treatment of certain anemias and is a kidney cell pro{' `may , and el.ectrophoretical.ly enriched cell populationsproducing this product have been reported (Allen at al., 1977). Thus, there is a clear need for diploid human cells that produce these products, and there is evidence that such cells should be separable by free--flow cell electrophoresis. Progress made in the Project Laboratory Human embryonic kidney cells have been acquired from commercial produders and given serial names: HFK 1, HFK-2, etcs. The cell strains have been subcultured and/or frozen in liquid nitrogen. Microscopic and density gradient electrophoresis have been applied to these populations, and evidence has been found favoring the notion that urokinase producing cells should be separable by preparative electrophoresis, such as free-flow electrophoresis. Human kidney HFK 3 cells at the first passage were separated by density gradient electrophoresis, and fractions were grown in culture in 5 ml coulpl.ete medium in 60 mm tissue culture dishes for two weeks. After the supernatant was sampled for urokinase activity it was sampled for non-adherent cells.' The mono- layers were trypsinized and also counted. It appeared from the cell-count profile that fractions containing the high numbers of attached cells also contained high numbers of unattached cells. Coulter volume spectrometry revealed that non-adherent cells were smaller than attached cells by as much as a factor of 4 in volume. The fractions highest in cells did not coincide with maximum urokinase production. It, therefore, appears that urokinase producing cells were a rather small pro- portion of this particular explant and that UK activity was high, on a per cell basis, in the lower--mobility fractions..-.=sl _` ti18-2 Similar separation experiments were performed at passage l and passage 2 of strain HFK-3, and specific cell fractions were found to produce UK in both cases. Unfortunately, the applied electric fields were not the same in the two experiments, so the fractions could not be directly related. In both cases, UK producing cells appeared to be at least biomodically distributed among the collected fractions. It is possible that there will be more than one electrophoretic population of cells producing UK in cultures in general, The cell population described by the data of figure 8 behaved similarly. There were two electrophoretic peaks of urokinase producing cells, and there was evidence for two populations whose UK production increased between day 12 and day 13 in culture after electrophoretic separation. In these experiments UK activity was assayed on aliquots of supernatant culture medium using the colorimetric 4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide method. Activity units per viable cell in separated fractions have not yet been determined. Figures 9 through 12 show UK production in cultures of cells grown from collected fractions in density- gradient electrophoresis experiments. The distribution of UK production relative to total cells varies among cell strains and passage numbers. For example, in Fig. 9 UK production occurred in cells with higher mobility than the majoriLy ., whereas, in Fig. 11 UK production followed total cells/fraction rather closely. Strain IIFK-10 persistently had a large population of %jary low mobility cells (Fib. 12), and UK production occurred in cells with higher mobility. Figures 9 and 10 illustrate computerization of UK acL ivi.Ly caiculutiUns which Will finally make possible.the expression of UK production in electrophoretic fractions in CTA units/million cells/day. V The profile of UK produ ction closely parallels the number of cells PLATED per vessel in Figure 13, but when the actual number of cells per vessel is counted at the time of the UIt assay, it is found that there is a distinct peak of high-UK producing cells in cultures derived from near the front of the band of migrating cells (Figure 14). This finding will be found consistent with many other experiments, including those conducted in microgxavity. This finding was repeated in the case of cell strain HFK-18 (Figure 15) and subsequently with cell strain 8514 using continuous flow electropho\u2014re-sis. This result also reveals that high UK producers multiplied much less than their lower-mobility counterparts. In summary, electrophoretic separations have produced populations of viable adherent and non-adherent cells and cell fractions capable of producing differing amounts of UK upon subsequent cultivation.

Verso- pressin(used for growth and morphology) could be partially replaced. by isobutylmethylxanthine or dibutyryl cAMP. The defined medium was used to isolate rabbit proximal tubule kidney epithelial cells free of fibroblasts. The paper, Continuous growth of proximal tubular kidney epithelial cells in homone-supplemented serum-free medium, makes a few misguided assumptions about proximal vs distal tubules and properties of LLC-PK^ cells, but basically provides a good model for defined media studies. C,1 x^I. Background A. Kidneys (see figure 1 and 224) The functional structure of the kidney is the nephron. It is here that mine forms, beginning in the glamerulus 'capillary system., From the glomerulus the fluid that will become urine enters the proximal tubule (P.T.) where solutes and water are reabsorbed in Gaual amounts. Active sodium reabsorption drives all other transports in the P.T., e.g., passive movement of water-out of the tubule and coupled reabsorption of glucose. Entering the Loop of Hen1e, the fluid loses water and solutes, forming a gradient.that concentrates the urin o that the only reabsorption needed in the distal and collecting tubules is fine tuning.24 B. Hormones The hormones examined in the paper were insulin, transferrin, cholesterol prostaglandins, hydrocortisone, and triidothyronine. In vivo, the hormones act and interact onspecific tissues. Insulin causes glucose release, but has little effect on glucaBe transport in the kidney. Transferrin is a P-globulin that combines with iron to transport it in the plasma. Vasopressin(antidiuretic hormone--- ADH) controls reabsorption of water in the kidney =s late distal tubule and collecting duct. Cholesterol forms cholic acid in the liver, leading to bile formation. Prostaglandins cause vasoconstriction or vasodilation. Prostaglandin . 2 is produced in the kidney and causes vasodilation. Hydro cortisone(cort?sol) stimulates gluconeo.- genesis in the liver by mobilization of amino acids from extra-cellular fluid. Triidothyronine is present in small amounts, but is very potent at increasing metabolic rate. ^hr;l 1 Q -2- - i - I C. Eptthelial Cells in Culture Studies of epithelial cells in culture have many advantages: (1) minimum variability among samples. Genetic differences are ,; reduced by developing samples from the same precursors, and differences in nutrition, endocrinology, and age can be eliminated. (2) large amounts of homogeneous material can be grown. (3) samples can be stored frozen and examined later. (4) cultures of a single cell - type can be develo ped and genetically dissected to discover cell function mechanisms. Cereijido and associates(1979) found epithelial .ell lines in culture to be polar and form hemicysts(fluid filled spaces.) The reason forolarit is unclear. but f\" p y polarity is attachment dependent with the basolateral plasma membrane facing the supporting surface and the apical membrane facing the medium(see figure 3). The direction of transport can be determined-watching fluid movements and specific tolar budding of enveloped viruses, Hemicyst(dome) formation is unique to confluent epithelia-and is seen in kidneY)8'10 mammary gland, liver, 15 and urinary bladder 6 cells. Rabito, et al jtf (1980) found hemicyst formation dependent on transepithelial transport and cell substratum adhesion strength which is modified by, for }example, dibutyryl cyclic AMP. When adhesion strength increased ., f hemicyst formation decreased. 16 Hemicyst formation is stimulated by cAMP, theophylline, or papaverine. 23 Hemicyst formation can not be used to quantify transport since formation..dependt on epithelial ability to seal in transported fluid, amount of adhesion of basal membrane to the surface, and rate of transport; however, it can be used as an indicator of transport in new cell lines. 18 ^^.Kidney cell function can be determined in culture by such thing as transepithelial transport, hormone and drug control of transport, and hormone secretion. Cell culture could overcome kidney studies' problems of too much and too little--too much variety in whole kidney extracts and too little material in dissected kidney segments. A totally defined medium in which kidney epithelial cells grow and differentiate could facilitate selection of cell-of interest and r study of their function,\u00b0 D. Madin-Darby Canine Kidney Cell Line (?4DCK) Hull, nt al (1976) suggested the 1EDCK cell line has the properties of distal tubule e pithelial kidney cells. Cereijido(1978) and Hul1(1976) independently found dome formation due to active fluid transport from top to bottom occured with a specific trans- epithelial electric potential and microv illi facing into the media. The electron microscope showed structural polarity, microvilli facing the medium, smooth membrane across from the solid support, and individual cells joined by tight junctions(see figure 3. )19 Cereijido, ^Lt al 41978) saw abnormal cytological characteristics like large nuclei and abnormal mitotic figures. When these cells were injected into chick embgos, metastatic lesion developed. 2 MDCK cells lack the s enzyme markers of proximal associates(1979) stimulated adenylate cyclase(an enzyme involved prostaglandins, in lines. Cyclic AMP 22 and cell differentiation inducers 11 stimulate hemicy st formation. E.. Pig--derived Cell .

Kemicyst formation and tight junctions lead to cell sheet epithelial transport in LLC-PK, cells. a Goldring and associates(1978) found adenylate cyclase activity sensitive to vasopressin and calcitonin. II. Continuous Growth of Proximal Tubular Kidney Epithelial Cells in Hormone-supplemented Serum-free Medi=. . and Methods Basic cell were used: LLC-PK^ cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium supplemented with horse and fetal bovine serum or hormones. Rabbit proximal tubule, kidney epithelial ce ps were microdissected and grown in the hormone defined medium. B.Results The hormones added to the medium were transferrin, insulin, hydrocortisone, triidothyronine, the hormone defined medium reduced LLC-PK, relative growth to about 40%0 of the defined medium control growth. Hydrocortisone (I C S--Z x 0\" (both-1 .\u00bb gM) were used for growth stimulation, and absence reduced growth to 75 and GO %, respectively. Adenylate cyclase aetivitfi was stimulated by vasonressin(10 'xtU/ml) in LLC-PK 1 and prostaglandin I (25 ng/ml) in MDCX, either rs absence reduced growth to about .30,a. Cholesterol (10 -8 ' q) was added only to LLC-PK, j cells, and its absence reduced growth to 70%. With all other hormone'Z0 -^- concentrations normal, each hormone was varied in concentration. Transferrin and insulin dose response curves rose quickly to the defined medium concentration then dropped. Triidothyronine, hydrocortisone, and cholesterol curves continued upward; vasopressin curve rose quickly then remained fairly constant.(See figure 4.) There was no growth inhibition for any of the concentrations. LLC--PK 1 cells grew slower in the defined medium(doubling time = 26.4 h, serum = 21.5 h) with a lower efficiency(70 01'0 vs 97\u00b0x.) Hemicysts formed with e qual frequency in the defined and serum media. Vasonressin requirements for growth was partially replaced by isobutylmethylxanthine or dibutyryl cAMP, which caused similar morphological changes to vasopressin. Electron microsoopy showed the LLC-PK 1 cells to be similar in either medium, except the brush j. boarder was denser, but shorter microvilli in the hormone serum. MDCK cells grew iin. LLC-PK 1 defined medium, but with no hemicyst formation; however, LLC-PK, cells did not grow in MDCK medium. LLC--PK 1 defined -medium was. uded.t4 isn7 ;a..te primary cultures of carefully microdissected of kidneys. When testing P.T. specificity, cortical collecting duct also grew in the medium; therefore, the medium was not selective for P.T. cells. C. Discussion LLC--PK 1 cell line of presumed P.T. origin grew in a serum--free medium similar to that needed by the V I CK line. Medium specificity was indicated by LLC-PK 1 cells ra pid growth without serums hemicyst formation similar to that in serum, and epithelial isolation from a microdissected P.T. from rabbit kidney. Some other factor for growth was not in the defined, medium since cells grew faster in ^- serum. This was also seen by . primary cultures of carefully micro-t 11, 1 J it FJ dissected P.T. from rabbit kidney. Some other factor for growth was not in the defined medium since cells grew faster in serum. Also, primary cultures of P.T. epithelial cells !lid not differentiate (no dense microvillous brush boarder.) The defined medium could be used to determine cell surface receptors of LLC-PK^ cells, molecular growth requirements for the cells, hormonal dependencies for expression of biochemical traits, also for isolation of P.T. epithelial cells in other species. - f III. Critia ue-F LLC-PK1 cells were assumed to be proximal tubular; however, these cells have properties of other kidney segments. The glucose '. transport Qs similar to proximal tubules;21 adenylate cyclase activity R is similar to that in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle; and high trans-epithelial resisCance like the collect ing,. duct. It would be hard to convince a renal physiologist that LLC-PK, t cellsI act as anything but LLC--PK I cells. However, the specific action, e.g., fluid transport, may be studied in these cells as a general. process. Microdisseetion of proximal tubule segments has been successful, 24 but the experimenters should have double checked the P.T. segment culture by using other tests like specific enzyme markers lake maltase, trehalase, sodium-dependent glucose uptake, and p-Camino hippurate(PAH) uptake. In Vae results, collecting duct segments also grew in the defined medium, yet the conclusions state the medium could be used for-isolation of P.T. epithelial cells in other species. There were other hormones that affect kidneys that may have been used to further study the P.T. vs L.T. question. Aldosterone^t l stimulates sodium reabsorption and potassium se-cretion in the D.T. Angiotensin causes water and salt rellention. ADH(vasopressin) could also be used as a D.T. and P.T. parameter because ADH causes water reabsorption only in D.T. and C.D. of the kidney. Being picky, several \"data not shown\" statements were included in the results. If the data is not shown, we should not be expected to believe without seeing. `This should not be a test of faith and trust; Finally, cultured cells are not a system. Perha ps the effects of hormones on biochemical traits can be examined in culture, but it would be a pure model with difficulties in extrapolating into in vivo situations. Hormones interact with each other in the body, as do tissues and systems. Without these interactions, I P wonder howractical cultured cells would seem from a sP physiologist's QUALITY Fi,ure 1^.

CONDITIONS ON EACH EXPERIMENT, \"1 ^tii The 37\u00b0C incubation was carried out in the incubator without COz, however the slides were open to the air resulting in partial drying. Slides were fixed in formaldehyde for 30-60 minutes and stained with hema- toxylin twice, once for 2 minutes and then again for 20 minutes. EXPERIMENT II Slides U21-6, El-4 Repeat of Experiment I, the same cell lot and procedure. EXPERIMENT III Slides Ucl--6, NCI,II, Excl-12 Cells, from the same lot as above, were groan directly on the micro- scope slides until fairly confluent. Then, they were rinsed with Hanks Balanced Salts and then with distilled water. The procedure that followed was the same as above with the exceptions of a 1 hour fixation in formaldehyde and 20 minutes of staining in hematoxylin. EXPERD E11T IV Slides U DI-6, 8 cont, ED1--1.2 Cells in this experiment were from a newer, heartier lot than before. These cells were also grown directly on the slides but only for 24 hours. The slides were then rinsed with Hanks to remove the excess media. During the 37 0 incubation, a moist chamber was used to prevent the slides from drying out. This chamber was put into the moist incubator for I hour. Finally, the slides were fired in formaldehyde overnight and then stained for 40 minutes in hematoxylin. EXPERIMENT V Slides UE1-2, RB262 2-78 Cells were obtained from an electrophretic fraction from the newer HIM lot. These cells were cytospun onto the slides and kept cold until use. The pro- cedure was then the same as the above.^e7-2.-5- ,r fli \" 3RESULTS: Rapid-inspection of the stained slides showed that all the slides had a \"Swiss cheese\" appearance; it looked as though holes had been poked in the lights_- stained clot. These characteristic holes were seen on all the slides: the urokinase controls, the negative controls and the experimental slides. Staining with the hematoxylin would yield color in the following degrees: Complete areas of no color (lysis zones?), light staining (fibrin clot?), and dark staining (cells and other debris). DISCUSSION: In veiwing the slides, I had thought that the first few experiments had worked as expected because the urokinase control slides seemed to decrease in the num- ber of 'holes' that it contained depending on the urokinase concentration that was added. Then, I happened upon the negative controls which showed the same *holes' but not to the same degree. None of the slides with cells showed any good zones of lysis within the area of the premarked square. One interesting thing that was observed was that the cells had the ability to 'eat' away at the black marker that was being used. This would cause problems in containing the forming clot in the necessary boun- daries on the slide. Another problem dealt with the staining time. Initially a 2 minute stain was tried with little success. Next a 20 minute time was employed. Finally, a 40 minute staining period was tried with the best results. Even with the 40 min- ute staining period, the fibrin clot stained very lightly in comparison with the cells, which took the stain extremely well. 0 Incubation time in the 37 C chamber was a problem with this experiment. Ac- cording to Kwaan and Astrup, when the clot is made over the smear of cells, the-22--6- r, s ^ cime required for formation and stabilization of the clot makes the proper in- cubation period less well defined. Also, the incubation time is dependent on fi^I the particular cell type that is being tested as well as the different manufac- tures for the standard urokinase. According to the original paper, with longer incubation times, even a weakly active site will be detected. According to Kwaan and Astrup, \"to achieve a detailed and discrete localiza- tion. of active sites, the fibrinogen must be rich in plasminogen, low in inhibi- tor content with clottability above 85 -90%, containing no spontaneous fibrino- lytic activity (including such caused by bacterial contamination), be free of citrate and be soluble at high concentration (about 1%) without sedimentation. We have found no commercial preparations which fulfill all of these criteria, iii. particular, they arelow in plasminogen and therefore low in sensitivity to activators.\" (1) Perhaps this would be a good place to start to work on the assay-determine\" L exactly what combination of ingredients yield the best clot. By keeping all solutions filtered and cold, this cuts down on the bacterial contamination so that should not be a problem. It could be possible to change the incubation time for the clot formation to give a better result.. To determine the best incubation time in the 37 0C chamber, a quick test will have to be run with each new batch of urokinase standards, if there is any in- tention of correlating the different experiments. This is easily done by placing samples of each dilution on the same slide and then incubating for various pe- riods of time and then comparing the results. Once this is done, it will be possible to scan an experimental slide and determine the actual concentrations of activator present based on the degree of lysis. In summation, I think that after the best clot mixture is determined the assay will yield good.results.. Staining . and reading the slides at this time may be no problem if the right mixture is discovered.C^ isr LE Z Z-7-- ^ REFERENCES: Kwaan, Eau C. and Astrup, Tage, 17, Demonstration. of Cellular Fibrinolytic Activity by the Histochemical Fibrin Slide No. 2, pages 140-5, 1967.23-1 Y769RECOMMENDATIONS AND CALCULATIONS CONCERNING PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EEVT APPARATUS Several issues arose during the course of preparing for the flight of EEVT on STS-3, and these involved several institutions. Although this is not a formal. report, It envelopes some of the correspondence and documents that highlight the discussions that occurred during the establishemnet of certain policies pertinent to the execution of the EEVT experiment. Documents concerning the issues are presented in the following order: 1.The possibility of mixing latex spheres with kidney cells as standard electrokinetic markers. 2.Tube breakage and the potential fo the development of leaks and bubbles. 3.Effects of the shape of the sample gate on the electric field and the outward migration of cells -- M. Reynolds. 4, Suggestions for reducing electroosmosis by decreasing the diameter of the sample ---- J. 0, N. Hinckley, 5.

THE POSSIBILITY OF MIXING LATES SPHERES WITH KIDNEY CELLS Spheres mixed with monolayers of kidney cells were found to be unrecoverable from the cultures. This finding was consistent with published observations that cultured cells grown in the rpesence of 1 million latex particles/ml medium incorporate the spheres into the cytoplasm by phagocytosis.

Blectrophoresis tube Preakage has bo be taken somewhat more seriously than in the past. One tube has already broken in the laboratory in the absance of unusual stredses while it was empty. Judging from the natur3 of the fracture (it showed concoidal fracture surfaces) there TdMX must have been a flaw in the tube created during fabrication. It is recommended that after fabrication, tubes be subjected to optical. ;analysis, such as UV schlieren testing or whatever quality control testing is traditionally done by glassblowers when glass parts are fabricated for critical or high-stress applications. Several tubes that were processed on Apollo 14, Appollo 16, and ASTP developed bubbles. It is suggested that the formation of bubbles might be due to the evapoartion of water following its diffusion thfFough the plastic containers, especially those with thin walls (bags) used for electrode buffer recycling. Water diffiusing air out and gXX diffusing in while liquids are held in plastic is a rblatively common problem. Perhaps measures that retard this process would help prevent bubble formation in electrode buffer in future experiments. This notion should be tested in the Laboratory very soon, bu simply letting, water (or buffer) stand in the system for a few days and turning it on as if in a run. The bubbles which may have formed, however, might not have the same effect on i-he earths surface as in microgravity, for the simple reason that the principal force on bubbles at 1 g is buoyancy, whereas the principal force in orbit is electrophoresis, which would sweep bubbles to one end of the electrophoresis tube from the electrode buffer compartment.Reply IoAtln ofS 05-81-MIS-'02 Dr. F.

Stubby Zones without a Constricted Sample Gate. by J. 0. N. Hinckley This reduces cell quantity, in the same way as does a narrower bore sample gate, The cells are confined to the center of the gate, inside a halo of electrolyte (D-1 buffer, here) immobilized by gel, which halo mechanically retains the ice pellet in position prior to thaw. The gel halo can be retained by the same gentle ridge as is contemplated for the ice pellet, and the ice pellet can be likewise retained within the gel halo. The gel should be a very low EEO agarose, made up in D-l buffer to have identical conductivity. It should be cast in the gate. The hole in the gel for the ice pellet could be made by a cast preform, removable on insertion of the ice. Further, Elie rear of the gate could be a continuous agarose film, further retaining the cells from contact with the rear of the gate and the Spectrapore/agarose/fit assembly, f ; if desired. The pellet is inserted or frozen in situ (nb gel behavior on freezing etc - but bearable, or use a glycol-loaded gel). The current lines now go straight through the gel, and there are no corner backwaters or field problems. However (see under f ield-bending below), there may be merit in ensuring that the thawed pellet has a conductivity similar to the halo, event if this differs from the bulk D--1 conductivity in the column. GEL HALO VS. SMALLER HOLE23-8 t Electroconvection This occurs in free solution electrophoresis, in the experience of Philpot (1971 personal communication, 1973 in print briefly), and follows from field theory: according to Gauss-Coulomb's Law a variation in space of field strength must give rise to a local non-neutrality. The effect is observable in non-uniform electric field, where it is a source of leakage current in liquid transformer and high voltage insulating oils, and can even be used as an adjunct cooling circulation. (One would therefore expect it as a disturbance in dielectrophoresis, Pohl's method). Wherever there is a non-uniform field, we should be alert for electroconvention and dielectrophoretic effects (negligible compared with electrophoresis in DC and uniform fields). Electroconvection is related to EEO - just that in EEO the non- neutrallity is due to adsorption equilibria between wall and bulk solution, rather than due to field non-uniformity. The rule is avoid non--uniformities of bore e.g. sample gate, if narrow. Why look for trouble? Entrainment and stubby zones. This spectre I conjured up in 73/74 alo, and suggested its relation to the waisting and bullet heads of Apollo lb runs, which did not seem all so parabolic, but rather like gobs of chewing gum slowly detaching-----------------\u00bb--------- ------ in that any charge difference (cf. EEO) between clear buffer and a zone of cells would give rise to an elect rconvective situation; where it is less energetic for a zone to travel through clear buffer as a single quasi--macro-particle than for each cell to swim through its own fluid medium surrounding it. Thus liquid would be entrained by the zone, if there was buffer in hydraulic parallel. That is, a stubby zone could perhaps entrain buffer, and as it moves forward, the counterflow would be peripheral to the zone rather than intrazonal and equally1-- ZW co ^w^Z U o^\u00b0' w ^zrYw .j it ^ICd : 11 C W a m23-9 ^a.integrated across the tube section.

But it might be nice to know, before we get _ too deep into stubby zones, Con- ventional zones across the whole lumen section might be a safer conservation choice. Field- bending;, and stubby zones, and the gel--halo Another effect of both stubby zones and the gel. -halo idea is this. Cells tend to be electrically insulating, so replacement of some of a volume of buffer by a similar volume of suspended cells would reduce the conductivity of the buffer, in some proporation to the concentration of the suspension. Therefore, a stubby zone distorts its local electrical field (leading to electroconvention, etc?), which in turn affects the migration speed and pattern. I 'll be that one didn't get into the computer programs It applies to the gel--halo concept - which is why I think the halo should be made to have the same conductivity as the thawed pellet. Such field -bending may also be involved in the Apollo 16 anomalies. The effects of field-bending on a stubby zone are anticipated in the picture;'r. I. s',f.. 23-10 Lehigh Chemistry \"1 .

The ASTP experiments which fractionated viable cells, introduced considerable experimental and equipment difficulties. The biological samples were taken into space as frozen disks to assure both biological viability during pre--flight storage and sample conformation at the beginning of electrophoresis. The columns were frozen after electrophoresis to preserve the positions of separated biological cells and to preserve the cells for subsequent post-flight analysis and culturing.- The use of multiple columns required a separable connector between the electrode buffer circulation system and the electrodes of the individual columns, as shown in Fig. 1. Electrode buffer circulation was required to carry electrode gases to the phase separators. All operations on the ground and in space were done without introducing microbial contamination, as proven by the sterile culture of kidney cells sustained after the flight. All systems, however, did not work in flight for all experiments, and the Electrophoresis Equipment Verification Test (EEVT) was designed to repeat the most promising parts of the ASTP experiment with equipment that had been more thoroughly operated and tested in the laboratory before flight. The equipment worked as planned in space during the third Space Shuttle mission (STS-3), and photographs of the two columns with red blood cells were obtained. Information on the final distribution of the human and rabbit cells was lost when the frozen columns melted before sections could be cut and analyzed. ^. This report analyzes the photographs and describes. the pre-flight and post-flight I'..24- 3A 1 ASTP_Observations. The electrophoresis experiment conducted on: the Apollo--Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) was intended to separate model particles and biological cells by zone electrophoresis in the microgravity environment of orbital flight. The model particles, aldehyde-treated red blood cells from rabbit, human and horse, were used to test the column coating procedures developed to eliminate electroosmotic fluid flow and to emulate the inter-particle aspects of an electrophoretic separation without the added technical problems of sterility, cell viability, and particle heterogeneity. Additional columns contained human peripheral blood lymphocytes, cultured human embryonic kidney cells, and native red blood cells. Each experiment was performed in duplicate to determine reproducibility of cell fractionation. Only two columns from the four space experiments (eight columns) yielded results that encouraged further investigation: an enhanced urokinase production was measured from specific fractions of separated kidney cells, and good photographs of the fixed red blood cell separation showed the absence of electroosmotic fluid. flow. Nevertheless, neither of these experiments were without deficiencies. The two freeze-thaw cycles of the kidney cells substantially reduced cell viability, and the urokinase analyses were made with'very few cells. Kidney cells were also found, unexpectedly near the point of . sample insertion. This was not expected on the basis of ground--based mobility measurements., thus the cells may have been retarded while leaving the insertion slide.. The frozen column of red blood cells, whose separation was photographed in space, fractured while in the slicing apparatus. Frozen disks containing the blood cell fractions which could then be reconstructed to give a profile of the red cell populations were therefore not obtained. A knowledge of the precise to explain photographs which showed a _ distinct leading band of cells (presumably horse) followed by a broader band of mixed cells (human and rabbit).iJ . I24-4 Objectives of RISC Experiments on STS-3 The objectives of the red blood cell experiments on ASTP were to provide a visual check on the electrophoretic process and especially electroosmotic flow in space as well as to provide test separations of non-degradable standard particles for comparison with the separations of the three viable cell types studied on ASTP. Since electroosmosis was minimized in the ASTP columns and was not considered a problem for the Shuttle experiment, the objective of the reflight EEVT was less technical and more scientific in its scope. Determination of the maximum concentrations of cells that can be separated in column electrophoresis was a significant goal.. Two of the eight columns were available for red cell experiments, so two concentrations of human and rabbit RBC mixtures were used. During ASTP, dimensions of the column and sample insertion slide were chosen on the basis of compromise. The column internal diameter of 0.625 cm could not be increased without increasing the radial gradient of temperature and temperature-' dependentP arameters such as viscosity and conductivit y. The column length was suitable for the range of cell mobilities, the moderate applied electric field (-15 V/cm) and the available electrophoresis time interval. (one hour). The cylindrical sample insertion disk was 0.476 cm diameter and 0.31$ cm thick. The diameter was made less than the internal, diameter of the column to minimize the influence of any residual electroosmotic fluid flow at the column wall. The thickness was chosen on the basis of compromise that provided enough cells to be fractionated and collected and grown in culture, and adequate resolution of separation. The nuuLber of fixed red blood cells loaded into each 0.06 ml sample slide on ASTP was 5.2 x 10 6 rabbit, 3,4 x 10 6 human and 7.3 X 106 horse cells for an overall concentration of 2.6 x 10 6 cells/ml. The EEVT experiment compared the electrophoretzc behavior of this concentration of cells with that of cells 10 times as concentrated. ti` 1i 24-5 Human and rabbit cells were selected because they are of similar size not different mobility, and the concentration effect could be established with two species. Although horse cells as used on AST p or cat cells which were available for STS-3 have substantially higher mobilities than human cells, they have substantially higher mobilities than human cells they have a significantly smaller size, and adding them would add another factor to the analysis, so a third cell type.was not used. The human and rabbit cells are easily separated by continuous flow electrophoresis at concentrations of 2 x 10 8 cells/ml as Fig. 2 shows. Continuous flow electrophoresis has also separated fixed red blood cell populations (cow and turkey) at 10 9 cells/ml, although the separated bands are broad due to effects such as droplet sedimentation s Density gradient gradier_L electrophoresis is also limited by droplet sedimentation at RBC concentrations around 5 x 108 cells/ml6. Thus, one EEVT sample slide had a total of 2 x 10 8 cells/ml and the other slide had 1 x 10 9 cells/ml with equal numbers of fixed human and rabbit cells in each slide. Each erythrocyte has a biconcave discoid shape with a volume of about 40 cubic microns. The volume concentration of 1 x 10 9 cells/ml is thus approximately 10%, and 2 x 10 8 cells/ml occupies 2% of the starting buffer volume. Thus cell: migration and separation were studied at two starting concentrations. Objectives of Kidney Cell Experiments on _STS-3_ Only one column on ASTE yielded separated, live human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. The fractions each contained very few cells, and cell viability was extremely low. Nevertheless, post-flight evidence was found for the existence of electrophoretic fractions enriched in cells that produce urokinase (UK), erythropoietin (ESF) or granulocyte conditioning factor (HGCF)3'``. The objectives of the EEVT experiment were to evaluate the reproducibility of of microgravity electrophoretic separation of living cells, to separate cells with highly viability despite two freeze--thaw cycles, and to optimize the. physical tr^x.j24-6 conditions of cell separation. Owing to the uncertain heterogeneity of the starting material the experimental design does not assess resolution in microgravi( but improved separability was sought in comparison to density-gradient electro- phoresis 7 or continuous-flour electrophoresis, as in Fig. 3, which shows distributions of cells and UK activity after separation of HEK cells in McDonnell-Douglas Continuous Flow Electrophoretic Separator. Effort T. re made to increase cell yield and cell viability in the EEVT experiment and to assess reproducibility directly. An increase in cell vield was achieved by increasing the sample volume by _30%-compared to ASTP apparatus by increasing the sample-holder diameter to 0.584 cm. Viability was increased by the use of \"D-1\" buffer, in which the cryprotectant was DMSO rather than glycerol as was used in \"A-1\" buffer on ASTP. Reproducibility was to be achieved by using 0 identical columns. _ 5 1 _ ^___ SHUTTLE FLIGHT STS--3 1.Pre-flight characterization of fixed human erythrocytes Table 1 lists some pertinent measurements of the electrophoresic mobility of glutaraldehyde or formaldehyde fixed human RBC's in D--1 buffer and saline. A general value of 2.60 + 0.15 (+ S.D.) seems to apply. This is higher than that determined at MSFC, as indicated in Figure 4. The expected values in saline and the expected dependence of mobility on pH do not reveal unique features of the method of measurement that would explain the discrepancy readily. 2.Pre-flight characterization of fixed rabbit erythrocytes Table 2 lists some measurements of fixed rabbit RBC electrophoretic mobility in D-1 buffer. In all cases the fixation utilized glutaraldehyde, and a reasonable value was found in saline. Generally, the mobility in D-1 was 1.70 + 0.22 pm--cm/V-sec. Figure 4, however, favors mobility of formaldehyde-fixed rabbit RBC's in D-1 of about 1.45 Pm-cm/V-sec. 7 3.Pre--flight characterization of human embryonic kidney cells Numerous experiments were performed in which early-passage human embryonic kidney cell strain HEK-8514, passage 5, were subjected to density gradient electro- phoresis and/or microscopic electrophoresis. Figure 5 shows that the distribution is very broad, has a mode around 1.3, and is slightly narrowed and shifted downward by trypsinization. 4.Conclusions concerning RBC mobility measurements Mobility in D-1 is consistently higher than in A--1, but only by 0.1 - 0.2 unit. Mobilities measured in saline are in agreement with published values. The lowest human RBC mobilities in D-1 were 2.31 and 2.35; these were made in D--1 without DMSO, in. Cytopherometer and Pen^-Kem, respectively. The range of reliable mobilities of I formalin--fixed human RBC's is 2.54 - 2.79. Deriving mobilities from whole velocity parabolas does not increase the measured mobility. If anything, mobilities determined i '^sr \"\"24- 8 from parabolas are 0.1 - 0.2 unit less. Glutaraldehyde-fixed cells do not have higher mobility than, formalin-faxed cells. 5.Pre--flight determination of electrophoresis column resistances Figure 6 is a sketch, of the measurements used in determining resistances of the variouscolumn ceaponents.

With a dummy slide in place: RIOT = 61.37 + 13.74 (6) K With a sample slide in place: RIOT '44 52.9.8 + Z^y A'K'Nl^]^Y..^' - TAO+24-9 The electric field strength in the column must always be calculated from the relationship _ E = I/KA using the conductivity K rather than the voltage across the column. If there is a bubble in the column, for example, or any other disconrinuities in con- ductance, the total column resistance does not reflect the conductivity at the position of the cells, where the field must be known. Considering the assembly as resistors in series, RT = 2k + R S + RC where R E = electrode compartment resistance RC = column resistance RC = I/KA RS = sample slide resistance Under ideal conditions RC = RT -- 2R - RS = (I. - 2RE/ RS - RT/ R ) RT = CRT where C = constant, so a measurement of the total, column resistance R T and the length of the column 1 will give the average field strength throughout the column. E = VC/1 = IRC/1 = ICRT/l, which is the same as E = I/I:A. But if a buVIe is introduced a new resistance is added to the circuit, and RT = 2RE + RS + RC + RE where R B = bubble resistance then RC = CRT - RB and VC = ICRT - IRB tahere the value Measured in flight is V T = IRT , which will be high, and not 'ye:.PEEEIA, I e ^I T24-10 proportional to VC. The true field strength will be E = ICR T/l - IRB/lB where I = length of the bubble. This is not the same as E given above. If a bubble is present, the measured voltage on the EEVT apparatus cannot be used to estimate field strength. Unless it can be ascertained with certainty that a particular column did not contain a bubble, its field must be calculated from E = I/KA using the best value of K for that column, determined before flight and corrected for inflight temperature using the empirical formula, equation (7), and the conductivity--temperature curve of Fig. 7. E I 'i24-11 ^ 6. Pre-flight determinations of electrophoresis column conductivities l}Individual measurements on the columns loaded for flight indicated that the conductivity of the buffer in each column was different. This was explained by differential degassing of the solutions in each column and differential water loss, resulting in different electrolyte concentrations in the different columns. The conductivities were measured at various temperatures, and the resistance of column '067 was measured at two temperatures to obtain b-1 conductivity-temperature curves. These curves were scaled, as shown in Fig. 7, for purposes of predicting column voltages in each case under the conditions of flight, when T m 12-14%. The conductivities were ca:=culated using Equation (6), and they are shown in Table 3 at the temperatures at which they were measured. 7. Pre-flight predictions of column voltages during flight From the conductivity measurements and the temperature curve of FiQ. 7, applied to equation (7), the expected column voltages at 12\u00b0C and 14\u00b0C during flight were calculated. These are summarized in Table 4, along with the electroosmotic mobilities of the corresponding columns for later use in predicting band migration. B. Pre-flight predictions of cell migration profiles The electrophoretic mobility distributions of Figs. 4 and 5 were used, along with the electroosmotic mobility values in Table 4 to estimate the distances specific parts of the cell bands in each column would migrate. The expected positions of the foward and rearward boundaries of the cell bands are included in Table 5, and diagrams of the band profiles expected at the end of 60 rain are in Figure 8. 9. In-flight observations of column voltages Figure 9 summarizes column voltages at every minutes during the operation of the 6 columns that contained HEK-8514 cells. The legend at the right end of the figure shows the plotting symbols and the predicted voltages for each of the numbered columns.^124-12 A steady voltage rise was seer. in three of the columns, implying that heating by the current may have been expanding a bubble of significant diameter compared to the column. With twe exceptions the voltages ended higher than predicted. Tables 6 and 7 summarize the in-flight voltages of columns 019 and 049, respectively. These columns contained fixed red cells and were photographed with thermal cover off every 10-12 min. These times are denoted by asterisks (^), and small voltage and temperature excursions can be seen, especially as plotted in Figures 10 and 11. Under these conditions one would expect variable cell migration rates. 10.In--flight observation of cell migration When astronaut voice-downs of the cell migration distances were heard, it was determined that the fixed BBC's did not migrate as far as expected, they did not separate into two distinct bands, and the migration rate may not have been constant. The data are shoran in Fig. 12, and drawings of the cell, bands from the photographs that were taken during flight are shown. in Fig. 13 and 14. These, too, reveal that 6.. the cells did not migrate as far as expected and that they did not force two distinct - bands. 11.Analysis of column photographs Negative photographs of the columns were scanned along a position just off the center of the projection of the long axis of the column using a film densitometer (Fig. 1. which produced a strip--chart record of uncalibrated light transmission vs. uncalibrated position. Aensitometer readings were listed numerically, and absolute distances were established using Risso marks on the camera and the positions of landmarks such as column thermistors. These numerical readings are listed in Tables 8 and 9, as a function of time, for the two columns. Pairs of these o l,`ical scans were analyzed using a program in BASIC/RT-11 which matched the scans along the axis of migration, normalized them, and subtracted one from the .other... Usually,. as in Figure 16, a scan. of the baseline is determined,I f24-13 at 11 min, before cells appear, and displayed as a solid curve. The scan containing a cell band is displayed as a dotted curve. The baseline has considerable structure, owing to the reflectance of the column and the method of illumination. The difference appears as a broad peak of relative light absorption vs. column position. Figures 17 and 18 show optical absorption profiles as a function of time for colums 019 and 049, respectively. As previously noted, migration was not as rapid as expected, the cell bands were not sharp, and there is a lack of clear structure in the absorption profiles that is evidence of human and rabbit cell separation. 12.Comparison of results and redactions In Table 10 the predicted 52-minute migration distances of human. (p = 2.05 Pm - cm/ V--sec) and rabbit (u = 1.45 pm -- cm/V-sec) cells (Figures 1 and 2 in columns 019 and 049 are compared with the positions of the leading and trailing edges of the observed, optically-scanned cell bands (Fig. 17 and 18). The cells did not uigrate as far as predicted. 13.Post--Flight analysis of buffer effects The conductivities of the columns were variable because the electrolyte concen- trations were variable owing to the buffer degassing procedure during pre--fli ght loading of the columns. The ionic strength was therefore different in each column. The cell mobilities measured in D-1 buffer would therefore not apply under the conditions of the flight experiments. Laboratory values of human and rabbit (and rat, which is similar to human) fixed erythrocytes' mobilities are plotted against ionic strength in Fig. 19, using pre--existing laboratory data. The ionic strengths and conductivities of the media used are shown in Table 11. To enter Fig. 16 to obtain mobilities it was necessary to determine the ionic strengths of the buffers in columns 019 and 049. From their conductivities namely 1.306 and 1.142 mm-ho/cm, respectively, de- termined from Fig. 5, and the plot of F12 vs. K for D-1 in Fig. 17, the ionic strengths of the two columns were estimated to be 0.0237 and 0.0190, respc\u00b0ctively. Front Fig. 15 corrected mobilities are found as given in Table 12. The validity of these mobilities in Che.orbital.experiments is based on the relative insensitivity of mobility to temperature changes. '44 r r.4. t24-14 Table 1.

Droplet sedimentation, another problem encountered in earth- bound experiments, occurs when solute molecule diffusion causes localized density instability of cell containing fluid zones (higher density fluid above lower density fluid which leads to the rapid settling of cell- containing droplets). This limits the cell concentration that can be used. In a microgvavity environment, these two problems are avoided. ,: a Flectrophoretic mobility, p, is defined as the velocity of cells in me- dium per unit electric field; the units are customarily um/sec per volt/cm. Mobilities in different media and temperatures can be compared by making appropriate viscosity corrections. Earlier.space experiments, such as those on Apollo 14, Apollo 16, Skylab 4, and the Apollo- =Soyuz Test Project indicated that separation by electrophoresis was possible in the microgravity environment. Various equipment problems resulted in the design of.another detailed experiment to establish future space bio-The Electrophoresis processing procedure.0 i Equipment Verification Test (EEVT) was flown on Shuttle flight STS-3 in March, 1982. .

The slope of each line gives the slowest, most frequent and i! fastest cells in each band. Although only three points are available: in Figure 4, it appears that the particle velocity was not quite constant in Column 019, apparently due to the formation of a bubble in the column. From these slopes and the electric field calculations, eiectropho.retic mobilities were calculated. The distribution of velocities represents i a mixture of human and rabbit RBC mobilities.

Electrophoretic Mobilities of Cells in Simulation Experiments Electrophoretic mobilities of fixed human RBC's were measured at 12, 14, y 20, and 25\u00b0C in D-I buffer and in D-1 buffer deliberately made at 1,25 times its normal concentration. Thus the laboratory.simulation experi- ments covered the ranges of temperature, viscosity, conductivity, and ionic strength that occurred in the flight experiments.

STS-3 Paul Todd and.Stellan Hierten Institute of Biochemistry, Biomedical Research Centre, University of Uppsala, Box 576, S-751 23 Uppsala, Sweden Two experiments had been performed on U. S. Space Shuttle flight STS-3 to test the hypothesis that in nicrogravity cell-cell interactions do not compromise the separability ar modify the electrophoreti.c mobility of anLial cells at very high concentrations. Fixed human and rabbit erythrocytes were observed to migrate at constant velocity for 1 hr, but densitometer scans of photographs of caltu.: ns in which cells were. migrating did not demonstrate a distinct separation of the two cell types, although-thex leading edge of the cell band, presumably human <\u00b5. erythrocytes, migrated at the predicted velocity (Snyder et al., Elea trophoresis...submitted 1984; Sarnoff at al., Adv. Astronaout Sci. 53, 139, 1983). Free zone electrophoresis, in which the rotation of a 3 = i.d. tube counteracts convective flow and sedimentation orthogonal to a hori- zontal electric. field, was used as a method to simulate static column electrophoresis on Shuttle flight STS-3. The electropharetic conditions were simulated as closely as - possible: current density, buffer composition and con- - .. ductivity, temperature, and cell concentrations. The positions of cell zones were determined every 5 min by scanning.spectrophotonetry, and, as in the microgravity experiments, migration rates were found to be constant and independent of cell concentration up to 2 billion cells /=1. Zone broadening due to increased cell concentration was found to be negligible relative to that due to eleatro- phonetic heterogeneity. An unequal concentration. of the two cell types and the .introduction of a small amount of electroosmosis at the chamber wall resulted, after 1 hr of electrophoresis, in a: band of mixed cells identical to that found in a microgravity e:cperi.:.ent an STS-3..

Test particles (fixed human and rabbit erythrocytes) migrated as expected in a static column and test macromolecules {human serum albumin, ovalbumin, hemoglobin. A, and Pneumococcus polysaccharide 6B} migrated as expected in a continuous flow apparatus. The concentrations studied exceeded those that can be used in free-fluid separation and purifica- tion processes at unit gravity. ' Free-fluid preparative electrophoresis, which is capable. of processing higher concentrations of separands than gel electrophoresis, can be performed. in a static vertical column with or without a density gradient, a vertically- }flowing chamber, a horizontally-flowing chamber with a density gradient, an annular cylindrial chamber in a magnetic .. field, or a horizontal rotating tube W. Considerable effort has gone into designing these devices to function at f maximum sample capacity within the limits imposed by zone sedimentation.and convection, two gravity-dependent processes. Protein solutions of about 0.5% and cell. suspensions of .about 10 7 cells/ml appear to be the maximum usable. concentrations. Preparative electrophoresis experiments using test mixtures were .therefore performed in the absence of gravity using a static .column for cell. electro horesis 2 r . p {) {Fig,- 1a) and a flaw separator electrophoretic.studies on . biological. macromolecule mixtures (Fig.. lb). A .test particle mixture consisting of farma.ldehycie-fixed {3} human and rabbit erythrocytes, 0.5 .x 109 each/ml was used to simulate the electrophoresis 0.. of. biological cell suspensions at high concentrations. This concentration had ,,^ ^.NNWts t 4\u00b0be&,deinon!ftrated to exceed the zone sedimentation limit at unit gravity (4) , 4-R, and the mobilities of the cells had been determined in the buffer D-1 used iaz the apparatus depicted in Figure Ia. Table I. compares the electrophoresic mobilities of the two test particles measured in the laboratory by microscopic analytical electrophoresis (5) with the mobilities of the leading and trailing edges of migrating cells determined by dividing their velocities, measured from photographs taken every Il minutes by the STS--3 astronauts (6), by the monitored field strength, also in the photographs, of 13.5 v/cm. The mobilities are the same in microgravity at a concentration of 10 9 cells/ml as trait gravity at a concentration of 10 6 cells/ml. i A test mixture of ovalbumin and rat serum albumin at a total protein concentration of 16% was used to simulate the electrophoresic purification of a biological protein mixture. This concentration is more than 40 times the zone sedimentation limit in the apparatus of Figure lb when operated at unit gravity and in more conventional downward-flowing continuous electrophoretic separators. Figure 2a contains the electrophoretxc profiles of fractions collected at 1--g and a concentration of o.2% and the profile of fractions collected at Q-g and a concentration of 25% total protein plotted on the same scale. The two profiles are approximately the same despite an 80--fold concen- tration difference. The field strength in the 0-g experiment was twice as great, and the chamber thickness was twice that on the ground.. The efzective- ness of the separation is illustrated in Figure.2b. - A test mixture of human hemoglobin A (7) and Pneumocuccus polysaccharide 6B, a potential vaccine material (8) at concentrations of 22 and 4%, respectively, were used to simulate the electrophoresis of a crude biological supernatant. These concentrations eculd not be used stably in a commercial continuous-flow electrophoretic separator (9).

The results obtained indicate that F such high concentrations of cells, protein mixtures, and protein.--p oly.sacchar.ide rl mixtures can he handled in a microgravity separator. 1 Robert S.

The volume of the su .spension was about 1.0 ml, and it was rotate.d at about 70 rpm at 5. degrees C in a tuberculin syringe to prevent sedimentation and attachment.

Viability and yield of human embryonic kidney cells subjected to flight handling procedures A preliminary test (Experiment 1505) of the holding procedure was made using HFK--34(P2) cells. After trypsinisation they were held at 4 degrees C and rotated in plastic centrifuge tubes at 15 rpm. Samples were evaluated at 24, 48, and 72 hours. The suspending medium was CFES buffer with 5% dialysed horse serum. The results were as follows: HOURS PER CENT PER CENT AT 4 DEG YIELD VIABILITY -------- -------- ---------- 24 72.2 100 4B 65.4 100 72 62.0 74 Continued research with this call strain showed that 10% serum was slightly better than 5%, that passage through CFES buffer without serum,, as in electrophoresis experiments, reduced viability to 84% immediately and to 66% after the cells spent an additional 2 days in suspension in receiving medium. The results of the combined viability-mobility experiment 1520 are given in Table 5, in which the mobility is given in water at 6 degrees. See 1520F for values in CFES buffer. CONCLUSIONS AMID RECOMMENDATIONS In general, the procedure for cell handling and electrophoresis of HEK-8514 cells in 1st or 2nd passage on STS-8 is acceptable if executed properly. Tile CFES buffer has ionic strength that is barely compatible with cell viability and membrane stability, as seen in experiments with human erythrocytes and trypan-blue staining of human kidney cells. Cells suspended in 10% dialysed horse serum for 3 days in the cold appear to be more stable than freshly trypsinized calls. 10% horse serum appears to be superior to 5% horse serum for this purpose. The mean absolute raw mobility of REK -8514 cells in CFES buffer at 6 degrees, conductivity 0.055 mmholcm, is 1.1 - 1.4 um-cmtV-\u00bbsea, with a range of nearly a whole mobility unit. The above-doseribed pretreatment has the effect of raising the EPH of these cells, but electrophoretic heterogeneity dogs not seem to be affected. Receiving medium consisting of 4X-5% P-12113MEM (ingredients but not salts) and 20-40% serum initial concentration appears suitable; it yields about 80% viability in 2 days post treatment relative to initial post-treatment viability. It would seem reasonable to proceed with the following plan\" 1.Trypsinize cells in the ground, suspend in 10% dialysed horse for calf) serum in CFES buffer, as close to 4 deg C is possible, from just prior to launch to just prior to electrophoresis. 2.Inject sample, which will have a slight conductance gap due to the serum, into the chamber with ET consistent with mobility range i.0 -- 1.4.

Suspensions of cultured primary human embryonic kidney .cells were subjected to continuous flow electrophoresis on Space Shuttle.fl.ight STS-8.

Individual fractions were'' ' successfully cultured after return from orbit, and they were found to differ substantially from: 'one'another and from the starting sample with-respect to all of these properties.

Electrophoretic separation proceded Shuttle slight STS -8'in electrophoresis buffer without serum in the McDonnell.- continuous flow ti electrophoretic separator (CFES) :and fractions Were collected into sample bags containing culture medium and concentrated serum. Two separations were performed, designated #3 and A, and subsequent culturing and biochemical . measurements were conducted at Johnson: Space 'Center. Fractions that yielded enough progeny cells were analysed at The Pennsylvania State University for morphology by phase-conttast'microscopy and flour cytometry, and electrophoretic mobility distributions were determined with a Zeiss \"Cytopherometer\" /2,3f. Not all fractions were available for these analyses. Additional experimental 071 details are given in the preceding paper /1./. -RESULTS:1 The electrophoretic mobility\"(EPM) of the starting cell population was found tos be -1.47 +or- 0.27 um-cm/V-s by analytical microscopic electrophoresis using the space electrophoresis buffer.

Fractions were collected : 0.8 min apart, and the cell stream was directed at ;Fraction 59 in the. :absence of the electric field.; therefore about 95% of the cells should have been distributed between fractions 80.--102.

TO i6IDNEY CELL SURTI Goolsby and M. Elaine Kunze 0Introduction. Scattered light measurements in flo g cytometr y have been successfully used to distinguish cells on the basis of differing morphology and internal. structure (6,9,36,37,52,62,64,65,71-73,75,84). Differences in scattered light patterns due to changes in internal stucture would be .expected to occur at large scattering angles. At these angles refraction and reflection from internal cellular structures would be expected to be.larger, compared to overall cellular scattered intensity, than at low scattering angles (33). One of the most widely used methods based on internal structural differences is the discrimination of different cell types from human peripheral blood. Based on narrow forward angle and 90\u00b0 scattered light measurements human leu=kocytes are seperated into lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes (6,73) with the 90' scattered light signal incrEasing in that order corresponding to increasing internal structure. Visser et al (84) seperated mouse bane marrow cells into 4 groups based on a 1\u00b0 versus 90 0 scattered light measurement and found that the cells with the most complex of i_,iternal structure had the highest 90 scattered intensity. Loken et al (52) by neasuring scattered light in the 2 -8 interval were able to sort cells into red blood cells, small lymphocytes, large lymphocytes and polymorphnuclear leukocytes. By measuring the scattered light intensity in 32 angular regions between 0 0 and 306 Salzman et al (71,72) were able to distin guish invasive carcinoma cells from normal cells of the human uterine cervix. Jensen (37) used 90' scattered light to differentiate between leukocytes and squamous cells in gynecologic samples. Measurements of scattered intensity in 32 angular intervals between 0\u00b0and 210 by Price et al (64) der onstrated that two cell types whose intensity patterns were indistinguishable over certain angular intervals were easily separable at others. Jamieson et al (36) and Schafer et al (75) found that fibroblasts from a patient with Snadhofi's disease had a higher scattered light intensity in the 4\u00b0 to 14\u00b0 region than did normal human skin fibroblast lines. This increased intensity was believed to arise from increased cytoplasmic inclusions. Benson et a1 (9) investigated tuiaor cell heterogenity and developed an index of tumor aggressiveness based on 70\u00b0-- 110 1 and 2\u00b0-25\u00b0 scattered 'Light n easurements. They found that increases in the 70\u00b0-110\u00b0 measurement correlated with the degree of roundness of the nucleus. Theoretical treatments of morphology and internal structure have been limited (3,42,43). In the present study.we propose to investigate the effects of internal structure on light scattering in a more simplistic manner than used in previous treatments. By comparing the angular distribution of the scattered light intensity from spheres that are small compared with the size of a cell (\"granules\") with the scattered light intensity* from a whole cell, we have attempted to predict the optintit angular regions in whicl. to detect granulation and other internal structures. Kidney cells Cultured cells of embryonic human kidney origin are.not as well characterized in terms of their internal structure. There exist fiche n or.cell types with differing morphologies. Photomicrographs of these different: cell types are shown in Figure 1. .The small and large epithelial cells are between 8 and 12 jAm and 14 and 20 on, respectively, when in suspension. The domed cells are similar in size to the large epithelial cells and form hemispherical domes... above the substratum when inin culture Tile fenestrated cells are also of similar size to the large epithelial cells and in culture develop with \"holes\" which4 :-1 I i30-2 penetrate ,through,-through, (cytoplasm cells are an: the .aiuii^ to 'I,. size range. In addition, when the cells are viewed in suspension by phase contrast microsco py there are `large refractive cytoplasmic inclusions although they do not appear to be associated with .any particular cell type. Even though no details of internal structural differences are Icnown, the expression of different morphologies in culture should be indicative of differing internal structure. In addition different cultures are known to produce differing amounts of the proteolytic enzyme, urokinase,. a plasminogen activator. This differential production of urokinase is an indication of different degrees of differentiation in the different cultures and might be reflected in differing morphologies or'interna.I structure (10). Even in those cases, such as the Iddney, where the mcrphological and structural differences are. less distinct than in the pit uitax \u00b0\"scattered light measurements should still.be able to distinguish different cell types. \"iaterials and 'Methods. Numerical Procedures. Intracellular granules were modeled as homogeneous spheres and cells were mod.el:ed, as coated spheres. All scattered light distributions were calculated using !lie theory (15,55). The homogeneous and coated sphere calculations were. carried out using the routines, \"BIMNIE\" and \"COAT\" (15), respectively, Additional routines for calculating and plotting the results were written in Fortran IV as . and utilizied the above programs as callable subroutines. The integrations contained in Tables 2-5 were performed by Simpson 's rule. All calculations were carried, out on the II;. System 370 Model. 3033 computer at the Pennsylvaiiia State University. . ingular distributions of scattered light were calculated for granules (homogeneous spheres ). with diameters of 200, 300, 400, 600, 1000 . and 1400 nm. Sizes and II/C ratios of cells (coated spheres) calculated were the same as in Chapter 4. All calculations were carried out for an incident wavelength of 488 nm. The index of refraction of the. core and coat in the coated sphere cell model were the same as those used in Chapter 4. Two indices of refraction were chosen for the granules.. An inde x of refraction of 1. 392 was used to simulate lysosonal type inclusions (300, 600, 1000, and 1400 n n.) which were assumed to have an index. of refraction similar to that of the nucleus. An index of refraction of 1,459 was used to simulate granules which contain: predominately protein, such as the granules of the pituitary. Protein crystals are known to contain 20. to TOQ, water by volume (12). This implies that protein crystals are 301 to :sQ\u00b0oprotein. The dry freight density of proteins is between 1.05 and 1.20 (12). The specif ic refractive' increment, dnidc, is nearly constant for all proteins and has a mean Value of 0.0018 (12,54). Assuming a value of 60% protein and a dry height (tensity of 1 .15 in a typical granule gives an index of refraction 'of 1.4596 EPICS V cell sorter -odifications Two the :Inc. (Hial_eah Florida) .

In-Figure 2.the scattered.light intensity versus Scatte ring angle is plotted for a 12lam sphere (\"cell\") with a 6 m. core (\"nucleus\") and for 4 small homogeneous .spheres (\"granules\") with an index of refraction of . 1.392 using an incident wavelength of 488 nrm. For scattering angles between 10 and 40. the scatter.ed.light Intens ity from a \"granule\" is about:10 --0.05 that of the light scattered from a \"cell\".._fit higher or lower scattering angles the \"Granule\" and \"cellular\" scattered intensities differ by as much as a >7illionWfold. It should be zzoted that the coincident mainiraa in granule scatter occuring. between :50\u00b0and 60 0 and between 115' and 135' is probably not due to a monotonic behavior of the scattered light intensity with granule size but rather occurs due.to the even seperation between granule sizes chosen for calculation. I Jhen this even seperation is broken, as in the case of the 300n. \"granule\",. .other sizes would have their maxima and minima in these regions, . respectively. Certainly.the:conclusion from this graph is that unlike the case for gold particle scattering the scattering angles greater than 600 nay not neccessarily Sae the optirmum interval. in. which to :detect granulation or internal structure in cells.

Elaine Kunze z, Charles Goolsby', Paul Todd', 'Dennis Morrison z, and Marian bewi92 1Al Laboratory, The Pennsylvania State University, University.Park., LEA 1.6802 ZSD5JBigprocessing Laboratory, L. B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX 77058 The ma=alian kidney contains cells that transport water, convert vitamin, D to active forms, synthesize hormones such as renisi and. erythro poietin, and produce enzymes such as urokinase, a plasminogen activator. Several of these functions are maintained by human embryonic kidney cells (HEK) cultivated in vitro. 'Biochemical study of these functions in their individual cell types in vitro .requires purified pop ulations of cells. Light-scattering activated cell sorting (LAOS) was explored as a means \"j of achieving such purifications. It was found that HEK cells at the first ^:- 1-5 passages in culture were heterogeneous with respect.to 2-parameter light scattering intensity distributions,. in which combined measurements included forward angle scattering (2.5-19\u00b0), 90\u00b0 scattering, and time-of- flight size measurements. Size was measured at a resolution of 0.15 Vmf. channel in 256 channels using pulse-height independent pulse- width measure- meat's.. Two-parameter distributions combining these measurements were obtained for HEK cell sub.popul.ations that had been purified by miarogravity electrophoresis and subsequently propagated in culture. These distribu- tions. contained at least 3 subpopulations in all purified fractions, and results of experiments with prepurified cultured HEK cells indicated that subpopulatioris of living cells that were high in plasminogen-activator activity also contained the highest per cent of cells with high 907 light scatter intensity. (Supported by National Aeronautics and Space Administration contract NAS 9-15584.),W:1 31-2 INTRODUCTION Cultured human kidney cells produce several products, such as renin, erythropoietin, vitamin D enzymes, urokinase (UK) and tissue plasminogen activator (TPA). This study focuses on flow cytometric analyses of fractions of cells obtained in an attempt to purify cells producing ..UK and TPA by microgravity electrophoresis. As there are four morphological subpopulationis easily identified_in cultures of human embryonic kidney cells (HEK) (domed, fenestrated, and large and small epithelioid cells) different types of cells should exhibit different light scatter properties. Electrophoretically separated kidney cells were therefore analysed on the EPICS V cell sorter to attempt to identify the various morphological types and to attempt to relate morphology to enzyme production. MATERIALS AND METHODS HEK cells obtained from MA Bioproducts were put into a single cell suspension rising 0..'057 trypsin.and 0.377 EDTA in saline A EPICS V cell sorter. Two-parameter 488nm light scatter distributions were obtained (forward angle light scatter and 90 deg integrated light scatter pulse) as well as 90-degree pulse-width \"time-of-flight\" for cell sizing. Two- parameter distributions combining these measurements were obtained for HEK cell subpopulations that had been purified by mi,crogravity electrophoresis and subsequently propagated in culture. HEK cells were purified by microgravity electrophoresis on space shuttle flight STS-8 (Barlow et al .., 1985). Counts of viable cells were made on each sample. The cells were then plated for propagation in tissue culture.^^ After allowing time for attachment and flattening, the medium was replaced with urokinase production medium .(UKPM), and after several days the amount of urokinase per sample was determined. The resulting distribution of .urokinase: production among fractions ., together with the number of viable cells in each fraction, is shown : in Figure 3. Several fractions were further propagated, and the per cent of each morphological cell type was determined by phase contrast counting of 200 cells in each fraction.. RESULTS The size measuring capability of the EPICS V sorter, which is a pulse height independent measure of pulse width using the unintegrated 90-degree light scatter signal (time of flight),was calibrated with different sizes of microspheres, and a resolution of 0.45 um/channel was obtained, as shown. in Figure I* Microscopic measurements of HEK cells were also performed using 9.5 um, 14.5 um and 20,5 um microspheres as standards. These results are shown in Figure 2, where it is seen that the majority of these passage-1 HEK cells are between 15 and 25 um in diameter. The integrated 90-degree light scatter signal intensity reflects the internal structure of the cell, including granulation (Goolsby, Kunze and'Todd, 1985), nuclear size (Bruns.ting.and Mullaney, 1973), and shape:(Latimer, 1978). Granular cells should scatter more light at 90-degrees than non-granular cells. Forward angle l.ight-scatter. (2.5-19 degrees) is a measure of size and refractive index in live cells (Leary, Notter and Todd, 1:978; Goolsby and'Todd, 1985). Cells with a high refractive index hate, r-duced. forward angle. light intensity. Single cell suspensioiis of these fractions were analyzed on the EPICS VE R 420C 150 Uj100^V 5031-3 T^'y cell scatter vs time--of- -flight, integrated 90-degree light scatter vs foward angle light scatter, and integrated 90--degree light scatter vs peak 90 -degrree light scatter were acquired. Two examples of these distributions are shown in Figure 4. Each distribution was divided into four regioxxs (Figure 5), and the percentage of cells in each region was determined for each fraction (Figure 6). . A selected portion of these results, along with the uarokinase plus tissue plasminogen activator activity and the morphological observations are shown in the 3 graphs of Figure 7. DISCUSSION Results of these flow cytometrie. light scattering experiments with prepurified cultured human kidney cells indicate that subpopulations of living cells that were high in plasminogen activator activity also contained the highest percentage of cells with high 90-degree light scatter intensity.64 \" 5 W Nsome co C' 0 1 18 W 2 60 Z 0 0 m 40 z.

Two dimensional display by the principal components method 193 The principal components method is to project the b dimensions onto ewer- axes which represent independent variables that give the structure of the ori ginal variables in an opimal, way by using the covariance warrix to eliminate the redundant information in the correlation matrix.. This is accomplished first by determinin g the mean channel zj for each parameter: tiM ^J=1/rrsX.i.j (5) and the standard deviation 5.j: (b) and the correlation matrix R(L,J) can be defined as follows covariace matrix, and Ift cljwz/(m--f)XZ (ail\u2014z.i)X(zi.j--z.j) (7)t The principal component analysis is also ca.l 1 ed ei genvector analysis. The correlation matrix R can be considered as a linear transformation that transforms a vector '27.j into a new vector ii..i in such a way that Lhe cells are represented by a new set of variables, each of which is a combination of the original variables\u2014This transformation e.an be wr \u2014A=?r^ Ft. v = X v372-7 (10)OWQMW PAM .19 OF POOR QuAL17Y rr he X s reflect 'the properties of the correlation matrix R , which contain the variations of original data and the eigenvector are the pro- jections of original variables, so that U =v o z, 3 The U.k are called principal components, each of which is a linear- con- bination of the original values of the parametres, and the first two of which can ba considered as axes, U r. 1 , U.2.

RESULTS The program tested against the published data The pi.ebl i shed data 1113 is used to test our program. The results of clustering are shown in Fig.l,which is rased on the principal component ttts method in 2-dimensional space, The 14 kinds of milk can be identified into 2,3, or 14 groups accordin g to their fatty acids in it.

In the Fig.l, the number is the sequence number of fatty acid, the asterisks represent the positions of the centraids which were calculated in the FU-dimensional space.In egneral, if the group construction of the data ie distinct it is convenient to search the clusters within the distance matrix: in n-dimensional space directly without repre.dicting the centroids from --dimensional display. On the contrary, the graphs of 2--dimensional iii=_play can be used to. determine 32_11 OF POOR QUALITY. satisfactory coincidence with each other: the search for the centroids y calculation in n-dimensional space orientate in the centre positions of the membership of -the cluster in 2-dimensional display; and the best 4-group cluster (see Fable 1) is the same as the display (#2 and #10 are far from the others, e.s.,their properties are very different from these ai the ethers, they should be a cl uster individually, respectively.

The position occupied by the number depends on the Properties Qf cells. In i. other- words, the properties of cells determi ne riot only the density of .. ints in clusters, but the distance between the dusters. As a conse- quence, the properties of clusters can illustrate the extend of success >. of the experiment. To test the cluster with A(I,J) in combination with the distributions im {:32 \u2014 1 I of Fig.: and to evaluate the clustering,the numerical data are needed.For \u00b1 each of various putative clusters,the distribution of membership is consi- dered as normal. The mean can be regarded as the centroid, the orienta- tions of which can be pridicated on the address matrix:, based on the re- lative frequency distributions of the first two principal components. If the objects are grouped into two clusters, the 19th interval of the Or-- Est principal component can be considered as the boundary. The frequency distribution of the second can be considered as in equal probability proximately. As a result, the centroids are located at the A(9,20) and 026,20) respectively. The distance between the centroids is 1.70. The width oT clusters can be expressed by the avera ge area which is occupied by each of objects in the cluster, or by the density of the objects in - the sluster.Similarly, the cent.roids distributions between the centraids and densities can be calculated -For the case of the 3-group cluster and the 4--group cluster. The results are shown in Table 4.

The result is coincidence with flow cytometry. Finally, the requirement in cluster analysis is capable of characte- rizing the clustered populations on the basis of their propaxrties. There- fore,the application of clustering techniques to the field of flow cyto- metry can give us information on which calls behave in a similar manner and what parameters they possess in common.

DICUSSION Di++erent methods o+ testing Cluster [12 -11 are used by different inves s- tigators. The width of clusters and -the distance between the centroids are preferable. BUt, the parameters of ClUStering procedure are not al- ' ways appropriate to evaluate th p different clusters with different mor- pholo gy in the parameters space, and to appreciate the differences of classification, from which tF,e best group cluster can be obtained. We used the average distance between objects instead of the largest distance which is considered as the width of 1-he cluster. For example, in iden- tifying the fatty acid in milk, we found thmt the 4-group cluster is the best confiquration o-F ^he objects and the #2 amd #10 are considered as two individual subc1uster5.For the flow cytometry experiment,the data is in a list-mode,the result of cIustering 55 cells which were selected at random is not the same as thaL of the 1360 cells': 2-group cluster is the best for the iormer and 3-group cluster for the latter because Of statiis- tics.Though our method of testing clusters which is based on the relative frequency distribution of principal component requires as many objects as possible to accquire good statistical properties, it needs much smaller computer space and shorter computation time than that the distance matrix wethod, which asks for at l gast 20001--.'.
