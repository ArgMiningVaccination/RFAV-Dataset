Cases have increased dramatically since the arrival of the Delta variant.", "sitename": "Hennepin Healthcare", "date": "2021-11-11", "cleaned_text": "Exciting news and milestone: COVID vaccines available for children ages 5-11 years Recently, the Federal Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control approved and recommended the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for children 5-11 years old, taking us one step closer to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Too many children have been infected with COVID-19 and serious cases can occur even in healthy children. Cases have increased dramatically since the arrival of the Delta variant. Nationally, over 1.9 million 5-11 year-olds have been infected and more than 8,300 hospitalized with COVID-19. Some children can also have long-term health effects, and COVID-19 is now a leading cause of death for this age group. Vaccination is our best hope to end the current pandemic. It protects our children, families, and community. If you are a grandparent, parent or guardian, get your children vaccinated and share these facts with others: - The vaccine is safe and highly effective! - Getting our children vaccinated helps them stay safe during school, sports, and other activities, and it slows the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. - Children who are fully vaccinated do not have to stay home (quarantine) if they are exposed to someone with COVID-19, and they do not have to get tested as often. The vaccine is available at our [Brooklyn Park](https://www.hennepinhealthcare.org/clinic/brooklyn-park-clinic/), [Richfield](https://www.hennepinhealthcare.org/clinic/richfield-clinic-and-pharmacy/), and [Whittier](https://www.hennepinhealthcare.org/clinic/whittier-clinic-and-pharmacy/) clinics and the downtown [Clinic & Specialty Center](https://www.hennepinhealthcare.org/clinic/clinic-and-specialty-center/). Frequently Asked Questions - How can I schedule an appointment? Call [612-873-6963](tel:612-873-6963)to make an appointment. - Are there walk-ins? No, at this time we are only taking appointments. - Are there extended hours (evenings and weekends) available? There will be no extended hours at Brooklyn Park, Richfield, and Whittier clinics. However, there will be extended hours at the Clinic & Specialty Center on Thursday, November 11. We will continue to monitor community demand and staff capacity and communicate availability as best as we can. - My child or grandchild is not an established patient with Hennepin Healthcare. Can I make an appointment for them? Yes, we can accommodate children who do not get their care with us. Our sites are approved MDH vaccine sites, which means you will not get a bill even if our clinic is out of your network. The vaccine is free, and we welcome all. - If my child had COVID, can they still get vaccinated? Yes, data from the studies of the COVID-19 vaccine in children indicate that it can safely be given to children who have had a previous COVID infection. - If my child recently had their flu shot or another childhood vaccine, can they still get their COVID-19 vaccine? Yes, there are no contraindications and, in fact, the COVID-19 vaccine can be given at the same time as other vaccines. - I still have questions about the vaccine, who can I talk to? Reach out to your provider or care team. - Where can I get more information about vaccines for children? Visit the [State of Minnesota site](https://mn.gov/covid19/vaccine/vaxforkids/)for the latest information on vaccines for children and teens.
