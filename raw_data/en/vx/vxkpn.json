Headlines and celebrities talked about how supplements like vitamin C, zinc, green tea and echinacea boost the immune system and protect against the virus. But while dietary supplements can help to support a healthy immune system, whether specific supplements might be associated with a lower risk of catching SARS-CoV-2 isn't really known. Regardless, supplement sales soared last year. In the U.S. during the first week of the pandemic sales of dietary supplements skyrocketed to [more than 35%](https://www.nutritionaloutlook.com/view/dietary-supplement-sales-skyrocket-during-coronavirus-pandemic). And the trend wasn't isolated to America. Before the first 'lockdown' in the U.K. sales for vitamin C rose by 110% and multivitamins rose by 93%. Similarly, zinc supplement sales rose by 415% in the first week of March, at the peak of Covid-19 fears in the U.S. \"Vitamins and supplements, right now in particular, are viewed as a small measure of control that people have over their lives, in a really uncertain time,\" said Joan Driggs, Vice President of Content and Thought Leadership at IRI, in an [interview back in April 2020](https://www.nutritionaloutlook.com/view/dietary-supplement-sales-skyrocket-during-coronavirus-pandemic). \"There's a lot of anxiety. There's a lot of the unknown. People don't know how this is going to shake out. They don't know how long it will take to shake out. So, they're looking for a little bit of control and taking things like vitamins and supplements to maybe shore up their immunity or keep themselves healthy. It's what they're doing to help keep themselves safe.\" And while there was [some evidence](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/he/2021/02/covid-19-rapid-review-vitamin-d.pdf?la=en) to suggest supplements like [vitamin D](https://www.forbes.com/sites/victoriaforster/2020/10/27/8-in-10-hospitalized-covid-19-coronavirus-patients-were-vitamin-d-deficient-new-study/?sh=7305bba66ec1) could help reduce the risk of testing positive for Covid-19, it's remained controversial. \"We know that a range of micronutrients, including vitamin D, are essential for a healthy functioning immune system. This, in turn, is key to prevention of, and recovery from, infections. \"But to date, there is little convincing evidence that taking nutritional supplements has any therapeutic value beyond maintaining the body's normal immune response,\" said Sumantra Ray, Executive Director, NNEdPro Global Centre for Nutrition and Health, in a statement. However, a new study published today in the journal [BMJ Nutrition Prevention & Health](https://nutrition.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bmjnph-2021-000250) might shed some new light on this controversial topic. The study, which looked at self-reported data from 445,850 people from the U.S., U.K. and Sweden, found that taking multivitamins, omega-3, probiotics or vitamin D supplements may lessen the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. But taking vitamin C, zinc, or garlic supplements did nothing to reduce the risk of catching Covid-19. The study used data from adult users of the [Covid-19 Symptom Study app](https://covid.joinzoe.com/data) to see if regular supplement users were less likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2. When looking at the U.K. users they found that around 47% took vitamins regularly while just over 50% didn't. Approximately 6% of the people in the study tested positive during the study. The researchers found that those who took probiotics, omega-3 fatty acids, multivitamins or vitamin D had of SARS-CoV-2 infection: by 14%, 12%, 13% and 9%, respectively. But they only noticed this effect in women. No such clear associations were seen in men. This was also after accounting for potentially influential factors, including underlying conditions and usual diet. Meanwhile, the researchers found no protective factors for those taking vitamin C, zinc, or garlic supplements. They also looked at the U.S. and Swedish app users and found the same overall patterns. The equivalent figures for the U.S. and Sweden were a reduced risk of:18% and 37%, respectively for multivitamins; and 24% and 19%, respectively, for vitamin D supplements. However, while the results show a modest but significant impact on Covid-19 risk, it's worth noting that this research is observational and relied on self-reported data from a self-selected group without collecting information on dosage or ingredients, so any conclusion are correlational at best. \"This study wasn't primarily designed to answer questions about the role of nutritional supplements in Covid-19. This is still an emerging area of research that warrants further rigorous study before firm conclusions can be drawn about whether specific nutritional supplements might lessen the risk of Covid-19 infection,\" cautioned Ray. There is currently no guidance on the use of micronutrient supplements, such as vitamins D and C and zinc, as a treatment for COVID-19, according to the [World "}
