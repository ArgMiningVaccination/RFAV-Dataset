I can call at any time and ask any question, even when I go into the pharmacy and ask questions or need help. I am always treated like I'm a family member. I trust everyone there to help me with whatever I need. In short: knowledgeable, professional, friendly staff. They're never too busy to answer questions. For a small hometown pharmacy, they are very well-stocked to meet a variety of service - from medications, OTC, medical supplies, homeopathic, supplements and I could go on. Oh, let's not forget a good supply of cards and gifts items! Amazingly kind and helpful staff. An example of perfection for any local business to model itself on if it needs tips on customer service and a warm environment.
