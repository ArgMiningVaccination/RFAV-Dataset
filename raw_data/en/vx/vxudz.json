Toxins prevent optimal functioning from the cellular level up to the whole body's function. According to a report published by the EPA, over 7 billion pounds of toxic waste, containing 8000 different toxins, have been released into the environment, polluting our food, water, and air. Bodies that are overloaded with toxins do not function optimally. Toxins can accumulate in the liver, kidneys, large intestine, lungs, skin, lymph, blood, and even individual cells. Toxins can cause your skin to be dull and lifeless, and cause acne, rashes, inflammatory lesions, and other skin problems. Toxins can cause numerous problems in the body such as gas, bloating, constipation, headaches, fatigue, weight gain, bad breath, body odor, joint pain, poor memory, and concentration. Research has linked toxin exposure to liver disease, some types of cancer, and obesity. We detoxify our bodies! Proper detoxification eliminates toxins and provides building blocks for repair.

Maybe you are tired more easily and need more sleep, or don't have as much endurance as you once had. Do you get sick more often? Does it take you longer to get over a cold or the flu? Older bodies get hit harder with viruses and bacterial infections than they once did. As we age, our [immune systems](/auto-immune-function.html) get tired. They don't respond as quickly and completely, leaving us more susceptible to illness. Your immune system is made up of cells, tissues, organs, and fluids that act together to keep you healthy. White blood cells are the primary warriors within the system. There are many active cell types, but there are two main cell types called phagocytes and lymphocytes. Phagocytes attack and kill invaders like viruses and bacteria. B-Lymphocytes tag invaders for destruction and remember what the invaders look like so that the next time the body is presented with the same virus, T-Lymphocytes can act immediately, and you won't get sick. B-Lymphocytes also neutralize toxins and mark abnormal cells, like cancer cells, for death. This process usually keeps you healthy. However, as we age, the system doesn't work as well. There is no better way to protect yourself from germs than to wash your hands! And it's free. So lather up several times a day, even if you don't think your hands are dirty. Our air, food, and water absorb the environment, and so do we. Depending on your location, the tap water can be full of things we don't want. Our air can be full of pollutants, and our food as well. Try filtering your water. It makes it taste better and removes unwanted components. Eat organic foods whenever possible. They lack dangerous pesticides and other harmful chemicals. You can't do much about the air outside, but you can have clean air in your home. An in-home filtration system can clear your air, or you can have lots of plants around to filter and clean the air. Good quality sleep is essential for a healthy immune system. If you aren't getting enough rejuvenating sleep, see your holistic health care practitioner to help you find a natural remedy. Oftentimes, a little melatonin will do the trick. But don't do it alone. Get some professional advice to speed you on your way to good sleep. There are many excellent supplements to enhance the function of your immune system. A tried and true that everyone knows is vitamin C. 1000 mg a day is a good general dose for a little immune system boost. Much higher doses are appropriate when you have a cold or flu. Seek advice from your holistic practitioner about that. Mushrooms have been shown to have excellent benefits for the immune system. There are several types out there, but Turkey Tail is my favorite and has been studied extensively. Two grams a day is a typical dose. Vitamin D is an essential nutrient for a healthy immune system, though it is often forgotten. A very high percentage of the population is deficient in vitamin D, even here in sunny Florida! Effective doses of vitamin D can vary widely. Get tested and keep your levels in the optimal range. Your natural health practitioner can help you with this. Recent research has shown that at least 70 percent of your immune system is located in your intestines. So keep them strong and healthy by eating lots of fruit and vegetables, and taking a broad spectrum, high-quality probiotic. Probiotics feed the good bacteria in your gut and help to protect you from foreign invaders. It's important to get the right strains of quality probiotics. See your natural health practitioner to ensure that you get the right strains and strength for you. As we age, we are not as good at digesting food as we once were. Our digestion is slower and less complete, so we get fewer nutrients from our foods, and less benefit from oral supplements. Intravenous nutrient therapy can dramatically increase nutrient levels and improve the functionality of your immune system. There are several nutrient IV options to optimize your health and recharge your immune system. Intravenous nutrient therapy is nutrient delivery by way of a small needle inserted into the vein for direct delivery of nutrients that packs a substantial punch! [Intravenous vitamin C](/vitamin-c-therapy.html) can increase your circulating vitamin C levels by 70 to 100 times the amount that oral vitamin C can. In times of compromised health, this is a great option. Low doses of intravenous vitamin C can help to keep your immune system robust. [Glutathione](/anti-aging-iv-therapy.html) is the master detoxifier and antioxidant in the body. Every single cell uses glutathione, but it is most active in the liver, where the majority of detoxifying takes place. Remember that the big players in your immune system are white blood cells. Detoxifying protects your body from the assaults of daily living. Glutathione supports every cell in your body and is exceedingly beneficial to your immune system. Unfortunately, oral glutathione just doesn't work. It gets broken down by the digestive process before it gets into your blood. So intravenous is the only way to get it. No, it's not available at the tiki bar! A [Myers' Cocktail](/myers-cocktail.html) is a combination of vitamins and minerals that helps to support the cellular activity of your body. This combination just helps everything work better. In the best-case scenario, only about 40 percent of supplements are absorbed by the body. The Myers' Cocktail gives you 100 percent absorption because it is delivered straight to your bloodstream via intravenous infusion. It's beneficial to everyone, no matter who you are. There are numerous options and benefits of intravenous nutrient therapy. Most conditions can benefit from nutrient IV therapy. Contact Root Causes to find out how Nutrient IV therapy can benefit you! ; The holiday season can be hectic. We have family, friends, and work obligations. We try to squeeze in as much as possible, but there just doesn't seem to be enough time in the day to do it all, so we go to bed later or get up earlier or both. But sleep is not a good compromise. Sleep deprivation suppresses the immune system so you are more likely to catch that cold or flu going around the office. Also, researchers have found that those who don't sleep enough, tend to gain weight. If you're trying to control the extra holiday pounds, giving up an hour of sleep may contribute to your holiday weight gain. If you're having trouble sleeping, try GABA or melatonin for added zzzz's. With so many events happening during the season, it's easy to get over-committed. Try to keep your commitments to a manageable level. Prioritize the events and make sure you leave time to take care of yourself and enjoy yourself. Take some downtime once a week to re-energize. A great stress-releasing pick-me-up is a stop at your holistic health provider for a massage and Myers' Cocktail. You will leave relaxed and energized, ready for the next round of holiday festivities. Christmas cookies, cakes, and candies not only pack on the pounds, but because holiday food is so carbohydrate-packed, we end up reducing protein intake. Low protein intake leads to a loss in muscle mass. Muscle burns calories. Fewer muscle means decreased metabolism and weight gain. Additionally, a lack of amino acids from proteins weakens the immune system, making you more susceptible to colds and flu. Simple carbohydrates break down into sugar. High sugar intake from any source leads to inflammation in the body. Chronic is associated with a host of problems, such as inflammation that weakens the immune system, joint and muscle pain, difficulty concentrating, vascular disease, weight gain, and lack of energy, to name a few. Keep your protein intake up by eating a high-protein meal before you leave the house. Eat foods like fish, grass-fed organic beef or chicken, legumes, and high-protein vegetables. If you just can't get the protein in, stop by your holistic practitioners' office for some high-quality protein powder to use as a supplement. Don't buy the cheap stuff; studies have shown many cheap brands to be full of heavy metals. Don't be in such a hurry that you skip taking your supplements. A multivitamin and a multi-mineral are essential to each of us, especially when we are on the go like we are during the holiday season. Try a few energy-promoting supplements like extra b-complex, D-ribose, and adaptogenic herbs like ashwagandha and ginseng. Take extra vitamins C, D, and zinc to keep your immune system strong. And get intravenous nutrients for power-packed boosts of energy, immune support, and overall health. Stay with your exercise program. Believe it or not, it is easier to keep up than restart. Find a partner to help keep you motivated. Even if you don't have time for your usual routine, make sure that you do something. Walking for just 30 minutes has health benefits. It is so important that we make time to care for ourselves. Take the time to eat right, get enough sleep, exercise, and keep your body healthy. Consider a [hyperbaric oxygen treatment](/hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy.html) twice per month. It's relaxing, reduces inflammation, helps your body rejuvenates, and enhances the immune system on many different levels. Combine a hyperbaric with intravenous nutrients and you will be invincible this holiday season! Helping others makes us happy! Being happy increases the production of \"happy brain chemicals\" such as serotonin, endorphins, phenylethylamine, and ghrelin. Boost your happiness physiology, and someone else's too, by doing something nice. Volunteer somewhere, help someone carry their bags, hold the door, compliment someone on anything. You will both get a boost. And guess what: increased endorphins and serotonin strengthen the immune system! Most important, don't stress! Stress reduces the happiness chemicals and increases bad chemicals like cortisol. High cortisol leads to decreased sleep, weight gain, agitation, depression, and fatigue. Those are all the things we don't want at any time of year, but especially this month. So if you just follow the first seven tips, you will have number eight without even trying!
