If we talk about the three pursuits [Cha.Sa.Sutra Sthana11/3][1] of life, namely desire to live, desire to earn, and desire to have superior position after death, the desire of longevity steals the prime position [Cha.Sa.Sutra Sthana 11/4].[1] Ayurveda advocates this pursuit of prolonging life by promoting the principle of \" preserving the best (health) and fighting the worst(diseases)\" [Cha.Sa.Sutra Sthana 30/26].[1] The world health organization (WHO) focuses on concept of \"Health for All by 2000\" in the agenda of \"sustainable attainable goals:2030\". WHO has been striving hard to lay newer ways of gaining complete health to the population of developed and developing countries. This renaissance of the thought process of individual health has set new dimensions. The concept of \"Health care for the People\" has been intermediated to \" Health care by the People\", as for countries of the highest population and less medical resources, the individual self-care measures can pave a new outlook to reach the sustainable, attainable health goals.[2] No creature is immortal, it is impossible to prevent death, but it is possible to prevent diseases, so one should try for which is preventable. Preventive, promotive, curative, and rehabilitative aspects are the pillars of health care systems. Moreover, if we study these aspects, none other than the principles of Ayurveda grab the pinnacle position. Once we take pain is gaining the 2 | www.symbiohealth.com attention of the masses towards the immortal practice of Ayurveda, the battle towards the concept of attaining complete mental and physical health of the population shall be half won. It is utmost important to globalize the essence of Ayurveda before planning any strategies. Health care system needs new indulgence by mainstreaming Ayurveda as a \"defense strategy\" that implies preventing the core the existence of any diseases by analyzing factors causing them. This could be integrated with the \"offense strategy\" of Modern medicine, which looks after the diagnosis and aggressive management of diseases. 1.Elaborate Health in Ayurveda and Contemporary Medicine A. Ayurveda viewpoint: \"He who has health has hope, he who has hope has everything\" with a natural sense of well being health empowers every costlier asset one can ever preserve. The ancient old science believes in nourishing the concept of longevity [Cha. Sa. Sutra Sthana 1/1][1], seeking proper life [Ash.Hri. Sutra sthana 1/1][3]hence it deals with all four corners of \"good-bad\", \"happy - unhappy\" perspectives of life [Cha. Sa. Sutra sthana 1/41][1]. Let us discuss the various approaches our sages made to make us understand the concept of complete health. a.Holistic view point : Health as per Ayurvedic text is a divine entity which helps in attainment of pious act(dharma), wealth(artha), desire(kaam), salvation( moksha) [Cha. Sa. Sutra Sthana 1/15][1]. Ill health takes away the happiness from life. Disease free body is the best source of wealth, virtue, gratitude. On contrary diseases are destroyers of these sources, wellbeing and life itself [Cha.Sa.Sutra sthana 1/16-17] [1] Happiness prevails in disease free body and getting entangled in any of the disease is defined an unhappy life. [Cha.Sa.Sutra sthana 9/4] [1] For instance we feel the pain with even a minute prick of thorn. The pain due to any harsh verbal conversations equally hit our mind, body and soul. These are also indications of unhealthy, unhappy self. Health is devoid of any of these physical, mental, verbal painful inflictions 3 | www.symbiohealth.com b.Operational definition: A state of homeostasis, a state of dyanamic continuum: Ayurveda states the concept of health as \"the integrity of balance of physiological neuro- chemical regulatory humors (Doshas), tissues ( dhatu) and digestive power responsible for digestion, metabolism and transformation( agni) along with proper reutilized and excreted waste product(mala), which interdependently help to keep normal functions of sensorias (indriya) and ultimately results into spiritual harmony\" [Su. Sa. Sutra sthana 15/41][4] Broadly this equilibrium is manifested by proper functions of all bodily elements like eyes catching their best vision, ears hearing their best sound, skin feeling the best touch, hands holding the best of their catch, legs moving with best of their strength etc. and mind ,soul being content .[Cha.Sa.Sutra sthana 8/12][1] The aged old observational study of Ayurveda is a compilation of clinically collected data which validates to be more operational in contemporary era. Assessing health profile by mere assessing few of the things had been beautifully jotted by our sages. Like, timely desire for food and its easy digestion. All the natural urges that bind our body are properly evacuated. Attainment of sound sleep. These things make us feel light, active, energetic, peppy in every work. Even the outer complexion of our body defines our healthy self for instance a pale look in fever, hot flushes in menopausal age, yellowish skin in jaundice etc.[5] With the tag line \"Happy we go, healthy we live \" Ayurvedic treatise explain a unique concept of happy content life( sukh ayu ) and benevolent life( hita ayu).[Cha.Sa.Sutra sthana 30/24][1] Materialistic quality health assessment scale Enjoying favourite delicacies, wandering favourite places, endowed with youth , enthusiasm , strength , virility , knowledge of arts, sciences , riches , object sense etc complete happy life and vice versa is termed unhappy life. Holistic quality health assessment scale: Whereas the life will become benevolent ( hita ayu) when one devotes oneself in spiritual practice for e.g. charitable in giving best to 4 | www.symbiohealth.com others without a mere sense of jealousy, anger, hatred etc . One who indulge oneself in more of righteous act of love , knowledge, service are meant to lead a much content disease free healthy life. B. Contemporary medicine view point a. World health organization definition(1948) Over the years, contemporary Modern medicine has been advocating a proper way of defining \"Health\" and finally unanimously agreed to one. WHO defines \"Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely an absence of disease or infirmity\" this statement has been enhanced by considering the inclusion of \"socially and economically productive life\". [2] Natural calamities, pandemic, financial recession, wars etc all come under the concept of social, environmental and economic status. As an individual has to adjust all these odds for happy and peaceful wellbeing. But again considering all these points it seems unpredictable that if any of the individual fits perfectly to the terminology called \"Complete Health\". Any of the factor whether its bodily disease or mental upset or natural calamities or financial status, are somehow going to affect harmony of mind ,body and environment leading to distortion of the term \"Health\". b.Operational definition of Health[2] WHO definition is unable to measure the term \"Health\" and \"Wellbeing\" hence an operational definition has been adviced which states Health(broad sense) has been seen as a \"condition or quality of human organism expressing adequate functioning of the organism in given condition, genetic or environmental\". Health(narrow sense)means no obvious evidence of disease and proper functioning of organs in accordance with one's age, sex, community and geographic region. So, health is a condition relatively stable but may change as human beings adapt the external or internal stimuli. 5 | www.symbiohealth.com c. Philosophical health[2] Recent years Modern Science has acquired new Philosophy of health as 1. Fundamental right as stated in constitution 2. Essence of productive life, development 3. Responsibility of individual, government, world 4. Central to the concept of quality of life 5. Investment in its maintenance etc. 6. There is a paradigm shift from disease centric goal to patient centric visionary, as combating disease in larger population is an economic burden. C. Traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) and others: Physiology of Chinese medicine revolves in maintaining Yin (inner/negative principles) Yan (outer/positive principles). They believe that illness is caused due to disharmony between the two. Seen from recovery mechanism of organs, Yang functions to protect from outer harm, and Yin is inner base to store and provide energy. For maintaining health yin yang have to function properly and Qi i.e. energy in network of channels can be stimulated by acupuncture6. Homeopathic science, Unani medicines, Siddha also are contemporary in practice and all devote themselves in maintaining the quality of life which is disease free. 2.Components of health in Ayurveda classics and their importance We find or relate the parallels between Ayurveda and Modern Science but Ayurveda do vary in its conceptual part of physiology and so the working of system. Atom, cell, tissue, organ, organ system Dosha,Dhatu,Mala (Modern Science) (Ayurveda) BODY 6 | www.symbiohealth.com Global understanding: For digging deep to the science of Ayurveda, one needs to get familiar with various terminologies which form the baseline of physiological entities to maintain homeostasis in functioning of body elements. Few among them are the above said terms which actually maintain health if balanced and maintain a life span of 100 years. [7] Dosha( humour ):It has been explained as the component essential in origin of human body ,the three doshas (vata, pitta , kapha)are responsible to grow unicellular zygote multicellular systems and equally viable in disturbing the homeostasis of body in their vitiated form hence termed dosha.[Ash.Hri.sutrasthan 1/6-7] [3] Dhatu(tissue): The constitutional entity in Ayurveda which holds, grows and gives support, nourishes and protects body are Dhatu (tissues). They are seven in number and counts the nourishing unit of a human body. Body fluids, blood tissue, muscle tissue, adipose tissue, bone tissue, bone marrow and neurons. Mala: The waste in form of urine, faeces, sweat etc. are counted as mala in Ayurveda. Agni: This constitute the major stimulator in every metabolism process from a complex level to the cellular level. They are 13 in number as per the Ayurvedic literature likewise ignition present as jatharagni( digestive power), dhatwagni (ignition power at tissue level),bhootagni (ignition for more cellular level) .All of them actually relate to the 7 | www.symbiohealth.com homeostasis required in maintaining proper healthy growth of body by taking all the nourishments from the food we eat. Indriya, atma, mana( sensorial entities ):These as a sensorial unit in our body which functions in accordance of peace of bodily organ and their proper functioning. Doshas move in the entire body and carry out functions which are beneficial or hazardous to the body. In balanced state they are responsible for proper nourishment ,strength, luster of skin and in disturbed state they are cause of diseases in body . [Cha.Sa.Sutra sthana 20/9] body( dhatu,mala ) just like columns of house support it or as a tripod which supports the vessel .[Su.S.Sutrasthan 21/3] [4] Doshas can be the healer or of our bodily system.All these entitities (dosha,dhatu,mala ) form the roots of body[Su.Sa. Sutra sthana 15/3] [4] and the stronger the roots, the better is the survival. 3.Practical guidelines for implementing concept of health in todays society: Demographic trends such as urbanization and high prevalence of chronic diseases pose new problems in all countries. Other social, behavioral and biological changes such as increased sedentary lifestyle, resistance to antibiotics, new emerging infections recent Ebola ,SARS viruses threaten the wellbeing of hundreds of people across the world. Greater recognition to Mental Health illness is also needed as the most ignorant state could also damage the health care statistics in future. Similarly, the investments we make in promoting physical, mental, social wellbeing of child and mother will pay greater dividend in future generation . Ayurveda can contribute of the par significance with its fundamental and applied principles in preventing the health of every individual across the globe. There is an earnest need of implementation of these immortal Health principles in Primary and Public Health Care domain. a. Diet: Wholesome food is the sole cause of living being . Consumption of proper amount of food certainly helps the individual in bringing strength, good complexion, happiness and longetivity.[Cha.Sa.Sutra sthana 28/3] [1] None among the most developed contemporary science 8 | www.symbiohealth.com has ever advocated such brilliant pattern of consumption of food depending on seasons, place, constitution of an individual . Little do we think, what has been the turning point of advent of dreadful diseases in mankind, its definitely been the modernization in changing lifestyle, food habits .In demographically varied pattern of country like India, each state has its own way of consuming their staple food. This pattern is actually in accordance with the constitutional pattern of population which helps to maintain health. Even though today South Indian \"Dosas\" are relished in North or the \"Chhole Bhature\" are enjoyed in Southern belts but what makes them unwholesome is its geographical variation. This concludes unwholesome diet becomes more unwholesome if taken in wrong place, with bad food combination, in improper quantity .A self controlled man consuming proper food lives 36000 nights that measures a life span of 100 years.[Cha.Sa.Sutra sthana 27/347] [1] a. Daily regimen and circadian rhythm: The phrase \" early to bed ,early to rise makes you healthy, wealthy and wise\" deals with the foreseen vision of sages of Ayurveda. It emphasizes the need to wake in brahma muhurta [A.Hri.Sutra sthana 2/1][3] i.e the pre-dawn hour. It advocates that for maintenance of health, life one should wake in early hours of morning which is the appropriate to seek knowledge as the alertness is guided by the parallel balance of biological clock and rhythmic clock. Sleep is the investment that binds our health and body together. Humans sleep and wake at fairly constant 24 hours called circadian rhythm . When we attempt to stay awake against schedule dictated in circadian rhythm our mental and physical performances greatly diminish. The most practical example is the employees of IT Sector with all lavish perks suffer from most of the mental and physical ailments due to their changing disturbed lifestyle. Circadian release melatonin ,a hormone from pineal gland. Its release mainly differs by age, sex, light, environment and physiological factors. [8]So the changing pattern disrupts its secretion which speeds up aging, tumor genesis, visceral adiposity and cardiovascular function which are direct signals for advent of many non-communicable hazards like Diabetes, heart diseases, high blood pressure, cancer etc. 9 | www.symbiohealth.com b.Exercise : Ayurvedic view point of the term( vyayam) exercise and( ardhshakti vyayam )half ones capacity to endure exercise has practical proven relevance. Vyayama(exercise ) with due course has been considered as an integral part of Ayurvedic daily regimen with scientifically proven basis of do's and don'ts. It focuses on the fact that regular practice of exercise will result in light feeling, good exercise tolerance, good digestive power , fat reduction ,fit and attractive body .[Ash.Hri.Sutra sthana 2/10] [2] Seasonal recommendation prefers exercising half the capacity of body tolerance in the months of cold seasons and more lesser in other months of hot seasons .[Ash.Hri. Sutra sthana 2/11] [3] The population of extreme ages (children and old groups), one who suffers from recurrent digestive ailments, one who dominates in the body composition of pitta dosha (hot potency body constituition) and [Ash.Hri.Sutra sthana 2/10] [3] It has been proven that moderate exercise loads enhance immune function above sedentary levels, while excessive amounts of prolonged high intensity exercise may impair immune functions. Exercise has anti inflammatory effects, it reduces c-reactive protein but when done in moderate amount. With similar view point researches on athletes, sedentary subjects and women prove that intense amount of exercise may increase the risk of infections. [9] So right amount of exercise will give right result. Yoga is preferred when comes to strengthening mind, body and soul. d.Seasonal Panchakarma for health: Who would have ever thought that cold of December would make you ill in February ? This is the seasonal variation that has impact on our health and occurrence of diseases. The heat in February makes the accumulated kaph dosha in winters to dilute leading to diseases .[Su.Sa.Sutra sthana Visarga kala (southern sollistice) this continuous pattern of 6 seasons have major role play on maintaining positive health[Ash.Hri.Sutra sthana 3/1-2] [3] Ayurveda gives detail description of the diet,condition of 10 | www.symbiohealth.com metabolic and digestive power, accumulation and augmentation of doshas according to seasonal variations and importance of seasonal Panchakarma to be carried to prevent the occurrence of diseases. Dominant Dosha Panchakarma [Ash.Hri.Sutra Bronchitis Chronic sinusitis This is the practical pattern of preserving health through Ayurveda by using its most effective curative Panchakarma in healthy individuals . Practicing Ayurveda as way of life one can restraint oneself from various health hazards . For this, awareness and mass education are needed. e.Code of good conduct( achar rasayan ):The concept of good and bad company in relation to epigenetic has been nicely elaborated which indirectly contributes to positive health of individual. Concept of achara rasayan (good conduct )[Cha.Sa.Chikitsa Sthan 1(4)/30-35] [1] is the best virtue of thought given by Ayurveda. These rules of social behavior fit in contemporary era where death due to violence, bad virtue of drug ,alcohol addicts, self-harm victims have increased dramatically. It is practicing truth, refrain anger, violence, live in peace and yet disease free. These principles line the base of treating psychosomatic disorders. As mental health surpasses any science of reality when it comes to managing it. So this holistic approach can make easy roadmap for Mental Health . f.If we sum up the different 4 levels of prevention[2] and practical approach of Ayurveda 11 | www.symbiohealth.com Primodial prevention Primary prevention Secondary prevention Tertiary prevention Concept of discouraging children to adopt harmful lifestyle that may lead to diseases like obesity, HTN, smoking, alcoholism, malnutrition, DM, etc. Personal hygiene Nutritional code of conduct Early wakeup Sleep protocols Exercise code of good conduct (Promotive) Action taken prior to the onset of disease,which removes the possibility that the disease will occur. Seasonal dietary regimen and exercise Seasonal Panchakarma Maternal and child care (garbhini and sutika parycharya ) Psychological code of conduct (Preventive) Action which halts the progress of disease at its incipient stage and prevents complications\". Identify disease at pre stage(Sthansa nshraya avastha) Like pre diabetic, essential HTN Curative Panchakarma , Curative exercise and diet (Curative) All measure available to reduce or limit impairments and disabilities, minimize suffering caused by existing departures from good health\". Ayurvedic principle management Internal medicine Rehabilitative Panchakarma Rasayanas Immune enhancing (Rehabilitative) , 4.Applied researches on preservation and protection of health: Preservation and protection in concern to health has a diverse conceptualization in totality. a. Preservation of health : What is already at optimum level must be maintained in the same condition as preservation. And more to be specific this goal of preservation is more in hand of an individual by following all healthy ways namely physical code of conduct, nutritional code of 12 | www.symbiohealth.com conduct, behavioral code of conduct and spiritual code of conduct as discussed earlier. In Ayurvedic terminology maintaining optimum quantity and quality of body tissues can be termed as \" preservation\" . Rasayana (immune-modulatory drugs) helps to maintain the bodily tissues in optimum quality with a disease-free body. b. Protection of health[2]: It is defined as \"The provision of condition for normal mental and physical functioning of individual or community. This includes Promotion of health, prevention from sickness, curative and restorative aspects Care of Environment (air, water, soil pollution), occupational hazards \" Health Protection\" is more of related to bunch of avoidable(personal care) and unavoidable factors like flood, hurricane, pandemic, earthquake, war etc. It is more of a team effort of the health care system, government and individual c. Applied Researches: 1Migration of aluminum from food contact materials to food-a health risk for consumers.by Thorsten Stalh 1.

Chikitsa sthana 11/12-13][3] 8.Immunomodulatory effects of agents of plant origin by Lilly Ganju 8.Rasayan are discussed to enhance immunity and defend illness. d. Suggested researches: Reverse pharmacology is paving waves. Innumerable herbal extract, their active ingredients are put on animal trials for their efficacy and safety profiles. The antibiotic resistance has been a new human disaster which curbs the progress of health care system. MDR(Multi drug resistant) ,XDR(extensive drug resistant) cases in increasing numbers are actually fleeting the progress of healthy population. Few amongst the various herbs which are studied are Ashwagandha , Ayurvedic drugs are proven and are still on research platforms by various pharma companies. What more to go is the actual trials on human population, to prove their efficacy in combination drugs. Many more such Ayurvedic formulations from varied textual references are still untouched ,unveiled, unthought. This is the need of hour to study the safety profile of various mineralo- herbal drugs . As the speed of action needed to be fast and none other than our mineralo-herbal drugs can serve the need. There are many treasured combination drugs which can really go to authentic research testimony .Mental health is also of great concern so the researchers must see this as new area to develop skills ,as we lack expertise in Ayurvedic psychiatry . 14 | www.symbiohealth.com 5.Prevention of disease Occurrence and Recurrence: a. Occurrence : Occurrence is related to questions like why, when and how the disease had occurred. b. Recurrence: On other hand recurrence is repetition after remission of same set of symptoms on same or other place. Theoretical frame work Occurrence and recurrence depend on factors like place of birth, tissues involved in pathology, mental and physical power of patient, time and duration of diseases, physical traits of subject, digestion and metabolic strength, age, mental deposition of subject, adaptation and food habits [Cha. Sa. Sharira sthana 6/13][1]. So, a kaphaja dominant trait individual will have more tolerance to occurrence/recurrence of diseases as compared to that of Pittaja and Vataja dominant traits. Old age group subjects are prone to diseases related to bones, memory whereas the children frequently suffer from cough and cold. Gastro intestinal disease dominate the middle age population particularly in month of October -November ( pitta vitiation season ) Occurrence When we talk health in Ayurvedic perspective we basically deal with the main stay of balancing the deranged components ( Dhatusamya) [Ash.Hri.Sutrasthan1/19][3] Wholesome cause to this condition could be wrapped in terms called as the wrong sensorial working ,with deranged disturbed set of wisdom and the wrong time of the factors responsible for occurrence of diseases .[Cha. Sa. Sharira sthana 1/98][1] For instance, a person with history of diabetes in family genetics if is in habit of consuming high calories food with wrong pattern of lifestyle at the age of 40 would have high chances of getting Diabetes. And this deranged sense of not controlling once greed for food will lead to sensorial derangement like eyes not able to see due to diabetic retinopathy,skin lose its sense of best touch due to neurological deficit etc.. 15 | www.symbiohealth.com One more cause of occurrence is said to be vitiation of all doshas and accumulation of these deranged doshas at places wherever there is open space. Channels carrying varied nutritive elements in body are actually the space where if any obstruction takes place will lead to disruption of normal functions. Recurrence It has been vividly explained in Ayurveda treatise in accordance to the pathogenesis of vishama jwara which could be compared with fevers like Malaria, Typhoid, Dengue in modern perspective. The vitiated doshas get deep seated at tissue level and seeks their hype in a favorable environment. Similarly, the recurrence of Plasmodium Vivax is more due to the hypnozoites taking shelter in liver and causes recurrence in symptoms of Malaria when host immune system is hampered. Cancer recurrence on same or other sites, reactivation of Tuberculosis from primary focus in Latent state etc. can be explained on similar terms. A little sprinkle of water cannot slow down the huge fire bash. Or excess amount of water in rivers can destroy the farms.Similarly improper management of deranged doshas ,dhatu, mala and agni can lead to recurrence of diseases. [Cha.Sa.Chikitsa sthana 30/314][1] Prevention of Occurrence and Recurrence : If we practically work on prevention, the principle of management goes straight. One to avoid the cause: Etiology responsible for the advent of any disease if identified and restricted can avoid the occurrence. Tobacco in cancer, diet high in calories in obesity, salt in HTN, stale food in indigestion etc Panchakarma , diet (seasonal), exercise, daily regimen, sound sleep, good food habits, good code of conduct can also help in avoiding occurrence. 16 | www.symbiohealth.com Identification of diseases in prodromal stage (stage of accumulation of doshas ) and treatment at this stage will curb the disease progress and even avoid the complications.[Su.Sa.Sutrasthan 21/37][4] Once the disease has progressed, treated but not to level of extinction, the chance of recurrence is possible. So for that stage use of seasonal rasayanas , disease centric rasayanas can be used. Vardhamana ( increasing order use of pippali)[ in Bronchial Asthma in season of disease aggravation, Sheelajeeta in diabetes, obesity, khadira in skin ailments, lohasava in patient of anaemia etc. For preventing recurrence purification process by identifying the dominant doshas can be applied. As for a patient with paralysis a minimum 3-4 [Su.Sa.Chikitsa sthana 5/19][4] months treatment with internal medicine and Panchakarma procedures can help in curbing the tail of disease progress thus preventing recurrence. 6.Model of Health Care and its Propagation The quote gains its meaning when it comes to pockets of poor and needy i.e., \"Health is Wealth\". In developing country where receiving basic needs of food, clothing and shelter are at stake, affordable, facilitated, high quality health care system would be of sky reach. So to bring the dreams to right scenario one need to set a model where the technological progress of Modern medicine along with the multidimensional defensive protocols of Ayurvedic principles could be applied. The flaring pandemic of non-communicable and chronic diseases 17 | www.symbiohealth.com have increased the need of implementing an affordable, feasible healthcare model. Arogyavardhini clinics employ Ayurveda graduates need a firm support system of overall health care and government. If we are able to work on the basics of primary health care by proper planning, promotion, execution, there shall be lesser burden on secondary and tertiary care. Prevention as the key model in programming health system shall set a milestone. Modern science has been an aggressive participant, while dealing with emergencies, but this is half reached if not taken care of complete healing. Curative, Rehabilitative, Restorative Ayurveda hereby play an important role in process of complete healing. Instances like neurological disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, rheumatological disorders, cardiac ailments, etc. are areas to prove the genre of excellence. 18 | www.symbiohealth.com Palliative care for respiratory ailments, skin disorders and many non-communicable disorders like DM, dyslipidemia, obesity, spine disorders, gastrointestinal ailments, etc. shall be in affordable and feasible range if handled jointly.. Maternal and child health programs on similar lines of Ayurvedic protocols ( garbhini and sutika parycharya ) will help in better mother and progeny care. Mental illness with proper counseling protocols of holistic approach of Ayurveda can be a new frontier look. Cancer, an agony to mankind, can be thought to heal from medicinal, yogic and panchakarma approaches. Antibiotic resistance a newer threat can be lessened by use of Ayurvedic herbal antibiotic with evidence-based researches. To reach the heights of sky in the best healthcare system, one has to work on ground levels. 7.Future Strategies for Preservation of Health \"A vision without strategy remains an illusion\" Victory is much more meaningful when it comes not just from one person but joint achievements of many . Here the joint efforts of an individual, state and central government are also needed. Indulging in promotion of Ayurveda through government programs will boost the belief of general public. Researches are on their way but implementation is far more needed by propagating and making policies in favor of Ayurvedic treatment modalities. Acceptance for global wellbeing is prime need. The conventional public health measures or interventions have been a failure in making inroads into lifestyle reforms. Ayurvedic promotional concepts deals with the fact that it gives meaning to life, it makes understand the need of reforming the way of living right from the concept of waking us early in morning to sleeping calmly at night precisely emphasizes biological health . A multi-dimensional strategy of involvement varied traits of health care system for achieving health on personal, social, environmental, mental and spiritual domain. \" One Nation, One Health System\" under one roof for better future. 19 | www.symbiohealth.com Strategies plot: Biological health by prevention and maintaining the homeostasis of various components of health must be inculcated amongst the masses by proper channeling and intervention of Government Schemes. This could be achieved by promoting right way of living, eating, exercising, yogic strength, promoting daily regimen, seasonal regimen, mental health preservation etc. The adulteration in food and food eating pattern must be corrected and right conduct of food manners must be advocated. Trained expertise in any field makes the project more realistic and practical. Vision of better tomorrow by preserving today, avoiding the occurrence and managing the recurrence of diseases must be the foreseen planning of Health Care System. Standardization of drugs, proper evidence-based researches, clinical trials, will promote the relevance and believes among general public. Standard protocols of Panchakarma in healthy and diseased must be formed. All the health care model fulfilling all corners of approach must be focused and implemented so there is low cost effective primary, secondary and tertiary care. 20 | www.symbiohealth.com \"Villages to Metro\", every nook and corner , Ayurveda needs a strong government compelled public support. Including Ayurveda in National Programs in coordination with Allopathic management will lessen the burden of diseases. Conceptualizing herd immunity for better protection of communities from pandemic should be thought. Take away message: Vision of today give the beauty of tomorrow . As we sow so shall we reap. Let's sow the biological health at core of the soil for a disease-free future. Let's preserve, protect, conserve, maintain and serve good, complete, positive Health to the World. Let's live Ayurveda!
