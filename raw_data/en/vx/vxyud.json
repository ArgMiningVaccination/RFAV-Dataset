Preface ser charges are playing an increasingly important role in financing federal programs. In response to a request from the Senate Committee on the Bud- get, this study documents the growth of user charges since 1980 and analyzes the economic and legal issues they have raised over the years as well as the more recent effects of changes in law and budget processes. It also assesses the potential for the growth of user charges. The principal author of the study was Pearl W. Richardson of the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO's) Tax Analysis Division, under the direction of Rosemary D. Marcuss, Eric J. Toder, and Joseph J. Cordes.

In 1991, user charges--such as pass- port fees, national park entrance fees, and gasoline excise taxes--amounted to nearly $120 billion and were the sole source of fi- nancing for some programs. User charges are not new. Since the founding of the republic, federal lawmakers have sought to make some programs partly or entirely self-supporting. But a large and persistent federal deficit has created new incentives to expand the scope of user charges and to substitute them for broad- based taxes as a source of program funds. This trend has been particularly marked since the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1985. Choosing Between User Charges and Broad-Based Taxes Apart from their role in the budget, user charges differ from broad-based taxes in their nature and function. User charges are fees or taxes that are based on benefits individuals or firms receive from the federal government or that in some way compensate for costs they might impose on society or its resources. By contrast, income and many other taxes bear little direct relationship to people's use of or benefits from public services or resources. User charges are feasible for a variety of goods and services that the government may provide or that it can control by denying access to nonpayers or by prohibiting nonpayers from engaging in certain activities. Most of the goods that the government pro- vides are public and therefore more suitable for general-fund financing. For example, it would be impractical to impose user charges for such services as national defense because they benefit many people collectively and be- cause excluding nonpayers from access to their benefits would be difficult, if not impos- sible. Imposing user charges that are based strictly on costs and benefits would also be un- warranted when the goal of a program is to make certain goods and services more acces- sible to lower-income individuals, or to pro- vide equal access to all, regardless of their ability to pay. From an economic standpoint, user charges serve two purposes: they allocate resources and distribute costs in proportion to the bene- fits received. The degree of difference between user charges and broad-based taxes depends on how direct the relationship is between the charge and the benefit. When the correlation is close, user charges function as prices. Thus, they serve as a mechanism for allocating re- sources, although, if the proceeds of user charges are subject to Congressional appropri- ation, the political system also plays a role. When general tax funds provide the financing for goods and services, the political process alone determines how much to supply. x THE GROWTH OF FEDERAL USER CHARGES August 1993 The Growth of User Charges User charges are increasingly relied upon as a source of federal funds. Between 1980 and 1991, user charges increased by 54 percent in constant dollars (1991 = 100). User charges include four distinct types of levies: user fees, regulatory fees, benefit-based taxes, and liability-based taxes. Between 1980 and 1991 (measured in constant dollars): o User fees--payments made by individuals or businesses for goods or services provided by the government, consumed voluntarily, and not generally shared by other mem- bers of society--increased by 46 percent to more than $90 billion. o Regulatory fees--charges that stem from the government's powers to regulate the economy and the activities of individuals-- more than tripled to $4 billion. o Benefit-based taxes--taxes dedicated to trust funds and levied on bases correlated in varying degrees with use of a publicly provided good or service--increased by 61 percent to nearly $23 billion. o Liability-based taxes--excises dedicated to trust funds and levied for the purpose of abating hazards or compensating for injuries--starting from a small base, in- creased nearly sixfold to $2.5 billion. Interagency Differences in Reliance on User Charges Although the general increase in user charges has been substantial, it has not been uniform. Some laws limit or prohibit charges; others authorize charges that assure the complete recovery of costs. Thus, user charges today finance a larger share of the budgets of some, but by no means all, programs. In view of the diversity of the goods and services that the federal government provides, practices in set- ting user charges naturally vary widely. But even programs that are similar in nature may not assess charges for goods or services in the same way or with the same effect and thus may or may not recover program costs or encourage optimal use of scarce resources. De- pending on the circumstances, such differ- ences may reflect deliberate policy or long- standing practice. The natures of the agencies that are most likely to be financed from user charges vary. Some are primarily involved in producing and selling products, such as power. Others--the Postal Service, for example--sell services. These programs have traditionally received most of their funding from their customers. Beginning within the past decade, several regulatory agencies have derived most or all of their operating funds from user charges. In most cases, as a result of a change in law or ad- ministrative action, agencies have assessed fees for programs that previously had been fi- nanced from general funds. But some agen- cies--for example, the Environmental Protec- tion Agency and the Food and Drug Adminis- tration--have levied new fees and specifically earmarked the funds for hiring new staff and expediting regulatory processes. Despite the recent growth in regulatory charges, practices may vary from agency to agency. For activities that are similar in na- ture, federal agencies may in some cases be collecting fees that fully recoup and even ex- ceed program costs, as in the case of the Secu- rities and Exchange Commission; in other cases, such as the Commodity Futures Trad- ing Commission, the government may be as- sessing virtually no charges. These differ- ences have evolved over time and suggest that user charges for some services may increase. Again, notwithstanding recent trends, the federal government's practices in charging for SUMMARY the rights to use public lands and to extract natural resources vary widely. For example, the federal government charges market prices (through a lease-bidding process) for oil and gas leases on public lands (including the sub- merged lands of the Outer continental Shelo. But charges for grazing on public lands, water resources, and hardrock mining claims are far below their market value and thus provide a subsidy that may encourage poor use of scarce resources. Fees for the use of federal recrea- tional facilities administered by the Depart- ments of Agriculture and Interior and the Army Corps of Engineers also are far below program and maintenance costs. All of these charges are for goods and services that benefit private parties but that all taxpayers are now subsidizing either partially or entirely. In these cases, too, the potential exists for in- creases in user charges. Effects of Changes in Law and Budget Processes on User Charges Most of the new and increased charges of the 1980s followed the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1985. As the search for new sources of funds intensified, changes in law and budget processes helped assure the enact- ment of new user charges. Beginning with the Consolidated Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, the legal basis for setting certain user charges expanded from reimbursing an agency's costs of providing services to financing all or a specified portion of an agency's budget. Previous statutes had set fees in relation to the costs of providing particular services to private beneficiaries, not to an agency's overall budget. Recent decisions of the Supreme Court and of lower courts have upheld the broad user charge legislation enacted since 1985. Several Supreme Court cases in the past two decades have focused on the distinctions between fees and taxes and on the conditions for a constitu- tional delegation of authority from the Con- gress to executive agencies. In clarifying the constitutional issues that have been associ- ated with user charges, these decisions pro- vide a legal framework for expanding the scope of user charge financing. Finally, the treatment of user charges in the budget differs from that of taxes levied on broad bases. Unlike most taxes, which flow into general revenues, most user charges are either offset against (that is, subtracted from) outlays or dedicated to trust or special funds for specific purposes. Since 1985, policymakers have increasingly offset charges against outlays and, on occa- sion, devised fees that are much like taxes. This practice has developed for several rea- sons. The budget reports net outlays--the amount that remains after subtracting fees and other collections from gross outlays. Im- posing fees that the budget measures as an off- set against outlays thus allows supporters of a program to expand or maintain government services without increasing reported spending or revenues. Since offsetting collections re- duce net outlays, a Congressional authorizing committee can meet its budget reconciliation targets by raising fees instead of cutting pro- grams. For the same reason, the appropri- ations committees can impose or raise fees in order to comply with the discretionary spend- ing limits in the Budget Enforcement Act. The Outlook for User Charges The Congress has adopted a budget resolution that sets substantial deficit reduction targets over the next five years. Increases in and ex- tensions of user charges will help meet these targets. Since 1985, budget reconciliation measures have included new and increased xii THE GROWTH OF FEDERAL USER CHARGES August 1993 user charges.

Chapter One Introduction: Fees, Taxes, and User Charges T estifying at Congressional hearings in March 1987, then-Secretary of Com- merce Malcolm Baldrige was asked how he distinguished between a fee and a tax. \"I think it is simple,\" he replied. \"If it is a Democratic proposal, it is a tax; if it is Repub- lican, it is a user fee.\"l The jest notwithstand- ing, the question has confounded more than one legislator and been the subject of several legal decisions. The facts are that the mean- ings of the terms \"user fee\" and \"user charge\" are ambiguous, and the distinction between fees and taxes at times is unclear. This study takes a broad view of user charges. In practice, the terms \"user fee\" and \"user charge\" have been applied to several means of raising funds for government pro- grams by assessing their beneficiaries. For some policymakers and analysts, the terms re- fer only to fees, but for others they describe not only fees but taxes dedicated to trust funds that provide financing for specific purposes, such as gasoline excise taxes, which mostly support federal highway expenditures. Federal agencies have defined user fees broadly, as prices \"charged identifiable indi- viduals or entities by the federal government for a service or good\" that \"the government controls,\" and narrowly, as prices imposed to recover the cost to the federal government of providing \"special benefits to an identifiable recipient beyond those that accrue to the gen- eral public.\"2 The narrower definition rests on a distinction between special benefits to indi- viduals and businesses and general benefits to the public--a distinction that is often clearer in theory than in practice. The leasing of government-owned land to private firms, for example, clearly confers a special benefit; pro- viding for the national defense is obviously a general benefit. But between these extremes lie a wide variety of services that may provide special benefits to particular individuals or businesses and general benefits to the public. User charges represent an attempt to match those who pay for federal services with those who receive them. In the broadest sense, user charges also include assessments to lessen a burden that individuals or businesses impose (or might impose) on third parties. Liability- based charges are the mirror image of beneficiary-based charges and are an attempt to match those who pay for corrective actions with those who might cause the conditions re- quiring them. Like beneficiary-based charges, liability-based charges may take the form of fees or dedicated excise taxes. This study covers beneficiary- and liability- based fees and taxes levied for private goods and for goods or services that may provide a mix of public and private benefits. It does not include fees or other collections that are asso- 1. House Committee on Appropriationa.

In general, payroll tax- es have a broader base and are less discretion- ary than most user charges, since individuals and firms can avoid them only by avoiding most forms of employment. August 1993 The budget deficits of recent years have drawn attention to user charges as a means of funding federal programs. The approach has, in turn, raised issues of concern to policy- makers and analysts. These issues--which are the focus of this study--include the differences between user charges and taxes levied on broad bases and the purposes for which user charges are most suitable; how user charges should be set; whether user charges are grow- ing and, if so, for what types of programs; the legal distinctions between fees and taxes; the ways in which changes in law and budget pro- cesses have affected user charges; and the potential for the growth of user charges in the future. Chapter Two Definitions and Issues ser and user-related charges are fees or taxes that are based on benefits or liabilities. User charges are feasible for private goods and for a variety of quasi-' public goods and services that the govern- ment can control by denying access to non- payers or by prohibiting nonpayers from engaging in certain activities. Unlike user charges, most taxes are unre- lated to particular benefits or liabilities. It would be impracticable to impose user charges for purely public goods, such as national de- fense, because many people collectively con- sume the same amount of them and because excluding nonpayers from access to benefits would be difficult, if not impossible. But where the government controls a commodity, such as hydroelectric power, or a facility, such as Yellowstone National Park, it can charge users and deny access to nonpayers just as a private firm would. The government can also set conditions for doing business that include adherence to regulations and payment of asso- ciated costs. Thus, in regulating the nuclear energy industry, the government charges firms for reviewing construction permits, granting operating licenses, and conducting inspections of nuclear reactors--in other words, for services required for compliance with the law. Finally, the government levies taxes that are earmarked for trust funds or special funds and that are generally, if not perfectly, correlated with benefits to the payer or costs to society. The economic and budgetary effects of user charges differ from those of taxes levied on broad bases. From an economic standpoint, the function of user charges is to allocate re- sources and distribute costs in line with bene- fits that the government provides or the costs that some activities may impose on society. By contrast, income and many other taxes bear little direct relationship to people's use of or benefits from public services. Within the budget, user charges usually fund specific programs or agencies. Most tax- es, apart from social insurance, flow into gen- eral revenues. Some user charges do also, but, more commonly, user charges are deducted from program or agency outlays or are dedi- cated to trust or special funds for specific pur- poses. From an operational standpoint, the distinction between a special fund and a trust fund is insignificant. In general, trust fund re- ceipts are invested in Treasury debt securities and collect interest. Special fund balances are normally not so invested and do not earn in- terest. The funds provide a means for account- ing for receipts and expenditures of ear- marked revenues and do not have the fidu- ciary characteristics of true trusts. The Varieties of User Charges There are four distinct types of user charges: user fees, regulatory fees, benefit-based taxes, and liability-based taxes. Of these, user fees are the most significant in terms of current dollar volume, followed by benefit-based tax- es, regulatory fees, and liability-based taxes in that order (see Figure 1). 4 THE GROWTH OF FEDERAL USER CHARGES August 1993 User Fees User fees are payments made by individuals or businesses for goods or services provided by the government, consumed voluntarily, and not generally shared by other members of soci- ety. User fees are levied for goods and services that are beneficiary based. Apart from being charged by the government, user fees are simi- lar in kind, although not necessarily in amount, to payments made in ordinary busi- ness transactions in the private sector and of- ten may be for the kinds of goods and services that the private sector also provides. User fees include royalties on natural re- sources; canal, bridge, and highway tolls; in- surance premiums; lease and rental pay- ments; and charges for recurring sales of re- sources (such as water, minerals, and timber) and products (such as power), the use of fed- eral land (such as for grazing livestock), the use of federal facilities and access to national parks, services (such as mail delivery, disposal of nuclear fuel, and enrichment of uranium), and permits and licenses not associated with regulatory programs. Regulatory Fees Regulatory fees are charges based on the gov- ernment's power to regulate particular busi- nesses or activities. These charges include fees for regulatory and judicial services; im- migration, passport, and consular fees; Cus- toms Service fees; fees for testing, inspec- tion, and grading services; patent, trademark, and copyright fees; and registration, filing, permit, and license fees associated with regu- latory programs. In general, these charges-- which may be beneficiary- or liability-based, or both--are for functions that are tradition- ally performed by government and only rarely by the private sector. Regulatory fees stem from the powers that the government exercises as a sovereign state, such as the powers to levy taxes and duties and to regulate commerce. Regulatory fees in- Figure 1.

CHAPTER TWO DEFINITIONS AND ISSUES 5 clude charges for licenses, which the govern- ment may require as a condition for permit- ting a commercial activity. Regulatory fees also include charges for such services as in- spections, which may benefit the fee payer, lessen the fee payer's imposition of costs or risks on others or on society as a whole, or both. Frequently, such charges are for activi- ties undertaken in order to make sure that a firm has followed prescribed measures to avert environmental or other damage to public health and safety. The government often sets safety standards for certain types of industrial activity and charges firms for the cost of inspecting their plants to assure compliance. From the stand- point of the regulated party, such services seem to benefit the payer little and thus the charges seem to be more like taxes than fees for service. From the standpoint of the federal government, however, such charges compen- sate for costs that a business imposes or might impose on society when it pollutes or other- wise damages a public resource. By compari- son, when the government issues a passport or grants a patent, the benefit to an identifiable private recipient is clear. Although all regula- tory fees stem from the sovereign power of government, the issue of who benefits from certain types of regulatory activity has been at times controversial (see Chapter 3). Beneficiary-Based Taxes Taxes on benefits, or beneficiary-based taxes, are charges levied on bases correlated in vary- ing degrees with the use of a publicly provided good or service. Benefit taxes may be proxies for user fees and are usually dedicated to trust or special funds. Most benefit taxes are related to transporta- tion and nature conservation. More fre- quently than not, they are excises. For pur- poses of this study, excise and other taxes are user charges when the law creates a relation- ship between the collection of a tax on a prod- uct and the provision of a good or service. Generally, the relationship involves dedicat- ing the tax to a trust or special fund for a pur- pose that directly or indirectly benefits the payer. For example: o Taxes on gasoline, diesel fuel, gasohol, tires and inner tubes, truck and trailer sales, and annual taxes on highway vehi- cles (trucks) weighing more than 55,000 pounds are dedicated to the Highway Trust Fund, which finances the mainten- ance and the improvement of roads and bridges and supports highway safety and traffic control projects within the federal highway system.1 The taxes on trucks and trailers, highway vehicles, and tires for heavy vehicles are intended to approxi- mate charges for highway wear and tear. (A more exact relationship between charges and use of the highways would also take distance into account.) A mass transit account receives 1.5 cents per gal- lon of the gasoline tax. Fuels for farm use or for construction equipment are exempt from the tax. The National Recreational Trails Trust Fund, established in 1991, was authorized to receive, subject to appro- priation, amounts equal to 0.3 percent of total Highway Trust Fund receipts for the year following its enactment and there- after revenues corresponding to nonhigh- way recreational fuel taxes, up to a maxi- mum of $30 million a year. To date, the Congress has not appropriated any funds to the account. o Taxes on air passenger tickets, air cargo, noncommercial jet fuel and aviation gaso- line, and a head tax on international departures are dedicated to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which finances airport construction and improvements, development of the airway system, and a portion of Federal Aviation Administra- tion operations. 1. Revenues from the current 2.5 cents per gallon excise tax on highway motor fuels and on rail fuels are not user changes, since the taxes finance the government's gen- eral operations. Under the Omnibus Budget Reconcili- ation Act of 1990, they are retained in the general fund through September 30,1995. August 1993 6 THE GROWTH OF FEDERAL USER CHARGES o Taxes on fuels used by vessels plying speci- fied inland and intracoastal waterways are dedicated to the Inland Waterways Trust Fund and used for construction and reha- bilitation of navigational facilities within these waterways. o Taxes on the value of cargo loaded or un- loaded at U.S. harbors, channels, and ports are dedicated to the operation and main- tenance necessary for commercial naviga- tion of U.S. ports and harbors. o Taxes on motorboat fuels, electric out- board motors, sportfishing equipment, and sonar devices for finding fish are dedicated to the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund, which promotes boating safety and fish restoration. This fund has two accounts: one for boating safety, the other for sport- fish restoration. Motorboat fuel taxes are transferred from the Highway Trust Fund to these accounts. Of the 14 cents per gal- lon tax on motorboat and small engine fuels, 11.5 cents goes into the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund, and the remainder goes into the general fund. The Land and Water Conservation Fund, administered by the Department of the Interior, receives $1 million a year of the revenues from motorboat fuels. Beneficiary-based taxes differ from fees, not only in the structure of the charge, but also in the degree of connection between the payers of the charge and the benefits or services that are financed with the proceeds. Taxes are more likely than fees to be levied at uniform rates with less regard for differences in cost for facilities within a system or for differences in the use of the system. For example, nearly all purchasers of gasoline pay the motor fuels ex- cise tax, even though individuals vary widely in their use of interstate highways. The charge is thus more loosely related to the benefit it provides than is, say, a highway toll. But it is more closely related to a benefit than, for example, the income tax. Benefit taxes frequently involve some amount of cross-subsidy. A cross-subsidy oc- curs when one group pays fees that reflect more than its share of costs, while another group pays fees that reflect less than its share. In these cases, the higher-paying group is sub- sidizing the lower-paying group. Although typically less with fees, cross-subsidies may occur with either fees or benefit taxes. Thus, in this regard, taxes and fees are different in degree, not in kind. Liability-Based Taxes Another group of trust fund excise taxes are dedicated to paying down liabilities. Liabil- ity-based taxes are excises levied for the pur- pose of abating hazards or compensating for injuries. Where possible, the government col- lects damages from responsible parties. But at times, taxes on products that might have some connection with the cause of damages serve as proxies for recovering damages from responsible parties. Thus: o Taxes on crude petroleum and feedstock (and equivalent import duties on crude pe- troleum and certain chemical derivatives) are dedicated to the Hazardous Substance Trust Fund (Superfund), which provides fi- nancing for coping with environmental damage caused by hazardous substances, including cleanup of contaminated sites. Superfund also receives revenues from an environmental tax on corporations equal to 0.12 percent of the modified alternative minimum taxable income of the corpora- tion in excess of $2 million. In 1991, for the first time, the corporate tax was the largest single source of tax revenues for Superfund. In this study, user charges in- clude these revenues. o Additional taxes on gasoline, diesel and other motor fuels, methanol and ethanol fuels, aviation fuels, and fuels used by ves- sels in inland waterways are dedicated to CHAPTER TWO the Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Trust Fund, which covers cleanup costs when the party responsible is insol- vent or fails to deal with the problem. o Taxes on crude oil are dedicated to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, which pays to clean up oil spills and covers claims for damages resulting from them. The tax is effective through December 30, 1994; how- ever, if the unobligated balance of the oil spill fund is more than $1 billion at the end of any quarter, the tax rate will be zero for the following quarter. For the quarter be- ginning July 1,1993, the tax rate was zero. If the balance in the fund is subsequently less than $1 billion at the end of a quarter, the tax rate will be 5 cents per barrel at the start of the quarter that begins 90 days after the close of the quarter for which the calculation was made. o Taxes on domestically mined coal finance the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, which was set up to compensate miners disabled by pneumoconiosis (black lung disease) or to recompense their survivors. o Taxes on vaccines are dedicated to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund, which provides funds to compensate people for injuries resulting from prescribed diph- theria, pertussis, tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella, and polio vaccines istered after October 1, 1988. T'ne tax ex- pired on January 1, 1993; the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ex- tended it permanently. DEFINITIONS AND ISSUES 7 them. In this respect, they are analogous to certain liability-based regulatory fees, just as benefit-based taxes are analogous to user fees. Taxes levied on the source of an environ- mental danger may reduce the activity that causes the danger. Taxes levied on the sources of health or environmental hazards also may substitute for insurance programs. How much they do depends on the strength of the rela- tionships between the taxes and the potential liabilities that they finance. The more direct the relationship, the more effective the tax will be in compensating for actual damage. The strength of the relationships between current excise taxes and the liabilities they finance varies. For example, the excise taxes dedicated to Superfund are imposed on some, but not all, hazardous chemicals, and not on the waste produced in either manufacturing or using them. Thus, the user of the chemicals, having paid the tax, has no direct incentive to prevent or reduce pollution. The Superfund, leaking underground storage tank, and oil spill taxes finance control and cleanup once damage has occurred, but do nothing directly to reduce or prevent it. These taxes also fall short of functioning as insurance charges be- cause they finance cleanup of damages that occurred before the taxes were enacted. The taxes levied for the Vaccine Injury Compensa- tion Trust Fund, in contrast, cover prospective damages and, thus, more closely approximate insurance payments. The use of excise taxes to finance liabilities illustrates the trend toward using dedicated taxes to pay for environmental and other dam- age imposed on third parties. Liability-based taxes are likely to be reflected in consumer prices and may be said to represent an attempt--however imprecise--to include with- in the final prices of certain goods the costs im- posed on society of producing or consuming - Policy Issues in Setting User Charges User charges ideally are prices and are there- fore rationing mechanisms for allocating the goods and services that the government pro- vides. Some user charges, however, are much more like prices than others: some are closely 8 THE GROWTH OF FEDERAL USER CHARGES August 1993 related to the costs of providing benefits; oth- ers are hardly related at all. User charges are also a means of assuring fairness by equitably distributing the burden of paying for govern- ment services among those who benefit from them.2 The standards for evaluating user charges are based on their effectiveness as an allocative mechanism and an instrument for promoting fairness, and on the reasonableness of their administrative and compliance costs. Of the array of goods and services that the federal government provides, some may be available through the private market. Some may have high one-time costs, so that only the government or a natural monopoly can pro- vide them; or they are scarce resources, such as public lands; or are regulatory in natire. Some may benefit private parties only; others may have external benefits. The suitability of a charge will depend on both the nature of the product and the aims of public policy. The Standards for Evaluating User Charges: Efficiency How efficiently, or how well, the economic sys- tem allocates resources depends on how pro- ducers and suppliers of services set prices. A necessary condition for achieving efficiency of allocation is that prices of goods and services be equal to the marginal or incremental costs of producing them. People are likely to pur- chase a good until the value they place on the last unit they consume equals the price. If the price is set below marginal cost, consum- 2.

If the price of a good is greater than its marginal cost, consumers will de- mand less of it. When competitive markets are working well, prices naturally tend toward marginal costs and lead to efficient allocation of resources. User charges can promote economic effi- ciency by providing the government with information on the amount of a good or service that it should supply. If they are appropri- ately set, user charges allocate goods and ser- vices to those who value the good the most, encourage use of more suitable or cheaper sub- stitutes, and provide funds to replace subsi- dies. When the government offers no subsi- dies and provides goods and services that the private market might supply, a choice may exist between imposing user charges and transferring ownership and operation of a facility from the public to the private sector. User charges, if set at a price that just covers the cost of producing an additional unit, can provide information on the demand for a prod- uct and the revenue it will generate. This information, in turn, can help private firms determine whether to consider taking over a government function or to offer competing products. Goods That Have High Fixed Costs. If the government sells goods that a competitive market might also supply, setting prices equal to marginal costs should result in an efficient allocation of resources. But often, the govern- ment provides goods or services that private firms do not supply efficiently. A competitive market generally functions poorly when larg- er firms can produce goods or services at lower costs than smaller firms. Under those cir- cumstances, a single firm--a so-called natural monopoly--could dominate an entire market. Compared with the competitive ideal, the mo- nopoly tends to produce too little at too high a price. Producers of goods or services who have high fixed costs generally experience decreas- CHAPTER TWO DEFINITIONS AND ISSUES 9 ing average costs of production and could suf- fer losses if they set prices equal to marginal costs. The problem arises because the cost of large fixed investments in plant and equip- ment varies little with the amount of output or use. Thus, the cost of producing an additional unit is small and will not cover fixed invest- ment. Put another way, efficiency of use may conflict with efficiency of investment levels. Efficient use of a good or service requires marginal-cost pricing. But if prices are set be- low average costs, the project or program will not pay for itself, and in the case of goods that the federal government supplies, the shortfall would be financed by taxes that create other efficiency costs. Alternatively, if average costs are higher than marginal costs, potential consumers of the goods or services will be ex- cluded, even if they are willing to pay enough to compensate suppliers for the extra costs. The question then becomes whether to cover the deficit between marginal- and average- cost pricing and, if so, how. The alternatives for the government are (1) permit private firms to recoup their costs but regulate their prices; (2) provide subsidies to private firms; (3) create a publicly owned enterprise and pro- vide subsidies, as necessary; and (4) create a publicly owned enterprise and set prices that recover costs. Electric power production, mass transport, and local communication services are ,typical of enterprises that are likely to be either heavily regulated or publicly owned. Among government-financed goods, invest- ments in infrastructure, such as waterways, usually have high fixed and low marginal costs. The problem then becomes how to re- cover fixed costs without completely sacrific- ing efficient use.3 Two-part tariffs are one approach. These tariffs, which utilities often use, supplement charges for each unit of service with a flat charge that must be paid for any use of the ser- 3. For a detailed analysis of the issues involved in recover- ing the costs of investments in transportation infrastruc- ture, see Congressional Budget Ofice. Paying for High- ways, Airways, and Waterways: How Can Users Be Charged? (May 1992). vice. In recent years, some federal regulatory agencies have used a combination of unit and flat charges to recover costs (see Chapter 5). Other methods of recouping fixed costs in- clude charging prices that exceed marginal costs, but only for consumers with inelastic de- mands, so that effects on use are minimal, or allowing a discount on extra use to consumers who pay a fixed charge. Pricing mechanisms include price discrimination, block rates, and differential pricing. Price discrimination involves differentiat- ing among users, based on the alternatives they have for a good or service. The users who can least easily substitute another good or ser- vice pay the highest price. \"Ramsey pricing\" (named after the economist who advanced the theory) is a technique that uses price discrimi- nation. It involves charging users on the basis of their elasticities of demand (the percentage change in the quantity demanded in response to a percentage change in price). Users who have a low elasticity of demand (perhaps be- cause they cannot easily substitute other goods) pay a higher price. Users who have the most alternatives pay the lowest prices. Thus, a utility might charge lower rates for commer- cial than for residential users. Price discrimi- nation makes it possible to meet a revenue target without departing much from the pat- terns of use that would prevail under mar- ginal-cost pricing. Block rates involve charging a higher rate on the first few units, a lower rate on the next block, and so on. The higher rate helps cover fixed costs, while the lower rate on the last block is likely to reflect marginal costs. This permits people who have made a contribution to fixed costs to consume extra units at lower marginal costs. Differential pricing may take several forms. A common practice when demand for a service varies widely over a 24-hour period, as it does for power or telephone service, involves charg- ing higher prices at peak periods of use. This practice is a form of marginal-cost pricing since, at peak times, excess capacity declines, 10 THE GROWTH OF FEDERAL USER CHARGES and the enterprise looks less and less like a decreasing-cost industry. Resources That Have Scarcity Value. The federal government owns vast tracts of land and controls access to a wide variety of natural resources. These resources have scarcity val- ue. In setting fees, rents for rights to use pub- lic lands, or royalties for the rights to extract natural resources, the concern is not to recover production costs, but to cover management and maintenance costs or to assess a charge that reflects the market value of the resource and thus encourages its optimal use. Estab- lishing an efficient price might involve hold- ing auctions, soliciting bids, or, if private mar- kets offer similar goods, setting prices at com- parable levels.4 Equity In many cases, requiring that the people who benefit from a particular good or service pay for it is both efficient and fair, But rationing, whether by setting prices for goods and ser- vices or otherwise, is always potentially exclu- sionary. The question is, who is excluded and from what? In setting charges, it is useful to distinguish between goods and services that the price sys- tem allocates and goods and services that the political system allocates. In general, the price system is best suited to allocating pri- vate goods. The political system is best suited to allocating public goods, but in the case of merit goods, for example, the state may also become involved in allocating private goods. Merit goods are public or private goods that the state allocates because it has decided that people should have access to them. They are frequently aimed at children or lower-income individuals and include such goods as housing for low-income families or the elderly. 4. A previous Congressional Budget Office study. Auction- ing Radio Spectrum Licenses (March 1992). discussee some of these issues in more detail. August 1993 In charging for nonmerit goods that confer only private benefits, the aim is to assess charges in line with benefits, so as to lessen the burden of taxpayers who derive no benefit from the good or service. E consumers of a ser- vice pay no charges or pay charges that are be- low the costs of providing it, the burden of fi- nancing the service shifts to others. Those burdened could be either unsubsidized con- sumers, who pay prices that are above costs, or taxpayers generally. In the case of nonmerit goods, eliminating cross-subsidies can be equi- table and compatible with efficiency. By contrast, in the case of merit goods, the goals of efficiency and equity may conflict. So- ciety's definition of fairness could involve pro- viding access to certain goods and services, such as health care, housing, or food, to people who otherwise could not afford to pay for them. Generally, the government provides such merit goods free of charge or at prices lower than necessary to recoup incremental costs (instead of simply giving lower-income people cash to spend according to their pref- erences). If the goal is to make certain goods and services more accessible to lower-income individuals, or to provide equal access to all, regardless of ability to pay, user charges that are based strictly on costs and benefits would be unsuitable. The alternative would be ei- ther to impose differential fees or to finance the good or service from general tax funds. In either case, individuals paying higher fees or taxes would subsidize individuals paying low- er fees or taxes, with some resulting decline in efficiency. Services That Provide a Mix of Public and Private Benefits User charges frequently pay for activities that have both private and public benefits. In these instances, the efficient and equitable ap- proach would be to charge for the benefits that are private. Regulatory activities are a good example of services that might provide either private or public benefits, or a mix of the two. CHAPTER TWO DEFINITIONS AND ISSUES 11 Some of the federal government's regula- tory fees are levied for services that confer a private benefit, such as patent and trademark registration or weighing and grading of food products. Firms often purchase services from the private market that are similar to the reg- ulatory, inspection, and grading services that the government provides. For example, issu- ers of both corporate and municipal bonds hire special services to provide ratings and infor- mation for consumers. Similarly, in instances where the government imposes regulations but does not provide regulatory services to as- sure compliance, the regulated parties might hire private firms to do so (generally to avoid the penalties or costs of noncompliance). For example, the federal government has imposed a wide variety of regulations on the issuance of tax-exempt bonds. Without an opihion of bond counsel that the issue qualifies for tax exemption, the bonds are unsalable. Issuers thus hire private counsel to assure that bond offerings comply with regulations. Setting Charges to Reflect External Bene- fits and Costs. In some cases, the private market provides goods or services that benefit not only direct consumers, but society at large. Such goods as drugs that prevent or cure con- tagious diseases are said to have external benefits; for example, public health. In other cases, producing or using a good may impose costs on society in the form of depletion of scarce public resources or damage to the envi- ronment. These are known as external costs; for example, pollution. The greater the exter- nal benefits or costs of private market produc- tion or consumption, the greater the rationale for the government to become involved by tak- ing action to increase the availability of goods that provide external benefits and to decrease the availability of goods entailing external costs. Government intervention may take sev- eral forms, including subsidizing some activi- ties and regulating others. Setting Charges to Reflect External Bene- fits. In some cases, federal agencies assess fees for services that may have external bene- fits; for example, fees for drug certification and approval. In general, consumers of drugs benefit from knowing that the medications they take meet certain standards of safety and effectiveness. If the consumers of drugs were the sole beneficiaries of drug certification, the benefits would be private. But where drugs control or cure highly contagious diseases that have social as well as private costs, the bene- fits are also public. For example, people who have AIDS are highly susceptible to tubercu- losis, which is airborne, contagious, and fre- quently resistant to antibiotics. Thus, the availability of drugs to prevent or cure AIDS would benefit not only those who have the disease or are at risk of contracting it, but would ultimately lessen the risk to the general public of drug-resistant strains of tuberculo- sis. In the interests of both equity and effi- ciency, the charges for drug certification and approval should reflect the mixed nature of the benefits. To a degree such charges do, since they cover only a portion of the federal government's costs. Charging for External Costs. User charges enable the government to impose levies that in some way reflect external costs. The ratio- nale for doing so is that efficient pricing of goods and services should include both the costs to the producing firm and the costs to society. External costs may result from both invest- ment and consumer activities. Air pollution, for example, is produced by industry and auto- mobiles. The amount and cost of damage to the environment is difficult to measure and varies widely among regions. But if these could be determined, one efficient solution would be to impose a tax or a fee that would add the marginal external cost to the mar- ginal private cost, so that the total marginal cost equals the price. This would raise prices and reduce the output of polluting goods and thereby lessen pollution. Similarly, to dis- courage travel in hours of peak activity, charges for using interstate highways could include the external costs of congestion. 12 THE GROWTH OF FEDERAL USER CHARGES August 1993 The right to levy charges for pollution or other external costs stems from the power of the state to regulate the economy and protect the health and safety of its citizens. In exer- cising its powers, the government may set lim- its on property rights. How the government chooses to do so will determine who gets the charges or rents. The government, in effect, may assert that it wholly owns the assimilative capacity of the environment and may charge polluters for us- ing up any portion of it or causing any dam- age. The charges or rents would then go to the government. Or the government, in effect, may hold that within limits consistent with the health and safety of society, the assimila- tive capacity of the environment belongs to private parties. Therefore, it may grant per- mits to pollute up to specified levels (as in the case of the 1990 clean air legislation). Firms might then sell \"pollution rights\" to other firms in much the same way that owners of re- al property might sell \"air rights\" to real es- tate developers. (In many localities, zoning laws establish maximum heights and densi- ties for new construction, and owners of exist- ing buildings with heights and densities below the maximums have the option of selling their \"unused\" air space to developers of adjacent or nearby lots.) Such laws limit the effect of de- velopment on the environment. But assigning the right to pollute or to build up to a certain level to private parties allocates the rents to them, rather than to the government. The federal government levies a number of charges for activities that it undertakes to re- duce external costs. Liability-based taxes and many licensing and inspection fees reflect an attempt to include within the final prices of certain goods the costs imposed on society of producing or consuming them. If regulatory fees and liability-based taxes are reasonable proxies for the external costs of producing or consuming certain goods, they increase effi- ciency. Assessing the cost of potential damage to third parties is a more difficult undertak- ing, and the less direct the link between a fee or a tax and the activity that it finances, the less likely it is that the charge will contribute to economic efficiency (although the charge may represent a reasonable trade-off with other goals, such as administrative ease). At times, firms have objected to paying reg- ulatory fees on the grounds that the charges fi- nance activities that seem to benefit the public as much as, if not more than, the paying firms and are therefore more like taxes. When so challenged, the federal government has fre- quently responded by pointing to the benefits that particular industries and consumers of their products derive from being regulated. From an economic perspective, however, the issue is not whether the industry benefits, but whether regulation is necessary to control ex- ternal costs. If so, then charges for regulatory activities, unlike many taxes, may improve rather than worsen economic efficiency. The structure of a charge--whether it is a fee, a tax, or some other levy--has no economic signifi- cance, although it may have legal conse- quences (see Chapter 3). User Charges Versus Broad-Based Taxes User charges serve two functions: to allocate resources and distribute costs in line with benefits received. They should also raise funds in ways that are relatively easy to ad- minister. User charges affect the allocation and distribution of resources differently than broad-based taxes and are therefore more suit- able under certain circumstances. The degree of difference between user charges and broad- based taxes depends on how close the charge is to a trae fee for a good or service; in other words, to how closely correlated the charge is to the benefit or the liability. When the corre- lation is close, the allocation of resources more accurately reflects the choices of individual consumers and producers; however, if the pro- ceeds of user charges are subject to Congres- sional appropriation, the political system also plays a role. When general tax funds provide the financ- ing for goods and services, the political process CHAPTER TWO DEFINITIONS AND ISSUES 13 alone determines how much to supply. The po- litical process is best suited for determining how public funds should be allocated to public goods, but, except in rare instances when con- sumer preferences are clear to policymakers, financing private goods with general tax funds can lead to poor allocation of resources and in- equities. User charges are more likely to be efficient and equitable when benefits to the payer are direct and less likely to be so when external benefits are significant. When it is important to provide equal access to goods and services for all income groups, regardless of ability to pay, user charges are inappropriate. Fees Versus Benefit (or Liability- Based) Taxes Benefit taxes are similar in some respects to fees and broad-based taxes. Fees usually are levied for a specific service or good and priced accordingly. Thus, highway, bridge, or tunnel tolls might be high at some locations and low- er at others, depending on a variety of factors. Conversely, taxes tend to be uniform through- out a system. Like fees, benefit taxes are re- lated (at times loosely) to a good or service. Like broad-based taxes, benefit taxes are uni- form throughout the country and therefore more likely, in practice, to involve cross- subsidies than fees. For this reason, benefit taxes usually create more losses of economic efficiency than fees. That need not be the case. If set too high or too low, fees can be inefficient and inequitable. And taxes can be efficient if the levy is on a product that is directly related to consumption of a government-supplied good or service. In practice, however, fees are more likely than taxes to be directly related to bene- fits or liabilities. The choice between a fee or a benefit tax is often likely to hinge on ease of administration or collection. Where imposing direct charges is desirable, but too costly, a tax on a com- plementary product may make sense, assum- ing that it is administratively less complex and therefore less costly to collect. Dedicated taxes are often compromises that sacrifice some degree of the efficiency and equity of an ideal user charge to make sure that funds for a specific purpose will be available and not too costly to collect. Highway taxes, for example, generate sufficient revenue for the Interstate Highway System. Their shortcomings are that the charges do not reflect distance, con- gestion costs, pollution costs, or wear and tear by heavy vehicles. Consequently, some users overpay, while others underpay. A system of fees, if properly designed, would avoid the deficiencies of taxes.5 In instances where fees are too difficult or costly to collect, however, the objective, from the standpoint of efficiency and equity, should be to design a tax that is as closely related as possible to the good that the government is providing. At times, it is possible to design and enact a benefit- or liability-based tax that is closely correlated to use and is therefore reasonably efficient, equitable, and easy to collect and ad- minister. The tax on vaccines dedicated to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund is an example. Unlike the Superfund, LUST, oil spill, and Black Lung trust funds, which pro- vide financing to compensate for damage that occurred before the creation of the trust funds, the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund is more like an insurance program in that it compensates for damages that occurred only after the establishment of the trust fund. Damages that occurred before its establish- ment are financed from general funds. More- over, the tax rate per dose varies with each vaccine and is set to approximate potential fu- ture liabilities for damages that may occur from each particular vaccine. Compensation is on a no-fault basis; that is, no attempt is made to assign blame to or to recover damages from individual manufacturers.6 5. Congressional Budget Ofice, Paying for Highways, Air- ways, and Waterways, analyzes current charges for these purposes and suggests alternatives. 6. For a fuller discussion, see Nonna A. Noto and Louis Alan Talley, Excise Tax Financing of Federal Trust Funds (Congressional Research Service, January 5, 1993). pp. 14-15. 14 THE GROWTH OF FEDERAL USER CHARGES August 1993 From the standpoint of both efficiency and equity, assessing responsible parties to com- pensate for damages is preferable to assessing current users for damages that others have caused in the past. Where possible, the gov- ernment does seek compensation from the firms that caused the damage; but in many cases recoveries may be small because the of- fender is unknown or unidentifiable, no longer in business, or has insufficient assets to pay for damages. If the government is able to col- lect, the monies are deposited in the trust funds set up for the purpose.7 7. In the case of the Black Lung program, funds to com- pensate for damages may come from the general fund, the trust fund, or a former employer, depending on the date of the miner's last employment and the date the claim was filed. See Noto and Talley, Excise Tar Financing, p. 15. The ideal approach, however, ignores the difficulty that may be involved in collecting damages from responsible parties, which (as- suming they do not go out of business) can in- clude extensive legal costs and long delays. The next-best approach is to levy liability- based excise taxes that substitute for insur- ance premiums and reflect the potential exter- nal costs of the product, as in the case of the excise taxes on vaccines. But this approach requires general fund financing of past dam- ages, which at times may be politically less ac- ceptable than taxing specific industries. The compromise is a tax that is loosely cor- related to the benefit or liability it finances, as in the case of Superfund. Such a tax may be politically more acceptable than a broad-based tax and more feasible and easier to administer than an attempt to recover damages (or collect a fee), even though, as a user charge, it is less than ideal because payments by firms do not correspond closely to the social costs of their activities. Chapter Three User Charges, the Congress, and the Courts he practice of charging for government services is longstanding and has at times raised legal issues. Much of the debate over user charges and many of the le- gal challenges to them have focused on the distinction between fees and taxes. The dis- tinction is unimportant from an economic standpoint (see Chapter 2). From a legal and a political standpoint, however, the distinc- tion between fees and taxes and the definition of revenue measures are significant because they may bear on the constitutionality of cer- tain charges and on jurisdictional issues with- in the Congress. In the last 10 years, the Congress has en- acted many new fees, increased others, and set some precedents. Taking note of the trend, policymakers, the press, and the public have frequently asked whether fees are not often taxes in disguise. The fact is that some are, but most are not. The distinction between fees and taxes has a long history and has to do with issues con- cerning the constitutional delegation of legis- lative authority to executive agencies. Over the years, the Supreme Court and lower courts have heard challenges to many fees, handed down decisions that clarified the distinctions between fees and taxes, and issued criteria for drafting user charge legislation that meets constitutional requirements. The courts have ruled that: o The legal distinction between fees and tax- es is based on whether charges are levied for purely private benefits, or whether they confer public benefits that are inde- pendent of, rather than incidental to, pri- vate benefits. o Regulation does not by itself constitute a service or benefit that provides a basis for assessing charges. But governmental ac- tion, such as issuing a license that quali- fies a firm to enter an industry, is a bene- fit.1 Regulatory charges for services that confer a private benefit, such as licenses or permits to enter an industry or engage in an activity, are fees. But charges for ac- tivities that confer a public benefit, such as regulation of radio and television broad- casting, are taxes. o The Congress may delegate to agencies the authority to levy charges that require pri- vate beneficiaries to pay for services that confer a public benefit, provided the Con- gressional intent to do so is clear and the guidelines for setting charges are ade- quately set forth in the legislation. Under these circumstances, the distinction be- tween fees and taxes is moot. Federal User Charge Legislation Many federal statutes impose user charges, but two have had particularly far-reaching ef- fects on federal policy and practice. They are Title V of the Independent Offices Appro- priation Act of 1952 (IOAA) and the Consoli- dated Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 1. Clayton P. Gillette and Thomas D. Hopkins, \"Federal User Fees: A Legal and Economic Analysis,\" Boston Uniuersity Law Review, vol. 67, no. 5 (November 1987), p. 829. 16 THE GROWTH OF FEDERAL USER CHARGES (COBRA-85). The first statute gave agencies broad authority to levy charges on identifiable beneficiaries for goods and services. The sec- ond broadened the basis for setting certain charges from reimbursement for specific bene- fits to financing all or a specified portion of an agency's budget. This led not only to higher fees, but to changes in the nature of the charges. Several of the fees set under the IOAA, and later under COBRA-85, provoked legal chal- lenges, In deciding the cases brought under these statutes, the courts elaborated on the distinctions between fees and taxes and enun- ciated the conditions under which the Con- gress may constitutionally delegate authority under its taxing powers to executive agencies (and thus permit them to levy fees on private entities that may provide public benefits). Federal User Charges Before the IOAA The federal, state, and local governments have been assessing charges for goods and ser- vices since the early years of the republic. These have included charges for the federal Postal Service, which was one of the original cabinet agencies and generated net revenues until 1820, and state and local charges for the use of public wharves, river locks, and similar facilities.2 By the beginning of the 20th cen- tury, federal agencies were charging for a va- riety of benefits and services. For example, the statute establishing the National Bureau of Standards in 1901 legally authorized charg- ing fees for calibration, testing, and other ser- vices. The federal government has been charging fees for grazing on public lands since the early 1900s. 2. General Accounting Office, The Congress Should Con- sider Exploring Opportunities to Expand and Improve the Application of User Charges by Federal Agencies, GAOIPAD-80-25 (March 20,1980). August 1993 The practice of charging visitor fees in na- tional parks began in 1908, when automobiles were first admitted to Mt. Rainier National Park. When the National Park Service was created in 1916, the Secretary of the Interior decided that revenues from the national parks should be sufficient to cover operation and maintenance costs and that the Congress should have to appropriate funds only for im- provement. At the time, five national parks were collecting revenues that exceeded their maintenance costs.3 The belief that user charges should cover the maintenance costs of certain facilities has been a recurrent theme over the years. In his budget message to the Congress for 1941, Franklin D. Roosevelt wrote: I have always believed that many facili- ties made available to our citizens by the government should be paid for, at least in part, by those who use them. For exam- ple, I believe that in the case of parks, na- tional forests, historic monuments, and so forth, small fees ... should be charged to those who enjoy them. A start on this policy has been made .... Another example is the $50,000,000 the government spends annually in the maintenance of dredged channels, buoys, lighthouses, lifesaving stations, and so forth. It would seem reasonable that some portion of these annual expenditures should come back in the form of small fees from the us- ers of our lakes, channels, harbors, and coasts.4 Throughout the period following World War 11, most budgets, regardless of which admin- istration prepared them, have urged levying a variety of user charges to help finance federal programs. 3.

CHAPTER THREE US ER CHARGES, THE CONGRESS, AND THE COURTS 17 The Independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1952 In 1951, the Congress passed a broad statute-- Title V of the Independent Offices Appropri- ation Act of 1952--authorizing federal agen- cies to set charges for goods and services by ad- ministrative regulation.5 This statute set a precedent. Before its enactment, an agency could impose fees only if it had specific Con- gressional authorization to do so. Background. In the early 19509, interest in charging private beneficiaries for federal ser- vices had begun to mount in both the House and the Senate. In 1950, the Senate Commit- tee on Expenditures in the Executive Depart- ments submitted a report on the feasibility of establishing fees in 12 operating agencies. The report concluded that the opportunity ex- isted for \"the equitable transfer of many finan- cial burdens from the shoulders of the taxpay- ing general public to the direct and special beneficiaries.\"G The report also made clear that the committee's focus was not on raising revenues, but solely on charging for services to \"special interests\" who received benefits \"at the expense of all taxpayers.\"7 The following year, members of the Sub- committee on Independent Offices of the House Committee on Appropriations con- cluded that regulatory agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Interstate Commerce Commission should assess fees to recoup the costs of hear- ings, inspections, and other activities related to granting franchises, construction and other permits, and licenses. Accordingly, the sub- committee added to the appropriations bill a section permitting each agency \"to appraise its own operations to see ...[ if] it would be pos- 5. 96 Stat. 1051, 31 U.S.C. 9701(a)(b) (1982). The IOU, originally enacted in 1951, was revised in 1982. The changes were minimal. 6. Senate Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments, Fees for Special Services, Report No. 2120 (July 20,1950),p. 15. sible to recapture for the government some of the costs\" connected with regulatory activities \"through the establishment of a schedule of fees.\"B The resulting provision, however, was not specifically related to regulatory agencies; its language was broad and applied to all agencies. The Statute. Title V did not compel agencies to institute user charges, nor did it replace, modify, or repeal earlier user charge statutes, which had set fees for specific goods or services on an agency-by-agency basis. Rather, it charted a parallel course. As a rider to an ap- propriations bill, the measure received scant attention at the time of its enactment, and the agencies were slow in responding to it.9 Title V stated that it was \"the sense of the Congress that any work, service, publication, ... benefit, ... license, permit, [or] registration ...p erformed, furnished, provided, ... or issued by any Federal agency ... to or for any person (including.. .businesses). ..shall be self-sustain- ing to the full extent possible.\" To that end, the IOAA authorized the head of each federal agency to prescribe by regulation \"such fee, charge, or price\" as may be necessary. The legislation stipulated that any fees set be \"fair and equitable, taking into consideration direct and indirect cost to the government, value to the recipient, public policy or interest served, and other pertinent facts.\"lo Title V of the IOAA is thus an open-ended piece of legislation that lays out vague and in- herently contradictory guidelines for setting prices. Charges set in order to make a service fully self-sustaining may not necessarily be fair. Similarly, charges based on direct and 8.

But more than 10 years passed before the first legal challenge to fees set un- der the IOAA surfaced, and more than 20 years passed before any cases reached the Su- preme Court (see below). Guidelines for Setting Charges. In 1959, the Bureau of the Budget issued a circular pro- viding administrative guidelines for applying the law. The circular stressed that user charges should be assessed only for special benefits provided to identifiable recipients, and it defined special benefits as goods or ser- vices above and beyond any that accrue to the public at large. Specifically, the circular stat- ed that the federal government provides \"spe- cial benefits\" whenever its products or services: o Enable an individual or business to \"ob- tain more immediate or substantial gains or values than those that accrue to the general public\" (such as receiving \"a pat- ent, insurance, or guarantee ..., or a license to carry on a specific activity or business\"); o Contribute to \"business stability\" or \"pub- lic confidence\" in a business activity (for example, \"inspection and grading of farm products or insuring deposits in commer- cial banks\"); or o Are performed at the request of or for the convenience of the recipient (for example, receiving a passport or visa).ll The circular required the agencies to sub- mit annual reports on user charges to the 11.

Bureau of the Budget. But the bureau made little use of the reports. In time, it changed the reporting period from one year to five and in 1974 it dropped the reporting requirement altogether. The federal government issued its last report on user charges in 1967. Attached to it was a memorandum from President Lyndon Johnson urging agency and depart- ment heads to keep user charges current and to support user charge measures pending be- fore the Congress. In July 1993, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a revised circular re- scinding the original. The revised guidelines not only apply to the user charges under the IOAA, they also provide guidance for the as- sessment of user charges under other statutes, to the extent permitted by law. Although the basic guidelines are similar, the revised cir- cular is more explicit regarding the factors that agencies should take into account in de- termining the federal government's costs of providing goods, resources, or services. Among the factors included in the revised, but not in the original, circular are an annual rate of return equal to the average long-term Trea- sury bond rate on land, structures, equipment, and other capital resources. The new circular also specifies that \"when a substantial com- petitive demand exists for a good, resource, or service,\" agencies should determine its mar- ket price using such commercial practices as \"competitive bidding\" or \"by reference to pre- vailing prices in competitive markets\" for goods or resources similar to those that the government provides (such as campsites or grazing lands). User Charges in the 1980s and 1990s: Fees Although the Congress had enacted specific fees before the IOAA and continued to do so afterwards, some new trends in user charge fi- nancing emerged during the 1980s, while oth- ers grew stronger. First, the legal basis for setting certain fees broadened from reimburs- ing an agency's costs of providing services to CHAPTER THREE USER CHARGES, THE CONGRESS, AND THE COURTS 19 financing all or a specified portion of an agen- cy's budget. Second, although the practice was established before the 19805, the tendency to levy fees that were like excise taxes or duties became more marked. Finally, the federal government's tendency to charge private beneficiaries for the costs of regulating certain businesses and economic activities in the pub- lic interest, while not new, increased. These trends became apparent after the en- actment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1985. The Balanced Budget Act specified a series of declining annual deficit targets and created an automatic spending-reduction process (known as sequestration) to assure adherence to the targets. Subsequent legislation--nota- bly the Refirmation Act of 1987 and, more recently, the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (BEA)--modified and extended the original targets and revised the spending-reduction process. With the passage of the BEA, the focus shifted from deficit reduction to spending con- trols. The BEA set limits on discretionary spending for programs funded through annual appropriations and divided discretionary spending into three categories: international, defense, and domestic. The BEA set dollar limits on each of the three categories through 1993 and on total discretionary appropriations for 1994 and 1995. To make sure that new en- titlement or receipt legislation does not in- crease the deficit, the BEA created a pay-as- you-go procedure that requires that decreases in revenues or increases in direct spending (spending controlled outside of the annual ap- propriations process) be offset either by in- creases in revenues or decreases in direct spending.12 12. For a fuller diecussion of the Balanced Budget Act and the BEA, see Allen Schick, Robert Keith, and Edward Davis, Manual on the Fedeml Budget Process, 91-902 GOC (Congreeeional Reeearch Service, Bud- get Agreement: An Interim Aeeeeement,\" CBO Paper (December 1990). These efforts to reduce the deficit sparked a continuing search for new or increased fees. The sequestration process, which under the BEA extends through 1995, involves auto- matic, across-the-board spending cuts. Each year, OMB issues a sequestration report that estimates deficit and spending levels and cal- culates any required reductions. If reductions are necessary, the President can issue an order for sequestration. Since 1985, the Con- gress and federal agencies have added fees both to reduce recorded agency expenditures and to make it possible fbr programs to expand without increasing net outlays or raising taxes. All of the budget reconciliation measures enacted from 1985 onwards contained signifi- cant new and increased fees. Provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985. If the IOAA was the first turning point in user charge legislation during the postwar period, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconcili- ation Act of 1985 was the second. Among its many provisions, COBRA-85 authorized the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to col- lect from its licensees annual fees equaling 33 percent of its annual operating costs; the Department of Transportation to charge fees that recovered the full costs of its pipeline safety program; the Customs Service to levy fees for processing passengers and convey- ances entering the country; the Federal Com- munications Commission to institute a system of revised user fees; and the Department of Commerce to increase fees for nautical and aeronautical charts and other products. By setting fees in relation to an agency's overall operating costs, rather than to the costs of providing particular services, the pro- visions relating to NRC charges set a prece- dent. Fees linked to an agency's budget, rath- er than to the costs of specific benefits, are more like revenue-raising measures than charges for services. With COBRA-85, the Congress for the first time established a statu- 20 THE GROWTH OF FEDERAL USER CHARGES August 1993 tory link between fees and an agency's bud- get.13 Earlier attempts under the IOAA at setting fees to recoup total budgetary costs had been struck down by the Supreme Court on the grounds that the measures exceeded the intent of the legislation, which was to charge for specific services to identifiable beneficiaries. When COBRA-85 was enacted, the NRC had been collecting fees under the IOAA that covered about 10 per cent of its costs. The Statement of the Managers accom- panying COBRA-85 explained that the NRC's authority to collect the new annual charge was \"separate and distinct from ... [its] existing authority\" under the IOAA in order to permit fuller cost recovery.14 The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986. Following the precedent set by COBRA-85, the Omnibus Budget Reconcili- ation Act of 1986 (OBRA-86) authorized the Coast Guard to charge fees for cargo ship in- spection and measurement; the Customs Ser- vice to collect fees for processing imported commercial merchandise; and the Federal En- ergy Regulatory Commission \"to assess and collect fees and annual charges ... in amounts equal to all of the costs incurred\" by the agen- cy in any fiscal year. In passing this legisla- tion, the Congress made no attempt to link fees to private benefits. Implicitly then, if any benefits accrued to the public, private benefi- ciaries would pay for them. The Customs Service fees levied by COBRA-85 and OBRA-86 also are typical of the trends in user charges in recent years. In addition to raising significant revenues-- amounting to $643 million in 1991--which are deposited in a Customs Services User Fee account, both fees are similar to taxes. The passenger-processing fee is in fact indistin- 13. For an analysis of the significance of COBRA-85, see Gillette and Hopkins, \"Federal User Fees,\" pp. 842-843. 14.

The fee, which is included in ticket charges, covers the costs of screening for health, immigration, and smuggling, but it may also provide funds to cover commercial expenditures otherwise covered by the merchandise-processing fee, which is deposited into the same account. The merchandise-processing charge was concep- tually closer to a user fee, but, as initially set, it brought in revenues that exceeded costs. In response to objections from the United States' trading partners, it was eventually modified (see Box 1).15 The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Acts of 1987,1989, and 1990. In recent years, leg- islation has strengthened the trends in user charge policies that began with the enactment of COBRA-85 and OBRA-86. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA-87) increased the National Bureau of Standards calibration and reference materials fees, ex- tended fee increases for the National Park Service, and established a fee for Internal Rev- enue Service (IRS) letter rulings and deter- minations that would vary with the type of re- quest. OBRA-87 also raised the portion of the NRC's operating costs that had to be covered by user charges from 33 percent to 45 percent for 1988 and 1989. The Omnibus Budget Rec- onciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA-89) extended the requirement through 1990 and put forth a revised schedule of FCC charges. Although it set no major precedents, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA-90) enacted more new fees and in- creased more existing fees than any single previous piece of legislation.

Customs Service User Fees and the GATT The Customs Service's merchandise-processing fee, enacted in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1986, raised an issue with the Unit- ed States' trading partners regarding whether its purpose was to cover costs or to raise revenues. The rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GAW) generally prohibit fees on imports unless they are \"commensurate with the cost of services rendered.\"l Import fees may not \"repre- sent an indirect protection to domestic products\" or \"a taxation ... for fiscal purposes.\"2 As initially set, the fee for processing imported merchandise was 0.22 percent ad valorem (according to its invoiced value) for the first year and 0.17 percent there- after. The rates were set to approximate the cost of sewices so as to conform to the rules of the GAW. But the United States' trading partners, particu- larly Canada and the European Community, found the charges excessive and improperly based and protested them to a GAW panel. In brief, the panel found that the fees exceeded the costs of services rendered and therefore were in effect a tax on imports that discriminated against them in favor of domestic products. In particular, the panel maintained that the ad valorem fee structure made it difficult to approximate costs be- cause import shipments of equal value would not necessarily have similar processing costs. The panel also found that, contrary to GATT rules, the Customs Service had included in its import- processing costs the costs of processing airport pas- sengers, collecting and transmitting export docu- mentation, processing imports exempt from the fee, and carrying out international affairs activi- ties of Customs officials stationed overseas. The panel issued its report in November 1987, and the GATT adopted it in February 1988. As a member of the GATT, the United States is obliged to abide by the international organiza- tion's rulings. The Customs and Trade Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-382) attempted to do just that. Because of the difficulty of estimating processing costs, the legislation maintained the ad valorem rate of 0.17 percent, but limited the amount of fees to a minimum of $21 and a maximum of $400. OBRA-90 gave the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to adjust the ad valorem rate from 0.15 to 0.19 percent to compensate for revenue short- falls or overruns. It also extended the merchan- dise-processing and other user fees through Sep- tember 30, 1995. OBRA-93 extended them for an additional three years. 1.

Ibid., Article VIE, l(a). 22 THE GROWTH OF FEDERAL USER CHARGES August 1993 lines and cruise ship lines transporting passengers to the United States, to offset the costs of the United States Travel and Tourism Administration (USTTA); o Set new fees for owners of recreational ves- sels more than 16 feet long using U.S. navigable waters patrolled by the Coast Guard. The Congress subsequently passed legislation repealing these fees in favor of a fee for using the Federal Maritime Com- mission's Automated Tariff Filing and In- formation System. The President signed the bill (H.R. 2152) into law on November 2,1992. The increase in NRC fees to cover the agen- cy's total budget authority exemplifies the trend in setting regulatory fees. The OBRA- 90 conference report made clear that the con- ferees intended the NRC to recover through annual charges whatever expenses it could not attribute to individual licensees or classes of licensees.16 Although most of the charges enacted under OBRA-90 are straightforward user and regu- latory fees, some are like benefit- or liability- based excise taxes or, in one case, like customs duties. Specifically: o The travel and tourism fee is assessed on commercial carriers at the rate of $1 for each foreigner entering the United States and is imperfectly related to services that visitors may receive from the USTTA. Public Law 102-395, enacted in October 1992, required the USTTA to charge users of its services, products, and information fees that would produce an \"additional $3 million to be deposited in the General Fund of the Treasury.\" o OBRA's abandoned mine reclamation fees, which are levied on owners of coal mines and are based on the number of tons of coal 16.

The fees on current production cov- er the cost of previous damages. o The act's tonnage charges are like customs duties, The charges are assessed against vessels entering the United States from any foreign port and are based on cargo- carrying capacity. In describing the pro- visions related to tonnage charges, the conference report on OBRA-90 uses the words \"duties,\" \"taxes,\" and \"fees\" inter- changeably. 17 User Charges in the 1980s and 1990s: Benefit- and Liability- Based Taxes The search for new sources of funds has also led to increases in dedicated taxes. Benefit- based taxes dedicated to trust or special funds have increased, but the increases marked no significant changes in policy. Most of the trust fund benefit taxes were originally enacted be- fore 1980: the Highway Trust Fund in 1956; the Airport and Airway Trust Fund in 1970; and the Inland Waterways Trust Fund in 1978. Since then, two new benefit-tax trust funds--the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund in 1986 and the National Recreational Trails Trust Fund in 1991--have been created. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund is financed with taxes on the value of cargo loaded or un- loaded at U.S. ports. The National Recrea- tional Trails Trust Fund is authorized to receive revenues corresponding to nonhigh- way recreational fuel taxes, but to date no funds have been appropriated to it. The Aquatic Resources Trust Fund, which pro- motes boating safety and fish restoration and was enacted as part of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, is a successor to the Boating Safety Fund, established by the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971. 17. Ibid., pp. 1026-1027. CHAPTER THREE USER ( ZHARGES, THE CONGRESS, AND THE COURTS 23 By contrast, the enactment of trust fund taxes dedicated to financing liabilities has been a pronounced trend in the past 15 years. The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, en- acted in 1978, was the first of these funds. The Hazardous Substance Superfund followed in 1980, and the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund was enacted in 1986. The Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund was enacted in OBRA-87, and the Oil Spill Liabil- ity Trust Fund in OBRA-89. The rates on many trust fund excise taxes have increased several times in the last 10 years. Most recently, OBRA-90 raised the rates on highway, motorboat, and rail fuels, but, in a departure from previous policies, one- half of the increase in motor fuels taxes is re- tained in the general fund through September 30, 1995. The remainder of the increase is dedicated to the Highway and Aquatic Re- sources trust funds. OBRA-90 also raised the rates on Airport and Airway Trust Fund ex- cise taxes and on Harbor Maintenance excise taxes. It also reimposed the LUST excise tax- es and extended Superfund through the end of 1995. Jurisdictional Issues in the Congress Within the Congress, user charges have at times provoked jurisdictional disputes be- tween committees in both Houses. In these in- stances, the focus of debate may be on whether the provision at issue is a revenue measure or on whether the charge in question is a fee, tax, or tariff (see Box 2). In recent years, the rules of the 'House of Representatives that govern jurisdiction over user charges have been in- voked more frequently. From time to time similar issues have arisen in the Senate, al- though the rules there are less explicit. In each chamber, the responsibility for dis- tinguishing between fees and taxes and re- solving jurisdictional issues between commit- tees rests with the Presiding Officer or Chair, who generally relies on the advice of the Par- liamentarian. The parliamentarians, in turn, have looked to the practices and precedents of the House or Senate and to relevant case law for guidance. Under the rules and precedents of the House and the Senate, the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Fi- nance, respectively, have jurisdiction over \"revenue measures generally.\"lB A review of the statements of the presiding officers in each body leads to a definition of \"revenue mea- sures generally\" that would include not only bills dealing with taxes and tariffs, but.provi- sions for broad-based fees, assessments, or other charges. Under the current rules of the House, the standing committees, other than Ways and Means, have no jurisdiction over tariffs and taxes, but may report out measures raising user fees, regulatory fees, and other charges. The Ways and Means Committee is entitled to a sequential referral of broad-based fees or other charges to finance activities that wholly or partially benefit the general public. The rules of the House--Clause 5(b), Rule XXI, first adopted on January 3, 1983, and subse- quently adopted at the beginning of each new Congress--state that a \"point of order ...[ may] be raised at any time against a provision in any bill or Senate Amendment ... [that] con- tains a tax or tariff measure, unless that mea- sure was reported by the Committee on Ways and Means.\"lg (A point of order is a parlia- mentary device that members of a body may use to question whether an action under con- sideration is in violation of its rules. The ef- fect of a sustained point of order under Clause 5(b), Rule XXI, is to delete a provision in a bill or an amendment automatically.) 18.

In most cases, the provision at issue would have di- rectly affected tax or tariff laws. But a provi- sion need not involve an amendment to the In- ternal Revenue Code or the Harmonized Tariff Schedule in order to meet the definition of a \"tax or tariff measure.\" For example, during the debates on OBRA-89, members of the Committee on Ways and Means for the first time raised points of order against certain pro- visions that levied fees (and, thus, necessi- tated no changes in the Internal Revenue August 1993 Code). In each case, the basis for the objection was that the fee was in effect a tax, and that the Committee on the Budget, which had re- ported the bill, had no jurisdiction over tax and tariff measures. The Chair sustained these points of order. Among the charges at issue were a fee of $20 a passenger on vessels engaged in the U.S. cruise trade or that offered offshore gambling and an annual fee of $1 per acre on the holders of Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leases. The proceeds from the passenger fee were to be de- posited in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Box 2. Jurisdictional Issues Surrounding Revenue Measures, Taxes, and Fees Jurisdictional issues involving user charges which have been interpreted to include provi- may arise in several contexts. Depending on sions not only for taxes and tariffs, but also for the context, the issue may center on whether a broad-based fees, assessments, or other provision is a revenue measure, a tax, or a fee. charges. In addition, under the rules of the House (Clause 5(b), Rule XXI), a parliamen- Article I, Section 7, of the Constitution tary challenge may be raised against tax or tar- states that revenue measures shall originate in iff provisions in bills or amendments proposed the House.

Thus, the meaning of \"revenue The power of the House to protect its institu- measures\" may be the critical factor in issues of tional interests is absolute. Thus, if, in its opin- committee jurisdiction, while the distinction ion, a Senate bill or amendment infringes on its between fees and taxes or tariffs may affect rul- constitutional prerogative, the House may pass ings on points of order. a resolution to that effect and return the bill to the Senate.

The Chair upheld the point of order on the grounds that the general public benefited from harbor maintenance and water safety and that charg- ing one class of beneficiaries for these services constituted a tax. The proceeds of the OCS fee were to offset the costs of environmental re- search and protection programs related to the oceans. The Chair held that the fee was a tax that would have financed general functions of government and provided no specific benefit to the leaseholders.20 The Chair made clear that, in distinguish- ing between fees and taxes, he would examine the nature of a charge, rather than its label.21 Based on case law, budget concepts, and mem- bers' arguments on the points of order, the Chair made the following distinctions between fees and taxes: User fees and regulatory fees ... are paid by choice in that the party paying the fee has the option of not utilizing the gov- ernmental service or avoiding the regu- lated activity and thereby avoiding the charge. Furthermore, fees are collected merely to compensate the governmental entity for providing the service, or ... for the expenses incurred in regulating the activity, such as processing the license application ...[ or] providing the requisite inspection, and are legitimate to the ex- tent that the services for which they are imposed are sufficiently particularized as to justify distribution of the costs among a limited group--the \"usersu--of the ser- vices rather than the general public. On the other hand, taxes are collected in order to raise revenue to offset the gen- eral costs of government as well as to off- set the costs of services provided to a more generalized group of beneficia- ries.22 On January 3, 1991, the Speaker of the House, elaborating on jurisdictional concepts related to Clause 5(b), made clear that the Committee on Ways and Means was entitled to referral of measures providing for \"broad- based fees:\" Standing committees of the House, other than the Committees on Appropriations and Budget, have jurisdiction to consider user, regulatory and other fees, charges, and assessments levied on a class directly availing itself of, or directly subject to, a governmental service, program, or activ- ity, but not on the general public .... The fee must be paid by a class benefiting from the service, program, or activity, or being regulated by the agency .... The fund that receives the amounts collected is not itself determinative of the existence of a fee or a tax. The Committee on Ways and Means has jurisdiction over revenue mea- sures generally ... is entitled to an appro- priate referral of broad-based fees and could choose to recast such fees as excise taxes .... The Chair intends to coordinate these principles with the Committee on the Budget and the Congressional Budget Office ... so that budget scorekeeping does not determine ... committee jurisdiction.23 In the Senate, the rules governing jurisdic- tion are less explicit. Thus, the basis for jurisdictional determinations is less clear. Again, when a bill is introduced, the Presiding Officer, on the advice of the Parliamentarian, refers it to the committee that has predomi- nant jurisdiction. Although many legislative measures contain proposals that cut across committee jurisdictions, sequential referrals are in order only under limited circumstances and in practice are rare. Thus, the decision on the jurisdiction of a bill may turn on certain provisions to the exclusion of others. The Committee on Finance has sole jurisdiction over measures dealing with taxes, and from 20. Congressional Record, October 4,1989, pp. H6619-6622. 21.

User Charges and the Courts Two issues have dominated legal challenges to user charges: the distinction between fees and taxes and the delegation of legislative func- tions. Over the years, decisions of the Su- preme Court and lower courts have drawn dis- tinctions between fees and taxes and have set forth the conditions for the constitutional dele- gation of legislative functions. The rulings of the courts, particularly in recent years, pro- vide the Congress with clear guidelines for drafting legislation that give agencies broad authority to impose fees. The Constitution vests all legislative pow- ers in the Congress of the United States;25 au- thorizes the Congress to make all laws \"neces- sary and proper\" for executing its powers; re- serves to the Congress certain powers, includ- ing the powers to tax, to levy duties, imposts and excises, and to regulate commerce;26 and prohibits the states, without the consent of the Congress, from levying any duties or imposts on imports or exports or imposing any duty on tonnage.27 The Congress may not transfer to others its essential legislative functions;ss however, it may delegate authority to carry out legislative policy if it also enacts sufficient standards to guide an agency's actions and to 24. See, for example, Congressional Record, December 10, 1987, p. S17712. 25. The Constitution of the United States, Article I, Sec- tion 1. 26. Ibid., Article I, Section 8. 27. Ibid., Article I, Section 10, Clauses 2 and 3. 28. Ibid. make it possible for a court to determine whether an agency has followed Congres- sional policy.29 The validity of a statute that levies a charge or empowers an agency to do so may depend on whether the charge in question is a fee, tax, duty, excise, or impost, as the courts have de- fined these terms. Based on the constitutional enumeration of legislative powers, the courts have consistently looked upon fees as distinct from taxes, duties, excises, and imposts. Thus, the issue of whether a charge is permissible under the commerce or duty of tonnage clauses, or whether a legislative delegation of power is constitutional, may arise in the case of a tax, duty, excise, or impost, but not in the case of a fee. The Issue of Fees Versus Taxes Before 1950 More than a century ago, the Supreme Court established precedents for distinguishing be- tween fees--or charges for the use of property or services rendered--and taxes or duties, im- posed as a matter of sovereign right. The distinction between fees and taxes first surfaced as a legal issue in the 19th century in the case of Packet Company v. Keokuk (1877). That case dealt with the question of whether the city of Keokuk's charges for use of its wharves, based on the tonnage of the vessels, was an unconstitutional tax, impost, or excise on the use of interstate commerce or a viola- tion of the prohibition on the right of states to assess tonnage duties. In this instance, the city's charges, although based on tonnage, were set to cover no more than the interest on the debt incurred for building and maintain- ing the wharf. ', 29. Hampton & Company v. United States, 276 U.S. 394 (1928) 409; Panama Refining Company v. Ryan. 293 U.S. 388 (1935); Schechter Poultry Company u. United States. 295 U.S. 495 (1935); Yakus u. United States, 321 U.S. 414 (1944). CHAPTER THREE USER CHARGES, THE CONGRESS, AND THE COURTS 27 The Supreme Court agreed with the plain- tiff that, if the charge could be considered a tax, impost, or duty, it would be unconstitu- tional. It then considered the nature of the charge and concluded that providing a wharf at which vessels \"may conveniently load or unload is rendering them a service,\" and that a \"charge for services rendered, or for conve- niences provided, is in no sense a tax or duty.\" The Court distinguished between a tax or duty \"imposed by virtue of sovereignty\" and a fee for services or use of property \"claimed in right of proprietorship.\"30 Two years later, the' Supreme Court upheld similar charges for the use of wharves at the port of St. Louis. The Court held that the charges were \"not out of proportion to the ad- vantages and benefits enjoyed,\" nor did the fees seem to be \"exacted for the purpose of in- creasing the general revenue of the city be- yond what was necessary to meet its out- lay ... in maintaining its wharves.\"31 In 1886 and again in 1935, the Court considered simi- lar cases and reached similar conclusions. Legal Challenges to Fees Under the IOAA The application of Title V of the IOAA brought forth new legal challenges to user charges. In general, the constitutionality of the statute was challenged, but the ultimate resolution of most cases rested on the meaning of the law. The constitutional issue centered on whether the charge or charges in question represented an appropriate delegation of authority from the Congress to the Executive. In other words, had the Congress validly delegated authority 30. Packet Company v. Keokuk, 95 U.S. 80 (1877). For a fuller discussion of the case, see David R. Siddall, \"Ap- plication of Constitutional Delegation Standards Based Upon the 'Fee' or Tax' Dichotomy\" (Congressional Re- search Service, June 23, 1982); also. Howard M. Zaritaky, \"Legal Distinction Between a Tax and a Fee\" (Congressional Research Service, April 6, 1981). 31. Packet Company v. St. Louis, 100 U.S. 423 (1879) 429. See also Siddall, \"Application of Constitutional Delega- tion Standards.\" reserved to it under the Constitution and, if so, had it provided the agency or agencies with sufficient standards to guide their determina- tions? The statutory issue focused the scope of agency authority under the IOAA. Had Title V, in effect, delegated to the agencies discre- tionary authority to impose taxes; or had it merely authorized the agencies to levy fees for service? By focusing on the narrower issue of the statute's meaning, rather than on the broader constitutional issue of the delegation of legislative functions, the Supreme Court further refined the distinctions between fees and taxes. The Federal Communications Commission's fee schedules were the first to face a major le- gal challenge under the IOAA. The FCC had begun collecting filing fees in 1964 to recover from applicants a portion of the costs of issu- ing them radio licenses. The plaintiff argued that the FCC's charges were an unconstitu- tional delegation of power from the Congress to the Executive on several counts. Prominent among these was the contention that the stan- dards set forth in the statute were so diverse and conflicting that they effectively placed no limits on administrative discretion. In Aeronautical Radio, Inc. v. United States, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit rejected the plaintiffs argument that Title V was an unconstitutional delegation of legisla- tive power and upheld the fees.32 The Court held that the standards of fairness and equity in Title V, \"taking into consideration direct and indirect cost to the government, value to the recipient, [and] public policy.. . to be served,\" were sufficient to meet the require- ment for a constitutional delegation of pow- er.33 The Court also held that the FCC's fees 32.

In general, the courts have upheld broad legislative dele- gations of power to federal agencies. The decision in Aeronautical Radio, Znc. 0. United States cited several precedents, including Yakus 0. United States, 321 U.S. 414 (1944), Panama Refining Company u. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388 (19351, and Schechter Poultry Company u. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935). See also Miatretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361 (1988). 28 THE GROWTH OF FEDERAL USER CHARGES August 1993 were consistent with Congressional policy and the petitioners had failed to demonstrate that the fees were arbitrary or that the FCC had exceeded its authority or disregarded guide- lines. In the early 1970s, the FCC again had to de- fend its fee schedules in the courts. The FCC's initial fees had been nominal, but, in the late 1960s, the Bureau of the Budget and the Con- gress urged higher fees to support the FCC's activities fully so that taxpayers would \"not be required to bear any part of the load in view of the profits regulated\" by the agency.34 Re- sponding to these pressures, the FCC in 1970 issued a schedule of fees designed to recoup all of the agency's regulatory costs from charges on licensees. The FCC's new and less specific schedule of fees was unable to withstand legal challenge. The case against the fees rested on the basis for setting charges and the distinctions be- tween public and private benefits. The new FCC charges included fees designed to recover all indirect and direct costs involved in su- pervising community antenna television systems. The Supreme Court invalidated the fees. In National Cable Television Association v. United States (1974),35 the Court said that payment of a fee implied a benefit of value to the recipient and was \"incident to a voluntary act,\" such as \"a request that a public agency permit an applicant to practice law or medi- cine or construct a house or run a broadcast station.\"36 The decision clearly stated that payments unrelated to benefits received by the payer are taxes, not fees, and hence not au- thorized under the IOAA. The Court upheld the right of the FCC to charge fees under the IOAA as long as the fees were directly related to services that directly benefited the regu- 34.

Ibid.. 340. lated parties. The FCC's fees, however, had been based on its total cost of regulating the industry. In the view of the Court, the main function of the FCC was \"to safeguard the pub- lic interest in the broadcasting activities of members of the industry.\"37 Assessments that recouped the FCC's oversight costs, in ef- fect, required broadcasters to pay for \"the pro- tective services rendered the public.\"38 Such assessments were taxes. The Supreme Court therefore directed the FCC to revise its fee schedule. In reaching its decision, the Court read Title V of the IOAA \"narrowly as autho- rizing not a tax, but a fee,\" and thus deliber- ately avoided the broader constitutional issue of the transfer of legislative powers.39 A similar ruling resulted from a companion case, which challenged annual charges that the Federal Power Commission had levied on natural gas companies and electric utilities to recover some of its costs in administering the Federal Power and Natural Gas acts. In Fed- eral Power Commission u. New England Power Company (1974), the Supreme Court held that the IOAA authorized only specific charges for specific services to identifiable recipients, not general assessments on entire industries.40 The Court cited the Bureau of the Budget's cir- cular, which stated that charges should not be levied \"when the identification of the ultimate beneficiary is obscure and the service can be considered primarily as benefiting broadly the general public.\"41 In brief, the courts, citing the legislative history of the IOAA, have ruled that the stat- ute authorizes agencies to collect fees, but not taxes, and that charges under the IOAA are permissible for goods or services provided to specific, private beneficiaries. The connection 37. bid., 341. 38. bid. 39. Ibid., 341-342. 40. Federal Power Commission v. New England Power Com- pany, 415 U.S. 345 (1974). 41. Executive Office of the President, Bureau of the Budget, \"User Charges.\" CHAPTER THREE USER CHARGES, THE CONGRESS, AND THE COURTS 29 between fee and benefit must be clear and di- rect and the public benefits, if any, must be purely \"incidental\" to the private benefits. If the public and private benefits are distin- guishable and \"independent,\" then, to the de- gree that a private entity pays for benefits that extend to the public, the charge is a tax. In Central and Southern Motor Freight Tariff Association v. the United States, the D.C. Cir- cuit Court defined \"incidental\" as the ant- onym of \"independent.\"42 Legal Decisions on Licensing Fees Court decisions have indicated that the pro- cess of regulation by itself confers no benefit that would provide a basis for charging fees. But governmental action that qualifies a firm to enter an industry, such as issuing a permit or a license, is a benefit.43 In the case of broadcast licenses, the issues are clear-cut. In issuing a license, the FCC grants the licensee a monopoly protected by federal law. In Mississippi Power and Light v, U.S. Nu- clear Regulatory Commission (1979), the Fifth Circuit Court indicated that a license confers benefits under virtually any circumstances. The petitioners argued that since any firm could establish a nuclear plant, market failure was not an issue; therefore, government regu- lation served no purpose other than to protect the public. The Fifth Circuit, however, ruled that \"a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is an absolute prerequisite to operating a nuclear facility.\"44 Thus, the license conferred a special benefit and consti- tuted sufficient basis for charging a fee. The decision enumerated some of the benefits that result from being licensed, such as the possi- bility that inspections might provide addi- tional information on safety methods and pro- cedures. But the crux of the decision was that if a firm voluntarily enters an industry, it assumes all associated obligations, including payment of fees. Legal Challenges to Fees Under COBRA-85 Since 1985, the most significant legal chal- lenges to user charges have turned on the right of the Congress to delegate authority un- der its taxing powers to executive agencies. Following the NRC's adoption of the fees authorized in the Consolidated Budget Rec- onciliation Act of 1985, 31 nuclear power reac- tor licensees challenged the fees on the grounds that requiring the NRC to assess the annual charge constituted an unconstitutional delegation of the Congress's taxing power. In Florida Power and Light Company et al. v. United States, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected the utilities' argument and upheld the NRC's rule.45 42. The distinction between \"incidental\" and \"independent\" public benefits was first made in a decision of the D.C. Circuit Court striking down an FCC fee schedule of 1975. In Electronic Industries Association u. FCC (1976), the D.C. Circuit Court stated: \"Expeneee incurred to serve some independent public interest cannot ... be in- cluded in the cost basis for a fee, although the Commis- sion ie not prohibited from charging ... the full cost of ser- vices rendered to an applicant which also result in some incidental public benefits.\" 554 F.2d 1115 (D.C.

Recouoment of Regulatory Costs In upholding the NRC's fees, the court ob- served that the Supreme Court's decisions in National Cable and New England Power were based on the statute and legislative history of the IOAA.

The utilities asked the Supreme Court to review the Florida POW- er and Light decision. On May 1, 1989, the court, having decided a similar case--Skinner v. Mid-America Pipeline Company (MAPCOJ- a few days earlier, declined. In MAPCO, the Supreme Court indicated that when fees are set not under the IOAA but by specific legislation, the guiding principle would be whether the Congress intended pri- vate beneficiaries to pay for public benefits and, if so, whether it had appropriately dele- gated powers to the Executive.47 The case in- volved pipeline safety user fees. In COBRA-85, the Congress gave the Sec- retary of Transportation the authority to set fees to cover the costs of administering the Pipeline Safety Act. The fees were to be re- lated to usage and the Secretary was given the authority to set a schedule based on volume- miles, miles, revenues, or a combination. The Secretary set the schedule based on mileage, since it was most closely related to the cost of inspecting the pipelines. Mid-America Pipe- line argued that because pipeline safety regu- lations confer public benefits, the fees were in fact taxes and the provisions authorizing the fees represented an unconstitutional delega- tion of the Congress's taxing powers to an ex- ecutive agency. MAPCO contended that dele- gation of authority under the taxing power re- quired stricter guidelines than other Congres- sional delegations of authority. After hearing the case, the Supreme Court ruled unani- mously against MAPCO, reversing the deci- sion of the U.S. District Court for the northern district of Oklahoma. The Supreme Court's decision rested on the principle that although the power to tax is re- served to the Congress under the constitution, the Congress may delegate discretionary au- thority if it also enacts sufficient standards to guide an agency in exercising that authority. In upholding the pipeline safety user fees, the Supreme Court ruled that even if the user fees were a form of taxation, the legislative intent to recover costs of services that did not directly benefit the regulated parties was clear and the legislative guidelines for doing so were ade- quate. In fact, the courts had upheld delega- tions of legislative authority when the legisla- tive guidelines were considerably less spe- cific.48 The more salient issue in the MAPCO case was not whether the pipeline user fee legisla- tion met the normal requirements for delega- tion of authority, but whether the history and text of the Constitution, the past practices of the Congress, and the previous decisions of the Supreme Court provided a basis for subjecting delegation of authority under the taxing pow- er to a stricter standard than under the other enumerated powers. The Supreme Court found no basis to support a dual standard and thus found the delegation of authority consti- tutional. Having done so, the Court saw no reason to address the issue of whether the pipeline safety user charges were fees or taxes. 46. 415 U.S. 336 (19741,341. 'I 48.

Chapter Four User Charges and the Budget he current budgetary environment en- courages appropriation committees to levy fees and deduct them from out- lays, rather than credit them to federal rev- enues. This practice became more widespread after the enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1985 and, five years later, of the Budget Enforcement Act (BEA). In 1967, a commission appointed by the President issued recommendations on budget concepts, including the budgetary treatment of federal collections. Although Executive and Congressional agencies have since followed these recommendations in principle, in prac- tice, legal provisions and administrative pro- cedures have at times departed from them, es- pecially in recent years. Today, user charges may be critical in meeting deficit reduction targets without cutting back on programs. Consequently, the budgetary treatment of many user charges has changed. Classifying Items in the Budget Apart from proceeds of borrowing, all collec- tions flowing from the public to the federal government are classified in the budget as governmental receipts (revenues) or as offsets against outlays (expenditures). Budget Nomenclature The guidelines for assigning budget items to the revenue or spending side are relatively straightforward, but the terms are confusing and likely to vary with the user. For example, governmental receipts--which generally con- sist of taxes, customs duties, and miscella- neous collections, including some fees--are also known as \"budget receipts\" and are re- ferred to in Congressional budget resolutions as \"federal revenues.\" The general term for funds credited against outlays is \"offsetting collections.\" Offsetting collections include interest, miscellaneous recoveries and refunds, and a wide variety of I fees. Offsetting collections show up in the budget in two different ways. Reimbursements to Appropriations. In some cases, the law specifies that a collection be offset within an expenditure account. Such collections are \"reimbursements to appropri- ations.\" Reimbursements to appropriations are deposited as credits to the expenditure ac- counts that they finance. Depending on whether the funds originate from inside or outside the government, budget documents identify reimbursements to appropriations as \"offsetting collections from federal sources\" (including trust and off-budget funds) or as \"offsetting collections from nonfederal sourc- es.\" (Commonly, reimbursements to are referred to simply as \"offsetting col- lections,\" thus adding to the confusion of terms.) Offsetting Receipts. If the law does not specify that a collection be assigned to an ex- penditure account, it will go into a receipt ac- count and be classified as an offset to budget outlays, not as a governmental receipt. Such collections are entitled \"offsetting receipts,\" and, if they come from outside the govern- 32 THE GROWTH OF FEDERAL USER CHARGES August 1993 ment, they are called \"proprietary receipts from the public.\" Offsetting receipts, includ- ing proprietary receipts from the public, ap- pear in the budget as negative outlays.1 User Charges Within the Budget Classification Scheme User charges classified as budget or govern- mental receipts include benefit- and liability- based excise taxes and some fees. User charges classified as offsetting collections, which may be either reimbursements to ap- propriations from nonfederal sources or pro- prietary receipts from the public, consist only of fees. All benefit- and liability-based taxes are recorded as budget receipts. About 1 per- cent of all fees also are classified as budget re- ceipts; the remainder are offsetting collections (see Box 3). The ratio of budget receipts to off- setting collections has changed little since 1980, but the nature of some of the fees that are now offset against outlays has changed. Recommendations of the President's Commission on Budget Concepts. In 1967, a commission appointed by the President recommended guidelines on budget concepts, including the classification for budgetary pur- poses of funds flowing to the federal govern- ment. The commission's most important recommendation was that a unified budget re- place competing budget concepts--which at the time included an administrative budget and a consolidated cash budget. Among its many other recommendations were several dealing with when to offset collections against expen- ditures and when to record them as budgetary receipts. At the time that the commission issued its report, the classification of a collection de- pended entirely upon provisions of law. Over the years, classification of items had become inconsistent and the commission sought to 1. For a discussion of offsetting collections, see Thomas J. Cuny, \"Offsetting Collections in the Federal Budget,\" Public Budgetingand Finance (Autumn 19881, pp. 98-99. Box 3. Classification of Collections from the Public Within the Budget: A Summary Funds flowing into federal coffers from the public may appear on the revenue side of the budget as governmental (or budget) receipts or on the spend- ing side as offsetting collections. Offsetting collec- tions include reimbursements to appropriations and proprietary receipts from the public. Governmental (or Budget) Receipts Taxes Income Individual Corporation Social insurance Estate and gift Excise, including benefit- and liability- based taxes, which are user charges Customs duties and fees, including some that are dedicated to trust funds and are user charges Miscellaneous receipts Taxes Deposit of earnings, Federal Reserve System Fines, penalties, and forfeitures Gifts and contributions Restitutions, reparations, refunds, and recoveries Regulatory fees Offsetting Collections Interest Realization on loans and investments1 Sale of government property Miscellaneous recoveries and refunds User fees Charges for benefits and services Rents Royalties Sales of products Regulatory fees that are required by law to be classified as offsetting collections 1. Only loan repayments before 1992 are recorded as , offsetting collections. Under credit reform account- ing, repayments of loans made after 1991 are not in- cluded in the budget totals; only the subsidy costs of loans made after 1991 are included in the budget to- tals. CHAPTER FOUR USER CHARGES AND THE BUDGET 33 remedy the problem. The commission exam- ined the nature of a collection to determine its classification. Specifically, the commission recommended that collections from activities that were \"essentially governmental in char- acter, involving regulation or compulsion, should be reported as receipts.\"2 But collec- tions associated with activities \"operated as business-type enterprises,\" or that were \"market-oriented\" should be included as off- sets to related expenditures3 The commission distinguished between fees and levies charged for the \"primary purpose of channeling the private demand for, and use of, valuable re- sources or materials that happened to be owned by the government\" and \"taxes de- signed to raise revenues for the government,\" or fees that were \"incidental to government regulatory activities.\"4 The basis for the dis- tinction was the commission's conviction that budget receipts should reflect the activities that the government engages in by virtue of its powers as a sovereign state. advances; receipts of government enterprises and enterprise funds; permits and fees; hunt- ing and grazing licenses and fees; interest, dividends, rents, and royalties; sales of pro- ducts; sales of government property; and fees and charges for services and benefits of a vol- untary character.5 The commission's recommendations were applied administratively (by Presidential di- rection) beginning with the budget for 1969. Thereafter, all collections except those arising from the sovereign powers of government were in principle offset against outlays. Where a provision of law authorizes the offset to occur within an expenditure account, the collections are reimbursements to appropriations. All other offsetting collections are offsetting re- ceipts. There is no real difference between re- imbursements to appropriations and offsetting receipts; both are offsetting collections.6 In examining federal collections, the com- mission identified the following types as basi- cally governmental in character and recom- mended that they be treated as budget re- ceipts: income, excise, franchise, and employ- ment taxes; customs receipts; social insurance premiums (the commission recommended clas- sifying those social insurance collections aris- ing from the government's sovereign powers as budget receipts and those arising from non- compulsory insurance activities as offsetting collections); payments of excess earnings of the Federal Reserve System to the Treasury; gifts and contributions; patent and copyright fees; judiciary fees; immigration, passport, and consular fees; and registration and filing fees associated with regulatory activities. The commission also recommended that the following types of collections be treated as off- sets to expenditures: repayments of loans and 2.

Classifying User Charges Although the commission did not address the question of what constitutes user charges, its recommendations provide a guide for classify- ing them. Following its recommendations consistently would involve offsetting user fees against expenditures (either as reimburse- ments to appropriations or as proprietary re- ceipts) because the fees are similar to charges for goods and services that the private market routinely provides, but that the government happens to own or control. Most regulatory fees and benefit taxes would be budget re- ceipts because they are charges for services or benefits that stem from the government's ex- ercise of its sovereign powers. In practice, the commission's recommenda- tions have usually served as a guide--at least to the extent that business-type fees are off- 5. Ibid., pp. Federal Budget,\" pp. 98-99. 34 THE GROWTH OF FEDERAL USER CHARGES August 1993 sets against outlays and taxes are always bud- get receipts. Although the commission's guidelines remain in force, provisions of law or administrative decisions are increasingly like- ly to intervene and lead to budget classifica- tions that depart from the guidelines. Legal provisions always take precedence. As a matter of administrative practice, the Office of Management and Budget usually fol- lows the guidelines, but may depart from them. When the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) makes an independent judgment on budget classification, it follows the guidelines. But if OMB departs from the guidelines in classifying an item, CBO normally accepts the OMB treatment. The tendency to offset regu- latory fees against outlays and, on occasion, to structure as fees charges that are much like taxes has been growing in recent years, par- ticularly since the passage of the Balanced Budget Act. The Budget Enforcement Act and score- keeping rules encourage further departures from the guidelines. The BEA imposes differ- ent rules for discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is subject to the annual appropriation process. Mandatory or direct spending (on entitlements, for exam- ple) is controlled outside of the annual appro- priation process and falls under the jurisdic- tion of authorizing committees. The BEA placed annual limits on discre- tionary spending and subjected mandatory spending to a pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) process, which requiresv' that any increases in manda- tory spending or decreases in budget receipts be offset by decreases in mandatory spending or increases in budget receipts. Thus, the Con- gress may increase funding for an entitlement program only if it cuts another entitlement or raises taxes, duties, or fees. Similarly, it may cut taxes only if it raises other taxes, duties, or fees or reduces entitlement spending. Under the BEA, combined changes in mandatory spending and taxation must not increase the deficit in any year. Any of the federal government's income that is a budget receipt--whether a tax or a fee--is automatically subject to the PAYGO process. Income that is recorded as an offset- ting collection may be discretionary or man- datory. A discretionary offsetting collection affects computations under the discretionary spending limits. A mandatory offsetting col- lection affects direct spending totals and be- comes part of the PAYGO process. Under current scorekeeping rules, a com- mittee that cuts spending in a program gets credit for the savings (and an increase in off- setting collections is treated as a decrease in spending). Thus, for example, if an appropri- ation bill reduces spending by levying fees and offsetting them against outlays, the savings will count against the annual discretionary caps. Moreover, if an appropriation bill re- duces outlays by increasing offsetting collec- tions in an entitlement program (or in some other way), the savings also will be credited against the discretionary caps.7 In other words, the savings are credited to the commit- tee that introduces the measure, rather than to the committee that might have jurisdiction over the program. This practice encourages the appropriating committees to reduce spend- ing. But it also alters jurisdictional bound- aries between appropriating and authorizing committees, blurs distinctions between \"dis- cretionary\" and \"mandatory,\" and encourages efforts to levy fees and offset them against out- lays, regardless of the nature of the charge. The only measures that are likely to be exempt from such efforts are provisions that actually amend the Internal Revenue Code, levy duties, or assess fines and penalties. Under the Congressional Budget Act, CBO monitors the effects of legislative activity, pe- riodically submitting to each house tabula- tions of levels of new budget authority, esti- mated outlays, and estimated revenues for the fiscal year in comparison with levels in the 7.

CHAPTER FOUR USER CHARGES AND THE BUDGET 35 concurrent budget resolution for the fiscal year. Trends in Budget Classification since the Mid-1980s Since the mid-1980s, the dominant trend in budget classification has been to offset against outlays as many fees as possible, regardless of their nature. Thus, many fees that if based on the recommendations of the President's Com- mission on Budget Concepts would be gov- ernmental receipts are now offsets against outlays. These fees are primarily for regula- tory activities. Consistency with budget concepts decreases as more regulatory fees are enacted and offset against outlays. Thus, although the official documents of the federal government main- tain that income arising from the exercise of the government's sovereign powers generally is classified as budget receipts,s in the case of regulatory fees the exception is proving to be the rule. In 1980, one-third of all regulatory charges were offset against outlays; the re- mainder were classified as budget receipts. By 1991, nearly three-fourths of all regulatory charges were offset against outlays; the re- mainder were budget receipts (see Table A-7). Several of the regulatory fees imposed since the mid-1980s have been offsets to outlays since their inception. Among them are: o The fees of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Department of Transportation's pipeline safety user fees. Both cover regulatory and inspection costs and are classified as proprietary re- ceipts from the public. 8. Budget of the United States Couernment, Fiscal Year 1993, part 2, p. 15. o The Environmental Protection Agency's pesticide registration and licensing fees, which are classified as reimbursements to appropriations and proprietary receipts, respectively. o The Federal Trade Commission's fees, which are classified as reimbursements to appropriations. (The Interstate Commerce Commission's fees, however, are classified as governmental receipts.) o The Federal ~ornkunication Commis- sion's fees, which are classified as propri- etary receipts. o The Department of Justice's immigration user and examination fees, which are clas- sified as proprietary receipts. (The De- partment of State's immigration, passport, and consular fees are classified as gov- ernmental receipts). o Customs Service user fees, which have been required by law to be classified as proprietary receipts ever since their enact- ment in 1986. (OMB sought to repeal the mandated classification because the fees, in effect, were customs duties. The Con- gress, however, chose not to enact the change.) With the exception of the FERC fees, which date back to 1984, all of the above fees were imposed in the years following passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1985. Some fees that were ofiginally classified as governmental receipts are now also offsets to outlays. For example: o Patent, trademark, and copyright fees, which were governinental or budget re- ceipts through 1982, are now credited to appropriation accounts. o The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's fees were classified as governmental re- ceipts through 1987, when they were re- classified as proprietary receipts. 36 THE GROWTH OF FEDERAL USER CHARGES August 1993 o The Security and Exchange Commission's registration and filing fees have tradition- ally been classified as governmental re- ceipts, but when they were raised in 1990, the increases were classified as propri- etary receipts. The increases were enacted in appropriation laws. The SEC registra- tion fee is based on the dollar value of the offering and is therefore much like a tax. Most of the proceeds of SEC fees flow into general funds, along with tax revenues. The remainder, which is subtracted from the agency's outlays, is smaller and amounts to considerably less than the agency's gross outlays. Total fees, how- ever, exceed outlays (see Chapter 5). Recently, OMB began describing some col- lections as \"offsetting governmental receipts.\" In line with the recommendations of the Com- mission on Budget Concepts, OMB distin- guishes between \"governmental receipts,\" which are \"collections from the public that re- sult from the exercise of the sovereign powers of the government,\" and \"offsetting receipts,\" which are \"derived either from business-type transactions with the public or from payments from one government account to another.\" OMB describes \"offsetting governmental re- ceipts\" as those that are \"governmental in na- ture but are required by law to be treated as offsetting.\"g The new term blurs distinctions in order to accommodate current practice. OMB is now calling the following charges \"off- setting governmental receipts\": immigration user and examination, FERC, Customs Ser- vice user, pipeline safety user, and tariff filing fees; and charges associated with reclamation facilities and the U.S. Travel and Tourism Ad- ministration. Interest in offsetting fees against outlays and, on occasion, structuring as fees charges that are much like taxes has grown recently for several reasons. Because increases in off- setting receipts or collections count as reduc- 9. Office of Management and Budget, Circular No. A-11 (1991), p. 67. tions in spending, a Congressional authorizing committee can meet its reconciliation targets by raising fees instead of cutting programs. For the same reason, the appropriations com- mittees can impose or raise fees to comply with the limits on discretionary spending. And, finally, although budget receipts can be earmarked by crediting them to a special fund or trust fund, offsetting the fees against out- lays may seem simpler and more direct. The Relationship Between Charging Users and Earmarking Funds The issues of charging for governmental ser- vices and earmarking funds are related, but separate. In the case of user charges, funds may or may not be dedicated to specific uses, but some relationship exists, by definition, be- tween the fee or tax imposed and the benefit or service provided. In the case of earmarking, the link between payment and benefit may be direct--as is usual in the case of highway tolls--or nonexistent --as when state lottery profits are dedicated to education. Earmarking funds and charging for gov- ernmental services raise similar concerns. Such devices may be means of promoting eco- nomic efficiency, or methods for eliciting sup- port for tax increases or the equivalent. Fiscal experts have argued that earmarking is poor policy, since it makes the budgeting process more rigid and inhibits proper allocation of revenues among competing uses. But dedica- tion of funds can also be much like the private- market practices of using the proceeds from the sale of goods and services to finance the costs of production. Thus, where specific fees or taxes represent payments for goods or ser- vices, which in turn are dedicated to funding the production or supply of the same goods or services, the charges may be both efficient (in terms of allocating resources) and equitable CHAPTER FOUR USER CHARGES AND THE BUDGET 37 Box 4.

Chapter Five The Growth of User Charges etween 1980 and 1991, user charges, measured in constant dollars, in- creased by 54 percent, reaching a total of nearly $120 billion. The relative impor- tance of user charges in the budget also in- creased. The growth, however, has not been uniform. User charges today finance a larger share of the budgets of some, but by no means all, programs. Practices vary widely in setting user charges. Many of the differences grow out of the diversity of the goods and services that the federal government provides. But programs that are similar in nature may not assess charges for goods or services in the same way or to the same effect. Thus, despite overall trends, some charges may encourage optimal use of scarce resources to a greater degree or may recover more program costs than others. Several major programs that have assessed user charges for decades set prices at below- market levels and are therefore encouraging less than optimal use of scarce resources, or are failing to meet operating and maintenance costs. Below-market prices are common in charging for the use of public lands and the raw materials extracted from them, and for some transportation services. Some programs are self-supporting, or near- ly so. Some are primarily involved in produc- ing and selling products, such as power. Others--the Postal Service, for example--sell services. These types of programs have tradi- tionally received most of their funding from their customers. More recently--primarily since the mid- 1980s--several regulatory agencies have de- rived most or all of their operating funds from user charges. A few regulatory agencies-- notably the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration--have set precedents by levying new fees and ear- marking the funds for program expansion. But in most cases--either through a change in law or administrative action--agencies are as- sessing fees for programs that previously had been financed from general funds. Here, too, practices have evolved over time and thus may vary, even for activities that are similar in nature. In some cases, the federal govern- ment may be collecting fees that fully recoup and even exceed its costs; in others, it may be partially recovering costs; and in still other cases, it may be assessing no charges at all. Nearly all federal departments and most major agencies levy fees for goods and services or operate programs that are financed by benefit- or liability-based taxes. Some depart- ments, such as Agriculture, Energy, Interior, and to a lesser extent Commerce, assess charges for a wide array of goods and services. Other agencies, such as the Department of Education, assess few and relatively insignifi- cant charges. Still others, such as Justice and State, also assess relatively few charges, but the collections that finance regulatory pro- grams often are substantial. A Note on the Data It is difficult to obtain data on the growth of user charges because there is no central, com- prehensive source of information. The Office of Management and Budget started collecting information on user fees from individual agen- 40 THE GROWTH OF FEDERAL USER CHARGES August 1993 Figure 2.

The GAO had a similar experience in trying to obtain information about user fees from the Departments of Commerce and the Interior.2 Collecting data on user charges from so many sources was beyond the scope of CBO's resources. Instead, CBO culled data from documents published by OMB and the Department of the Treasury, as well as from 1. General Accounting Office, User Fees: Limited Survey of User Fees at the Departments of Commerce and Interior (March 1990). p. 2. 2. Ibid., pp. 1-5. unpublished data, which these agencies sup- plied. When the nature of some collections was unclear, CBO sought additional informa- tion from agency staff. In the end, however, CBO strove not for absolute accuracy but con- sistency of judgment in determining whether or not collections were user charges. The data that follow indicate the level of us- er charges in 1991 and their growth in dollars and in relation to federal financial resources. Federal financial resources are the funds available to the government from budget re- ceipts (income taxes, social insurance taxes and contributions, excise and other taxes, cus- toms duties, and miscellaneous receipts) and user charges that are offset against (that is, subtracted from) outlays. Measures of growth in the volume of user charges from 1980 to 1991 are adjusted for inflation and are in 1991 dollars. The adjustment is based on implicit price deflators for gross domestic product (GDP). (See Tables A-1, A-2, and A-4 to A-9 for data in nominal dollars for each year be- CHAPTER FIVE THE GROWTH OF USER CHARGES 41 Figure 3.

The Big Picture, The growth in user charges between 1980 and 1991 far outstripped that of federal financial resources or GDP. Over the period, federal fi- nancial resources increased by 26 percent and GDP rose by 28 percent. By comparison, user and regulatory fees increased by 50 percent, reaching nearly $95 billion in 1991. At the same time, benefit- and liability-based taxes increased by 74 percent to $25 billion (see Fig- ure 2 and Table A-1).3 The substantial in- crease in collections reflects a continuing trend toward charging for some types of gov- ernmental services. The totals, however, mask the extent to which charges for other types of goods and services havekither stayed stable or declined. As a share of federal financial resources, us- er charges accounted for 10.5 cents of each dol- lar in 1991, up from 8.5 cents in 1980. Fees in- creased from 6.9 cents to 8.3 cents of each dol- lar of federal financial resources; benefit- and liability-based taxes increased from 1.6 cents to 2.2 cents (see Figure 3 and Table A-3). If the relationship of fees to federal financial re- sources had remained unchanged since 1980, 3.

And if the relation- ship of benefit- and liability-based taxes to federal financial resources had remained the same, collections in 1991 would have been $18 billion--$7 billion less than the actual amount. User Fees User fees--which consist largely of charges for benefits and services, rents, royalties, and sales of products--increased by 46 percent be- tween 1980 and 1991 to $90.8 billion. The in- crease, however, was not uniform. As a share of federal financial resources and in absolute dollars, adjusted for inflation, some types of fees increased, while others declined (see Fig- ures 4,5,7, and 8 and Table A-3). Charges for Benefits and Services Charges for benefits and services--which in- clude most business-type fees other than rents, royalties, and product sales--increased by 77 percent to $75.1 billion in 1991. As a share of federal financial resources, they rose from 4.6 percent in 1980 to 6.5 percent in 1991. The increase resulted largely from col- lections for postal services and insurance pre- miums, which together accounted for 57 per- cent of all user charges in 1991, up from 49 percent in 1980 (see Figure 6). Postal Services. Postal services, which ac- count for more than a third of all user charge collections, amounted to $42.6 billion in 1991, an increase of 58 percent since 1980. Postal services also increased as a share of federal fi- nancial resources from 3 percent in 1980 to 3.7 percent in 1991. Figure 4.

Percent Insurance. Although collections from insur- ance premiums have increased and now ac- count for more than one-fifth of all user charges, the data do not indicate either overall trends in charging for federal services or the budgetary significance of user charges. As a recent CBO study makes clear, only a detailed program-by-program analysis--which is out- side of the scope of this report--can reveal which insurance programs will be able to meet future claims and which are underfunded.4 Data on current premium collections are no measure of the problems of several programs, including not only depository insurance (the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal De- posit Insurance Corporation's Bank Insurance Fund, and the Federal Savings and Loan In- surance corporation's Resolution Fund), but pension insurance (provided by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation). Whether an insurance fund is in good or bad shape depends on whether current and project- ed income is sufficient to meet projected liabil- ities, not on whether premiums are growing in absolute terms or in relation to budget re- ceipts or program outlays. For example, in setting up the Pension Benefit Guaranty Cor- poration (PBGC), the Congress intended that it be self-supporting. The PBGC insures defined-benefit pension plans and thus guar- antees that employees receive pension bene- fits in the event that employers' assets are insufficient to pay for them. PBGC's annual premiums have exceeded outlays since its cre- ation in 1974, but premiums have not kept pace with the growth in liabilities caused by underfunded pension plans. PBGC's cumula- tive deficit was $2.5 billion in 1991; the agen- cy estimates that its cumulative deficit by the end of 2002 could amount to $15.7 billion and might be as high as $27.8 billion.5 4.

Penaion Benefit Guaranty Corporation, Annual Report 1992, p. 13. 44 THE GROWTH OF FEDERAL USER CHARGES August 1993 Federal insurance premiums, which amounted to $25.9 billion in 1991, increased as a share of federal financial resources from 1.2 percent in 1980 to 2.3 percent in 1991. Premiums from depository institutions ac- count for part of the increase; these amounted to 0.1 percent of federal financial resources in 1980 and 0.6 percent in 1991. As for the rest, the main charges were for Supplementary Medical Insurance premiums (Medicare Part B); health insurance for federal employees, retirees, and veterans; life insurance for fed- eral employees and veterans; premiums of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation; and disaster insurance, particularly federal crop and national flood insurance (see Table A-4 for a breakdown of insurance charges in nominal dollars from 1980 to 1991).

CHAPTER FIVE THE GROWTH OF USER CHARGES 45 programs are varied, not only in purpose, but also in design. Some, such as veterans' life, pension, and flood insurance, are generally fi- nanced from user charges; others, such as crop insurance, receive support from general funds. Charges for Other Benefits and Services. Charges for benefits and services, other than for postal services and insurance, account for a relatively small and unchanging share of total user charges--6 percent in both 1980 and 1991. These charges, which amounted to $6.6 billion in 1991, increased over the period by 37 per- cent in constant dollars, but in relation to fed- eral financial resources they were virtually flat, rising from 0.5 percent in 1980 to 0.6 per- cent in 1991 and fluctuating only slightly over the period (see Tables A-3 and A-5). In addition to postal services and insurance, fees for benefits and services include many of the more familiar collections for research ser- vices, technical information, maps, charts, and data; agricultural marketing and trade pro- motion services; administrative and auditing services; soil conservation and flood control; reimbursements for construction; admission to national parks; and use of recreational facili- ties. Subagencies of the Departments of Ag- riculture, Commerce, and Interior provide and charge for many of these services. Within the Department of Commerce, the collections of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad- ministration, the International Trade Admin- istration, and the National Technical Informa- tion Service increased during the 1980s. Col- lections for most other services remained rela- tively stable. Most of the charges for benefits or services are to specific individuals or businesses. Apart from postal services and insurance, pro- viding goods and services may be only one as- pect of the operation of an agency or a pro- gram; in these instances, charges would cover only a portion of an agency's expenditures. Without detailed program-by-program inves- tigation and analysis, it is impossible to deter- mine whether agencies are covering their costs of providing services or providing partial subsidies. For some programs, however, the situation is clear. For example, fees for the use of federal recreational facilities, adminis- tered by the Departments of Agriculture and Interior and the Army Corps of Engineers, are far below program and maintenance costs. The Forest Service manages 156 national for- ests; provides recreational facilities, including campsites; and maintains hiking trails. Apart from fees for campsite rentals, the facilities are free of charge, so that funding for manage- ment and maintenance comes largely from general tax revenues. The Army Corps of En- gineers administers recreational areas and charges nominal camping fees. Entrance fees to national parks constitute a small portion of the National Park Service's outlays for management of the parks and up- keep of the facilities. In many cases, rela- tively low fees result in overcrowding of the parks, congestion on park roadways, and in- creased pollution caused by heavy vehicular traffic. Raising fees to cover costs, however, might reduce access to a public resource. To date, the policy has been to subsidize the costs of park maintenance with general revenues. Rents, Royalties, and Sales of Products Rents, royalties, and sales of products, com- bined, brought in $15.8 billion in 1991 (see Figure 7). These charges represented 2.2 per- cent of federal financial resources in 1980, 2.1 percent in 1985, and 1.4 percent in 1991. They peaked at 3 percent in 1983, when rents and royalties from leases on the Outer Continental Shelf increased, and generally declined there- after (see Figure 8). Rents, royalties, and sales accounted for about 25 percent of all user charges in 1980, compared with between 13 percent and 15 percent in the past few years. (See Table A-6 for a breakdown of collections from rents, royalties, and sales in nominal dollars). Rents and Royalties. By 1991, collections from rents and royalties had declined by near- ly 50 percent from their 1980 levels to $4.2 bil- lion, nearly $3.2 billion of which was for royal- 46 THE GROWTH OF FEDERAL USER CHARGES August 1993 ties from exploration and extraction of re- sources from the Outer Continental Shelf. As a share of federal financial resources, rents and royalties accounted for only 0.4 percent of collections in 1991, down from 0.9 percent in 1980. Rents and royalties also are a declining share of total charges, representing only 4 per- cent of them in 1991, compared with 11 per- cent in 1980. Collections for rents and royalties may re- flect market demand or government policy re- garding charging for certain benefits. (The absence of a central source for data on user fees makes it impractical to try to determine which user fee rates are periodically reviewed and adjusted and which are not.) Falling oil prices have caused much of the decline in rents and royalties. Apart from OCS royal- ties, however, the decline also reflects a fail- ure to raise prices to correct for inflation, as with grazing fees for public lands and holding fees for hardrock mining claims on public lands (the latter are based on a law enacted in Figure 7. Rents, Royalties, and Sales of Products, 1980-1991 Billions of 1991 Dollars 30 1 1872). Fees for the use of federal lands for cat- tle grazing and the rights to exploit hardrock minerals are below market value and incon- sistent with many of the charges that the gov- ernment imposes on the rights to use other re- sources and extract other minerals. The federal government receives no royal- ties for hardrock minerals extracted from pub- lic lands, although it does get royalties for oil, gas, and coal. In addition, fees for hardrock mining claims are minimal. Under the Min- ing Law of 1872, prospectors could stake a claim and, for an annual development expen- diture of $100, could mine and sell minerals (such as gold, silver, and copper) from public lands without paying any further fees or roy- alties to the federal government. The annual expenditure requirement remained un- changed for 120 years. Public Law 102-381, enacted in October 1992, substitutes for the expenditure requirement an annual rental fee for 1993 and 1994 of $100 for each claim on federal land.

Sales of Products. In constant dollars, sales of products, which amounted to $11.5 billion in 1991, were fairly flat between 1980 and 1991. Over the period, receipts from sales of timber decreased by 38 percent and receipts from sales of minerals and mineral products dropped by 78 percent. The decline in miner- als receipts primarily reflects lower oil prices. Because of the sharp declines in mineral and timber sales, total sales of products by the fed- eral government have declined as a share of federal financial resources from 1.3 percent in 1980 to 1 percent in 1991. As a share of total charges, sales have declined from 15 percent in 1980 to between 10 percent and 11 percent in recent years. from the National Forests Fund and the For- est Service Cooperative Fund, primarily for timber harvesting and sales. In 1991, total timber sales from national forests of slightly more than $1 billion exceeded timber manage- ment, reforestation, construction of logging roads, payments to states, and other timber program costs by $200 million. In seven of the nine national forest regions, however, timber sales did not cover the government's costs of making the timber available for sale.6 Sales of power and other utilities by the De- partment of Energy and the Tennessee Valley Authority increased by 44 percent between 1980 and 1991 to $9.1 billion. Sales of pro- ducts other than timber, minerals, and power are relatively insignificant. Some of the Department of Agriculture's 6.

Regulatory fees constitute a small but growing share of total user charges, increas- ing from 2 percent in 1980 to 3 percent in 1991. As a share of federal financial re- sources, regulatory fees increased from 0.1 percent in 1980 to 0.4 percent in 1991 (see Fig- ure 10 and Table A-3). Regulatory charges include patent and trademark fees, inspection and licensing fees, and filing and registration fees associated with a variety of regulatory programs. Environmental and energy-related programs accounted for slightly less than one- fourth of all regulatory fees. Regulatory charges also include immigration user and examination fees, passport and consular fees, Customs Service user fees, Internal Revenue Service ruling and determination fees, and fees for legal services (see Table A-7). Major Developments Although regulatory charges remain a small portion of total fees, in recent years they have made some programs--and even some agen- cies--almost, if not entirely, self-supporting. Immigration and Naturalization Service Fees. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) has imposed three types of fees since 1986. The Immigration Legalization Fund, first authorized under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and scheduled to expire in 1994, provides financing for an amnesty program that permits illegal aliens to become legal residents. The program began in 1987. Collections from illegal aliens seek- ing to become legal residents peaked the fol- lowing year and, as expected, have since been declining. The INS also imposes immigration examination fees, which cover the costs of re- viewing, processing, and adjudicating applica- tions for anyone petitioning for residence in Figure 9. Regulatory Fees, 1980-1 991 SOURCE: Congressional Budget Office. CHAPTER FIVE THE GROWTH OF USER CHARGES 49 Figure 10.

The INS has been collect- ing immigration user fees since 1987. These fees--which come from a $5 assessment on air- line tickets for travel to and from the United States--pay for all immigration inspections at U.S. airports. All three INS programs-- immigration legalization, examination, and inspection--are fully financed from assess- ments. INS collections cover about one-third of its annual budget. Premerger Filing Fees. The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) jointly review proposed mergers and as- sess premerger filing fees for the purpose. The fees, which the two agencies split, went into effect in 1990 and cover all costs associated with reviewing proposed mergers that might act against competition.7 The Appropriations Act covering both the Department of Justice and the FTC for 1993 (Public Law 102-395) in- creased premerger filing fees to cover inflation 7. 15 U.S.C. 18. and pay raises since the establishment of the fees in 1988. Public Law 102-395 also re- quired the Attorney General to set fees to re- cover expenses of registering foreign agents and to recover the costs of confinement from any person convicted in a U.S. District Court and committed to the Attorney General's cus- tody. The fees are equal to the average cost of one year of incarceration. (Individuals jailed for less than a year can receive a rebate of a prorated portion of the fee. The Attorney Gen- eral can waive the fee or establish a lesser fee for persons who establish an inability to pay or who can demonstrate that a fee would unduly burden their dependents.) Passport, Visa, and Consular Fees. The Department of State's charges consist primar- ily of passport, immigration (largely visa), and consular fees. Passport fees have increased substantially since 1980, but collections fluc- tuate considerably from year to year. Collec- tions are likely to increase in 1993, when pass- ports issued for 10-year periods in the 1980s come up for renewal. (The 10-year passport 50 THE GROWTH OF FEDERAL USER CHARGES August 1993 was established in 1982; previously passports were valid for five years. As a result, passport renewals in the late 1980s dropped sharply, and so did fee collections.) Passport, immigra- tion, and consular fees are designed to cover the costs of issuing passports and immigrant and nonimmigrant visas and of providing con- sular services. Services for U.S. citizens over- seas account for about 40 percent of the cost of a passport. The Department of State reviews and adjusts its fees every five years. The most recent increase took effect in 1992. Patent and Trademark Fees. The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) is the main source of funds for the Department of Com- merce and accounted for more than two-thirds of its charges in 1991. A patent and trade- mark surcharge, enacted in 1990, alone yield- ed nearly $100 million in additional collec- tions in 1991. Collections by the PTO came close to meeting the agency's annual budget in 1991 and 1992. It expects to obtain all of its funds from fees in 1993 and 1994. The Department of Commerce is a dramatic example of the growth in fees as a source of program funds. Between 1980 and 1991, charges increased from $152 million, repre- senting less than 3 percent of the department's outlays, to $505 million, representing more than 16 percent of its outlays in 1991. The rise in charges in relation to outlays resulted both from keeping outlays down and from increas- ing collections from the public, mostly for pat- ents and trademarks. The collections of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis- tration, the International Trade Administra- tion, and the National Technical Information Service also increased. Treasury Department Fees. The Comptrol- ler of the Currency collected nearly $300 mil- lion for bank supervisory services in 1991. The main additions to the Treasury's fees over the last decade have been Customs Service user fees and Internal Revenue Service ruling and determination fees. Securities and Exchange Commission Fees. The Securities and Exchange Commis- sion (SEC) collects registration fees that sub- stantially exceed its outlays. In 1980, SEC registration fees amounted to about two-thirds of the agency's gross outlays. In 1986 and 1987, the share had climbed to well above 200 percent, and in 1991, was close to 150 percent. The SEC's registration fee is based on the dollar value of the offering, Thus, in its struc- ture, the fee is similar to a tax, and most fee proceeds flow into general funds, along with tax revenues. Beginning with fiscal year 1991, SEC appropriation acts have increased registration fees from 0.02 percent to 0.03 per- cent of the dollar value of the offering. The ap- propriation act for fiscal year 1993 (Public Law 102-395) authorizes the SEC, upon enact- ment of legislation amending the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, to collect up to $16 mil- lion in additional fees to recover the costs of registering, supervising, and regulating in- vestment advisers and their activities. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Fees. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC's) fees cover its budget authority. The NRC and its predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission, have been collecting licensing fees since 1968, based on the general authority granted to all agencies in the Independent Of- fices Appropriation Act (IOAA) of 1952 (see Chapter 3). In 1980, NRC's fees for license re- views and inspections covered 5 percent of its outlays. Beginning with the Consolidated Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA- 85), the Congress gave the NRC the authority to levy annual charges on the operation of nu- clear power reactors and thus to recover a larger share of its costs. Most recently, in 1990, the Congress authorized the NRC to levy licensing and inspection fees so that its budget is fully funded from fees. (The author- ity expires in 1996. Previous legislation--in 1985 and in 1987--had set the cost recovery rate initially at 33 percent and subsequently at 45 percent. In 1996, the ratio of coverage is scheduled to revert to 33 percent.) The fees levied under the agency's general authority cover specific licensing inspection services; an- nual fees levied on each reactor recover the cost of providing generic services to licensees, CHAPTER FIVE such as research, rulemaking, and develop- ment of regulations. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Fees. The Federal Energy Regulatory Com- mission's (FERC's) fees, levied under the au- thority of the Federal Power Act, the IOAA and OBRA-86, also fully cover its budgetary costs. FERC regulates interstate aspects of the natural gas, oil pipeline, hydroelectric, and electric power industries. Its regulatory activities include setting and approving rates, issuing licenses and certificates for construc- tion of facilities, and inspecting dams. (FERC regulates some 150 interstate natural gas pipeline companies, more than 9,700 natural gas producers, 130 common carrier oil pipeline companies, and more than 1,700 hydroelectric projects.) In addition to specific fees for re- viewing various filings under the IOAA, FERC assesses annual charges on hydroelec- tric licensees and on regulated oil, gas, and electric firms. (The authority to collect annual fees from holders of licenses to generate elec- tricity in order to cover the cost of administer- ing the program dates from 1920.) Each year, FERC reviews its program costs and makes adjustments, as necessary, so that its annual charges are equal to its budget authority, less fees authorized under the IOAA. Federal Communication Commission Fees. The Federal Communication Commis- sion's (FCC's) fees also cover a substantial share of its costs. The Communications Act of 1934 established the public nature of the radio spectrum. The FCC assigns licenses to private parties who use the radio spectrum and charges fees to cover the cost of the application and licensing process. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 gives the FCC authority to auction licenses to use parts of the radio spectrum. The use of the radio spectrum includes traditional radio and television broadcasting, cable television, satellite and microwave communications, and cellular telephones. The FCC's charges are based on authority granted the agency under COBRA-85. In 1985, fees covered less than 1 percent of the THE GROWTH OF USER CHARGES 51 FCC's costs; in 1989, fees covered roughly half of the agency's costs. More recently, the share has dropped to around 40 percent--a result of lower collections and rising outlays. The FCC's outlays in 1991, measured in constant dollars, were 8 percent higher than in 1980. OBRA-93 increases the fees that the FCC charges for regulatory activities. Some Recent Precedents Both the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have recently set precedents in levying fees and earmarking them for the purpose of program expansion. Environmental Protection Agency. EPA-- apart from administering programs funded by the Hazardous Substance Superfund and the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund--is responsible for regulating pesticides. This responsibility includes registering all pesticides to assess their safety and environ- mental impact. EPA charges a one-time reg- istration fee for reviewing the active ingredi- ents in pesticides and an annual fee to produc- ers, based on the number of reregistrations they hold. The fees go into a special fund for \"reregistration and expedited processing,\" set up in 1989, and are available for these pur- poses, without fiscal year limitation. EPA is using the funds to increase staff and improve its data management systems and internal procedures in order to expedite the processing of applications. EPA officials consider the ear- marking of its fees to have been essential in securing industry's support for them. When the program expanded, fees increased from $8 million in 1988 to more than $100 million in 1991. The fees nonetheless finance a small fraction (less than 2 percent) of the Environ- mental Protection Agency's gross outlays. Food and Drug Administration. In October 1992, the Congress authorized the FDA to im- pose user fees for drug certification and ap- proval. Building on the EPA model, these fees set precedents in both formulation and struc- ture. Under the new law, makers of prescrip- 52 THE GROWTH OF FEDERAL USER CHARGES August 1993 tion drugs will pay a one-time fee for each new drug application and annual fees for each fa- cility manufacturing prescription drugs and for each drug on the market. These fees are expected to bring in $330 million over the next five years. The new fees are the outgrowth of an agreement between the FDA, lawmakers and their staffs, and industry representatives. Under the resulting law, the FDA will dedi- cate the fees to hiring 600 new staff members by 1997 for the purpose of evaluating the safe- ty and effectiveness of new pharmaceuticals. The fees will be a reimbursement to FDA ap- propriations and will be available without fis- cal year limitation. In turn, the FDA has pledged to cut review times in half by 1997--to six months for high-priority drugs (such as those for AIDS and cancer) and to 12 months for all others. The FDA has committed itself not only to a series of five-year goals, but to a set of interim goals, which include eliminating its backlog of drug applications in two years and hiring half of its new staff members by the first quarter of fiscal year 1995. The goals are set forth in let- ters from the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to the Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee of the House and the Chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee of the Senate. The law requires the FDA to submit annual reports to the committees on its progress toward meeting its goals. Such high- ly specific earmarking of fees and agency com- mitments is unprecedented and accounts for the drug industry's acceptance of fees that it had previously opposed.8 FDA officials have estimated that it costs an average of $10 million a month per drug for each additional month that a product is held off the market. Thus, speedier approvals could mean millions in additional earnings to the in- dustry.9 All parties saw the fees as a reason- able approach to eliminating a growing back- log of drug applications and speeding up drug approvals in a time of budgetary constraint. 8. Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992, H.R. the cases of the EPA and FDA fees, indus- try and government moved from an adversari- a1 to a cooperative process in setting charges for regulatory services. Whether these cases signify a trend remains to be seen. The Current State of Regulatory Charges The trend toward charging for regulatory ser- vices has not affected regulatory agencies uni- formly. In the case of the SEC, charges exceed budgetary outlays; in the case of the FERC and the NRC, charges are roughly equal to an- nual outlays; in the case of the FCC, charges partially cover outlays; and in the case of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, fees are insignificant. In 1992, the Interstate Commerce Commission's fees covered about 12 percent of its outlays; the FTC's fees covered about 16 percent; and the FCC's fees covered approximately 40 percent (see Table 1). The proportion of FCC outlays that are covered by fees will increase when the provisions of OBRA-93 take effect. In some cases, the differences among agen- cies may reflect their varying functions; in others, the activities may be similar, but the policies toward charging for services may be different. For example, most depository institutions--thrifts, credit unions, and nation- ally charted banks--pay for the costs of exam- ining them. State-chartered banks regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) do not. In its budget for fiscal year 1994, the Administration proposed that state- chartered banks reimburse the FDIC for the 9.

Benefit- and Liability- Based Taxes As sources of funds, dedicated taxes based on benefits and liabilities are less significant than fees, but are growing rapidly. In 1980, three trust funds and one special fund ac- counted for nearly all dedicated excise taxes. By 1991, dedicated taxes were flowing into nine trust funds and one special fund. In 1991, collections of taxes dedicated to special pur- poses other than highways and airports and airways were more than 10 times greater than in 1980. Benefit-Based Taxes Taxes based on benefits amounted to $22.6 bil- lion and represented almost the same share of total user charges as in 1980--slightly less than 20 percent. Benefit-based taxes consti- tuted 2 percent of federal financial resources in 1991, up from 1.5 percent in 1980. Taxes based on benefits are dedicated to the fol- lowing trust and special funds: Highway, Airport and Airway, Aquatic Resources, Inland Waterways, Harbor Maintenance, and National Recreational Trails (which, to date, has received no appropriations). The largest share of benefit taxes is allo- cated to the Highway Trust Fund, followed by the Airport and Airway Trust Fund (see Fig- ure 11). The Highway Trust Fund, which dates from 1956, still accounts for more Yev- enues than a combination of all of the other trust and special funds that are financed by benefit taxes; in constant dollars, collections in 1991 were 57 percent greater than in 1980. The Airport and Airway Trust Fund dates from 1971; in constant dollars, its collections in 1991 were 60 percent greater than in 1980. The Highway Trust Fund accounted for 78 percent of taxes based on benefits in 1980 and for 75 percent in 1991. The Airport and Air- way Trust Fund accounted for 22 percent of taxes based on benefits in both 1980 and 1991. Of the $22.6 billion in benefit taxes collected in 1991, $17 billion went into the Highway Trust Fund and $4.9 billion into the Airport and Airway Trust Fund (see Table A-8). The other taxes based on benefits increased to $0.7 billion over the same period. 54 THE GROWTH OF FEDERAL USER CHARGES August 1993 Figure 11.

Financing for many trans- portation programs is appropriated from ex- cise tax trust funds--chiefly from the Highway and Airport and Airway trust funds, with smaller amounts from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund and the Boating Safety Account of the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund. Benefit- based excise taxes financed more than 70 per- cent of the Department of Transportation's outlays in 1991. In recent years, federal spending on highways has approximately equaled revenues from the trust fund.10 Charges for aviation services and use of the inland waterways are far below costs. Federal aviation revenues have consistently been be- low expenditures. Appropriations from the general fund finance about half of the Federal Aviation Administration's operations (includ- ing operation of the air traffic control system). Aviation excise taxes finance the remainder, 10.

CHAPTER FIVE including grants for airport improvements and airway system research, facilities, and equipment. General aviation aircraft pay a fuel tax and registration fees that cover a small portion of the costs that they impose on the system. Liability-Based Taxes The enactment of liability-based taxes in the past 15 years has represented a more pro- nounced departure from previous policy than the enactment of benefit-baaed taxes. Taxes THE GROWTH OF USER CHARGES 55 based on liabilities have been dedicated to trust funds--Hazardous Substance Superfund, Leaking Underground Storage Tank, Oil Spill Response, Black Lung Disability, and Vaccine Injury Compensation--that finance compensa- tion for damages to health or the environment. Liability-based taxes amounted to $2.5 billion in 1991, an increase of more than 450 percent since 1980. Starting from a small base, these taxes accounted for less than 1 percent of total charges and less than 0.1 percent of federal financial resources in 1980, compared with 2 percent of total charges and 0.2 percent of fed- eral financial resources in 1991. Chapter Six The Outlook ecent developments indicate a con- tinuing commitment to reduce the deficit and a strong likelihood that user charges will grow. Between 1980 and 1991, the growth of user charges outpaced that of gross domestic product and federal financial resources. In the same period, user charges, measured in constant dollars (1991 = loo), increased by 54 percent. If user charges continue to grow at the same average annual rate for the remainder of the 1990s, they could account for more than 12 percent of federal financial resources by the year 2000, up from 10.5 percent in 1991. Since 1985, budget reconciliation measures have included increases in user charges. Moreover, not only have user charges grown, but since the passage of the Consolidated Bud- get Reconciliation Act of 1985, the basis for as- sessing many of them has expanded. At one time, most user charges were limited to as- sessing private parties for special benefits; to- day, the objective, at least for some programs, is more likely to be total recovery of agency costs. Although user charges have increased sub- stantially, many federal programs continue to provide goods and services at no charge or at charges well below federal costs. Thus, the po- tential exists for further growth. The Omni- bus Budget Reconciliation of 1993 increased several user charges and imposed some new ones, and proposals for extending and increas- ing others are under consideration by the Administration and the Congress. In view of recent developments, further growth of user charges seems likely; it seems less likely that there will be new departures in charging for federal services. Such changes occurred only twice in the period following World War 11--when the Independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1952 and COBRA-85 were enacted. The Omnibus Budget Reconcili- ation Act of 1990 increased more user charges than any other single piece of legislation, but otherwise set no precedents. Neither did OBRA-93. Similarly, current proposals sug- gest no major departures from the patterns of the past five years. The potential for further growth of user charges, however, may be greatest in areas where growth was least evident in the past decade. The greatest growth in the past 10 years was in regulatory charges and in liability-based taxes. The areas of least growth were charges for benefits and services, other than for postal services and insurance; rents; royalties; and sales of products other than power. These charges include some of the more familiar user fees, such as entrance fees to national parks and recreation areas, fees for the use of federal lands, and charges for rights to extract natural resources from public property. In these and other areas, such as some transportation services--in par- ticular, inland waterways and aviation--the federal government has set prices below mar- ket value or is not recovering its operating and management costs. OBRA-93 increased some charges for federal activities related to land and natural resource management and trans- 58 THE GROWTH OF FEDERAL USER CHARGES August 1993 portation, and further increases are possible in the future through administrative action, as well as legislation. nication facilities located on federal lands under the control of the Secretaries of Ag- riculture and Interior; Charges for regulatory activities will prob- ably continue to grow, although at a slower pace. Whether future legislation will reflect a growing tendency to earmark increases in charges for agency expansion, as in the cases of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration, is an open question. Pending legislation (H.R. 2239) points to the possibility; it would more than double the Securities and Exchange Commis- sion's authorized funding level and permit the agency to use the fees it collects to cover agen- cy expenses. Most of the SEC's fees go into the general fund. Other proposed legislation would also set tighter restrictions on invest- ment advisors and permit the SEC to impose a fee on them to pay for additional oversight personnel. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 Following an established pattern, OBRA-93 imposed some new charges and increased or extended some existing charges. OBRA-93 in- cluded provisions to: o Auction licenses to use sections of the elec- tromagnetic spectrum; o Require the Secretary of Health and Hu- man Services to assess each state an ad- ministration fee related to the number of Supplementary Security Income payments that the federal government makes on be- half of the states and to charge for addi- tional services; o Increase entry and user fees for recreation facilities at sites under the control of the Departments of Agriculture and Interior and the Army Corps of Engineers; o Increase fees on operators of radio, televi- sion, and commercial telephone commu- o Increase inspection fees for imported tea; o Increase of the Federal Communications Commission's fees for regulatory activi- ties; o Extend through fiscal year 1998 the sur- charges on patent and trademark applica- tion fees, tonnage duties, and Nuclear Reg- ulatory Commission fees that had been scheduled under OBRA-90 to expire at the end of fiscal year 1995; o Extend through fiscal year 1998 the $100 annual holding fee assessed on owners of mining claims on public lands; o Extend Customs Service user charges through fiscal year 1988; o Extend permanently the vaccine excise tax, which expired on January 1,1993; and o Extend through fiscal year 1999 the addi- tional 2.5 cents a gallon tax on motor fuel enacted under OBRA-90 and, beginning October 1,1995, transfer its revenues from the general fund to the Highway Trust Fund (the additional tax on railroad diesel fuel was lowered from 2.5 cents a gallon to 1.25 cents, effective October 1, 1995; these monies will continue to go into the general fund). New Proposals In addition to the provisions in OBRA-93, the Congress is considering new or increased fees as part of appropriation or authorization mea- sures. Among the charges under consider- ation are proposals to permit the Library of Congress to levy fees to recover the costs of producing and distributing certain types of in- formation products (S. 345) and to increase the royalty fees paid by companies that mine CHAPTER SIX THE OUTLOOK 59 hardrock minerals on federal land. Both the Senate and the House have proposed such measures (S. 433 and H.R. 918), but the amount of the increase in the House measure is substantially higher. For its part, the Ad- ministration has proposed or is considering changes in land management policies that could result in higher fees for grazing on pub- lic lands, increased royalties for mining of hardrock minerals, and higher charges for fed- eral water resources. Measures that the Congress has recently enacted or is now considering--and proposals that the Administration is considering-- indicate that the trends of the 1980s and early 1990s towards increased user charge financ- ing are likely to persist. Based on their poten- tial, regulatory fees and liability-based taxes might continue to grow at a slower pace, while user fees and benefit-based taxes might grow at a faster pace. It is also likely that the Con- gress will emphasize increases in user charges over general fund financing to expand pro- grams that provide goods or services to private beneficiaries or that compensate for real or po- tential damage to health or the environment. Finally, the prospect of health care reform raises the possibility of imposing new user charges in the form of fees or dedicated taxes to finance some portion of the revised system. Appendix Data on Federal User Charges, he tables that follow provide data on federal user charges, by type, in nomi- nal dollars and as a share of federal financial resources for each fiscal year from 1980 to 1991. The data are drawn from the Budget of the United States Government for fiscal years 1982 to 1993 and the Department of the Treasury's Combined Statement of Receipts, Expenditures, and Balances of the United States Government for fiscal years 1980 to 1983 and Annual Report of the United States Government--Appendix for fiscal years 1984 to 1991. At times, fees for goods and services are difficult to identify in budget documents. Unpublished data provided by the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of the Treasury's Financial Management Ser- vice provided useful background and helped resolve some questions. In undertaking the study, the Congres- sional Budget Office's objective was to provide a reasonably realistic measure of the magni- tude and growth of user charge financing. The wide range of user charges, the broad scope of the project, and the absence of a central source of data made absolute accuracy, however de- sirable, an unrealistic goal. Because the data in the following tables are in nominal dollars, they exaggerate the real growth (or, in some cases, understate or mask the real decline) of user charges. Table A-3, which presents data on user charges in rela- tion to federal financial resources, is an excep- tion. In the text, measures of growth in the volume of user charges from 1980 to 1991 are adjusted fir inflation, based on implicit price deflators for gross domestic product (see Chap- ter 5). 62 THE GROWTH OF FEDERAL USER CHARGES August 1993 Table A-1.

NOTE: For consistency with the budget historical base, Customs Service user charges for the years 1986 to 1988 are included in the budget receipts totals, rather than as offsetting receipts. In a few other cases, the classification of offsetting collections changed from one category to another over the course of this period. For the sake of consistency, this table includes the trans- actions in the same category for all years. Thus, for example, Panama Canal tolls are included here as reimbursements to ap- propriationsfor all years, whereas the budget treated them as offsetting receipts until 1987.
