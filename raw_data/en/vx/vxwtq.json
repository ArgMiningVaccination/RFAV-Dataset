This investment creates a signi ficant opportunity to alter the region's economic trajectory, validates our strong track record of success and our bold aspirations for an even more prosperous future, and envisions inclusive growth for all of our region's residents. This progress report builds on the foundation of success that the Central New York Regional Economic Development Council has created over the past five years, which laid the groundwork for a successful URI proposal. It brings together the CNYREDC's original three strategic goals: to (1) Strengthen Targeted Industry Concentrations that Leverage Unique Economic Assets ; (2) Improve Competitiveness in and Connections to Regional, National, And Global Economies ; and (3) Revitalize the Region's Urban Cores, Main Streets and Neighborh oods ; the three pillars of economic growth outlined in the URI: (1) Invest in Key Growth Drivers ; (2) Build an Inclusive Economy ; (3) Develop Enablers of Prosperity , as well as the URI's underlying strategies to advance six signature investments that stand to dramatically alter the region's economic trajectory. In furtherance of these goals, strategies and initiatives, this report recommends 37 priority projects to advance the region's growth objectives. These projects represent a total proposed state inve stment of more than $24 million , leveraging $191.5 million in private and other funding for total project expenses of more than $215.7 million , and a five-year total payroll of nearly $59 million . Collectively, they support the creation of 408 new jobs , 1,638 indirect jobs , the retention of 352 existing jobs , and leverage a return on invest of 10.73 to 1. This year's proposed priority projects build on the impact already created in past rounds. Over the past five rounds and URI process, Central New York has been awarded $844 million in state support and investment, more than any other region in the state. The council is proud of its track record of collaborating with local economic development organizations and partnership with the business community to leverage those dollars to implement projects and its strategies for regional growth. Since year one, 72 percent of priority projects are complete or on schedule. That represents 126 projects that have leveraged more than $1.5 billion in private investment. This report also highlights significant progress that has been made on state and regional priorities, and investments in key initiatives: Significant steps taken to establish a hub for unmanned aerial systems firms and innovation; Continued development of Syracuse University's National Veteran's Resource Center; The funding of the Syracuse Promise College Collaborative, a one of a kind partnership with the Say Yes to Education effort; Vast public engagement and discussion around Consensus , the Commission to modernize local government; CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 6 The selection of the city of Oswego as Central New York 's recipient for the Downtown Revitalization Initiative. Central New York is truly a community on the rise. The investment prospectus put forth to the state with CNY Rising is as bold and ambitious as any strategy the region has ever seen. It is one fundamentally rooted in Central New York 's core strengths, and challenges the status quo that has hindered its progress in the past. More importantly, the region's strategies tackle head -on, rather than shy away from, the most pernicious economic challenges it faces - unsustainable levels of urban and rural poverty and a level of economic segregation that threatens the very fabric of our community. As we continue to implement this plan, the grass roots and data -driven process and community -created vision will ensure the region's forward momentum continues. We believe our success is rooted in identifying strong and realistic projects, working with applicants to see their projects through, and offering the state a compelling return on investment in terms of jobs created and capital invested. For this reason, we believe an investment in Central New York is a smart choice. 1.1 RESUMEN EJECUTIVO Cuando el plan del Concilio la Regi\u00f3n Central del New York (CNYREDC, por la revitalizaci\u00f3n de Upstate la Regi\u00f3n Central Conexiones a nivel Regional, Nacional , y la econom\u00eda global ; y de nuestra regi\u00f3n.

CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 8 2 PROGRESS 2.0 STATE OF THE REGION Central New York , as the following charts and data sets illustrate, is seeing progress in key regional indicators. Unemployment continues to decline in parallel to the larger U.S. recovery. Total private sector jobs and wages increased over the past three years largely by the recovery of the region's advanced industries (data to decisions, engineering and other manufacturing sub industries). Yet, overall job growth was sluggish as public employers cut back on person nel. Further challenging the regio n was a decline in overall metro -level exports, yet this may be due more to the value of the dollar and slowdown of the European and Chinese economies than local factors. Finally, poverty, especially among those 18 years old and younger, continues to be a challenge for Central New York and the state as a whole. In its winning URI plan, CNY Rising , Central New York prioritized strategies to drive inclusive and sustainable growth and ensure that the region's success includes all members of its community. Importantly, many of CNY Rising's recommendations and initiatives will address the ongoing challenges and opportunities faced by the region in 2016 and in the years ahead. Targeting investment in value - added agriculture and unmanned systems can continue wage and private sector job growth while strengthening two industries that are key overall exporters for the region. Moreover, initiatives supported by the investments in the Alliance for Economic Inclusion and the National Veteran's Resources Center are specifically designed to combat the persistent joblessness and poverty experienced in Central New York .

Credit: Christopher Molloy Photography CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 25 3 IMPLEMENTATION AGENDA 3.0 IMPLEMENTATION OF 2016 STATE PRIORITIES Each year, the CNYREDC assesses and aligns state prior ities with its three core goals. This year it is also aligning those priorities to the Signature Investments outlined in the CNY Rising plan. The following represent a snapshot of the work Central New York is doing to advance statewide priorities. IMPLEME NT STRATEGIES THROUGH THE PROJECT PIPELINE The CNYREDC constantly and consistently works with potential project applicants to refine project scopes, ensure alignment with its goals, and encourage innovative submissions. The regional Empire State Developmen t office and REDC leadership continue to nurture relationships with key business and government leaders in each of the five counties. Additionally, Central New York 's successful Upstate Revitalization Initiative plan prioritized recruitment of projects in unmanned aerial systems, transportation and logistics, and agribusiness. Throughout the year local economic development officials, in cooperation with Empire State Development, encourage businesses and potential projects to strongly consider how Consolida ted Funding Application (CFA) resources align with their 12-month plans. Additionally, to address the plan's economic inclusion goals, business and community leaders from traditionally underserved areas have been working with their constituents to apply for CFA funding. The council and state agency resource team also promotes underused sources of CFA funding to potential applicants to find opportunities to leverage resources and advance project ideas. This proactive planning, in tandem with day-to-day econo mic development work, is filling Central New York 's project pipeline with projects that propel Central New York 's industry clusters, connect to new markets, and promote smart development strategies. Steri -Pharma, LLC - Line 7 Expansion Project The CNY Regional Economic Development Council has worked with Steri -Pharma, LLC, a manufacturer of antibiotics used internationally to treat complicated bacterial infections, for two years to identi fy expansion opportunities and review the CFA process. While some initial investment opportunities were postponed, ultimately the relationships developed through ongoing and proactive outreach meant that the council was ready to assist and respond when the company was ready to pursue an expansion. SteriPharma has submitted a Round 6 CFA and will invest approximately $42 million to expand operations at its facility in Syracuse, adding a new 18,500 square foot building. The project includes adding a second sterile powder filling line and increasing warehouse capacity through the construction of new clean rooms. This planned growth will allow SteriPharma to triple its existing production output and address future capacity needs, and more than double its curre nt workforce of 48 to over 125 full time employees in the next five years. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 26 TRAIN THE WORKFORCE FOR TODAY AND TOMORROW Work Train, an initiative dedicated to addressing the challenge of un-and-underemployment in Central New York , is creating solutions that benefit both businesses and jobseekers alike. In response to growing industry demand in manufacturing and in furtherance of its efforts to connect individuals to good wages and opportunities for career advancement, Work Train launched the Manufacturing Careers Partnership between SUNY Onondaga Community College (SUNY OCC), SUNY Syracuse Education Opportunity Center (SUNY EOC) , Central New York Technology Development Organization (CNY TDO), Manufacturers Association of Central New York (MACNY), CenterState CEO and On Point for College in April 2015. The partnership, made possible by a $1.2 million grant from the New York State Assembly secured by Assemblyman Al Stirpe, brings together manufacturers as well as economic development, workforce, education and training and community -based partners to analyze industry demand and develop solutions that connect un-and-underemployed residents to jobs. As its first initiative, the Manufacturing Careers Partnership developed and launched an entry -level Machine Operator program in September 2014. The 12-week, competency -based program is being delivered through SUNY OCC and has placed an initial cohort of 12 individuals in manufacturing jobs since its launch. In health care, Work Train continues to work with partners to build their capacity to successfully participate in industry -led workforce development programming. In partnership with health care employers as well as SUNY EOC, On Point for College and the Service Employees International Union 1199 Training and Upgrading Fund, Work Train is developing a health care industry partnership to sustain the Health Train program. In 2015, the delivery of Health Train curriculum was successfully embedded within SUNY EOC, who is in a better position to run the programming at scale and sustain it over time. The Health Train program continues to have success. In 2015, Health Train placed 77 un-and- underemployed workers in health care jobs in Syracuse. The Syracuse City School District (SCSD), MACNY and SUNY OCC continue to partner on the NYS Pathways in Technology Early College High School (NYS P-TECH) grant. The partnership is focused on advanced manufacturing and impacts more than 50 students each year. The grant is valued at $2.4 million over seven years. The partnership among SCSD, SUNY OCC, and MACNY creates a bridge between secondary and postsecondary education and business. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 27 SUNY OCC is in the process of applying for Federal Department of Labor funding, the America's Promise Grant Program, to bolster regional partnerships between employers, economic development, workforce development, community colleges, training programs, and community -based organizations. If awarded, the grant will provide low or no-cost opportunities for underserved populations to meet the anticipated needs of the health care, manufacturing and construction trades industries. If successful, the grant partners will build infrastructure to allow significantly stronger coordination among our publicly -funded, adult -serving, workforce training entities which can allow for easier pathways to college as well as sustainability beyond the four -year grant. Over the past year the Cayuga -Cortland Workforce Investment Board (WIB) has restructured to be more streamlined and proactive in light of the Federal WIOA legislation and to be more regionally aligned. Administratively the WIB is gathering the strategic employment information to inform policy, procedure and legalities to maximize and state and federal workforce funds. The WIB is working to provide business employees and the area's workforce with training and the development of programs by connecting with CUNY and SUNY systems and other training facilities. The WIB continues to match incumbent and new workers with STEM programs and business and tech skills to meet ever increasing industry demands. REGIONAL ECONOMIC CLUSTER PLAN In 2015, the CNYREDC identified Data to Decisions (D2D) as its priority regional economic cluster. As part of this identification, the CNYREDC proposed a deeper focus on four distinct, yet overlapping, industry opportunities: precision medicine, thermal and electronic controls, cybersecurity and information assurance, and unmanned aerial systems (UAS). CNY Rising calls for a proposed major investment in creating a global center for unmanned systems and cross connected platforms in Central New York and the Mohawk Valley, which directly encompasses the UAS and information assurance industries. While the region has strategically targeted investments in a subset of the D2D cluster, progress has also been made in growing the precision medicine and thermal and electronic controls industries. Additional information about the integration of the four D2D industry opportunities into Central New York 's targeted industries is discussed in the next section. Syracuse College Promise In March 2016, New York State announced a $20 million investment to support CNY Rising's Syracuse College Promise Collaborative. The Syracuse College Promise endowment, which is aligned with the Say Yes to Education program, enables CNY Rising's goals of bringing greater economic inclusion and access to jobs to all members of the community through greater access to higher education attainment. The Say Yes to Education endowment is now the first fully funded Say Yes scholarship program in the country. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 28 REGIONAL GLOBAL MARKETING AND EXPORT PLAN Central New York continues to expand the export compet itiveness of companies in the region. As indicated in previous updates to the Global NY plan, through the work of the Central New York International Business Alliance (CNYIBA) Central New York partners with the Mohawk Valley to bring one- on-one export coun seling, networking events, training, and export plan development to an expanded geographic footprint of businesses. The CNYIBA continues to promote global trade opportunities throughout these regions and act as the link between firms who need export assist ance and the wide range of export services available in the community. During the past 12 months, CNYIBA expanded its membership to 52 firms between the two regions. As of June 2016, average attendance at the organization's events was on track to meet or exceed the averages set in 2015. This year the CNYIBA also added a new Export Catalyst program that provides a continuation of intensive one-on-one export assistance to graduates of the successful ExportNY program. Export Catalyst is conducted in partnersh ip with JPMorgan Chase and is currently working with its initial cohort of firms by offering in-house export consultants to help firms launch and implement the export strategies they developed in ExportNY. In addition to continuing to build the global competitiveness of its firms, the Central New York , North Country and Mohawk Valley regions also took steps to enhance the foreign investment that flows into the region. In partnership with the Global Cities Initiative, a joint program of JPMorgan Chase and the Brookings Institution, the broader 12-county CenterState New York region launched the CenterState New York Global Investment Initiative in June. This initiative is designed to assess the region's challenges and opportunities as they relate to retaining and attracting foreign investment. In response to initial findings, the region outlined new strategic interventions it would pursue to strengthen foreign investment opportunities: Focus on Industries of the Future - promote the region as a hub for UAS, data to decisions, engineering, technical services, biotechnology, environmental systems and agribusiness. Leverage Connections - utilize the region's relatively small size and integrated economic development model to build networks that attract and guide FDI, and build stronger relationships with and knowledge of existing firms of all sizes. Engage Rationally - focus on Europe, Canada and business sectors that are a match for this location, URI initiatives and assets. Leverage Merger & Acquisitions (M&A) to Address Capital, Technology and Market Challenges - actively seek to identify and connect legacy industries and struggling, companies to regional M&A U.S. Ambassador to Chile Michael Hammer speaks to Central New York businesses and CNYIBA members about how the Trans -Pacific Partnership will strengthen existing economic linkages, build new supply chains and make it easier for small businesses to do business globally. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 29 service providers and foreign investors. Facilitate a process based on historical outcomes that will prod uce positive results for these companies and the community. Welcome and Support Foreign -owned Businesses - support firms that are established in the region through greenfield and M&A investments to help ensure their growth and expanded foothold in the U.S. market; these firms are susceptible to relocation out of the region if they are not adequately supported. REGIONAL OPPORTUNITY AGENDA Continuing the region's strong commitment to addressing challenges associated with joblessness, persistent unemploy ment, underemployment and concentrated poverty, the CNYREDC called for the creation of the Alliance for Economic Inclusion (AEI) in as one of CNY Rising's Signature Investments. As outlined in CNY Rising , AEI is intended to directly confront some of the most troubling economic statistics facing Central New York : 34 percent of the residents of the City of Syracuse live in poverty; 44 percent of the residents of Central New York are underemployed; The City of Syracuse School District's graduation rate, 55 percent, is well below the state average (78.1 percent); and Syracuse ranks as one of the worst communities in the country for concentrated poverty of African - American (42 percent) and Latinos (57.5 percent). While proposed solutions to these challenges abou nd, partners throughout Central New York recognized in the CNY Rising plan that a major factor contributing to these troubling statistics is the disconnect between people and meaningful employment. As such, the AEI proposes to cultivate a more inclusive regional economy by targeting and funding initiatives through interconnected strategies: Creating career pathways for adults and youth; Growing entrepreneurship and business ownership in underserved communities; Attracting and locating good jobs directly in distressed neighborhoods and communities; and Building tools and incentives for educational attainment. Operation Oswego County - Mitchell St. Expansion Operation Oswego County, Inc. will invest approximately $600,000 to expand and improve a 32,000 squar e foot manufacturing facility in the Lake Ontario Industrial Park in Oswego, Oswego County, to benefit the building tenant, Northland Filter International, a Canadian -owned industrial air filter manufacturer. In keeping with a recent lean manufacturing layout efficiency plan, the project will include addition of approximately 4,000 square feet of new office space, conversion of existing office space back to manufacturing space, and addition of a 1,500 square foot mezzanine outside the building to accommodat e waste compacters. The expansion will retain the company in New York State and allow it to purchase two new production lines, resulting in 30 new manufacturing employees, 25 of whic h were committed in CFA Round 3. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 30 The AEI and its partnership of regional private sector, nonprofit, academic, and public representatives will pursue these strategies by making targeted investments in new and emerging programs and initiatives that align with its goals. The Alliance will also work with each investment recipient to ensure goals are met, performance metrics are tracked and that its investments clearly begin to address the entrenched challenges noted above. The AEI will also act as a forum to analyze and replicate the investments that are showing results across the region and can help troubleshoot programs and initiatives that may not be meeting their original deliverables. REGIONAL HOT SPOTS AND BUSINESS INCUBATORS Central New York 's Innovation Hot Spot continued to deliver benefits to startup companies in 2016, with a focus on initiatives that promote and support the commercialization of academic research and collaboration with entrepreneurs to bring new technologies to market and businesses to fruition. Coordinated by CenterState CEO's The Tech Garden in Syracuse, the Innovation Hot Spot leverages existing resources to maximize the Hot Spot's benefits across Central New York. The Tech Garden enjoys partnerships with StartFast, Syracuse University's Southside Innovation Center, the SUNY Upstate 's CNY Biotech Accelerator, InSourcing incubator, Syracuse University's Blackstone LaunchPad, an emerging incubator located in Cayug a County led by the Cayuga Economic Development Agency, WISE Women's Business Center and a variety of other entrepreneurial associations. Coordination through the Hot Spot enables these incubators to benefit from others experiences, share best practices, and provide unparalleled support to new ventures. Since the awarding of the original Hot Spot application, partners have focused primarily on building out and coordinating the ecosystem of support assets and programs. These initial efforts have resulted in a maturing and increasingly specialized network of support initiatives for startup businesses. No longer does the region just provide basic entrepreneurship support (incubation, co-working space, mentor connection), it now offers specialized programs, infrastructure and growth capital in a variety of the region's industry verticals. The CNY Innovation Hot Spot will act to maintain the sustainability and success of this ecosystem while also conducting additional analysis into the future needs of startup businesses. To that end, the CNY Hot Spot teams are already examining large federal research grants to support the growth of TECS, biotech and UAS innovations and are examining how their programs may be expanded to better support minority, women, immigrant and veteran owed businesses. As the physical hub of the CNY Innovation Hot Spot, The Tech Garden is committed to providing a suite of programs, services and facility resources to support existing and attracting new tenants, both at its physical locations and virtually in neighborhoods and innovation districts around the region. Strengthening this physical anchor of startup development, mentorship connection, and venture capital alignment is a network of Hot Spot partners from across the region that work to align their programs and services with growing regional firms The ongoing development of a tech corridor, or innovation district in downtown Syracuse, supported by the CNY Hot Spot Council, represents an opportunity to align the entrepreneurial support ecosystem with urban revitalization and other economic development activities underway . The corridor includes the five blocks between Harrison and Water Streets along Warren Street in downtown Syracuse, already anchored by The Tech Garden and home to a vibran t collection of resources and companies: The Clean Tech Center, Syracuse CoWorks, Syracuse Media Group, TCGPlayer, Sutherland Global, Virtucom, WIPRO, Tony Baird Electronics, Spin Car and Ephesus Lighting. Renovations are underway at the State CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 31 Tower Buildi ng, current home to TCGPlayer, acting as a bookend to the tech corridor and evidence of investment in the area. Through the NYSERDA Clean Tech Center at The Tech Garden , companies receive support to commercialize clean energy technology. Working with a team of advisors, early -stage companies reach investment -ready status through a customized incubation and acceleration process. The Clean Tech Center provides several resources to clean tech startups, including individualized technical assistance, access to peer relationships to accelerate their growth, and exposure to a network of business leadership, economic development and R&D opportunities across New York State and beyond. The CNY Innovation Hot Spot also maintains a strong partnership with the Syracuse Center of Excellence (SyracuseCoE) . More than five NYSERDA Clean Tech Center companies have won Innovation Fund awards to com mercial their technologies . Additionally, Three NYSERDA Clean Tech Center companies are utilizing the SyracuseCoE's Analysis and Design Center (ADC) to improve the design of their products. Clean Tech Center Progress 2016 (Q1-Q2) To Date (Since 2009) $827,500 private capital raised $23M + private investment leveraged $93,699 public funding raised Nearly $14M in public funding $985,133 new revenue $6.5M + in revenue 3 new products 30+ new products 3 new employees 156.5 clean tech jobs created/retained Further details on the vast array of strong regional programs and services made available to startup companies in the past year can be found under Entrepreneurship in Section 3.1. Looking ahead, a new web -based Resource Pool available through The Tech Garden has been developed, which creates a vehicle for startups to access the professional and business support services providers, including: legal, product development, marketing, sales, supply chain and human resources and aligned by phase: ideation, startup acceleration, incubation, expansion and transition. The Tech Garden will set up a fund to pay providers to negotiate pro bono and reduced rates accessible to Hot Spot clients based on individualized milestones and needs. Upon the completion of each milestone, entrepreneurs will receive credits toward the Resource Pool's professional services. Entrepreneurs' investment of their own time and effort as \"payment\" for these services incentivizing clients' engagement in Hot Spot programming, while at the same time, reducing economic barriers to critical business development resources. Andrey Zykin of LED Spirit, a Clean Tech Center company, demonstrates the company's proprietary lighting and energy solution. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 32 The Resource Pool also plans to increase outreach to veterans and diverse entrepreneurs; increase Pre-Seed workshops and Sandbox programs; implement a new commercialization course; provide startups with access to professional business development services at no monetary cost; improve and increase interactions with Hot Spot clients; improve access to capital; improve the tracking of impact data; and improve regional communicatio n around the sharing of best practices. Hot Spot and Business Incubator Endorsement Given its success to date, the CNYREDC endorses The Tech Garden , in Syracuse, to continue its designation as the region's Innovation Hot Spot . The CNYREDC nominate s the CNY Biotech Accelerator as the region's NYS Incubator due to the core competencies the area has in biotech, the desire to build off these competencies as a part of the CNYREDC's regional plan, and the potential to spin off new business ventures in a field that the region has already demonstrated the capacity to take a leadership role. SUNY COMMUNITY COLLEGE PLANS (NYSUNY 2020) Institutes of higher education continue to be economic drivers across Central New York . NYSUNY 2020 supported several progra ms over the last year. Institute for Environmental Health and Environmental Medicine The Institute for Environmental Health and Environmental Medicine is a collaboration of SUNY Upstate Medical University, SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestr y (SUNY ESF), SUNY Oswego, and SUNY OCC that prepares students to solve real-world health and medical problems through the application of environmental science and technology; the analysis, prevention and mitigation of potential environmental hazards; and the treatment of medical conditions arising from environmental conditions. Key features of this effort include: Expansion of SUNY Upstate Medical University's Center for Global Health & Translational Science . The Center's research includes countries such as Ecuador, Thailand, Kenya and the United States, and it was involved with developing a vaccine for the dengue virus. The establishment of its Global Maternal Child and Pediatric Health Program enabled a clinical trial vaccine study for RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) in Syracuse and Ecuador. NYSUNY 2020 is also supporting a biosafety level -3 insectary at SUNY Upstate 's Institute for Human Performance, to support research and clinical trials associated with mosquito and tick-borne diseases. To develop this facility, Upstate has been in consultation with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, and a high -level research scientist joined the faculty in September 2016. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 33 Development of SUN Y Oswego's $3.1 million Advanced Wireless Systems Research Center , which offers a research training lab and interdisciplinary teaching.

Aquatic Science Center The Aquatic Science Center is a continuing project that will serve as an anchor in the redevelopmen t of the Syracuse Inner Harbor to provide teaching and research opportunities focused, in particular, on the biological and environmental sciences, environmental technology and related engineering disciplines. This project is in the concept design and prog ram planning phase. VETERANS ' PARTICIPATION IN THE WORKF ORCE With more veterans returning from service around the world, providing the supportive services and resources to help them navigate challenges associated with the transition from military to civilian life\u2014such as unemployment, education and training issues \u2014is paramount. More than 900,000 military veterans call New York State home and an overwhelmingly high percentage of those veterans live, work, and attend school in Central New York . In fact, more than 60 percent of the state's military veterans reside in Upstate New York - a percentage that is expected to grow over the next decade, as more than 1.5 million Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines make the transition from military to civilian life. It is clear that as a result of the region's close ties to Ft. Drum, home to approximately 19,000 active duty military members and another 11,000 military spouses and military -connected children, and also to major employers in the defense and technology sectors, Central and Upstate New York will emerge over the next decade as one of the most military and veteran -connected regions in the United States. To support this significant transition, key Upstate New York institutions, led by Syracuse University and its Institute for Veterans and Military Families (IVMF) , are focused on advancing the post -service lives of America's service members, veterans and their families. Syracuse University, in cooperation with other institutions, has spearheaded initiatives that address the full spectrum of veterans' social, economic and wellness needs to provide actionable and national -impacting research, policy analysis and program evaluation; coordinate comprehensive collective impact strategies; and work with communities and nonprofits to enhance service delivery for veterans and their families.

Credit: Syracuse University CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 36 Over the past year, Syracuse University has continued to invest in its commitment to make the Central New York region \"the best place for veterans and their families.\" The University's efforts in this area have been aligned with its ongoing academic and strategic planning , informed by leaders across the campus, and situated within the veteran community in Syracuse and nationally. The University has invested in the resources required to advance the educational experience of veterans and military - connected students , includin g: Creating a veteran recruiting team in the office of admissions, bolstering outreach and enrollment of student veterans and military -connected students. Investing in a dedicated career counseling program , which is addressing the growing career developmen t and employment needs of the veteran and military family community at Syracuse University. Eliminat ing financial barriers to enrollment for GI-Bill eligible veterans, by removing limitations on the University's participation in the Yellow Ribbon program. Eliminat ing administrative barriers to enrollment by streaming processes associated with admissions, transfer credit evaluation and financial aid. As a part of Chancellor Kent Syverud's vision and the leadership of Vice Chancellor for Veteran and Military Affairs, Mike Haynie, Syracuse University's IVMF continues to expand its programs and services. Over the past year, Syracuse University - through the IVMF - has trained more than 32,000 transitioning service members, veterans and their families in small business, technology, project management, and career preparation throughout the U.S., and around the globe. Today, the IVMF is operating programs on every U.S. military installation on the globe, including Fort Drum, supporting the successful transition from military to civilian life for more than 1.2 million U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. These programs and services ranged from employment and career preparation, to entrepreneurship and small business development, to creation of a national hub for veteran business, to deploying a community approach to serving our veterans and their families through a coordinated care network by public, private and independent service providers. Over the past year Syracuse Univers ity's national acclaim as a leader in this space has been recognized and bolstered as a result of campus visits from the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Secretary of the Army, the Administrator of the SBA, the Secretary of Veter ans Affairs, and many other senior leaders from across the veteran - and military connected community. The University has continued to successfully generate external financial support for its work in this area; over the past year, Syracuse University has received more than $25 million in support of its veteran programming from foundations, Credit: Syracuse University CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 37 corporations, government and individual philanthropists.

It carries on Syracuse University's tradition of leading the nation in its dedication to enhancing the quality of post -service life for our nation 's veterans and their families. The NVRC is conceived as a class -leading, nationally -recognized facility and exemplar of campus and community collaboration, serving veterans and their families on the campus of Syracuse Univ ersity, in central and upstate New York, and in communities across the United States. If funding can be arranged, this capstone initiative will be the center of gravity for veteran education, opportunity, and employment. Credit: Syracuse University CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 38 The NVRC will bring together investments being made by national foundations, corporations and governments who are stepping up to the challenges faced by veterans. This one-of-a-kind collaboration will produce cutting edge research, workforce and business development opportunitie s, and advancements in service that will shape national policy and program delivery focused toward the social, economic, and wellness concerns of the nation's veterans and military -connected families. Some of the many ways that the NVRC will support the region include: Consolidating Syracuse University's IVMF technical assistance and community engagement programs, currently operating in seven states, in Central New York , creating 300 new employment opportunities. Robust programming to prepare transitionin g service members, veterans and spouses for in- demand civilian careers in the region, providing career seeking skills and skill translation competencies. Comprehensive programming made available to employers, offering training and support related to vetera n cultural competency, career recruitment, hiring, onboarding, retention and advancement. Entrepreneurship programming focused on training and assisting veteran business owners to succeed as suppliers to local, regional and national vendors. World -class research focused on leading industry practices related to advancing the employment situation of veterans and customized data analysis in support of the veteran employment goals of regional employers. Creating and utilizing close connections with government, nonprofit organizations, philanthropy and private -industry to facilitate ties between business, veteran service organizations as a means to leverage a highly qualified and motivated workforce. The NVRC will house a state -of- the-art student veterans' resource center, designed as a one-stop -shop supporting the educational needs of the region's veterans and families. The NVRC will be designed to include state -of-the-art classroom spaces to accommodate local and national veteran -focused programming, along with a conference center suitable to host community events, lectures, and national conferences and training symposia. Further, the NVRC will be designed to include gallery space in which the region's storied legacy of serving America's veterans can be put on permanent display. This unique space will also serve as a platform to highlight present -day exhibitions of art, culture, and performance relevant to the veterans' community. As a multi -use facility, the NVRC will include office and workspaces, meeting and conference Credit: Syracuse University CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 39 rooms, a cafe, gathering spaces, a 1,000-seat auditorium, and all-support facilities. Designed as a LEED - certified facility and constructed in accordance with Universal Design practices, the NVRC will be a facili ty welcoming and accommodating to veterans and others with disabilities. The economic impact of the NVRC is estimated at more than $290 million over the first five years , which will positively affect not only veterans and military -connected families, but all those that live and work in New York State. The total economic impact is achieved through a combination of direct services rendered, increased opportunity for federal funding, expanded opportunity for private investment, economic impact of construction , conventions, conferences and tourism, commercialization, knowledge transfer and indirect research and human service delivery. The scope and scale of the NVRC continues to become more defined as both partners and funders are identified. Notably, the current concept for the facility continues to evolve and expand to include dedicated space for community -connected service provider partners and discussions are ongoing with those potential partners. In addition, in partnership with the public -sector partners and private -sector funders, incorporated into the NVRC design is a dedicated space and infrastructure to support the expansion of supportive services that the IVMF provides to communities across New York State and the nation (AmericaServes). Importantly, the NVRC is more than just a vision. It represents a tangible commitment to making Central New York the national hub for veteran education, thought leadership and care - making Syracuse University and Central New York the best place in the nation for veter ans and military families. LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENGAGEMENT Municipal officials and planning boards are often the first point of contact for businesses looking to expand. An ongoing effort to provide information and resources to local government officials is a key component of the CNYREDC's outreach. The core of Local Government Engagement is proactively communicating with elected officials and identifying solutions to municipal concerns that are holding back Central New York 's economic development momentum . Clear Path for Veterans Inc. - Supporting the Journey Home Clear Path for Veterans, Inc. will invest approximately $1.8 million to construct new facilities and make improvements to its campus in Sullivan, Madison County. Clear Path is an all-inclusive community - based center that connects service members and their families to resources, while offering engagement, support and a welcoming place to call home. The project includes a redesign of the entry, construction of cabins for overnight accommodations, construction of a maintenance barn, and will include well, water management, kitchen, and septic system improvements. The project will add six new jobs to the existing workforce of 29. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 40 Consensus - Commission on Local Government Modernization In Onondaga County , the work of Consensus, a pilot initiative creating a Commission on Local Government Modernization to engage municipal officials and the community, was named as a Signature Investment of the Central New York's URI proposal, based on the notion that the current system of governance results in highly fragmented service delivery that is both inefficient and less than optimally effective at enabling the community to achieve its goals of economic growth and shared prosperity. In 2015, Consensus released its baseline report, Who Does What & What It Costs , and in January 2016, its Options Report & Preliminary Committee Recommendations . The Commission is currently reviewing public input on the Options Report , and is completing additional analysis and options modeling in a number of service areas, particularly in governance, where members are focusing on models that have the greatest potential to enhance regional responsiveness, representativeness and enhance the voice of traditionally underrepresented constit uencies. The Commission anticipates a fall 2016 release of its final report, which will include a prioritization of recommendations, implementation timeline and framework, and summary of the potential fiscal and operational benefits each would yield. Regar ding prioritization, the Commission intends to identify those recommendations most ripe for immediate implementation (e.g., service -level restructuring or consolidation), as well as those recommendations that will require enabling legislation/additional local engagement/public referendum (e.g., city-county combination). CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 41 In Cayuga County , economic development professionals regularly meet with Cayuga County legislators (Planning & Economic Development Committee) and City of Auburn staff to advise on progress of REDC - funded projects and to provide briefings on upcoming CFA rounds. In addition, the team meets with elected representatives of towns and villages upon request to discuss past or ongoing CFA projects, and potential for project funding in future rounds. The Cortland County Business Development Corporation (CCB DC) meets regularly with the Cortland County Legislature's budget committee to advise on progress of REDC -funded projects and to provide briefings on upcoming CFA rounds. Annually, the staff will advise county and local officials on potential funding sourc es for projects when the ESD resource guide is available. Additionally, the CCBDC includes relevant REDC/CFA information in its newsletter, distributed six times a year to more than 500 county county/town/village/city and other stakeholders and with local media. As part of its ongoing work, CCBDC has direct conversations with the business community to assess year potential projects and eligibility for REDC/CFA funding. In 2016, the Madison County IDA convened the Madison County Economic Summit, consisting of more than 60 local and community leaders and provided a general overview of the CFA and URI processes. Monthly the Madison County Planning Committee receives updates on state initiatives and project progress. The board of supervisors , Madison County's governing body, receive a quarterly update on economic development projects and priorities. In June, Operation Oswego County held its Annual Meeting in the City of Oswego, attended by more than 150 business and governmental leaders, where results of the Round 5 CFA process and URI were presented. Also, information on upcoming workshops and CFA Round 6 were promoted. In July, OOC presented information on CFA Round 6 to the Oswego County Economic Development and Planning Committee meeting that was attended by approximately 20 people. 3.1 IMPLEMENTATION OF KEY REGIONAL PRIORITIES Central New York 's strategic plan is guided by adherence to its original three strategic goals: (1) Strengthen Targeted Industry Concentrations that Leverage Unique Economic Asset s; (2) Improve Competitiveness in and Connections to Regional, National, And Global Economies ; and (3) Revitalize the Region's Urban Cores, Main Streets and Neighborhoods ; and the three pillars of economic growth outlined in in the URI: (1) Invest in Key Growth Drivers ; (2) Build an Inclusive Economy ; (3) Develop Enablers of Prosperity. Strengthen Targeted Industry Concentrations that Leverage Unique Economic Assets Improve Competitiveness in, and Connections to, Regional, National and Global Economies Revitalize our Region's Urban Cores, Main Streets and Neighborhoods CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 42 The URI also outlines seven strategies which further advance these goals, pillars, and the opportunity presented by its Signature Investments: 1. Establish the Region as a Global Center for the Research, Development, and Manufacturing of Precision Sensing Technologies and Data Analytics 2. Strengthen the Region's Agribusiness Sector to Meet the Growing Global Demand for Safe and High - Quality Food and Nutrition 3. Cultivate an Inclusive Regional Economy 4. Make CNY a Magnet for Veterans and Their Families 5. Continue to Grow and Invest in a Globally Competitive Ecosystem for Innovation and Entrepreneurship 6. Develop a Connected and Modern Transportation and Logistics System 7. Build Welcoming and Connected World -Class Communities The overarching mission of these goals and strategies is to harness Central New York 's core strengths, existing and growing global market opportunities, while driving sustained prosperity and inclusive growth for the region's residents. Central New York 's core goals, alongside the six CNY Rising Signature Investments and its strategies, work together to inform the region's broader public policy objectives in tandem with the state' s priorities.

Business and community leaders from traditionally underserved areas have been working with their constituents to apply for CFA funding or to brainstorm solutions to common issues that can be addressed by scaling up and broadening the request. With the aid of the state agency resource team, the council is promoting resources that applicants may be unaware of to advance project ideas and leverage underused sources of CFA funding. KEY REGIONAL & REVITALIZATION PLAN PRIORITIES Strategic Plan Goal 1 CNY Rising Key Pillar of Economic Growth CNY Rising Strategies Strengthen Targeted Industry Concentrations that Leverage Unique Economic Assets Establish the Region as a Global Center for the Research, Development, and Manufacturing of Precision Sensing Tech nologies and Data Analytics Strengthen the Region's Agribusiness Sector to Meet the Growing Global Demand for Safe and High -Quality Food and Nutrition Industry diversity is Central New York 's greatest economic stabilizer, but diversity also presents unique challenges. The region is undertaking strategic actions to invest in regional industry concentrations and businesses, encourage cross -industry collaboration, and attract outside investment and interest. The designation of Data to Decisions (D2D) as a key Central New York industry cluster set the framework to build a global center for unmanned systems and cross -connected platforms as proposed in CNY Rising , and positions the region for boundary -crossing cluster growth, the capitalization on existing expertise, and the creation of innovation opportunities. MANUFACTURING The Thermal and Electronic Controls sector align with D2D's cross cluster potential, build on historic regional strengths, and positions Central New York for future opportunities. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 44 In 2015-2016 a consortium of economic development, private sector and institutional partners continued to advance the local thermal and electronic control cluster through the Advanced Manufacturing Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Challenge (AMJIAC) supported program. The Advanced Manufacturing for Thermal and Environmental Controls (AM -TEC) initiative involved eight partner organizations that conducted coordinated activities focused on: enhancing cluster networks; assisting small and medium -sized enterprises (SMEs) to innovate and grow; reducing risks related to adoption of emerging technologies; retraining displaced workers; and engaging historically disadvantaged individuals and communities. AM-TEC activities supported by U.S. Economic Development Agency and associated matching funds continues through August 2016. To date, 64 firms that employ more than 6,300 workers have been actively engaged in AM-TEC cluster activities. Outcomes and impacts of the AM-TEC initiative to date include: 32 \"TEC Tuesday\" networki ng events (including factory tours, information sessions, innovation showcases, attracting 767 attendees, including 249 unique attendees; 27 disadvantaged firms were identified and engaged in AM-TEC activities; 14 SMEs (including 11 disadvantaged firms) were engaged in mentoring relationships with larger, more mature AM-TEC companies; 25 firms served by activities to increase exports; 12 firms received analysis and design simulation and modeling services provided by Syracuse University engineering students supervised by faculty members; seven engineering students hosted by six firms in an intensive summer internship program including a shared four -day \"boot camp\" in analysis and design techniques; and three new ventures formed. In addition, as of August 2015, outcomes documented via reporting processes that were established for AMJAIC awards and conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) include: 89 jobs created or retained; and $11 million in new or retained sales.

AGRIBUSINESS Agriculture has been a cornerstone of the Central New York economy for more than 200 years. There are more than 3,500 farms operating on 785,000 acres (30 percent of total land) and more than 200 food processing companies employing nearly 4,000 people throughout Central New York . Agribusiness maintains the vitality of the region's rural communities, provides food for our urban cores, and offers tourism opportunities for visitors. Agribusiness and food processing are some of the fastest growing sectors in Central New York , employment rose by 16.5 percent and the number of establishments grew by 31.1 percent from 2003 -2013. Significant investments continue to drive growth as Central New York has experien ced and anticipates more than $600 million in new and expanded agriculture and agribusiness related projects from 2013 -2017. These investments create a stronger agriculture sector and support the growth of the region's export economy. Agriculture is also a signature investment in the Finger Lakes and Southern Tier Regions' winning URI plans. Given the interconnected nature of agriculture in Upstate New York and the tremendous strengths that each region has related to agricultural density, intellectual capital and innovations , the three winning URI regions have formed an interregional collaboration group. The group will focus on catalyzing growth and advancing the goals for each of the regions through coordinated strategies and projects.

CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 47 UNMANNED AERIAL SYSTEMS The Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Working Group's approach to grow this nascent industry in Central New York and the Mohawk Valley includes a five year strategy, named Project UAS Secure Autonomous Flight Environment (U-SAFE), designed to deliver quick, concrete results. The project will: Build the first integrated unmanned aerial system traffic management (UTM) system in the world Construct the only dedicated unmanned system standards testing and certification facility in the world (NUSTAR - National UAS Standardized Testin g and Rating) Establish an innovation district with shovel ready sites and available office and research space for aerospace, UAS, data to decisions and radar systems firms (Drone Zone) Launch the world's largest entrepreneurship accelerator targeting unma nned systems (GENIUS NY) Develop a leading public policy think tank focused on unmanned ground and aerial systems Consolidate new and existing economic development programs targeted on new -to-New York and existing firms operating in this sector Global Center for Unmanned Systems and Cross Connected Platforms The global market opportunity for the unmanned systems industry in burgeoning. Initial economic impac t projections list 3,341 jobs and $3.8 billion in leveraged private investment over the next 15 years as a result of New York's seed investment in this industry. A $5 million investment announced by the State of New York to support the UAS initiatives outlined in CNY Rising will enable the planning and design of next generation UTM infrastructure, national UAS standardized testing and rating facilities, and an innovation district dedicated to unmanned systems, in a corridor between Syracuse and Rome. This investment was announced in August 2016 during a policy workshop hosted by the Office of Science and Technology Policy at the White House on drones and the future of aviation, further validating the region's leading role in the global development of the UAS industry. In June 2016, the UAS Working group initiated the initial design and engineering work for Phase 1 of the NUSTAR and UTM facility build outs. That initial work is scheduled to conclude in mid fall 2016. In response to the strong market demand for drone testing and standards facilities, Syracuse University's School of Engineering is developing interim testing capabilities on its campus. The media company, CNN, has already utilized some of these facilities for drop testing some unmanned aircraft it intends to use. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 48 Six mont hs into implementation of this strategy, the region has already hit a number of its initial milestones. Initiatives advancing the strategy include : GENIUS NY launched, targeted on unmanned systems and other data to decisions firms . The GENIUS NY startup business competition and accelerator is run by CenterState CEO at The Tech Garden. Startup firms compete for awards from $400,000 to $1 million. The first cohort of firms will be selected in fall 2016 for the 2017 accelerator program. Representatives from The Tech Garden promoted the competition at major industry events including AUVSI's Startup Connection, InterDrone Las Vegas and other consumer electronic shows. Thousands of companies have already investigated the program online and hundreds are expected to apply by the October deadline. Intensive business engagement activities . Economic development partners throughout Central New York and the Mohawk Valley are working with dozens of local, domestic and foreign aerospace and UAS companies who have expressed interest in expanding operations in the regions. According to these firms, the regions are a target for their expansions because of the unique commitment made to investing in and developing innovative assets by New York State. Creation of a local UAS Work ing Group .

The project will add 45 new jobs to the existing 14. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 50 TOURISM Regional tourism collaboration took a bold and different step in 2015 -2016. The five CNYRED C counties worked together, without state grant assistance, to conduct the region's first comprehensive visitor profile study. The visitors profiled through the study supported regional claims that the variety of the area's tourism product was indeed the ultimate unique competitive advantage. Shopping, arts and culture, craft foods and beverages, outdoor recreation, downtown activities and entertainment, especially waterfront areas, and events all emerged as key travel activities. Visiting friends and relat ives was identified as a primary motivator, but new travel patterns were clearly acknowledged. More than 50 percent of the travelers to Central New York engaged in both an indoor, more urban centric activity, in addition to some type of outdoor recreationa l experience. Beyond the visitor profile, the study demonstrated key investment needs and market opportunities for destination building over the next several years. The study sharply refuted some long held perceptions regarding target markets, with findin gs indicating that: The New York City metro area represents an enormous opportunity for growth but barriers to travel prevent the market from being as feasible as Boston or Philadelphia. The three hour and less drive market is mature and saturated. Future market growth must come from penetration of further distance points of origin including the opportunity for building fly-drive options. The family market will visit Central New York but should be targeted with less investment than the millennial market. The maturing audience base gives cause for alarm as the region must concentrate on connecting with a younger market mix. The region's tourism economy did take a minor slide in 2015 as the Canadian dollar dropped to a seven year low. The resulting reduction of border crossings created tangible impacts as hotel sales declined and retail sales stagnated. Fortunately, low gas prices and special events hosted in 2015 filled much of the gaps left by the reduction in the Canadian market. By year's end, the tourism industry had its second highest producing year ever as visitors to the region produced $1.24 billion in visitor spending , a modest 0.7 percent decline from the $1.25 billion produced in 2014. The industry employed 26,289 with a payroll of $583 million . The industry continued to drive local and state tax revenue as it provided $89.4 million in local taxes , virtually no change from 2014, and $69 million in state taxes , a 1 percent decrease from 2014 collections. Since 2012, the Central New York tourism economy benefited from numerous openings of new attractions, hotels and events. New openings mostly gave way to tremendous new construction ventures in 2015 as openings were surpassed by major building projects.

Credit: NYS Fair In addition, projects like the Lake Ontario National Marine Sanctuary are making progress to utilize the Great Lakes as an enhanced asset for visitor attraction. As these projects open their doors in 2016 and beyond, they will add considerably to the appeal and draw of the area. Future tourism development needs and opportunities are addressed specifically within the results of the 2015 consumer profile study. The region ranked strong est in the categories of variety of outdoor activities, perceived lodging value and customer service. Redefining the collaboration among the CNYREDC counties has been a priority of the cultural and destination marketing organizations in Cayuga, Cortland, Madison, Oswego and Onondaga counties. The group has worked to assemble a shared approach to overcoming perceived weaknesses in the marketplace while also addressing market growth opportunities. Future funding requests and strategic direction will be confi gured on strengthening the region's tourism industry as a collaborative system. Additionally, future product development will continue to evolve, especially as regional economic development priorities around the Upstate Revitalization Initiative begin to drive various types of travel and demands for various types of new travel products. Priorities identified for improving the destination's tourism growth and the environment for cultural tourism are detailed below. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 52 Actions to Advance Regional Strategies and/or Revitalization Plan: Enhance product training for front line service employees and hospitality management. Focus heavily on the winter season as a critical need period for business. Develop waterfronts and create attractive connectors to link desti nation products. Develop mechanisms and visitor services for engaging with current visitors for longer stays and more frequent repeat business. Continue strategic investments in the visitor experience and in market outreach to regain some of the growth mom entum experienced between 2010 and 2014. Enhance, address or better communicate tourism product weaknesses, such as signage and way finding, children's activities, appeal of shopping and merchandise, variety of arts and culture, and evening activities.

The property is an anchor in the city's business and historic district and will become a driving force for economic development, job creation and long -term sustainability in the downtown area. The project will create 12 new jobs on site. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 62 ACCESS TO ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY As discussed previously, significant portions of the region's population have historically been disconnected from regional economic development strategies and planning. While the Central New York economy is on the rise, the region suffer s from increased rates of poverty. Residents within inner -city neighborhoods, rural communities and, increasingly, inner -ring suburbs struggle to access jobs and build wealth. These dynamics of increased poverty are unsustainable and pose serious long -term threats to communities and the regional economy as a whole, including increased demand for social services, spikes in crime, continued property deterioration and neighborhood blight. A key component of changing the narrative will be to align urban workfo rce training programs with needs of growing industry sectors, and create pathways for adults and youth. As referenced earlier, Work Train is catalyzing cross -sector partnerships to develop workforce solutions that benefit employers and communities alike. These partners, which include businesses and public and nonprofit organizations, work collaboratively to create common workforce solutions, systems and policies. Through the collective expertise of these cross - sector partnerships, Work Train develops train ing and workforce solutions that meet the needs of businesses and increase access to good jobs for un- and underemployed individuals. Work Train's dynamic model enables strategic advocacy and investment in nontraditional solutions that leverage community assets to create lasting impact. Work Train sponsored programs include the SUNY EOC Health Train Program and the SUNY OCC Manufacturing Machine Operator Program. In fall 2016 Work Train plans to launch the International Health Professionals Initiative, accelerating the careers of immigrant and refugee doctors and other health care professionals while helping fill unmet demand for skilled labor in the health care industry. Meanwhile, Work Train is also finalizing a car-buying program with Cooperative Federal Credit Union to help link qualified workers to remote job opportunities in manufacturing. Additionally, the endowment of the Syracuse College Promise program will provide free college tuition to students graduating from the Syracuse City School District, fulfilling a CNY Rising objective to invest in a guaranteed path to college for students in the region's most distressed communities.

Quality, affordable, and centrally located residences are a vital component of broader efforts to align employers, workforce, and infrastructure where there are existing resources. Supporting neighborhood -based businesses is also a critical component to catalyzing distressed commercial districts and properties, creating employment and encouraging entrepreneurship. Up Start , a collaborative effort to empower the next generation of urban entrepreneurs to start businesses and improve their communities, offers introductory classes on business plan creation, business structure and assistance with launch. Up Start helps develop businesses within low-income neighborhoods and underrepresented communities, establishing 13 businesses in its pilot phase.

The exhibition's title and concept were inspired by Barbara Kruger's \"Who Speaks, Who is Silent\" from the Everson's permanent co llection, a monumental work addressing the implication of silence and representation for women. Commemorating the 100th anniversary of the passage of women's suffrage in New York in 1917, \"Seen and Heard\" will explore the state's activist history and its contemporary application. The exhibition will include permanent collection works and newly commissioned work. A summer residen cy program will support three artists working in photography, print making and social practice. As part of an ongoing partnership w ith the Photography and Literacy Project at Syracuse University (SU), the Everson will exhibit the work of more than 25 middle/high school students. The museum will also partner with the Co mmunity Folk Art Center, part of SU's African -American Studies Depa rtment, to host art -making workshops. Through established partnerships with youth empowerment and social service organizations like Peace Inc., the YWCA's Girls Inc., and community centers, the Everson will offer special opportunities for youth to particip ate. Free programming will include a Community Conversation Series, artist talks, and panel discussions with collaborators and community members. P lazapalooza, the Everson's largest summer outdoor event, will take place during the exhibition, offering a da ylong , free open house with art -making workshops, tours and other activities. We will invite Syracuse Cultural Workers, a progressive publisher, to partner with us. 68389 Musical Associates of Central New York Canal Concerts Arts $45,000 $120,000 37.50% In celebration of the Bicentennial of the Erie Canal, Symphoria will present a series of five free \"Canal Concerts\" in parks along the Canal during summer 2017, plus a ticketed performance in September welcoming the World Canals Conference to Syracuse. Performances will feature music connected to the Canal - including folk songs common to CNY during the canal period, music that infiltrated CNY as a result of the canal, and music composed by New Y orkers like George Gershwin that is a quintessentially Americ an blend of both elements. Canal Concert locations will include Rome, and Clinton Square in Syracuse (both full orchestra), plus Camillus Erie Canal Park, Chittenango Landing Canal Boat Museum, and the Erie Canal Heritage Park at Port Byron (featuring la rge ensembles typical of the period). Each park highlights a unique aspect of the Canal: Camillus features a restored and fully functional aqueduct; Chittenango has an excavated and restored 3 -bay dry dock; and Port Byron has a fully intact 19th century lock. Each also offers other amenities, including exhibits, trails, wildlife and hands -on activities. An educational exhibit designed and staffed by the Erie Canal Museum will travel to each concert, providing additional insight. We will also collaborate on a printed piece (a bookmark or rack card) produced as a series, with a variety of site specific illustrations on one side, and different \"fun fa cts\" about the Canal on the other, to encourage the collection of all 6 cards in the series. Together they will provide a complete image or map, and key information about the Canal. The sixth and final concert of the series will be a ticketed performance in Crouse Hinds Theater on the eve of the World Canals Conference, which will draw an estimated 500 visitor s, many from outside the U.S., to Syracuse. This multi -media performance will feature the full orchestra, singers, Canal imagery, and music from the Canal period, narration and storytelling. 65280 CNY Arts, Inc. 2017 Arts & Entertainment Districting Planning Arts $49,500 $49,500 100.00% The creation of Arts and Entertainment Districts piloted in five cities and villages within the Central New York region: Auburn, Cortland, Oneida, Oswego and Syracuse. This is a key strategy for regional economic and cul tural growth, formulated as a result of the in -depth and REDC -funded cultural assessment and planning process ENGAGE CNY. Administered by CNY Arts, ENGAGE CNY assessed how best to reposition arts, culture and heritage as catalysts for improving the region' s vitality. Contributing were a 72 -person Leadership Advisory Council, a 121 -person Regional Planning Summit, feedback from more than 500 artists and 160 arts and culture organizations, and 7000 residents. Revitalization of Main Streets was a top priority. This pilot project was created, in part, to meet this need. Deliverables include: A master blueprint for the creation, organization, and operation of the Arts and Entertainment District s to present to the State for funding consideration. We will formulate an RFP to engage an expert consultant to further analyze the existing regional research and determine what information is required. This will include consultation with public and private institutions of higher education near or in our targeted cit ies, to conduct deep analyses of business metrics to offer alternatives to how arts, culture, and heritage organizations conduct business; and development of district best practices that can be replicated throughout the region. Consultation and coordination with r egional and local government leaders, arts organizations, tourism bureaus, convention and visitors bureaus, and business and educational organizations will take place to determine specific needs for program development, mark eting and capital improvements, as well as project supervision, coordination and staffing requirements. CNY Arts will provide leadership of initiatives, including leveraging corporate and philanthropic investment at the local, state, and national levels to match funds. 65920 Dance Theat er of Syracuse THE DTS Company Planning Project Arts $40,000 $40,000 100.00% The Dance Theater of Syracuse is currently formulating ideas for a full -fledged promotional strategy to effectively market the DTS School and our programs. We seek support from consultants to help us do in -depth research about why people come to DTS, why they stay/why they leave. They will provide a marketing b rief, develop new logos for improve our website and they will develop a Brand Standards Manual for DTS. Within this compr ehensive effort, we will going forward be able to implement and develop new and compelling promotional advertising materials for print ads, radio and social media and the web stationary, business cards etc. DTS will also seek to hire a photographer and vid eographer to take professional pictures and video of students, classes and programs for future use in print ads and on bill boards. Videos to promote our programming most especially the DTS School. We will plan and create video vignettes to post on social media and our website. The video which can serve to document our work in CNY but will also be used to garner performance opportunities as well as br oadcast on social media and public access TV and possibly public television. We are also seeking resources t hrough this grant to plan and develop two signature performance pieces and a lecture demonstration demo to perform in area schools and community centers throughout the county in 2018. These performances will be part of our marketing strategy to area stude nts.We will develop a lecture demo performance project over the summer and fall of 2017. 66524 Syracuse City Ballet, Inc. Workforce Investment Program: Operations Manager Arts $33,750 $11,250 300.00% As Syracuse City Ballet enters its third decade, the o rganization is pursuing a growth strategy to become a robust regional ballet company. At the center is securing space for studios and offices and continuing to enhance staff. The Board of Directors recently voted to engage capital campaign consultants for a feasibility study for a capital campaign to both secure appropriate space and create an endowment fund. An essential part of this next phase of growth is to strengthen and expand administrative and artistic staff to make all core positions full -time. Giv en the funding streams that will need to be developed in order to do this, it is felt that the best place to start is by upgrading the current part -time position of Development/ marketing director to full -time as Operations Manager - not only to work with th e CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 90 Artistic/Executive to provide additional leadership to board and staff on development and marketing, but to support the campa ign consultants, and to provide the full-time, day -to-day coordinating presence to staff and board functions that current staff s tructure struggles to provide. Currently, Syracuse City Ballet is staffed entirely by part -time employees. The Artistic/Executive Director, and director of the company's affiliated dance school, provides a powerful v ision and strong leadership. Over the n ext several years the strategic plan calls for making all core staff full -time. The Operations Manager will be charged with taking the lead in helping the Artistic/Executive Director and the board build the organizational capacity in support of all growth objectives. The expected outcome after Dec. 31, 2017, will be that a capital campaign will be well on its way to providing the resources needed for a new studio and that operation al support will have grown sufficiently to sustain this position as well as s upporting the expansion of other core staff positions. 65741 H Lee White Maritime Museum at Oswego H Lee White Maritime Museum at Oswego Curator Position Arts $29,308 $39,077 75.00% The Museum, located in Oswego Harbor, will expand ou r position of curator to Chief Curator with the purpose to provide enhanced managerial oversight with regards to acquiring an Absolute Charter from the NYS Board of Regents as the only maritime -themed chartered organization on the American shores of Lake Ontario. The Museum acquired a provisional charter in 2015, as a result of a merge with two other local maritime themed organi zations, to provide a unified maritime educational opportunity for the region. The provisional charter provides us with five years to comply with nationally accepted standards for museum operations. To accomplish this, the Museum's Chief Curator will oversee the redevelopment educational initiatives, improvemen t of collections management practices, perform relevant research, and assis t in the restoration management projects the Museum undertakes. Further, the position requires the implementation and expansion of internship programs with SUNY Oswego and Cayuga Community College that bridge the gap between higher education and local cultural resources, and further takes advantage of the professional resources within such institutions. The anticipated outcome, at the expiration of the provisional charter, is the acquisition of an Absolute Charter from NYS. Further, we expect to see an inc rease in the quality of education, exhibitions, and community outreach as we plan to impact regional residents on a wider scale. Additionally, through this expanded position, the Museum can free up previously allocated financial and personnel resources an d use them to further facilitate economic growth and prosperity for our organization. This benefits the local community throu gh enhanced educational opportunity and a better understanding of our local regional heritage, yet also improves and coincides with local Downtown and Waterfront Revitalization initiatives, creating a stronger public -private partnership with local governing structures. 66577 Town of DeWitt Elevating Erie Towpath Road Corridor Design Road Corridor Design will focus on the development of a design for an historical segment of the origi nal Erie Canal corridor. The corridor extends from the current terminus of the Old Erie Canal State Historic Pa rk to Erie Boulevard East and includes an original widewaters area. The widewaters and other canal related lands have been used as part of the larger stormwater management system for the Erie Boulevard East corridor, but are sorely neglected. There are no physical references to the historical nature of the corridor, and there is no connection currently to Erie Boulevard East fro m the corridor. The Town of DeWitt collaborated with the City of Syracuse to develop and launch Elevating Erie, an international id eas competition in the Fall of 2015 with funding through the LWRP to identify potential design ideas for a 4 mile segment that will eventually close gap in the Canalway Trail between the two municipalities. The Town of DeWitt controls a majority of the lan d along Towpath road that is associated with the Canal's history. The intent of this project is to develop a design for the corridor that incorporates a portion of the Canalway Trail; develops a design language for this segment of the gap including histori cal markers, wayfinding, green infrastructure, landscape strategies and street furniture; and explores alternatives for and resolves the connectivity between this corridor, the current terminus of the Canalway Trail, and Erie Boulevard East. The project wi ll continue to engage the DeWitt community, as well as the larger community of Central New York in the development of a vision for the future of this corridor. Subtotal $567,808 $962,696 58.98% CANALS 66760 Canal Society of New York State Erie Can al Bicentennial Exhibition Collaboration Canals $39,000 $78,000 50.00% The Canal Society of New York State (CSNYS) and the Erie Canal Museum (ECM) will collaborate on a statewide outreach for the Erie Canal Bicentennial (2017 - 2025). They will join their uniquely qualified collections, scholarship and educational missions for an exhibition entitled \"Reflections on Erie's Waters - The Erie Canal in New York State's History and Future.\" The exhibit will document how the Erie Canal created the physical and s ocial landscape throughout the State's canal corridor and beyond. The exhibit will explore how that legacy is still alive today . Funds are requested for the design and fabrication in a format that will be available throughout the eight years of the Bicen tennial. Each organization is applying for distinct and necessary elements of the overall program. The CSNYS is including exhibit preparation and its installation. The ECM is separately seeking funds through the NYSCC and NYSCA for its installation, the two traveling version and outreach programming. The CSNYS and the ECM will each present the core elements of the \"Reflections\" exhibit in separate venues, supplemented with artifacts and stories from their respective collections. For the ECM, \"Reflection s\" will be at their historic Syracuse Weighlock Building. The CSNYS will likely offer their version at the soon -to-open Erie Canal Heritage Park on the NYS Thruway. The Park offers an unprecedented and very accessible opportunity to reach large and diver se visitation. As this venue and others will likely have international audiences, solar -powered audio stations and portable multilingual audio units are being incorporated into the program. Additionally, two copies of an easy -transport -install version of \"Reflections on Erie's Waters\" will be available to libraries, historical societies and nontraditional venues. This stand -alone traveling version will also allow each sponsoring group to customize their installations with their own artifacts, stories and public programs. 65959 Madison County Signage Plan for the Old Erie Canal State Historic Park Canals $30,000 $61,500 48.78% The project is to develop and install wayfinding signage within the Old Erie Canal State Historic Park. The Old Erie Canal State Historic Park (OEC SHP) is a beloved cultural and recreational destination within Central New York . The OEC SHP spans three counties (Onondaga, Madison and Oneida) and contains the longest and one of the only remaining portions of the original Erie Canal system begun in 1817. Along this existing original canal within the OEC SHP is 36 miles of the larger 363-mile Erie Canalway Trail. This project fits the focus of this year's funding on bicentennial projects to ensure the Canal's legacy as it will strengt hen the Canal's identity and generate economic benefits for canal communities. In terms of celebrating the bicentennial of the canal, there may be no better section to start with then this section as it was here that the canal first started 200 years ago . Wayfinding signage is needed to enhance access to/from the OEC SHP and enhance trail users enjoyment by allowing them to easily find attractions (such as the Chittenango Landing Canal Boat Museum and Canastota Canal Town Museum) as well as services (rest rooms, laundry mats, restaurants, etc.). Wayfinding signage for the OEC SHP is an economic development opportunity for adjacent communities, CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 91 businesses and sites. Currently there are no signs to identify and direct the thousands of trail users to the many sites, attractions, services, and communities just off the trail. Furthermore, signage is also needed to provide directions to enhance safety and user friendliness. These signs are also an opportunity to celebrate the canal's bicentennial by including interpretative facts on them that can be read by all visitors. The project is a partnership between NYS Parks, Madison County Planning Department, and the Old Erie Canal Community Working Group (OEC CWG) . 68560 Oswego County Oswego River ($103,500 DOS ; $103,500 Canals) $207,000 $283,000 73.14% The County proposes to convert a vacant riverside parcel into a site that provides parking and access to the Oswego River for car top boats, fishing, scenic viewing and other casua l enjoyment. 11,500 sq. ft. of parking will be developed along with approximately 800 linear feet of paved accessible trail down a steep b ank to the river side. The 800 length is based on the desire to keep the grade within accessibility design standards . There is currently no accessible public access to this section (between locks 5 & 6) of the Oswego River. This is a very scenic section of the river and canoeing and kayaking have become very popular sports. This is evidenced by the entry of over 500 b oats in the 2015 Oswego County Paddlefest event. This project will also enhance the safety of this section of the river as it will now be able to be accessed without going through one of the NYS Canal locks. 64061 The Children 's Museum of Oswego Children 's Museum Oswego's (CMOO) is located at 7 W. Bridge St. in Oswego. Plans for the museum include 11 exhibit areas promoting physical and intellectual development. Exhibits will enable children ages 0 -10 to explore themes of regional importance in an educational and developmentally appropriate way. This highly unique informal learning environment allows children and their caregivers to learn about the CN Y region as well as develop fine and gross motor skills, practice social skills and build self -confidence, exercise in a safe environment, and develop early interest in career fields. Exhibit themes include: industry (predominantly power and manufacturing) , agriculture, the Oswego River canal system (including its role in local commerce and mechanics of lock system), local history and role -play of integral careers in our community through a series of mock -town spaces. The museum's master plan also includes programming space and community spaces that can be utilized by other groups and organizations. The interactive nature and educational experiences a fforded by the exhibits and programs at the museum will benefit children across the entire region as the muse um will be designed for the inclusion of children of all abilities and backgrounds. Children interested in STEM will have resources beyond the standard classroom to fuel their passion for innovation and knowledge. This will build ch ildren who are better eq uipped to succeed in their education, future careers, and become positive stewards of their communities. The project will help address the limited opportunities for families in the local community. The goals of the project are to design and install an 8,000 sq. ft. children's museum by funding the renovation of the space, exhibit fabrication and installation. The museum plans to complete schematic designs and start exhibit fabrication in 2017 with completion planned for the summer of 2018. The museum expec ts an annual visitation of 20,000 people. Subtotal $786,000 $2,222,500 35.37% DEC - Department of Environmental Conservation 54305 Cayuga County Soil and Water Conservation District Owasco Lake Watershed Road Drainage Improvement Program DEC $465,270 $581,587 80.00% In recent years, throughout the Finger Lakes Region of New York State, streambank and shoreline erosion has occurred due to heavy precipitation, ice movement and snow melt, and continues to worsen with each weather -related ev ent. Sediment originating from erosion results in a significant decline in water clarity and introduces disastrous levels of nutrients into streams and lakes, facilitating growth of algal blooms, suffocating aquatic pl ants, and creating other water quality issues. As water quality deteriorates, recreational opportunities, real estate values, drinking water quality, aquatic habitat and aesthetics are negatively impacted. When severely eroded areas along Owasco Lake and its tributaries are left unmanaged and neglected, water quality can rapidly decline, potentially impacting the region's fragile economy on a large scale. As a result of progressively worsening erosion, stretches of streambank and shorel ine have experienced loss of protective \"armor,\" including rooted trees and large rocks. This project aims to re-stabilize a combined length of approximately 3000 linear feet of severely eroded Owasco Lake shoreline and streambank segments throughout the watershed in Cayuga, Onondaga and Tompkins counties . The pro ject will utilize a combination of stabilizing techniques including rip -rap, woody vegetation, and advanced manufactured erosion control technologies, such as geo -textiles and geo -grids. Corrective measures will be implemented on both public and private ri ght of ways within the project area with the goal of efficient and effective water quality protection. Necessary permitting and landowner outreach will be conducted to achieve project goals throughout the duration of this effort . 63579 Town of Brookfiel d Salt Storage Facility DEC $456,375 $608,500 75.00% The Town of Brookfield will design, bid and construct an 85'x140' pre -engineered fabric covered salt storage facility with structural steel frames and 12 foot tall concrete walls. The facility will be l ocated at the Town of Brookfield Highway Department, 2186 South Beaver Creek Road. The Town presently stores a 2 year supply of up to 11,000 yards of road salt and sand uncovered on the ground and under a canopy with open sides. A DEC inspection March 9 , 2016, revealed evidence of salt discharge directly into an adjacent wetland and into groundwater. DEC determined that the Town was in violation of ECL 17 -0803. DEC also indicated that the town was highly likely to have exceeded the water quality standard fo r chlorides (250 mg/L) contained in ECL Part 703. As a result, DEC directed the Town to install tarps over the existing salt piles by April 30, 2016. By Dec. 31 , 2016, the Town must implement permanent measures to prevent further discharge of salt to the w aters of the state by either building a salt storage shed or by removing all salt from the site. Failure to take corrective a ction may subject the Town to a fine not to exceed $37,500 per day. On April 27, 2016, the Madison County Health Department provide d a pictometry map to the Town with owner information for properties located near the salt storage area. The County Health Department highly recommended testing the we ll serving 2142 Beaver Creek Road for salt runoff contamination. If tests are positive fo r salt, the County Health Department may also recommend testing of four additional residential properties bordering the salt storage site. The construction of an enclosed salt storage facility is a permanent solution to the direct discharge of salt to the waters of the state. It will also address all concerns registered by DEC and the Madison County Health Department and fully mitigate the transport of salt laden runoff into Beaver Creek, which is located approximately 900 feet east of the project site. 65878 City of Syracuse Engineering Planning Grant Program 2016 DEC $50,000 $60,000 83.33% CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 92 This project is a report which is necessary in order to begin to address sewer problems in Syracuse's Sedgwick and Eastwood n eighborhoods. Currently these neighborhood s experience significant sewer overflow and surcharge issues, however it is not known what causes these issues. This grant will be used to fund an engineering report which evaluates the sewer system, identifies specific problem areas, and makes recommenda tions about how to improve the sewer infrastructure and reduce sewer surcharging during storm events. The project will evaluate the sewers in Sedgwick which has b oundaries of Grant Boulevard in to the north, Teall Avenue to the east, James Street to the we st, and Oak Street to the west. The boundaries of Eastwood are Galster Avenue and Dunlap Avenue to the north, Thompson to the east, 690 to the south, and Teall Avenue to the west. This study will allow the City of Syracuse with support from Onondaga Cou nty to better understand the problems that exist with the sewer system, so that it can identify infrastructure repair projects that will ultimately address sewer overflow, surcharge, and backflow issues that result from major storm events associated with c limate change. This report will identify engineering projects including sewer upgrades, the use of backflow protection valves, and green infrastructure to create a solution matrix. Once the matrix is created the City will together several projects to add ress the sewer issues and improve its infrastructure. 67328 GHD Consulting Services City of Oneida Long Term Improvement Plan DEC $19,900 $24,900 79.92% This project will develop an engineering report identifying long -term solutions to facilitate the exp ansion of production at the HP Hood facility. The report will identify three separate alternatives to accommodate the additional flows and loads that are expected due to expansion of prod uction at the facility. The first alternative will evaluate capacity upgrades at the WWTP in order to handle the increased flows and loads. The second alternative will evaluate reduction of load ing from HP Hood through the use of pretreatment technology. The third alternative is a combination of alternatives 1 and 2, includ ing upgrades and increased capacity at the municipal WWTP and pretreatment of flows and loads from the HP Hood facility itself. The goal of this project is to develop a plan that will successfully allow the HP Hood facility to expand production, as intende d, in a cost effective manner while still maintaining compliance with the City of Oneida's SPDES Permit. Upon completion of the engineering report, an engineering design will be completed and biddable documents will be produced for construction. 67166 City of Cortland Alternative Transportation Initiative DEC, DOS ($500,000 DOS ; $2,000,000 DEC) $2,500,000 $5,400,000 46.30% This project is the nexus of a number of plans and initiatives including: (1) A Climate Action Plan wherein the City is commi tted to de creasing vehicle trips and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. (2) The Tioughnioga River LWRP, which calls for reclaiming the waterfront as an integral r esource in the community and for a waterfront trail. (3) A citywide Pedestrian/ Bicycle Plan that sets f orth plans to support non-motorized forms of transportation that connect activity centers such as businesses, schools, shopping centers, recreational areas, the waterfront and neighborhoods. (4) The \"Northeast Gateway and Clinton Avenue Corridor Enhancemen t Initiative ,\" a 3-phase effort to improve the gateway into the community from Exit 11 of I -81 and the 1 -mile Clinton Avenue /Route 13 Corridor, linking it to downtown and SUNY Cortland via a \"Complete Street .\" Specifically, the \"Cortland Alternative Trans portation Corridor Project\" includes the development of a safe ped/bike arterial corridor along Clinton Avenue from downtown to Exit 11 commercial area, down River Street, and to Yaman Park via an off -road trail and pedestrian bridge over the Tioughnioga R iver. Planned with green infrastructure, this safe multi -modal corridor is critical to providing non-motorized vehicle access across the City. It will connect SUNY Cortland, the downtown, the City's main commercial area/I -81, and Yaman Park, one of Cortlan d's most popular summer recreational facilities that is separated from most of the City by the river and I -81. In addition, it will allow a City neighborhoods to directly connect into this multi - model \"spine\" via secondary roads and existing infrastructure . Specific work includes complete reconstruction of Clinton Avenue , with dual bike lanes and improved pedestrian facilities, bike lane markings on River Street, development of an off -road ped/bike path from River Street to Yaman Park, including a new pede strian bridge on the existing railroad abutments across the River. 66399 Village of Marathon Village of Marathon EPG DEC $24,000 $30,000 80.00% The proposed project will be within Village boundaries and will evaluate several pump stations (within the col lection system) and the WWTP. It is planned that several items will be evaluated and considered such as: emergency generators and automatic transfer switches, addition of mec hanical sludge collection system improvements in the final clarifiers, raw sewage pump replacements, influent channel upgrades, miscellaneous piping, structural improvements, process controls, concrete rehab work for existing pump station(s) and WWTP tankage, and electrical improvements. Additionally, as part of this project, an evalu ation of both influent and effluent water quality parameters for Total Phosphorus (TP) and Total Nitrogen (TN) will be performed. This is a result of recent changes (within the last few years) to the SPDES discharge permit for monitoring these two water qu ality parameters. This requirement stems from the village being identified in the Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) as a non-significant contributor. It is planned that this report will be used to list the project on the New York State Envir onmental Facilities Corporation (NYS EFC) Intended Use Plan (IUP) through the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) for fu nding of the capital improvements. If funding is received, it is expected that the proposed improvements would be designed for con struction. Some of the existing infrastructure has degraded due to age and is at a critical stage of its useful life, requiring a capital improvement project. 66398 Village of Port Byron (V) Port Byron WWTP Improvements DEC $24,000 $30,000 80.00% The Vi llage of Port Byron proposes to perform an engineering study of its wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Specifically, the study would focus on an evaluation of alternative solids dewatering improvements, in addition to assessment of WWTP assets that were n ot part of the 2003 upgrade project. The Village would like to phase out their 40 -year old drying beds and move to on -site mechanical dewatering techniques to reduce the need for liquid hauling of sludge produced at the plant. Results of the study will be summarized in an EFC compliant Preliminary Engineering Report (PER) with the intent to list the recommended project in the 2016 -2017 CWSRF IUP. 67463 Town of Dewitt Repurposing the Bristol Meyers Squibb BMS Industrial Pretreatment Facility to Serve the Th ompson Road Industrial Corridor DEC $96,995 $116,495 83.26% In 1992 BMS constructed an industrial waste water system to pretreat waste water resulting from production of penicillin and other derivatives. Since, BMS has downed their operation and mothball ed 50% of the facility. In addition BMS's wastewater treatment needs have changed now consisting of biological materials, providing additional capacity for conversion. The study has indicated the following: Approximately 3.25 Million Gallons per day (MGD) (50% of design daily average flow) could be diverted from Meadowbrook Limestone wastewater treatment facility (MLWWTF) to BMS treatment facility. Currentl y the MLWWTF facility is projected to spend $17 -37 million just to address current issues. To accommo date growth significant additional expenditures are anticipated. By diverting a significant amount of waste water flow from the MLWWTF to the repurposed BMS WWTF future capital and operational costs of cur rent and future needs may be significantly reduced . In addition to the diverted MLWWTF flow the repurposed BMS WWTF could accept 1 MGD of high strength industrial waste, openi ng the CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 93 Thompson Road Corridor to economic development readily serving manufacturing sectors such as food and beverage industry. Whe n food and beverage facilities want to expand or locate in Onondaga County finding ways to treat the waste has been problematic. Capacity to convey pre -treated wastewaters from the repurposed BMS facility to final treatment and discharge are limited. Thus integration of constructed wetlands as final treatment with discharge to Ley Creek is anticipated. Addition of flows to Ley Creek will enhance the creek's ecosystem. Instruction and enhancement of creek's habita t and re-naturalization of the Ley Creek ripa rian wetlands will improve water retention, mitigate runoff effects, increase flood storage capacity and allow for greater re siliency thus benefiting the Town of DeWitt's drainage management plan and potentially enhancing recreational development. 67108 Madison County Planning Department CSC DEC $15,000 $31,500 47.62% The purpose of this project is to right -size the Madison County government vehicle fleet, which will allow the County to achieve broader goals related to efficiently using funds, reducing go vernment emissions, and achieving Climate Smart Communities Certification status. The project will inventory the full county wide vehicle fleet's characteristics and performance. It will identify and analyze management practices including purchasing, usage , replacement, maintenance and fueling. This comprehensive assessment will be used to formulate recommendations for policies or actions to be immediately implemented by t he county fleet manager. The primary expected outcome is that the Madison County will be able to reduce the cost and carbon footprint of the government fleet, and more efficiently use vehicle and fuel resources. The secondary expected outcome is that the fleet analysis and report will guide long -term replacement policies with an emphasis on high -efficiency, low emissions vehicles to be used and managed efficiently. This is a high priority project in Madison County's work plan for achieving Climate Smart Communities certification status. 67537 City of East Side Wastewater Treatment Plant Dechlorination Improvement project will remove the temporary chlorination / dechlori nation system for Outfall 002 and replace it with a permanent chlorination / dechlori nation system that will enable the East Side Wastewater Treatment Plant meet the fecal coliform and chlorine limits for Outfall 001 and Outfall 002. This project will utilize space that is available in the current structure and is necessary to meet the ne w SPDES Permit Effluent limits and satisfy Consent Decree. 68351 Town of Hastings Town of Hastings Inflow and Infiltration Study DEC $30,000 $37,500 80.00% The Town of Hastings' (Town) Caughdenoy Sewer District (CSD) is located in the southwest corner of the Town, bordered to the south by the Oneida River and to the west by the Town of Schroeppel. The Town's Fort Brewerton Sewer District (FBSD) is located in the south central part of the Town, centered on the NYS Route 11 corridor. Residents in the CSD an d FBSD are served by gravity sanitary sewer systems that are subject to high wet weather flows, causing surcharging in their respective collection systems and central pump stations. The CSD and FBSD contain approximately 50% (249 out of 511 total) of the s anitary users' tributary to the FB WWTP, and are the only gravity collection systems in the Town. The FB WWTP receives an average of 187 gal/day/user, but receives a wet weather maximum monthly average of 333 gal/day/user, representing a nearly 80% increas e in flows on a per user basis. The Town is pursuing grant funding to complete an infiltration and inflow study as a proactive first step in addressing the issue. The applicant will conduct an infiltration and inflow study for the wastewater collection systems serving the CSD and FBSD.

O'Leary Playground, and seasonal farmers market by the Owasco Fire Department. Currently, stu dents who live within 1 mile of the school are not provided bus service; however, the roads around the school are very narrow and lack sufficient sidewalks or walking paths, so parents end up driving their children to school, causing major traffic control issues at the school entrance and unnecessary daily vehicle trips. This project will design and construct sidewalks on the south side of Bristol Ave. , the south side of Adams Ave. , and the east side of Letchworth Street. If awarded, the project will also d esign and construct a walking trail that connects Meadow Lane of the Oakridge Heights subdivision to Shearin Street, which leads to the elementary school. By implementing sidewalks and a walking trail connecting the densely -populated residential area of th e town to the elementary school, Town Hall, playground and market, parents and their children will be able to walk to these destinations safely, reducing vehicle miles traveled, greenhouse gas emissions and congestion, especially by the elementary school. 68208 Town of DeRuyter Sewer Feasibility Study DEC $30,000 $37,500 80.00% In the interest of preserving the long -term water quality of DeRuyter Lake, and with the support of the Town of Fabius, Town of Cazenovia, Tioughnioga Lake Preservation Foundation and Tioughnioga Lake Association, the Town of DeRuyter proposes to investigate the feasibility of public sewers along the lakeshore of DeRuyter Lake. Similar to other lakefronts around New York State, many seasonal camps are now being used as full -time res idences. Most seasonal camp septic systems are never designed for the intensive use of full -time residence and therefore are unable to properly treat sewage; many are simply holding tanks that require replacement with costly engineered raised -bed systems a s dwelling occupancy changes. In addition, a high seasonal water table, impermeable soils, small lot sizes and proximity to DeRuyter Lake result in serious water quality impacts. This project seeks to address the current a nd future water quality concerns b y investigating the feasibility of public sewers in the lakeshore community area. Various alternatives would be provided in a P reliminary Engineering Report for inclusion of the project on the Environmental Facilities Corporation's CWSRF Intended Use Plan. 67929 Madison County Soil and Water Conservation District Carncross Road Fish Passage Improvement Project DEC $90,000 $150,000 60.00% At the intersection of Carncross Road an d South Lebanon Road there is a drastically undersized culvert under Carncross Road. This culvert caries South Lebanon Brook under the road. The stream channel dimensions are approximately 22 feet wide while the culvert is only a 9 foot diamete r culvert. This has resulted in significant changes to the natural stream channel below the culvert. We propose to replace this culvert with a bottomless arch culvert with an approximately 25 foot span. the installation of this culvert will eliminate the serious constriction in the stream channel and allow this trou t stream to correct itself in the years to come and increase the ability of native brook trout to access the stream channel above the culvert more easily. 68577 Village of Sandy Creek Sandy Creek -Municipal Sewer System DEC $24,000 $30,000 80.00% PROJECT NARRATIVE Villages of Sandy Cr eek/Lacona Feasibility Study Proposed Municipal Sewer System Location The Villages of Sandy Creek/Lacona are located in northern Oswego County, New York. Interstate Route 81 splits the villages in a north/south direction. MHI The Median Household Income ( MHI) of the Village of Sandy Creek is $42,917. Need for Project The Village of Sandy Creek has poor soils for on -site septic systems. During significant precipitation events, on -site septic systems fail due to a high groundwater table. Grey water from th e on -site septic system enters the storm drains an ultimately discharges to little Sandy Creek. Little Sandy Creek discharges to Sandy Pond a popular year -round retreat for many tourists. The Village of Lacona has similar issues in many areas of the CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 94 Villa ge. Both Villages have access to Interstate Route 81. A municipal sewage system would allow for economic development within both villages. Vision The Villages of Sandy Creek/Lacona would like to resolve septic system issues within a 5 year planning period and position the villages for economic development. Interstate Route 81 is a main transportation corridor between Syracuse and Watertown. Land is relatively inexpensive in Sandy Creek/Lacona. Sandy Creek/Lacona has an excellent water source and water d istribution system. Impact The project would rectify septic system issues, improve the water quality of Little Sandy Creek and allow for economic development in a wage depressed area. 68273 Town of Dewitt Ley Creek Wastewater Treatment Feasibility Study DEC $239,965 $275,965 86.95% This project will allow Ley Creek to accommodate the Bristol Myers Squibb Wastewater Treatment Facility (BMS WWTF) discharge, as well as build upon and help to expand current restoration efforts in the Ley Creek Watershed ( Onon daga County, NY ), a major tributary to Onondaga Lake, and mitigate the effects of urban runoff and pollution. In -stream structures and substrate will be installed to restore a natural flow pattern, reduce sediment transport and increase habitat diversity. Wetlands will be constructed at select locations in the watershed and riparian restoration will be performed to improve stormwater retention & flood storage, enhance nutrient cycling, minimize stream bank erosion and sedimentation, reconnect habitat, incr ease canopy cover, restore and increase habitat for biota, and improve water quality. Dry dams will be installed at select locations in the South Branch of Ley Creek to temporarily increase flood storage during storm events and, thereby, mitigate and mini mize flooding of downstream residential neighborhoods, industrial zones and business corridors. Restoration will ultimately foster increased connectivity between Onondaga Lake and Ley Creek and provide more desirable habitat for migratory bird and f ish sp ecies identified as important in the Onondaga Lake Habitat Restoration Plan. 66794 Cayuga County Soil and Water Conservation District Critical Area Stabilization --Hydro - seeder DEC $125,075 $169,824 73.65% The Cayuga County Soil and Water Conservation Dis trict is proposing a county wide project in which they will continue to work with municipalities and private landowners to implement BMP's to reduce erosion and stabilize streambanks throughout the county.

Using a new hydroseeder as well as our mulcher, stone riprap, and geotextile fabrics to stabilize these crit ical areas throughout the county will provide better runoff control, and ultimately improve water quality in Owasco, Cayuga, and Skaneateles lakes and their tributaries. 65346 City of Auburn Auburn Wastewater Treatment Infrastructure Project DEC $1,250,0 00 $2,500,000 50.00% The City of Auburn (the \"City\") is applying for NYS DEC WQIP funding to complete this Wastewater Effluent Disinfection Upgrade Project. The City provides wastewater treatment to nearly 40,000 residents in Cayuga County with a capacity of 25.4 million gallon per day (MGD). The project goal is to upgrade the effluent disinfection system and complete general plant improvements to meet treatment discharge requirements. The primary project out come is to improve effluent water quality within the stressed Owasco River (Owasco Outlet, (0706 -0001). (See Engineering Report in Q_5538) The City's Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP), located at 35 Bradley Street has the following constraints: Effluent Disinfection - The existing 1994 ultraviolet (UV ) system cannot achieve its peak daily design maximum of 25.4 MGD. During a wet weather event with flows reaching 19 MGD the UV system becomes unstable. In addition, the UV intensity and disinfection effectiveness are impaired by the regular buildup of al gae in the post aeration tanks. General Infrastructure - In addition to the UV upgrades, the WPCP has two (2) critical plant components that require upgrades to meet disinfection and effluent discharge requirements. These components in clude: 1) Inefficient aeration and post -aeration blowers; and 2) Significant concrete spalling of the Overflow Retention Facility (ORF) ceiling slab. The proposed sc ope of work will address the aforementioned issues: 1) Replace the existing UV system with a state -of-the art te chnology to disinfect the full Plant capacity of 25.4 MGD; 2) Install a steel roof - only pole barn structure over the post -aeration tank and UV system to reduce algae in the system; 3) Install high efficiency blower upgrades; and 4) Demolish the failing con crete ceiling slab for the Overflow Retention Facility. This water quality improvement project is anticipated to be completed within a one and a half -year time frame upon notice of grant award.

At least four motor coach tours with Peterboro as the destination will be executed with the result of 40 persons per coach ($1600 admissions) income. Peterboro wi ll also be a stop on the roundtrip tour between the Niagara area and the Albany conference. 68446 New York State Rhythm and Blues Festival Inc. 25th New York State Blues Festival ESD $30,000 $130,000 23.08% The City of Syracuse is welcoming the New York State Blues Festival back to Clinton Square for a two day weekend of music in July 2017. This free event, featuring local, regional and national performers on a main stage will be followed by artists performing throughout downtown at partici pating nightclubs. Free artist workshops, which have proven to be very successful, will once again take place at Clinton Square to kick off the festival Saturday . This is the largest music festival held in Clinton Square and is also the only FREE blues festival in the Northeast. Downtown Syracuse will once again come aliv e with music for our two day festiva l of blues music, uniting our citizenry under the umbrella of the arts. The New York State Blues Festival is seeking funding to su pport artist fees, expanding marketing plan and building our temporary infrastructure for the festival. The NYS Blues Festival , the only FREE Blues festival in the Northeast, attracts visitors from across the United States and from around the globe. We conducted a survey during our most recent festival where we gathered ZIP codes from a sampling of attendees. We found that 73% were local, 10% were \"day -trippers\" and 17% were from out of the area. We had people from Canada, Florida, California and many surrounding states attend our festival. The board is confident that with support from our community, and an increase in marketing, the festival outreach will grow to be even further. We expect to have even more visitors from out of the area with a strong national headliner (TBD) and with the visitors come m oney: lodging, meals and shopping all benefit.

The formal development of the initiative dates back to 2011 with property acquisition and subsequent program deployment in 2013. The concept's development would not have been possible without the ongoing support of SUNY Cor tland. With CFA funding, we look forward to sustaining the work initiated in the incubator's first three years online. Five year financial commitment wil l allow the project to not only advance but to grow in scope and services through the formalization of local, regional and state partner collaboration. Funding will catalyze the effort by matching resources with need through the public and private partnership that is at the heart of this initiative. As the CBIC Strategic Plan outlines we anticipate growt h both in programming effort and brick and mortar expansion. Having successfully leveraged local resources and federal support to implement programming with state resources to provide the critical basic infrastructure at the site the CBIC is poised to for mally join New York State's networked effort to revitalize industry at both the local and regional level. In addition to enhancement of programming physical growth will occur through the completion of renovation at the site as well as potential expansion t o an adjacent building utilizing additional elevator stops that were built into the largest phase of construction to date. These issues/opportunities will lead to increased clients and interactions as well as increased physical space. Those deliverables will be tracked and included in annual reports. Further details on the approach are outlined in the Strategic Plan and will be answered in greater detail later in t his application process. 68610 County of Onondaga Oncenter Convention Center Enhancements ESD $975,000 $2,500,000 39.00% Upgrades and Enhancements to Center (at Oncenter).

Since the City has sponsored previous microen terprise assistance programs (MAP -1), the benefits to be gained by participants and the community are clear. The result of MAP -1 & 2 was 12 businesses were assisted, 21 FTE jobs were created and over $75,000 was leveraged. The City has received pre -applica tions from 15 businesses requesting $356,000 in grant funds. Those businesses are proposing to create 30.5 FTE jobs. A budget of $225,000, includes $165,000 for direct business grants; $3,000 for training, $22,000 for program delivery, and $10,000 for admi nistration. The City estimates that it will assist six (6) microenterprises, which will create 13 FTE jobs. 66502 Cayuga Economic Development Agency Nolan Block Redevelopment HCR $500,000 $1,110,000 45.05% The Nolan Block Redevelopment project is a mixed use rehabilitation of 20,000 square feet of historic downtown Auburn, New York property located at 41, 43 -51, 53 Genesee Street, Auburn. Previous to current ownership by Nolan Block LLC, the building was condemned for code violations. Upgraded storefront space will create space for new businesses to be created, and for existing businesses to expand. Currently the occupancy rate of downtown storefronts is 90% as reported by the BID which has prevented many businesses from opening in downtown Auburn. The pr oject plans to create five small storefronts ranging between 1,700 - 2,000 square feet which will provide storefront retail small business development which will help move visitors and residents from their cars and on to sidewalks. The second and third st ories of the building will be converted to 1 -bedroom and 2 -bedroom apartments equipped with an elevator. Currently there are no completed BID district apartments equipped with an elevator which limits the ability to lease the apartments to families and the aging. The combination of downtown CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 99 amenities within walking distance and the elevator will help diversify the population who can live in the upper level apartme nts. With apartment occupancy rates at 95.5% , the city of Auburn is in dire need of additional rental units for all generations and economic levels. The Nolan Block Redevelopment project is one part of a greater redevelopment effort which purchased a vacant adjacent bank building which is being converted into a museum of play which will be free to the public and a co -working office space. The adjacent property is not a part of the grant application but will play an important role in retaini ng tenants with families who could utilize the play museum or professionals who are looking to live next to the ir co -working office spaces. The buildings will be connected through a rooftop deck allowing them to access their offices directly from their apartments. 66543 Madison County Madison County Microenterprise Assistance Program HCR $200,000 $220,000 90.91% The Madison County Microenterprise Assistance Program (MAP) will offer entrepreneurial training, business plan development, c apital grants and follow -up technical assistance to prospective and existing microenterprises in the southern portion of Madison C ounty. The MAP will focus on the towns of Brookfield, DeRuyter, Eaton, Georgetown, Hamilton, Madison, Nelson, and Lebanon which include the villages of DeRuyter, Earlville, Hamilt on, Madison and Morrisville. These communities are more rural than those in the northern portion of the County and offer unique opportunities for microenterprise startups and expansions in agri - busines s, craft work, tourism and agri tourism, and more traditional retail and service businesses. Substantial interest in the MAP has be en identified by the Partnership for Community Development (PCD), a Hamilton -based not -for-profit corporation that has initiated several innovative community and economic development programs over the past few years. The PCD, which will implement the MAP a s a sub grantee to Madison County, has substantial experience in managing and administering programs and projects and is currently administering an OCR planning grant for the Hamilton Air Pa rk and an OCR economic development grant for the Good Nature Brewi ng expansion. The PCD has assembled a strong entrepreneurial assistance package that includes classroom instruction and business planning provided by the Mohawk Valley Small Business Development Center (SBDC) and one -on-one technical assistance to be prov ided by Colgate University's Thought Into Action and Cornell Cooperative Extension. All of the training and technical assistance services will be provided to the MAP without charge and the OCR funding will be used exclusively to provide grants to start -up and existing microenterprises and to pay associated program delivery and administration costs. An estimated 8 microenterprises will be assisted with OCR grant funds. 63366 Village of DeRuyter DeRuyter CDBG Water Improvement HCR $489,900 $489,900 100.00% The Village of DeRuyter will replace 244 obsolete and inaccurate water meters with radio read meters and related software. Th e project will replace the existing 20 year old meters with meters that can be read by radio and remotely disconnected which will enable the Village to perform quarterly meter readings instead of semiannual . The project advantages are manifold. Accurate meter reading will reduce the current water losses within the water system (estimated at 15% ), foster water conservation, and red uce the wear and tear on other water infrastructure. Residents will now be able to more closely monitor water usage which can reduce instances of unanticipated high bills due to unknown leakages. This is especially important in this 60% Low -moderate inc ome community where the financial impact of a single leaking toilet can be $110 or more per year. 66681 City of Cortland Clinton Avenue Infrastructure Project HCR $750,000 $2,017,935 37.17% The waterline along Clinton Avenue between Pomeroy Street and No rth Main Street is approximately 100 years old and in poor condition . This project will replace the aging water main along the Clinton Avenue corridor in the City of Cortland, immediately adjacent to downtown. The existin g main is approximately 4,291 feet long with 1,283 feet of residential service lines and 478 feet of business lines. The existing mains are cast iron and range in size from six to 8 inches in diameter. There are also 10 fire hydrants located along Clinton Avenue that were replaced in 2004 and are in good condition. The preliminary engineering report identifies that due to the age of the Clinton Avenue water mains, they are susceptible to damage in the very near future as a result of hydrologic transients (water hammer), temperature variatio ns (especially frost heaving), and internal and external corrosion. Based on the condition of the distribution piping, valves , associated equipment, and annual number of pipe repairs, the preliminary engineering report recommends that this project replace the entire water distribution system along Clinton Avenue. Water mains will be replaced with 8\" Class 52 ductile iron pipe with side street connections being replaced w ith 6\" Class 52 ductile iron pipe. The Class 52 piping will have a working pressure of 2 00 psi to minimize potential failure from water hammer and surging. Lines to hydrants will be constructed of cement lined ductile iron pipe of 6\" diameter. Service laterals from the main to residential curb stops will be \u00be\" Type K Cop per and businesses wil l be 1\" Type K Copper lines. Ductile iron piping was selected for this project because the City has the required tools to maintain this type of pipe. 66903 Village of Phoenix Infrastructure Upgrade Project HCR $529,216 $679,216 77.92% The Village of Phoe nix is seeking grant funds for the Infrastructure Upgrade Project (the Project) which will address repairs and upgrades to th e sanitary sewer, water and storm sewer systems. The proposed water system improvements in the Project are based on the Water Syste m Hydraulic Analysis prepared by Miller Engineers dated April 5, 2016. The report identifies deficiencies in the system's ability to provide adequate fire flow prote ction and pressure in certain areas due to the physical constraints of the existing system. To alleviate all the deficiencies, a series of improvements were identified. Increasing the existing 8\" water main along Lock Street to a 12\" water main will serve as the backbone to all of the future improvements to the water distribution system. The Pro ject will improve pressure and fire flow capabilities in accordance with the Insurance Services Office. The sanitary sewer and storm sewer components proposed in the Project are based on the Sewer System Hydraulic Analysis prepared by Miller Engineers date d Feb. 12 , 2016. The report concluded that segments of the sanitary sewer system have significant inflow & infiltration problems (I&I) as well as frequent sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs). The analysis has t argeted the core of the Village as possible source s of inflow that could be cost -effectively removed by the construction of storm sewers. Constructing an 18\" storm sewer along Lock Street will decrease inflow to the sanitary sewer system, especially during storm events, which would decrease the likeliness of a SSO event. New storm sewers were recently installed along Lock Street flowing northeast from Jefferson Street as well as on Cherry Street flowing northwest. The proposed 850 fee t of storm sewer will be another element in the implementation of a more robust storm sewer network to allow for a greater portion of the Village's stormwater to be diverted. 68052 City of HCR $500,000 $1,596,600 31.32% The proposed Cahill Landing project will restore the oldest surviving commercial buil ding in Oswego County. The structure had fallen into extreme disrepair and was vacant for several years; however, the City of Oswego awarded preferred developer status to a local developer who took on the enormous risk of stabilizing the building from col lapse to preserve the historic structure. The proposed project will be completed in two phases with the first phase focusing on the stabilization, restoration and development of the existing structure and that is the focus of this funding application. Phase 2 is the development of newly constructed townhouses. Phase 1 will further stabilize the building and redevelop the vacant space into a multi -use facility with residential apartments and turn - key restaurant space. The existing building is located alo ng the Oswego River and in the downtown area as well as along the waterfront corridor. It is located along the Oswego Riverwalk West trail and is a very short distance to the Veteran's Stage which hosts the Oswego Summer Concert Series. The complete rest oration of the building will fill in the gaps to bring vibrancy and traffic to this area of Downtown Oswego. This project should be seen as a regional priority as it fits into the CNYREDC Economic Development Strategic Plan's goal to support investments in urban cores, main streets and neighborhoods. The business proposal to incorporate residential apartments and a turn -restaurant space has been identified as a critical need in Downtown Oswego. The proposed project will be self - sustaining after the NYMS f unding as the proposed funding is designed to stabilize and restore the anchor building. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 100 66450 Downtown Committee of Syracuse Inc. Hanover Square -Erie Boulevard Main Street Target Area HCR $500,000 $35,985,627 1.39% The Downtown Committee of Syracuse i s applying for a $500,000 New York Main Street (NYMS) Grant to encourage building renovation projects in Downtown Syracuse. The program is called the Hanover Square -Erie Boulevard Main Street project and includes the 100, 200 and 300 blocks of East Water S treet, the 100, 200 and 300 blocks of Erie Boulevard East, the 100 and 200 blocks of East Genesee Street, the 100 block of South Salina Street, a nd the 100 block of South Warren Street. Traditional NYMS Target Area Building Renovation funds will encourage affordable residential development on the upper floors of buildings, support the development of vacant and underutilized storefronts, fund facade improvements, and create inviting streetscapes within the ta rget area. The Downtown Committee envisions awardi ng three to four residential grants, two to three retail space and/or fa\u00e7ade improvement grants, and one streetscape improvem ent grant. NYMS funds will address the need for more residential units - including greater affordability -- and the need for invest ment in and rehabilitation of downtown properties. Several properties in the target area are vacant or underused; however, with a growing trend toward new downtown housing and commercial space, as noted in the Strategic Plan, these properties present oppor tunities for increased economic activity in the downtown core. These funds will create several layers of economic activity. By facilitating construction of upper -floor apartments, NYMS grant funds increase the demand for services in the urban core. By acti vating vacant retail storefronts, improving building facades and creating complete streetscapes, the grant funds will help to encourage pedestrian activity on the street level and create a safe and inviting path for shoppers and residents alike. Overall, t his program will help to drive economic growth and create a vibrant district inviting more residents, workers, and businesses to the heart of Downtown Syracuse. Subtotal $4,034,116 $43,772,028 9.22% PARKS 63156 Seward Woodshed Revitalization Parks $133,030 $133,030 100.00% For nearly 170 years, the rear woodshed section of the Seward House has been left underutilized, resulting in an immediate ne ed for restoration. Currently, several structural elements of the wood shed have fallen into a severe state of disrepair, and the structure has become a significant hazard that cannot be ignored a ny longer. Through intense restoration work, the structure's foundation, interior and exterior walls and studs, floor joists, ra fters, and roof will be effectively restored. This work will return the woodshed structure to its original state: a functional extension of the main house that reflects a uniquely Seward design inspired from popular 19th century Italianate and Federal styles of architecture. Further work involving the installation of mechanical systems will ensure sustainable preservation of the woodshed as it is adapted into a multi -purpose visitor space in the years immediately following its restoration. A plan for the wood shed's restoration was recently completed by the Seward House Museum in the form of a comprehensive $30,000 project prospectus. This plan strictly regulates matters such as contracts, fiscal administration, change orders, project sequence and procedures, a nd adheres to all relevant codes and permits. By adopting these standards, the restoration of the woodshed will be completed exactly as designed, and within the budget that has been determi ned from analyzing the scope of work as prepared by Crawford and St earns Architects and Preservation Planners of Syracuse , New York. No other preservation project for the Seward House Museum is more imperative and shovel -ready as this project. 64471 Town of Richland Haldane Center Improvement Project Parks $280,061 $373, 415 75.00% The Town of Richland is seeking grant funding from the NYS Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation for the Hald ane Center Improvement Project, which will increase use of the facility located on Maple Avenue Extension in the Villag e of Pulaski; attract new users; improve access to recreational opportunities for those with limited abilities; expand educational opportunities for children and adults; decrease energy consumption; redu ce operation and maintenance costs; and support the l ocal economy.

It will provide the park's 1 million annual visitors, schoolchildren, community partners and research/acad emic communities from throughout the region with a dedicated venue for robust new interpretive programmatic offerings as well as observational tools to enhance enjoyment and learning at the Central NY Park Region's premier park. Located a mere 5 miles east of Syracuse, Green Lakes is simultaneously a leading regional recreational resource and a nationally recognized natural treasure due to its two glacial lakes, Green Lake and Round Lake \u2014two of only 11 glacial plunge -basin meromictic lakes in the U.S. Nestl ed up against growing residential communities, the 1,955 -acre park provides exceptional opportunities for residents of NY's sixth largest metropolitan area to connect with nature. The Environmental Education Center will enable the park to provide new forma l class programs to the region's schoolchildren, which will support state and national curricular standards; afford expanded research and volunteer opportunities to local and visiting college students and professors; house work that advances stewardship of the lakes; and further promote the park as an ecotourism attraction. Permanent exhibits and educational programs will enrich visitor appreci ation of this unique natural setting. Adaptive reuse of the boathouse will protect and enhance the current use of b uilding for watercraft rentals while maximizing its historic interior spaces as an essential three -season, ADA -compliant educational facility. The project recognizes and cares for an integral historic and cultural resource within the pa rk while expanding i ts educational impact. The Environmental Education Center will support the region's tourism economy by promoting longer and r epeat visits and enticing visitors to the park in typically quieter seasons. 66299 Thoma Development Consultants City of Cortland Pool House Parks $407,586 $543,448 75.00% The Wickwire Pool House renovation project will stabilize, rehabilitate, and update the 36'x81' Pool House adjacent to the Wi ckwire Pool, located at Suggett Park within the City of Cortland. In light of recent re novations to the Wickwire Pool in 2015 -2016, there has been significant interest in the renovation of the associated Pool House. The Pool House was originally constructed in 1946, and while it has been maintained, and some upgrades were added in the 1980s, it is due for a full renovation project. The most important element to be added, is an ADA ramp into the building, as well as ADA compliant shower s. Other elements that are in need of renovation include new shower and bathroom fixtures, all of which will have water efficient, environmentally friendly components. The plumbing and electrical fixtures will be replaced, allowing for safe usage of the facilities. In addition, lighting will be replaced throughout the b uilding to allow energy efficient, code appr oved lighting into all areas of the Pool House. The decaying tile floors will be replaced, as well as cracks in the walls of the building, ensuring that the structure is sound and safe for all users of the pool facility. 65088 Stone Quarry Hill Art Park 2016 Application Parks $117,870 $234,940 50.17% The Art Park is seeking Historic Preservation funding to stabilize and restore the Dorothy Riester House & Studio. Restoratio n projects have been identified in accordance with recommendations of a 2016 Facili ties Condition Assessment performed by the architectural firm Ashely McGraw. This project will also include CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 101 funding for architectural drawings for any needed modifications for the House & Studio ( e.g., ADA compliance, parking, restrooms) that result from a n organization -led Master Planning process currently underway. The House & Studio was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. As the former private residence of Art Park founders Dorothy and Robert Riester, this historic property was gi fted to Stone Quarry Hill Art Park in 1998. In the transition from founder's house and studio to historic property, only minor routine maintenance has been done and no major upgrades have been done in over 50 years. With the intent to transition from a pri vate residence to a public space, there is a need to maintain the historic integrity of the facilities while making them safe and accessible to the public. Stabilization and restoration will include roofing repair, window trim preservation, reconstruction of a back porch, furnace upgrades, insulation, restoration of the entranceway, gutter repair, sealing a damp basement, and soffit restoration. The Art Park is c urrently developing a Master Plan that will address the future use of the House & Studio. Archit ectural drawings to integrate such uses, while maintaining the historic integrity of the facilities, would occur in parallel with the stabilization and restoration projects. Following the completion of this project, the Art Park ant icipates greater public access with increased opportunities to educate the public about the historic and architectural significance of the House & Studio, Doroth y Riester and her artistic influences. Public lectures, tours and other programs are anticipated. 67540 WM Engineering DPC Nine Mile Creek Walk Parks $7,500 $10,000 75.00% This application seeks funding for a stand -alone planning project to develop a Nine Mile Creek Walk at the new Camillus Mills development at 54 Main Street in the Village of Camillus. The development i s a repurposing of the historic Camillus Cutlery, a knife fabrication manufacturing facility which closed in 2007, and is expected to increase economic opportunity in the Village. The Village is proposing a 750 foot walk along the Nine Mile Creek bank that borders the east side of the Camillus Mills property. Equally important, the Village is proposing to use this opportunity to extend the connectivity of Ni ne Mile Creek's natural, historic and heritage assets from Martisco Station to the Nine Mile Creek Aq ueduct. At the southern end of the proposed creek walk is the Martisco Museum, a restored former New York Central Railroad station listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was active from 1834 until 1959. The Central New York Chapter of the National Railway Historical Society purchased the property in 1966. The Nine Mile Creek Feeder Canal runs northward from an or iginal feeder dam across Nine Mile Creek south of the Village of Camillus to the Erie Canalway at Newport Road. The feeder canal, i n use from 1845 to 1917, supplied water to the Erie Canal. At the center is the Village of Camillus and the redeveloped Camillus Cutlery. At the northern end of the proposed creek walk is the Town of Camillus Erie Canal Park which is part of the Erie Canal way National Heritage Corridor and home to the restored 1844 Nine Mile Creek Aqueduct which is on the National Registry of Hi storic Sites . The entire route would connect Martisco Station, the Feeder Canal, Village of Camillus, Camillus Mills, Munro Park, E rie Canal Park and the Aqueduct allowing pedestrians, bicyclists, cross -country skiers and snowshoers to travel 30 miles from Martisco to Reed Webster Park located on Warners Road next to the Erie Canal in the Town of Camillus. 67889 CNY Regional Planning and Development Board Selkirk Point Pocket Park Pre - Development and Design Parks $100,000 $200,000 50.00% The project will encompass predevelopment coordination, planning and design to facilitate historically -sensitive, redevelopment of Selkirk Point on Lake Ontario to include a waterfront pedestrian boardwalk in place of the existing County roadway adjacent to Historic Selkirk Lighthouse, a National Register historic site and within a New York Natural Heritage Program Area.

In an effort to ensure that as many stakeholder groups as possible were engaged , the Public Participation Work Group (PPWG) analyzed the demographic of parti cipants in public events over the past five years. During this review it was noted that a very small sample size of Millennials were participating in the public forums and events. To address this issue a presentation and brainstorming session with young professionals and entrepreneurs was scheduled at the Syracuse Co-works Space (a past REDC funded priority project). The event successfully engaged 35 individuals with a mean age of 32, and garnered significant input that the REDC will use to continue to shap e its strategies and priorities. In addition , there were some specific methods and channels recommended that the PPWG can use to better engage Millennials and harness their ideas and energy to promote the region moving forward. The leadership of the REDC and the PPWG conducted a robust URI presentation tour throughout Central New York to highlight the six strategic investments and the anticipated return on investment for the $500 million URI award over the next five years. Most of these presentations invo lved question and answer sessions and an opportunity for participants to better understand how projects could be considered for URI funding , and how they can remain informed on the progress of URI implementation.

The Cayuga Economic Development Agency (CEDA) contributes articles to the Auburn Citizen on a monthly basis to provide the general public economic development news and progress and collaborates on the content of an annual progress report that has focused heavily on the REDC process and projects over the past five years Operation Oswego County (OOC) publishes an electronic newsletter called the E-News. The E-News has won awards from the New York State Economic Development Council and Northeastern Economic Developers Association. Its circulation is approximately 550 businesses, organizations and leadership individuals and elected officials at the national, state and local levels. OOC also operates Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter accounts to share information on economic development activities, including the URI and CFA process and outcomes. Since December 2015, the E-News has provided regular updates of the CFA, URI and Downtown Revitalization Initiative (DRI) programs. In June, an article prepared by Operation Oswego County appeared in Oswego County Business Magazine promoting the upcoming Round 6 CFA process to promote and encourage applications. The OCBM has more than 5,500 subscribers in the Central New York Region. Integral to the efforts to keep the public and other stakeholders informed about the CNY Rising signature investment to advance the work of the Commission on Local Government Modernization, Consensus conducted 79 community meetings across Onondaga County following the release of its Options Report and Preliminary Committee Recommendations at the end of January 2016. Those meetings directly engaged nearly 4,000 people, and provided an opportunity to hear and respond to hundreds of questions, comments and suggestion s. In addition, the Consensus website, www.consensuscomment.com , Syracuse.com and social media has collected more than 11,000 comments on the Commission's work . As a capstone to this process, Consensus com missioned a community survey by the Siena Research Institute . This survey found that the community is highly engaged on this issue with more than a third of registered voters expressing familiarity with the work that Consensus is doing (considered very high for this type of policy issue). By a margin of 48 percent to 45 percent, the community says it wants to see modernization. When asked on a service -by-service level, every service area has majo rity support for modernization. On the specific proposal to create a new city-county metro government, 56 percent say they are interested in CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 106 more information, 20 percent express support, 23 percent say they want to keep things the way they are. These survey results are seen as a strong showing of interest in this matter across the community.

Oswego's downtown is characterized by a tight, small -city, urban grid with the Oswego River running North -South through the heart of downtown, providing riverfro nt views and recreation within a quarter mile of all points. New York State Route 104 runs East -West through downtown and is the city's major arterial and Main Street. To the North, downtown is bounded by the rich commercial, cultural, and recreational resources of Wright's Landing Marina, the H. Lee White Maritime Museum, the Port of Oswego, and Fort Ontario. The southern boundary of downtown is at Utica Street, a secondary thoroughfare for residents that crosses the Oswego River. On each side of the river at Utica Street are significant gateways into the City from the South and the CNY Region via State Route 48 on the West and State Route 481 on the East. The western boundary runs parallel to West 5th Street, which is a North -South thoroughfare that connects west side neighborhoods to State Route 104, Lake Ontario, Wright's Landing and Breitbeck Park . The Oswego Health Hospital is located at the western edge of the boundary between West 5th and West 7th Streets on NYS Route 104. Also Franklin Square Park is within downtown and Franklin Square, Montcalm Park and Kingsford Historic Districts are at the edges of the western boundary, providing historic architecture and charming near -downtown neighborhoods. The eastern boundary is at East 4th Street which is a North -South thoroughfare that connects east side neighborhoods to State Route 104 and Fort Ontario. Washington Square Park is at the southeast corner of the boundary within downtown and the Washington Square Historic District is located just south of the park, which is home to 39 historic structures, including the Richardson -Bates House Museum . Rationale for Selection The DRI plan submitted aligns with CNY Rising and the CNYREDC's strategic plan. It demonstrates a community with both a need for a new opportunity, and a readiness to capitalize and leverage these investments to provide an optimal return to Central New York and its residents . Oswego's plan shows that this onetime investment has the potential to produce considerable long -term growth and prosperity in the region. Oswego boasts many assets that include a scenic CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 108 waterfront location, a compact and walkable downtown, a rich cultural history and several anchor institutions such as SUNY Oswego , Oswego Health and the Port of Oswego Authority . Due to these assets in addition to Oswego's community coming together to submit a well thought out strategic plan, Oswego is well-positioned for a transformation while maintaining its small town charm. Summary of Assets that Make the Selected Downtown Uniqu e There are very few communities that can showcase the natural and built assets possessed by the city of Oswego, including the scenic beauty of picturesque Lake Ontario with astonishing sunsets, significant historic, heritage, and cultural sites and activi ties, recreational activities for the outdoor enthusiast in the summer and winter months, and the small town locale of Oswego's waterfront and downtown. Oswego's strengths include its waterfront, a historic downtown that is compact and walkable, neighborho ods rich with varying architectural designs and amenities, propelled by a community -based neighborhood revitalization effort, as well as being home to major employers and anchor institutions such as SUNY Oswego, Novelis Corp., Oswego Health, the Port of Oswego Authority, Exelon and Entergy, Oswego County Opportunities, St. Luke's Health Services, and a host of small businesses including hotels, inns, shops and restaurants. From left: Novelis Corp. (credit: CenterState CEO), Port Oswego), SUNY Oswego (credit Oswego County Tourism). Downtown Oswego has a wide range of parks and cultural assets that provide for an enhanced quality of life. Bretibeck Park, Wright's Landing Marina, Veterans Memorial Park, the Oswego Canal, Frank lin Square Park, Washington Square Park, Westside and East Side Linear Parks, the Harbor Rail Trail, the Children's Museum of Oswego, the H. Lee White Maritime Museum, Fort Ontario, and the Safe Haven Holocaust Refugee Shelter Museum, among others, add richness and vibrancy to the city's residents and tourists. Over the past five years, the greater Oswego area has realized more than $632 million in new investments through nearly 60 separate projects, resulting in the creation or retention of over 1,200 jobs. During that same period, the city of Oswego has seen new private sector investments totaling nearly $84 million and the creation or retention of 610 jobs. Moreover, the Oswego Renaissance Association (ORA) , a nonprofit organization established to help revitalize the city's neighborhoods, has leveraged nearly $1 million in documented investments from foundation grants and private homeowners resulting in fa\u00e7ade improvements and exterior renovations to more than 200 near - downtown homes in approximately 24 months. Altogether, including 2016 funding, the ORA will exceed $1.5 million in leveraged private investment in fa\u00e7ade improvements, exterior renovations, streetscapes and park upgrades in less than 36 months. Overview of Community's Vision for Downtown Revitalization CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | 109 The transformation of the city of Oswego and its downtown has already begun and is generating momentum. It is a diverse community that is building on its strength, embracing its current, historic and natural assets, and positioning itself into a regionally competitive area while maintaining its small town charm. Over the past several years, excitement and investment has been building in the city of Oswego and its downtown. Historic buildings have been converted to mix-use commercial spaces and apartments, facades have been renovated, a diverse mix of tenants have moved into provide shopping vibrancy, parks have been restored, trees and flowers are being planted, attitudes are shifting and civic pride is at an all-time high. The ORA and their market -based neighborhood revitalization strategy has transformed downtown parks and neighborhoods. More importantly, the ORA has sparked a passion and mindset amongst community members to recognize the entire community's strengths, to begin to collaborate and invest. Recently, the city of Oswego embarked on several key planning initiatives that will increase the livability and quality of life in the downtown area and citywide. The city of Oswego is an active participant in the newly formed Oswego County Land Bank Corporation. Additionally, the city of Oswego is undergoing a Complete Streets planning project and a waterfront feasibility study. These key initiatives will result in projects that achieve measurable economic benefits for the larger community, while further enhancing the benefits of a DRI award. This combination of recent and ongoing investments together with the additional leverage cultivated through strategic public and private partnerships will ensure that the city of Oswego is poised and well-positioned to revitalize its downtown. Projects or Proposals that have been Preliminarily Identified The initial projects that have been identified for funding are a myria d concentrated investments that seek to transform the curb appeal of properties, transform streetscapes into walkable streets with modern amenities, and anchor projects that will fill in the missing teeth of development to create a more cohesive downtown experience. Identified projects are the city's 104 Streetscape Revitalization Project, which will utilize DRI funding to leverage a multimillion dollar Federal TIGER grant ; downtown streetscape enhancements; wayfinding signage; Downtown Business Fa\u00e7ade and Signage Improvements ; and near downtown neighborhood improvements to further the efforts of the ORA. The city has also preliminarily identified six anchor projects , specifically in its downtown area, that are ripe for investment and will continue to build upon the momentum which would result in an additional nearly $50 million private investment, and provide the opportunity to create and retain approximately 200 jobs. Midtown Plaza: Sutton Real Estate has proposed revitalizing a parking lot on a prominen t downtown intersection into a $9 million, mixed -use development with 24 market rate apartments and 20,000 square feet of commercial space.
