It was approved by Full Council in June 2021. The Corporate Plan priorities are delivered through specific programmes and projects, which are coordinated and resourced through cross -cutting strategic delivery plans, ca pital investment and departmental business plans. The key performance indicators (KPIs) and their associated targets detailed in this report for the thir d quarter of 2021 /22 (October to December 2021) tell us how we are doing in delivering what we have set out to achieve in the Corporate Plan. PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL CORPORATE PLAN PERFORMANCE REPORT Page 2 of 33 OFFICIAL The purpose of this report is to provide a risk -informed analysis of performance against the priorities of the Corporate Plan 2021-2025. The pri orities are grouped under 'unlocking the city's potential' and 'c aring for people and communities ', and the outc omes for ' delivering on our commitments ' - the enablers of the Corporate Plan - are also reported on. Direction of travel (RAG) colour scheme A red -amber -green (RAG) direction of travel rating is provided to give an indication of whether performance is improving or declining based on the two latest comparable periods for which information is available. For example, repeat referrals to Children's Social Care is compared to the previ ous qu arter; household waste sent for reuse, recycling or composting is compared to the same period in the previous year (due to seasonality); and annual measures, such as public satisfaction with traffic flow, are compared to the previous year. Indicators with arrows highlighted green: improved on the previous value or on an expected trend Indicators with arrows highlighted amber: within 15% of the previous value (slight decline) Indicators with arrows highlighted red: declined by more than 15% on the previous value Indicators with arrows that are not highlighted have no direction of travel or the most recent value is not comparable with previous values. Target (RAG) colour scheme A RAG target rating is applied for indicators that have a target. For these indicators, the bar for the latest reporting period is coloured either red, amber or green in the chart and in the table to visually display how we are performing compared with the target. Indicators highlighted green show where Plymouth is better than tar get Indicators highlighted amber show where Plymouth is within 15% of target Indicators highlighted red show where Plymouth is more than 15% worse than target Indicators not highlighted or 'N/A' show where no in year data is available to compare against ta rget, or no target has been set. Summary page A performance summary section is presented at the start of this report to visually display how we have performed against our Corporate Plan priorities. Our RAG rating on these pages is used to show whether we have done better, worse or had a slight decline from the previous quarter or year (coloured arrows), and whether we have done better, worse or got close to the target (coloured boxes ). Some indicators do not have a target (for example, due to being a new i ndicator) and will ther efore have no target RAG rating. Similarly, some of our indicators are new and we do not have any previous data to compare our performance to or it is not appropriate to compare to previou s data; these will have no direction of travel RAG rating in the summary pages. Description of key performance indicators Tables containing the names and descriptions of all of the key performance indicators featured within this report are presented at the end of the document. Impact of COVID -19 on performance The COVID -19 pandemic has had far reaching impacts across all services. Impacts that t he COVID -19 pandemic has had on performance is referenced throughout the report. The pandemic has also impact ed upon the ability to report on perf ormance against some indicators as we would have done so previously. Where performance against an indicator has not been able to be quantified, a narrative update has been provided in its place. The narrative outlines activity that has been undertaken or the challenges faced.

This is above our target but remains below the APSE (92.4%) and family group (91.6%) averages, with the gaps standing at 3.7 and 2.9 percentage points, respectively. The high score in April/May was influenced by an improvement in the score for hard surface weeds (86.7% acce ptable in Apr/May; previous high was 76.9% in Feb/Mar 2018/19). While performance has since declined, with 82.4% of the total inspected streets so far this year being acceptable for hard surface weeds, this remains high in comparison to previous years. A green sustainable city that cares about the environment A clean and tidy city PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL CORPORATE PLAN PERFORMANCE REPORT Page 7 of 33 OFFICIAL 4. Carbon emissions emitted by the council At the end of quarter three, 64% of all actions in the Corporate Carbon Reduction Plan (CCRP2) have been achieved and 36% have been achieved in part. The actions reported as achieved in part do so because the majority of their activities were realised but, because of COVID -19 and its knock on effects, some slippages were experienced. All of these actions have an 'achieve by' date, which all are anticipated to meet. There are no actions that have not been achieved. Some highlights from the CCRP2 actions achieved include: The district heating project successfully secured \u00a35 million of funding from two applications to the Public Sector Decarbonisation Fund, and a further \u00a336,500 was secured from Heat Networks Delivery Unit (HNDU) Round 10 towards district energy. Every new commercial tenant was provided with a Sustainable Occupancy Pack to encourage them to take action on carbon reduction initiatives. Seven electric bin lifts were purchased, installed and are now operating in the Fleet. A new approach was introduced to managing the city's green infrastructure, reducing the need for machinery and increasing carbon capture. A new tracker system that captures and reports the carbon dioxide emissions from all fleet vehicles h as been implemented. A pedestrian electric sweeper was purchased for the city centre and waterfront environment. More than 50% of road junctions have had LED traffic light replacement units fitted. The overall recycling rate for 2020/21 was 31.1%, which is below the comparable rate in previous years (35.8% in 2019/20), partly as a result of the COVID -19 lockdown, including the closure of our household waste recycling centres at the end of March 2020 and the suspension of garden waste collections until late August. Following the increase in quarter two to 40.1%, the recycling rate for quarter three dropped to 32.3% and is below the target of 39%. However, quarter two tends to see higher recycling rates than other quarters due to garden waste collections and so a decrease in quarter three is a trend that we see year on year. Due to the impacts of the pandemic, 2020/21 does not provide a like for like comparison with this year. When comparing to quarter t hree in 2019/20 (28.8%), there has been an increase of 3.5 percentage points. The Department for Transport (DfT) undertakes one day cycle counts on approximately 40 roads across the city, once a year, every year. This dataset provides a reasonab ly consist ent annual snap shot of levels of on road cycling in the city that can be used as an indicator of the extent of growth in the use of sustainable transport. The government's 2017 Cycling and Walking Strategy target is to double cycling by 2025. To support re aching the 2025 target of 256 cyclist counts in Plymouth, the 2020 target was 176. In 2020, Plymouth exceeded its target and the levels of cycling across the country is following similar trends. There has been increased investment through the Transforming Cities Fund and Active Travel Fund and we are hopeful that significant additional funding will be forthcoming in the years ahead to support the government's 2017 Cycling and Walking Strategy. The substantial increase from 2019 to 2020 can be attributed to travel choice changes brought about by COVID -19, but also partially attributed to cycling infrastructure and the complimentary Plymotion programme delivered by the council. Data for 2021 will be available later in 2022. PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL CORPORATE PLAN PERFORMANCE REPORT Page 8 of 33 OFFICIAL ` Annual KPI 2017/18 2018/19 2019/20 2020/21 Direction of travel Target 5.

We have delivered 5,836 net additional dwellings over the period 2014 to 2021 and are currently significantly ahead (by 1,216 dwellings) of the Plymouth LPA cum ulative target (4,620 net additional dwellings over the period 2014 to 2021). Of the 5,836 homes, 984 were affordable homes, which is an annualised average of 141 (17% of net housing delivery). However, this hides the significant amount of new affordable h ousing that has been delivered over the period (1,674 dwellings), accounting for 25% of gross housing delivery (6,682 dwellings). The major regeneration areas of Devonport, North Prospect and Barne Barton have seen the demolition of 690 poor quality afford able homes being replaced by the provision of new high quality affordable homes.

This equates to approximately \u00a353.259 million out o f a total spend of \u00a3227.375 million. Our current performance is marginally above the position at the end of quarter three 2020/21 (23.3%) but remains below our target of 26%. The actual SME spend for 2021/22 is approximately \u00a39 million more than the same p eriod in 2020/21. In quarter three, we did business with 416 SME suppliers. So far this year we have used 1,055 different SME suppliers, which translates to 37.9% of all of the suppliers that we have used being a SME (up on 36.9% at the end of quarter two) . Approximately \u00a3126.156 million has been spent on PL postcode suppliers in 2021/22 to date out of a total spend of \u00a3227.375 million, equating to 55.5%. This is slightly above the position at the end of quarter two (55.4%) and remains above our 54% target. T he actual spend with PL postcode suppliers has increased by around \u00a312 million when compared with the same period in 2020/21. During the first three quarters of 2021/22 we have procured goods and services through 1,555 suppliers based within the PL postcod e, which is 55.9% of the total number of suppliers used. At the end of quarter three, the proportion of 16 and 17 year olds in education, employment, and/or training (EET) is 90.7%.; this is better than the EET figures at the same time last year (89.7%). A t the end of quarter three, 83.7% of young people with Special Educational Needs and/or Disabilities (SEND) are in education, training and/or employment, which is slightly below EET figures at the end of quarter three 2020/21 (84.5%). Careers South West (C SW) advisers are focused on supporting those young people who still have not specified their intended destination or who have confirmed that they are not in education, employment or training (NEET). The local authority and CSW are developing a data sharing protocol to support young people who are electively home educated. This group of young people is identified as at risk of not engaging in post -16 provision as they may not receive high quality advice and guidance on career options or skills before the end of their statutory education. The employment rate of the working age population of Plymouth saw a steady increase from quarter one 2020/21 through to quarter four 2020/21. The first quarter of 2021/22 dipped from the end of the previous year but has seen a strong recovery in quarter two to 77.2%. Comparing this to the data for England, we see that for both quarters one and two of 2021/22, Plymouth had a higher employment rate than nationally. The COVID -19 pandemic has fundamentally altered the way in which Economic Development is currently supporting businesses. The latest estimate of the total number of unique businesses supported by the COVID -19 grants in Plymouth is 6,005. There was a significant reduction in businesses supported in quarter three compare d to quarter two. However, the first month of quarter four is showing a significant rise in the number of businesses supported. The department continues to collaborate and work with businesses to understand their pressures and offer as much support as poss ible. Despite the considerable negative impact of the COVID -19 pandemic and the level of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows falling globally, seven FDI projects successfully landed in Plymouth in the 2020/21 financial year, with a total value of \u00a3133,34 2,000 (this does not include the value of two of the project landings, which relate to the acquisition of two Plymouth companies). This accounts for the large majority of the total \u00a3194.339 million of inward investment in 2020/21. The ongoing pandemic has stifled investment projects locally and the number of landings is projected to drop again for the 2021/22 financial year. That being said, the pipeline for 2022/23 is strong with at least three projects in train, which are expected to complete within that financial year. We see this drop as a short term blip caused by uncertainty within the economy on the back of the pandemic. Our view is that growing consumer confidence will drive a growth in investments.

Number of visitors to Plymouth 5,170,000 5,420,000 5,279,000 2,436,000 Monitor COVID -19 hit the tourism, hospitality, leisure and retail sectors very hard during 2020; overall there was a 54% loss of visitors from 2019 and a 56% loss of spend - from \u00a3334 million down to \u00a3148.4 million. This was due to lockdowns from March to July and then again in the back end of the year. International travel was hit particularly hard, losing 74% of visitors. The COVID -19 impacts continue to be felt by the visitor sector in the city and nationally. Our modelling shows that although there was an avera ge uplift of 10% visitor spend over June to August due to 'staycations' in the region, it was not significant enough to offset the losses in the early part of the year. Currently we are forecasting a loss of over \u00a3270 million in spend for 2021 but we do no t yet have December's data; this will be reported in quarter four. Targets for 2021 onwards are being revised as we now have a new long term target forecast of 6.2 million visitors by 2030. Annual KPIs 2017 2018 2019 2020 Direction of travel Target 14.

By continuing our regime of monitoring, we have managed to make informed and targeted decisions about where we need to invest in our resilient highway network to ensure that optimal condition is maintained. The 2020 National H ighways and Transport (NHT) survey showed that public satisfaction with traffic levels and congestion improved significantly, with 44% of respondents being satisfied, closing the gap with the NHT average (46%) to two percentage points. We have seen the con tinuation of several network improvement programmes and remain focused on maintaining the quality and functionality of the resilient network in line with our Asset Management Framework. By the end of quarter three 2021/22, 1,602 of the total 1,631 carriage way defects were completed within the required timescales, equating to 98.2% and exceeding the target of 97% and the 96.8% achieved in 2020/21. This measure includes carriageway defects carried out over three differing priorities with different timescales for completion.

Residents who regularly do voluntary work - 43% 42% - Trend increase A friendly welcoming city The question about community cohesion was asked in the 2021 Resident Survey (same methodology as the Plymouth City Survey). Results show that 55% of respondents agreed that Plymouth is a place where people from different backgrounds get on well together, while 35% ans wered 'neither agree nor disagree' or 'don't know'. Plymouth's cohesion score is currently 86%; this excludes the neutral options and is a significant increase from 74% in 2020. We have used the \u00a3506,000 awarded by the Controlling Migration Fund to establi sh the Unify Plymouth Partnership, which aims to improve community cohesion in the four wards with the lowest cohesion scores. We have established a Community Cohesion Partnership in the four wards with the most challenging cohesion rates to develop an inclusive local vision statement. Four new Community Connectors have been appointed in the wards of Devonport, Efford and St Budeaux. As social distancing restrictions relax, the project now incorporates a mix of digital and face - to-face engagement activities , which have included small community gatherings; a programme of events to mark Black History Month; and delivery of the 'It started with Jack' programme. Further engagement through Appreciative Enquiry is due to take place alongside the start of the evalu ation process (via trained Community Researchers), and the launch of the Our Plymouth digital platform, which will assist in online engagement and making connections between communities in the targeted wards. This month sees the anniversary of opening the mass vaccination centre at Home Park; the first vaccine was given on the 25 January 2021. Home Park currently has 1,176 active volunteers to cover both the Steward and Shift Leader volunteer roles on site. With the exception of match days, the site is open 12 hours a day, seven days a week. A number of extra shifts have been tried, in particular a late night shift to give hospitality staff the opportunity to get a jab after work. Volunteers have now contributed over 84,000 hours, allowing the site to delive r just under 425,000 jabs so far. The South West as a whole delivered the most jabs anywhere in the country during December; a massive 76,500 vaccines, with Home Park seeing the highest daily number of 6,253 jabs, in ONE day. We are currently seeing record numbers of volunteers coming forward to book a shift. By mid -December there were no available volunteer shifts until January 5 and we are still seeing fill rates at 99% for the next couple of weeks. We also saw the c onclusion of the Mayflower 400 programm e - 400 Mayflower Makers dedicated 7,000 hours, worth over \u00a3100,000 to supporting events and activities. A need for a more coordinated approach to volunteering across Plymouth had already been identified prior to the COVID -19 pandemic. This was reinforced in the Mayflower 400 programme evaluation that identified the shifting of certain perceptions of volunteering as \"cheap labour\" to somethin g that needs upfront investment and dedicated management to fully realise the potential of such a resource. Twenty Pl ymouth Good Neighbours Support Vo lunteers have been recruited, trained and matched with vulnerable residents of Plymouth. Support Volunteers provide practical help on a weekly basis, collecting shopping and prescriptions for a vulnerable Plymouth resident and making time for a friendly chat with them. Plymouth City Council volunteers have supported the Plym outh Together Fund, helping to raise a total of \u00a3518.97 at the bonfire and Christmas light switch on events for the families and local communities impact ed by the Keyham tragedy.

School readiness There remains no requirement for schools and settings to submit data to the local authority or to confirm completion to the Department for Education. The decision has, therefore, been made to cancel th e data collection and its subsequent statistical releases in autumn 2020 and 2021. The revised Early Years Foundation Stage became statutory in September 2021. 2021/22 will be a year of transition for the sector and schools and settings will also need to a djust to changes in the Early Years Foundation Stage Profile assessment. There is evidence that the pandemic has had a significant impact on the communication and language development of children birth to five, which may affect long term learning and devel opment. In recognition of this, additional funding has be en made available from the COVID -19 Outbreak Management Fund to increase speech and language support. Plymouth City Council, Livewell and children's centres are working together to roll out the new e arly language identification measure (ELIM) to all two year old children. This assessment tool identifies difficulties early and enables early years staff to work with parents to implement strategies that improve speech and language development. This compl iments the Professional Development Project, which trains early years practitioners to improve speech and language for the children in their care. A drop in successful outcomes can be linked to a d rop in the ability to hold face -to-face engagement during the pandemic and re -prioritisation of follow up calls following provision of support due to COVID -19 related demands on the service. Smoking cessation remains a priority through delivery of our specialist services due to the importance of respiratory health. We are continuing our strategy of focusing the range of resou rces towards those with the greatest and most complex needs by targeting a range of support options for vulnerable groups. These groups including people in Plymouth who smoke and have severe and enduring mental ill -health, substance misuse needs and who ar e experiencing homelessness. The Swap to Stop offer of electronic cigarettes and behavioural support continues to improve the offer available and is expanding engagement. The Integrated Treating Tobacco Dependency Service with University Hospitals Plymouth continues to progress and embeds tobacco treatment in all of their pathways and 'making every contact count' (MECC) training within their organisation. Initially, the focus is with maternity services, then rolling out to key wards and the mental health ac ute unit and recovery. We also continue to take a system -wide approach to tobacco control through action that controls key supply side factors related to tobacco. Our Trading Standards colleagues in the newly commissioned Heart of the South West Trading St andards Service continue their vital work to disrupt and minimise the supply of illegal tobacco in the city and ensure that tobacco sales are appropriately restricted by age and point of sale restrictions are adhered to. There was no National Child Measure ment Programme (NCMP) undertaken across all primary schools nationally in the academic year 2020/2021 due to COVID -19. However, eight Plymouth schools contributed to a national representative sample of schools and statistical weighting was applied to the d ata to produce an estimate of obesity prevalence and key findings at a national level. In Year Reception, obesity prevalence has increased from 9.9% in 2019/20 to 14.4% in 2020/21. In Year 6, obesity prevalence has increased from 21.0% in 2019/20 to 25.5% in 2020/21. The data also illustrates that clear health inequalities exist. With regards to gender, boys have a higher obesity prevalence than girls at both Year Reception and Year 6. Additionally, 20.3% of Year Reception children living in the most depriv ed areas were obese compared to 7.8% of those living in the least deprived areas, while 33.8% of Year 6 children living in the most deprived areas were obese compared to 14.3% of those living in the least deprived areas. The aim is for the NCMP to be fully delivered this year subject to any further challenges with COVID -19. Planning continues for the new NHS England Tier 3 service across the whole south west, with a hub serving the Peninsula based at University Hospitals Plymouth. The pilot service is due t o commence before June 2022. Progress to develop a new community offer in Plymouth continues, with the aim to have this fully available for 1 April 2023. Work also continues via children 's centres, education settings, health professionals and the voluntary and community sector to support healthy weight through information, advice and support. 18.6% of Plymouth's total pupil population is registered as eligible for benefit based Free School Meals (FSM). This is a 3.8 percentage point increase on the previous year and continues to sit above the national and regional averages. There has been a 17.9% increase in the number of pupils known to be eligible for benefit based FSM between the 2019/20 and 2020/21 academic years; this can largely be attributed to the im pacts of COVID -19 on working families who previously paid for school meals or accessed Universal Infant FSMs now becoming eligible. Of those pupils who are eligible for benefit based FSMs, CATERed is supplying meals to just over 80%, meaning that almost 20 % of pupils in any period are not taking up their full entitlement. Throughout quarter three, pupil mobility continued to fluctuate and some schools have decided to continue to manage the delivery of lunch times outside of traditional dining spaces post COVID-19 isolation measures. Together, this has made service delivery inconsistent across the city and we are therefore unable to provide local data. CATERed, other providers and schools continue to support all eligible pupils with access to a full range of menu choices across all schools.

In addition to this, we received a number of reports and requests for service from our Police and Housing partners. The number of anti -social beha viour reports received by Community Connections in quarter three was significantly lower than in quarter two, with a 53% decrease on reports received in the previous quarter. However, this is to be expected with the end of the summer period, cooler weather and darker evenings. Furthermore, COVID -19 restrictions in relation to some larger Night Time Economy venues were reintroduced. There was a spike in youth 'gang' violence and ASB during this period. A partnership approach was undertaken through 'Op Hypura l' to successfully resolve this issue, diverting the majority of young people away from the groups and from causing further ASB. Where prevention, early intervention and support was not effective, other enforcement powers were used, including the issuing o f ASB1/ASB2 warnings and Civil Injunctions. The Community Safety Team is working closely with the Community Youth Team to provide diversionary activity, support and guidance at an early stage. In quarter three, five ASB1 warnings were issued to young peop le under the age of 18 who were involved in group related ASB. These early interventions have all been effective (to date) as they resulted in no further need for enforcement action. Two ASB1 warnings were issued to adults over the age of 18 years - one in relation to begging and the other for neighbour -related harassment. Three Community Protection Notice warnings were issued for neighbour -related ASB where earlier attempts at intervention had not been successful. None of these interventions escalated to t he requirement for further enforcement action, such as Community Protection Notices, within this quarter. We continue to work with the Police surrounding the ASB1 and ASB2 tools to ensure their use and encourage early intervention and prevention. In 2020, 90% of residents who completed the Plymouth City Survey felt safe outside in their local area during the day, with only 3% feeling either fairly or very unsafe. Safer Plymouth has developed to become a trauma informed community safety partnership. A propos al was developed in conjunction with the Trauma Informed Plymouth Network to refresh the identity of the partnership and to improve efficiency and flexibility in how we operate through new governance arrangements. This has proved to be effective, in partic ular in the readiness to deliver against the new duties on the local authority brought about by the new Domestic Abuse Act and in readiness for the future delivery of the Serious Violence Bill. Focus on prevention and early intervention PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL CORPORATE PLAN PERFORMANCE REPORT Page 19 of 33 OFFICIAL At the end of quarter three, the percentage of re -referrals over a rolling 12 month period was 22.9%, equating to 817 of the 3,565 referrals received in the last 12 months being for children and young people who we had already received a referral for during the 12 month s prior. Within quarter three, 194 (21.7%) of the 896 referrals received were repeat referrals. We are currently at a better level than our statistical neighbours (23.3% for 2020/21) and comparable with the England average (22.7%). During quarter three, 20 7 households were prevented from becoming homeless or relieved of their homelessness, which is an increase of 23 on the previous quarter. However, there were some applications received late in the quarter that might progress to a prevention. The service me t the target of 500 households supported last year, and has achieved the target of 654 in the first nine months of 2021/22. The ongoing impact of COVID -19 on homelessness is influencing the ability to prevent/relieve homelessness in the same approach and t imescales as pre -pandemic. The value for rough sleeping is based on the average of a one day snapshot reported each week during the period. On average during quarter three, eight people were seen rough sleeping each week. Numbers of rough sleepers were consistently a little higher during the majority of quarter two but have been managed down in quarter three. Early indications in quarter four are that numbers are remaining steady and are consistently in single figures. In 2020/21, the number of admission s to residential/nursing care of people aged 65 and over remained relatively static when compared to 2019/20. Last year there were 242 long term admissions, compared to 253 the previous year. Between 1 April and 31 December 2021 there have been 180 admissi ons; lower numbers in September mean that we are on a trajectory to see slightly lower numbers than 2020/21.

This is a net increase of 68 children since the first national lockdown started. Our rate per 10,000 children is currently 93.8, which is slightly above our sta tistical neighbour average (published at 92.2r for 2020/21), and 26.8 children per 10,000 more than the England average. In the 12 months up to the end of quarter three 2021/22, 107 (27.0%) of 397 new Child Protection Plans were for children who had alread y been on a Child Protection Plan at some point in their lifetime (down 0.2 of a percentage point on quarter two). Within the quarter, 46 (34.6%) of the 133 new Child Protection Plans were repeat Plans. Between 1 October 2021 and 31 December 2021, 211 individuals were the subject of a completed safeguarding enquiry, 139 of which expressed a desired outcome at the start of the enquiry (65.9% compared to 71.7% in quarter two). The percentage of people not a sked about their preferred outcome increased for the second consecutive quarter to 26.5% (18.6% in quarter two). The percentage of outcomes that have been either fully or partially achieved increased in quarter three to 98.6% (137), from 94.4% in quarter t wo. The percentage fully achieved decreased to 66.2% (92) (69.8% in quarter two). No annual Statutory Adult Social Care Survey was carried out in 2020/21 due to COVID -19. Performance had declined in the past two years before improving slightly in 2019/20, with 90% of respondents agreeing that the adult social care (ASC) services that they receive make them feel safe. In response to the 2018/19 survey results, an ASC performance action plan aimed at improving outcomes was put in place and there have been sm all increases in performance against both this indicator and the ASCOF 4A, which measures how safe people feel in general. Improved schools where pupils achieve better outcomes PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL CORPORATE PLAN PERFORMANCE REPORT Page 22 of 33 OFFICIAL Since September, Ofsted have resumed their pre -pandemic inspection regime and this data reflects the return to a normal status quo. Since the introduction of the revised Early Years Foundation Stage in September 2021, two of Plymouth's settings have received an outstanding judgement from Ofsted, two have received a good judgement and two settings that were judged i nadequate are now judged as good. On 1 January 2021 there were 85 Private, Voluntary and Independent (PVI) settings and 109 childminders on the Early Years regist er, while on 2 February 2022 there were 79 PVI settings and 93 childminders on the register. This decline is attributed to the impacts of COVID - 19, staff recruitment and retention, finances, and a falling birth rate; work is in place to help the sector wit h these issues and there is sufficient childcare. Currently, 95.6% of nurseries and pre -schools and 97.6% of childminders are rated good or better, compared to 98% and 96% nationally, respectively. Overall, 97% of Plymouth's Early Years settings are judged good or better, which is on par with the national average. Graded inspections resumed at the start of the 2021/22 academic year. There are 98 state -funded schools in the city and, at the end of quarter three, 71.1% of pupils are attending a school judged as good or outstanding. 76% of our schools have an overall judgement of good or outstanding (78% of primary schools, 50% of secondary schools and 100% of special schools). This is an improvement on the last available report for the 2018/19 academic year wh en 72% of our schools were judged as good or outstanding. Nationally, 86% were judged good or outstanding in 2018/19. The Plymouth Strategic (Secondary) Education Group continues to provide momentum for the place based approach for secondary school improve ments, reporting directly to the Plymouth Education Board and the Regional Schools Commissioner. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, all summer 2021 exams were cancelled. This attainment data reflects the GCSE grades awarded to pupils in August 2021 through cent re (school based) assessed grades. As a result, the 2019/20 and 2020/21 data should not be directly compared to attainment data from previous years for the purposes of measuring changes in student performance. The percentage of pupils achieving the 'basics ' (5+ in English and Maths) is 51.9% and now sits above the recently validated and published national and statistical neighbour averages, although slightly below the regional average. The city's education improvement partnerships and the Plymouth Strategic (Secondary) Education Group continues to provide momentum for the place based approach for secondary school improvements, reporting directly to the Plymouth Education Board and the Regional Schools Commissioner.

Staff engagement Employee engagement occurs daily on both a formal and informal basis across the council. It encompasses the employee life cycle, starting with onboarding (introduction to the organisation and role) and induction and concluding with exit i nterviews. Views from employees are gathered from employee surveys. The most recent 'Wellbeing Survey' was carried out in August and saw a varied response, with 17.2% of our 500 frontline employees responding and 54.0% of the remaining employees (approxima tely 2,000) responding. This gave an overall response rate of 46.6%. All comments from the survey were themed and have been shared with the Corporate Management Team to give them a full understanding. The results were published on Staff Room (staff intrane t) in early January. Planning is now underway for the 'Big Listen', which is the full employee engagement survey and will launch in June 2022. Another channel for listening to employees' thoughts is through 'Tea with Tracey' - these sessions have focused o n the protected characteristics and given the Chief Executive the opportunity to listen to employees in these groups. Additionally, online 'Q&A' engagement sessions chaired by our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and senior managers have taken place on 'Demys tifying the Council budget', 'Equalities and Diversity' and 'New of Working'. Empowering our people to deliver The number of days lost per full time equivalent (FTE) for the council as a whole increased to 8.50 days at the end of quarter three (up 1.02 days on quarter two), and is currently a day and a half above the target of 7.0 days or less. When compared agains t the same quarter of 2020/21, the number of days lost is currently 0.48 of a day higher. These figures are inclusive of COVID -19 sickness; this has not been significant, with a total of 152 employees recorded as having COVID -19 since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020. Musculoskeletal (excluding back/neck) is the top reason for long term sickness, whilst cold/flu is the top reason for short term sickness. During quarter three, managers have been reminded that all Display Screen Equipment (DSE) as sessments and homeworker checklists must be up to date and this is constantly being reviewed. There will be further requirements for these assurances during the transition to New Ways of Working. We will be issuing communication to the workforce of the nee d to take regular breaks from their workstation and create times between meetings. Approaches have been made to working in partnership with local training organisations for proactive treatment for employees who are experiencing early musculoskeletal sympto ms. Flu clinics took place on various workplace locations during this quarter to maximise protection of our front line workers. Our wellbeing offering is broad and varied and we are working towards the gold standard for Wellbeing at Work. PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL CORPORATE PLAN PERFORMANCE REPORT Page 25 of 33 OFFICIAL 3. Customer experience score Financial year Q1 Q2 Q3 a quality service to get the basics right first time The customer experience score is an index KPI that takes into account performance against a number of indicators that are focused on the customer. Currently, this indicator considers customer complaints resolved in expected timescales; Freedom of Informati on (FOI) requests completed within 20 working days; the time taken to process new claims for Housing Benefit and Council Tax Support; percentage of bins reported as missed by customers; and the number of households prevented from or relieved of homelessnes s. Two points are allocated when an indicator is achieving target, one for a KPI that is amber against target (within 15%) and none for a KPI that is red against target (more than 15% away). The score is then represented as a percentage of the maximum scor e possible. 78.3% of stage one complaints resolved in quarter three were resolved within the timeframe of 10 working days. This is a reduction on quarter two, in which we achieved 86.3%, due to a focus on resolving older out of time complaints within the quarter. We will continue to work on improving our response time to customer feedback. Of the complaints resolved within the month, 24.3% were upheld, which is an improvement on quarter two's upheld rate (26.3%). The number of complaints rece ived in quarte r three 2021/22 also increased (1,853) when compared with quarter two (1,777), while we received fewer compliments in quarter three (112) than in quarter two (137). We were due to close 250 Freedom of Information (FOI) requests in quarter three 2021/22, 2 25 of which were closed within the timeframe of 20 working days, equating to 90.0% and equalling the target (also 90%). This is an increase in the number of requests due from quarter two but a small reduction in timeliness (232 FOIs due in quarter two; 93. 1% completed on time). The average time taken to process new Housing Benefit claims increased in quarter three 2021/22 to 19.7 days, against a target of 18 days. However, monthly performance shows this to have been affected by higher processing times in October due to the increase in the number of new claims received as the furlough scheme ended; the average number of claims received each week in the period 20/09/21 to 11/10/21 was 158 compared to 98 in the preceding four week period. Processing times did improve in November and December and were at or below target. Quarter one of 2020/21 saw the beginning of national COVID -19 restrictions, leading to an increase in the volume of Council Tax Support (CTS) claims that we received. The CTS caseload for worki ng age customers at the end of 2020/21 had increased by 28.7% from the previous year, from 12,089 to 15,555. The CTS caseload has continued to increase this year, reaching a peak of 15,772 working age customers at the end of July 2021 before falling back s lightly to 15,671 at the end of January. The processing time for CTS new claims averaged 24.2 days in quarter three against a target of 18 days, with resource continuing to be allocated to administer the Test and Trace Support Payment scheme.

Councillors have different ways of engaging with residents in their wards, meaning that residents have direct access to their elected representative and the council has an established mechanism for consulting on proposals, such as planning applications. For the second successive survey, the youngest age group was significantly less likely to agree that they know how to get invol ved, with 7.5% of respondents aged 16 to 24 years agreeing compared with 34.9% of those aged 25 years and older. Providing value for money PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL CORPORATE PLAN PERFORMANCE REPORT Page 27 of 33 OFFICIAL The forecast revenue outturn after the application of COVID -19 grants and council mitigating actions is currently estimated at \u00a30.526 million over budget, which is a variance of +0.10% against the council's overall budget forecast (\u00a3514 million) and a reduction of \u00a30.203 million from quarte r two. This is the quarter three position for 2021/22 and it should be noted that the financial position will fluctuate as we move through the year. Officers and Members will work closely to manage the finances towards a balanced position by the end of the year. 81.84% of council tax had been collected by the end of quarter three 2021/22, which is an improvement on both 2020/21 (81.30%) and 2019/20 (81.81%) and only marginally below the target (81.86%), indicating a continued return to more normal levels of council tax collection following the impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic. This equates to \u00a3119.446 million that has been collected in 2021/22 to date, which again is more than the amount collected by the same point in both 2020/21 and 2019/20. 77.2% of busin ess rates had been collected by the end of quarter three 2021/22, equating to \u00a360.730 million. This is now above the year to date target of 76.0%. The figure refl ects the fact that all retail and leisure properties were required to start paying 34% rates f rom 1 July 2021. We have reviewed around 100 accounts and removed relief where the businesses have not confirmed that they are entitled. Any further relief that is removed will also affect the collection rate in the short term. PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL CORPORATE PLAN PERFORMANCE REPORT Page 28 of 33 OFFICIAL 8. Offers and Asks Our public affairs activity remains focused on the priority areas for the council and city and we continue to engage with ministers and senior civil servants on a range of issues that are important to Plymouth. We are continuing to make our voice heard throu gh hosting ministers and civil servants and responding to government consultations. Notable visits to the city include civil servants from the Levelling Up Unit and HM Treasury in September who came to hear from a range of partners and businesses about wha t additional government support is needed to address Plymouth's challenges and help the city to grow. This was followed by a visit from Jeremy Pocklington - the Permanent Secretary at the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities - in October, w ho visited a number of key development sites across the city and heard about our high potential economic opportunities, as well as the work being undertaken by our Supporting Families Team. Dame Rachel De Souza, the Children's Commissioner, also visited Pl ymouth in October to learn about the wide range of preventative work being carried out in the city to improve the lives of children and young people, as well as some of the key priorities and challenges. We also provided a submission to HM Treasury's Spen ding Review 2021, setting out what we see as the key national policy changes required to unlock the future potential of the city. Announced as part of the Spending Review was \u00a319.9 million from the Government's Levelling Up Fund for the Woolwell to the Geo rge transport scheme and up to \u00a350,000 to develop early -stage proposals to reinstate passenger rail links between Tavistock and Plymouth through the Restoring Your Railway 'Ideas Fund'. The Government also announced up to \u00a390 million of funding for new Community Forests across the country, including in Plymouth and South Devon, helping to meet commitments to plant at least 7,500 hectares of trees every year in England by 2025. In addition, the National Marine Park and Stonehouse Union were awarded over \u00a31 m illion between them from the Government's new Community Renewal Fund, announced in November. The Box was also successful in receiving \u00a3146,500 of government support through the Culture Recovery Fund as it continues its recovery from the challenges of the C OVID -19 pandemic. 9. Regional influence Plymouth City Council is continuing to work with Devon County Council and Torbay Council to develop a Devolution Deal with government. The D eal would seek to draw down powers and funding that currently sit with central government departments. The Deal will enable partners to have greater influence and flexibility in supporting areas such as education, skills and employment, transport, housing delivery and social inclusion, and to support action to tackle climate change. It may also be possible to achieve greater local flexibility over health and social care. The Council is also continuing to provide leadership and support for the Heart of the South West Joint Committee, and working in partnership with the Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP), whilst still a waiting the publication of the Government's Levelling Up White Paper. The White Paper is expected to provide greater clarity on new UK f unding streams, d evolution deals, and regional working structures, and potentially on the future role of LEPs. The nature of the Joint Committee is likely to alter within the coming months to reflect anticipated changes to the role of the LEP, and the formation of a new council for the whole of Somerset.
