( [Local link](https://www.otizvora.com/files2019/Vaccine_Statement_Med_Section_IVAA-15-April-2019.pdf) / [Official](https://www.ivaa.info/latest-news/article/article/anthroposophic-medicine-statement-on-vaccination/)) Using purely materialistic pseudo facts (see examples below) as a base for their opinion, taking into account\" some undisclosed socioeconomic risk factors\", and taking sides in an ongoing and neverending dispute, as of April 15, 2019, the Medical Section at the Goetheanum and IVAA will embrace the mainstream narrative that supports vaccines \u2014 all of them, including the undeniably dangerous ones; absolutely no exceptions have been mentioned. Furthermore the authors of the so called Statement are hiding behind the logos of the Medical Section at the Goetheanum and IVAA. The document has not been signed. No one was brave or honest enough to declare his or her name for the pro-Statement\" as author of the document. Thus, no one is taking any responsibility for his or her position. An anonymous statement is no statement at all The only name that can be seen in the ridiculous pamphlet is that of Elisa Baldini. We learned that she's ready to be contacted for further information\". But is she a doctor? A nurse maybe? A medical trainee at least? \u2014 No, no, and no. Is she competent enough to provide information on vaccines and vaccination schedules? \u2014 Sure, why not! Apparently, she's been supported by the best in the business, especially by the vaccine selling and GMO producing Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. (Link: [https://www.impatientoptimists.org/Authors/B/Elisa-Baldini](https://www.impatientoptimists.org/Authors/B/Elisa--Baldini)) Now, let's take a closer look at some of the anonymous statements in the document \u2014 statements that have never been peer reviewed: Vaccines... are currently allowing the world to approach the elimination of polio.\" Reality check, just two clicks away: \u00bb [491,000 Children Paralyzed Over 17 Years, Indian Polio Vaccine Program Study Suggests](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/491000-children-paralyzed-over-17-years-indian-polio-vaccine-program-study-sugges) \u00bb [Polio Vaccines Now The #1 Cause of Polio Paralysis](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/polio-vaccines-now-1-cause-polio-paralysis) Vaccines... allowed the eradication of small pox\" Yet another controversial fact\". Anyways... is the eradication of smallpox a good thing according to the Anthroposophic worldview? Rudolf Steiner is the only true Anthroposophic authority on this matter. He says (GA 120, L8): Let us suppose that a great number of people, because of uncharitableness, had been impelled to absorb certain infectious germs, so that they succumbed to an epidemic. Let us further suppose we were in a position to protect them from this epidemic. We should in such a case preserve the physical body from the effects of uncharitableness, but we should not have removed the inner tendency towards uncharitableness. The case might be such that, in removing the external expression of uncharitableness, we should undertake the duty of influencing the soul also in such a way as to remove from it the tendency towards a lack of charity. The organic expression of uncharitableness is killed in the most complete sense, in the external bodily sense, by vaccination against smallpox. There, for instance, the following becomes manifest, and has been investigated by Spiritual Science. In one period of civilisation, when there prevailed a general tendency to develop a higher degree of egotism, and uncharitableness, smallpox made its appearance. Such is the fact. In anthroposophy it is our bounded duty to give expression to the truth.\" What is the real (anthroposophic) vaccine\" against smallpox? Unsurprisingly, it has nothing to do with what Big Pharma and other Ahrimanic forces have to offer. The following is from Rudolf Steiner's Young Doctors Course: Lecture VII: Let us take a specific case. I will construct quite an idealistic one \u2014 the true therapy of smallpox. Real smallpox calls up a very strong inspiration, with intuition as well. And the knowledge that comes to you here, when you are real therapists in this domain, works much more strongly upon you \u2014 when it is real knowledge \u2014 does a vaccination; in a different sense it works much more strongly, and in studying the therapy of smallpox as a physician you will bring about a kind of healing in yourself in advance, prophylactically, and will therefore be able, when you understand the connection, to go among smallpox patients without fear, and full of love.\" Also, in a dedicated paragraph, the frivolous document by the Goetheanum and the IVAA dares to state\": Anthroposophic Medicine fully appreciates the contribution of vaccines to global health and firmly supports vaccination as an important measure to prevent life threatening diseases. Anthroposophic Medicine is not anti-vaccine and does not support anti-vaccine movements.\" So, once again the anonymous Anthroposophic Medicine\" declares unconditional (no matter what\") support for all vaccines \u2014 with no exceptions whatsoever. Shockingly for some, it means that the Goetheanum supports even the most grotesque and soul-crushing vaccines that have been predicted and described by Rudolf Steiner. Here's an eye opening example: I have told you that the spirits of darkness are going to inspire their human hosts, in whom they will be dwelling, to find a vaccine that will drive all inclination towards spirituality out of people's souls when they are still very young, and this will happen in a roundabout way through the living body. Today, bodies are vaccinated against one thing and another; in future, children will be vaccinated with a substance which it will certainly be possible to produce, and this will make them immune, so that they do not develop foolish inclinations connected with spiritual life \u2014 'foolish' here, of course, in the eyes of materialists.\" (GA 177, L13: The Fallen Spirits' Influence in the World) These words filled the Goetheanum lecture hall on October 27, 1917. Now, a mere century later, the Medical Section at the Goetheanum appears to be occupied and run by the human hosts of dark spirits\", declaring their balls-to-the-wall support of (all) vaccines. Not only is such a declaration an abdication from Anthroposophy, it represents an act of treason against Rudolf Steiner in particular, and a crime against humanity in general If the anonymous Medical Section\" at the Goetheanum sides with the enemies of humanity and does not support (any) anti-vaccine movements\", then the Anthroposophic Movement should part ways with the pseudo-Anthroposophic Society in question. The separation of the Anthroposophic Movement (globally) from the compromised Anthroposophic Society (in Dornach) is yet another unfortunate tendency that has been foreseen by Rudolf Steiner himself. A true supporter of Rudolf Steiner's legacy is required to speak the Truth, and the Truth alone! Always. No matter the circumstances he or she may be going through. This rule has no exceptions. Physicians with training in Anthroposophic Medicine are expected to act in accordance with national legislation and to carefully advise patients (or their caregivers) to help them understand the relevant scientific information and national vaccination recommendations.\" Expected by whom?! On whose authority? What happened to freedom? Is the Medical Section of the Goetheanum turning into yet another state/global health police\" unit? Adopting politically correct\" identities is incompatible with Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophy And anonymous people are in NO position to demand and/or expect anything. Their authority\" is a figment of their own delusional fantasy. As to those of you, faceless people, who have \"stated\" your lack of support for us all, anthroposophists true to Spiritual Science and Steiner's indications on the harm of vaccines, well... we do NOT need your support. Actually, in view of your stance on vaccines, it is the other way around \u2014 YOU, anonymous ladies and gentlemen, are the ones in desperate need of serious help. Let us help you by reminding you that that the Karma of untruthfulness is merciless, and also that the road to perdition is paved with good intentions\". No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else: he will hold to the one, and despise the other, Ye cannot serve God and Mammon (aka Ahriman). (Matthew 6:24) Hopefully, the Goetheanum in Dornach will heal itself from the inside out, and won't bleed out in this most pathetic way: serving false deities and corporate interests.
