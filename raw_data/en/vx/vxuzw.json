The concept of Heard Immunity to prevent the spread of novel Corona virus is also a matter of serious study. The literature in Unani system of medicine show the use of Broad Spectrum Antiviral Prophylactic Medicine (BSAPM) to induce immunity and Heard immunity against various types of virus infected diseases. The ancient empirical evidence proves that the heard immunity through administration of BSAPM shown that the pandemic called the \"Anthonine Plaque\" of 165 to 180 AD (Plaque of Galen) was successfully eradicated. Thus, there is a need to take a scientific study of BSAPM (Unani) to prevent the spread of novel corona virus. This paper deals with BSAPM (Unani) with comparative study of poly-protein strategy and heard immunity concept, the two experiments widely discussed among the scientific community as a measure to prevent the spread of novel corona virus.
