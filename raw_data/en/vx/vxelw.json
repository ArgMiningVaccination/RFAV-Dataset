GGThere is a sense of no-one being 'home'. 30 31 David's Story As I watched the death of my partner , his 'consciousness' appeared to lift out of his body steadily over a period of days - with the process appearing to accelerate in the last fe w hours of his life. It started with his feet, moving upwards. His head and upper body were the last areas to appear animated by his 'life force' before his consciousness finally separated fr om his physical shell. I sat with my partner's body for some hours after the moment of physical death. I felt as if my vigil was supporting the depar ture of his spirit, and it also gave me an opportunity to let g o and begin my grieving proce ss. WHEN DEATH HAPPENS In medical terms the dying process is viewed as a biological clos ing down of the body's systems. It is difficult to know dur ing this process when the person's conciousness dies. However, the moment of death can be experienced in many ways. It can be an intens ely spiritual encounter. Alternatively, it may feel rather prosaic. The essence of the person has gone, leaving behind a body that can s eem like an empty envelope. 32 Denise's Story I knew that my father was going to di e that day and decided to leave him alone with my mother. I had no problem leaving him as he had told me he w as 'ready to go', wasn't frightened and very cal m. We spent a lot to time talking while I nursed him, and without actually saying it, we had said our goodbyes. I wandered around until I just felt that he had di ed, returning home to find he had indeed died 20 minutes before. I felt mixe d emotions of relief, as he was no longer sufferi ng and fearful. I had not seen a dead body before. I stood nervously, with my back to the wall, at a distance, plucking up the courage to approach. It was then I felt the pressure of hands on my shoulders and a voice whispering in my ear 'I'm OK'. Thi s was followed by the overwhelming sensation of a very strong force moving far away with immense speed. I knew it was my father. Any fear I had I felt melted away. It gave me the strength to deal with the duti es associated with death. Much later I realised this experience had removed my fear of dying. You may feel grief. You may feel numb. You may fee l relief. It may feel like an anti-climax - especially in a hospital or institution, where nursing staff may be coming in and out to deal w ith necessary practicalities. If it's what you want, staff may also leave you alone for a while with the body - and that can be both reassur ing and sometimes unexpectedly peaceful. Sometimes, those present report less immediately ph ysical experiences. Carers and relatives may talk of seeing vapours leaving or hovering over the body. Others have described loving light filling the roo m or a sudden change in room temperature. Or there m ay be a heaviness in the air which takes time to clear. Or there may be other strange phenomena. Relatives and friends who were not there may experie nce 'seeing' or sensing the dead person and knowing the exact time of death before they are officially informed. These 'visitations' are usually comforting and reassuring, and never forgotten. 33 WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT TO FEEL IMMEDIATELY AFTER It's not unusual after someone has di ed, especially when you were present at the time, to feel disconnected from people, places or things. It can feel as if you are in a dream, or looking at life through frosted glass. This can be especially difficult when you are thr own into the intensi ty of making funeral arrangements. It can be hard to explain how you are feeli ng, especially to those who have never witnessed a death. But feeli ng strange or disc onnected from reality is understandable when we have watc hed someone die . Life will never be the same again. It can't be when we have witnessed something as profound as this. You may feel you don't know what to do with yourse lf. You can find yourself aimlessly wandering around, feeling lost and alone and deeply questioning everything in your l ife. Over the following weeks and months , for some there may be emotional and spiritual rawness that throws up feel ings of anger as well as grief. For others, it can be truly liberating. We onl y really know what we need to deal with as we go through our grieving process. 34 Sue's Story When my mother died I experienced something 'leave ' with her last breath. It was for me quite a spiritual encounter. For several days after I also felt something intangible but very real leave me. Yet at the same time I experienced a sense of my mother's essence settling into me. It35 felt uncomfortable and disconcerting , and it was a couple of weeks before I felt 'me' again. In the longer term, I realised I had absorbed something of my mother's spirit, and that continues to live within me. It was different with my father who died seven years later. At the moment of his death it felt to me more l ike a switching off than something actually leaving his body. I then realised that the moment of death happens in different way s. The feelings I subsequently experienced were the same when my mother died, only sharply intensified. It was hard to accept I no longer had parents. Even though I have a family of my own, I felt alone and as if I was no longer attached to anything - made more poignant when clearing the home they had s hared for over thirty - five years. Much of this ended up i n plastic bins bags with a charity shop. I think that was the saddest part - and t he awareness that this will happen to me too one day. THINGS RELATIVES MIGHT NEED TO THINK ABOUT... Stopping Life-Extending Treatment Many people make it known that they would not wish to be resuscitated or to receive life-prolonging treatment i f their quality of life was to suffer due a debilitating illness. For other pati ents, when it is clear to the medical team that treatment is not helping their c ondition, and that they are beginning to die, the doctors will decide to begin t o stop, or withdraw these treatments. In the case of an emergency admission to hospital, for example after a major stroke or heart attack, you ma y feel it necessary to inform medical staff about the wishes of your relative. However, it is important to understand that any decision to stop l ife-extending treatment is jointly made with doctors, and no pressure w ill be put on you for this to happen. The doctors will usually try to under stand your thoughts, but they are not asking for your permission to with draw life-prolonging treatments. It can be very upsetting to be in volved in such discussions on behalf of a relative who is unable to make their wishes known for the mselves. So, take your time to talk through any conc erns you may have with medical staff, and also with other relatives. Once a decision to withdraw life-pr olonging treatment has been reached, your relative may be placed on an E nd-of-Life Care Pathway, and i t will be clearly stated in their medical notes. When initiating an End-of-Life Care Pathway, doctors and nurses focus on making the person as comfortable a s possible. Fluids may be stopped and the person will receive only essenti al medication for the relief of distressing symptoms (pain-relief, anti-sickness drugs, etc.), and nursing care such as regular mouth-care, washing and tur ning. Nursing staff m ay also insert a catheter into the bladder and give medication to ease the secretions in the back of the throat when the person is no longer able to cough. 36 It is difficult to gauge how long someone may take to die. For those sitting with the dying it can often feel like a very long time. You may also at times feel distressed - and even guilty - ab out your relative being on an End-of- Life Care Pathway. However, it may help you to know that this offers the most comfort for your relative, and support for you and your family. The Family The death of a close relative is a cri tical time for families. Althou gh it usually falls to the immediate next of kin to provide support and care, the dying process can bring about a togetherness within the extended family unit that usually only happens on anniversarie s and holidays. Th is togetherness can be - although sad - a wonderful shared experience for all concerned. Having said that, death - especial ly of the second parent - can bring back into focus family feuds and other unresolved issues which may have lain dormant for years. This may be a good time to re solve past hurts and grievances. However, do be aware that emotions will be runni ng high, and tempers can fray. 37 Sally's Story I had never seen a dead person. Mum was to be my first and I was uncertain how it would happen, what it would be like and how I would know when she was dead. All four of us sat together round Mum's bed, taking turns to hold her hand and chatting quietly, all individually tr ying to prepare ourselves for losing this impor tant person in our lives . Around 4.00pm, Mum's breathing became v ery laboured, stopped once or twice and then finally, an hour or so later, she stopped breathi ng altogether and died. It was an incredibly emotional moment. My younger sister and I wept loudly, my older sister left the room in tears to be alone, and my brother stood silently at the end of Mum' s bed, just staring at her body in disbelief. I shall never forget it. It was an honour and pri vilege to be there and share that experience with my family. Family members can react differentl y. For example: GSome will have had a warm relationship with the dyi ng person. Others may be harbouring dislike, grudges or anger. GSome will freely embrace what is happening. Others may want to deny that the person is dying. GSome will be happy to stop life-extending treatment. Others may not want this. GSome may feel horrified or even sickened by the pe rson's deterioration, and find it difficult to sit with them. GRelatives who live at a distance may feel guilty for not bei ng there. Others may avoid contact due to family conflict. GRelatives who care for the dying person may feel their own l ife is on hold, and become angry and resentful with the rest of the family for not pulling their weight. GSibling rivalry may surface and divide loyalties, causing further resentments and disputes. GSome may be holding on to secrets that no-one else knows, and be finding this distressing. So, be prepared for this to be an intense ti me which needs patience and understanding, and a willingness to comm unicate openly and truthfully with the rest of the family. Locations At home Many people prefer to die at home surrounded by familiar belongings, and where friends can come and go. If you and your dyi ng relative want this to happen, talk through the prac ticalities with your GP and District Nurse to see if this is feasible. 38 As main carer you are more in control of what is happening to your dy ing relative than, for example, in hospital.Your GP and D istrict Nurse will be your main source of medical support, or Macmillan Nurses if your relative is dying of a terminal illness. With their help you may need to arrange with your local Health Authority for special equipment such as an air mattress, special bed and lifting equipment to be supplied Although rewarding, caring for someone at hom e can be physically and emotionally demanding. You need to think about your ow n needs. So it is important to find extra help to give you s upport, and time for breaks and sleep. Hospices Many hospices are run by charitable trusts dedicated to helping those with terminal illness. Due to the nature of their work, hos pices provide a range of services and support for relatives of the dying, or those nearing the end of their life. Most hospices are short-stay. They w ork towards stabilising terminally-ill patients to enable them to spend qual ity time at home be fore being readmitted, if required, for the final w eeks or days. Often hospices have special rooms set aside for relatives to rest or to stay overnight. Nursing Homes Nursing homes, which are either pr ivately owned or run by the National Health Service, cater for long-term el derly residents who are no longer able to cope on their own. However, family members can feel guilty for putting their relative into a nursing home, espec ially when the person has been fiercely independent. Consequently visi ts may become emotionally demanding and stressful for both resident and relative. Nursing Home staff usually encourage regular visi ts from relatives, and are eager to consult relatives on continui ng treatment and c are of the elderly person, especially when the resident's health is failing. They do not usually provide rooms for relatives to stay overnight, but are normally happy for you to spend as much time as possible with the person who is dying. 39 Hospitals: More than half of us die in hospitals . Hospitals are bustling, busy, noisy places which deal in helping people to g et well. There are minimal facilities for relatives who spend ex tended periods of time with a dying person. You may be lucky enough for your relative to be put into a s ide- room. Insist on this if you can. Other wise, your relative will be put in the main part of the ward, which can add to an already dis tressing situation. Essentially, hospital may be the bes t place for your relative or fri end to die, especially if they require specialised nurs ing care. Consequently it is important not to feel guilty if, for example, the dyi ng person cannot be taken home. Usually you will be allowed to visit or remain at the be side for as long as you wish. Practicalities to consider Here are a few suggestions to help y ou cope, whether your dy ing relative is in a hospice, nursing home or hos pital. GFirst of all, be prepared to c ancel your life! When someone is dying you will probably find it impossible to do or to think of anything else apart from being with them or preparing for their death. And w hen you are not with them you w ill be on red alert e very time the telephone goes. GYou may feel as if you are walking around in a bubble, unable to relate in your usual way to 'normal' life. Everyday conversations may seem trivial and irrelevant. You may find loud, busy or noisy places like supermarkets or restaurants hard to handle. GExplain clearly to your children and other fami ly members what you are going through. Additional stresses and strains can feel hard to bear. Tempers can easily fray. GGet someone to stock up the fridge and larder with ready-made meals and soups. You probably won't feel like cooking when you come home. But do make sure y ou have something hot and nourishing to eat every day. You need your health and strength. 40 GTell friends what is happening. Peopl e are amazing when they know they can be of support and help. It is comforting to have family friends sitting with the dying person. So, do offer friends the opportunity to come and say thei r farewells. Some will gladly do this. Others may not, preferring to remember the dy ing person as they were. GMake sure you have plenty of credits for your mobile telephone , and remember to charge it regularly. You will find yourself making and taking lots of calls from family and friends. In a hospital, this usually has to be done in an echoing corridor with trolleys and people clattering and rattling by. GIf required, make sure you have pl enty of change for the car park. Some machines only take coins. Be very careful when you are driving, as you will be preoccupied with what's going on. At the bedside of someone reaching the end of life It can be alarming to see the person y ou love attached to a s yringe-driver, monitors and a respirator. It can be hard too to be with someone who is semi-conscious, in physical or emotional distress, and who may be moaning or crying out. You may your self feel very anxious and helpless. You may also feel overwhelmed, vulner able and lonely, especially when nursing staff are busy with other patients. GMake sure you take plenty of breaks. I t can be hard to find a private place when things get tough, but there are often qui et rooms in hospices, and hospital chapels are usually open round the clock. GYou may feel guilty when you go home knowing you might never see the person again. That's normal. Just make sure when y ou leave you say your goodbyes. These farewells can mount up as the days go by. GMost hospitals, nursing homes and hospi ces will not provide food for relatives. Sandwiches, especially from hospital vending-mac hines can 41 be pretty dismal, and to keep your strength up you will need more than just snack food. So do consider bringing in your own food. Hospital caf\u00e9s can be closed at weekends, and local cafes may be closed on Sundays. GStaff are usually happy to give you coffee and tea as you sit by the bedside. But it might be an idea to bring in a thermos so you can have a drink at any time. Drinking plenty of fluids is very important, particularly as hospitals and hospices can be dry, hot environme nts. GIf you are in an open hospital ward, don't hesitate to pull the curtain round to get some privacy. Let the nursing staff know that's what you want to do. GBring in a comfortable pillow and blanket - especially if you are staying overnight. Hospital chairs have upright backs and are extremely uncomfortable after a couple of hours. If your relative is in a hospital side-room, you may be able to bring in a bed roll so you can sleep on the floor.But check with the nursing staff first. GDon't be afraid to knock on the hos pital Chaplain's door. They can also arrange for a priest, rabbi or ministers from other re ligions and denominations to come and talk to you, or to say end of life prayers with you and your dying relative or friend. They will often come in the evening, if appropriate, to say prayers with the dying person even when you may not be there. GLet the nursing staff get on w ith their job of providi ng nursing care. It is usually best to leave the room when they are w ashing and making the dying person comfortable. But don't be afraid to ask staff to provide extra mouth-care or turning, or to inform the m when your relative becomes distressed. GAbove all, don't be hard on your self. This is a very difficult and challenging time. Phone calls and visits quickly become part of your daily life, and the process can seem grindingly endless. But remembe r that in comparison to the dying person's life-span, their dying process is a short, precious time for you, and for them. 42 SUGGESTION FOR FRIENDS It is important for you to be able to s ay your goodbyes to your dying friend. Even so, for some families it can be difficult to accept friends being present during the dying process. Other families will be delighted and relieved to have you there. You may need to feel your w ay through this. Providing the right kind of suppor t to relatives of the dying is important, as well as being non-judgmental about how relative s and other friends may be emotionally affected by what is happening. It's little acts of kindness that count, and will be remembered. What to do: GCheck with the family if it's okay to say your goodbyes in person. You may want to do this on your own, or while family me mbers are present. Just let them know what you would prefer. GIf you are able to, offer to sit with your dying friend. This can be very comforting for families. Be sure you feel able to provide this support, as being with someone who is dying can be hard emotional work. GSend regular short texts or emails to relatives, without expectation of an answer. It is comforting for the family to know you are thinking of them. GOffer to baby-sit, cook meals for the family, or to fetc h and carry youngsters to and from school. You may be needed to take other relatives to seeing the dying person. GDon't take offence if you are not wanted! The offer of unconditional help is often enough. 43 SUMMARY It's okay to be afraid of facing the death of your relative or fri end. But the gift of being prepared to face it with them i s priceless. GRemember that hearing often continues to the e nd. GRemember just how awkward many people, and even medi cal professionals, still are with death. GYou may have to make difficult decisions about life-extending treatments. GTry as far as possible to make sure that the dy ing person is cared for in a quiet and loving environment. GBe aware that death can bring up unresolved family is sues that may have lain dormant for a long time. GBe willing to be open and recepti ve to your relative or friend wanting to talk about their dying process. If you feel you cannot do this, do talk to carers who can support you.What not to do: GDon't send Get Well cards when you know someon e is dying. It can be very upsetting for relatives to read them. GDon't expect relatives to spend hours on the phone talking to you. They will have enough to do caring for their dying relative. GDon't expect relatives to engage in conversations that do not revolve around the dying person, or the care they are getting. GDon't ask questions of a dying person who is too ill to respond. It can be stressful for them to try to communic ate with you. GDon't be falsely jolly. Be sensitive and be yourse lf. 44 GListen to what your friend or relative wants or needs, and try to ensure that those needs are met. GListen to what the dying person is describing during the last we eks and days of life, and be supporti ve to whatever is happening for them. It is their dying process. GHelp to create a sacred space as they enter their dying process - perhaps with gentle massage, or lighting candles, or playi ng beautiful music. GIf appropriate, be open to being there at the end, knowi ng this can be one of life's most enriching experiences. GYou may - or may not - experience strange phenome na around the time of death. GAfter being with someone who has died, be aware that you may feel strangely disconnected from reality for a period of time , and that you may find yourself asking questions about your own li fe. GIf at any time, and especially after several months, you fe el caught up with grief and unable to move forward, do seek help from a professional counsellor. And Finally... We hope this Guide may help you to face the challenges of being with relatives or friends as they journey from life into death. It is never an easy time, and there is always much to reflect upon. But, being present at the time of death can be a profoundly ric h and moving experience, on many levels. We wish you well with whatever you are dealing with, and hope you find peaceful acceptance within this extraordinary adventure. 45 THE ART OF DYING Peter Fenwick and Elizabeth Fenwick Continuum Books 2008 To order copies of this brochure, or to find out about workshops for carers, relatives and friends of the dying, please contact: Sue Brayne: sue@br aynework.com www .d-word.co.uk Peter Fenwick: www .horizonresearch.org Our grateful thanks Peter & Juliet Kindersley who supported, illustrated and produced this guide for carers with a generous grant from the Sheep Drove Trust.END-OF-LIFE EXPERIENCE S: A GUIDE FOR CARERS OF THE DYING 46 THE D-WORD: TalkingAbout Dying Sue Brayne Continuum Books 2010 www .d-word.co.uk www .continuumbooks.com peter_fenwick@compuserve.com SUGGESTED READING Death, Dying and B ereavement.
