I was glad to have the chance to attend. It was a beautiful service, with lots of memories shared. A real celebration of a life well-lived. Myself and my family have all been feeling sad, and I've been doing my best to take care of myself as well as them. Counting blessings The funeral reminded me of all the others I've attended. It's been over a decade since I attended the funerals of my mother, my aunt, my grandmother, and my nan. All four were significant women in my life and influenced me in many ways. I wrote about [my mother and my grandmothers](http://www.homeopathywithtracy.co.uk/blog/memories-mothers-day/) one Mother's Day. I still miss them. Funerals are always sad, but I was glad to have the chance to spend time with my friend and her family and friends. It also gave me time to reflect on what's important to me. Funerals always make me count my blessings.
