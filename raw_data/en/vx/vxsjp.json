It is this combination of the healing power of nature and scientific methods that support weakened or damaged systems and stimulate self-healing mechanisms making Naturopathic medicine an important system of health care today. Dr. Ananda works with you to identify and remove the cause of disease and establish healthy routines with nutritional and lifestyle counseling. Dr. Ananda believes the best way to heal the body is naturally without pharmaceuticals and uses alternative medicine like nutraceuticals, nutrition, genetics, intravenous therapy, botanicals, exercise and hormone replacement therapy to reverse and prevent disease using the fundamental healing principles of mind-body medicine. Because the principles of Naturopathic medicine are rooted in the body's ability to heal itself, Dr. Ananda treats most major health problems such as anxiety, depression, menopause, thyroid disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, auto-immune, fibromyalgia, adrenal and chronic fatigue, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, arthritis, diabetes, high cholesterol, etc. Dr. Ananda cares about your well being and will provide you with guidance, knowledge, and the tools needed to be healthy. Nutraceutical, also known as nutritional supplement, is the hybrid of 'nutrition' and 'pharmaceutical' and is a primary therapy in naturopathic medicine. Nutraceuticals are substances that play a significant role in modifying and maintaining physiological function. Nutraceutical therapy is customized to meet your specific health needs. Nutrition is one of the most crucial areas of health yet most people have no idea what they should eat. The link between good nutrition, healthy weight, reduced chronic disease risk, and overall health is too important to ignore. Learn how to eat to your metabolism and you'll be on your way to getting the nutrients your body needs to get healthy, active, and strong. Most common diseases are caused by a combination of genetic mutations, lifestyle choices, and your environment. People with similar genes may or may not get an illness depending on their lifestyle choices and environment. Optimize your treatment plan by learning how your genetic mutations may be affecting you and what you can do to combat them. Intravenous therapy is the fastest way to give your body the nutrition it needs. Because the nutrients go directly into your bloodstream, bypassing the digestive process, you get faster, more effective results.
