However, in this study, we demonstrated that class I HDAC inhibitors, such as Entinostat and Panobinostat, effectively suppressed tumor growth in immunocompetent but not immunodeficient mice. Further studies with Hdac1, 2, or 3 knockout tumor cells indicated that tumor-specific inactivation of HDAC3 suppressed tumor growth by activating antitumor immunity. Specifically, we found that HDAC3 could directly bind to promotor regions and inhibit the expression of CXCL9, 10, and 11 chemokines. Hdac3-deficient tumor cells expressed high levels of these chemokines, which suppressed tumor growth in immunocompetent mice by recruiting CXCR3+ T cells into the tumor microenvironment (TME). Furthermore, the inverse correlation between HDAC3 and CXCL10 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma tumor tissues also suggested HDAC3 might be involved in antitumor immune regulation and patient survival. Thus, our studies have illustrated that HDAC3 inhibition suppresses tumor growth by enhancing immune cell infiltration into the TME. This antitumor mechanism may be helpful in guiding HDAC3 inhibitor-based treatment. Introduction Histone deacetylases (HDAC) regulate target gene expression by removing acetyl groups from acetylated lysine residues of histone and nonhistone proteins. The HDAC superfamily comprises 18 members that are characterized into four classes: class I (HDACs1, 2, 3, and 8), class II (HDACs 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10), class III (sirtuin family, sirt1-sirt7), and class IV (HDAC11; refs. [1, 2](javascript:;)). Several studies have highlighted HDAC aberrant expression in certain cancer cells, and HDACs are considered as excellent targets for anticancer HDAC inhibitors, Vorinostat, Romidepsin, Panobinostat, and Belinostat, have been approved by the FDA for cancer therapy, and Tucidinostat also has been approved for clinical use in China. With scientific research and clinical trials continuously exploring new HDAC inhibitors that target specific HDAC proteins and are suitable for various cancers ( [3, 6, 7](javascript:;)), more research on the detailed functions of individual HDAC proteins on carcinogenesis and the mechanisms involved is needed. HDAC3 belongs to the class I HDACs, which were first identified as the components of the nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR) and silencing mediator of retinoic and thyroid receptors (SMRT) corepressor complexes ( [8](javascript:;)). Aberrant expression and/or the location of HDAC3 correlates with carcinogenesis, and selective HDAC3 inhibitors have been developed ( [9-11](javascript:;)). HDAC3 is involved in carcinogenesis by impacting cell-cycle progression or apoptosis of tumor cells, chromatin structure, and epigenetic modification or regulation of tumor-associated genes ( [12-16](javascript:;)). Deletion or inhibition of HDAC3 leads to impaired DNA repair, reduced chromatin compaction and heterochromatin content, and delay cell-cycle progression (H3K9ac)/trimethylation of H3K9 (H3K9me3) transition to regulate both DNA damage repair and transcription of many tumor-related genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; ref. [10](javascript:;)). BCL6/SMRT/HDAC3 complexes mediate aberrant transcriptional silencing of genes that regulate B-cell signaling and immune response in CREBBP-mutated B-cell lymphoma, and selective inhibition of HDAC3 is reported to be a novel for CREBBP-mutant lymphomas the expression of antitumor immunity-related genes, such as stimulator of interferon genes, PD-L1, and B7x ( [17-19](javascript:;)). These studies shed light on the critical role and complex participation of HDAC3 in carcinogenesis and antitumor immunity. HDAC3 affects different tumor types and cell lines, and the function of HDAC3 includes transcription regulation, metabolism regulation, or deacetylation modification. The involvement of HDAC3 in antitumor immunity has been extensively investigated, and the HDAC3-selective inhibitors are currently considered as a potential therapeutic strategy to combat various cancers ( [11, 20, 21](javascript:;)). However, the impact of HDAC3 proteins on T-cell recruitment, especially in the context of CXCL9, 10, 11/CXCR3 chemotaxis into the tumor microenvironment (TME), has not been investigated sufficiently. Infiltration of immune cells into the TME is controlled by chemokines, which are small proteins that induce chemotaxis, promote differentiation of immune cells, and cause tissue extravasation. They play an important role in antitumor immune responses in the TME ( [22-24](javascript:;)). The CXCL9, 10, 11/CXCR3 axis can lead to tumor suppression by regulating immune cell migration, differentiation, and activation ( [25-27](javascript:;)). CXCL9, 10, 11 are mainly secreted by monocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and cancer IFN [28, 29](javascript:;)). for which is preferentially expressed on the surface of monocytes, T cells, natural killer cells, dendritic cells (DC), and cancer cells ( [30](javascript:;)). The CXCL9, 10, 11/CXCR3 axis is involved in antitumor responses and promotes metastasis through paracrine and autocrine axes. The CXCL9, 10, 11/CXCR3 axis activates antitumor immune responses by regulating immune cell migration, differentiation, and activation (paracrine axis) ( [25](javascript:;)). Zhang and colleagues report that the combination of plasmid-borne CXCL9 plus cisplatin augments colon and activation ( [31](javascript:;)). Intratumoral CXCL9 and systemic IL2 reduces tumor growth and angiogenesis in a renal cell carcinoma tumor model through tumor-infiltrating CXCR3+ mononuclear cells. The benefit of CXCL10 overexpression to inhibit tumor growth has been reported in melanoma, sarcoma, and lung carcinoma models ( [25](javascript:;)). Although activation of the CXCL9, 10, 11/CXCR3 axis is a promising approach for cancer treatment, some reports show that suppression of this axis decreases tumor metastasis (autocrine axis), and treatment with the CXCR3 [32, 33](javascript:;)). These findings indicate the complex involvement of the CXCL9, 10, 11/CXCR3 axis in antitumor immunity. In this work, we found that HDAC inhibitors effectively suppressed tumor growth in C57BL/6 mice but not in nude mice. We also found that Hdac3/ tumors grew at much slower rates than Hdac3+/+ tumors in C57BL/6 mice, although they grew at similar rates in nude mice. These data demonstrated a novel role of HDAC3 in regulating the TME and antitumor immunity. Our mechanistic research revealed that HDAC3 suppressed Cxcl9, 10, 11 expression by directly binding to and deacetylating proteins near their promotor regions. Taking advantage of tissue microarray-IHC (TMA-IHC), we found that HDAC3 expression in HCC tissues showed a modest but significant inverse correlation with CXCL10 expression, CD8+ T-cell infiltration, and patient survival, indicating the possible regulatory relationship between HDAC3 and CXCL10 in the human TME. Thus, our work not only highlights the value of HDAC3 inhibition in cancer treatment, but also provides a novel TME regulating mechanism mediated by HDAC3.

Tumor tissues and clinical data Clinical sample collection and usage were approved by the Ethical Committee of the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University (Nantong, P.R. China) and written informed consent from the patients was obtained. This study recruited 129 human patients with HCC at the Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University (Nantong, P.R. China), including malignant HCC samples (n = 43) and benignant HCC samples (n = 86). Tumor tissues were collected from patients with surgical tumor excision, fixed with formalin (Sigma, catalog no. 104003), embedded with paraffin (Solarbio, catalog no. YA0012), stored at room temperature, and then examined by at least two independent pathologists. All the patients had not received chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy before their surgeries. The clinical information of all patients was collected in detail, including age, sex, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, liver cirrhosis, vascular invasion, tumor size, tumor differentiation, and tumor-node-metastasis stage. The study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethical Committee of the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University (Nantong, P.R. China). IHC measurement and analysis of TMA TMA-IHC was performed to measure the expression of HDAC3, CD8a, CXCL10, and CXCR3 in tissue blocks. The core tissue biopsies (2 mm in diameter) taken from individual paraffin-embedded sections were rearrayed in recipient paraffin blocks by using a TMA system (Quick-Ray, UT06, UNITMA; ref. [35](javascript:;)). Sections from arrayed blocks were sliced into 4 m and stained with a monoclonal rabbit anti-human HDAC3 (Cell Signaling Technology, ab8098; all antibodies used at the dilution of 1:100) at 4\u00b0C overnight, followed by incubation with a biotinylated secondary antibody (Abcam, catalog no. 64256) at room temperature for 30 minutes. HDAC3, CD8a, CXCL10, and CXCR3 scores were fluorescence-positive cells/CK staining cells\u00d7100 (0%-100%). The Vectra 3.0 Automated Quantitative Pathology Imaging System (PerkinElmer company) was used to accurately calculate cell counts of different HDAC3, CD8, CXCR3, and CXCL10 staining intensities in specific tissues. The expression of HDAC3 protein was graded by one two-grade scoring system, and we chose 50% as the cut-off point: a score of 0% to 50% was regarded as no or low expression, whereas 50% to 100% was regarded as high expression. Dataset analysis for OS To verify the prognostic value of Hdac1, 2, 3 genes, human datasets from a total of 876 patients with gastric cancer were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database ( [https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga)). The entire database incorporates 876 gastric cancer samples, gene expression data [published in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) as GSE22377, GSE14210, and GSE51105]. These patients were divided into different groups according to the expression of Hdac1, 2, 3 genes, with the best performing threshold to separate the low and high quartiles as the cutoff. OS rates were analyzed with a Kaplan-Meier plotter ( [https://kmplot.com/analysis/](https://kmplot.com/analysis/)).

Results HDAC inhibitors suppress tumor growth in an immune-dependent manner HDAC inhibitors have been extensively explored for cancer therapy. Among them, Panobinostat (also known as LBH589, a pan HDAC inhibitor) and Entinostat (also known as MS275, HDAC1 and 3 selective inhibitor) are under phase III clinical trials. We first checked the effect of Entinostat and Panobinostat on the growth of MC38 murine colon adenocarcinoma and MCA205 fibrosarcoma tumors. We found that Entinostat and Panobinostat effectively suppressed the growth of MC38 immunocompetent [Fig. 1E](javascript:;)- [H](javascript:;)). These results indicate that the class HDAC inhibitors Entinostat and Panobinostat inhibit MCA205 and immune-dependent manner. [Close modal](javascript:;) Hdac3 deficiency suppresses tumor growth, which is dependent on host immune responses Panobinostat and Entinostat both suppressed the growth of MCA205 and MC38 tumors, suggesting that inhibition of one or more class I HDACs may suppress tumor growth. To explore the role of Hdac1, 2, 3 genes on tumor growth, we knocked out Hdac1, 2, 3 genes in MC38 cells by CRISPR/Cas9 technology (Supplementary Fig. S1A-S1C) and injected the cells into C57BL/6 mice. Comparing the tumor growth of Hdac1/, Hdac2/, and Hdac3/ cells with their corresponding WT MC38 tumors, we found that Hdac3 deficiency significantly suppressed MC38 tumor growth, whereas Hdac1 and Hdac2 deficiency showed no obvious impact on the growth of MC38 tumors ( [Fig. 2A](javascript:;)). To confirm the involvement of the Hdac3 gene in tumor growth, we further knocked down (Hdac3+/) and knocked out (Hdac3/) the Hdac3 gene in MC38 and MCA205 cells. Comparing the tumor growth of Hdac3+/ and Hdac3/ MC38 and MCA205 tumors with their corresponding WT tumors in C57BL/6 and nude mice, we found that both Hdac3 knockdown and knockout prominently suppressed MC38 and MCA205 in C57BL/6 mice ( [Fig. mice [Fig. 2D](javascript:;) and [E](javascript:;)). These results indicate that HDAC3 promotes tumor growth and is dependent on host immune responses. [Close modal](javascript:;) After intravenous injection of MCA205 cells into the mice, tumors will develop and metastasize to multiple organs, leading to the death of mice. We then compared the survival rates of C57BL/6 mice intravenously injected with WT or Hdac3/ MCA205 cells. Mice xenografted with WT MCA205 cells did not survive beyond 17 days after transplantation, whereas all mice xenografted with Hdac3/ MCA205 cells survived ( [Fig. 2F](javascript:;)), suggesting Hdac3 deletion reduced metastasis and protected mice from metastasis-related death. We then also analyzed the correlation of Hdac1, 2, 3 gene expression with the OS of 876 patients with gastric cancer in GEO and TCGA databases. Higher expression of Hdac3 gene correlated with lower OS of gastric patients, whereas higher expression of Hdac1 and Hdac2 genes correlated with higher OS of gastric patients ( [Fig. 2G](javascript:;)- [I](javascript:;)). In addition, higher mRNA expression of HDAC3 was found in various cancers tissues compared with their corresponding normal tissues, including in cholangiocarcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma (Supplementary Fig. S2). These results suggest that specific inhibition of Hdac3 may suppress tumor growth through antitumor immunity. Enhanced local immune responses in Hdac3-deficient tumors CCK-8 (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B), Fig. and (Supplementary Fig. S3E and S3F) assays showed that Hdac3 deficiency had no impact on the viability and proliferation of MC38 and MCA205 cells. To explore whether HDAC3 played a role in regulating the local TME, we analyzed the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in WT and Hdac3+/ MCA205 tumors by flow cytometry because Hdac3/ cells did not form large enough tumors for flow cytometry analysis. Indeed, we observed increased [Fig. 3A](javascript:;); Fig. indicate that more antigen-presenting DCs and tumor-killing T cells are recruited into MCA205 TME when Hdac3 is deficient specifically in tumor cells. To better enumerate the magnitude and distribution of tumor-infiltrating T cells, immunofluorescence staining of WT, Hdac3+/, and and IFN+ cells S5B). were also performed to evaluate frequencies of OVA-specific IFN-secreting T cells in WT and Hdac3+/ MCA205 tumors stably expressing chicken OVA. The results showed that there were more IFN-secreting T cells in Hdac3+/ MCA205 tumors than that in WT tumors ( [Fig. 3D](javascript:;) and [E](javascript:;)). These results indicate that the quantity and characterization of tumor-infiltrating T cells in Hdac3-deficient tumors are significantly different from that in WT tumors. [Close modal](javascript:;) To characterize the signature of infiltrating T cells in TME, we isolated CD45+CD4+ and CD45+CD8+ T cells from WT and Hdac3+/ MCA205 tumors by FACS and performed bulk RNA-seq to detect gene expression. T cells isolated from Hdac3+/ tumors expressed higher levels of transcription factors such as Eomes and Tcf712; cell surface receptors such as Sell, Vsir, and Cd28; effector molecules such as Gzmb, than WT cells ( [Fig. 3F](javascript:;)). The results above suggest that specific Hdac3 deficiency in tumor cells triggers differential infiltration of immune cells and stronger local immune responses in TME than that in WT tumors. Hdac3 deficiency upregulates chemokine ( [Fig. 3F](javascript:;)) showed that HDAC3 may impact tumor growth by regulating infiltration and signature of immune cells (especially T cells) in TME. To explore the mechanism responsible for HDAC3 regulating T-cell infiltration and the TME, we performed RNA-seq with WT and Hdac3+/ MCA205 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotated classification analysis comparing differential expression between Hdac3+/ and WT tumors showed that Hdac3 deficiency significantly upregulated genes in the chemokine signaling pathway, T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction process ( [Fig. 4A](javascript:;) significantly enriched in Hdac3-deficient MCA205 tumors. These results suggest that TCR signaling and chemokine signaling pathways, in relation to T-cell recruitment, may contribute to the tumor growth suppression of Hdac3-deficient MCA205 cells. We then selected genes associated with T cells and T-cell recruitment and assessed their relative expression in WT and were significantly upregulated in Hdac3-deficient tumors ( [Fig. 4F](javascript:;)). To confirm the RNA-seq results, gene expression in Hdac3/ MCA205 tumors was compared with WT tumors via qRT-PCR. We confirmed that Hdac3 deficiency led to upregulated T-cell marker- and T-cell recruitment-related genes (Supplementary Fig. S5C). These results led us to hypothesize that HDAC3 may suppress T-cell recruitment into TME by reducing the expression of chemokines such as Cxcl9, 10, 11. Cxcl9, 10, 11 are IFN-inducible genes, and the IFN signaling pathway plays an important role in antitumor immune responses. We therefore quantitated the mRNA expression of Cxcl9, 10, showed that 10, 11 mRNAs were much higher in IFN-treated Hdac3/ cells than in WT cells ( [Fig. 5A](javascript:;)). Next, we quantitated the IFN-, IFN-treated WT and Hdac3/ MCA205 cell culture supernatants by ELISA. Similar to the mRNA expression, the protein concentrations of CXCL9, 10, 11 were also higher in Hdac3/ MCA205 cell culture supernatants than those from WT cells [Fig. 5B](javascript:;)). To confirm the upregulated expression Cxcl9, 10, 11 in Hdac3+/ MCA205 tumors in vivo, we measured the concentrations of CXCL9, 10, 11 in tumors tissues by ELISA and found CXCL9, 10, 11 in Hdac3+/ MCA205 tumors were also higher than that in WT MCA205 tumors ( [Fig. 5C](javascript:;)). These results indicate that Hdac3 deficiency upregulates the expression of Cxcl9, 10, 11 in tumor cells. [Close modal](javascript:;) To further confirm the role of deacetylation enzyme activity of HDAC3 on Cxcl9, 10, HDAC inhibitor cells and the mRNA expression of Cxcl9, 10, 11 were measured by qRT-PCR. The HDAC inhibitors Entinostat and RGF966 also 11 expression ( [Fig. 5D](javascript:;)). Correspondingly, we also detected upregulated expression of the CXCL9, 10, 11 receptor gene, Cxcr3, in Hdac3+/ MCA205 tumors [Fig. 5E](javascript:;)). that HDAC3 regulates Cxcl9, 10, 11 mRNA expression and is dependent on its deacetylation enzyme activity. HDAC3 directly binds and deacetylates the Cxcl10 gene promotor We next tried to explore the mechanism by which HDAC3 regulated the expression of Cxcl9, 10, 11. First, we compared the relative expression of Cxcl9, 10, 11 mRNA in IFN-, IFN-, and IFN-treated versus untreated MCA205 cells. The expression of Cxcl10 was higher than Cxcl9 and Cxcl11 in MCA205 cells (Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B), suggesting that CXCL10 is the main chemokine responsible for CXCR3+ T-cell recruitment in MCA205 tumors. HDAC3 is an epigenetic regulator that can mediate the deacetylation modification of histones. We next performed ChIP-seq and ChIP-qPCR assays to examine the enrichment Cxcl10 promotor region, and the H3K27ac levels were low in untreated and IFN-stimulated WT MCA205 cells. However, the enrichment of HDAC3 promotor was reduced in Hdac3+/ and Hdac3/ MCA205 cells, and the H3K27ac after IFN stimulation ( [Fig. 6A](javascript:;)- [D](javascript:;)). These results suggest that HDAC3 can bind to and suppress H3K27ac of the Cxcl10 promotor. To further determine the effects of the HDAC3 enzyme activity on Cxcl10 clone Fig. S7E and S7F) showed that Hdac3 overexpression had no impact on the viability and proliferation of MCA205 cells. Furthermore, ChIP-qPCR and ChIP-seq results showed that WT HDAC3 but not HDAC3 H134/135Q mutant could bind to the Cxcl10 cells reconstituted suppressed Cxcl10 mRNA WT, or H134/135Q-mutant HDAC3 in C57BL/6 and nude mice. Tumor growth monitoring showed that WT, but not H134/135Q mutant, HDAC3 rescued tumor growth in Hdac3/ cells in C57BL/6 mice, but not in nude mice ( [Fig. 6J](javascript:;) and [K](javascript:;)). These results suggest that gene expression Hdac3-deficient MCA205 tumor growth in an immune-dependent manner To further test the hypothesis that Hdac3 deficiency promoted the recruitment of CXCR3+ T cells to mediate antitumor immune responses, we used a CXCR3 antibody to block the CXCL9, 10, 11/CXCR3 chemokine signaling pathway in WT and Hdac3+/ MCA205 tumors. Although the TNF antibody and IgG had no effects on the slow growth of Hdac3+/ MCA205 tumors, CXCR3 antibody restored the growth of Hdac3+/ MCA205 tumors to a similar rate as WT MCA205 tumors ( [Fig. 7A](javascript:;)). CXCR3+, CD4+CXCR3+, and CD8+CXCR3+ infiltrating cells were MCA205 tumors after CXCR3 antibody decreased CD4+, in immunofluorescence staining of Hdac3+/ MCA205 tumors with CXCR3 ( [Fig. antibody-treated Hdac3+/ MCA205 tumors, which was likely due to reduced infiltration of Cxcr3-expressing T cells ( [Fig. 7E](javascript:;)). These results suggest that reduced growth of Hdac3-deficient tumors is likely due to enhanced antitumor activity mediated by CXCR3+ T cells infiltrating into the TME. Overall, our studies suggest HDAC3 is involved in antitumor immunity by regulating the expression of Cxcl9, 10, 11 genes and CXCL9, 10, 11-CXCR3 axis-mediated T-cell recruitment in into the right side of mice with WT MCA205 tumors on the left side for 7 days, we found that MTX-treated Hdac3+/ and Hdac3/ MCA205 cells inoculation on one side suppress the tumor growth of WT MCA205 tumors on the other side (Supplementary Fig. S8A and S8B), indicating that Hdac3-deficient MCA205 cells have distal antitumor activity in vivo. To determine the contribution of the CXCL10/CXCR3 axis in the antitumor activity of Hdac3/ side of mice xenografted with WT MCA205 tumors on the left side for 7 days, and then intravenously administrated these mice with CXCR3 antibody or IgG control. CXCR3 antibody restored MCA205 tumor growth (Supplementary Fig. S8C), suggesting that the antitumor activity of Hdac3 deficient cells in vivo is dependent on the CXCL10 and CXCR3 pathway. HDAC3 expression inversely correlates with CXCL10 in the TME of human HCC To validate the regulation relationship between HDAC3 and CXCL10 in human samples, we collected malignant (n = 86) and benign tissues (n = 41) of patients with HCC and performed TMA-IHC to evaluate the protein expression of HDAC3, CD8a, CXCL10, and CXCR3 (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). HDAC3 expression was elevated in cancerous tissues compared with benign tissues, whereas CXCL10 was lower in cancerous tissues than in benign tissues (Supplementary Fig. S9A and S9B). Furthermore, when the clinical outcomes of different subgroups classed by HDAC3 and CXCL10 levels were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier analysis, the results indicated that patients with HCC with higher HDAC3 or lower CXCL10 expression (cutoff = 50%) showed worse prognosis than patients with HCC with lower HDAC3 or higher CXCL10 expression (Supplementary Fig. S9C). To observe the relationship between HDAC3, CXCL10, CD8a, and CXCR3 in HCC samples, we then analyzed the correlation between HDAC3, CD8a, CXCL10, and CXCR3 levels. Protein levels of HDAC3 were modest but exhibited a significant inverse correlation with the expression of CD8a and CXCL10, and the expression of CD8a positively correlated with the protein levels of CXCR3 (Supplementary Fig. S9D). These results from clinical samples indicate that HDAC3 may regulate the expression of CXCL10 and further affect the infiltration of CD8+ T cells in TME of HCC. Discussion HDAC inhibitors have been increasingly used as therapeutic drugs to treat many kinds of cancers and other diseases. However, the mechanisms responsible for their chemotherapeutic actions are not fully understood. Commonly, HDAC inhibitors are thought to exert antitumor activity by causing cell-cycle arrest, inhibiting DNA repair, inducing apoptosis, and altering gene expression by acetylating non-histone proteins ( [4, 5, 24](javascript:;)). In this study, we found that class I HDAC inhibitors, Entinostat and Panobinostat, suppressed MCA205 and MC38 tumors in immunocompetent but not in immunodeficient nude mice, suggesting that they conduct antitumor activity in an immune-dependent manner. However, it is worth noting that the immune-dependent effects of HDAC inhibitors we observed may depend upon the specific cell lines we used and the experimental setting within our models. Some research shows that HDAC inhibitors suppress tumor growth in immunodeficient mice ( [36, 37](javascript:;)). This inconsistency with our results may result from different cell line usage and inhibitor administration (including dosages, times, and manners). The immune-dependent tumor suppression of HDAC inhibitors in this study may not represent the antitumor effects of other HDAC inhibitors and other tumor types. By comparing the tumor growth rates of Hdac1, 2, 3 knockout cells in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice and nude mice, we found HDAC3 was specifically involved in regulating antitumor immunity. Hdac3 deficiency resulted in significantly more cytotoxic and tumor-killing immune cells infiltrating into the TME than WT tumors, causing enhanced antitumor immune responses. Our studies therefore uncovered the function of HDAC3 in promoting tumor growth by suppressing tumor-killing immune cell infiltration into the TME. Immune cell infiltration into the TME influences tumorigenesis and clinical outcome. The CXCL9, 10, 11/CXCR3 axis regulates immune responses in TME by controlling immune cell recruitment and promoting Th1 polarization ( [25, 38](javascript:;)). The current work found more robust antitumor immune reactions in Hdac3-deficient tumors. More CTLs and CXCR3+ immune cells were distributed in Hdac3-deficient tumors because of upregulation of the CXCL9, 10, 11/CXCR3 axis. Because CXCR3 blocking antibody restored Hdac3+/ tumor growth to a similar rate as Hdac3+/+ tumors, we hypothesize that the growth inhibition of Hadc3+/ tumors was caused by increased expression of Cxcl9, 10, 11 chemokines and enhanced recruitment of CXCR3+ T cells into the TME, which is consistent with previous studies that indicate CXCL9, 10, 11/CXCR3 paracrine axis as a therapeutic target in cancer ( [39-41](javascript:;)). As a member of class I HDACs, HDAC3 protein is extensively expressed in various cell types and modifies different kinds of target proteins. HDAC3 interacts with NcoR1/2 and deacetylates histone and non-histone its deacetylation enzyme activity ( [8, 12, 42](javascript:;)). A recent study shows that HDAC3 activity in the gut is upregulated by microbiota-derived inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate to promote epithelial repair, indicating that HDAC3 acts as convergent epigenetic sensor of distinct metabolites that host responses to diverse microbial signals ( [43](javascript:;)). HDAC3 is also reported to be involve in carcinogenesis of various cancer types as an epigenetic and transcriptional regulator, and HDAC3 inhibitors are effective in the treatment of many cancers ( [4, 11, 44, 45](javascript:;)). HDAC3 possesses deacetylation activity-dependent activity-independent functions, which play different roles in physiologic processes. Nguyen and colleagues report selective enzymatic engagement of HDAC3 as a function of its differential association with NCoR1/2, selectively coordinated by either ATF3 or ATF2 during lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation in macrophages. Deletion of HDAC3 in macrophages safeguards mice from lethal exposure to LPS, but this protection is not conferred by genetic or pharmacologic abolition of HDAC3 enzyme activity, indicating the of HDAC3 whose noncanonical deacetylation-independent functions are vital for the innate immune system ( [46](javascript:;)). HDAC3 deletion in liver upregulates in severe hepatosteatosis ( Sun and colleagues hepatocytes causes histone hyperacetylation HDAC3 expression. deacetylation-dead HDAC3 mutants can rescue hepatosteatosis and repress lipogenic gene expression in HDAC3-depleted mouse liver, suggesting the deacetylation activity-independent role of HDAC3 in regulating gene transcription ( [49](javascript:;)). Here, we identified the deacetylation activity-dependent epigenetic modification role of HDAC3 on Cxcl10 gene is vital for MCA205 tumor growth. Successful transcription of specific genes involves the orchestrated effort of transcription factors and specific enzyme protein complexes that modify chromatin structure. HDAC3 regulated Cxcl10 gene expression by directly binding to and deacetylating the promotor of Cxcl10 gene. These results indicate that the deacetylase activity of HDAC3 is extremely important for its function in current study. Indeed, HDAC3 enzyme activity defective mutant HDAC3 H134/135Q can neither bind to Cxcl10 promotor nor deacetylate it. A previous report shows that H134/135 mutation leads to modest but significant reduction in most HDAC3-occupied chromatin sites ( [49](javascript:;)). HDAC3 binding to different gene promotors needs not only SMRT/NcoR, but also other may affect interaction of HDAC3 with other recruitment-related factors, which thus disable HDAC3 from binding to the promotor of the Cxcl10 gene. When the deacetylase activity of HDAC3 was mutated, it cannot bind to Cxcl10 promotor, suggesting that the deacetylase activity of HDAC3 is also engaged in the selection of chromatin sites or target proteins. By TMA-IHC staining, we also demonstrated the inverse correlation between HDAC3 and CXCL10 protein levels in human HCC, suggesting the possible regulation relationship between HDAC3 and CXCL10 in human tumors. However, no patients with HCC treated with HDAC3 inhibitors were recruited and compared in this study. Whether HDAC3 inhibition supports antitumor immunity in human patients still remains to be investigated. In summary, we have demonstrated that HDAC3 inhibition suppresses tumor growth by promoting Cxcl9, 10, 11 expression to recruit T-cell infiltration into TME. This work may help guide future cancer therapy by applying HDAC3-specific inhibitors in tumor cells. Authors' Disclosures No disclosures were reported. Authors' Contributions L.
