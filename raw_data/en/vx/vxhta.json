Students will obtain an in-depth understanding of how vaccines are produced by industry, undergo preclinical evaluation, and evaluated for efficacy in clinical trials. For public health programs, the global implementation of immunization programs will be covered, including measles eradication and how to best optimize population acceptability of vaccination. Course teaching will include a combination of didactic lectures, in-depth discussions on selected publications, and a final course research project individually developed by the student. Focus will be on global as well as domestic perspectives of vaccination for public health. Desired Course Outcomes: To understand differences in vaccines in terms of their production and their modes of prevention To gain an in-depth understanding of the array of public health disciplines related to vaccination To understand the basic underlying principles of vaccine immunology and approaches to evaluate the clinical impact of vaccination To learn to formulate research questions and lead a class discussion on a chosen article related to vaccination. To be able to formulate a research question and short proposal on vaccination using a randomized clinical trial design in order to address an important public health problem Class schedule: Week Date Class Topic Speaker Speaker Presentation and Q&A 3:35 - 5:00 PM Dr. Jennifer Smith will lead Class Discussion 5:20 - 6:35 PM 1 January 22 Overview of Vaccinology What is the ideal vaccine, is it an ideal disease to do a vaccine; why certain vaccines work -- to prevent infection, to prevent disease; herd protection, herd immunity David Weber UNC School of Medicine Epidemiology dweber@unch.unc.edu Each week, 1-2 student(s) will present one selected article of their choice which is related to the Class Topic, and lead the class discussion related to that article. Students will be assigned required articles for each class, and be expected to turn in their responses at the beginning of each class. During the class, students will be Syllabus: Spring 2017 Vaccine Epidemiology 2- Jennifer S. Smith, Ph.D., MPH divided into two break-out groups for discussion, with feedback to the larger group.

(ie. HIV, EBV, CMV, Ebola, vaccines; vaccines for non infectious diseases; targeting cancer; new delivery systems; adaptive trials; new adjuvants; new molecular methods for developing vaccines). Narendra Chirmule Senior Vice President, Head, Research and Development, Biocon Research Laboratories narendra.chirmule@biocon.com Course Format Lecture discussions by experts in key global health including group discussions and videos. Student's responsibilities include timely completion of assigned readings and coursework plus active participation in small group discussions and activities. We encourage asking questions during class and also connecting with guest speakers. A twenty minute break is assigned between guest lecture sessions; and the second session on concepts led by Dr. Smith and the student lead paper discussion, to allow for networking. Class Readings and Homework: Students will be assigned 3-4 readings (either manuscripts or book chapters) each week during the course of the semester. Required readings will be chosen each week in relation to the class topic. One time during the semester, each student will be responsible to choose an article that interests them and is related to their assigned class topic, and prepare a series of questions on their chosen article to be given to the class as homework following review and approval by Dr. Smith. Each week, the students will be responsible for independently preparing written answers to the assigned questions. Written answers should be emailed to the TA prior to the beginning of the class session. These will be evaluated only on the basis of completion (rather than content) and incorporated into your class participation grade. Unless otherwise indicated, all course readings and materials will be posted on the course Sakai site in the \"Course Documents\" section. For each student's article/questions presentation week: Class topics will be assigned before the first day of class (you will submit ranked preferences). Articles should be selected during the first week of class (these can be changed given enough prior notice). Syllabus: Spring 2017 Vaccine Epidemiology 4- Jennifer S. Smith, Ph.D., MPH A draft of your questions should be submitted for review two weeks prior to your class date. Please add this date to your calendars to send on time. The final version of your questions should be sent out a week before your class date. Final class project: Each student will design and present their own vaccine trial. Trials can be varying, depending upon students' interests (ie. Phase I, II, II or IV trials; behavioral intervention trial to increase vaccine uptake; comparison of two vaccines with immunological endpoints). This is intended to be a randomized controlled trial - approval is required for alternate trial designs. Ideally, the project will be related to each student's research interest, and students may obtain feedback on their ideas throughout the semester. Students will submit a 1-2 page draft proposal for their project on the day of their practice oral presentation. This project proposal should contain the following sections: 1) Background; 2) Specific Aims; 3) Methods. Some example project proposals will be circulated to students two weeks before this draft proposal is due. On student presentation day, students will present their developed final class project as an oral presentation to their fellow classmates and attending faculty for input and suggestions. A mock slide set will be given to students two weeks prior to their presentation as a presentation guide. The final research project should be submitted as a report on the final day of the class. The final project should include the following elements: 1-3 Key Specific Aims; study hypotheses; study justification; key methods (including both exposure and outcome definitions), laboratory methods if applicable; key trial activities; analysis section; sample size calculations; a simplified timeline; and rough budget estimate for planning purposes. The entire report should not exceed five pages.
