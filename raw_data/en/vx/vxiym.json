These protocols were developed for use by EM T-Basic trained and certified personnel. No person may provide any treatment they are not tr ained to provide AND that are not certified by the Department at the requir ed level of certification. The assessment information in the General Or ders is intended to be considered with all protocols. In addition, the General Medical Assessment should be considered with all medical protocols, the General Trauma Assessment should be considered wit h all trauma protocols, and the Pediatric Assessment should be cons idered with all pediatric protocols. These protocols are intended to: 1. Provide direction for the use of appropriate emergency medical care procedures, based on the Washington State EMT-Basic curriculum trai ning modules (identified on pages iii through v of the curriculum), to be used by EMT-Basi c certified personnel while working under the direction of the County M edical Program Director; 2. Provide for the standardization of pr ehospital care in Washington State; 3. Provide base hospital physicians and nurse s with an understanding of what aspects of patient care have been stressed to EMS personnel and what their treatment capabilities may be; 4. Provide EMS personnel with a framework for prehospital care and an anticipation of supportive orders from Medical Control; 5. Provide the basic framework on which Medi cal Control can conduct quality improvement programs. They are Unot U intended to: 1. Be a replacement for \" on-line\" medical control; 2. Be a teaching manual for EMS personnel. It is assumed that EMS personnel are appropriately trained and that each person will c ontinue to meet the state's continuing education requirements for recertification. It is further assumed that the County Medical Program Director will provide c ontinuing education based on the results of patient care audit and review; 3. Interfere with the wishes of the patient or family; Washington State EMT-Basic Field Protocols - Rev 9/05 vi Washington State EMT-Basic Field Protocols - Rev 9/05 1 GENERAL ORDERS I.

The \"obviously dead\" are victims who, in addition to absence of respiration and cardiac activity, have suffered one or more of the following: 1. Decapitation 2. Evisceration of the heart or brain 3. Incineration 4. Rigor Mortis 5. Decomposition B. Do Not Resuscitate orders and no pulse or respirations 1. DOA victims will be reported to the appropriate authorities based on local procedures. 2. DO NOT leave body unattended 3. Consider critical incident stress debr iefing for EMS personnel when involved with sudden, unexpected, accidental, traumatic and/ or unexplained deaths, particularly if children are involved. Washington State EMT-Basic Field Protocols - Rev 9/05 39DO NOT RESUSCITATE (DNR) ORDERS I. Scene Size-Up/Initial Patient Assessment II. Focused History and Detailed Physical Exam A. Determine the patient is in a Do Not Resu scitate status in one of the following ways: 1. The patient has an original, valid PO LST Form at the bedside, on the medicine cabinet, on the back of the bedroom door, or on the refrigerator, OR 2. The patient has an EMS-No CPR bracelet that is intact and not defaced. The bracelet can be located on either wrist, eit her ankle, or on a necklace or neck chain, and worn by the patient, OR 3. The patient has an original EMS-No CPR Form at the bedside, on the medicine cabinet, on the back of the bedroom door, or on the refrigerator. 4. The patient has other DNR Orders: We encourage medical facilities to use the POLST Form. a) Sometimes health care facilities prefer to use their own health care DNR orders. When encountering other DNR order s, perform the following: (1) Verify that the order has a physician signature requesting \"Do Not Resuscitate.\" (2) Verify the presence of t he patient's name on the order. b) Contact on-line medical control for further consultation. In most cases, on-line medical control will advise to withhold CPR following verification of a valid physician-signed DNR order. 5. In extended or intermediate care facilitie s, look for the DNR form in the patient's chart. III. Management A. Begin resuscitation when it is determined: 1. No valid DNR order exists. 2. In your medical judgment, your patient has attempted suicide or is a victim of a violence B. Do Not initiate resuscitation measures when: 1. The patient is determined to be \"obviously dead\". a) The \"obviously dead\" are victims who, in addition to absence of respiration and cardiac activity, have suffered one or more of the following: (1) Decapitation (2) Evisceration of heart or brain (3) Incineration (4) Rigor Mortis (5) Decomposition C. When the patient has an existing, valid DNR order: 1. POLST: a) Provide resuscitation based on patient's wishes identified on the form b) Provide medical interventions identified on the form c) Always provide comfort care Washington State EMT-Basic Field Protocols - Rev 9/05 40 2. EMS-No CPR: a) Do not begin resuscitation measures b) Provide comfort care c) Contact patient's physician or on-line medi cal control if directed by local protocols or if questions or problems arise. 3. Other DNR orders: a) Follow specific orders contained in the DNR order based on the standard of care allowed by your level of certificat ion/licensure and communications with on-line medical control. 4. Remember - Do Not Resuscitate does not mean Do Not provide comfort care when necessary. D. If resuscitative efforts have been started before learning of a valid DNR order, STOP these treatment measures unless conti nuation is requested by the DNR order and provide comfort care: 1. Basic CPR. 2. Intubation (leave the endotracheal tube in place, but stop any positive pressure ventilations). 3. Cardiac monitoring and defibrillation. 4. Administration of resuscitation medications. 5. Any positive pressure ventilation (through bag valve masks, pocket face masks, endotracheal tubes). E. Revoking the DNR order. The following people can inform the EMS system that the DNR order has been revoked: 1. The patient (by destroying the order, dra wing a diagonal line or the word VOID across the front of the form, or by verbally revoking the order). 2. The physician expressing the patient 's revocation of the directive. 3. The legal surrogate for the patient expressing the patient's revocation of the directive. (The surrogate cannot verbally revoke a patient executed directive). F. Documentation 1. Complete the Medical Incident Report (MI R) form approved by your Medical Program Director. 2. State in writing in the upper left hand corner of the narrative summary: b) \"Patient identified as DNR by POLST, EMS-No CPR, or Other 3. Record the name of the patient's physi cian, and state whether you contacted the physician. 4. Record the reason why t he EMS system was activated. 5. Comfort the family and byst anders when patients have expired 6. Follow your local Medical Program Director' s protocols for patients who have expired. Actions may include contact of the local co roner's office, the local law enforcement agency, the local chaplain service, or f uneral home. The MIR form must still be completed. T Washington State EMT-Basic Field Protocols - Rev 9/05 41 G. Comfort Care Measures - Providing comf ort care is an important responsibility and service you provide to patients and their fam ilies at a crucial moment in their lives. 1. Comfort care measures for the dying patient may include: a) Manually open the airway (do not provi de positive pressure ventilation with a bag valve mask, pocket mask or endotracheal tube). b) Clear the airway (including stoma) of secretions with appropriate suction device. c) Provide oxygen per nasal cannula at 2-4 l/min. d) Positioning for comfort. e) Splinting. f) Controlling bleeding. g) Providing pain medications pertinent to the level of cert ification/licensure. h) Providing emotional support. i) Provide emotional support to the family. 2. Contact patient's physician or on-line medical control if directed by local protocols or if questions or problems arise. H. Special situation: 1. The patient's wishes in regard to resuscitation should always be respected. Sometimes, however, the family may vigorous ly and persistently insist on CPR even if a valid DNR order is located. These ve rbal requests are not consistent with the patient's directive. However, in such circumstances: a) Attempt to convince family to honor the patient's decision to withhold CPR/treatment. If family persists, then b) Initiate resuscitation efforts until relie ved by paramedics (for First Responders and EMTs). c) Advanced life support personnel should c ontinue treatment and consult medical control. I. Remember: - Once a death has occurred, the family and relatives become your patients. IV. Ongoing Assessment as appropriate V.

One rescuer applies in-line st abilization by placing his or her hands on each side of the helmet with the fingers on the victim's mandible. This position prevents slippage if the strap loosens. 2. The rescuer cuts or loosens the straps or the D-rings while maintaining in-line stabilization. 3. A second rescuer places one hand on the mandible, at the angle, with the thumbs on one side and the long and index fingers on the other. With the other hand, the second rescuer also applies pressure from the occipital region. This maneuver transfers the in-line stabilization responsibility to the second rescuer. 4. The rescuer at the top removes the helmet, considering these three factors: A. The helmet is egg shaped and must be expanded laterally to clear the ears, B. Glasses must be removed prior to helmet removal, C. If the helmet provides full facial coverage, it must be raised over the nose and moved backwards. 5. The second rescuer must maintain in-line stabilization from below in order to prevent head tilt. 6. After the helmet is removed, the rescuer at the top places his or her hands on either si de of the victim's head with the palms over the ears. 7. In-line stabilization is maintained from above until a backboard and cervical collar are securely in place.

This procedure has been developed by the Prehospital Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), endorsed by the Governor's EMS and Tr auma Care Steering Committee, and in accordance with RCW 70.168 and WAC 246-976 adopted by the Department of Health (DOH). The procedure is described in the schematic with narrative. Its purpose is to provide t he prehospital provider with quick identification of a major trauma vict im. If the patient is a major trauma pat ient, that patient or patients must be taken to the highest level trauma facility within 30 minutes transport time, by either ground or air. To determine whether an injury is major trauma, the prehospital provi der shall conduct the patient assessment process according to the trauma triage procedures. Explanation of Process A. Any certified EMS and Trauma person can identify a major trauma patient and activate the trauma system. This may include requesting more advanced prehospital services or aero-medical evacuation. B. The first step (1) is to assess the vital signs and level of consciousness. The words \"Altered mental status\" mean anyone with an altered neurologic exam ranging from completely unconscious, to someone who responds to painful stimuli only, or a verbal response wh ich is confused, or an abnormal motor response. C. The \"and/or\" conditions in Step 1 mean that any one of the entities list ed in Step 1 can activate the trauma system. D. Also, the asterisk (*) means that if the airway is in jeopardy and t he on-scene person cannot effectively manage the airway, the patient should be taken to the nearest medi cal facility or consider meeting up with an ALS unit. These factors are true regardless of the assessment of other vital signs and level of consciousness. E. The second step (2) is to assess the anatomy of injury. The specific injuries noted require activation of the trauma system. Even in the assessment of normal vital signs or normal levels of consciousness, the presence of any of the specific anatomical injuries does require activation of the trauma system. F. Please note that steps 1 and 2 also require notifying Medical Control. G. The third step (3) for the prehospital provider is to assess the biomechanics of the injury and address other risk factors. The conditions identified are reas ons for the provider to contact, and consult with, Medical Control regarding the need to activate the system. They do not automatically require sy stem activation by the prehospital provider. H. Other risk factors, coupled with a \" gut feeling\" of severe injury, means that Medical Control should be consulted and consideration given to transporting the patient to the nearest trauma facility. I. Please note that certain burn patient s (in addition to those listed in Step 2) should be considered for immediate transport or referral to a burn center/unit. Patient Care Procedures To the right of the attached schematic you will find t he words \"according to DOH-approved regional patient care procedures. \"These procedures are developed by the regi onal EMS and Trauma council in conjunction with local councils. They are intended to further def ine how the system is to operate. T hey identify the level of medical care personnel who participate in the system, t heir roles in the system, and participation of hospital facilities in the system. They also address the issue of inter-hospital transfer, by transfer agreements for identificat ion, and transfer of critical care patients. In summary, the Prehospital Trauma Triage Procedure and t he Regional Patient Care Procedures are intended to work in a \"hand in glove\" fashion to effectively address EMS and Trauma patient care needs. By functioning in this manner, these two instruments can effect ively reduce morbidity and mortality. If you have any questions on the use of either instrument, y ou should bring them to the attention of your local or regional EMS and Trauma counc il or contact 1-800-458-5281. 1994/Disc 1/triage.exp Washington State EMT-Basic Field Protocols - Rev 9/05 53STATE OF WASHINGTON PREHOSPITAL TRAUMA TRIAGE (DESTINATION) PROCEDURES Prehospital triage is based on the following 3 steps: Step s 1 and 2 require prehospital EMS personnel to notify medical control and activate the Trauma System.

[1998 c 328 \u00a7 5 ...] \"The legislature finds that including certain department of corrections personnel among the professionals who are mandated to report suspected abuse or neglect of children, dependent adults, or, people with developmental disabilities is an important step towards improving the protection of these vulnerable populations. The legislature intends, however to limit the circumstances under which department of corr ections personnel are mandated reporters of suspected abuse or neglect to only those ci rcumstances when the information is obtained during the course of their employment. This act is not to be construed to alter the circumstances under which other professional are mandated to report suspected abuse or neglect, nor is it he legislature's intent to alter current practices and procedures utilized by other professional organizations who are ma ndated reporters under RCW 26.44.030(1)(a).\" [1996 c 278 Washington State legisl ature finds and declares: The children of the state of Washington are th e state's greatest resource and the greatest source of wealth to the State of Washington. Ch ildren of all ages must be protected from child abuse. Governmental authorities must give the prevention, treatment, and punishment of child abuse the highest priority, and all inst ances of child abuse must be reported to the proper authorities who should diligently and exped itiously take appropriate action, and child abusers must be held accountable to the people of the state for their actions. The legislature recognizes the current heavy casel oad of government authorities responsible for the prevention, treatment, and punishment of child abuse. The information obtained by child abuse reporting requirements, in addition to its use as a law enforcement tool, will be used to determine the need for additional fundi ng to ensure that resources for appropriate governmental response to child abuse are available.

Remove blood, other liquids and food particles from the airway. B. Some suction units are inadequate for removing solid objects like teeth, foreign bodies and food. C. A patient needs to be suctioned immediately when a gurgling sound is heard with artificial ventilation. II. Types of equipment A. Suction devices 1. Mounted 2. Portable a) Electrical b) Hand operated B. Suction catheters 1. Hard or rigid (\"Yankauer,\" \"tonsil tip\") a) Used to suction the mouth and oropharynx of an unresponsive patient. b) Should be inserted only as far as you can see. c) Use rigid catheter for infants and children, but take caution not to touch back of airway. 2. Soft (French) a) Useful for suctioning the nasopharynx and in other situations where a rigid catheter cannot be used. b) Should be measured so that it is inse rted only as far as the base of the tongue. III. Techniques of use A. Suction device should be inspected on a r egular basis before it is needed. A properly functioning unit with a gauge should generate 300 mm Hg vacuum. A battery-operated unit should have a charged battery. B. Turn on the suction unit. C. Attach a catheter. 1. Use rigid catheter when sucti oning mouth of an infant or child. 2. Often will need to suction nasal passages; should use a bulb suction or French catheter with low to medium suction. D. Maintain body substance isolation E. Use with extreme caution in patients with epiglottitis. F. Insert the catheter: 1. Into the oral cavity without suction, if possi ble. Insert only to the base of the tongue. 2. Into the stoma or trach tube a) Use French catheter b) Measure length of catheter for insertion to length of little finger (approximately 3 inches) c) Suction Washington State EMT-Basic Field Protocols - Rev 9/05 61 G. Apply suction. Move the catheter tip side to side. H. Suction airway until clear, and observe for bradyca rdia in children. Suction for no more than 15 seconds at a time. (15 seconds is the maxi mum recommended suction duration per insertion.) 1. In infants and children, shorter suction time should be used. 2. If the patient has secretions or emesis that cannot be removed quickly and easily by suctioning, the patient should be log ro lled and the oropharynx should be cleared. 3. If patient produces frothy secretions as r apidly as suctioning can remove, suction for 15 seconds, artificially ventilate for two minut es, then suction for 15 seconds, and continue in that manner. Consult medical di rection for this situation. I. If necessary, rinse the catheter and tubing with wa ter to prevent obstruction of the tubing from dried material.
