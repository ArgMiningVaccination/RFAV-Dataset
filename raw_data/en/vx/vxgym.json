Complementary medicines are used in conjunction with conventional medicine while alternative medi cines are used instead of conventional medicine. One form of CAM is h omoeopathy , which uses highly diluted preparations that are thought to stimulate the bodys own healing response to prevent and/or treat a wide range of illnesses. Some people consider homoeopathy (also spelt homeopathy ) for their childs immunisation rather than conventional vaccination . However, unlike conventional vaccinations, there has been no rigorously tested research to demonstrate the safety or effectiveness of homoeopathic prep arations in provid ing protection against childhood infectious diseases. In addition, there is no biological ly plausible mechanism for how hom oeopathy could work to prevent infectious diseases. This fact sheet aims to discuss this issue further by answering these commonly asked questions: What is homoeopathy? Is homoeopath y an alternative to conventional immunisation? How effective is homoeopath y in preventing infectio us diseases? Which is safer, homoeopathic preparations or conventional medicine, for immunising my child? What do homoeopathic organisations recommend? Can homoeopathic pre parations be given to lessen the possible side effects of conventional vaccination ? What is homoeopathy? Samuel Hahnemann (1755 -1843), a German physician and chemist, was the founder of homoeopathy. The fundamental principle behind homoeopathy is that like cures like .1 Homoeopathic preparations in general are made using the processes known as potentiation and succussion meaning that the disease, tissue or plant extract (known as the nosode) is diluted in water a number of times with vigorous shaking between each dilution , to the point where none of the original material is contained within the preparation by the end of the process. It is believed that t he process of succussion transfer s the protective activity of the nosode into the diluting water. However , due to the extensive dilution of th e nosode, it is unlikely that the final hom oeopathic preparation contains a single molecule of the original material . While the amount of dilution can vary, the most common dilution factor is 1060, which means the original material has been diluted many bi llions of times. Many of the schedules to administer homoeopathy are complex , extend over a period of years with multiple doses and involve a significant financial cos t, without any evidence of efficacy. Several homoeopathic preparations are available and come in differing strengths and constituents. Each homoeopathic practitioner has a different approach to their preparations, and there is no centralised body to regulate the practice of homoeopathy in Australia. In general , homoeopathic preparations do no t undergo the rigorous testing for safety and efficacy by the Therapeutic Goods Administration that other drugs do. Is homoeopath y an alternative to conventional immunisation? No. Although homoeopathic preparations and schedules have been developed claimi ng to prevent childhood infectious diseases such as pertussis (whooping cough), tetanus, diphtheria, measles, mumps and rubella (German measles), homoeopathic peak organisations still support the need for children to be vaccinated conventionally2,3 (also see What do homoeopathic organisations recommend? ) Homoeopathic preparations use nosodes , which are diluted to such an extent that no trace of the orig inal nosode remains . Unlike immunisation using conventional vaccines, there is no reliable evidence to support the claimed protective effect of homoeopathic immunisation (see How effective is homoeopath y in preventing infectious disease ). Hom oeopathic immunisation is not recognised for family tax benefits or rebates li nked to immunisation status and does not fulfil any childcare or school entry vaccination requirements in Australia . Homoeopathy and vaccination | NCIRS Fact sheet: April 2014 2 How effective is homoeopath y in preventing infectious diseas es? Some homoeopathic preparations for the treatment of certain health problems, such as childhood diarrhoea and hay fever, have been scientifically tested . However , no well-designed, well -reported and high quality research can be found that demonstrate s the effectiveness of homoeopathic immunisations for prevention or treatment of vaccine preventable diseases without a significant risk of bias.1,4,5 This is in contrast to conventional immunisations which have been rigorously tested , and for which there are large amounts of high quality clinical and epidemiol ogical data to support their efficacy in the prevention of certain childhood infectious diseases. There are few studies in the publis hed peer -reviewed literature that investigate the effectiveness of homoeopathic immunisation . A recent Cochrane Intervent ion Review aimed to determine the efficacy of the hom oeopathic preparation Oscillococcinum\u00ae in the prevention of influenza. This review reported no statistically significant difference between the effects of hom oeopathic preparation and placebo in the prev ention of influenza -like illness.6 The review also reported that the overall standard of reporting in the included studies was poor and contained unclear risk of bias. An ecological study has been published applying homoeopathic immunisation to Leptospirosis epidemic control. A decrease in the disease was observed in a community who received the homoeopathic intervention , but due to the nature of ecological study design , which is inferior to other epidemiological study designs, whether this decrease is due to the intervention or other factors could not be established . The authors concluded that their study did not provide evidence to support the replacement of conventional disease prevention strategies with homoeopathic immunisation.7 There are other studies published in various forms (though not peer -reviewed ) which suggest homoeo pathic preparations may provide protection against infectious diseases . However , they are of poor scientific quality , contain small sample sizes and provide limited scientific evidence . Which is safer, homoeopathic preparations or conve ntional medicine , for immunising my child? Conventional medicines such as vaccines are thoroughly scrutinised, tested, evaluated and followed up for their safety and effectiveness. Homoeopathic preparations are not subjected to the same level of attention. Many homoeopathic preparations have not undergone testing or approval through government regulatory bodies, such as the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration or the United States Food and Drug Administration, which is standard practice for conventio nal vaccines. What do homoeo pathic organisations recommend? Both the British Homeopathic Association and the Australian Register of Homoeopaths recommend that people should receive conventional immunisation and that homoeopathic preparations \"should not b e recommended as a substitute for [conventional] immunisation\". Anecdotally, however, this is not the belief of all homoeopaths.8,9 The Australian Hom oeopathic Association has strict guidelines in place regarding the use of hom oeopathic immunisation , including a compulsory consent form stating the treatment is not an immunisation, that no prophylactic treatmen t guarantees immunity from infectious disease , and that the evidence for the efficacy of hom oeopathic immunisation is limited. Can homoeopathic preparations be given to lessen the possible side effects of conventional vaccination ? Conventional vaccinati on may cause minor side effects such as redness, swelling and pain at the injection site , which in most cases can be easily treated with paracetamol and other comfort measures . More serious side effects are rare. For further information refer to the 10th edition of The Australian Immunisation Handbook .10 There is no scientific evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of homoeopathic remedies in preventing or lessening vaccine side effects.
