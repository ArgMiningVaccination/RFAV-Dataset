We will continue to evolve our safety protocols consistent with CDC guidelines, as well as those of our state and local public health agencies. We appreciate your support and understanding as Silver Lining Acupuncture continues to prioritize community safety. Masks are currently required in healthcare settings. Beginning Monday, April 3rd, 2023, patients, visitors, and workers in healthcare settings will no longer be required by the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) to mask. This decision was made by OHA based on declining numbers of recorded cases of COVID throughout the state. In accordance with OHA, Silver Lining Acupuncture is lifting its mask requirements effective April 3, 2023. The CDC and OHA continue to strongly recommend that individuals who are immunocompromised or live with those who are immunocompromised continue to wear masks. We support those who may choose to wear a mask and will continue to keep masks available in the office should you request one. If you would like your provider to mask during your visit, please let us know when scheduling your appointment or when you arrive and we will be happy to do so. We also ask that if you are experiencing any COVID-like symptoms or if you are recovering from COVID, please let us know and we will advise you on when you can return to in-person visits. It is important to note that the safety measures and state laws we must follow do not consider whether you are vaccinated. In other words, we strictly adhere to all safety protocols regardless of vaccination status. Informed Consent: You are the decision maker for your health care. Part of this office's role is to provide you with information to assist you in making informed choices. This process is often referred to as \"informed consent\" and requires your understanding and agreement regarding recommended care, and the benefits and risks associated with the provisions of health care during a pandemic. After booking, you will be provided with a [COVID-19 Informed Consent Form](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yprv54ftt4pxzh4/COVID-19%20Informed%20Consent%20Form%20-%202020-05-08.pdf?dl=0) that you will be required to read and sign before receiving treatment. If you do not feel comfortable with the potential risks involved and are unable to provide consent, your appointment will be cancelled. You may rebook at any time should you change your mind. Cancellations: If your appointment is cancelled due to sudden onset of fever 99.6 or higher, suspected COVID-19 symptoms including *Fever *Shortness of Breath *Dry Cough *Runny Nose *Sore Throat *Loss of Taste or Smell *Diarrhea or *Vomiting in the past 24 hours, or any respiratory-related symptoms, our customary $50 late cancellation fee will be waived. Please do your best to notify us as soon as possible so we can make adjustments to the schedule. TREATMENT ROOM SAFETY Practitioner Hygiene Practices: Providers will wash their hands and/or sanitize between patients and before and after each time they enter the treatment room. Treatment Table: Sheets will be changed between each patient. Upon removal of sheets, the surface of the table will be disinfected before clean sheets are put on. Our tables and pillows have water-resistant coverings on them, which allows us to spray them down with disinfectant. Treatment Room: The treatment room will be cleaned and aired out for 15 minutes between patient appointments. Air Scrubber: HEPA air scrubber filters with UV lights will be running in your treatment room during your appointment. This system removes bacteria, viruses, mold etc. to prevent airborne pathogens from recirculating. UV Light: High intensity UV lightbulbs will be used in treatment rooms after closing for the day to eradicate up to 99% of bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. Surface Sanitization Practices - Patient Areas: In addition to treatment tables, all therapeutic equipment, counter tops, chairs, door handles, clipboards, and garment hooks will be disinfected prior to and following each treatment.
