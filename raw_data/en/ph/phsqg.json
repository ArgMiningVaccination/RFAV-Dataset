The a mended Directive 2 comes with several conditions that members must meet before they resume their in -person practice, including the requirements set out in COVID -19 Operational Requirements: Health Sector Restart (May 26, 2020 or as current). In preparation for the return to non -essential services, the College of Traditional Chinese M edicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Ontario (the College) has developed a guideline to provide members with a return to practice protocol focused on infection prevention and control. The aim is to protect patients, practitioners, and those around them. Although members may be able to return to practice, the risk to the public posed by COVID -19 has not disappeared . Members will want to take extra precautions to ensure the risk of trans mission in their practice is kept to a minimum. As regulated health professionals, members are required to review and follow the directives and guidance from the Ministry of Health, Public Health Ontario, the Chief Medical Officer of Health and other aut horitative bodies regarding practices during COVID -19. In addition, members are expected to prioritize the safety of their patients, staff, colleagues and others visiting their practice. College publications, including this document, provide authoritative guidance on how to achieve this overarching duty. Of course, TCM practitioners and acupuncturists are expected to use professional judgment. Some of the guidance may not apply in some circumstances and in other circumstances the guidance may be insufficien t to meet your duty of safety. To the extent that directives and guidance from the Ministry of Health, Public Health Ontario, the Chief Medical Officer of Health and other authoritative bodies regarding practices during COVID -19 and this guidance document differ, TCM practit ioners and acupuncturists should apply the higher standard. Review of this document is ongoing and the information will be amended as necessary. Key points: Effective infection prevention and control (IP AC) is essential for the delivery of safe care. Practitioners must be aware of current infection control standards and expectations and implement procedures in the context of their practice setting. As regulated health professionals, members of the College are required to review and follow the recommendations from the Ministry of Health, Public Health Ontario, the Chief Medical Officer of Health and other authoritative bodies regarding practices durin g COVID -19. Members are also required to use appropriate clinical judgment and follow the Standards of Practice of the profession . TCM and acupuncture services should only be provided when the anticipated benefits of treatment outweigh the risks to the patient and the practitioner. For up-to-date information on COVID -19, including updated case definition, please visit the Ministry of Health website. COVID -19: Return to Practice Guidance - Version Date: August 8 , 2020 Page 3 1. Infection, Prevention, and Control (IPAC) Strategy This section provides information that practitioners and their staff should review before the reopening of clinics to ensure that their practice settings are safe for patients, practitioners, and clinic staff. Routine IPAC practices assume that all patients /contacts are potentially sources of infection, even if a person shows no signs of symptoms or illness . Hand Hygiene Hand hygiene is recognized as the most important infection control and prevention measure. This is particularly important in a TCM or acupuncture setting. In addition to conducti ng proper hand hygiene, p ractitioners should also promote proper hand hygiene for staff and patients. Hand washing should be performed : With soap and water, or by using an alcohol- based hand sanitizer (greater than 70% alcohol content). Before and after patient contact or acupuncture treatment; Before and after preparing, handling, or dispensing herbs or herbal remedies; When hands are contaminated during the treatment ; Immediately after inadvertent exposure to blood or body fluids; When hands are visibly soiled; After contact with environmental surfaces (e.g., treatment tables, carts ) or equipment; After removing gloves; Before preparing, handling, serving or eating food; After handling money or other items that may be contaminated; After answering the phone or using the computer or other electronic devices and returning to a patient; and After personal body functions . For more information about hand washing pr ocedures, please see the Safety Program Handbook . Public Health Ontario has useful posters that can be used to educate clinic staff and patients regarding proper hand washing and hand sanitizing: Public Hea lth Ontario COVID -19 Factsheet Respiratory Etiquette The following measures are part of proper respiratory etiquette . Cover the nose/mouth when coughing or sneezing. Wear a surgical, procedure , or medical mask to protect other s. Use tissues to contain respirat ory secretions and dispose of them in the nearest waste receptacle after use. Perform hand hygiene ( see above ) after having contact with respiratory secretions and contaminated objects/materials. COVID -19: Return to Practice Guidance - Version Date: August 8 , 2020 Page 4 The following posters from Public Health Ontario and Ottawa Public Health can be useful in a TCM practice setting: Public Health Ontario \"Cover Your Cough\" Ottawa Public Health Cough Etiquette Ottawa Public Health (Posters in multiple languages) Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Strategy This is based on the assumptions that patients have been pre -screened and do not exhibit any signs or s ymptoms of COVID -19. The Ministry's COVID -19 Operational Requirements: Health Sector Restart must be adhered to. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is an essential element in preventing the transmission of disease -causing microorganisms. If used incorrectly , it will fail to prevent transmission and may facilitate the spread of disease. Practitioners need to use PPE to protect themselves from potential infections. PPE can also protect the patient by preventing the practitioner from becoming the agent of transmission of infectious organism from patient -to-patient. Examples of PPE include single use gloves, gowns, facia l protection (including surgical, procedure , or medical masks and N95 respirators) and/or eye protection (including safety glasses, face shields or masks with visor attachments). Key Points : TCM and acupuncture services are not recommended, i f sufficient supply of PPE is unavailable . Practitioners should ensure that they and their staff understand the safe use, care and limitations of PPE. For the recommended steps for putting on and taking off PPE as well as proper disposal, please see Public Health Ontario - Recommended Steps . Practitioners are required to wear a surgical , procedure , or medical masks during treatments and whenever two meters (social distancing) cannot be in effect. For more information, please see the COVID -19 medical masks and N95 respirators: Overview . Where possible, practitioners should be using surgical , procedure , or medical masks that fall within one of the three classifications indicated . Masks should be changed as frequently as required. We have set out some guiding principles on this below. Members are not required to change masks (between patients) unless any of the following apply: o The mask becomes visibly soiled; o The mask makes contact with another person or their droplets or secretions (i.e. is coughed on); o The mask becomes damaged or compromised in any way; or o The mask becomes very moist to the point that the integrity becomes compromised. COVID -19: Return to Practice Guidance - Version Date: August 8 , 2020 Page 5 As outlined in the Ministry of Health Operational Requirements , members must require all patients wear masks when arriving for, or receiving treatment ( including while patients are in a designated waiting area or room), as it becomes more difficult to maintain social distancing. Members should advise patients in advance (for example, at the time of booking an appointment ), of the r equirement to wear a mask when attending for treatment. Advise them that this is for the protection of the practitioner and the patient themselves. If the patient arrives without a mask, the member can provide a disposable mask for t he patient to wear. If the patient cannot wear a mask (e.g., due to a medical condition or perhaps have difficulty breathing) members may ask if the patient would be comfortable to wear some other form of face covering. If the patient remains uncomfortable with wearing a mask, a member would have to decide as to whether the anticipated benefits of treatment (to the patient) clearly outweigh the risks of COVID -19 to the patient and the practitioner. Practitioners may but are not required , to wear examination or surgical gloves for patient treatments . When used, gloves must be discarded after each treatment regardless of the condition of the glove. Practitioners must also wash their hands before and aft er each treatment. It is important that practitioners main tain hand hygiene even when using gloves. For more information , please see the Safety Program Handbook . Practitioners should be using their regul ar lab coat that is often worn in TCM practice. Similar to masks, these do not need to be changed after each patient unless: The lab coat becomes visibly soiled The lab coat makes contact with the patient's droplets or secretions The lab coat becomes damaged or compromised in any way The use of scrubs is also a suitable alternative for practitioners to wear, at their discretion . They must be removed before leaving the clinic environment and laundered appropriately. The same consideration s would apply i f scrubs become visibly soiled, make contact with the patient's droplets or secretions, or become damaged or compromised in any way. Face shiel ds/eye protection - Members of the College are not recommended to be treating COVID -19 patients, and so face shields or eye protection may not be required for daily practice. However, members are encouraged to maintain a small supply of eye protection or face shields available at their practice to account for situations where a face shield/eye protection may be required. N95 respirators should be used during aerosol generating medical procedures (AGMPs) and when otherwise determined by a regu lated health professional. Practitioners are expected to use their professional judgement and conduct ongoing risk assessments to determine if additional PPE is required.

The Safety Program Handbook . 2. Environment and Equipment Practitioners should e stablish an appropriate cleaning schedule to ensure all surfaces are kept clean and educate their cleaning staff to ensure they understand the importance of their work in a health care setting. Key Points: All equipment used in patient/client contact should be cleaned and disinfected after each use. Clinical contact surfaces (e.g., face cradles, massage/treatment beds/table s) should be cleaned and disinfected after each patient visit. To facilitate clinical cleaning, treatment areas should be uncluttered and well organized. Frequently touched surfaces (e.g., doorknobs, handles, light switches) are most likely to be contaminated and shoul d be cleaned and disinfected more frequently, at least twice per day or when visibly dirty . Use a \"wipe -twice\" method (wipe once to clean, wipe again to disinfect) to both clean and disinfect surfaces. Commonly used cleaners and disinfectants are effective against COVID -19. Check the expiry date of products you use and always follow manufacturer's instructions. Use only disinfectants that have a Drug Identification Number (DIN). A DIN is an 8 -digit number given by Health Canada that confirms it is approved for use in Canada. Health Canada has developed a list of hard -surface disinfectants that are likely to be effective and may be used against COVID -19. For more information , please refer to the List of disinfectants with evidence for use against COVID -19. Practitioners may use linens (washed on -site or handled by a linen service) or disposable paper sheets to cover patient treatment areas. All bed linens, used towels, or disposable paper sheets must be changed between patients. Linens (e.g., sheets, towels, gowns, pillowcases) can be laundered with hot water (70\u00b0C to 80\u00b0C) and soap if there is no visible soiling (bleach can be added as requi red by soiling). For more information on COVID- 19 environmental cleaning, please refer to the Public Health Ontario Factsheet . More information on the management of laundry and bedding can be found in the PIDAC Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Prevention and Contr ol of Infections in All Health Care Settings, 3rd Edition . The Safety Program Handbook , includes additional information about different levels of disinfectants . COVID -19: Return to Practice Guidance - Version Date: August 8 , 2020 Page 7 3. Ensur ing Clinic Safety Prior to resuming work, practitioners should do a thorough assessment of their practice setting(s) and review infection protocols to ensure that they are adequately prepared to return to work safely. Management and St aff Training The training that all clinical staff receive should be continually monitored and updated to reflect changes in policies, procedures, staff changes, and equipment. Included in this training is an understanding of the responsibilities of working in a health care facility, and the requirements to manage their personal health and actions that impact the health and safety of patients. As a TCM practitioner and employer, you are expected to implement reasonable measures to minimize the risk of your s taff acquiring or spreading infection. Training for staff should include an understanding of: Their exposure risks as health care providers; Infection control and prevention strategies that are relevant and specific to their tasks and responsibilities; and Management of personal illness and injury to reduce exposure to others. Practitioners have a professional obligation to remain current on infection and control procedures and to ensure that such practices are implemented in their practices and by their staff. It is expected that TCM practitioners will have written policies and procedures for infection control that are made available to staff and are appropriate. These procedures and policies must be relevant to the practices and duties of staff. For additional resources, please see: Appendix 1 Occupational Health and Safety Requirements The Guidance for Health Sector website: http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/publichealth/coronavirus/2019_guidance.aspx Public Health Ontario Guidance and - diseases/respiratory -diseases/novel -corona virus/public -resources Assess Facility Settings Areas of a clinic may include entryways, treatment rooms , offices, herbal dispensary, shared staff area, washrooms, etc. Practitioners should consider the following: Implementing physical distancing measure s for h igh traffic /shared areas for staff and patients . If possible, organize waiting room seating to comply with physical distancing measures (e.g., spacing chairs further apart) , or if the waiting area is limited, have patients wait in their vehicles/outside the clinic if the waiting area is limited etc. COVID -19: Return to Practice Guidance - Version Date: August 8 , 2020 Page 8 If possible, consider making certain areas of the clinic off- limits or unavailable to patients. Posters and signage in common areas to communicate appropriate hand hygiene , respiratory etiquet te, and COVID -19 symptom recognition . For example, the Government of Ontario Developed the following resources: Signage for Patients (the Ontario Government) -corona virus -pec-poster -en-2020 -03- Consider arranging staggered schedules for practitioners in a multidisciplinary setting to help with physical distancing . Using telephone, video conferencing, or the internet instead of in -person meetings (when clinically appropriate) . For more information please see the Telepractice Position Statement . Provid ing access to handwashing stations/sinks and have alcohol -based hand sanitizers at prominent locations in the practice setting . Assess the supply of cleaning and disinfection products for the practice spaces. Assess how often common spaces are cleaned and disinfected during the workday . Surfaces that have frequent contact with hands should be cleaned and disinfected more frequently, at least twice per day or when visibly dirty . Consider keeping a cleaning log to record the times and clinic areas that are sanitized throughout the day . (Sample in Appendix 2) If applicable, remove commonly accessed materials from waiting room (e.g., magazines or pamphlets ). Where possible, implement contactless payment. Consider keeping products or devices for sale to the public in a display case or behind a barrier to limit contact. Assess if physical changes to the clinic need to be made to provide adequate barriers during the appointment/treatment. Isolation Protocol for Practitioners and Staff Suspected or Confirmed Case of COVID -19 in the Workplace If a practitioner or staff member develops COVID -19 symptoms, they should return home and self -isolate immediately. o If they cannot leave immediately, the y should be isolated in a specific space until they are able to leave. If they are extremely ill , call 911 and let the operator know that the person may have COVID -19. If the y do not have severe symptoms, they should use Ontario's self -assessment tool , and seek assessment and testing (e.g., at an assessment centre) if indicated t o do so. They can also contact their health care provider or Telehealth Ontario (1 -866-797-0000). COVID -19: Return to Practice Guidance - Version Date: August 8 , 2020 Page 9 Workers who have tested positive for COVID -19 must self -isolate at home for 14 days. Surfaces that were touched by the ill worker should be disinfected as soo n as possible in accordance with the environmental cleaning procedures and protocols. NOTE : Practitioners should not be returning to work if they are exhibiting symptoms of COVID - 19 or other infectious conditions. If a practitioner has screened positive, they should inform their supervisor immediately , if applicable, and contact their primary car e provider or Telehealth Ontario (1 -866-797-0000) for further direction on clinical assessment. Public Health Ontario has factsheets that can be used to educate clinic staff and patients regarding how to self -monitor and self- isolate. How to Self -Monitor and How to Self -Isolate 4. Resuming Clinical Activities This section provides practitioners with information that they can use to protect their workers and patients. Pre-Appointment Protocols It is the responsibility of the practitioner to protect all patients who have come to them for health care through vigilant patient management and a clean clinical environment. Before seeing the patient f or consultation or treatment, practitioners should: Screen patients when making appointments on the phone for symptoms, close contact or recent positive diagnosis of COVID -19 or other infectious condition s. Instruct patients and visitors to wear masks (if available and tolerated). Ask screening questions before patients enter the clinic . Consider staggering patient appointments to minimize patient contact in the waiting room. Try to l eave at least 30 minutes between each appointment. If possible, ask patients to limit necessary companions to only one person per appointment. Consider placing signage or creating phone messaging to ask potential walk -in patients to phone in first, prior to entering the clinic. If possible, consider having patients wait in their vehicles or make alternative arrangements if a designated waiting room or area is unavailable. Limit number of patients in clinic at any given time. Patient Screening At a minimum, practitioners or clinic staff should undertake the following forms of screening: Active screening over the phone before scheduling appointments, when possible and upon entry to the clinic. Staff conducting screening should ideally be behind a barrier to protect from droplet/contact spread. A plexiglass barrier can protect reception staff from sneezing/ coughing patients. COVID -19: Return to Practice Guidance - Version Date: August 8 , 2020 Page 10 Passive screening including signage at points of entry of the facility and at reception, using the latest case definition f or COVID -19. Similar messaging can be communicated on voicemails and websites. For more information, visit the government website at http://www. health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/publichealth/coronavirus/docs/2019_ihf_guidance .pdf Individuals who accompany patients, must also be screened with the same questions. Patients with signs and symptoms consistent with COVID -19 should not be seen in- person f or clinical services during this time. Screening Questions For the most up to date list of screening questions, please refer to th e Ministry of Health Patient Screening Guidance Document . For the most up to date list of symptoms please refer to http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/publichealth/coronavirus/docs/2019_refer ence_doc_symptoms.pdf Screening Results COVID -19 Screen Negative: If response to ALL the screening questions is NO. COVID -19 Screen Positive: If response to ANY the screening questions is YES . The Ministry of Health provides further information in the Patient Screening Guidance Document . Procedures for patients who screen positive for COVID- 19 COVID -19 is a designated disease of pu blic health significance (O. Reg. 135/18) and thus reportable under the Health Protection and Promotion Act . Regulated health professionals should contact their local public health unit to report a person suspected or confirmed to have COVID -19. Positive screening over the phone or at time of appointment: If a patient has screened positive over the phone or in -person , practitioners encourage patients who have symptoms to complete the online self- assessment tool before calling their primary care provider or Telehealth Ontario (1 -866-797-0000) for further clinical assessment. All testing for COVID -19 will take place through hospitals, assessment centres and/or through primary care providers. Home and community care providers must not conduct testing. If individuals are referred to hospital (e.g., emergency department) for testing, the practitioner and/or agency should coordinate with the hospital, local public health unit, paramedic services, and the patient , to make safe arrangements for travel to the hospital incorporating Public Health Ontario's Droplet and Contact Precautions . All referrals to hospital should be made to a triage nurse. COVID -19: Return to Practice Guidance - Version Date: August 8 , 2020 Page 11 If a patient is very ill and requires acute care, the care provider should call 9 11 and let them know that the client has symptoms of COVID -19. If a patient screens positive during in -person screening, follow the Public Health guidelines for proper cleaning and disinfection, and reporting requirements. All surfaces that were touched b y the patient should be disinfected as soon as possible in accordance with the environmental cleaning procedures and protocols. Patients with signs and symptoms consistent with COVID -19 should not be seen in- person for clinical services during this time. During Consultation or Treatment Procedures Wash or sanitize hands before treatment . Ensure that practitioners and staff have the proper PPE . Implement physical distancing between staff. Instruct patients and visitors to wear masks , where possible. Ask patients to wash or sanitize hands upon arrival. Open window s for air ventilation where possible . Exercise heightened pre caution s for treatments that may damage skin surface (e.g., Gua Sha) . Areas of broken skin increase the risk of infectio n transmission. For more information, please refer to the Safety Program Handbook . After Consultation or Treatment Procedures Ask patients to wa sh or sanitize hands after the appointment . Change your surgical, procedural , or medical mask if necessary (e.g., if the mask became visibly soiled) . If used , gloves must be disposed of and changed between each patient. Changing your protective clothing, or lab coat , as required , especially if they have come into contact with biological fluids (e.g. nasal, oral or pulmonary secretions) or if contact is suspected . Clean safety glasses and prescription glasses, if necessary . Follow the procedures f or taking off PPE. Ensure that the instruments in the consultation room are cleaned with a surface disinfectant before and after each consultation. 5. Other Recommendations Practitioners may also want to consider the following information : Where possible, implement contactless payment. Otherwise, practice hand hygiene after handling any paperwork, particularly if you come into contact with cash payment s. COVID -19: Return to Practice Guidance - Version Date: August 8 , 2020 Page 12 To help with the possibility of contact tracing, ensure that the daily appointment log is upda ted and contains the following information: name date, time, and duration of appointment. (Please see the Record Keeping Guideline for more information ) If home visitations are provided for consultations or treatments , practitioners should be contact the patient to enquire if anyone on the premises is unwell. A daily log should be kept of all the homes the practitioner has visited while working. If the practitioner touches any surfaces in the home, they should perform hand hygiene immediately after finishing the work. Workers should ensure proper waste disposal, clean, and disinfect all equipment that were used in the home or workplace, and then perform hand hygiene. For more information on conducting home visits, refer to the Ministry of Health guidance for home and community care providers . 6.

These procedures must include: Safe work practices; Safe working conditions; Proper hygiene practices; Use of hygienic facilities; and Control of infections. If COVID -19 is suspected or diagnosed in a worker, return to work should be determined in consultation with their health care provider and the local public health unit, in accordance with provincial g uidance. If the worker's illness is from an exposure at the workplace, an employer must provide a written notice within four days of being advised that a worker has an occupational illness, including an occupationally - acquired infection, or if a claim has been made to the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) by or on behalf of the worker with respect to an occupational illness, including an occupational infection, to the: Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development; Joint health and safety committee (or health and safety representative); and Trade union, if any. The information required in a notice is outlined in sector specific regulations made under the OHSA. Workers who are worried their workplaces are unsafe can phone 1 -877-202-0008. Also, under the Act, employees are required to wear the protective clothing or use protective equipment that the employer has deemed necessary for safety. Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) is a national system for safe management of hazardous materials legislated by federal and provincial jurisdictions. The WHMIS legislation provides that workers must be informed about the hazards in the workplace and receive appropriate train ing to allow them to work safely. WHMIS provides the necessary information for: Cautionary labels on containers of controlled products; The provision of material safety data sheets (MSDS) for each controlled product; and A worker education program.
