In Switzerland, CAM providers play important roles in vaccine counseling of vaccine hesitant (VH) parents, and traditional vaccination messaging tends to overlook CAM provider perspectives. In the setting of a Swiss national research program on VH, our key strategy has been to work together closely with CAM providers. To assess the feasibility of generating educational human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine materials that would interest VH healthcare providers (HCPs), we invited four CAM providers to co-author two HPV vaccine review articles for general practitioners. We conducted thematic analysis of CAM provider comments to identify patterns that could complement and improve vaccination messaging from CAM perspectives. We identified several themes and generated an inventory of CAM provider messaging recommendations related to language use, presentation of background information, nuanced statements regarding HPV vaccine efficacy and safety, and communication tools that would be important to VH HCPs. Contrary to our initial expectations, and in an inclusive, respectful atmosphere of open dialogue, we were able to productively finalize our manuscripts. In the opinion of the CAM co-authors, the manuscripts effectively considered the communication needs and perspectives of VH HCPs. Engaging with CAM providers appears to be a feasible and innovative avenue for providing vaccine information and designing communication tools aimed at VH healthcare providers.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-02-21", "cleaned_text": "Collaborating with Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) Providers When Writing HPV Vaccine Review Articles [https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9020592](https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9020592) [Infectious Diseases](/journal/jcm/sections/Infectious_Diseases)) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-jcm-09-00592)]. Understanding VH remains a puzzling challenge for clinicians and public health authorities [ [2](#B2-jcm-09-00592), [3](#B3-jcm-09-00592), [4](#B4-jcm-09-00592)]. Strategies to address VH have included reinforcing traditional information approaches focused on improving knowledge [ [5](#B5-jcm-09-00592)], clinicians using presumptive rather than participatory communication styles [ [6](#B6-jcm-09-00592)], motivational interviewing [ [7](#B7-jcm-09-00592)], and vaccine mandates [ [8](#B8-jcm-09-00592), [9](#B9-jcm-09-00592), [10](#B10-jcm-09-00592)]. In response to the WHO's announcement about the \"threat\" of VH, strategies to address VH are urgently needed. [11](#B11-jcm-09-00592)], with popular narratives typically decrying CAM users and providers as categorically anti-vaccine [ [12](#B12-jcm-09-00592)]. However, research conducted in the setting of our national research program on VH [ [13](#B13-jcm-09-00592), [14](#B14-jcm-09-00592)] has suggested that providers of CAM in Switzerland are not categorically anti-vaccine. They prefer providing individualized vaccination counseling, which includes taking time to understand parent vaccine wishes, involving parents in vaccine decisions, and taking their vaccine concerns seriously [ [15](#B15-jcm-09-00592)]. [16](#B16-jcm-09-00592), [17](#B17-jcm-09-00592), [18](#B18-jcm-09-00592)]. Based on repeated suggestions to us by Swiss CAM providers that VH HCPs are unlikely to even read review articles that employ the traditional communication approach that vaccines are safe and effective, we tested a strategy of listening to CAM providers' perspectives and including them as co-authors in our review articles and communication tools for HPV vaccines. To our knowledge, CAM providers, who play an important role in vaccination counseling in Switzerland, have previously not been involved in similar collaborations. We hypothesized that, in order to reach VH HCPs, it is important to use nuanced language that considers particular vaccine concerns and communication needs. The endpoint of our collaboration was therefore to write HPV vaccine review articles together with CAM doctors so that VH HCPs would actually read them. [19](#B19-jcm-09-00592), [20](#B20-jcm-09-00592)] written for Swiss general practitioners (both articles originally in German, one translated to French). Overall, our findings suggest that including CAM providers in the collaborative writing of vaccine review articles is a feasible, productive, and potentially promising approach to design communication tools for clinical practice in order to address VH. 2. Methods [21](#B21-jcm-09-00592), [22](#B22-jcm-09-00592)], reimbursed through mandatory basic health insurance when provided by medical doctors with additional postgraduate training and certification in anthroposophic medicine, traditional Chinese medicine/acupuncture, phytotherapy, or homeopathy [ [23](#B23-jcm-09-00592)], and often provided by medical doctors who have undertaken additional CAM training [ [24](#B24-jcm-09-00592)]. According to the register of medical professions of the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH), there are 1051 licensed medical doctors with additional accredited CAM training [ [25](#B25-jcm-09-00592)]. However, the number of licensed medical doctors who practice CAM or offer CAM services without full accreditation is likely higher. A representative study of pediatricians in Switzerland reported that 23% of pediatricians had attended CM training, but only 8% had a federal certificate in one or more of these methods [ [26](#B26-jcm-09-00592)]. The same study found that 97% of pediatrician respondents reported patients and parents inquiring about CAM, 65% were interested in pursuing CAM training, 16% provided CAM to their patients, and more than 50% used CAM for themselves or their families. [27](#B27-jcm-09-00592)]. However, there is high variance in HPV vaccination coverage between the different Swiss cantons (states). Cantonal coverage ranges from 19% to 79% for two doses of the HPV vaccine among 16-year-old females, and estimates for males are not yet available [ [27](#B27-jcm-09-00592)]. HPV vaccination is the vaccination that has achieved lowest coverage nationally among those recommended in the national vaccination plan [ [27](#B27-jcm-09-00592), [28](#B28-jcm-09-00592)]. [19](#B19-jcm-09-00592), [20](#B20-jcm-09-00592)]. One article was published, in both German and French, in Swiss Medical Forum, a peer-reviewed journal published by the Swiss Medical Association. In surveys, it has repeatedly been recorded as the most widely read continuing medical education journal in Switzerland, with 39,000 copies printed per issue [ [29](#B29-jcm-09-00592)]. The other article was published in German in Ars Medici, a popular Swiss family medicine journal, with 7500 copies printed per issue. Our goal was to write and frame review articles with CAM providers in order to craft messages about HPV vaccine which would be palatable also to VH HCPs while at the same time providing medically sound, evidence-based information. The intent of both articles was to generate tools for providers, including VH HCPs, to engage in high-quality HPV vaccine counseling, which has been demonstrated as an important factor when addressing patient VH [ [30](#B30-jcm-09-00592), [31](#B31-jcm-09-00592), [32](#B32-jcm-09-00592)]. [33](#B33-jcm-09-00592)] suggestions regarding the 6 phases of thematic analysis: getting familiar with the data, generating initial codes, searching for themes, reviewing themes, defining and naming themes, and producing the report ([ [33](#B33-jcm-09-00592)], p. 87). We used the Framework Method [ [34](#B34-jcm-09-00592)] to structure our analyses and used MAXQDA software to code and organize our data into meaningful themes. 3. Results 3.1. Language and Terminology [35](#B35-jcm-09-00592)], would lead VH HCPs to not even read the manuscripts. They recommended that we opt for nuances such as the vaccine \"is considered\" to be safe and effective. Other linguistic nuances included statements that were presented as proven facts, whereas there might be underlying uncertainty; they recommended we state, \"most experts agree\", rather agree\". [Table 2](#jcm-09-00592-t002)). 3.3. Vaccine Safety [15](#B15-jcm-09-00592), [36](#B36-jcm-09-00592)]. Finally, CAM co-authors agreed that we point to the collective benefit of the HPV vaccine outweighing the minimal potential risks ( [Table 3](#jcm-09-00592-t003)). 3.4. Vaccine Communication Tools for Clinical Consultation [Table 4](#jcm-09-00592-t004)). 3.5. Additional Important Items [Table 5](#jcm-09-00592-t005)). 4. Discussion [Table 6](#jcm-09-00592-t006)(below) summarizes the key strategies recommended by CAM doctors for vaccine communication that gets vaccine-skeptical HCP on board. Third, and perhaps most importantly, our collaboration with four reviewing CAM doctors was constructive and resulted in messaging that was largely in favor of vaccination. This stands in contrast to popular narratives which pigeonhole CAM users and providers as categorically anti-vaccine [ [12](#B12-jcm-09-00592)], or those who express skepticism towards vaccination as 'opponents' [ [37](#B37-jcm-09-00592)]. [38](#B38-jcm-09-00592)]. Thomson et al. point to the need to \"understand and act upon the fact that there is no one-size fits all strategy to solve vaccine hesitancy and that collaborative efforts are needed and must be sustained over time\" ([ [38](#B38-jcm-09-00592)], p. 6458). We were particularly impressed, despite initial skepticism on both sides, to be able to frame our reviews and communication tools in ways that were in line with official HPV vaccine recommendations, but also sensitive to providing HPV disease and vaccine information with nuanced language for issues where VH HCPs might have particular degrees of skepticism and concerns. Recognizing that language matters in healthcare [ [39](#B39-jcm-09-00592), [40](#B40-jcm-09-00592)], and that nuanced language choice can both empower and stigmatize in the oft-polarized discussions around vaccination, will be important for establishing meaningful dialogue in future efforts to address VH. [19](#B19-jcm-09-00592), [20](#B20-jcm-09-00592)] was to ensure that these materials would be read not only by HCPs already favorable to vaccination, but useful particularly to the additional target audience of VH HCPs. To our knowledge, a CAM-inclusive approach has not yet been used in creating vaccine messaging materials for use in clinical practice. Additionally, this collaboration offers an innovative approach seeking to address VH around HPV vaccine, which is the vaccine listed on the Swiss vaccination schedule that has attained the lowest coverage in Switzerland [ [27](#B27-jcm-09-00592), [28](#B28-jcm-09-00592)]. Importantly, WHO cited healthcare professionals as \"the most trusted advisor[s] and influencer[s] of vaccination decisions\" [ [1](#B1-jcm-09-00592)]. Oehler [ [41](#B41-jcm-09-00592)] recently echoed these statements in response to the recent global measles resurgence: \"New tools are needed for physicians and healthcare providers to reverse this trend and regain our role as patient's best advocates\". In our view, our review articles clearly benefited from CAM doctors' emphasis on patient-oriented medicine and from their focus on building trusting relationships with patients and families, which have been shown as important considerations for VH patients. [13](#B13-jcm-09-00592), [14](#B14-jcm-09-00592)] has recruited a network of more than 150 medical professionals throughout Switzerland, including more than 40 CAM practitioners. Given the popularity and interest towards CAM of the Swiss population [ [21](#B21-jcm-09-00592), [22](#B22-jcm-09-00592)] and from pediatricians [ [26](#B26-jcm-09-00592)], the incorporation of CAM perspectives and engagement with practitioners of both CAM and biomedicine into vaccination communication strategies is, in our view, a feasible, innovative, and reasonable approach to addressing VH in the Swiss context. 5. Conclusions [15](#B15-jcm-09-00592), [42](#B42-jcm-09-00592)], and that biomedicine can incorporate CAM vaccination perspectives into materials destined for all HCPs. Through such collaboration, we have shown how it is possible to work with individuals that popular narratives would have us believe to be 'the opponent' when it comes to VH [ [37](#B37-jcm-09-00592)]. Addressing VH in clinical practice can, and should, benefit from multiple perspectives and involve all culturally relevant and appropriate stakeholders while informing medical review articles and communication tools for HCPs.

State this as a hypothesis. |Protection against dysplasia should not be underestimated||-It is helpful to mention that a diagnosis of cervical dysplasia can be associated with uncertainty and anxiety for many months.||-However, do not let this create the impression that the vaccine is 100% effective in preventing dysplasia, which could lead to reduced enthusiasm for continuing to undergo dysplasia screening at regular intervals.| -Rather, mention that HPV vaccine and dysplasia screening are complementary cancer prevention methods for the time being. |Duration of vaccine protection||-The duration of protection is an important component of high-quality HPV vaccine counseling.| -Hesitancy towards HPV vaccine is in part related to the fact that it is unclear if booster doses will be necessary. |-With only 13 years of experience with HPV vaccines, it seems premature to conclude that HPV protection is likely to last for at least 20 years. Use clear language about this, and provide references.| -It seems premature to anticipate that vaccine protection will be lifelong. It is acceptable to state this as speculation. |Natural vs. vaccine-induced antibodies||-Your point that HPV vaccination induces HPV antibodies much more reliably, at higher serum concentration than \"natural\" HPV infection, and that vaccine-induced antibodies are protective against future infection with other HPV types, in contrast to naturally-induced antibodies, is important.| -CAM providers are typically very interested in the concept that dysplasia is a sign that the body was unable to eliminate acute HPV infection, and that, in those with cancer, the body was unable to reverse dysplasia. |-Making such a statement is helpful to reduce HPV vaccine hesitancy among VH HCPs.| -Making this point is also important because it distinguishes immunity towards HPV from immunity towards measles, where naturally acquired immunity persists lifelong whereas vaccine-induced immunity may wane and cease to protect. -The concept of the possibility of non-clearance of HPV infections and dysplasia, respectively, are important arguments for the HPV vaccine. |Item||CAM Doctor Comments||CAM Co-Author Recommendations That We Included into Revised Manuscripts| |Local adverse effects of HPV vaccine||-You extensively discuss local adverse reactions to HPV vaccine, even though they are no different from other vaccines (i.e., pain, swelling at injection site).||-Do not let the discussion of local reactions create the impression that you are downplaying the importance of the long-term safety of HPV vaccine, which clearly is more important.| |Case reports of serious adverse events following HPV vaccination||-There are case reports suggesting an association of HPV vaccine with auto-immune and other serious illnesses: The link between vaccines and their potential for triggering pre-existing autoimmunity is an exciting field of investigation and points to the individual immune response to any vaccine.| -This is not unlike the well-known association of antibiotic treatment of otitis media with rare side effects (e.g., anaphylaxis to penicillin, clostridium difficile colitis). Nobody would put into doubt the need to use antibiotics, when they are indicated, due to safety concerns. Similarly, nobody would stop driving a car for safety reasons, even though there certainly are more deaths attributable to car accidents than to adverse vaccine effects. Being mindful about the rare possibility of a car accident likely leads to more careful driving. Being mindful about the rare possibility of a serious adverse vaccine reaction may lead to more careful medical care of HPV-vaccinated persons. |-Acknowledge the existence of case reports of rare but serious illnesses following HPV vaccination, without using fear. Giving these case reports some space will provide for a more well-balanced article and will be crucial to enhance the credibility and acceptability of your article to VH HCPs.| -Even if they are, do not dismiss these case reports as irrelevant or inferior quality evidence. CAM providers are more likely than biomedical physicians to accept \"experiential\" types of evidence, such as personal experiences and individual case reports. Do not underestimate their importance. -These case reports should not be overly dramatized, as is currently the case in the media and via dramatic reports by overt anti-vaxxers. |Large scale epidemiological data suggests no serious long-term harm of HPV vaccine||-The overall statement that HPV vaccine is a safe vaccine is credible.| -Most VH HCPs will agree that this large-scale epidemiological data is robust, high-quality evidence supporting the safety of HPV vaccine. WHO states that after 270 million doses of HPV vaccine administered, no signals of any serious vaccine adverse effects have emerged. This statement may be counterproductive and make VH HCPs more skeptical because these data have been collected, in part, by vaccine manufacturers. This reduces the trustworthiness of the data and, therefore, confidence in the safety of HPV vaccines. |-Consider putting these 2 concepts back to back in the manuscript by first stating, \"Rare case reports suggest possible associations of HPV vaccine with multiple sclerosis\".| -Follow this sentence by pointing out that large epidemiological studies \"were unable to confirm these associations\". -Mention that long-term safety data is in being collected, in part, by vaccine manufacturers. -Even large-scale epidemiological studies cannot rule out that in rare cases, the HPV vaccine can be harmful to an individual patient. Mention this. -Therefore, HPV vaccine communication needs to be appropriately balanced and circumspect, particularly because there is no epidemiological emergency to vaccinate the population. Mention this. |Individual risk vs. collective benefit||Safety is a crucial aspect of any preventive measure, particularly for the HPV vaccine because it is now recommended for the entire population of young men and women.||-Mention that only a small fraction of vaccinated persons will individually benefit because HPV-associated cancers are overall rare.| Mention vaccine safety as an important consideration because if everybody benefits from HPV vaccination, it is an acceptable assumption that the benefits outweigh the potential side effects. This will make the manuscript more balanced and acceptable to VH HCP readers. |Item||CAM Doctor Comments||CAM Co-Author Recommendations That We Included into Revised Manuscripts||CAM Co-Author Recommendations That We Did Not Include and Reasons for Not Including Them| |The decision to vaccinate or not to vaccinate||-Your statement that physicians should \"patiently\" and \"extensively\" provide HPV vaccine information is good. | -Your statement that physicians should \"inform\" about HPV vaccine is good, and preferable to \"recommending\" the vaccine. -For those who agreed to receive HPV vaccine, proceeding to vaccinating without providing the patient with information is problematic (vaccine consent should be treated like pre-operative informed consent) |-Mention these points explicitly: | -Vaccination remains voluntary in Switzerland. Doctors and patients are free in their decision to vaccinate or not. -Good health and a relationship of trust with physicians is possible for parents and adolescents with or without the HPV vaccine. -Patients have a right to be informed in a well-balanced, circumspect manner about HPV vaccine. -Physicians should accept and respect patients' personal vaccination decisions. -Doctors should invite patients to voice their concerns and ask questions about HPV vaccine even if they want the vaccine and have no questions about it. |Talking about sexual matters||-Many physicians feel uneasy when discussing sexual matters. This is a main reason for poor HPV vaccine counseling and contributes to HPV vaccine hesitancy. | -Discussion of sexual topics requires an adequate amount of time. -Discussion of sexual topics with young adolescents in the recommended target age range (11-14 years old) makes physicians even more uneasy. -In general, vaccine counseling is inadequately reimbursed. |-Placing the emphasis on dysplasia/cancer prevention rather than prevention of an STD is acceptable. But do not \"de-sexualize\" the HPV vaccine. This is incompatible with an informed HPV vaccine decision.| -Emphasize that HPV vaccination does not obviate the need for \"safer sex\" measures. -At 15-16 years, adolescents typically are ready for safer sex counseling. Many CAM physicians consider that HPV vaccine should not be given at 11-14 years but rather a few years later. Mention this as a possibility. |-We did not increase the HPV vaccine target age from 11-14 to 15-16 years and retained the official recommendation: HPV vaccine is ideally administered prior to individuals becoming sexually active.| |Vaccine administration in conjunction with the hepatitis B vaccine||-It is correct to state that the HPV vaccine can be given at the same time as the hepatitis B vaccine.||-Some VH HCPs and CAM providers prefer to give HPV and hepatitis B vaccine at different times in order for them to be able to attribute potential safety issues to each individual vaccine. Mention this as a possibility.||-We did not modify our statement because we did not find HPV and HBV vaccine safety concerns sufficient enough to warrant this type of discussion.| |Item||CAM Doctor Comments||CAM Co-Author Recommendations that We Included into Revised Manuscripts| |Background information on HPV infection||-The manuscripts begin with pro-vaccine statements about the safety and efficacy of the HPV vaccine. This gives impression that the manuscript is \"pro-vaccine propaganda\"||-A well-balanced article should begin with extensive background information on HPV infection (natural history, complications), rather than HPV vaccine| -Mention and underline that: -The recommendation to vaccinate boys and young men is not yet well known among general practitioners, rather than stating that we \"now we need to introduce the vaccine\" in young men. -HPV infection is the most common sexually transmitted infection. -HPV infection is harmless (i.e., transient) in >90% of the cases. -Cancer is a rare complication of HPV infections. -There are known risk factors (i.e., unprotected sex, number of sex partners) that support individualized HPV vaccine counseling. -There is no antiviral therapy available. This is in fact a pro-vaccine argument. -The goal of HPV vaccine is protection against dysplasia, rather than against a sexually transmitted infection. |HPV vaccine is different from other vaccines||-The concept that HPV vaccine is used to prevent dysplasia and cancer stands in contrast to all other vaccines where the goal is to prevent acute infections.| -This point once more underscores the need to differentiate between individual vaccines when discussing the notion of \"vaccine hesitancy\", particularly among patients who might not have categorical attitudes towards all vaccines. -This point is important also because, for example, not vaccinating against measles carries a considerable risk for the child to acquire measles, whereas not vaccinating against HPV carries little long-term risk, because most HPV infections are transient and can be prevented, at least partially, by other means (i.e., safe sex practices, fewer sexual partners, cervical cancer screening). |-This is a point definitely worth emphasizing because it is crucial for understanding why HPV vaccine might be important and therefore crucial for vaccine counseling.| -Emphasize that there is no need to use fear as a communication strategy in order to promote the HPV vaccine. -It is OK to state that, similarly, there is no need by vaccine skeptics to use fear (of serious side effects, e.g., multiple sclerosis) to discourage vaccine. |Vaccination of boys and young men||-The discussion of cancer at the oropharynx and anus is important.||-This should be elaborated in order to address the prevalent notion that the HPV vaccine is only indicated for women.| |High cost of the vaccine||-HPV vaccine is the most expensive, widely recommended vaccine. | -The high vaccine cost puts a strain on already tight public health budgets, even in a rich country like Switzerland. -The HPV vaccine is very lucrative for vaccine manufacturers. |-The financial aspects surrounding HPV vaccine should not be kept secret, as has been the case until now. This secrecy is a major driver of vaccine hesitancy| -The high cost of HPV vaccines should be discussed appropriately. Please clarify whether taxpayer money is being used to subsidize the vaccine. |HPV vaccine coverage of >70% may be sufficient to lead to herd protection in a given population||-This is an important point.||-Elaborate further with relevant references.| \u00a9 2020 by the authors.
