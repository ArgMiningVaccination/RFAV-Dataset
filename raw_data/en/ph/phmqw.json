{"title": "The Use of Instrument-Assisted Soft-Tissue Mobilization for Manual Medicine: Aiding Hand Health in Clinical Practice", "author": "Luigi Pianese; Bruno Bordoni", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "Instrument-assisted soft-tissue mobilization (IASTM) represents a treatment strategy for soft tissue (skin) and musculoskeletal tissue (myofascia). There are different morphologies of these tools that are used by clinicians and manual therapists for the management of scars, fibrotic formations, muscle-joint pain, and movement limitations. The literature demonstrates the effectiveness of IASTMs in different clinical areas. However, the literature does not consider the use of these tools for the protection of the clinician's hands. The main objective of this article is to draw attention to the fact that IASTM can protect clinicians from professional joint injuries of the hands and can likely become a preventive tool for the operator. Further research is needed to fully determine the positive adaptations in operators who use IASTMs compared to those who do not use them.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2022-08-31", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
