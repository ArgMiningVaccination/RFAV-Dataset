Autism is a [spectrum disorder](/wiki/Spectrum_disorder), meaning that it can manifest very differently in each person. For example, some are [nonspeaking](/wiki/Nonverbal_autism), while others have proficient [spoken language](/wiki/Spoken_language). Because of this, there is wide variation in the support needs of people across the autism spectrum. There are many theories about [what causes autism](/wiki/Causes_of_autism); it is [highly heritable and mainly genetic](/wiki/Heritability_of_autism), but many genes are involved, and environmental factors may also be relevant. [[7]](#cite_note-7) The syndrome frequently co-occurs with other conditions, including [attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder), [epilepsy](/wiki/Epilepsy), and [intellectual disability](/wiki/Intellectual_disability). Disagreements persist about what should be included as part of the diagnosis, whether there are meaningful subtypes of autism, [[8]](#cite_note-The_Diagnosis_of_Autism:_From_Kanne-8) and the significance of autism-associated traits in the wider population. [[9]](#cite_note-9) [[10]](#cite_note-10) The combination of broader criteria, increased awareness, and potentially increasing actual prevalence, has led to a trend of steadily increasing estimates of [autism prevalence](/wiki/Epidemiology_of_autism), [[11]](#cite_note-11) perpetuating the myth that it is [caused by vaccines](/wiki/Vaccines_and_autism). [[12]](#cite_note-:9-12) [Psychiatry](/wiki/Psychiatry) has traditionally classified autism as a [mental disorder](/wiki/Mental_disorder), and the [autism rights movement](/wiki/Autism_rights_movement) and a small but increasing number of researchers see autism as part of [neurodiversity](/wiki/Neurodiversity), the natural diversity in human thinking and experience, with strengths, differences, and weaknesses. [[13]](#cite_note-Pellicano-13) From this point of view, autistic people often still have a [disability](/wiki/Disability), but need to be accommodated rather than cured. [[14]](#cite_note-14) [[15]](#cite_note-15) This perspective has led to significant controversy among those who are autistic and advocates, practitioners, and charities. [[16]](#cite_note-16) [[17]](#cite_note-17) Some therapies for autism, such as applied behavior analysis, are controversial in the [autism rights movement](/wiki/Autism_rights_movement), with many considering them unhelpful and unethical. [[18]](#cite_note-18) There is no known way to prevent or cure autism. Many forms of [therapy](/wiki/Autism_therapies), such as speech and occupational therapy, have been developed that may help autistic people. Some forms of therapy, such as [applied behavior analysis](/wiki/Applied_behavior_analysis), have been shown to improve certain symptoms of autism, such as socialization, communication, expressive language, [[19]](#cite_note-19) intellectual functioning, language development, and acquisition of daily living skills. [[20]](#cite_note-20) Intervention can require accommodations such as [alternative modes of communication](/wiki/Augmentative_and_alternative_communication). The use of pharmaceutical medicine is usually focused on associated conditions such as epilepsy or certain symptoms. [[21]](#cite_note-21) Research [indicates that autistic people](/wiki/Autism_and_LGBT_identities) are substantially more likely to be [LGBT](/wiki/LGBT_community) than the general population. [[22]](#cite_note-Graham_Holmes-2022-22) They are also significantly more likely to be [non-theistic](/wiki/Nontheism). [[23]](#cite_note-:42-23) Classification Spectrum model Before the [DSM-5](/wiki/DSM-5) (2013) and [ICD-11](/wiki/ICD-11) (2022) diagnostic manuals were adopted, what is now called ASD was found under the diagnostic category [pervasive developmental disorder](/wiki/Pervasive_developmental_disorder). The previous system relied on a set of closely related and overlapping diagnoses such as [Asperger syndrome](/wiki/Asperger_syndrome) and [Kanner syndrome](/wiki/Classic_autism). This created unclear boundaries between the terms, so for the DSM-5 and ICD-11, a spectrum approach was taken. The new system is also more restrictive, meaning fewer people now qualify for diagnosis. [[24]](#cite_note-24) The DSM-5 and ICD-11 use different categorization tools to define this spectrum. DSM-5 uses a \"level\" system, which ranks how in need of support the patient is, [[25]](#cite_note-25) while the ICD-11 system has two axes, intellectual impairment and language impairment, [[26]](#cite_note-26) as these are seen as the most crucial factors. It is now known that autism is a highly variable [neurodevelopmental disorder](/wiki/Neurodevelopmental_disorder) [[27]](#cite_note-Geschwind-27) that is generally thought to cover a broad and deep [spectrum](/wiki/Spectrum_disorder), manifesting very differently from one person to another. Some have high support needs, may be [non-speaking](/wiki/Nonverbal_autism), and experience developmental delays; this is more likely with other co-existing diagnoses. Others have relatively low support needs; they may have more typical speech-language and intellectual skills but atypical social/conversation skills, narrowly focused interests, and wordy, [pedantic](/wiki/Pedant) communication. [[28]](#cite_note-28) They may still require significant support in some areas of their lives. The spectrum model should not be understood as a continuum running from mild to severe, but instead means that autism can present very differently in each person. [[29]](#cite_note-29) How a person presents can depend on context, and may vary over time. [[30]](#cite_note-30) While the DSM and ICD greatly influence each other, there are also differences. For example, [Rett syndrome](/wiki/Rett_syndrome) was included in ASD in the DSM-5, but in the ICD-11 it was excluded and placed in the chapter on Developmental Anomalies. The ICD and the DSM change over time, and there has been collaborative work toward a convergence of the two since 1980 (when [DSM-III](/wiki/DSM-3) was published and [ICD-9](/wiki/ICD-9) was current), including more rigorous biological assessment\u2014in place of historical experience\u2014and a simplification of the classification Diseases](/wiki/International_Classification_of_Diseases) (11th Revision), [ICD-11](/wiki/ICD-11), was released in June 2018 and came into full effect as of January 2022. [[35]](#cite_note-WHO_2021-35) [[31]](#cite_note-Pickett_&_Anderson-31) It describes ASD as follows: [[36]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEICD-11-36) Autism spectrum disorder is characterised by persistent deficits in the ability to initiate and to sustain reciprocal social interaction and social communication, and by a range of restricted, repetitive, and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or activities that are clearly atypical or excessive for the individual's age and sociocultural context. The onset of the disorder occurs during the developmental period, typically in early childhood, but symptoms may not become fully manifest until later, when social demands exceed limited capacities. Deficits are sufficiently severe to cause impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning and are usually a pervasive feature of the individual's functioning observable in all settings, although they may vary according to social, educational, or other context. Individuals along the spectrum exhibit a full range of intellectual functioning and language abilities.\u2014 ICD-11, chapter 6, section A02 ICD-11 was produced by professionals from 55 countries out of the 90 involved and is the most widely used reference worldwide. DSM The [American Psychiatric Association](/wiki/American_Psychiatric_Association)'s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision ( [DSM-5-TR](/wiki/DSM-5-TR)), released in 2022, is the current version of the DSM. It is the predominant mental health diagnostic system used in the United States and Canada, and is often used in Anglophone countries. Its fifth edition, [DSM-5](/wiki/DSM-5), released in May 2013, was the first to define ASD as a single diagnosis, [[37]](#cite_note-37) which is still the case in the DSM-5-TR. [[38]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDSM-5-TR-38) ASD encompasses previous diagnoses, including the four not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS)](/wiki/Pervasive_developmental_disorder_not_otherwise_specified)\u2014and the range of diagnoses that included the word \"autism\". [[39]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDSM-5-TR\"Autism_spectrum_disorder_encompasses_disorders_previously_referred_to_as_early_infantile_autism,_childhood_autism,_Kanner's_autism,_[[high-functioning_autism]],_[[atypical_autism]],_pervasive_developmental_disorder_not_otherwise_specified,_childhood_disintegrative_disorder,_and_Asperger's_disorder\"-39) Rather than distinguishing among these diagnoses, the DSM-5 and DSM-5-TR adopt a dimensional approach to diagnosing disorders that fall underneath the autism spectrum umbrella in one diagnostic category. Within this category, the DSM-5 and the DSM include a framework that differentiates each person by dimensions of symptom severity, as well as by associated features (i.e., the presence of other disorders or factors that likely contribute to the symptoms, other neurodevelopmental or mental disorders, intellectual disability, or language impairment). [[38]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDSM-5-TR-38) The symptom domains are social communication and restricted, repetitive behaviors, with the option of a separate severity\u2014the negative impact of the symptoms on the person\u2014being specified for each domain, rather than an overall severity. [[40]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDSM-5-TR\"It_may_be_helpful_to_note_level_of_support_needed_for_each_of_the_two_core_psychopathological_domains_in_Table_2_(e.g.,_'requiring_very_substantial_support_for_deficits_in_social_communication_and_requiring_substantial_support_for_restricted,_repetitive_behaviors')\"-40) Before the DSM-5, the DSM separated social deficits and communication deficits into two domains. [[41]](#cite_note-41) Further, the DSM-5 changed to an onset age in the early developmental period, with a note that symptoms may manifest later when social demands exceed capabilities, rather than the previous, more restricted three years of age. [[42]](#cite_note-IACC-42) These changes remain in the DSM-5-TR. [[38]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDSM-5-TR-38) Common characteristics Pre-diagnosis For many autistic people, characteristics first appear during infancy or childhood and follow a steady course without [remission](/wiki/Remission_(medicine)) (different developmental timelines are described in more detail below). [[43]](#cite_note-ICD-10-F84.0-43) Autistic people may be severely impaired in some respects but average, or even superior, in others. [[44]](#cite_note-44) [[45]](#cite_note-45) [[46]](#cite_note-46) Clinicians consider assessment for ASD when a patient shows: - regular difficulties in social interaction or communication - restricted or repetitive behaviors (often called \" [stimming](/wiki/Stimming)\") - resistance to changes or restricted interests These features are typically assessed with the following, when appropriate: - problems in obtaining or sustaining employment or education - difficulties in initiating or sustaining social relationships - connections with mental health or learning disability services - a history of neurodevelopmental conditions (including learning disabilities and [ADHD](/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder)) or mental health conditions. [[47]](#cite_note-NICE_adult_2021-47) [[48]](#cite_note-Canada_Health_ASD_2018-48) There are many signs associated with autism; the presentation varies widely: [[49]](#cite_note-Canada_Health_ASD_2018_signs-49) [[50]](#cite_note-CDC_Autism_2020-50) Common signs for autistic spectrum disorder - avoidance of eye-contact - little or no babbling as an infant - not showing interest in indicated objects [delayed language skills](/wiki/Language_disorder#Autism_spectrum_disorder)(e.g. having a smaller vocabulary than peers or difficulty expressing themselves in words) - reduced interest in other children or caretakers, possibly with more interest in objects - difficulty playing reciprocal games (e.g. peek-a-boo) - hyper- or hypo-sensitivity to or unusual response to the smell, texture, sound, taste, or appearance of things - resistance to changes in routine - repetitive, limited, or otherwise unusual usage of toys (e.g. lining up toys) - repetition of words or phrases ( [echolalia](/wiki/Echolalia)) - repetitive motions or movements, including [stimming](/wiki/Stimming) [self-harming](/wiki/Self-harm#Mental_disorder) Broader autism phenotype The broader autism [phenotype](/wiki/Phenotype) (BAP) describes people who may not have ASD but do have autistic [traits](/wiki/Phenotypic_trait), such as avoiding eye contact and [stimming](/wiki/Stimming). [[51]](#cite_note-51) Social and communication skills In social contexts, autistic people may respond and behave differently than people without ASD. [[52]](#cite_note-52) Impairments in social skills present many challenges for autistic people. Deficits in social skills may lead to problems with friendships, romantic relationships, daily living, and vocational success. [[53]](#cite_note-Barnhill_G._P._2007_116-126-53) One study that examined the outcomes of autistic adults found that, compared to the general population, autistic people were less likely to be married, but it is unclear whether this was because of deficits in social skills, intellectual impairment, or another reason. [[54]](#cite_note-54) One factor is likely [discrimination against autistic people](/wiki/Discrimination_against_autistic_people), which is perpetuated by myths\u2014for example, that they have no empathy. [[55]](#cite_note-55) [[56]](#cite_note-56) Until 2013, deficits in social function and communication were considered two separate symptom domains of autism. [[57]](#cite_note-57) The current social communication domain criteria for autism diagnosis require people to have deficits across three social skills: social-emotional reciprocity, nonverbal communication, and developing and sustaining relationships. [[38]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDSM-5-TR-38) A range of social-emotional reciprocity difficulties (a person's ability to naturally engage in social interactions) may be present. Autistic people may lack mutual sharing of interests; many autistic children prefer not to play or interact with others. They may lack awareness or understanding of other people's thoughts or feelings: a child may get too close to peers (entering their [personal space](/wiki/Proxemics)) without noticing that this makes them uncomfortable. They may also engage in atypical behaviors to gain attention: a child may push a peer to gain attention before starting a conversation. [[58]](#cite_note-UpToDate_Clinical_Features-58) Older autistic children and adults [perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition](/wiki/Face_perception#Autism) than non-autistic people, although this may be due to the prevalence of [alexithymia](/wiki/Alexithymia) in autistic people rather than autism itself. [[59]](#cite_note-59) Autistic people experience deficits in their ability to develop, maintain, and understand relationships, as well as difficulties adjusting behavior to fit social contexts. [[60]](#cite_note-60) ASD presents with impairments in [pragmatic communication](/wiki/Pragmatics) skills, such as difficulty initiating a conversation or failure to consider a listener's interests to sustain a conversation. [[58]](#cite_note-UpToDate_Clinical_Features-58)[ [verification needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability)] The ability to be focused exclusively on one topic in communication is known as [monotropism](/wiki/Monotropism), and can be compared to \" [tunnel vision](/wiki/Tunnel_vision)\". It is common for autistic people to communicate strong interest in a specific topic, speaking in lesson-like monologues about their passion instead of enabling reciprocal communication. [[61]](#cite_note-NIH2017Com-61) What may look like self-involvement or indifference to others stems from a struggle to recognize or remember that other people have their own personalities, perspectives, and interests. [[62]](#cite_note-iidc.indiana.edu-62) [[63]](#cite_note-Lawson_2001-63) Another difference in pragmatic communication skills is that autistic people may not recognize the need to control the volume of their voice in different social settings; for example, they may speak loudly in libraries or movie theaters. [[64]](#cite_note-Fusaroli_2017-64) Autistic people display atypical nonverbal behaviors or have difficulties with [nonverbal communication](/wiki/Nonverbal_communication). They may make infrequent [eye contact](/wiki/Eye_contact): an autistic person may not make eye contact when called by name, or may avoid eye contact with an observer. Aversion of gaze can also be seen in [anxiety disorders](/wiki/Anxiety_disorder), but poor eye contact in autistic children is not due to shyness or anxiety; rather, it is overall diminished in quantity. Autistic people may struggle with both production and understanding of facial expressions. They often do not know how to recognize emotions from others' facial expressions, or may not respond with appropriate facial expressions. They may have trouble recognizing subtle expressions of emotion and identifying what various emotions mean for the conversation. [[65]](#cite_note-65) [[61]](#cite_note-NIH2017Com-61) A defining feature is that autistic people have social impairments and often lack intuitions about others that many people take for granted. [Temple Grandin](/wiki/Temple_Grandin), an autistic woman involved in autism activism, described her inability to understand the [social communication](/wiki/Communication) of [neurotypicals](/wiki/Neurotypical), or people with typical [neural development](/wiki/Development_of_the_nervous_system), as leaving her feeling \"like an anthropologist on Mars\". [[66]](#cite_note-66) They may also not pick up on [body language](/wiki/Body_language) or social cues such as eye contact and facial expressions if they provide more information than the person can process at that time. They struggle with understanding the context and subtext of conversational or printed situations, and have trouble forming resulting conclusions about the content. This also results in a lack of social awareness and atypical language expression. [[62]](#cite_note-iidc.indiana.edu-62) How facial expressions differ between those on the autism spectrum and neurotypical people is not clear. [[67]](#cite_note-67) Further, at least half of autistic children have unusual [prosody](/wiki/Prosody_(linguistics)). [[64]](#cite_note-Fusaroli_2017-64) Autistic people may also experience difficulties with verbal communication. Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of [babbling](/wiki/Babbling), unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words ( [echolalia](/wiki/Echolalia)). [[68]](#cite_note-Tager-Flusberg-68) [Joint attention](/wiki/Joint_attention) seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish autistic infants. [[69]](#cite_note-John2007-69) For example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the object to which the hand is pointing, [[70]](#cite_note-Volkmar-70) [[68]](#cite_note-Tager-Flusberg-68) and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. [[69]](#cite_note-John2007-69) Autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language. [[68]](#cite_note-Tager-Flusberg-68) Some autistic linguistic behaviors include repetitive or rigid language, and restricted interests in conversation. For example, a child might repeat words or insist on always talking about the same subject. [[58]](#cite_note-UpToDate_Clinical_Features-58) Echolalia may also be present in autistic people, for example by responding to a question by repeating the inquiry instead of answering. [[61]](#cite_note-NIH2017Com-61) Language impairment is also common in autistic children, but is not part of a diagnosis. [[58]](#cite_note-UpToDate_Clinical_Features-58) Many autistic children develop language skills at an uneven pace where they easily acquire some aspects of communication, while never fully developing others, [[61]](#cite_note-NIH2017Com-61) such as in some cases of [hyperlexia](/wiki/Hyperlexia). Some people remain [completely nonverbal](/wiki/Nonverbal_autism) throughout their lives. The CDC estimated that around 40% of autistic children do not speak at all, although the accompanying levels of literacy and nonverbal communication skills vary. [[71]](#cite_note-71) Restricted and repetitive behaviors ASD includes a wide variety of characteristics. Some of these include behavioral characteristics which widely range from slow development of social and learning skills to difficulties creating connections with other people. Autistic people may experience these challenges with forming connections due to anxiety or depression, which they are more likely to experience, and as a result isolate themselves. [[72]](#cite_note-72)[ [medical citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine))] Other behavioral characteristics include abnormal responses to sensations (such as sights, sounds, touch, taste and smell) and problems keeping a consistent speech rhythm. The latter problem influences social skills, leading to potential problems in understanding by communication partners. Autistic people's behavioral characteristics typically influence development, language, and social competence. Their behavioral characteristics can be observed as perceptual disturbances, disturbances of development rate, relating, speech and language, and motility. [[73]](#cite_note-73) The second core symptom of autism spectrum is a pattern of restricted and repetitive behaviors, activities, and interests. In order to be diagnosed with ASD under the DSM-5-TR, a person must have at least two of the following behaviors: [[38]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDSM-5-TR-38) [[74]](#cite_note-Lord_2018-74) [Repetitive behaviors](/wiki/Stimming)- Repetitive behaviors such as rocking, hand flapping, finger flicking, head banging, or repeating phrases or sounds. [[58]](#cite_note-UpToDate_Clinical_Features-58)These behaviors may occur constantly or only when the person gets stressed, anxious or upset. These behaviors are also known as stimming. - Resistance to change - A strict adherence to routines such as eating certain foods in a specific order or taking the same path to school every day. [[58]](#cite_note-UpToDate_Clinical_Features-58)The person may become distressed if there is a change or disruption to their routine. - Restricted interests - An excessive interest in a particular activity, topic, or hobby, and devoting all their attention to it. For example, young children might completely focus on things that spin and ignore everything else. Older children might try to learn everything about a single topic, such as the weather or sports, and [perseverate](/wiki/Perseveration)or talk about it constantly. [[58]](#cite_note-UpToDate_Clinical_Features-58) - Sensory reactivity - An unusual reaction to certain sensory inputs such as having a negative reaction to specific sounds or textures, being fascinated by lights or movements or having an apparent indifference to pain or heat. [[75]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDSM-5-TR\"Hyper-_or_hyporeactivity_to_sensory_input_or_unusual_interest_in_sensory_aspects_of_the_environment_(e.g.,_apparent_indifference_to_pain/temperature,_adverse_response_to_specific_sounds_or_textures,_excessive_smelling_or_touching_of_objects,_visual_fascination_with_lights_or_movement)\"-75) Autistic people can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) categorizes as follows. [[76]](#cite_note-Lam-Aman-76) [Stereotyped behaviors](/wiki/Stereotypy): Repetitive movements, such as hand flapping, head rolling, or body rocking. [Compulsive behaviors](/wiki/Compulsive_behavior): Time-consuming behaviors intended to reduce anxiety, that a person feels compelled to perform repeatedly or according to rigid rules, such as placing objects in a specific order, checking things, or handwashing. - Sameness: Resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted. [Ritualistic behavior](/wiki/Ritual#Psychology): Unvarying pattern of daily activities, such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual. This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors. [[76]](#cite_note-Lam-Aman-76) - Restricted interests: Interests or fixations that are abnormal in theme or intensity of focus, such as preoccupation with a single television program, toy, or game. [Self-injury](/wiki/Self-harm): Behaviors such [Self-injurious behaviors](/wiki/Self-injurious_behavior) (SIB) in and can include head-banging, self-cutting, self-biting, and hair-pulling. [[77]](#cite_note-Mins2014-77) Some of these can result in serious injury or death. [[77]](#cite_note-Mins2014-77) Following are theories about the cause of self-injurious behavior in children with developmental delay, including autistic children: [[78]](#cite_note-Oliver2015-78) - Frequency and/or continuation of self-injurious behavior can be influenced by environmental factors (e.g. reward in return for halting self-injurious behavior). This theory does not apply to younger children with autism. There is some evidence that frequency of self-injurious behavior can be reduced by removing or modifying environmental factors that reinforce the behavior. [[78]](#cite_note-Oliver2015-78): 10-12 - Higher rates of self-injury are also noted in socially isolated people with autism. Studies have shown that socialization skills are related factors to self-injurious behavior for people with autism. [[79]](#cite_note-79) - Self-injury could be a response to modulate [pain perception](/wiki/Nociception)when chronic pain or other health problems that cause pain are present. [[78]](#cite_note-Oliver2015-78): 12-13 - An abnormal [basal ganglia](/wiki/Basal_ganglia)connectivity may predispose to self-injurious behavior. [[78]](#cite_note-Oliver2015-78): 13 The suicide rate for verbal autistics is nine times that of the general population. [[80]](#cite_note-auto-80) Other features Autistic people may have symptoms that do not contribute to the official diagnosis, but that can affect the person or the family. [[81]](#cite_note-Filipek-81) - Some people with ASD show unusual or notable abilities, ranging from [splinter skills](/wiki/Splinter_skill)(such as the memorization of trivia) to rare talents in mathematics, music, or artistic reproduction, which in exceptional cases are considered a part of the [savant syndrome](/wiki/Savant_syndrome). [[82]](#cite_note-82) [[83]](#cite_note-Yu_&_Han_2018-83) [[84]](#cite_note-Molecular_Autism_2018-84)One study describes how some people with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention relative to the general population. [[85]](#cite_note-85) [Sensory](/wiki/Sensory_nervous_system)abnormalities are found in over 90% of autistic people, and are considered core features by some. [[86]](#cite_note-Geschwind-2009-86) - More generally, autistic people tend to show a \"spiky skills profile\", with strong abilities in some areas contrasting with much weaker abilities in others. [[87]](#cite_note-87) - Differences between the previously recognized disorders under the autism spectrum are greater for under-responsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud noises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements). [[88]](#cite_note-88)An estimated 60-80% of autistic people have motor signs that include [poor tone](/wiki/Hypotonia), [poor motor planning](/wiki/Apraxia), and [toe walking](/wiki/Toe_walking); [[86]](#cite_note-Geschwind-2009-86) [[89]](#cite_note-Gargot2022-89)deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper. [[90]](#cite_note-90) [[91]](#cite_note-91) [Pathological demand avoidance](/wiki/Pathological_demand_avoidance)can occur. People with this set of autistic symptoms are more likely to refuse to do what is asked or expected of them, even to activities they enjoy. - Unusual or atypical eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD, to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator. [[81]](#cite_note-Filipek-81)Selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur. [[92]](#cite_note-Dominick-92) Possible causes Exactly what causes autism remains unknown. [[93]](#cite_note-93) [[94]](#cite_note-94) [[95]](#cite_note-95) [[96]](#cite_note-96) It was long mostly presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for the social and non-social components of ASD's symptoms, described as a triad in the classic autism criteria. [[97]](#cite_note-Fractionable-97) But it is increasingly suspected that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often cooccur. [[97]](#cite_note-Fractionable-97) [[98]](#cite_note-HappeTime-98) While it is unlikely that ASD has a single cause, [[98]](#cite_note-HappeTime-98) many risk factors identified in the research literature may contribute to ASD development. These include genetics, prenatal and perinatal factors (meaning factors during pregnancy or very early infancy), [neuroanatomical](/wiki/Neuroanatomy) abnormalities, and environmental factors. It is possible to identify general factors, but much more difficult to pinpoint specific ones. Given the current state of knowledge, prediction can only be of a global nature and therefore requires the use of general markers. [[99]](#cite_note-Tager-Flusberg_2010-99) Biological subgroups Research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population [[100]](#cite_note-100) and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of [psychiatry](/wiki/Psychiatry), [psychology](/wiki/Psychology), [neurology](/wiki/Neurology) and [pediatrics](/wiki/Pediatrics). tensor imaging](/wiki/Diffusion_tensor_imaging) can help identify biologically relevant [phenotypes](/wiki/Phenotype) (observable traits) that can be viewed on [brain scans](/wiki/Neuroimaging), to help further [neurogenetic](/wiki/Neurogenetics) studies of autism; [[102]](#cite_note-102) one example is lowered activity in the [fusiform face area](/wiki/Fusiform_face_area) of the brain, which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects. [[103]](#cite_note-Levy_2009-103) It has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior. [[104]](#cite_note-104) (For more, see [Brett Abrahams](/wiki/Brett_Abrahams).) Syndromic autism and non-syndromic autism Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be classified into two categories: \"syndromic autism\" and \"non-syndromic autism.\" Syndromic autism refers to cases where ASD is one of the characteristics associated with a broader medical condition or [syndrome](/wiki/Syndrome), representing about 25% of ASD cases. The causes of syndromic autism are often known, and monogenic disorders account for approximately 5% of these cases. Non-syndromic autism, also known as classic or idiopathic autism, represents the majority of cases, and its cause is typically polygenic and unknown. Genetics Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the [genetics of autism](/wiki/Heritability_of_autism) are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare [mutations](/wiki/Mutation) with major effects, or by rare multi-gene interactions of common genetic variants. [[106]](#cite_note-Abrahams-106) [[107]](#cite_note-107) Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and [epigenetic](/wiki/Epigenetics) factors which do not change [DNA](/wiki/DNA) sequencing but are heritable and influence [gene expression](/wiki/Gene_expression). [[108]](#cite_note-Rapin-108) Many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected people and their parents. [[109]](#cite_note-SandersHe2015-109) But most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified. Typically, autism cannot be traced to a [Mendelian](/wiki/Mendelian_inheritance) (single-gene) mutation or to a single [chromosome abnormality](/wiki/Chromosome_abnormality), and none of the genetic syndromes associated with ASD have been shown to selectively cause ASD. [[106]](#cite_note-Abrahams-106) Numerous genes have been found, with only small effects attributable to any particular gene. [[106]](#cite_note-Abrahams-106) Most loci individually explain less than 1% of cases of autism. [[110]](#cite_note-110) As of 2018 [[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Autism_spectrum&action=edit), it appeared that between 74% and 93% of ASD risk is heritable. [[74]](#cite_note-Lord_2018-74) After an older child is diagnosed with ASD, 7% to 20% of subsequent children are likely to be as well. [[74]](#cite_note-Lord_2018-74) If parents have one autistic child, they have a 2% to 8% chance of having a second child who is autistic. If the autistic child is an identical twin, the other will be affected 36% to 95% of the time. A fraternal twin is affected up to 31% of the time.[ [medical citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine))] The large number of autistic people with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous [structural variation](/wiki/Structural_variation), such as [deletions](/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)), [duplications](/wiki/Gene_duplication) or [inversions](/wiki/Chromosomal_inversion) in genetic material during [meiosis](/wiki/Meiosis). [[111]](#cite_note-111) [[112]](#cite_note-112) Hence, a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited: that is, the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome. [[113]](#cite_note-Beaudet2-113)[ [verification needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability)] As of 2018 [[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Autism_spectrum&action=edit), understanding of genetic risk factors had shifted from a focus on a few [alleles](/wiki/Allele) to an understanding that genetic involvement in ASD is probably diffuse, depending on a large number of variants, some of which are common and have a small effect, and some of which are rare and have a large effect. The most common gene disrupted with large effect rare variants appeared to be [CHD8](/wiki/CHD8), but less than 0.5% of autistic people have such a mutation. The gene CHD8 encodes the protein chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 8, which is a [chromatin](/wiki/Chromatin) regulator enzyme that is essential during fetal development, CHD8 is an ATP dependent enzyme. [[114]](#cite_note-Nishiyama_172-182-114) [[115]](#cite_note-Ronan_347-359-115) [[116]](#cite_note-Thompson_3894-3904-116) The protein contains an Snf2 helicase domain that is responsible for the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP. [[116]](#cite_note-Thompson_3894-3904-116) CHD8 encodes for a DNA helicase that function as a transcription repressor by remodeling chromatin structure by altering the position of nucleosomes. CHD8 negatively regulates Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling is important in the vertebrate early development and morphogenesis. It is believed that CHD8 also recruits the linker histone H1 and causes the repression of -catenin and p53 target genes. [[114]](#cite_note-Nishiyama_172-182-114) The importance of CHD8 can be observed in studies where CHD8-knockout mice died after 5.5 embryonic days because of widespread p53 induced apoptosis. Some studies have determined the role of CHD8 in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). CHD8 expression significantly increases during human mid-fetal development. [[114]](#cite_note-Nishiyama_172-182-114) The chromatin remodeling activity and its interaction with transcriptional regulators have shown to play an important role in ASD [aetiology](/wiki/Etiology). [[115]](#cite_note-Ronan_347-359-115) The developing mammalian brain has a conserved CHD8 target regions that are associated with ASD risk genes. [[117]](#cite_note-117) The knockdown of CHD8 in human neural stem cells results in dysregulation of ASD risk genes that are targeted by CHD8. [[118]](#cite_note-118) Recently CD8 has been associated to the regulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), [[119]](#cite_note-119) and the regulation of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) initiation, via regulation of Xist long non-coding RNA,[ [ambiguous](/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify)] the master regulator of XCI,[ [ambiguous](/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify)] though competitive binding to Xist regulatory regions. [[120]](#cite_note-120) Some ASD is associated with clearly genetic conditions, like [fragile X syndrome](/wiki/Fragile_X_syndrome); however, only around 2% of autistic people have fragile X. [[74]](#cite_note-Lord_2018-74) Hypotheses from [evolutionary psychiatry](/wiki/Evolutionary_psychiatry) suggest that these genes persist because they are linked to human inventiveness, intelligence or systemising. [[121]](#cite_note-121) [[122]](#cite_note-122) Current research suggests that genes that increase susceptibility to ASD are ones that control [protein synthesis](/wiki/Protein_biosynthesis) in [neuronal cells](/wiki/Neuron) in response to cell needs, activity and adhesion of neuronal cells, [synapse](/wiki/Synapse) formation and remodeling, and excitatory to inhibitory [neurotransmitter](/wiki/Neurotransmitter) balance. Therefore, although up to 1,000 different genes are thought to increase the risk of ASD, all of them eventually affect normal neural development and connectivity between different functional areas of the brain in a similar manner that is characteristic of an ASD brain. Some of these genes are known to modulate production of the [GABA](/wiki/Gamma-Aminobutyric_acid) neurotransmitter, the nervous system's main inhibitory neurotransmitter. These GABA-related genes are under-expressed in an ASD brain. On the other hand, genes controlling expression of [glial](/wiki/Glia) and immune cells in the brain, e.g. [astrocytes](/wiki/Astrocyte) and [microglia](/wiki/Microglia), respectively, are over-expressed, which correlates with increased number of glial and immune cells found in postmortem ASD brains. Some genes under investigation in ASD pathophysiology are those that affect the [mTOR](/wiki/MTOR) signaling pathway, which supports cell growth and survival. [[123]](#cite_note-Chen2015-123) All these genetic variants contribute to the development of the autistic spectrum, but it cannot be guaranteed that they are determinants for the development. [[124]](#cite_note-124) ASD may be under-diagnosed in women and girls due to an assumption that it is primarily a male condition, [[125]](#cite_note-125) but genetic phenomena such as [imprinting](/wiki/Genomic_imprinting) and [X linkage](/wiki/Sex_linkage) have the ability to raise the frequency and severity of conditions in males, and theories have been put forward for a genetic reason why males are diagnosed more often, such as the [imprinted brain hypothesis](/wiki/Imprinted_brain_hypothesis) and the [extreme male brain theory](/wiki/Empathising%E2%80%93systemising_theory). [[126]](#cite_note-126) [[127]](#cite_note-127) [[128]](#cite_note-128) Early life Several prenatal and perinatal complications have been reported as possible risk factors for autism. These risk factors include maternal [gestational diabetes](/wiki/Gestational_diabetes), maternal and paternal age over 30, bleeding during pregnancy after the first trimester, use of certain prescription medication (e.g. [valproate](/wiki/Valproate)) during pregnancy, and [meconium](/wiki/Meconium) in the [amniotic fluid](/wiki/Amniotic_fluid). While research is not conclusive on the relation of these factors to autism, each of these factors has been identified more frequently in children with autism, compared to their siblings who do not have autism, and other typically developing youth. [[129]](#cite_note-Garder,_Spiegelman,_Buka-129) While it is unclear if any single factors during the prenatal phase affect the risk of autism, [[130]](#cite_note-Gardener_2009-130) complications during pregnancy may be a risk. [[130]](#cite_note-Gardener_2009-130) There are also studies being done to test whether certain types of regressive autism have an [autoimmune](/wiki/Autoimmunity) basis. [[131]](#cite_note-Stefanatos-131) Maternal nutrition and inflammation during preconception and pregnancy influences fetal neurodevelopment. [Intrauterine growth restriction](/wiki/Intrauterine_growth_restriction) is associated with ASD, in both term and preterm infants. [[132]](#cite_note-VohrPoggiDavis2017-132) Maternal inflammatory and [autoimmune diseases](/wiki/Autoimmune_disease) may damage fetal tissues, aggravating a genetic problem or damaging the nervous system. [[133]](#cite_note-SamsamAhangari2014-133) Exposure to air pollution during child pregnancy, especially [heavy metals](/wiki/Heavy_metals) and particulates, may increase the risk of autism. [[134]](#cite_note-134) [[135]](#cite_note-135) [Environmental factors](/wiki/Environmental_factor) that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods, [infectious diseases](/wiki/Infection), [solvents](/wiki/Solvent), [PCBs](/wiki/Polychlorinated_biphenyl), [phthalates](/wiki/Phthalate) disproven. [[137]](#cite_note-137) [[138]](#cite_note-138) [[139]](#cite_note-AFP20172-139) [[140]](#cite_note-140) Disproven vaccine hypothesis Parents may first become aware of ASD symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination. This has led to unsupported and disproven theories blaming [vaccine \"overload\"](/wiki/Vaccine_controversy#Vaccine_overload), the [vaccine preservative thiomersal](/wiki/Thiomersal_and_vaccines), [MMR vaccine](/wiki/MMR_vaccine_and_autism) for causing autism spectrum disorder. [[141]](#cite_note-GerberOffit2009-141) In 1998, British physician and academic [Andrew Wakefield](/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield) led a fraudulent, litigation-funded study that suggested that vaccine](/wiki/MMR_vaccine) may cause autism. [[142]](#cite_note-142) [[143]](#cite_note-143) [[144]](#cite_note-144) [[145]](#cite_note-145) [[146]](#cite_note-Godlee2011-146) Two versions of the vaccine causation hypothesis were that autism results from brain damage caused by either the MMR vaccine itself, or by [mercury](/wiki/Thiomersal) used as a vaccine preservative. [[147]](#cite_note-Tan_and_Parkin_2008-147) No convincing scientific evidence supports these claims. [[12]](#cite_note-:9-12) They are biologically implausible, [[141]](#cite_note-GerberOffit2009-141) and further evidence continues to refute them, including the observation that the rate of autism continues to climb despite elimination of thimerosal from most routine vaccines given to children from birth to 6 years of age. [[148]](#cite_note-148) [[149]](#cite_note-149) [[150]](#cite_note-150) [[151]](#cite_note-Waterhouse_2008-151) [[152]](#cite_note-152) A 2014 meta-analysis examined ten major studies on autism and vaccines involving 1.25 million children worldwide; it concluded that neither the vaccine preservative thimerosal ( [mercury](/wiki/Mercury_(element))), nor the MMR vaccine, which has never contained thimerosal, [[153]](#cite_note-153) lead to the development of ASDs. [[154]](#cite_note-Taylor_2014-154) Despite this, misplaced parental concern has led to lower rates of [childhood immunizations](/wiki/Childhood_immunizations), [outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases](/wiki/MMR_vaccine_and_autism#Disease_outbreaks) in some countries, and the preventable deaths of several children. [[155]](#cite_note-vaccines-155) [[156]](#cite_note-dublin-156) Etiological hypotheses Several hypotheses have been presented that try to explain how and why autism develops by integrating known causes (genetic and environmental effects) and findings (neurobiological and somatic). Some are more comprehensive, such as the Pathogenetic Triad, which proposes and operationalizes three core features (an autistic personality, cognitive compensation, neuropathological burden) that interact to cause autism, [[157]](#cite_note-Sarovic-157) and the [Intense World Theory](/wiki/Intense_World_Theory), which explains autism through a hyper-active neurobiology that leads to an increased perception, attention, memory, and emotionality. [[158]](#cite_note-Markram-158) There are also simpler hypotheses that explain only individual parts of the neurobiology or phenotype of autism, such as [mind-blindness](/wiki/Mind-blindness) (a decreased ability for [theory of mind](/wiki/Theory_of_mind)), the [weak central coherence theory](/wiki/Weak_central_coherence_theory), or the [extreme male brain](/wiki/Extreme_male_brain) and [empathising-systemising theory](/wiki/Empathising%E2%80%93systemising_theory). Evolutionary hypotheses Research exploring the [evolutionary](/wiki/Evolution) benefits of autism and associated genes has suggested that autistic people may have played a \"unique role in technological spheres and understanding of natural systems\" in the course of human development. [[159]](#cite_note-159) [[160]](#cite_note-160) It has been suggested that it may have arisen as \"a slight trade off for other traits that are seen as highly advantageous\", providing \"advantages in tool making and mechanical thinking\", with speculation that the condition may \"reveal itself to be the result of a [balanced polymorphism](/wiki/Balanced_polymorphism), like [sickle cell anemia](/wiki/Sickle_cell_anemia), that is advantageous in a certain mixture of genes and disadvantageous in specific combinations\". [[161]](#cite_note-161) In 2011, a paper in [Evolutionary Psychology](/wiki/Evolutionary_Psychology_(journal)) proposed that autistic traits, including increased abilities for spatial intelligence, concentration and memory, could have been [naturally selected](/wiki/Natural_selection) to enable self-sufficient [foraging](/wiki/Foraging) in a more (although not completely) solitary environment, referred to as the \"Solitary Forager Hypothesis\". [[162]](#cite_note-162) [[163]](#cite_note-163) [[164]](#cite_note-164) as \"an alternative [prosocial](/wiki/Prosocial_behavior) adaptive strategy\" which may have developed as a result of the emergence of \"collaborative morality\" in the context of small-scale [hunter-gathering](/wiki/Hunter-gatherer), i.e. where \"a positive social reputation for making a contribution to group wellbeing and survival\" becomes more important than complex social understanding. [[165]](#cite_note-165) Conversely, some multidisciplinary research suggests that [recent human evolution](/wiki/Recent_human_evolution) may be a driving force in the rise of a number of medical conditions in recent human populations, including autism. Studies in [evolutionary medicine](/wiki/Evolutionary_medicine) indicate that as biological evolution becomes outpaced by cultural evolution, disorders linked to bodily dysfunction increase in prevalence due to a lack of contact with pathogens and negative environmental conditions that once widely affected ancestral populations. Because natural selection primarily favors reproduction over health and longevity, the lack of this impetus to adapt to certain harmful circumstances creates a tendency for genes in descendant populations to over-express themselves, which may cause a wide array of maladies, ranging from [mental disorders](/wiki/Mental_disorder) to several personality traits/disorders. [[103]](#cite_note-Levy_2009-103) [Comorbidity](/wiki/Comorbidity) may increase with age and may worsen the course of youth with ASDs and make intervention and treatment more difficult. Distinguishing between ASDs and other diagnoses can be challenging because the traits of ASDs often overlap with symptoms of other disorders, and the characteristics of ASDs make traditional diagnostic procedures difficult. [[167]](#cite_note-Helverschou_2011-167) [[168]](#cite_note-Underwood_2010-168) Correlations Research [indicates that autistic people](/wiki/Autism_and_LGBT_identities) are significantly more likely to be [LGBT](/wiki/LGBT_community) than the general population. [[22]](#cite_note-Graham_Holmes-2022-22) There is tentative evidence that [gender dysphoria](/wiki/Gender_dysphoria) occurs more frequently in autistic people. [[169]](#cite_note-169) [[170]](#cite_note-170) A 2021 anonymized online survey of 16- to 90-year-olds revealed that autistic males are more likely to identify as bisexual, while autistic females are more likely to identify as homosexual. [[171]](#cite_note-171) People on the autism spectrum are significantly more likely to be [non-theistic](/wiki/Nontheism) than members of the general population. [[23]](#cite_note-:42-23) Comorbidities - The most common medical condition occurring in people with ASDs is seizure disorder or [epilepsy](/wiki/Epilepsy), which occurs in 11-39% of autistic people. [[172]](#cite_note-Ballaban-Gill_&_Tuchman-172)The risk varies with age, cognitive level, and type of [language disorder](/wiki/Language_disorder). [[173]](#cite_note-173) [Tuberous sclerosis](/wiki/Tuberous_sclerosis), an [autosomal dominant](/wiki/Dominance_(genetics))genetic condition in which non-malignant tumors grow in the brain and on other vital organs, is present in 1-4% of people with ASDs. [[174]](#cite_note-Wiznitzer-174) [Intellectual disabilities](/wiki/Intellectual_disability)are some of the most common comorbid disorders with ASDs. As diagnosis is increasingly being given to people with higher functioning autism, there is a tendency for the proportion with comorbid intellectual disability to decrease over time. In a 2019 study, it was estimated that approximately 30-40% of people diagnosed with ASD also have intellectual disability. [[175]](#cite_note-175)Recent research has suggested that autistic people with intellectual disability tend to have rarer, more harmful, genetic mutations than those found in people solely diagnosed with autism. [[176]](#cite_note-176)A number of genetic syndromes causing intellectual disability may also in people with an ASD. Approximately 25-75% of people with an ASD also have some degree of a learning disability. [[182]](#cite_note-Obrien_&_Pearson-182) - Various [anxiety disorders](/wiki/Anxiety_disorder)tend to co-occur with ASDs, with overall comorbidity rates of 7-84%. [[183]](#cite_note-Mash_&_Barkley-183)They are common among children with ASD; there are no firm data, but studies have reported prevalences ranging from 11% to 84%. Many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by ASD itself, or are hard to distinguish from ASD's symptoms. [[184]](#cite_note-184) - Rates of comorbid [depression](/wiki/Depression_(mood))in people with an ASD range from 4-58%. [[185]](#cite_note-Lainhart-185) - The relationship between ASD and [schizophrenia](/wiki/Schizophrenia)remains a controversial subject under continued investigation, and recent [meta-analyses](/wiki/Meta-analysis)have examined genetic, environmental, infectious, and immune risk factors that may be shared between the two conditions. [[186]](#cite_note-186) play a role in the aetiopathology of both ASD and schizophrenia. [[189]](#cite_note-189) - Deficits in ASD are often linked to behavior problems, such as difficulties following directions, being cooperative, and doing things on other people's terms. [[190]](#cite_note-Tsakanikos_2007-190)Symptoms similar to those of [attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder)(ADHD) can be part of an ASD diagnosis. [[191]](#cite_note-Rommelse_et_al.-191) [Sensory processing disorder](/wiki/Sensory_processing_disorder)is also comorbid with ASD, with comorbidity rates of 42-88%. [[192]](#cite_note-Baranek_2002-192) - Starting in adolescence, some people with Asperger syndrome (26% in one sample) [[193]](#cite_note-:17-193)fall under the criteria for the similar condition [schizoid personality disorder](/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder), which is characterized by a [lack of interest in social relationships](/wiki/Asociality), a tendency towards a solitary or sheltered lifestyle, secretiveness, emotional coldness, detachment and [apathy](/wiki/Apathy). [[193]](#cite_note-:17-193) [[194]](#cite_note-:16-194) [[195]](#cite_note-:5-195)Asperger childhood.\" [Genetic disorders](/wiki/Genetic_disorder)- about 10-15% of autism cases have an [Mendelian](/wiki/Mendelian)(single-gene) condition, [chromosome abnormality](/wiki/Chromosome_abnormality), or other genetic syndromes. [[196]](#cite_note-196) - Several [metabolic defects](/wiki/Inborn_errors_of_metabolism), such as autistic symptoms. [[197]](#cite_note-Manzi-197)[ [verification needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability)] [Gastrointestinal problems](/wiki/Gastrointestinal_diseases)are one of the most commonly [co-occurring medical conditions](/wiki/Conditions_comorbid_to_autism_spectrum_disorders)in autistic people. [[198]](#cite_note-IsraelyanMargolis2018-198)These are linked to greater social impairment, irritability, language impairments, mood changes, and behavior and sleep problems. [[198]](#cite_note-IsraelyanMargolis2018-198) [[199]](#cite_note-WasilewskaKlukowski2015-199) [[200]](#cite_note-RaoGershon2016-200)A 2015 review proposed that immune, [gastrointestinal](/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract)inflammation, malfunction the [autonomic nervous system](/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system), [gut flora](/wiki/Gut_microbiota)alterations, and food [metabolites](/wiki/Metabolite)may cause brain neuroinflammation and dysfunction. [[199]](#cite_note-WasilewskaKlukowski2015-199)A 2016 review concludes that [enteric nervous system](/wiki/Enteric_nervous_system)abnormalities might play a role in neurological disorders such as autism. Neural connections and the immune system are a pathway that may allow diseases originated in the intestine to spread to the brain. [[200]](#cite_note-RaoGershon2016-200) - Sleep problems affect about two-thirds of people with ASD at some point in childhood. These most commonly include symptoms of [insomnia](/wiki/Insomnia), such as difficulty falling asleep, frequent [nocturnal awakenings](/wiki/Middle-of-the-night_insomnia), and early morning awakenings. Sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress, and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary ASD diagnosis. [[201]](#cite_note-201) Management There is no treatment as such for autism, [[202]](#cite_note-202) and many sources advise that this is not an appropriate goal, [[203]](#cite_note-203) [[204]](#cite_note-204) although treatment of co-occurring conditions remains an important goal. [[205]](#cite_note-205) There is no cure for autism as of 2023, nor can any of the known treatments significantly reduce brain mutations caused by autism, although those who require little to no support are more likely to experience a lessening of symptoms over time. [[206]](#cite_note-McPartland-206) [[207]](#cite_note-Woodbury-Smith-207) [[208]](#cite_note-Coplan-208) Several interventions can help children with autism, [[209]](#cite_note-HHS2017-209) and no single treatment is best, with treatment typically tailored to the child's needs. [[210]](#cite_note-Myers_2007-210) Studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about [efficacy](/wiki/Efficacy), [[211]](#cite_note-211) but the development of evidence-based interventions has advanced. [[212]](#cite_note-:06-212) The main goals of treatment are to lessen associated deficits and family distress, and to increase [quality of life](/wiki/Quality_of_life) and functional independence. In general, higher [IQs](/wiki/Intelligence_quotient) are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes. [[213]](#cite_note-213) [[214]](#cite_note-Smith-214) Behavioral, psychological, education, and/or skill-building interventions may be used to assist autistic people to learn life skills necessary for living independently, [[215]](#cite_note-215) as well as other social, communication, and language skills. Therapy also aims to reduce challenging behaviors and build upon strengths. [[216]](#cite_note-216) Intensive, sustained [special education](/wiki/Special_education) programs and behavior therapy early in life may help children acquire self-care, language, and job skills. [[210]](#cite_note-Myers_2007-210) Although evidence-based interventions for autistic children vary in their methods, many adopt a [psychoeducational](/wiki/Psychoeducation) approach to enhancing cognitive, communication, and social skills while minimizing problem behaviors. While medications have not been found to help with core symptoms, they may be used for associated symptoms, such as irritability, inattention, or repetitive behavior patterns. [[217]](#cite_note-Ji2015-217) Non-pharmacological interventions education](/wiki/Special_education) or [remedial education](/wiki/Remedial_education) programs and [behavior therapy](/wiki/Behaviour_therapy) early in life may help children acquire self-care, social, and job skills. Available approaches include [applied behavior analysis](/wiki/Applied_behavior_analysis), developmental models, [[219]](#cite_note-Myers-219) Among these approaches, interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively, or focus treatment on a specific area of deficit. [[214]](#cite_note-Smith-214) Generally, when educating those with autism, specific tactics may be used to effectively relay information to these people. Using as much social interaction as possible is key in targeting the inhibition autistic people experience concerning person-to-person contact. Additionally, research has shown that employing semantic groupings, which involves assigning words to typical conceptual categories, can be beneficial in fostering learning. [[220]](#cite_note-220) There has been increasing attention to the development of evidence-based interventions for autistic young children. Three theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include [applied behavior analysis](/wiki/Applied_behavior_analysis) (ABA), [the (CBT). [[218]](#cite_note-Wang_Zhao_Huang_Chen_2021_p.-218) [[214]](#cite_note-Smith-214) Although ABA therapy has a strong evidence base, particularly in regard to early intensive home-based therapy, ABA's effectiveness may be limited by diagnostic severity and IQ of the person affected by ASD. [[221]](#cite_note-221) The [Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology](/wiki/Journal_of_Clinical_Child_%26_Adolescent_Psychology) has published a paper deeming two early childhood interventions \"well-established\": individual comprehensive ABA, and focused teacher-implemented ABA combined with DSP. [[214]](#cite_note-Smith-214) Another [evidence-based](/wiki/Evidence-based_practice) intervention that has demonstrated efficacy is a parent training model, which teaches parents how to implement various ABA and DSP techniques themselves. [[214]](#cite_note-Smith-214) Various DSP programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at-home parent implementation. In October 2015, the [American Academy of Pediatrics](/wiki/American_Academy_of_Pediatrics) (AAP) proposed new evidence-based recommendations for early interventions in ASD for children under 3. [[222]](#cite_note-APP2015-222) These recommendations emphasize early involvement with both developmental and behavioral methods, support by and for parents and caregivers, and a focus on both the core and associated symptoms of ASD. [[222]](#cite_note-APP2015-222) However, a [Cochrane](/wiki/Cochrane_(organisation)) review found no evidence that early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) is effective in reducing behavioral problems associated with autism in most autistic children but did help improve IQ and language skills. [[223]](#cite_note-:4-223) The Cochrane review did acknowledge that this may be due to the low quality of studies currently available on EIBI and therefore providers should recommend EIBI based on their clinical judgement and the family's preferences. [[223]](#cite_note-:4-223) No adverse effects of EIBI treatment were found. [[223]](#cite_note-:4-223) A meta-analysis in that same database indicates that due to the degrees of severity in ASD, there is variable responses to differing early ABA interventions. [[224]](#cite_note-Cochrane-224) Generally speaking, treatment of ASD focuses on behavioral and educational interventions to target its two core symptoms: social communication deficits and restricted, repetitive behaviors. [[225]](#cite_note-:7-225) If symptoms continue after behavioral strategies have been implemented, some medications can be recommended to target specific symptoms or co-existing problems such as restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs), anxiety, depression, hyperactivity/inattention and sleep disturbance. [[225]](#cite_note-:7-225) [Melatonin](/wiki/Melatonin), for example, can be used for sleep problems. [[226]](#cite_note-226) While there are a number of parent-mediated behavioral therapies to target social communication deficits in children with autism, there is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of interventions to treat RRBs. [[227]](#cite_note-227) Education Educational interventions often used include [applied behavior analysis](/wiki/Applied_behavior_analysis) (ABA), developmental models, structured teaching, [speech and language therapy](/wiki/Speech_and_language_therapy) and [social skills](/wiki/Social_skills) therapy. [[210]](#cite_note-Myers_2007-210) Among these approaches, interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively, or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit. [[212]](#cite_note-:06-212) The quality of research for early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI)\u2014a treatment procedure incorporating over thirty hours per week of the [structured type of ABA](/wiki/Discrete_trial_training) that is carried out with very young children\u2014is low; more vigorous research designs with larger sample sizes are needed. [[223]](#cite_note-:4-223) Two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include [structured](/wiki/Discrete_trial_training) and [naturalistic](/wiki/Pivotal_response_treatment) ABA interventions, and developmental social pragmatic models (DSP). [[212]](#cite_note-:06-212) One interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model, which teaches parents how to implement various ABA and DSP techniques, allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves. [[212]](#cite_note-:06-212) Various DSP programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at-home parent implementation. Despite the recent development of parent training models, these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies, being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment. [[212]](#cite_note-:06-212) [Early, intensive ABA therapy](/wiki/Discrete_trial_training) has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing communication and adaptive functioning in preschool children; [[210]](#cite_note-Myers_2007-210) it is also well-established for improving the intellectual performance of that age group. [[210]](#cite_note-Myers_2007-210) A 2018 Cochrane meta-analysis database concludes how some recent research is beginning to suggest that because of the heterology of ASD, there is two varying ABA teaching approaches to acquiring [spoken language](/wiki/Spoken_language): children with more general [expressive language delays](/wiki/Expressive_language_disorder) respond sufficiently to the [naturalistic approach](/wiki/Pivotal_response_treatment), whereas children with [receptive language delays](/wiki/Mixed_receptive-expressive_language_disorder) require [discrete trial training](/wiki/Discrete_trial_training)\u2014a structured and intensive form of ABA. [[224]](#cite_note-Cochrane-224) Similarly, a teacher-implemented intervention that utilizes a more [naturalistic form of ABA](/wiki/Pivotal_response_treatment) combined with a developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be beneficial in improving social-communication skills in young children, although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms. [[212]](#cite_note-:06-212) Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators, resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided. [[229]](#cite_note-Kanne_2008-229) The appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers. [[230]](#cite_note-230) Pharmacological interventions Medications may be used to treat ASD symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails. [[231]](#cite_note-San2016-231) They may also be used for associated health problems, such as [ADHD](/wiki/ADHD) or [anxiety](/wiki/Anxiety_disorder). [[231]](#cite_note-San2016-231) However, their routine prescription for the core features of ASD is not recommended. [[232]](#cite_note-Siafis2022-232) More than half of US children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed [psychoactive drugs](/wiki/Psychoactive_drug) or [anticonvulsants](/wiki/Anticonvulsant), with the most common drug treating associated aggressive and self-injurious behaviors. [[217]](#cite_note-Ji2015-217) [[235]](#cite_note-235) But their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits, and autistic people may respond atypically. [[217]](#cite_note-Ji2015-217) Side effects may include weight gain, tiredness, drooling, and aggression. [[217]](#cite_note-Ji2015-217) There is some emerging data that show positive effects of [aripiprazole](/wiki/Aripiprazole) and [risperidone](/wiki/Risperidone) on restricted and repetitive behaviors (i.e., [stimming](/wiki/Stimming); e.g., flapping, twisting, complex whole-body movements), [[232]](#cite_note-Siafis2022-232) but due to the small sample size and different focus of these studies and the concerns about its side effects, antipsychotics are not recommended as primary treatment of RRBs. [[236]](#cite_note-236) [SSRI](/wiki/SSRI) antidepressants, such as [fluoxetine](/wiki/Fluoxetine) and [fluvoxamine](/wiki/Fluvoxamine), have been shown to be effective in reducing repetitive and ritualistic behaviors, while the stimulant medication [methylphenidate](/wiki/Methylphenidate) is beneficial for some children with co-morbid inattentiveness or hyperactivity. [[210]](#cite_note-Myers_2007-210) There is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD.[ [medical citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine))] No known medication relieves autism's core symptoms of social and communication impairments. [[217]](#cite_note-Ji2015-217) Alternative medicine A multitude of researched alternative therapies have also been implemented. Many have resulted in harm to autistic people. [[219]](#cite_note-Myers-219) A 2020 systematic review on adults with autism has provided emerging evidence for decreasing stress, anxiety, ruminating thoughts, anger, and aggression through [mindfulness](/wiki/Mindfulness)-based interventions for improving mental health. [[237]](#cite_note-237) Although popularly used as an [alternative treatment](/wiki/Alternative_medicine) for autistic people, as of 2018 [[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Autism_spectrum&action=edit) there is no good evidence to recommend a [gluten- and casein-free diet](/wiki/Gluten-free,_casein-free_diet) as a standard treatment. [[238]](#cite_note-GogouKolios2018-238) [[239]](#cite_note-MariBausetZazpe-239) [[240]](#cite_note-Millward2008-240) A 2018 review concluded that it may be a therapeutic option for specific groups of children with autism, such as those with known [food intolerances](/wiki/Food_intolerance) or [allergies](/wiki/Food_allergy), or with food intolerance markers. The authors analyzed the prospective trials conducted to date that studied the efficacy of the gluten- and casein-free diet in children with ASD (4 in total). All of them compared gluten- and casein-free diet versus normal diet with a control group (2 double-blind randomized controlled trials, 1 double-blind crossover trial, 1 single-blind trial). In two of the studies, whose duration was 12 and 24 months, a significant improvement in ASD symptoms (efficacy rate 50%) was identified. In the other two studies, whose duration was 3 months, no significant effect was observed. [[238]](#cite_note-GogouKolios2018-238) The authors concluded that a longer duration of the diet may be necessary to achieve the improvement of the ASD symptoms. [[238]](#cite_note-GogouKolios2018-238) Other problems documented in the trials carried out include transgressions of the diet, small sample size, the heterogeneity of the participants and the possibility of a [placebo](/wiki/Placebo) effect. [[240]](#cite_note-Millward2008-240) [[241]](#cite_note-HymanStewart2016-241) [[242]](#cite_note-Siafis2020-242) In the subset of people who have [gluten sensitivity](/wiki/Non-celiac_gluten_sensitivity) there is limited evidence that suggests that a [gluten-free diet](/wiki/Gluten-free_diet) may improve some autistic behaviors. [[243]](#cite_note-Buie-243) [[244]](#cite_note-VoltaCaio-244) [[245]](#cite_note-SanMauroGaricano-245) The preference that autistic children have for unconventional foods can lead to reduction in bone cortical thickness with this risk being greater in those on [casein-free diets](/wiki/Casein), as a consequence of the low intake of [calcium](/wiki/Calcium) and [vitamin D](/wiki/Vitamin_D); however, suboptimal bone development in ASD has also been associated with lack of exercise and [gastrointestinal disorders](/wiki/Gastrointestinal_disease). [[246]](#cite_note-TyeRunicles2018-246) In 2005, botched [chelation child with autism. [[247]](#cite_note-pmid18775371-247) [[248]](#cite_note-248) Chelation is not recommended for autistic people since the associated risks outweigh any potential benefits. [[249]](#cite_note-JamesStevenson2015-249) Another alternative medicine practice with no evidence is [CEASE therapy](/wiki/CEASE_therapy), a [pseudoscientific](/wiki/Pseudoscience) mixture of [homeopathy](/wiki/Homeopathy), supplements, and \"vaccine detoxing\". [[250]](#cite_note-250) Results of a systematic review on interventions to address health outcomes among autistic adults found emerging evidence to support [mindfulness](/wiki/Mindfulness)-based interventions for improving mental health. This includes decreasing stress, anxiety, ruminating thoughts, anger, and aggression. [[251]](#cite_note-:19-251) An updated Cochrane review (2022) found evidence that [music therapy](/wiki/Music_therapy) likely improves social interactions, verbal communication, and nonverbal communication skills. [[252]](#cite_note-252) There has been early research on [hyperbaric treatments](/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine) in children with autism. [[253]](#cite_note-253) Studies on pet therapy have shown positive effects. [[254]](#cite_note-254) Prevention While infection with [rubella](/wiki/Rubella) during pregnancy causes fewer than 1% of cases of autism, [[255]](#cite_note-Duchan-255) [vaccination against rubella](/wiki/Rubella_vaccine) can prevent many of those cases. [[256]](#cite_note-Lancet2015-256) Prognosis There is no evidence of a cure for autism. [[210]](#cite_note-Myers_2007-210) [[103]](#cite_note-Levy_2009-103) The degree of symptoms can decrease, occasionally to the extent that people lose their diagnosis of ASD; [[257]](#cite_note-Helt2008-257) [[258]](#cite_note-Fein2013-258) this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment [[259]](#cite_note-Orinstein2014-259) and sometimes not. It is not known how often this outcome happens, [[260]](#cite_note-Rogers-260) with reported rates in unselected samples ranging from 3% to 25%. [[257]](#cite_note-Helt2008-257) [[258]](#cite_note-Fein2013-258) Although core difficulties tend to persist, symptoms often become less severe with age. [[108]](#cite_note-Rapin-108) Acquiring language before age six, having an [IQ](/wiki/Intelligence_quotient) above 50, and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes; [independent living](/wiki/Independent_living) is unlikely in autistic people with higher support needs. [[261]](#cite_note-261) The prognosis of autism describes the [developmental course](/wiki/Prognosis_of_autism#Developmental_course), gradual autism development, regressive autism development, differential outcomes, [academic performance](/wiki/Prognosis_of_autism#Academic_performance) and [employment](/wiki/Prognosis_of_autism#Employment). Epidemiology The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates about 1 in 100 children had autism during the period from 2012 to 2021 as that was the average estimate in studies published during that period with a trend of increasing prevalence over time. However, the study's 1% figure may reflect an underestimate of prevalence in [low-](/wiki/Low-income_country) and [middle-income countries](/wiki/Middle-income_country). [[5]](#cite_note-Autism-5) [[262]](#cite_note-262) The number of people diagnosed has increased considerably since the 1990s, which may be partly due to increased recognition of the condition. [[263]](#cite_note-Russell_2021-263) While rates of ASD are consistent across cultures, they vary greatly by gender, with boys diagnosed far more frequently than girls: 1 in 70 boys, but only 1 in 315 girls at eight years of age. [[264]](#cite_note-CDC_2020-264) Girls, however, are more likely to have associated cognitive impairment, suggesting that less severe forms of ASD are likely being missed in girls and women. [[265]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEICD-11\"Females_diagnosed_with_autism_spectrum_disorder_are_more_frequently_diagnosed_with_co-occurring_disorders_of_intellectual_development,_suggesting_that_less_severe_presentations_may_go_undetected_as_compared_to_males\"-265) Prevalence differences may be a result of gender differences in expression of clinical symptoms, with [women and girls with autism](/wiki/Sex_differences_in_autism) showing less atypical behaviors and, therefore, less likely to receive an ASD diagnosis. [[266]](#cite_note-Tsakanikos_Underwood_2011-266) Using DSM-5 criteria, 92% of the children diagnosed per DSM-IV with one of the disorders which is now considered part of ASD will still meet the diagnostic criteria of ASD. However, if both ASD and the social (pragmatic) communication disorder categories of DSM-5 are combined, the [prevalence](/wiki/Prevalence) of autism is mostly unchanged from the prevalence per the DSM-IV criteria. The best estimate for prevalence of ASD is 0.7% or 1 child in 143 children. [[267]](#cite_note-267) Relatively mild forms of autism, such as Asperger's as well as other developmental disorders, are included in the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. [[268]](#cite_note-Baio2018-268) ASD rates were constant between 2014 and 2016 but twice the rate compared to the time period between 2011 and 2014 (1.25 vs 2.47%). A Canadian meta-analysis from 2019 confirmed these effects as the profiles of people diagnosed with autism became less and less different from the profiles of the general population. [[269]](#cite_note-269) In the US, the rates for diagnosed ASD have been steadily increasing since 2000 when records began being kept. [[270]](#cite_note-270) While it remains unclear whether this trend represents a true rise in incidence, it likely reflects changes in ASD diagnostic criteria, improved detection, and increased public awareness of autism. [[271]](#cite_note-271) In 2012, the [NHS](/wiki/National_Health_Service) estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the UK was 1.1%. [[272]](#cite_note-NHSEstimating-272) A 2016 survey in the United States reported a rate of 25 per 1,000 children for ASD. [[273]](#cite_note-273) Rates of autism are poorly understood in many low- and middle-income countries, which affects the accuracy of global ASD prevalence estimates, [[274]](#cite_note-274) but it is thought that most autistic people live in low- and middle-income countries. [[275]](#cite_note-:8-275) In 2020, the [Centers for Disease Control](/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control)'s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network reported that approximately 1 in 54 children in the United States (1 in 34 boys, and 1 in 144 girls) is diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), based on data collected in 2016. [[276]](#cite_note-CDC20-276) [[277]](#cite_note-277) This estimate is a 10% increase from the 1 in 59 rate in 2014, a 105% increase from the 1 in 110 rate in 2006, and a 176% increase from the 1 in 150 rate in 2000. [[276]](#cite_note-CDC20-276) Diagnostic criteria for ASD have changed significantly since the 1980s; for example, [U.S. special-education](/wiki/Special_education_in_the_United_States) autism classification was introduced in 1994. [[136]](#cite_note-Newschaffer_2007-136) In the UK, from 1998 to 2018, the autism diagnoses increased by 787%. [[263]](#cite_note-Russell_2021-263) This increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices, referral patterns, availability of services, age at diagnosis, and public awareness [[278]](#cite_note-Fombonne-2009-278) [[279]](#cite_note-279) [[280]](#cite_note-280) (particularly among women), [[263]](#cite_note-Russell_2021-263) though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out. [[281]](#cite_note-Rut2005-281) The available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism's true prevalence has increased; [[278]](#cite_note-Fombonne-2009-278) a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward psychosocial factors and changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics. [[282]](#cite_note-Szpir-282) It has been established that vaccination is not a risk factor for autism and is not a cause of any increase in autism prevalence rates, if any change in the rate of autism exists at all. [[154]](#cite_note-Taylor_2014-154) Males have higher likelihood of being diagnosed with ASD than females. The sex ratio averages 4.3:1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment: it may be close to 2:1 with intellectual disability and more than 5.5:1 without. [[136]](#cite_note-Newschaffer_2007-136) [Several theories](/wiki/Sex_differences_in_autism) about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated, but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed; [[283]](#cite_note-Chaste-283) one theory is that females are underdiagnosed. [[284]](#cite_note-284) The risk of developing autism is greater with older fathers than with older mothers; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm, and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism. [[27]](#cite_note-Geschwind-27) Most professionals believe that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism. [[285]](#cite_note-285) History Society and culture An autistic culture has emerged, accompanied by the [autistic rights](/wiki/Autism_rights_movement) and [neurodiversity](/wiki/Neurodiversity) movements, that argues autism should be accepted as a difference to be accommodated instead of cured, [[286]](#cite_note-286) [[287]](#cite_note-287) [[288]](#cite_note-Solomon-288) [[289]](#cite_note-289) [[290]](#cite_note-Silverman_2008-290) although a minority of autistic people might still accept a cure. [[291]](#cite_note-291) Worldwide, events related to autism include [World Autism Awareness Social-science scholars study those with autism in hopes to learn more about \"autism as a culture, transcultural comparisons ... and research on social movements.\" [[296]](#cite_note-296) Many autistic people have been successful in their fields. [[297]](#cite_note-297) Neurodiversity movement Some autistic people, as well as a growing number of researchers, [[13]](#cite_note-Pellicano-13) have advocated a [shift in attitudes](/wiki/Autism_rights_movement) toward the view that autism spectrum disorder is a difference, rather than a disease that must be treated or cured. [[298]](#cite_note-Clarke-298) [[299]](#cite_note-BaronCohen2002-299) Critics have bemoaned the entrenchment of some groups' opinions. [[300]](#cite_note-Solomon2-300) [[301]](#cite_note-:10-301) [[302]](#cite_note-:11-302) [[303]](#cite_note-303) [social movements](/wiki/Social_movement) within the context of [disability rights](/wiki/Disability_rights_movement), emphasizing the concept of [neurodiversity](/wiki/Neurodiversity), which describes the autism spectrum as a result of natural variations in the [human brain](/wiki/Human_brain) rather than a disorder to be cured. [[288]](#cite_note-Solomon-288) [[80]](#cite_note-auto-80) The autism rights movement advocates for including greater acceptance of autistic behaviors; therapies that focus on coping skills rather than imitating the behaviors of those without autism; [[304]](#cite_note-Bigthink-304) and the recognition of the autistic community as a [minority group](/wiki/Minority_group). [[304]](#cite_note-Bigthink-304) [[305]](#cite_note-Jaarsma2012-305) Autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural variation in the [human genome](/wiki/Human_genome). [[288]](#cite_note-Solomon-288) These movements are not without detractors; a common argument against neurodiversity activists is that most of them have relatively low support needs, or are [self-diagnosed](/wiki/Self-diagnosis), and do not represent the views of autistic people with higher support needs. [[305]](#cite_note-Jaarsma2012-305) [[306]](#cite_note-306) [[307]](#cite_note-307) Jacquiline den Houting explores this critique, determining that the voices of low-support needs autistics are \"some of the most influential within the neurodiversity movement, although admittedly these voices are a minority within the advocacy community\"; she suggests this is in part a shortcoming of the wider neurotypical community, the argument that only high-functioning autists should be included under the neurodiversity banner, as including low-functioning autists within this concept is deemed problematic, because their condition may rightfully be viewed as a disability. [[310]](#cite_note-310) The concept of neurodiversity is contentious in autism advocacy and research groups and has led to infighting. [[311]](#cite_note-311) [[312]](#cite_note-312) Symbols and flags Over the years, multiple organizations have tried to capture the essence of autism in symbols. In 1963, the board for the [National Autistic Society](/wiki/National_Autistic_Society), led by Gerald Gasson, proposed the \"puzzle piece\" as a symbol for autism, because it fit their view of autism as a \"puzzling condition\". [[313]](#cite_note-:15-313) In 1999, the [Autism Society](/wiki/Autism_Society_of_America) adopted the puzzle ribbon as the universal sign of autism awareness. [[313]](#cite_note-:15-313) In 2004, neurodiversity advocates Amy and Gwen Nelson conjured the \"rainbow infinity symbol\". It was initially the logo for their website, [Aspies for Freedom](/wiki/Aspies_For_Freedom). Nowadays, the prismatic colors are often associated with the neurodiversity movement in general. [[314]](#cite_note-:21-314) The autistic spectrum has also been symbolized by the infinity symbol itself. [[315]](#cite_note-315) In 2018, Julian Morgan wrote the article \"Light It Up Gold\", a response to Autism Speaks's \"Light It Up Blue\" campaign, launched in 2007. [[316]](#cite_note-316) [[317]](#cite_note-317) Aurum is Latin for gold, [[314]](#cite_note-:21-314) and gold has been used to symbolize autism, since both words start with \"Au\". Though a consensus for a flag to unite autism and neurodiversity has not yet been established, one has gained traction on Reddit. [[318]](#cite_note-318) The flag implements a gradient to represent the Pride Movement and incorporates a golden infinity symbol as its focal point. [[319]](#cite_note-319) While flags are symbols of solidarity, they may trigger negative associations, such as apparent rivalry among two or more flags. [[320]](#cite_note-320) For this reason, flags are sought that can be tailored to the personal preferences of any neurotype. [[321]](#cite_note-321) [[322]](#cite_note-322) - Autism - The [puzzle piece](/wiki/Jigsaw_puzzle)symbol as used in the autism awareness ribbon used by [Autism Speaks](/wiki/Autism_Speaks) Caregivers Families who care for an autistic child face added stress from a number of different causes. [[70]](#cite_note-Volkmar-70) [[323]](#cite_note-323) Parents may struggle to understand the diagnosis and to find appropriate care options. They often take a negative view of the diagnosis, and may struggle emotionally. [[324]](#cite_note-324) More than half of parents over age 50 are still living with their child, as about 85% of autistic people have difficulties living independently. [[325]](#cite_note-Kar2012-325) Some studies also find decreased earnings among parents who care for autistic children. [[326]](#cite_note-326) [[327]](#cite_note-327) Siblings of children with ASD report greater admiration and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children, like siblings of children with [Down syndrome](/wiki/Down_syndrome). But they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with Down syndrome; siblings of people with ASD have a greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults.
