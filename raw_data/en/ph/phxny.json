The funding was triggered as a result of to the 25,000+ Rhode Islanders who got vaccinated since the program was launched in July.

This is a powerful example of the community coming together keep each other healthy. If you have not gotten vaccinated yet, it is time.\" The RI Gives Vax Challenge encouraged Rhode Islanders to get vaccinated by awarding grants to nonprofits that supported the general COVID-19 response and recovery every time another 5,000 people were vaccinated. As a result of hitting the 20,000- and 25,000-vaccination milestones, another 38 nonprofits from across Rhode Island received $10,000 grants in the final phases of the initiative. \"This is just one more example of the remarkable way Rhode Islanders have pitched in over the past 17 months.

Steinberg, president and CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation. With the final rounds of grants, the Foundation has awarded $750,000 to 75 organizations in partnership with Governor McKee, the Rhode Island Commerce Department and the Rhode Island Department of Health. \"Getting vaccinated is how to help keep yourself and your family members safe from COVID-19, and it's also a way to support the critical network of organizations that have been supporting Rhode Islanders throughout this pandemic,\" said Nicole Alexander-Scott, MD, MPH, the Director of the Rhode Island Department of Health. \"The RI Gives Vax Challenge is an important part of our efforts to boost Rhode Island's COVID-19 vaccination rates, and to bolster the vital work of these community focused organizations throughout the state.\" The Boys & Girls Club of East Providence is one of the nonprofits that received a grant in the latest rounds of funding.
