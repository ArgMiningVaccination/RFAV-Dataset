History Implicit in Campbell University's motto, Ad Astra Per Aspera , to the stars through difficulties, adopted during the dark days of Reconstruction, are beliefs, aims, and objectives that have guided this institution through ever-changing circumstances Campbell's rise from a community school of 21 students to eminence as a great southern academy and later to its present standing among the state's largest church-related senior universities is illustrative of what perseverance can accomplish in scaling the heights. Campbell University was founded as Buies Creek Academy on January 5, 1887, by James Archibald Campbell, a North Carolina preacher who believed that no student should be denied admission because of lack of funds. In 1926, the school attained junior college status and changed its name from Buies Creek Academy to Campbell Junior College. In 1961, Campbell became a senior college. The name was changed to Campbell University on June 6, 1979. Graduate Programs begun in 1977, with the Master of Education degree. The Master of Science in Government was established in 1982. The Campbell University School of Law was founded in 1976, and the Lundy- Fetterman School of Business begun in 1983. The Schools of Pharmacy and Education were established in 1985. The Divinity School was established in 1996 In over 100 years of service, Campbell University has been served by only four presidents: James Archibald Campbell 1887-1934 Leslie Hartwell Campbell 1934-1967 Norman Adrian Wiggins 1967-2003 Jerry M.

The Department of Clinical Research supports the broad mission of Campbell University and the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences. Academic Programs The Department of Clinical Research offers a Bachelor and Master of Science in Clinical Research degrees as well as a minor. The Master of Science in Clinical Research degree is offered as an online program. The Clinical Research Program is located forty- five minutes from North Carolina's Research Triangle Park, one of the world's largest and most dynamic research centers. Many world- class research hospitals and organizations in this area look to Campbell's clinical research graduates when recruiting new talent. Bachelor of Science in Clinical Research (BSCR) The Bachelor of Science in Clinical Research degree is ideally suited to prepare students for entry-level jobs in the clinical research industry. Students in the program are required to complete an internship in the clinical research field, which provides them with networking opportunities, potential jobs, and experiential training. The department collaborates with sites primarily located throughout North Carolina and neighboring states to facilitate their placement. Students may choose an internship site based on their future career goals, including academics, clinical settings or research management sites. Many BSCR graduates gain employment as a direct result of their internship experience.Online Master of Science in Clinical Research (MSCR) The Master of Science in Clinical Research degree is an online program. The program is designed to educate students in literature evaluation, study design, research methodologies, data management, and statistical analysis and interpretation. The online environment offers enhanced interaction between peers, faculty and industry professionals. The MSCR program culminates with a research project based on the students' therapeutic interest. Students may work independently or collaborate with another MSCR student. The faculty serve as research project advisors throughout the entire research project experience. This degree prepares graduates to enter the field in positions including data managers, medical writers, clinical research monitors, study coordinators, regulatory affairs specialists, Institutional Review Board (IRB) administrators and project specialists. In addition, many graduates pursue professional degrees within the medical and health sciences fields. 4+1 Program The Department of Clinical Research provides an avenue for students to earn both their Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Clinical Research degrees. While the traditional time to earn both degrees is six years, the 4+1 program places students on a fast track toward completing two degrees in five years by utilizing two summer sessions. By virtue of pursuing both degrees, the program offers students a competitive edge in the job market and rapid career advancement. Clinical Research Minor Students pursuing degrees in multiple disciplines will benefit from additional education in Clinical Research to augment their major field of study. These disciplines/ programs include: Nursing, Biology, Chemistry, Exercise Science, Pre-Med, Pre-Law, Healthcare Management, Business Administration, and Psychology.

Applications for admission to the MSCR degree program are evaluated by the Department of Clinical Research's admissions committee. Acceptance into the graduate program is based on the overall record and ability of the applicant. There are three pathways to admissions to the MSCR program. Applicants may be considered in one of the following categories: 1. Graduate of a Bachelor's program These applicants are required to have completed their undergraduate degree, from a regionally accredited college or university, prior to matriculation and enrollment in any graduate coursework. Individuals may apply prior to completion of their undergraduate degree and gain acceptance contingent upon completion of the degree. 2.

Box 1090 Buies Creek, NC 27506 910-893-1940 Academic Program The Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree at Campbell University provides the students with the training and education necessary to enter the workforce as a registered nurse. The Essentials of Baccalaureate Education for Professional Nursing Practice [ American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) , 2008]; Nursing Scope and Standards of Practice (2010) and the regulations from the state of North Carolina provide the framework for the liberal arts and pre-licensure nursing education curriculum and the associated clinical experiences. The Essentials address the core knowledge required of nursing professionals and concepts of client centered care, interprofessional teams, evidence-based practice, quality improvement, patient safety, informatics, clinical reasoning, genetics, cultural sensitivity, professional values and practice across the life span. The College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences Department of Nursing is dedicated to helping students become the best healthcare professionals they can be by offering interprofessional education opportunities, top of the line training facilities, and first-hand experience with rural healthcare needs. Program Philosophy The mission of Campbell University and the Department of Nursing is to graduate students with exemplary academic and professional skills prepared for purposeful lives and meaningful service as beginning practitioners of nursing. We embrace the concept of a community of learning that is committed to the pursuit, discovery, and dissemination of knowledge. We believe that nursing is a practice discipline that relies on both science and art to provide care that addresses mind, body and spirit.We believe that: The concept of baccalaureate generalist education facilitates the integration of the roles of the nurse as: provider, designer/ manager/coordinator of quality, safe care and member of a profession practicing in a variety of healthcare settings. A learner-centered environment promotes independence, inquiry, and cultivates the relationship between theory, practice and research. The BSN graduate applies scientific principle, nursing process and evidence based practice to clinically reason caring practices that: promote health and well- being, prevent illness and injury across the lifespan in the care of diverse, underserved clients, families, groups and communities. The BSN graduate recognizes the value of interprofessional healthcare teams, lifelong learning, interdisciplinary collaboration, professional accountability and responsible use of resources. The BSN graduate embraces a holistic, comprehensive practice that includes the relationship between mind, body and spirit. Mission Statement The mission statement of the BSN program is consistent with the missions of Campbell University and CPHS. Our program mission contains and supports those aspects of the College and University to include leadership, advocacy, service, professionalism, critical inquiry, and interdisciplinary learning. The evidence for Christian principles are within the shared mission through patient-centered care, compassion, ethics, character, and respecting cultural differences. Vision Our graduates will meet future healthcare needs through the provision of safe, effective quality care, lead purposeful lives and provide meaningful service. Program Objectives Function effectively within nursing and interprofessional teams by fostering open communication, respect and shared decision-making to achieve quality outcomes in patient care.Collect, analyze, and synthesize data to make clinically-reasoned judgments about evidence-based interventions and evaluation of outcomes for the care of diverse, underserved clients, families, groups and communities. Assume accountability for quality and safety for one's own practice and delegated nursing care. Demonstrate knowledge of the influence of policy on social determinants of health and lifestyle variations for interventions related to health promotion, risk reduction and disease prevention for individuals, families, groups, communities and populations across the lifespan and across the continuum of healthcare. Use knowledge of organizations and systems leadership to design, manage, coordinate, collaborate and negotiate a plan of care with the client/family, interprofessional health care team, and to allocate physical, fiscal and human resources. Behavioral/Social Skills and Professionalism Students in the Campbell University BSN program must demonstrate attributes of empathy, compassion, integrity, collegiality, high moral character, excellent interpersonal communication, listening, and self- motivation; as such qualities are assessed throughout the program. Students must exhibit sound judgment in the care of patients and academic inquiry along with developing appropriate and effective patient relations. Flexibility and cultural sensitivity must be ensured during times of indecision as these occur frequently in clinical and academic settings. Additionally, students must be able to function in a collegial environment demonstrating proper levels of assertiveness, task delegation, along with organization and time management skills. Adequate emotional health is necessary to deal with strenuous environments and work effectively in demanding situations. Students must maintain good general health, self-care and hygiene throughout the program. 22 2014-2015 Academic Bulletin Campbell University, Department of Nursing and CPHS Guidelines The Pre-Nursing student accepts the latest published version of the Campbell University Bulletin Undergraduate Studies and is responsible for being completely familiar with the provisions therein.

Grading Scales Campbell Unviersity Dept. of Nursing A 90-100 A 93-100 B 80-89 85-92 D 68-74 F <60 F <67 1. Courses must be completed in the prescribed sequence and within 6 years of matriculation. 2. A student must earn a grade of 2.0 (75) in each nursing course. 3. Rounding of Grades- the calculation of a grade will be based on rounding a score ranging from number + 0.5 below the number to + .49 above the number to the common whole number. (Example: A grade of 75 = 74.5 through 75.49; 74 = 73.5 through 74.49) 4. In the clinical nursing courses (Fundamentals of Nursing Practice with Older Adults, Adult Health Nursing Practice I and II, Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing Practice, Population Health and the Focused Client Experience Practicum) 85% of the course is dependent on test/ examinations with 15% distribution among other assignments (papers, presentations, clinical paperwork). 5. A student must achieve an average grade of 75% on all test/examinations in order to successfully complete courses. If less than a 75% average is earned, the course grade is computed only on the test/examination average. If the 75% average is earned, all graded course requirements will be computed into the score. 6. A student earning a grade of less than 2.0 must repeat the course. If a student earns less than 2.0 or in a second nursing course, the student is dismissed from the program and is ineligible for readmission. A nursing course can be repeated one time only. 7.

Please refer to Student Handbook for the BSN Program or the CPHS Academic Bulletin for details. Reports on academic performance and progress are generated at the mid-term and completion of each semester. The BSN program core faculty meets at the end of each academic term, or as necessary, to discuss the academic performance of all students. Any discussions regarding type of academic deficiency and remedy occurs with development of an Academic Success Plan and draft of a letter from the program director stating the specific academic standing described in the following sections. The letter is provided to the student via email and hard copy by mail. The letter will contain the following: 1. Description of academic standing (remediation, probation, suspension, dismissal) 2. Rationale for academic standing 3. Criteria required to regain good academic standing 4. Contact information of the program director to discuss items outlined in the letter 5. Notification of appeals process 1. Good Academic Standing Students are considered in good academic standing providing: A semester GPA 75 or 2.0 average cumulative grade point (GPA) based on the BSN grading criteria Satisfactory evaluation on the Clinical Evaluation Tool for clinical experiences No violations of student Honor Code or Code of Conduct have occurred No occurrence of a patient safety violation2. Remediation Students who fail to meet academic standards within a given course or clinical experience rotation may be required to remediate coursework and/or attend another clinical. Students will require remediation for: Failure to achieve a semester GPA 75 or 2.0 average cumulative grade point (GPA) based on the BSN grading criteria A grade of D or F in any single course Students must initiate remediation with the Course Director should a grade of < 80% or failure on any examination within a given course. The course instructor and student document the content of remediation on the Academic Success Plan. Successful remediation must occur within the identified time frame or the student is placed on academic probation. Should a student fail to improve academic and/or behavioral performance issues, they will receive a failing grade for the course. This will necessitate a delay in the graduation date. Continuing Needs Improvement or Unsatisfactory ranking on the Clinical Evaluation Tool Violations of student Honor Code or Code of Conduct Any patient safety issue throughout the curriculum 3. Academic Probation Academic probation is the initial action for a student failing to make satisfactory academic progress following remediation interventions. A student will be placed on academic probation for: Inability to maintain a cumulative GPA of 75 or 2.0 based on the BSN grading criteria Failure to follow through with the Academic Success Plan (remediation) Continuing Needs Improvement or Unsatisfactory ranking on the Clinical Evaluation Tool A grade of D or F in any single course Repeated violations of the student Honor Code or Code of Conduct Violations of patient safety Accumulation of more than three Academic Success Plans in one semester A student placed on academic probation will remain so until the end of the semester. Students who fail to complete the criteria for lifting academic probation will be considered for suspension or dismissal from the BSN program. The BSN Curriculum Committee and program director, with notification to the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs, will recommend these actions. A recommendation will be made to the program director to restore good academic standing if: A semester GPA 75 or 2.0 average cumulative grade point (GPA) based on the BSN grading criteria is achieved The Academic Success Plan was followed with desired results achieved Satisfactory evaluation on the Clinical Evaluation Tool for clinical experiences No violations of student Honor Code or Code of Conduct have occurred No occurrence of a patient safety violation 4. Academic Suspension Academic Suspension from the BSN program and CPHS are imposed for a specified period of time and must not exceed one year. Suspension occurs when a student has academic deficiencies which preclude continuation in a normal program of study, but may be expected to be able to complete the requirements for the degree under a modified program of study with or without remedial courses. A student on academic suspension is not allowed to continue the standard course of study. The BSN Curriculum Committee and program director will specify the length of time of the suspension and remedial work required for reinstatement, with approval from the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs. 5. Academic Dismissal The BSN Curriculum Committee and program director may recommend academic dismissal to the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs under the following circumstances:. Fails to make satisfactory progress during the period of probation and or suspension A single egregious and/or knowing violation of patient safety, confidentiality, or professionalism Two semesters with the accumulation of three or more Academic Success Plans A student earning a grade of less than a 75 or 2.0 average cumulative grade point (GPA) based on the BSN grading criteria, must repeat the course. If a student earns less than 2.0 in a second nursing course, student dismissal occurs. This dismissal 26 2014-2015 Academic Bulletin results in being ineligible for readmission. A repeat of a nursing course occurs one time only. Unsatisfactory clinical performance constitutes a course failure and necessitates repeating the course, if eligible. If a student earns less than 2.0 in a second nursing course, student dismissal occurs. This dismissal results in being ineligible for readmission. A repeat of a nursing course occurs one time only. Academic Status Appeals At the end of each academic term, the BSN director will notify each student, the Academic Performance and Standards Committee chair and the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs of the BSN students that qualify for academic probation, suspension, or dismissal. The Academic Performance and Standards Committee (APSC) evaluate each student that is subject to suspension or dismissal in order to make a recommendation whether to retain or promote the student in the professional program. The student may appear in person before the committee. The chair of the APSC notifies students in writing regarding any decision by the committee to require a modified course of study, to suspend enrollment, or to dismiss the student from the College and informs the director of nursing, Associate Dean of Academic Affairs, and Associate Dean of Admissions & Student Affairs. Students have the opportunity to appeal any decision made by the APSC by submitting a written petition to the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs within seven days of their receipt of notification. The petition must contain the specific variance requested, a description of any extenuating circumstances intended to justify granting the variance, and a proposed course of study and/or conditions for consideration should the variance be granted. The decision of the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs is final. Please refer to Student Handbook for the BSN Program or the CPHS Academic Bulletin for details. Withdrawal A student may withdraw from a course without grade assignment at any time prior to the end of the fourth week of a semester. Withdrawal from a course after that period will result in a recorded grade. In the event a student must withdraw from the College, he or she will be responsible for obtaining the required form for withdrawal from the University Registrar. It is also the student's responsibility to complete the prescribed administrative procedures to assure notification to all individuals and offices that require this information. In cases of serious illness, injuries, or extreme circumstances which normally would require the student's withdrawal from the College, the student may fully withdraw from all semester coursework without receiving a grade. Such cases require adequate documentation of the circumstances and approval by program director. Delayed Graduation Policy If a nursing student is required to re-take classes as a result of specific course failure or a deficiency in overall academic performance, then a delay in scheduling nursing clinical experiences or matriculation through the curriculum will occur and the student's graduation may be delayed. Voluntary course withdrawals or a temporary leave of absence may cause a delay in scheduling clinical experiences, progress through the curriculum, and a subsequent delay in graduation. Any alteration in the normal curriculum progression may affect a student's financial aid status or qualification for education-based financial aid. For specific counseling and advice, students should contact the College's Office of Academic Affairs and the University's Office of Financial Aid. Attendance Attendance is mandatory for all class sessions and clinical experiences throughout the BSN curriculum. Repeated violations of unexcused absences are subject to consequences within the Student Honor Code. Please refer to Student Handbook for the BSN Program or the CPHS Academic Bulletin for details. Graduation Requirements Recommendation for graduation requires faculty approval and attainment of the following requirements: 1. Successful completion of all courses, requirements, and remediation 2. Successful completion of all clinical experiential training3. Attendance of graduation week activities that includes licensure preparation courses and comprehensive curriculum review 4. Attendance at the graduation ceremony is expected The BSN Upper Division Requirements for Graduation Completion of the nursing and general education courses prescribed by the faculty. Completion of nursing courses with a minimum grade of 2.0 (75) in each course Attainment of a minimum 2.0 cumulative GPA (see grading scale variation) 25% of semester credit hours in residence at Campbell University Attendance at the graduation ceremony is expected. A faculty vote is required to approve students for graduation. All BSN students are required to complete the BSN Exit Survey on-line in the fourth semester during the Focused Client Care Practicum. The Department of Nursing appoints a faculty advisor for each student to assist the student with program planning and tracking of prerequisites and upper division requirements. However, the responsibility for assuring that all requirements are met rests solely with the student.www .campbell.edu/cphs 27 NURSINGRegistered Nurse Licensure Exam Requirements The North Carolina Board of Nursing (NC - BON) uses the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX\u00ae) prepared by National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) to measure competence for entry-level prac - tice for graduates of Board-approved nursing education programs. The National Council of State Boards of Nursing has contracted with Pearson VUE to administer NCLEX\u00ae.For more detailed information about the NCLEX, please visit the National Council of State Boards of Nursing 's website. Eligibility requirements for examination: Completion of a member Board approved RN nursing education program Registration with Pearson Vue is required prior to the release of an Authorization to Test (ATT) All applicants must complete a criminal background check prior to the issuance of a license The Board of Nursing determines if the student with a prior criminal conviction is allowed to sit for the NCLEX-RN exam. Please note that conferring a degree to a student who has completed the curriculum does not guarantee that the Board of Nursing will issue an Authorization to Test.Curriculum The Essentials of Baccalaureate Education for Professional Nursing Practice [American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), 2008]; Nursing Scope and Standards of Practice (2010) provide the framework for the development of the liberal arts and pre-licensure nursing education curriculum and the associated clinical experiences. The Essentials address the core knowledge required of nursing professionals and concepts of client centered care, interprofessional teams, evidence-based practice, quality improvement, patient safety, informatics, clinical reasoning, genetics, cultural sensitivity, professional values and practice across the life span. The practice experience in the final two years enhances the connections with didactic content and facilitates growth across the curriculum. The rationale for sequencing of courses facilitates moving from the simple to the complex. Students begin their nursing courses by learning to assess and plan care for meeting basic needs of the independent community based adult followed by the nursing home resident at variable levels of required skill. Upon completion of the program, students are working as a team member to organize, implement, collaborate and evaluate nursing care for groups of clients/families, community groups and populations. The student evaluations demonstrate increasing expectations in clinical performance.

PharmCAS Applicants must submit an application through the Pharmacy College Application Service (PharmCAS) online at www. pharmcas.org. Original official transcripts from all US post-secondary schools (including the planned fall courses) and Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT) scores must be submitted to PharmCAS. All college coursework attempted must be submitted to PharmCAS. For applicants currently enrolled in classes, it is imperative to update newly completed coursework. When fall grades are available the applicant must submit official transcripts to PharmCAS in order to update their application. Transcripts reflecting spring grades must be sent directly to the CPHS Admissions Office. Applicants are also required to submit three letters of recommendations to PharmCAS. At least one letter from a science professor and a pharmacist is strongly preferred. Applicants gaining acceptance to the Doctor of Pharmacy program are required to submit to a urine drug screen and a criminal background check through the PharmCAS system. Results of these screens which violate policies and procedures of CPHS, Campbell University or one the affiliated institutions may have a negative impact on the candidate's ability to matriculate into the program.Supplemental Materials A supplemental application with the required application fee and passport size photograph must be submitted to CPHS. The supplemental application is available online at www.campbell.edu/cphs. Failure to complete the required supplemental components of the admissions process will delay the review of the application package until all elements are completed. Interviews Completed application packages are evaluated by the Admissions Committee to determine the applicant's potential as a student pharmacist. Based on this evaluation, an invitation to participate in a personal admissions interview may be extended. The interview is designed as a two-way exchange with the goal of mutually enhancing the understanding of both the applicant and the Admissions Committee. Applicants are notified by email of admissions decisions following the interview process. Early Decision Program An Early Decision Program is available for eligible applicants. Through this option, applicants select one school as their preference through PharmCAS. The college and the student have the potential to benefit from this program by confirming admissions and enrollment for qualified applicants early in the admissions process. To be eligible for the Early Decision Program, the applicant must complete the required eight semester hours of organic chemistry, the PCAT examination, a PharmCAS application along with three letters of recommendation, and the supplemental application with fee and photograph. All materials must be forwarded to the appropriate locations prior to the early decision deadline in order to be considered as an early decision candidate. A decision will be rendered by the deadline specified by PharmCAS. Valid admissions decisions for an early decision candidate consist of: acceptance, denial or deferral of the applicant to the general applicant pool (applicant becomes eligible to apply to other pharmacy programs while still being considered by their primary preference). Tuition and Fees Tuition and fees are determined annually, for more information visit www.campbell.edu/ cphs. Refund Policy An admissions deposit is required of each accepted applicant. These deposits are non-refundable. Additionally, no refunds are provided for students who attend any class and subsequently withdraw or are suspended from CPHS for any cause. Technical Standards for Admission & Matriculation American Council on Pharmaceutical Education (ACPE) is the accrediting body for colleges and schools of pharmacy. ACPE requires that Doctor of Pharmacy curricula meet standards and guidelines which emphasize a strong scientific foundation and practice-based competency. The pharmacy curriculum is designed to develop caring and competent pharmacists, practitioners who assume responsibility for safe and effective medication use in patients. The pharmacy curriculum is also designed to produce pharmacists who are collaborative partners in the care of patients within an interdisciplinary health care system. Technical Standards refer to non- academic admissions and matriculation criteria that are essential to participation in the Doctor of Pharmacy program. All students must possess the intellectual, ethical, physical, and emotional capabilities required to undertake the full curriculum and to achieve the levels of competence required by the faculty. The technical standards described below are essential functions and therefore prerequisites for entrance, continuation, promotion, and graduation from the Doctor of Pharmacy program. Candidates for admission to and graduation from the Campbell University College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences' Doctor of Pharmacy program must possess the following abilities:PHARMACY44 2014-2015 Academic Bulletin Observation The candidate/student-pharmacist must be able to observe required lectures, demonstrations and experiments, including but not limited to microscopic studies, pharmaceutical lab instruction (technical quality of prepared and compounded materials), and patient care demonstrations (physical observation and physical assessment). A candidate/student- pharmacist must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand, noting non-verbal and verbal signals. Observation necessitates functional use of vision, hearing and somatic senses. The candidate/student-pharmacist must be capable of remaining alert and attentive at all times in the clinical setting. Communication A candidate/student-pharmacist must be able to effectively speak, read and write in English. Visual and auditory senses must be intact to detect verbal and nonverbal communication signals. A candidate/ student-pharmacist must be able to elicit information from and communicate effectively and sensitively with patients. The candidate must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in oral and written form with all members of the health care team. Motor Abilities A candidate/student-pharmacist must have sufficient motor function to carry out the basic laboratory experiments and physical assessment. The candidate/ student-pharmacist must be able to carry out duties within the classroom, laboratory, pharmacy and clinic settings. Motor function must be sufficient to perform fundamental patient care, such as required for disease prevention, drug therapy monitoring and basic physical assessment (eg. blood pressure assessment, palpation for edema, injection of vaccines, etc.). Motor function must also be sufficient to perform drug distribution duties in both a community and hospital pharmacy setting. The ability to stand and/or maneuver in small spaces as well as multi-level (steps) environments must be intact. Candidates/student-pharmacists must have the ability to maintain aseptic technique in the preparation of sterile materials. This will require the ability to work under a laminar flow hood and in sterile rooms. A candidate/student pharmacist must be able to safely and effectively operate various types of laboratory and patient care equipment such as weights and balance, a glucose meter, stethoscope and sphygmomanometer. The candidate/ student-pharmacist must be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to provide general care and emergency treatment to patients (eg. student- pharmacists are required to be certified in cardiopulmonary resuscitation). These motor actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium and functional use of the senses of touch, vision, and hearing. Intellectual, Conceptual, Integrative, and Quantitative Problem solving, the critical skill demanded of pharmacists, requires that a candidate/ student-pharmacist be able to learn, retrieve, analyze, sequence, organize, synthesize and integrate information efficiently, and reason effectively. In addition a candidate/ student-pharmacist should possess the ability to measure and calculate accurately, to perceive three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures. Behavioral and Social Attributes A candidate must possess the emotional health required for full utilization of his/her intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients, and the development of mature, sensitive and effective relationships with patients and their family members, staff, and colleagues. Each candidate must be able to work effectively as a member of a health-care team. Candidates must be able to tolerate physically taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. They must be able to adapt to changing environments, to display flexibility and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, collegiality, interest, and motivation are all personal qualities that are assessed during the admission and education processes. If you feel you are unable to meet these technical standards, you are encouraged prior to application, to discuss your disability with the Associate Dean of Admissions in order to determine whether or not reasonable accommodations can be made. Candidates pursuing the academic program who lack the ability to appropriately comply with these standards and who do not seek accommodations may place themselves in academic jeopardy. Campbell University is committed to enabling its students by any reasonable means or accommodations to complete the course of study leading to the Doctor of Pharmacy degree. The use of an intermediary, a person trained to perform essential skills on behalf of the student, is not permitted. Accepted students with a disability who believe they may require special accommodations should contact the Director of Student Support Services immediately upon accepting the offer of admissions. Before matriculation, accepted students must attest in writing that they are able to meet the program's technical standards. The above standards mirror Campbell's PA program technical standards and were modified based on language incorporated from the Technical Standards documents of University of Mississippi, University of Iowa and University of Kentucky schools of pharmacy. www .campbell.edu/cphs 45 PHARMACY1. Academic Probation Academic probation is the initial action for a student failing to make satisfactory academic progress. A student will be placed on academic probation for: Failure to maintain a minimum SGPA of 2.20; Failure to maintain a PGPA of 2.20; Failure to maintain a CGPA of 2.20; A failing grade in a professionally required course; Two or more \"D\" grades in professionally required courses in one semester; Unauthorized failure to complete any degree requirement at the prescribed time. Depending on the nature of the academic deficiencies and overall academic record, a student placed on academic probation may or may not be permitted to continue in the regular sequence of the professional curriculum. A student failing a course in sequence may be permitted to take the next course in the sequence, if directed by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee as part of a modified course of study, or by gaining written permission from the associate dean of academic affairs. If a student fails a professionally required course, it must be repeated during the next term the course is offered. A student placed on academic probation is typically given one semester to correct any grade point deficiencies. The Academic Performance and Standards Committee will review the student's record at the end of the term of probation: If the SGPA and PGPA for that term are 2.20 or above, and the CGPA is 2.20 or above, the student will be released from academic probation. If SGPA and PGPA are 2.20 or above, but the CGPA is below 2.20, the student will remain on academic probation. A student remaining on academic probation for more than two consecutive semesters will be subject to suspension or dismissal. If a student fails to make satisfactory progress during the period of academic probation, and/or fails to correct academic deficiencies, within the prescribed time, that student will be subject to automatic suspension and may be dismissed from CPHS. 2. Academic Suspension Academic Suspension from CPHS occurs when a student: Has failed to make satisfactory progress as demonstrated by SGPA or PGPA less than 2.20, or received more than a single \"D\" grade in a professionally required course during a period of academic probation; Has academic deficiencies which preclude continuation in a normal program of study, but may be expected to be able to complete the requirements for the degree under a modified program of study with or without remedial courses; Has received a failing grade in any two professionally required courses. Suspensions are imposed for a specified period of time and must not exceed one year. A student on academic suspension is not allowed to continue the standard course of study. The Academic Performance and Standards Committee will specify the length of time of the suspension, remedial work required for reinstatement, and the program of study required upon re-instatement. 3. Academic Dismissal Academic dismissal from CPHS will occur when a student: Fails to make satisfactory progress during a period of academic probation or suspension; Has academic deficiencies which preclude continuation in the prescribed program of study, and may not reasonably be expected to complete the requirements of the degree.Academic Standards Retention and Promotion Criteria Full-time students enrolled in the doctor of pharmacy program at the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (CPHS) are expected to make satisfactory academic progress toward completion of the degree requirements. Satisfactory academic progress is defined as successful completion in the prescribed time, maintenance of a 2.2 semester grade point average (SGPA), professionally required course grade point average (PGPA), and a cumulative grade point average (CGPA), and completion of any professional deficiencies and/or required remedial courses in the time and manner prescribed. PGPA calculations are based only on professionally required courses, and do not include grades earned in elective courses. Students who fail to maintain satisfactory academic progress in the professional program are automatically placed on academic probation. They may be required to participate in academic counseling, be enrolled in a remedial program of study or suspended/dismissed according to the policies described in the subsequent sections. Such actions will be determined by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee, with notification to the associate dean of academic affairs. The student will be notified of these actions by the chair of the Academic Performance and Standards Committee. Actions taken in these matters are not to be viewed as punitive, but as a recognition that it is unrealistic to continue in a course of study where there is little probability of success. These same standards will be applied to students enrolled in an approved part-time course of study. 46 2014-2015 Academic Bulletin Except under very extenuating circumstances, academic dismissal will be recommended if a student: Was previously suspended from the College and again failed to make satisfactory academic progress; Is on academic suspension under a remedial course of study and again fails to make satisfactory academic progress as demonstrated by SGPA or PGPA less than 2.20, or earns more than a single D-grade in professionally required courses for that term; Fails a single professionally required course more than one time, or accumulates more than two failures in professionally required courses; Accumulates a grade point deficiency which reasonably precludes the possibility of completing the degree requirements. A student dismissed from the College may seek re-entry by applying for re-admission using the standard admissions process. Academic Status Appeals At the end of each academic term, the Academic Performance and Standards Committee chair reviews the academic performances of all students enrolled in CPHS. The chair notifies each student who does not meet the academic standards as defined by the academic regulations at CPHS. The College's associate dean of academic affairs is also notified. Each student subject to suspension or dismissal is evaluated by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee in order to determine whether to retain or promote the student in the professional program. The student may appear in person before the committee. The chair of the Academic Performance and Standards Committee notifies students in writing regarding any decision by the committee to require a modified course of study, to suspend enrollment, or to dismiss the student from the College and informs the associate dean of academic affairs and associate dean of admissions & student affairs. Students have the opportunity to appeal any decision made by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee by submitting a written petition to the associate dean of academic affairs within seven days of their receipt of notification. The petition must contain the specific variance requested, a description of any extenuating circumstances intended to justify granting the variance, and a proposed course of study and/or conditions for consideration should the variance be granted. The decision of the associate dean of academic affairs is final. Grade Appeals Students with a just reason for appealing a grade in a course at CPHS must first appeal to the course instructor. If the issue cannot be adequately resolved with the instructor, then the student should appeal to the course master. If no resolution is achieved at that level, the student should appeal to the appropriate department chair. After efforts within the department, a student may appeal to the Academic Performance and Standards Committee to seek resolution. If the student feels that the resolution is not just, the student must submit a written petition to the associate dean of academic affairs within seven days of the student's receipt of notification of the Academic Performance and Standards Committee decision. The petition must contain the specific variance requested and a description of any extenuating circumstances intended to justify granting the variance. The decision of the associate dean of academic affairs is final. Advancement to a Higher Class Advancement to a higher class requires: To a Second Professional Year 1. A cumulative grade point average of 2.20 or higher; 2. Completion of all first professional year courses; 3. Completion of all pre-professional requirements 4. Exceptions may be granted by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee and/or the associate dean of academic affairs. To Third Professional Year 1. A cumulative grade point average of 2.20 or higher; 2. Completion of all second professional year courses 3. Exceptions may be granted by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee and/or the associate dean of academic affairs. To Fourth Professional Year 1. A cumulative grade point average of 2.20 or higher; 2. Completion of all third professional year courses Delayed Graduation Policy If a pharmacy student is required to re- take classes as a result of specific course failure or a deficiency in overall academic performance, then a delay in scheduling advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) will occur and the student's graduation will be delayed. Voluntary course withdrawals or a temporary leave of absence will also cause a delay in scheduling APPE and a delay in graduation. Any alteration in the normal curriculum progression may affect a student's financial aid status or qualification for education-based financial aid. For specific counseling and advice students should contact the College's Office of Academic Affairs and the University's Office of Financial Aid. Policy examples: If a student is forced to withdraw from any or all courses in the fall semester, then he or she returns to a delayed schedule in fall of the next year (delaying graduation by one year). To prevent entering financial aid repayment, or \"grace period,\" a student may be able to register for six credits (half- time) of elective or required courses in the spring semester. Specific approval of this modified course plan must be obtained from the College's Office of Academic Affairs and the University's Office of Financial Aid A single course in each semester of the P-2 year may be repeated simultaneously with full time registration as a P-3 student. Approval must be obtained from the College's Office of Academic Affairs. A need to repeat two or more courses in either semester of the P-2 year may prevent simultaneous enrollment in any www .campbell.edu/cphs 47 PHARMACYin either semester of the P-2 year may prevent simultaneous enrollment in any P-3 courses. Progression to the P-3 year will be delayed and graduation will be postponed by one year. Counseling with respect to financial aid considerations must be obtained. If a student earns less than a \"C\" grade in any single P-3 course in the fall semester, he or she may be permitted to continue enrollment in P-3 courses in the spring semester (subject to successful completion of required pre-requisites). However, the student would not be able to complete any P-4 APPE until he or she has successfully completed all P-1, P-2, and P-3 courses, including Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences (IPPE), and the Top 300 Drug Review (PHAR 508). Assuming that all courses are passed successfully in the P-3 spring semester, a student would be able to begin APPE after repeating necessary fall courses. This would allow the student to begin APPE in January of the following year, possibly qualifying for graduation in December depending on available APPE sites. In order to forestall educational loan repayment, a student must enroll at least half-time (six credit hours) when repeating fall courses. If a student fails any P-3 courses in the spring semester, he or she will be prevented from starting his or her APPE until he or she has successfully repeated the courses the following spring. After the student has successfully completed the required courses, he or she may begin his or her APPE immediately subject to preceptor and site availability. If a student begins these experiences in March, he or she may be able to graduate in December. If the student begins in May, he or she cannot graduate until the following May (one year later). If a student fails any P-3 courses, any APPE schedule in place at that time will be entirely cancelled and re-scheduling of all APPE will be necessary (without exception). If a student fails one or more courses, IPPE or APPE rotations, it may be necessary to delay his or her graduation due to limited course offerings or unavailability of appropriate training sites. It currently is not possible for a student to complete a rotation during the months of May or December and also graduate during that month because University graduation certification occurs in the middle of each month. Withdrawal A student may withdraw from a course without penalty at any time prior to the end of the fourth week of a semester. Withdrawal from a course after that period will result in a grade being assigned. In the event a student must withdraw from the College, he or she will be responsible for obtaining the required form for withdrawal from the University Registrar. It is also the student's responsibility to complete the prescribed administrative procedures to assure notification to all individuals and offices that require this information. In cases of serious illness, injuries, or extreme circumstances which normally would require the student's withdrawal from the College, the student may fully withdraw from all semester coursework without receiving a grade. Such cases require adequate documentation of the circumstances. Attendance To receive credit for any course, a student must attend at least 80% of the hours prescribed for the course. Individual professors have the prerogative of imposing a more restrictive policy consistent with the following exceptions: Absence due to serious illness, injury, or death in the student's immediate family; Authorized representation of the College or University. In the above cases, a student may be permitted to make up work missed. It is the student's responsibility, whenever possible, to notify College officials in advance that he or she will be absent. Transfer Students CPHS does not accept transfer students directly into the doctor of pharmacy program. The College utilizes a process to evaluate potential students that may differ from other programs. In addition, there is a great deal of heterogeneity among doctor of pharmacy curricula across the nation. The scheduling difficulties for correcting potential course deficits become extremely complicated. Furthermore, the College could only consider such requests if space becomes available due to a decrease in the number of enrolled students; therefore, CPHS has determined that accepting transfer students with advanced standing is not in the best interest of the student nor the College. The College feels it would not be providing consistent opportunity for all students. As a result, students currently enrolled in a doctor of pharmacy program in the United States should apply to CPHS as an entry-level student. Interested individuals must follow the procedures for admission. Applicants must be in good academic standing and have a letter from the dean of their institution supporting the request. These admissions decisions will be handled in the same manner as all other applicants to the College by the actions of the Admissions Committee Any individual admitted to CPHS who has completed coursework in another doctor of pharmacy program or another graduate/ professional degree may formally request transfer of credits. All accepted transfer students seeking \"advanced standing\" through the transfer of credits must submit a formal request as outlined in the policy and procedure for course transfer and waiver in the CPHS Academic Bulletin. All prerequisites must be met prior to matriculation to the doctor of pharmacy program at Campbell University. CPHS reserves the right to make changes in requirements for admission, curriculum, standards for progression, advancement and graduation, fees and rules and regulations To apply to the doctor of pharmacy program, please follow the policies and procedures in the admissions portion of the CPHS Academic Bulletin. Transfer Credit & Course Waiver Policy Students may formally request an evaluation of previously earned professional coursework for transfer credit or the waiver of course requirements of pre-professional and professional courses. Each course transferred or waived must be by written, 48 2014-2015 Academic Bulletin affirmative acceptance of the dean. The process for transfer or course-waiver is not automatic. The review of transfer courses or course-waivers may only be initiated after a student has enrolled or been accepted for enrollment and paid the matriculation deposit for the doctor of pharmacy program. CPHS can only accept transfer of equivalent professional courses from an ACPE accredited institution. A student may transfer equivalent professional courses that meet the requirements of the curriculum. To be eligible for transfer and replacement of a course in the professional curriculum, the requested course for transfer must meet all of the following requirements: Be documented on an official transcript provided by the registrar of the accredited institution Have an earned grade of 70% or higher, or a grade of \"C\" or greater Be of the same general content and level of instruction as the equivalent course in the CPHS doctor of pharmacy curriculum at the time requesting transfer Be equal or greater in the number of semester credit hours as the course required in the CPHS professional curriculum. A student granted transfer credit will not be required to enroll or pay tuition and fees for the transferred course; however, full-time tuition is charged to all students enrolled in at least 12 semester hours. Upon approval for transfer, the student will be given credit for the transferred course on the official transcript. Credit hours for transferred courses that exceed the number of credits for the equivalent course at CPHS will not count towards elective credits in the curriculum. A student may formally request to receive a course-waiver for a required course in the doctor of pharmacy curriculum provided the student successfully completed an upper division or graduate course that: Is completed from an accredited institution recognized by CPHS Is documented on an official transcript provided by the registrar or equivalent of the accredited institution Has an earned grade of 80% or higher, or a grade of \"B\" or greater Be of the equivalent general content and level of instruction as the equivalent course in the CPHS doctor of pharmacy curriculum at the time of the request for waiver Be equal or greater in the number of semester credit hours as the course required in the CPHS doctor of pharmacy curriculum. A student granted a course-waiver would not be required to enroll in the equivalent professional course or be given degree program credit for the waived course. The student will be required to complete an equivalent number of semester credit hours in elective offerings to meet the total degree requirements for the doctor of pharmacy program. Procedure 1. An enrolled student or deposited applicant must present a signed letter to the associate dean of admissions & student affairs describing the course(s) in the professional curriculum that the student or applicant seeks to transfer or receive course-waiver. The following should be included with the letter: Documentation that the student or applicant has, before submitting the letter, made a request to the registrar of the previous institution to submit official documentation of the course(s) directly to CPHS, and has paid the appropriate fees, if any, to the previous institution to process the document Appropriate documentation to support the equivalence of the proposed transfer course or course-waiver as determined by CPHS. 2. Upon receipt of the letter and documentation, the associate dean of admissions & student affairs will determine the applicant's status for enrollment or acceptance to the doctor of pharmacy program and payment of the matriculation deposit. The associate dean of admissions & student affairs will communicate in writing the status of the application to the applicant, including any requirements that must be met by the applicant prior to processing the request. 3. The associate dean of admissions & student affairs will maintain the letter and documentation until such time as CPHS receives the official documentation from the previous institution(s). Upon receipt, the associate dean will transmit the request to the associate dean of academic affairs for evaluation and recommended disposition. 4. The associate dean of academic affairs will evaluate the transcript, course(s) and documentation submitted. If the associate dean of academic affairs has any question as to the equivalence of the course(s), he or she may contact the previous institution to secure additional information. If the associate dean of academic affairs determines that the submitted documentation is insufficient to determine equivalency, he or she may contact the applicant or previous institution to secure adequate documentation, or return the application to the applicant with an explanation of the required documentation to determine equivalence. 5. If the associate dean of academic affairs is not familiar with the content, he or she shall consult with the appropriate course director to determine course equivalency. 6. The associate dean of academic affairs shall make a recommendation to the dean whether to accept or deny the course transfer or course-waiver. 7. The dean shall make the final determination of the acceptance of the course transfer or waiver and communicate his or her decision in writing to the applicant and the Campbell University registrar. The decision of the dean shall be final.www .campbell.edu/cphs 49 PHARMACY Matriculation Policies Students enrolled in the doctor of pharmacy program are required to fulfill the following: Submit the required non-refundable admissions deposit. Submit a signed honor code form indicating that the student has received, read, understands and agrees to adhere to the provisions of the honor code of the Campbell University College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences. Submit original transcripts from each college or university where any coursework was completed (undergraduate, graduate, professional, etc.) to the Office of Admissions & Student Affairs prior to the beginning of classes. It is strongly preferred that transcripts are sent at the end of each semester during the application process. Complete all prerequisite coursework prior to matriculation with official transcripts submitted as mentioned above. Complete the required vaccination and immunization requirements, including the Hepatitis A series, Hepatitis B series, varicella immunity, Tdap and a TB test. The Hepatitis A series is delivered in two injections over a six month period. The Hepatitis B series is delivered in three injections over a six month period. Each student must provide Student Health Services with a completed immunization and medical history form prior to the first day of classes. Submit to a criminal background check as described by the following procedure. CPHS applicants are required to self- disclose any misdemeanors and felony convictions, other than minor traffic violations, including deferred adjudications, with the understanding that non-disclosure or falsification may lead to dismissal and disclosure may prevent enrollment. Additionally, in response to requirements in the professional practice environment stating that facilities providing care to patients must minimize the risk to patients that may be presented by persons with prior criminal activity, a criminal background check will be completed on all accepted applicants prior to matriculation. Please refer to the General Information section at the back of this bulletin for the Criminal Background Check Policy. Submit to scheduled and random substance abuse screens each year as necessitated by the College and its affiliates. Attend all mandatory orientation sessions as applicable for new and returning students. Complete all programmatic standards as required by the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences. Graduation Requirements Complete all required courses with a passing grade in each course and a 2.20 cumulative GPA Ensure appropriate graduation paperwork is filed in the timeframe specified by the university Receive an approving recommendation by the CPHS faculty Fulfill all financial obligations to the institution Attend the applicable commencement ceremonyGrading System The following is the grading scales for the doctor of pharmacy program at CPHS with the assigned quality points: Grade Quality of Work 4-Point Scale A Superior/Excellent 4 B Above average 3 C Average 2 D Below average 1 F Failure 0 I Incomplete 0 IC Incomplete continued 0 WF Failing at time of withdrawal 0 WP Passing at time of withdrawal 0 AU Audit 0 P Passing (graduate only) 0 Grades of \"A, B, C, D, F, I, and WF\" are included in semester hours attempted and will affect the grade point average. Grades of \"IC, WP, AU, and P\" will not affect the grade point average. A grade of \"I\" must be removed by the completion of the work within 30 days after the opening of the next semester; otherwise, it will be recorded as an \"F.\" A grade of \"IC\" must be removed by the completion of the work within 120 days. A student may appeal a grade within a period of one academic year from the semester in which the grade was assigned. No changes to the transcript will be made after a 12-month period unless a professor acknowledges in writing that an error in grade reporting has occurred. Grade Reports, Records, and Transcripts A report of grades attained by a student will be mailed to the address designated by the student, at the time of registration, at the end of each semester. Students enrolled at Campbell University who are fulfilling pre- pharmacy requirements will also be provided with a mid-term report. The official records of each student attending CPHS will be secured in the Office of the Registrar. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (PL93-380) will govern the release of information for this record which contains the transcript from Campbell University, transcripts and transcript evaluations from other educational agencies attended by the student, secondary school transcripts, scholastic aptitude, and other standardized test scores. The application for admission, general correspondence with the student and, if applicable, letters concerning misconduct or disciplinary actions at Campbell University are kept in the CPHS Office of Admissions & Student Affairs. The transcript and contents of the permanent record may be examined by the student upon appointment with the University's registrar. Counseling During the first professional year orientation, CPHS assigns a faculty member as the class advisor to provide guidance while students are in the College. This faculty member, the associate dean of academic affairs, associate dean of admissions & student affairs and the staff are available to discuss personal and academic problems that may arise and provide guidance and/or referrals to other resources as necessary. Helpline A free and confidential helpline is available to all CPHS students providing telephone counseling and a referral service. The number is 866-428-3591. Students will be asked to provide their CU student I.D. number, address and phone number. Following the call, a secure report is generated by ProtoCall based on the triage assessment.

Substance Abuse Screening Policy & Protocol Substance abuse screening is becoming mandatory in many healthcare facilities prior to participating in patient care. Due to this trend, a negative substance abuse screening test is required prior to matriculation into the DPT program. Therefore, applicants to the DPT program will be notified of the substance abuse screening test requirement as part of the application process. Repeated testing may be required as determined by the DPT program or clinical training sites. Clinical education training sites may require CPHS to provide a copy of testing results performed on students. Training sites may set their own standards in regard to who they will admit based on the results of the substance abuse screening test. Students who are unwilling to allow the release of required personal information may not be able to be placed at an affiliated clinical education site, and cannot meet the requirements for graduation. A copy is sent to the Director of Clinical Education and kept in a locking file cabinet for 4 years. Procedure 1. A substance abuse screening test will be completed on all accepted applicants to the DPT Program prior to matriculation. 2. The next steps document provided to deposited applicants by the program will include information about these requirements with the contingency that the final decision regarding matriculation will be made after institutional review of the accepted applicant's substance abuse screening test report. 3. Appropriate authorization, with pertinent identifying information necessary to initiate the test, will be received from each accepted applicant prior to initiating a substance abuse screening test. 4. Students must have the sample collected at the Campbell University's Student Health Services or at a CPHS approved collection site. CPHS will contract with an outside vendor for the performance of the test. Such tests will be conducted in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other applicable laws. 5. If the test result is positive, the DPT Program Admissions Committee will review the information and the application. Depending on the decision of the Admissions Committee, the student's acceptance can be rescinded or advancement to clinical year delayed based on these results. 6. All substance abuse screening tests will be maintained in a secure location to assure confidentiality. Routine access to the information will be limited to a staff member in the Office of Admissions & Student Affairs, the Associate Dean of Admissions & Student Affairs, the DPT Program Director and the University General Counsel. 7. Cost of subsequent tests required by clinical sites will be the responsibility of the student. Student Health Services Physical therapy students may utilize the Student Health Service for preventive services and personal health concerns. For patient privacy and confidentiality, DPT student must not be treated by DPT faculty who may occasionally cover the clinic. The students should identify themselves as a DPT student when checking into the clinic so that they may be scheduled with a non- faculty provider.

All teaching laboratories and lecture halls will www .campbell.edu/cphs 67 PHYSICAL THERAPYbe kept in neat working order. No shoes or sharp objects will be allowed on treatment tables. Faculty and students are responsible for replacing linens and cleaning treatment tables after use. Students will not be allowed to use physical agents or exercise equipment to treat fellow students or outside persons as this is a violation of state law and the student honor code. Utilization of equipment for learning and study purposes is allowed outside of scheduled class times. No person should use a piece of equipment for which no training has occurred to avoid accidental injury or equipment damage. Maintenance of equipment will be the responsibility of program faculty. Equipment will be maintained through clean practices and safe handling along with annual calibration and safety review. A log will be kept in the program directors office of all equipment containing a tag number for each item. This tag will be placed by facilities services and placed in a rotation for annual calibration and safety review. Environmental Health and Safety The CPHS has the Environmental Health and Safety Committee that is responsible for updating and maintaining the laboratory safety manual to include policy & procedure, safety, training, storage, and disposal of hazardous chemicals. The Lab Safety Manual can be accessed in the program directors office. Emergency contact numbers are posted in the administrative assistant to the program directors office. Training is supplied and recorded (kept in secure file cabinet in director's office) for all faculty, students, and staff that participate in scholarship activities involving hazardous chemicals in laboratories. At this time, the DPT program does not contain a laboratory containing hazardous chemicals or materials. Consent and Release for Classroom/Laboratory Participation The DPT program has a policy regarding human subject's participation in demonstration within the classroom or laboratory setting. Students and human subjects sign consent form to participate in laboratory or classroom demonstration. A copy of this form is available from any core faculty member or staff personnel. This form will be signed by students in the first semester of the program. Human subjects may sign as participation is required. Signed forms will be stored in locked file cabinet within student's personal file. Human subjects outside of the program will have signed copies stored within the course folder for the year of service. Use of Images or Video Recording The DPT program has a policy that is to be signed by students and human subjects that participate in classroom, research, or laboratory activities involving photography, recording of images, or video recording. A copy of the form is available from any core faculty member or staff personnel. Signed forms will be stored within individual course folders by year or with associated research documents in a locked file cabinet. Dress Code It is expected that students wear appropriate clothing for didactic and laboratory courses and in clinical/experiential training. Laboratory clothing typically needs to allow access for easy manipulation and palpation of body parts. Therefore, wearing shorts, t-shirts, and sports bra or similar is appropriate. Business casual is the dress for guest lecturers, College and University events, clinical experiences, and off-site activities (e.g. slacks/skirt and button down shirt/blouse). For clinical/ experiential training, the dress code will be dictated by company policy. E.g. a hospital based rotation may require scrubs while an outpatient clinic may require slacks and a buttoned down shirt. If a company policy does not exist, refer to the clinical education manual for dress code. The following items are never appropriate in any setting: Bikini/speedo Clothing that exposes breasts Pants below hips that expose undergarments Any clothing that allows for viewing of undergarments while performing job duties or classroom activities Pajamas and slippers Honor Code Refer to the General Information section of this academic bulletin for the Honor Code. Physical therapy students are required to read and sign the Honor Code, attesting that they understand the code, that they have read and understand the bulletin, and will abide by it. A signed copy of the code will be kept in the students file.Counseling During the first professional year orientation, CPHS DPT assigns each student to a faculty member to provide guidance and advising while students are in the program. The faculty member, director of physical therapy, the associate dean of academic affairs, associate dean of admissions & student affairs and the staff are available to discuss personal and academic problems that may arise and provide guidance and/or referrals to other resources as necessary. If a situation arises that may require medical assistance, these services are offered within student health services (http://www.campbell.edu/ student-services/health-services/). Should a student feel a health issue may necessitate accommodation to complete the DPT program or is in need of tutoring or coaching, information can be found at http://www. campbell.edu/student-services/student- support-services/. Technical Standards for Admission In accordance with Section 504 of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the administration and faculty of Campbell Universities Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) program have established the essential non-academic functions for students to participate. The admissions committee will consider applicants who demonstrate the ability to perform, or learn, the essential skills listed in this document. Campbell University must confirm patients are not placed in danger by students with impaired intellectual, physical, or emotional functions. Students will be evaluated in all the areas listed below to meet requirements for admission, continuation, promotion, and graduation from the DPT program. The use of an intermediary, a person trained to perform essential skills on behalf of the student, is not permitted. Upon admission, a student who discloses in writing a properly certified disability may receive reasonable accommodation, however, he/she must be able to perform the essential functions within the curriculum and the described standards listed below. Formal disclosure should be made in the Office of Student Support Services, 227 Main Street, Buies Creek, NC 27506. 68 2014-2015 Academic Bulletin Candidates for admission to and matriculation from the Campbell DPT program should possess, at a minimum, the following abilities: Behavioral/Social Skills and Professionalism Students in the Campbell University DPT program must demonstrate attributes of empathy, compassion, integrity, collegiality, high moral character, excellent interpersonal communication, listening, and self- motivation, as such qualities are assessed throughout the program.

Intellectual/Conceptual, Integrative, and Qualitative Skills Students in the Campbell University DPT program must demonstrate the ability to utilize computer technology. Students must be able to interpret and comprehend three- dimensional and spatial relationships of body structures. Proper reasoning requires students to measure, calculate, analyze, and synthesize information pertinent to problem solving and establishing a PT diagnosis. The aforementioned skills allow students to create proper assessments and sound judgment necessary for correct decisions in rehabilitative intervention and documentation of patient outcomes. Recognize the impact of disability and dysfunction while integrating the needs of patient/family into the plan of care.Communication Skills Students in the Campbell University DPT program must be able communicate and comprehend the English language in written, oral, and electronic forms with faculty and classmates in academic settings along with members of healthcare team and patients in clinical/professional settings. Examples of communications skills may include speaking, writing, hearing, and reading. The ability to elicit information regarding mood/affect, alertness, activity, movement, function, and non-verbal behavior are essential. Sensory/Observational Skills Students in the Campbell University DPT program must be able to observe cadaveric dissection, wounds, burns, pelvis and perineum and other potentially unsettling tasks throughout the curriculum. Students must be able to observe patients to obtain a history directly from the patient or guardian. Such observation requires use of vision, hearing, and other somatosensory modalities. Motor Skills Students in the Campbell University DPT program must demonstrate adequate strength and endurance along with fine and gross motor skills to perform frequent lifting, twisting, bending, kneeling, pushing/ pulling necessary with patient transfers, gait, assessment, and intervention.

These actions require coordination of many sensory systems (vision, hearing, equilibrium, touch). Academic Standards Reports on academic performance and progress are generated at the mid-term and completion of each semester. The DPT program core faculty meets at the end of each academic term, or as necessary, to discuss the academic performance of all students. Any discussions regarding type of academic deficiency and remedy occurs with development of an action plan (if remediation is required; see below for remediation process) and draft of a letter from the program director stating the specific academic standing described in the following sections. The letter will be provided to the student via email and hard copy by mail. The letter will contain the following: 1.Description of academic standing (remediation, probation, suspension, dismissal) 2. Rationale for academic standing 3. Criteria required to regain good academic standing 4. Contact information of the program director to discuss items outlined in the letter 5. Notification of appeals process Core faculty is actively involved in promoting student retention through annual advisement sessions. A modified generic abilities document will be used to guide the process. Advisement can occur more frequently (e.g. professionalism, behavioral, or academic concerns) should the need arise. Mechanisms are in place to encourage students to seek assistance for academic performance using StarFish and Examsoft programs. Retention and Promotion Criteria Full-time students enrolled in the doctor of physical therapy program at the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (CPHS) are expected to make satisfactory academic progress toward completion of the degree requirements. Satisfactory academic progress is defined as successful completion of didactic and experiential training in the prescribed time and maintenance of a 2.8 cumulative grade point average (GPA). Students who fail to maintain satisfactory academic progress in the professional program are automatically placed on academic probation. They may be required to participate in academic counseling, be enrolled in a remedial program of study, or suspended/dismissed according to the www .campbell.edu/cphs 69 PHYSICAL THERAPYpolicies described in subsequent sections. Students, who fail to maintain good academic standing at the completion of a semester prior to a semester requiring a clinical internship, may not be allowed to participate in the clinical education portion of that semester. The student would need to undergo a remedial course of study, with successful completion, prior to engaging in the internships (DPT 800, 802, 804, 806). In the event remediation is not successful, students cannot progress to the clinical internship. Such actions will be recommended by the DPT Academic Performance & Standards committee and program director, with notification to the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs. The student will be notified of these actions by the director of the DPT program. Students may need to take leave from the DPT program for non-academic reasons considered and approved by the program director on a case-by-case basis (e.g. medical illness, financial, etc). Should a student be unable to attend classes for 2 consecutive weeks for a reason approved by the program director, disengagement from the program will be necessary. Should absence occur during clinical internships, see policies in Clinical Education Manual. The length of disengagement and any requirements for reengagement will be outlined in a letter from the program director along with a face-to-face meeting. The length of disengagement cannot be greater than 3 consecutive semesters. The following contains a description of the types of academic standing within the DPT program: 1. Good Academic Standing Students will be considered in good academic standing providing: Cumulative GPA 2.8 Passing grades for all clinical/experiential training No violations of student honor code or code of conduct have occurred. 2. Remediation Students who fail to meet academic standards within a given course or clinical/ experiential rotation may be required to remediate coursework and/or attend another clinical/experiential training. Students will require remediation for any patient safety issue throughout the curriculum. Students must initiate remediation should a grade of < 70% or failure on any examination within a given course. The content of remediation will be directed by the course instructor within a week of receiving a grade. Successful remediation of a practical exam must occur in the provided time and only a single attempt is allowed. If the student is not successful he/she may be placed on academic probation or suspension. Should a student fail to remediate academic performance, or there are any behavioral and/or non-academic reasons preventing them from participating in regularly scheduled clinical experience or internship, this rotation must be remediated prior to graduation from the program. Should a student fail a clinical/experiential rotation, this rotation must be remediated prior to graduation from the program. In most cases, this will need to be completed at the end of the program thereby increasing the length of the program for students in this situation. With fixed date licensure testing, students in this situation may fall out of sequence and will not be able to sit for the licensure examination for several months after graduation. Upon successful completion, the student will graduate assuming all didactic courses have been completed. See Graduation after Deceleration policy. If the student is unable to successfully pass a clinical/experiential rotation/ internship during the program, the student will be out of sequence in the didactic portion and may require temporary disengagement from the program (necessitating placement on academic suspension) until rejoining in the normal curriculum sequence. A student failing more than one clinical/experiential rotation will be dismissed from the program. 3. Academic Probation Academic probation is the initial action for a student failing to make satisfactory academic progress. A student will be placed on academic probation for: Failure to maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.8 A grade of D in any single course Failure to complete any degree requirement at the prescribed time without prior approvalDepending on the nature of the academic deficiencies and overall academic record, a student placed on academic probation may or may not be permitted to continue in the regular sequence of the professional curriculum. Students cannot be on academic probation more than two times throughout the program and may not be on probation for more than 2 consecutive semesters. Students who fail to complete the criteria for lifting academic probation will be considered for suspension or dismissal from the DPT program. The core DPT Academic Performance & Standards committee and director will review the student's record each semester and again at the end of the term of probation. A recommendation will be made to the program director to restore good academic standing if: 1. The cumulative GPA returns to 2.8 or above within 2 consecutive semesters of being placed on probation, the student will be released from academic probation. 2. Successfully completed a deficient clinical/experiential training and recommendation for a return term/year for the program A recommendation will be made to the program director to suspend/dismiss if while on academic probation: 1. A student makes a \"D\" or below in any course. 2. A student fails to correct academic deficiencies within the prescribed time. 4. Academic Suspension Academic Suspension from the DPT program and CPHS occurs when a student: Has failed to make satisfactory progress as demonstrated by a cumulative GPA greater than 2.80, or received a grade of \"D\" in any course during a period of academic probation. Has academic deficiencies which preclude continuation in a normal program of study, but may be expected to be able to complete the requirements for the degree under a modified program of study with or without remedial courses. Suspensions are imposed for a specified period of time and must not exceed one year. A student on academic suspension is not allowed to continue the standard course 70 2014-2015 Academic Bulletin of study. The DPT program director will specify the length of time of the suspension, remedial work required for reinstatement, and the program of study required upon re-instatement in consultation with the DPT Academic Performance & Standards committee. The CPHS Associate Dean for Academic Affairs may be consulted as needed. 5. Academic Dismissal Academic dismissal from the DPT program and CPHS may be recommended to the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs by the director of the DPT program and DPT Academic Performance and Standards Committee if a student: Makes a F in a single course Fails to make satisfactory progress during a period of academic probation or suspension; Has an academic deficiency which precludes continuation in the prescribed program of study, and may not reasonably be expected to complete the requirements of the degree. A student dismissed from the College may seek re-entry by applying for re-admission using the standard admissions process. Academic Status Appeals At the end of each academic term, the DPT director will notify the DPT Academic Performance and Standards Committee of all students enrolled in DPT program that qualify for academic probation, suspension, or dismissal. The DPT program director notifies each student who does not meet the academic standards as defined by the academic regulations at CPHS. The College's Associate Dean of Academic Affairs is also notified for any student at risk of suspension/ dismissal. Each student subject to suspension or dismissal (as recommended by DPT core faculty and program director) is evaluated by the DPT Academic Performance and Standards Committee in order to make a recommendation whether to retain or promote the student in the professional program. The student may appear in person before the committee. The DPT program director notifies students in writing regarding any decision by the committee to require a modified course of study, to suspend enrollment, or to dismiss the student from the College and informs Associate Dean of Academic Affairs and Associate Dean of Admissions & Student Affairs. Students have the opportunity to appeal any decision made by the DPT Academic Performance and Standards Committee by submitting a written petition to the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs within seven days of their receipt of notification. The petition must contain the specific variance requested, a description of any extenuating circumstances intended to justify granting the variance, and a proposed course of study and/or conditions for consideration should the variance be granted. The decision of the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs is final. Grade Appeals Students with a just reason for appealing a grade in a course within the DPT program must first appeal to the course instructor. If the issue cannot be adequately resolved with the instructor, then the student should appeal to the DPT program Academic Performance and Standards Committee. Should resolution not occur at the committee level, the DPT program director will hear from the DPT Academic Performance and Standards committee chair and the student and render a final decision. If efforts within the department are not satisfactory, a student may appeal via written petition to the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs within seven days of the student's receipt of notification of the DPT Academic Performance and Standards Committee decision. The petition must contain the specific variance requested and a description of any extenuating circumstances intended to justify granting the variance. The decision of the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs is final. Delayed Graduation Policy If a Physical Therapy student is required to re-take classes as a result of specific course failure or a deficiency in overall academic performance, then a delay in scheduling Physical Therapy clinical experiences or matriculation through the curriculum will occur and the student's graduation may be delayed. Voluntary course withdrawals or a temporary leave of absence may cause a delay in scheduling Physical Therapy clinical experiences, progress through the curriculum, and a subsequent delay in graduation. Any alteration in the normal curriculum progression may affect a student's financial aid status or qualification for education-based financial aid. For specific counseling and advice, students should contact the College's Office of Academic Affairs and the University's Office of Financial Aid. Withdrawal A student may withdraw from a course without grade assignment at any time prior to the end of the fourth week of a semester. Withdrawal from a course after that period will result in a grade being assigned. In the event a student must withdraw from the College, he or she will be responsible for obtaining the required form for withdrawal from the University Registrar. It is also the student's responsibility to complete the prescribed administrative procedures to assure notification to all individuals and offices that require this information. In cases of serious illness, injuries, or extreme circumstances which normally would require the student's withdrawal from the College, the student may fully withdraw from all semester coursework without receiving a grade. Such cases require adequate documentation of the circumstances and approval by program director. Attendance Attendance is mandatory for all class sessions and clinical experiences throughout the DPT curriculum. If an absence must occur, students should notify the course instructor within 24 hours or at the earliest possible time. Excused absences may include: Absence due to serious illness, injury, or death involving the student or the student's immediate family; Authorized representation of the College or University Individual instructors have the ability to grant approved absence In the above cases, a student may be permitted to make up work missed with required documentation (e.g. obituary listing, physician note). It is the student's responsibility, whenever possible; to notify College officials in advance that he or she will be absent. Repeated violations of unexcused www .campbell.edu/cphs 71 PHYSICAL THERAPYabsences may be subject to consequences within the Student Honor Code. Graduation Requirements Recommendation for graduation requires faculty approval and attainment of the following requirements: Successful completion of all courses, requirements, and remediation Successful completion of all clinical/ experiential training Attendance of graduation week activities that includes licensure preparation courses and comprehensive curriculum review Attendance at the graduation ceremony is expected Graduation after Deceleration DPT students who decelerate due to approved medical leave, and are in good academic standing, may walk at the graduation ceremony with their original cohort if they lack no more than six hours of credit (one clinical rotation). The missing credit must be completed no later than March 15 of the original graduation date. Students who lack more than six hours of credit will walk at the next graduation ceremony after completion of their outstanding requirements. Students who decelerate will receive their degree at the next University awarding period; either the May, August, or December graduation dates. Students may not sit for their FSBPT licensure examination until after the degree has been awarded. With fixed date testing, the FSBPT application is due at least 6 weeks prior to testing date. See https://www.fsbpt. org/ForCandidatesAndLicensees/NPTE/ FixedDateTestingInfo/index.asp for available testing dates. Employment while in the Program Outside employment during the DPT program is strongly discouraged. Required program activities cannot be altered. Outside obligations cannot interfere or impede class attendance or completion of assignments and program requirements. Students must not substitute for faculty or staff by performing any administrative, clerical, or clinical duties while on supervised clinical experiences.Transfer Students CPHS DPT does not accept transfer students directly into the DPT program. Students currently enrolled in another DPT program in the United States seeking admission into the Campbell DPT program will be asked to apply. Interested individuals must follow the procedures for admission. Applicants must be in good academic standing and have a letter from the dean of their institution supporting the request. These admissions decisions will be handled in the same manner as all other applicants to the College by the actions of the Admissions Committee. All prerequisites must be met prior to matriculation to the DPT program at Campbell University. CPHS reserves the right to make changes in requirements for admission, curriculum, standards for progression, advancement and graduation, fees and rules and regulations. To apply to the DPT program, please follow the policies and procedures in the admissions portion of the CPHS Academic Bulletin. Grading System The following arbitrary grading scale is utilized for the DPT program: Grade A 90-100 B 80-89.99 C 70-79.99 D 60-69.99 F 59.99 or below WP Withdraw - Passing WF Withdraw - Failing P Pass NP No Pass I Incomplete Grades of \"A, B, C, D, F, and WF\" are included in semester hours attempted and will affect the grade point average. Grades of \"WP, P, I, and NP\" will not affect the grade point average. A student may appeal a grade within a period of one semester from the semester in which the grade was assigned. No changes to the transcript will be made after a semester period unless a professor acknowledges in writing that an error in grade reporting has occurred. An instructor or director initiated inquiry/request will be remediated and corrected at any time.Grade Reports, Records, and Transcripts A report of grades attained by a student will be mailed to the address designated by the student, at the time of registration and at the end of each semester. The official records of each student attending CPHS will be secured in the Office of the Registrar. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (PL93- 380) will govern the release of information for this record which contains the transcript from Campbell University, transcripts and transcript evaluations from other educational agencies attended by the student, secondary school transcripts, scholastic aptitude, and other standardized test scores. The application for admission, general correspondence with the student and, if applicable, letters concerning misconduct or disciplinary actions at Campbell University are kept in the CPHS Office of Admissions & Student Affairs. The transcript and contents of the permanent record may be examined by the student upon appointment with the University's registrar. Curriculum Campbell University's Doctor of Physical Therapy Program is a 36 month graduate degree program with 26.5 months of didactic education and 9.5 months of supervised clinical internships. Graduates will receive the Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) degree upon successful completion. There is a 1 week summative session before graduation. The program starts in January with graduation in December. Most didactic courses are held on the main campus with a few online courses completed while on clinical internships in the final year of study. The DPT program curriculum is a competency-based graduate education (minimum required skills for physical therapist education and normative model of PT education) curriculum based on a hybrid model pulling from traditional, lifespan, and problem based learning. The sequence of courses is designed to start with foundation courses in the basic sciences, professional development, and early clinical skills. Following the initial foundational coursework, subsequent courses teach clinical assessment and intervention, medical, surgical and pharmacy concepts in patient management from a population based lifespan perspective. Integrated curricular themes in service-72 2014-2015 Academic Bulletin learning and early clinical experiences, therapeutic exercise, and approach to patient care using a lifespan model is designed to enhance student learning and promote confidence in application of skills and didactic knowledge. Problem based learning courses are designed to enhance student interaction in clinical reasoning, application of concepts/skills, and critical interpretation of evidence. The integrated service learning and clinical experiences are designed to encourage inter-professional interaction and collaboration. Assessment of students in the didactic/classroom years is by written examinations, performance on laboratory practical examinations, reflective journals, professional portfolio, and participation in small group activities. Four clinical rotations occur throughout the curriculum with a six week introductory internship in the spring of the second year. The remaining three clinical internships occur in the 3rd program year with durations of 10-12 weeks for a total of 38 weeks of clinical training. Students must complete a clinical internship in a rural location. Clinical internships need to be completed in an acute/subacute or hospital, rehabilitation, musculoskeletal, and neuromuscular practice settings. Specialized settings may include burn/wound care, aquatic, industrial/ vocational, and VA/military locations.

All relevant coursework required for graduation must be completed in the Campbell PA Program. Complaint Procedure Refer to the General Information section of this academic bulletin for the complaint procedure. Criminal Background Check College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (CPHS) applicants are required to self- disclose any misdemeanors or felony convictions, other than minor traffic violations, including deferred adjudications, with the understanding that non-disclosure or falsification may lead to dismissal and disclosure may prevent enrollment. Additionally, in response to requirements in the professional practice environment stating that facilities providing care to patients must minimize the risk to patients that may be presented by persons with prior criminal activity, a criminal background check will be completed on all accepted applicants prior to matriculation. Please refer to the General Information section of this bulletin for the criminal background check policy and protocol. Health Insurance All College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (CPHS) students are required to have health insurance coverage. Before registration, students must either provide proof of health insurance or purchase the health insurance available through the University. Any medical costs incurred by students as a result of needle sticks, exposure to infectious diseases or materials, while in training, are the responsibility of the student and his or her health insurance carrier. Please note that the health insurance policy available through the University is basic and students may want to seek a different insurance policy that provides more coverage as their only insurance or as a supplement to the Hospitalization/Sickness policy. CPHS asks all students to seriously evaluate their health insurance options and suggests that they do not rely on this basic policy for extensive coverage. Immunization Before registration, all students are required to provide a completed medical history form, and proof of immunization to Student Health Services. A completed physical examination form is required for physician assistant students. Students are responsible for maintaining immunizations; this is required by CPHS in order to complete all required supervised clinical practice experiences in the PA curriculum. All students must provide proof of adequate immunization/immunity for the following: Hepatitis B Tdap MMR Polio Varicella TB skin test within one month of registration and annually thereafter Some clinical sites may require more frequent testing If the TB test is positive a chest x-ray is required See Student Health Service immunization form for further information on timing and sequence of required immunizations (http://www.campbell.edu/content/686/ immunizationform.pdf). Infection Control Please refer to the infection control guidelines in the General Information section of this Academic Bulletin for more details. Sexual Harassment Policy Refer to the General Information section of this Academic Bulletin for the sexual harassment policy. www .campbell.edu/cphs 83 PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT PROGRAMSubstance Abuse Screening Protocol Substance abuse screening is becoming mandatory at many health care facilities prior to participating in patient care either as a learner or a staff member. In light of this development, a negative substance abuse screening test is required before matriculation into the PA Program, and again before advancement to the clinical year. Therefore, applicants to the PA Program will be notified of the substance abuse screening test requirement as part of the application process. Repeated screening tests may be required as determined by the PA Program or the clinical training site. Clinical education sites may require the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (CPHS) to provide them with a copy of the results of any substance abuse test performed on students immediately prior to and for the duration of their placement at the site. Clinical education sites may set their own standards in regard to who they will admit based on the results of the substance abuse screening or require further screening. Students who are not willing to allow the release of the required personal information may not be able to be placed at an affiliated clinical education site, and thus cannot meet the requirements for graduation. Procedure 1. A substance abuse screening test will be completed on all accepted applicants to the PA Program prior to matriculation. 2. The letter sent by the program to each accepted applicant, as well as to selected wait-listed applicants will include information about these requirements with the contingency that the final decision regarding matriculation will be made after institutional review of the accepted applicant's substance abuse screening test report. 3. Appropriate authorization, with pertinent identifying information necessary to initiate the test, will be received from each accepted applicant prior to initiating a substance abuse screening test. 4. Students must have the sample collected at the Campbell University Health Center or at a CPHS approved collection site. CPHS will contract with an outside vendor for the performance of the test. Such tests will be conducted in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other applicable laws. 5. If the test result is positive, the PA Program Admissions Committee will review the information and the application. Depending on the decision of the Admissions Committee, the student's acceptance can be rescinded or advancement to clinical year delayed based on these results. 6. All substance abuse screening tests will be maintained in a secure location to assure confidentiality. Routine access to the information will be limited to a staff member in the Office of Admissions & Student Affairs, the Associate Dean of Admissions & Student Affairs, the PA Program Director and the University General Counsel. 7. Tests will be repeated annually and the cost covered by the program; the cost of subsequent tests required by clinical sites will be the responsibility of the student. Student Health Services Physician Assistant students may utilize the Student Health Service for preventive services and personal health concerns. For patient privacy and confidentiality, PA students must not be treated by PA faculty who may occasionally cover the clinic. The student should identify themselves as a PA student when checking into the clinic so that they may be scheduled with a non-faculty provider. Computer and iPad Policy Computers and iPads distributed by the program are considered program property until graduation. Computers and iPads distributed by the program must be used for program related curriculum, emails, and clinical rotations. The use of alternate devices is not permitted. Program computers and iPads must not be sold. Violation of this policy is considered a breach of professionalism and will result in administrative probation and possible dismissal.Technical Standards for Admission The Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC- PA) requires all Physician Assistant (PA) programs to publish technical standards for admission. \"Technical Standards\" as defined in Section 504 of the Act, \"refers to all nonacademic admissions criteria that are essential to participate in the program in question.\" All PA students must possess the intellectual, ethical, physical, and emotional capabilities required to undertake the full curriculum and to achieve the levels of competence required by the faculty. Because these standards describe essential functions that students must demonstrate to meet the requirements of PA education, they are prerequisites for entrance, continuation, promotion, and graduation from the PA program. The use of an intermediary, a person trained to perform essential skills on behalf of the student, is not permitted. The following technical standards are adapted from the AAMC guidelines. Candidates for admission to and graduation from the Campbell PA Program should possess the following abilities: Observation The candidate must be able to observe required demonstrations and experiments in the basic sciences, including but not limited to anatomic dissection, microscopic studies, and patient demonstrations. A candidate must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Observation necessitates the functional use of the sense of vision, hearing, and somatic sensation. Communication A candidate must be able to speak, to hear, and to observe patients in order to elicit information, describe changes in mood, activity, and posture, and perceive non-verbal communication. A candidate must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients. Communication includes not only speech, but also reading and writing in English. The candidate must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in oral and written form with all members of the health care team.84 2014-2015 Academic Bulletin Motor Abilities A candidate must have sufficient motor function to carry out the basic laboratory techniques and to elicit information from patients by palpation, auscultation, percussion, and other diagnostic maneuvers, perform dissection of a human cadaver, and have sufficient motor ability to use a microscope. A candidate should be able to perform a complete physical examination (including pelvic and rectal examination); diagnostic procedures (e.g., venipuncture and basic laboratory tests such as urinalysis). A candidate must be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to provide general care and emergency treatment to patients. Examples of treatment reasonably required of physician assistants are cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the administration of intravenous medication, the application of pressure to stop bleeding, the suturing of simple wounds, assisting in surgical operations, and the performance of simple, general obstetrical and gynecological procedures. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium and functional use of the senses of touch, vision, and hearing. Intellectual, Conceptual, Integrative, and Quantitative Abilities Problem solving, the critical skill demanded of physician assistants, requires that a candidate be able to learn, retrieve, analyze sequence, organize, synthesize and integrate information efficiently, and reason effectively. In addition a candidate should possess the ability to measure and calculate accurately, to perceive three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures. Behavioral and Social Attributes A candidate must possess the emotional health required for full utilization of his or her intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients, and the development of mature, sensitive and effective relationships with patients and their family members, staff, and colleagues. Each candidate must be able to work effectively as a member of a health care team. Candidates must be able to tolerate physically taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. They must be able to adapt to changing environments, to display flexibility and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, collegiality, interest, and motivation are all personal qualities that are assessed during the admission and education processes. Accepted students with a disability who believe they may require special accommodations should contact the Coordinator for Academic Support Services immediately upon accepting the offer of admissions. Before matriculation, accepted students must attest in writing that they have read and are able to meet the program's technical standards. Academic Standards Academic Performance and Standards Committee The Academic Performance and Standard Committee (APSC) of the Campbell University Physician Assistant program consist of the principal faculty: the program director (chair), medical director, academic coordinators, clinical coordinator, and general faculty members. The committee meets prior to the end of each semester to review the academic standing of each student. Prior to the end of the didactic year the APSC convenes to recommend students for advancement to the clinical year; it convenes again prior to the end of the clinical phase to recommend students for graduation. The committee will also be convened at any point in the program at the recommendation of a faculty member to discuss a student whose performance is at risk for not meeting standards. Retention and Promotion Criteria Students enrolled in the Physician Assistant program are expected to make satisfactory academic progress toward completion of degree requirements. Satisfactory academic progress is defined as successful completion of all required courses and completion of all deficiencies and/or required remedial programs in the time and manner prescribed by the Physician Assistant program faculty. Students who fail to maintain satisfactory academic progress will be placed on academic probation. Students on academic probation will be required to participate in academic counseling and/or in a remedial program of study. Remediation Students having academic difficulty can request tutoring by contacting the Coordinator for Academic Support Services at no cost. For an appointment call 910- 814-5693. Advisors may refer students for tutoring as part of a remediation plan. 1. Exam Remediation It is required that each student has a satisfactory understanding of all course material presented during the program in order to be a competent clinician. A student who fails an exam with a grade of less than 70% will meet with his/her faculty advisor or course coordinator, as directed by the academic coordinator. The meeting should include a review of the student's study habits. The student must complete a written or practical remedial exam within two weeks, to ensure content competency. The completed remedial exercise will be placed in the student's file. The exam grade will not be changed. 2. Unit Remediation Clinical Medicine I, II, and III courses are composed of several units. In each unit there will be one or more exams. If a student receives a failing unit grade he or she must meet with his or her advisor. The student must successfully pass a remedial written or practical exam within two weeks of unit failure. If the student successfully remediates the unit, the grade will remain unchanged; however, the student will not be placed on academic probation. If the student fails to successfully remediate the material in the prescribed time he/she will be placed on academic probation. 3. Course Grades Students must successfully complete all required courses of the Physician Assistant program with a minimum grade of 70%. A student who fails any one course will be placed on academic probation. The student will be given one opportunity to remediate the course. The student must successfully pass a remedial written or practical exam within two weeks www .campbell.edu/cphs 85 PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT PROGRAMin order to continue in the program. After successful remediation the course grade will be advanced to 70%. Failure to successfully remediate the course in the prescribed manner and time will result in dismissal from the program. Failure of any second course during the didactic year is not remediable and will result in dismissal from the program. Remediation Records A record of all student remediation exercises will be kept in the student's file. A record of remediation for each semester is kept in a flow sheet in the program files. Academic Probation Academic probation is the initial action for a student failing to make satisfactory academic progress. A student will be placed on academic probation for: 1. Failure to successfully remediate a unit in which he or she received a grade of less than 70%, or 2. Failure of one didactic course with a grade of less than 70%, which was successfully remediated. A student placed on academic probation will be on probation for the semester. A didactic year student on probation will be required to meet with his/her advisor to develop a remedial study plan. The advisor may recommend referral to student services for tutoring, restricting participation in non-academic clubs, and committees or a combination of interventions. Any student who is placed on academic probation for two consecutive semesters will be dismissed from the program. Academic Dismissal Students will be dismissed from the Physician Assistant program for the following: 1. Failure to successfully remediate an initial course failure, in which the student received a grade of less than 70%, 2. Failure of a second course, or 3. Being placed on academic probation in two consecutive didactic semesters. Students who are dismissed from the pro - gram have three (3) business days to appeal the decision to the associate dean for stu - dent affairs. The associate dean will review the case within seven (7) business days and deliver a decision. The decision of the associ - ate dean for student affairs is final. Students who are dismissed must return the program provided laptop, iPad mini, identi - fication card, name tags, and the Campbell logo patch. Administrative Probation Regardless of academic standing, a didactic phase or clinical phase student may be placed on administrative probation at any time for unprofessional behavior or activity. Students on administrative probation will be required to engage in counseling as determined by the APSC and sign a probation contract. Counseling must be satisfactorily completed, as determined by the APSC, in order for the student to be removed from administrative probation. A didactic phase or clinical phase student will be placed on administrative probation for: 1. Failure to demonstrate appropriate professional attitudes and behaviors, or 2. Documented behaviors that would preclude professional licensure. Administrative Dismissal A student on administrative probation who fails to complete and/or respond to required counseling in the required time will be dismissed from the program. A student on administrative probation who fails to comply with the terms of the probation, or who repeatedly demonstrates unprofessional behavior will, upon recommendation of the APSC, be presented to the Campbell University Behavioral Intervention Team (CUBIT). After discussion of the circumstances for probation and dismissal, the CUBIT will either uphold the recommendation for dismissal or recommend further investigation and/or counseling. Students who are dismissed from the program have three (3) business days to appeal the decision to the associate dean for student affairs. The associate dean will review the case within seven (7) business days and deliver a decision. The decision of the associate dean for student affairs is final.Students who are dismissed must return the program provided laptop, iPad mini, identification card, name tags, and the Campbell logo patch. Academic or administrative probation, counseling, and remediation are not to be viewed as punitive, but as a means to help the student succeed. These measures are instituted in recognition that given the responsibilities of a healthcare professional, it is untenable for the program to advance a student who is not performing at a satisfactory level. Clinical Year Remediation End-of-Rotation Exam Remediation: The final grade for clinical rotations is a combination of exam grades, preceptor evaluation, written assignments, and clinical coordinator's evaluation, as outlined in the course syllabus. During the clinical phase of training, students may only remediate two failed end-of-rotation exams by passing a written remedial exam. If the student fails to successfully remediate either of the two failed end-of-rotation exam, s/he will be placed on academic probation for the remainder of the clinical phase of training. Failure of a third end-of-rotation exam is not remediable and is grounds for dismissal. A student placed on clinical year probation who fails any subsequent clinical course will be dismissed from the program. Preceptor Evaluation Clinical preceptor grades are an integral part of assessment of clinical year students. Clinical year students who receive a failing grade from a preceptor on any rotation may be placed on probation, after review of the situation by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee (APSC). Students who receive a failing grade from a second preceptor evaluation will be brought before the APSC. The APSC will evaluate the specific circumstances of each preceptor evaluation. If the APSC decides that the evaluations are evidence that the student is unprepared for the rigors of clinical practice, the student will be dismissed from the program. 86 2014-2015 Academic Bulletin Course Remediation: Failure of a clinical rotation with a grade of less than 70% requires repeating the rotation and the student will be put on academic probation. Mandatory repeating of the clinical rotation will result in delay of graduation from the program. The student will incur additional tuition costs for the repeat rotation. Failure of a second clinical rotation is evidence that the student is unprepared for the rigors of clinical practice and will result in dismissal of the student from the program. Clinical Year Probation Clinical year students on probation will be required to meet with their advisor to develop a comprehensive written remedial study plan to assure comprehension of the core material. Students will be placed on academic probation for: 1. Failing to successfully remediate an end-of-rotation exam failure, or 2. Failing a clinical rotation with a grade of less than 70%. 3. Failing a preceptor evaluation for any rotation. Clinical Year Dismissal Clinical students will be dismissed from the Physician Assistant program for the following: 1. Being placed on clinical year probation twice during the clinical phase of the program, 2. Failure of a second clinical rotation, 3. Failure of twopreceptor evaluations, following review by, and on recommendation of the APSC. 4. Failure of a third end-of-rotation exam, or 5. Failure to complete and/or respond to required counseling as a result of administrative probation. Academic Status Appeals Any student in the Physician Assistant program has the opportunity to appeal any decision made by the APSC. Students desiring to appeal a decision rendered by the APSC must submit a written petition to the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences' associate dean of academic affairs within seven days of the student's receipt of notification of the APSC decision. The decision of the associate dean is final.Grade Appeals Students who feel that they have a just reason for appealing a grade in a Department of Physician Assistant Practice course must first appeal to the course coordinator. If no resolution is achieved at the level of the course coordinator a student may appeal to the program director within seven days of notification of the grade. If the student feels the program director's resolution is not just, the student must submit a written petition to the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences' associate dean of academic affairs within seven days of the student's receipt of notification of the program director's decision. The petition must contain the specific variance requested and a description of any extenuating circumstances intended to justify granting the variance. The decision of the associate dean is final. Test Question Appeal Students who contend the answer to a test question may appeal to the course coordinator, within three days of the exam grade being posted. The appeal must be accompanied by at least two peer-reviewed references. The decision of the course coordinator is final. Service Hours Service to the program, college, university, community, and profession is an integral part of the Campbell mission of faith, learning, and service. Physician Assistant students are required to earn 25 service-learning hours, during the first year of study, as part of the didactic curriculum. Service hours can be earned by participating in college health fairs, the Buies Creek Elementary school health fair, PA day activities, the annual Charity Golf Tournament, adopt-a-highway program, and serving as hosts during open houses or Marshalls at graduation, among other activities. Students may also submit verified hours from service to their local churches or community groups. In addition to all other components required for successful completion of the didactic year, completion of the 25 mandatory service hours must be accomplished by the end of the Clinical Year Orientation week each year in order to advance to the clinical year and begin rotations. Failure to complete the hours as required may delay graduation.Advancement to the Clinical Year Advancement to the clinical year requires faculty approval and attainment of the following requirements: 1. Successful completion of all courses, 2. Maintenance of a 70% or greater overall grade average, 3. Successful completion of the didactic year summative evaluations, and 4. Completion of 25 hours of required service learning. Graduation Requirements Recommendation for graduation requires faculty approval and attainment of the following requirements: 1. Successful completion of all courses, requirements, and remediation, 2. Successful completion of the Campbell PA program PANCE board review seminar, and 3. Successful completion of all summative clinical year evaluations. Graduation after Deceleration PA Students who decelerate due to probation, repeating a clinical rotation, or approved medical leave, and are in good academic standing, may walk at the graduation ceremony with their original cohort if they lack no more than five hours of credit (one clinical rotation). The outstanding credit must be completed no later than March 15 of the year immediately following the original graduation date. Students who lack more than five hours of credit, or miss the deadline for completion, will be able to walk at the next graduation ceremony after completion of their outstanding requirements. Students who decelerate will receive their degree at the next University awarding period; either the May, August, or December graduation dates. Students may sit for their NCCPA boards and apply for North Carolina licensure once all program requirements have been met, and the program director releases their names to the appropriate boards. All academic, clinical, and remedial work must be completed within three years of matriculating in the PA program. Students who have outstanding work after three years may reapply for admission, as described under the academic dismissal policy.www .campbell.edu/cphs 87 PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT PROGRAMEmployment while in the Program 1 Outside employment during the didactic or clinical phases of the PA program is strongly discouraged. 2. Required program activities cannot be altered by outside activities. Outside obligations cannot interfere or impede class attendance or completion of assignments of program requirements. 3. Students are not permitted to perform any clerical, administrative, or physical work for the PA program or be employed as a graduate assistant. 4. Students must not substitute for faculty or staff by performing any administrative, clerical, or clinical duties while on supervised clinical educational rotations. Assignment Completion All course assignments must be turned in by the date and time posted by the instructor. A late penalty of 5-points per day will deducted from the assignment grade. Unless specific reasons for late submissions are approved in advance by the instructor, an assignment that is more than 6 days late will not be accepted and the student will receive a zero for the assignment. Exam Protocol - Late for an Exam It is unacceptable to be late for an exam as it is disruptive for the rest of the class. Students must be in their seats and have their computers set up before the posted exam time (usually on the hour). Students who are late for an exam must not enter the exam room; those students must report to the PA office suite. They will be set up in a location provided by faculty, or other proctors, who may be available. For a first offense the earned grade will be awarded. For any subsequent exam tardiness, students up to 15 minutes late will be dropped one letter grade for the exam. Students more than 15 minutes late (usually 15 minutes after the hour) will not be allowed to take the exam and will receive a zero for the exam.

Graduates will receive the Master of Physician Assistant Practice (MPAP) degree upon successful completion. The program starts in mid- August. Graduation is in December, after 7 semesters of study and training. All didactic courses are held on the main campus. The PA program curriculum is a competency-based graduate medical education curriculum. The sequence of courses is designed to start with foundation courses in the basic sciences as well as clinical skills. Following the initial foundational coursework, subsequent courses teach clinical medical, surgical and pharmacotherapeutical concepts. Curriculum content is vertically integrated such that the study of topics in a specific clinical discipline, such as cardiology, includes cardiac history and physical exam, cardiology in clinical medicine, cardiology diagnostics such as EKG and appropriate laboratories, and cardiology pharmacotherapeutics. The newly developed Clinical Skills Courses will compliment this integrated curriculum through regular exercises in critical thinking such as clinical case studies, simulation activities and objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs). Early clinical experience opportunities are also interspersed throughout the didactic year. Assessment of students in the first year is by written examinations, performance on laboratory practical examinations, and participation in small group activities as well as final summative exams. The clinical rotations in the second year are five-week supervised clerkship experiences in the major disciplines, a seminar in evidence-based medicine and two clinical electives. Evaluation of clinical-year students includes a preceptor assessment of performance, and student performance on written examinations or presentations given at the end of each required clinical rotation. There are final summative exams at the conclusion of the clinical year which are prerequisites for graduation.All students complete all didactic elements in the program at the same time. All students must complete all required clinical experiences. The only elective study available in this curriculum is in the second year when students may undertake supervised clinical experiences in two five- week rotations of their choosing. Curriculum design and operationalization is guided by the standards of accreditation for physician assistant education, as published by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC-PA). The ARC-PA accreditation standards describe the required curricular components and required supervised clinical experiences for a program to receive accreditation. The curriculum described is designed to meet these accreditation requirements.

Students enrolled in the clinical research and pharmaceutical sciences programs, who will be participating in training activities at various sites or organizations, may also be required to submit to a criminal background check if required by the organization providing the experiential training. CPHS will contract with an outside vendor for the performance of the background check, and students may be assessed a fee to cover the cost of the background check. In subsequent years, a background check on doctor of pharmacy students will be performed during the second professional year (P2), prior to the introductory practice experience, and during the third professional year (P3) prior to beginning advanced practice experiences. For physician assistant students, a background check will be repeated prior to beginning the second year supervised clinical practice experiences Certain offenses may result in the student not being able to be placed by the College at supervised clinical education sites. In such cases, the student may not be able to meet the requirements for graduation. Also certain offenses may preclude professional licensure. Therefore, applicants to the doctor of pharmacy and physician assistant programs will be notified of the background check requirement as part of the application process. All interviewed applicants will be given a copy of the policy and an authorization/waiver will be obtained. Students who are not willing to allow the release of the required personal information may not be able to be placed at an affiliated clinical education site, and thus cannot meet the requirements for graduation. A copy of the student's criminal background check may be required by the site providing the clinical educational experience of the doctor of pharmacy or physician assistant student. The health care facility or clinical site has the right to make the final determination whether the student may participate at their site. The site has the right to refuse to allow the student to complete a rotation at the respective site. All criminal background data will be maintained in a secure location to assure confidentiality. Routine access to the information will be limited to a staff member in the office of Admissions & Students Affairs, the associate dean of admissions & student affairs, director of experiential education, physician assistant clinical coordinator, and the University general counsel. The College will notify students of findings as required by law. Procedure 1. A criminal background check will be completed on all pharmacy and physician assistant accepted applicants prior to matriculation 2. Accepted applicants and selected wait listed applicants will receive a letter from the College with detailed information about these requirements. The letter will explain the contingency that the final decision regarding matriculation will be made after review of the applicant's criminal background check report. 3. Appropriate authorization, with pertinent identifying information necessary to initiate the check, will be received from each accepted applicant prior to initiating a criminal background check. This authorization will inform the accepted applicant that he or she will have access to criminal background check data about himself or herself to ensure the accuracy of the criminal background check report. 4. Ultimate decisions regarding matriculation of an accepted applicant whose criminal background check reveals information of concern will be made by CPHS in consultation with the University's general counsel. 5. No information derived from a criminal background check will automatically disqualify any accepted applicant from matriculation. A final decision about matriculation will be made only after a careful review of factors including: the nature, circumstances and frequency of any offenses, length of time since the offenses, documented successful rehabilitation and the accuracy of the information provided by the applicant in his or her application materials. 6. Information from these reports that is unrelated to decisions about admissions and continued enrollment will be maintained in the Office of the Dean and will not become part of the students' permanent file. 7. Information obtained will only be used in accordance with state and federal laws. 8. Enrolled students are required to disclose any misdemeanor or felony convictions other than, minor traffic violations, including deferred adjudication, within thirty days of occurrence to the Office of Admissions & Student Affairs. Dress Code Proper professional attire signals to patients and other health professionals a student's self-confidence, knowledge level, and willingness to participate in responsible decision making processes. The short-length white lab coat is required for health care professionals in training. During the first three didactic years of the PharmD program, \"business casual\" attire is appropriate for classroom and examination sessions. Business casual attire for men includes collared shirts and khaki or dress slacks; for women knee-length skirts or dress slacks with tailored blouses. The following dress and accessories are unacceptable in the clinic and classroom: hats, caps, t-shirts, men's sleeveless shirts, blue jeans, sweat pants, athletic attire, tank tops, bare midriffs, and visible tattoos or any body piercing (other than earrings). 106 2014-2015 Academic Bulletin Formal Grievance Policy for ACPE Concerns Students who have concerns regarding the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences' capability to achieve the standards of accreditation or comply with policies and procedures of the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) may file a grievance with the Office of Admissions & Student Affairs.

Students may monitor decisions made through the University's inclement weather website, www. campbell.edu/weather. Students will also receive an email once a decision is made about the occurrence of classes. Students are encouraged to use their own good judgment relative to safety in traveling to campus. Should classes meet and students who commute are unable to travel safely to the campus, they will not be penalized and will be able to make-up missed work. Infection Control Immunizations During introductory and advanced pharmacy practice experiences and physician assistant clinical rotations, students will be involved in direct patient care and therefore at risk for potential exposure to infectious materials and patients. Prior to registration, students must provide proof of the immunizations/ immunity requirements listed below.Requirements Tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis: Td booster within the past 10 years. Students must have a one-time dose of Tdap unless contraindicated. Students must have booster protection across all years enrolled in the program (i.e. lapses in coverage between boosters are unacceptable). Polio: Complete IPV or OPV series MMR: Two doses or laboratory evidence of immunity to each of the three diseases Hepatitis A: Two-vaccination series required before the end of the first professional year, students must provide documentation of the second dose. Hepatitis B: Students must show documentation of a three-dose series with the first of the three doses upon admission to CPHS. Before the end of the first professional year, students must provide documentation of the second and third doses in a series. Varicella (chicken pox): Students must either receive the two-series Varicella vaccination or prove immunity to the Varicella virus by a positive (+) blood titer. Individuals utilizing blood titer as proof must submit a copy of the actual lab result. History of \"chicken pox\" in your medical is not sufficient. Tuberculin (PPD) skin test: Annually (some rotations sites require a 2-step PPD - CPHS will let the student know if this applies.) If the TB skin test is positive a chest X-ray is required. Influenza: Annual flu vaccine is required. Standard Precautions The Center of Disease Control (CDC) has developed a list of the following precautions to prevent accidental spread of infectious diseases to both students and patients: Hand washing (or using an antiseptic hand rub) After touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions and contaminated items Immediately after removing gloves between patient contact Gloves For contact with blood, body fluids, secretions and contaminated items For contact with mucous membranes and non-intact skinwww .campbell.edu/cphs 107 GENERAL INFORMATIONMasks, goggles, face masks Protect mucous membranes of eyes, nose and mouth when contact with blood and body fluids is likely Gowns Protect skin from blood or body fluid contact Prevent soiling of clothing during procedures that may involve contact with blood or body fluids Linen Handle soiled linen to prevent touching skin or mucous membranes Do not pre-rinse soiled lindens in patient care areas Patient care equipment Handle soiled equipment in a manner to prevent contact with skin or mucous membranes and to prevent contamination of clothing or the environment Clean reusable equipment prior to reuse Environmental cleaning Routinely care, clean and disinfect equipment and furnishings in patient care areas Sharps Avoid recapping used needles, use self- capping safety needles if available Avoid removing used needles from disposable syringes Avoid bending, breaking or manipulating used needles by hand Place used sharps in puncture-resistant containers Patient resuscitation Use mouthpieces, resuscitation bags or other ventilation devise to avoid mouth to mouth resuscitation Patient placement Place patients who contaminate the environment or cannot maintain appropriate hygiene in private rooms OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Training CPHS requires that all students who have contact with patients view the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens (BBP) training video. Copies of student training records will be kept in the office of each respective professional program.Tuberculosis Training-Physician Assistant Students Only Physician assistant students will receive training for preventing the transmission of tuberculosis (TB) annually. All students who have the potential for exposure to TB may be fit tested for National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) certified personal respirator protective devices, as required by clinical sites. These devices are considered personal protective equipment and must be purchased by the student. Personal Illness Students presenting signs or symptoms of infectious or communicable diseases have a duty not to spread illness to others. Students should consult Student Health Services (910-893-1516), their preceptor, clinical supervisor or the infection control office at the clinical site about the advisability of working with patients and when it is safe to return to patient care. Incident Reporting Body Fluid and Needle Stick Policy and Procedure Incidents involving needle sticks and exposure to body fluids or potential bloodborne pathogens require immediate action to protect students' health and safety. If a student sustains a needle stick or is exposed to infectious materials he or she should: 1. Immediately wash exposure site thoroughly with soap and water (or water only for mucous membranes) Wash needle stick and cuts with soap and water Flush the nose, mouth or skin with water Irrigate eyes with clean water, saline or sterile irrigants 2. Notify the preceptor or clinical supervisor at the rotation site for assistance For pharmacy students the preceptor should notify the Office of Experiential Education by phone, 800-760-9697, or email (Jean White ext. 1709/email: whitej@campbell.edu or Paige Brown ext. 5611/ email brownp@campbell. edu) as soon as reasonably possible to begin the process of filing an incident report.For physician assistant students the preceptor should notify the PA clinical coordinator by phone, 910-893-1252 or email, gerstnerl@campbell.edu , or the PA department's office, 910-893-1210, as soon as reasonably possible to begin the process of filing an incident report. 3. Seek immediate care for necessary lab work and post-exposure prophylaxis In the event that the rotation site has an existing exposure policy, the student should comply with the site's policy. If the rotation site is not able to assist the student, the student should seek care at the nearest available facility to provide appropriate care (initial lab work for HIV, HBV, HCV and risk assessment to determine the need for chemoprophylaxis, etc.) or students may be seen at Campbell University's Student Health Service. 4. The preceptor or appropriate institutional representative should obtain consent from the source patient for appropriate laboratory testing (i.e. HIV, HBV, and HCV status). Students should receive post-exposure prophylaxis within hours of the exposure rather than days, per CDC recommendations, if the status of the source patient is deemed high risk or if there is uncertainty of the source patient's status. 5. Some clinical sites will provide post exposure care to students at no charge. When this is not the case, needle sticks and other exposure are covered under the Campbell University Student Accident Insurance Policy. Accidental infectious exposure must be reported as directed in this policy: The accident policy is underwritten by Guarantee Trust Life Insurance Company and administered by First Agency, Inc. First Agency, Inc. 5071 West H Avenue Kalamazoo, When presenting to a clinic for post- exposure care, the student may provide the above policy information and his or her student ID card. However, the site may or may not accept direct payment through this plan. Students may have to pay out of pocket at the time of service. However, reimbursement for services up to $5,000 per incident can be filed via Student Health Services. Students will need: To provide an itemized statement complete with diagnosis and procedure codes Complete a claim form either in person, or call Student Health Services at 910-893-1560. The staff will be glad to help you fill out the form by email correspondence. Student Health Services personnel will provide further instruction on how to complete and file your claim. If requested, mail documents to: Campbell University Student Health Service PO Box 565 Buies Creek, NC 27506 Students may opt to use their personal health insurance to cover the cost of post-exposure care in lieu of using the Campbell University Student Accident Insurance Policy. 6. Although, the preceptor or clinical supervisor may have contacted CPHS as indicated above, the student must also contact the Office of Experiential Education or the Physician Assistant Department Office as soon as reasonably possible but within a minimum of 72 hours of the exposure to finalize the incident report. The incident report shall contain: The date and time of exposure Clinical site, location and unit information Details of how the exposure occurred Details of the type and severity of the exposure Details about the source patient (i.e. post-exposure management, previous vaccinations, current HIV, HBV, HCV status) The Office Experiential Education or the Physician Assistant Department Office will provide a copy of the incident report to Student Health Services. This will alert the Student Health Services in the event that an accident insurance claim needs to be filled. In the event that an incident report was filed at the rotation site, a copy of this must be sent to the Office of Experiential Education or the Physician Assistant Department Office to be maintained in the student's file. 7. In the event of an exposure, the National Clinician's Post Exposure Prophylaxis Hotline is available by phone, 888-448- 4911, 24 hours per day, seven days per week, to provide guidance in managing exposures. Sexual Harassment Sexual harassment is a violation of the University's mission statement, code of honor and student code. Sexual harassment includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other physical and expressive behavior of a sexual nature in which: Submission to such conduct becomes a term or condition of an individual's employment or education; Submission to such conduct becomes a basis for academic or employment evaluation; Conduct creates a hostile, intimidating, offensive or demeaning employment or educational environment. Sexual harassment represents a form of abuse and/or intimidation and will be dealt with accordingly under the Student Code of Conduct, General Standards of Conduct, Article 6. It is recommended that students experiencing sexual harassment contact the associate dean of academic affairs or the associate dean of admissions & student affairs. However, students may contact any appropriate administrator and may bypass anyone who may be the subject of the complaint. A thorough investigation of complaints will be conducted, and there will be no retaliation for making complaints.Honor Code We, the students, staff and faculty of Campbell University's College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (CPHS), recognize that health care related professions are among the most noble and honorable callings to which one may aspire. These are professions that demand of their members the highest degree of professional competence, ethical behavior, and morality. They require continuous educational development, constant personal and professional self- examination, and an ever-present awareness and sensitivity to human problems. It is the responsibility of every health care related professional, from the day that his or her professional career begins, to seek to achieve the highest aspirations and goals inherent in the profession; to exhibit honor and integrity in the use of his or her special skills for the betterment of humankind; and to act at all times in a manner which will instill public confidence in the profession. We therefore adopt this Honor Code in an attempt to set forth the minimum standards by which our conduct should be governed. Article 1: Academic Matters A. General Statement Recognizing that it is impossible and inadvisable to set forth with specificity a range of conduct that is prohibited, we nevertheless realize that questions arise occasionally with respect to what a student may or may not do in connection with an academic matter. This Honor Code therefore sets forth the minimum standards of conduct with the hope and expectation that a CPHS student will never approach, and certainly never fall below, these minimum standards. It is the obligation of the students and faculty to participate in making the honor system viable by reporting violations of all academic matters. B. Definition An academic matter means any one of the following: any activity which may affect a grade in a course; any activity which in any way contributes to satisfaction of the requirements of a course, or requirements for graduation, or co-curricular activities of an academic nature including student publication and competitions. www .campbell.edu/cphs 109 GENERAL INFORMATIONC. Prohibited Activities with Respect to Academic Matters CPHS students shall not: 1. Use materials during an examination other than those specifically authorized by the instructor.

Use of materials in any research or assignment that are specifically forbidden by the instructor. This includes reuse of the student's own work. 3. Engage in any form of plagiarism. Plagiarism is using the words or ideas of another source directly without proper acknowledgment of that source. While it is often necessary to obtain information from other sources, the willful or inadvertent use of information from another source without acknowledging it (including all types of commercial term paper preparation services; internet or electronic database sources for term papers, journal clubs, or case presentations; and other students' work) is considered plagiarism. Ignorance is not an excuse. The student bears the responsibility to learn from the individual instructor the procedure for acknowledging sources and indicating quotations as required for each assignment. 4. Give, solicit, or receive information or assistance to or from any person or source during an examination, makeup examination, or written assignment unless specifically authorized to do so by the instructor. 5.

General Statement The associate dean of admissions & student affairs is responsible for the administration of the CPHS disciplinary system. This responsibility is exercised on behalf of the president of the University and entails the supervision of several bodies. Alleged violations of the University's student code of conduct or civil laws will be handled by the University policies as written in the Campbell University Student Handbook. Alleged violations of the CPHS Honor Code will be evaluated by the Student Affairs Committee. B. Organization The Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee is composed of faculty members from each department, students and the director of admissions & student affairs (ex-officio). An ad-hoc member will be chosen to replace any member who cannot or chooses not to attend the proceedings. The associate dean of admissions & student affairs will appoint this member. This committee serves as a hearing board for incidents of misconduct involving violations of the Honor Code. The Honor Code includes standards for academic, non-academic, and clinical behavior. The Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee will make recommendations to the associate dean of admissions & student affairs. The associate dean of admissions & student affairs will then notify the student in writing of actions concerning alleged violations. A record of disciplinary actions is normally maintained by the dean's office until the student graduates or leaves CPHS. Students may examine the contents of their file by appointment with the director of admissions & student affairs. C. Instigation of Hearings When there is a suspicion of academic misconduct, investigation and appropriate actions may be pursued by either the professor of the course in which the alleged misconduct occurred or by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. In either case, the matter must be promptly resolved. If the professor decides to deal with the incident, he or she should report the student's actions to the chair of the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. Individual faculty policies concerning misconduct should be clearly stated in the course syllabus. The accused student has the right to appeal any action by the faculty member to the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee, in which normal committee procedures will be followed. Charges of misconduct may arise from a student (or group of students), professor, adjunct professor or preceptor. Within seven (7) days of the alleged misconduct or discovery of alleged misconduct, the accuser(s) should discuss the situation with either the director of admissions & student affairs or the professor in charge of the course. Dated notes should be taken to describe the discussion. Every effort should be made to maintain confidentiality in these discussions. If the accuser(s) has (have) opted to bring the matter before the director of admissions & student affairs, the director should meet with the professor and the chairperson of the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee to explore options. This meeting should take place no longer than seven (7) days after the matter was brought to the attention of the director. The options available for resolution of the situation include: 1. The professor can opt to deal with the situation, in which case the student(s) www .campbell.edu/cphs 111 GENERAL INFORMATIONmust be informed of allegations and afforded an opportunity to defend him or herself. 2 .The case can be referred to the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee for resolution. Referral to the committee must be by a written memo which names the student, describes the alleged misconduct (including pertinent dates and times), and summarizes the content of earlier meetings regarding this case. 3. The case may be dismissed. Within five (5) days of referral of the case to the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee, the chair of the committee will provide a copy of the referral memo to the accused student(s). In addition, the chairperson will schedule an initial hearing for any charged student with the committee. This hearing should be held within ten (10) days of the referral of the case to the committee. D. Proceedings The chair will begin preliminary investig- ation of the allegations. Whenever pos- sible, this should include a personal interview with the student, witnesses and professor involved. Preliminary findings shall be presented at the initial meeting with the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. The chair shall objectively present his or her findings to the committee. The accused student(s) shall meet with the committee and be informed of the allegations and afforded an opportunity to defend him or herself. Although the purpose of this hearing is exploratory and fact finding in nature, the accused student does have the right to solicit advice and to offer witnesses to support his or her position. The committee shall vote on whether or not preliminary findings warrant a full hearing by a simple majority vote. If a hearing is deemed necessary, the chair will notify the student and witnesses of the hearing date in writing at least three (3) days prior to the hearing. A waiver of his or her notice may be made if the student so chooses. A full hearing should be held within ten (10) days of the preliminary committee review. If the committee votes that no hearing is warranted, the case will be dismissed.

All sessions of the committee will be closed to all individuals except those immediately concerned in the case, except by the expressed wish of the accused that the hearings be open. No attorney shall be present, as this is not a court of law. In case of a closed hearing, all persons present at the proceedings shall be bound to disclose no more than the committee does in its official report on the case. Revelation of such details will be considered a violation of the Honor Code. In the case of closed hearings, the testimony of each witness shall be given while the other witnesses in the case are out of the room. In open hearings, the witnesses of both parties shall be present during the entire proceedings.

The student should be informed immediately of the judgment and the recommended penalty in case of guilt. The associate dean of admissions & student affairs may uphold or reject any decision or penalty recommended by the committee. A letter from the associate dean's office will serve as the official notice of judgment and sentence. All minutes and evidence shall be placed in the permanent files of the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee, and a copy will be sent to the associate dean of admissions & student affairs office where it shall remain until the student graduates or leaves CPHS.

Article 9: Student Clinical Code of Conduct CPHS students and faculty have adopted the following code of conduct to guide ethical behavior in hospitals, community pharmacies, research and production facilities, and various rotation sites included as clinical practice experiences. We feel that the magnitude of our responsibility as health care professionals necessitates the establishment of the highest standards of professional conduct. This code of conduct represents general standards of behavior and illustrates ideals for which to strive; however, specific infractions reported by students, preceptors or faculty to the chair of the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee may be investigated by this committee with respect to both the magnitude and chronicity of incidents considered. It should also be understood that these general standards may not afford guidance in every conceivable situation or anticipate every possible infraction. The Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee will be charged with the responsibility of promptly investigating alleged infractions of this code. All cases will require the submission of a report of findings and appropriate recommendations to the associate dean for admissions & student affairs in a timely manner. Students should read, discuss and sign the Honor Code prior to enrollment to CPHS. This code of conduct was created by the students and faculty of CPHS. Modifications of this code will require majority approval of both the faculty and student body. The students attending CPHS will meet the following guidelines: Respect and Concern for the Welfare of Patients 1. Treat patients and their families with respect and dignity both in their presence and in discussions with others. 2. Recognize when one's ability to function effectively is compromised and ask for relief or help. 3. Recognize the limits of student involvement in the medical care of a patient and seek supervision or advice before acting when necessary. 4. Not use alcohol or other drugs in a manner that could compromise themselves or patient care. Respect for the Rights of Others 1. Deal with professional, staff and peer members of the health care team in a considerate manner and with a spirit of cooperation. 2. Act with an egalitarian spirit toward all persons encountered in a professional capacity regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual preference or socioeconomic status. 3. Respect the patient's modesty and privacy. Trustworthiness 1. Be truthful in communication to others. 2. Maintain confidentiality of patient information. 3. Admit errors and not knowingly mislead others to promote one's self at the expense of the patient. 4. Not represent himself or herself as a pharmacist, physician, physician assistant, or other health professional. 5 Accurately acknowledge the sources for all information reported. Failure to do so will be considered plagiarism. Responsibility and Sense of Duty 1. Participate responsibly in patient care or research to the best of his or her ability and with the appropriate supervision. Undertake clinical duties and persevere until they are complete. 2. Notify the responsible person if something interferes with his or her ability to perform clinical or academic tasks effectively. Professional Demeanor 1. Maintain a neat and clean appearance, and dress in attire that is accepted as professional to the population served. 2. Be thoughtful and professional when interacting with patients and families. 3. Strive to maintain composure during times of fatigue, professional stress, or personal problems. 4. Avoid offensive language, gestures, or inappropriate remarks. 5. Adhere to the CPHS professional dress code Student Rights In addition to the standards we have adopted for the conduct of ourselves, we expect to be treated with respect as participants in the delivery of health care. CPHS students: 1. Should be challenged to learn, but should not be belittled, humiliated or abused in front of patients, peers or other health professionals. 2. Should not be sexually harassed, either verbally or physically. 3. Should not be discriminated against on the basis of gender, race, religion or sexual preference. 4. Should be a participant in patient care decisions whenever possible. 5. Should have his or her health care related education take priority over routine menial tasks. If a preceptor feels a student lacks adequate knowledge or skills, he or she has the responsibility to inform and instruct that student so he or she can improve his or her performance. If a student feels that a preceptor has committed infractions against the above standards, he or she has the responsibility of informing that preceptor, whether by direct contact or by way of an honest preceptor evaluation at the end of a rotation, of such feelings so that the preceptor can improve his or her performance. NOTE: The above standards of conduct are based on the Code of Conduct for Duke University Medical Students and have been adapted to meet the needs of CPHS. www .campbell.edu/cphs 113 GENERAL INFORMATIONArticle 10: Pledge A student's signature indicates that he or she agrees to uphold the following pledge.
