Since I have been undergoing treatment under the direction of Dr. Ruelas, I have never felt more alert, more focused and more ALIVE...so many of my problems [have turned out to] resolve around basic nutritional deficiencies. I highly recommend his services. Thank you Dr. Ruelas for helping me overcome my darkest day. Since I have been seeing you I feel I have gained my life and future back. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. When I started seeing Dr. Ruelas I had suffered with chronic illness for decades. I had been on numerous medication with little benefit. I feel younger and have more energy than I've had in years. THANK YOU Dr. Ruelas.\" You gave me patience when I had none left. You gave me hope when I lost sight of the light. Most of all, you helped me become whole again. "}
