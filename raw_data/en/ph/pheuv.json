Introduction A COVID -19 vaccination incident is any preventable event which could have or did lead to harm of a vaccine recipient . In the context of vaccination, incidents that may reduce vaccine effectiveness should also be regarded as having the potential to cause harm . COVID -19 vaccin ation incidents may be related to vaccine products, procedures and systems. They can include incidents involving communication, product labelling/packaging/nomenclature, preparation, distribution, storage, administration, education, monitoring, and use. The COVID -19 vaccines currently l isted in Datix C IMS ar e: C OVID BNT162b2 vaccine AstraZeneca ChAdOx1-S As new COVID -19 vaccines become available for use in Western Australia they will be added to Datix CIMS . The naming convention uses 'COVID -19 vaccine' at the beginning of the name for consistency. Some Health Service Providers (HSPs) have requested that specific locations relating to COVID -19 vaccination clinics be created in Datix CIMS. If you are unsure of the correct location to record for a clinical incident related to COVID- 19 vaccination, please contact your local clinical governance/safety and quality team for advice. There is a separate process for recording adverse reactions following vaccine administration. The Western Australian Vaccine Safety Surveillance system (WAVSS) is the central reporting service in WA for any significant adverse events/side effects that the vaccine recipient may experience following immunisa tion (please refer to Section 6 for further information) . Choosing the correct type of incident While many clinical incidents related to COVID- 19 vaccination are likely to be categorised as 'medication incidents' in Datix CIMS, it is possible that other incident types may be appropriate depending on the circumstances (e.g. an incident related to the COVID -19 vaccination booking system may be better categorised as 'Administrative Processes'). Please contact the Patient Safety Surveillance Unit (PSSU) via PSSU@health.wa.gov.au if you require assistance with the categorisation of clinical incidents related to COVID -19 vaccination in Datix CIMS. The remainder of this guidance document relates to COVID -19 vaccination clinical incidents that are categorised as medication incidents at incident type tier one. It is important to select the correct part of the medication process where the incident occurred from the incident type tier two drop- down list , as different tier th ree choices are available depending on the tier two option chosen ( see Appendix 1 for a list of descriptions of tier two and tier three categories that may be more frequently used for vaccination- related clinical incidents ). Datix CIMS Version 1.0 | April 2021 2 1. Incident type tier one : select 'Medication/Biologics/Fluids' when recording a vaccination related clinical incident. 2. What incident type do I select for tier two ? There are several options that can be selected for the tier two incident type for COVID -19 vaccine - related incidents. These include: Administration to Patient Delivery Processes Post-administration Patient Monitoring Preparation/Formulation Processes Procurement /Supplier Processes Storage Processes Please note that w hen reference is made to a 'Patient' in Datix CIMS incident t ype selections, this should be regarded as relating to the to 'vaccine recipient'. A vaccine recipient who is also employed in the WA health system is to be considered a 'patient' in this context. Note: Most COVID -19 vaccines will be administered under the Structured Administration and Supply Arrangements (SASA) and will not have an associated prescription for each dose. Therefore, the tier two categories of Prescribing Processes and Dispensing Process es will usually not be relevant for clinical incident s related to COVID -19 vaccines. Two incident types that are often confused are 'Administration to Patient' and 'Dispensing Process'. Tier two incident type Description Administration to Patient If a vaccine recipient has been administered a vaccine, then it is an 'Administration to Patient' incident type. It involves the 6 rights of medication/vaccine administration, encompass ing assessment /screening of suitability for the vaccine, the selection of the correc t vaccine and appropriate preparation and administration of the vaccine by a suitably skilled clinician to the correct person on each occasion. Documentation of administration in the vaccination clinic is to be captured in VaccinateWA . Dispensing Process es This step includes the process of dispensing the medication from a pharmacy undertaken by a pharmacist. Unless the vaccine has been dispensed for a specific COVID -19 vaccine recipient from the pharmacy department, the 'Dispensing Process es' tier two incident type will not be applicable for COVID -19 vaccines. Version 1.0 | April 2021 3 3.What incident type do I select for tier three? Please refer to Table 2 for some of the incident type tier three options that are most relevant to COVID -19 vaccines. 4.Choosing the COVID-19 vaccine involved Tip By typing 'COVID' in the M edication involved field , a list of COVID -19 vaccines will be shown in a drop- down list . Select the COVID -19 vaccine involved in the incident . DO NOT enter free text in the Medication involved field. 5.Clinical incident details When submitting a clinical incident , it is important to include as much information as possible about : what happened why the incident may have occurred what factors may have contributed to the incident occurring . These details will assist the review process to develop strategies to reduce the risk of similar incidents occurring again. Version 1.0 | April 2021 4 Incident Example 1: Incorrect dose administered. W as the reason for the incorrect dose because: The incorrect dose was drawn up into the syringe There was leakage between the needle and the syringe due to not securing the needle properly There was leakage between the needle and the syringe due to equipment failure. Incident Example 2: Several vials of vaccine w ere left outside of the fridge for an extended period of time . Was the reason for the stock experiencing a temperature excursion because: There was insufficient storage space in the fridge when a new delivery arrived The patients for whom the doses were allocated for did not show up for their appointments as expected There was a refrigeration failure The nurse was interrupted whilst taking stock out of the fridge There was a failure of the inventory management sy stem. 6.Recording Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) Existing WA vaccine surveillance structures will enable vaccine monitoring, assess vaccine effectiveness, and understand and address adverse events. The Western Australian Vaccine Safety Surveillance system (WAVSS) is the central reporting service in WA for any significant adverse events following immunisation (AEFI). All adverse reactions requiring treatment should be reported as soon as possible after the event, as per statutory requirement to notify adverse events after immunisation which is specified in the Public Health Act 2016 and the Public Health Regulations 2017 . The safety of COVID -19 vaccines will be monitored continuously throughout the rollout of the Vaccination Program. WAVSS will carefully monitor and respond to any safety issues identified, providing individual support to immunisation providers and clinical assi stance for families affected by an AEFI. AEFI can be reported online via www.safevac.org.au or by contacting WAVSS staff by phone on (08) 6456 0208 or email wavss@health.wa.gov.au . For detailed instructions, refer to the WAVSS reporting guide. When the Western Australian Vaccine Safety Surveillance (WAVSS) systemreceives a report from a patient on an adverse event following immunisation, WAVSS staff will: 1.Review the adverse event report and if necessary, contact the patient or reporter to gathermore information to determine if the patient requires further assessment. 2.If further assessment is required, WAVSS staff will refer them to the COVID -19 vaccine adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) Adult Immunology Clinic Sir CharlesGairdner Hospital (SCGH). 3.The COVID -19 vaccine AEFI Adult Immunologist will review and determine if they are able to be vaccinated without additional precautions (advised t o re-book their vaccination as done previously) or be vaccinated under observation at SCGH if deemed clinically appropriate. 4.For patients who are advised to re- book their vaccination as done previously, they will be provided with a letter from WAVSS and/or the Adult Immunology Clinic to bring with them totheir vaccination appointment. C OVID -19 vaccine common side effects indicate the start of an immune response, not an allergic reaction. Mild, short -term side effects from vaccination, including injection site reactions, fever, joint pain, muscle aches, fatigue, headaches, or worsened eczema a day after vaccination do not need to be reported to WAVSS. Version 1.0 | April 2021 5 Appendix 1 - Guidance for t ier two and tier three incident types Table 1 - Descriptions for t ier two incident types Tier two incident type Description Administration to Patient When a nurse, midwife or doctor administers a vaccine to a vaccine recipient. It involves the 6 rights of medication administration, encompassing re- assessment of the need for the vaccine , the selection of the correct vaccine and appropriate preparation and administration of the vaccine by a suitable skilled clinician to the correct vaccine recipient on each occasion . Delivery Process es This step involves the vaccine being transferred from one setting to another (e.g. from the pharmacy department to the vaccination clinic ) Dispensing Process When a pharmacist dispenses a vaccine for a specific person. This step includes the process of dispensing the vaccine from a pharmacy undertaken by a pharmacist. Unless the vaccine has been dispensed for a specific COVID -19 vaccine recipient from the pharmacy department, the 'Dispensing Processes' tier two incident type will not be applicable for COVID -19 vaccines. Post -administration Patient Monitoring This process step encompasses a suitable skilled clinician to assess the vaccine recipient and the effect that the vaccine is having post administration . Preparation/Formulation Processes This process step involves choosing the correct vaccine for administration. Preparation process is when the vaccine cannot be administered in its original form. It usually involves dilution of the product so that it can be administered parenterally . Sometimes different dilutions are required for a specific vaccine , and it is important that the correct dilution is followed for the preparation of the vaccine . Prescribing Process es When a doctor or nurse practitioner prescribes a vaccine for a patient. Most COVID -19 vaccines will be administered under the Structured Administration and Supply Arrangements (SASA) and will not have an associated prescription for each dose. Therefore, the tier two categor y of Prescribing Processes will usually not be relevant for clinical incidents related to COVID -19 vaccines. Procurement/Supplier Processes This step involves the distribution of vaccine to the ward or unit. In the case of COVID vaccination incidents this would relate more to supply of the vaccines from the manufacturer and/or Commonwealth to the State and then to each hospital ; with Delivery Processes relating to the (daily) movement of vaccine stocks from hospital pharmacy departments to clinics . Storage Process (in pharmacy or on unit) This process relates to the storage of the vaccine and encompasses any special storage conditions (e.g. cold chain management) related to stability of the vaccine. Table 2 - Descriptions for tier three incident types Tier two incident type Tier three incident type Description Administration to Patient Contraindication due to history of allergy A vaccine is administered to a vaccine recipient who has a known allergy to the vaccine or excipient of the vaccine (i.e. polyethylene glycol [PEG] or Polysorbate) Contraindication due to interactions with other medication s A vaccine is administered that is contraindicated due to an interaction with another medication/vaccine (e. g. not spacing vaccines apart sufficiently as per recommendations) Contraindication due to medical condition A vaccine is administered that is contraindicated due to a medical complication/factor which may increase the chance of toxicity and/or side- effects . This can include cases where a COVID -19 vaccine is administered to a patient outside of the approved age range for the vaccine according to the Product Information or Standard Operating Procedures Version 1.0 | April 2021 6 Tier two incident type Tier three incident type Description Expired medication/fluid The vaccine administered had passed its expiry date. This can be the original expiry date provided by the drug company or for sterile preparations that have short ened expiri es due to dilution or at different temperature exposures . It is im portant to include the reason the vaccine has expired if it is related to delivery/storage of the vaccine Incorrect dose The vaccine recipient was administered the incorrect dose of the vaccine Incorrect timing of dose (premature ) The vaccine recipient received a second dose that was too soon after the first dose was administered (according to the Standard Operating Procedures or Product Information) Incorrect medication/fluid The vaccine recipient was administered an incorrect vaccine, medication or incorrect fluid replacement Incorrect patient The vaccine recipient was administered medications that were prescribed for another patient Incorrect route of administration The vaccination was administered via the incorrect route. For example, a vaccine might incorrectly be administered subcutaneously rather than intramuscularly Delivery Process es Damaged/contaminated during delivery A vaccine was damaged/contaminated during the delivery process Delayed delivery to unit/ward Vaccine delivery was delayed to appropriate unit/ clinic Delivered to wrong destination Vaccine was delivered to the wrong unit/ clinic Post - administration Patient Monitoring Failure to activate rapid response/resuscitation team Failure to escalate care in response to vaccination management Failure/insufficient response to significant change in patient status Failure or insufficient response to a change in vaccine recipient status which would affect management of the vaccine recipient Failure/insufficient/incomplete monitoring Monitoring for vaccine therapy was either insufficient or not undertaken Incorrect/insufficient triage in emergency situations Involves i ncorrect/insufficient assessment and triaging of the vaccine recipient . Incident types involve inadequate assessment, escalation and management of vaccine recipien t's requirements Unplanned elevation of care to intensive care setting When patient deterioration results in transfer to intensive care setting (e.g. ICU) due to insufficient/inadequate monitoring of the vaccine recipient post-administration of the vaccine Unplanned transfer of care to other institution or clinical service When vaccine recipient deterioration results in referral/transfer to specialised care due to insufficient/inadequate monitoring of the vaccine recipient post-administration of vaccine Preparation/ Formulation Processes Expired constituents Date of administration has surpassed the expiry date provided on the label of the container of the vaccine and has been administered to the patient Incorrect preparation/formulation (dose/concentration) When preparing a vaccine for administration, the incorrect vaccine , dose, or diluent is chosen prior to administration of the vaccine Medication delayed The administration of the vaccine was delayed due to difficulties during the preparation process Omitted Ingredient The diluent was omitted in the preparation unintentionally when preparing the vaccine for administration Use of damaged/contaminated ingredients Vaccine integrity has been damaged or contaminated such that it is not suitable for administration, but has been administered to the vaccine recipient (i.e. coring of the bung has resulted in bung particles in the vaccine) Version 1.0 | April 2021 7 Tier two incident type Tier three incident type Description Procurement/ Supplier Process es Damaged/contaminated product Vaccine integrity has been damaged or contaminated such that it is not suitable for administration Expired product Date of administration has surpassed the expiry date provided on the label of the container of the vaccine but has not been administered to the vaccine recipient Storage Process es (in pharmacy or on unit) Damaged/contaminated product Vaccine integrity has been damaged or contaminated such that it is not suitable for administration Expired product Date of administration has surpassed the expiry date provided on the label of the container of the vaccine but has not been administered to the vaccine recipient Incorrect storage environment Vaccine has not been stored appropriat ely as per requirements. For example, a medication requiring protection from light is stored outside of packaging resulting in the product degrading and being ineffective Non-secure storage of controlled substances Schedule 4 vaccine has not been stored in correct safe location according to Medicines and Poisons Regulations 2016 and hospital policy Refrigeration failure Medication requiring refrigeration has not been stored in the refrigerator or cold chain has been breached (refrigerator temper ature has not been maintained within required range) "}
