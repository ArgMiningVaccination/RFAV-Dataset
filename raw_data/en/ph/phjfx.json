Who or what inspired you to meditate? I had always been intrigued by the idea of meditation as far back as I can remember. I was always fascinated with martial arts, Tibetan and Shaolin monks, and Buddhism. Meditation is a major component within these traditions. I would see meditation in movies as a means of obtaining information, or journeying to other worlds to converse with different beings or loved ones. Through learning and practicing different techniques with different teachers from indigenous, Hindu, and Buddhist traditions, I came to learn the true power of meditation. I learned that we can in fact alter our state of mind, travel to different dimensions, and obtain insight and clarity, amongst many other things. I learned that we can heal ourselves, grow, change, and learn just by having a consistent meditation practice. I was inspired to meditate as a means to better myself as a person and evolve my mind to higher schools of thought. What's a valuable lesson or insight you uncovered during your meditation journey? I learned that we can actually go beyond the mind and beyond words and still exist. I learned that information doesn't only come through our five senses. I learned that we are capable of more as human beings than simply working, providing, and paying taxes. I learned what my purpose was, and who I AM. One of the most valuable lessons I have learned through meditation is that we are all actually connected when we move beyond what separates us as individuals. When we move our awareness beyond the body, beyond the mind and beyond the emotions, there we are one giant conscious awareness that connects us all. I also uncovered that when we can experience this oneness, inner peace and happiness is not far behind. A major insight I received through meditation, was that I had to share this with as many people as I could. What's your favorite meditation technique and why? My favorite technique is focusing my gaze and awareness at my third eye chakra. The third eye chakra is connected to vision, imagination and intuition. When you focus your gaze there, you are strengthening your ability to receive intuitive insight while increasing your power to imagine or \"image-in\" what your heart desires. I often use my voice to tone and hum while meditating because it increases the vibration in my body. I also love to have binaural beats, Shamanic drumming or classical music playing in the background. Follow Joshua on Social or Visit "}
