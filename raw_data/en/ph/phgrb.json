Working with us is easy: - Set up your QLMC account on PPMS (core facility management software). Please refer to our [PPMS Quick Start](/research/core-facilities/quantitative-light-microscopy/assets/qlmc-quickstart.pdf)(PDF) for \"How to\" [Register New PPMS Account](https://ppms.us/utsw/areq/?pf=2) - Complete the required microscope/software training. Training is required for booking and autonomous use. Not sure which microscope to use, just [marcel.mettlen@utsouthwestern.edu](mailto:no-reply@utsouthwestern.edu)us. [Submit Training Request](https://ppms.us/utsw/req/?all=true&pf=2) - Book a microscope or service. Sign up for the required time - pay attention to our [cancellation and data management policies](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/research/core-facilities/quantitative-light-microscopy/policies/). [Make a microscope reservation](https://ppms.us/utsw/listsys/?pf=2) - Keep us informed of & acknowledge QLMC in publications. For funding purposes, acknowledgements are REALLY important to us! Please let us know when you publish. [Acknowledgements](/research/core-facilities/quantitative-light-microscopy/policies/) Core Director Associate Prof. "}
