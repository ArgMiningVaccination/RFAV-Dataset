As energetic beings, we each omit vibrations and frequencies of varying intensity and quality depending on whether we are angry, experiencing grief or are unwell. Dis-ease in this system is where all illness (unless as a result of an accident) originates. This is not a chaotic system that randomly fires out a mess of frequencies, but a deeply intelligent and ordered force that creates symptoms in its attempts to heal. As a holistic practitioner I understand that healing is a whole person experience that requires an understanding of the whole person - physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. I want to know the history of your condition, how it presently manifests and what its purpose is? My daughter's eczema was not about gluten, the wrong washing powder or bad luck, it had a clear purpose. It was a dynamic expression of the imbalance and negative energy embedded in her vital system. Her eczema was not her disease but a representation of it with its own unique intrinsic energetic picture. By matching this frequency with a homeopathic stimulus of similar energy, her powerful self-healing mechanism engaged. Homeopathic medicines have an impact on every organ, cell and system in the body. As I had experienced myself all those years ago, once the root of her condition was addressed there was no longer any purpose in her vital system manifesting skin symptoms, some eleven years on she has not experienced eczema again. I draw on Chinese Meridian mapping, the Chakra System, Aryuvedic medicine, anthroposophy and the nuts and bolts of human chemistry, physiology and anatomy in order to understand the \"whole person\" in front of me. Eating well is fundamental to good health and happiness and an important aspect of my practice. I provide simple nutritional recommendations that are achievable, effective and synchronised with the homeopathic treatment that you receive. Where necessary I will recommend orthomolecular supplementation to enhance your healing. The constitutional, organ supportive and detoxing medicines I prescribe focussed on the rapid, gentle and permanent restoration of your health. "}
