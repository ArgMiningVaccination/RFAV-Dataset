[The Duty of Medical Practitioners and CAM/TCM Practitioners to Inform Competent Adult Patients about Alternatives by Xiju Zhao, 2013](https://login.ccmain.ohionet.org/login?url=http://link.springer.com/openurl?genre=book&isbn=978-3-642-31646-3) The book pays interest to a small and almost untouched topic: a health practitioner' s duty to inform about alternatives. It covers both orthodox medicine practitioners and CAM practitioners. The topic is explored in a co mparative way, examining the laws of not only common law jurisdictions, such as the USA, England, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, but also two East Asia jurisdictions ( China and Japan ) . It uses the collective wisdom of several common law jurisdictions, but also differentiates them. It places the issue of \"disclosure of alternatives\" in a clear and wider context, making a cogent distinction between diagnosis/treatment and information disclosure.
