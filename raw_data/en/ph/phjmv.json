Department of Psychiatry Psychiatric case formulation and treatment (PGY III; 2009 -2013 ) In 2009 I developed a year -long seminar series for third -year psychiatry residents.

Why is this person developing symptoms now or w hy is this person presenting for treatment now (precipitating factors)? Why is this person still ill (perpetuating factors)? And, why is this person not more ill (protective factors)? The reason for organizing the lectures in this way was to help residents to organize the information thematically, and to provide a structure by which to organize their case -formulations. The psychiatri c interview (PGY I; 2008 -2012 ) I developed a nine -month seminar series for first -year psychiatry residents to provide an in troduction to the principles of psychiatric interviewing.
