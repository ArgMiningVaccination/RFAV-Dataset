As COVID-19 vaccination rates stall and disparities broaden by race and ethnicity, creative partnerships are increasingly important to dispel vaccination myths and promote health equity. Faced with a similar crisis of confidence in the novel cow-pox vaccine in the early 19th century, Reverend Rowland Hill befriended Edward Jenner and became an ardent cow-pox vaccination advocate and public health practitioner. Hill sought to (1) educate diverse English communities on the benefits of proper vaccination, (2) engage clergy as influential community-based vaccination advocates and providers, and (3) increase vaccination equity. Importantly, his efforts contributed to the decline of smallpox in 19th century England. Today, his example should continue to instruct public health practitioners and community leaders. This paper will describe how vaccination advocates can learn from Hill's context and example to defend COVID-19 vaccines against anti-vaccination rhetoric, engage community leaders as advocates, and increase vaccination access. Ultimately, Hill's success in propagating a novel cow-pox vaccination throughout pre-Victorian England is an encouragement that coordinated campaigns can overcome hesitancy, engage community leaders, and promote vaccine equity.
