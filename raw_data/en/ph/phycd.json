We answer your questions.", "sitename": null, "date": "2018-01-15", "cleaned_text": "Unlike other healing arts, reiki is passed from master to student through a reiki attunement that allows the student to connect to the universal reiki source. The attunement allows you to become a vessel of reiki, and move reiki energy for yourself and others. While you can read about reiki in a book and learn hand positions, until you have been attuned to channel reiki, you cannot truly practice reiki. What is Involved for Each Reiki Attunement? In a reiki level 1 attunement, students are attuned to three different symbols, each representing a different aspect of reiki energy: power, mental/emotional balance and distance healing. Each student receives attunements to these 3 symbols four separate times, and with each repetition the connection deepens. The attunements for reiki level 2 and [reiki master](https://www.centreofexcellence.com/shop/reiki-master-teacher-diploma-course/) are similar in nature, but involve different symbols, each with a different significance to opening your energetic pathways. What Does It Feel Like to Get an Attunement? Receiving a reiki attunement is a powerful spiritual experience, as your energetic pathways are opened by a reiki master. This energetic opening allows the reiki energy to flow freely through your body to impact your health and the health of others. The feeling of a reiki attunement is a personal one, but students often report that they feel a lightening of their body and tingling from their head to their toes as the reiki energy pathways are opened. The opening of an attunement has the effect of enhancing other energetic healing and channelling pathways, and students report that receiving an attunement causes increased [intuitive awareness](https://www.centreofexcellence.com/shop/intuitive-healing-diploma-course/), and enhances any innate psychic sensitivity. How Do You Prepare for an Attunement? How you prepare for a reiki attunement depends on your own personal spiritual practice. Opening an energetic pathway is no light matter, and while it's not strictly necessary to do anything in order to prepare to receive a reiki attunement, most students choose to reconnect with their own spiritual practice before their attunement, to heighten the overall effects of the attunement and maximise its transformative power. One recommended plan for preparing for a reiki attunement involves a 3-day cleanse before your attunement. Avoid eating heavy foods, limit or eliminate caffeine, sugar, tobacco or alcohol. Spend your time reading or meditating rather than watching TV. Make a conscious effort to release negative emotions, such as anger or jealousy. All of these preparations will help you be more ready to accept the spiritual transformation and encourage the attunement to have profound, long-term impacts on your life and wellbeing. Does an Attunement Need to be Renewed? Once you have been attuned to reiki, the reiki energy will flow through you for the rest of your life. Your [ability to channel](https://www.centreofexcellence.com/shop/channelling-diploma-course/) and move reiki energy remains with you, as the gift of reiki follows you and helps you for the rest of your life. What Are the Benefits of Receiving Attunements Remotely? In-person classes are often taught quickly, without much time for students to incorporate the information. The attunements are given en masse at the end of the class, without time for the students to prepare for the profound spiritual transformation that an attunement entails. By [studying remotely](https://www.centreofexcellence.com/shop/reiki-1-2-diploma-course/), you are able to learn and incorporate the benefits of reiki at your own pace, and take a few days to prepare yourself for your attunement before you receive it. Reiki is an energetic practice, and much of the reiki you receive and deliver throughout the rest of your life will be at a distance. Beginning your reiki journey remotely helps you prepare for a life of reiki without borders.
