Bloom, David Canning & Mark Weston Introduction \"You let a doctor take a dainty, helpless baby, and put that stuff from a cow, which has been scratched and had dirt rubbed into her wound, into that child.Even, the Jennerians now admit that infant vaccination spreads disease amongchildren. More mites die from vaccination than from the disease they are sup-posed to be inoculated against.\" (George Bernard Shaw, 1929) The world has come a long way since George Bernard Shaw fulminated against vaccination in the 1920s. Vaccines are now widely regarded as aneffective and cheap tool for improving health. Children in all countries areroutinely immunized against major diseases, and the practice has becomea central plank of global public health efforts. Despite these advances, however, immunization coverage remains far from universal, and the developing world in particular remains vulnerableto vaccine-preventable illnesses. For example, global coverage for DTP\u2014the vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (whooping cough)\u2014hadreached 70 per cent in the 1990s, but in sub-Saharan Africa it stood at just53 per cent. In Somalia, Nigeria, and Congo, moreover, coverage halvedbetween 1990 and 2000. 1Vaccination against measles also falls short; the WORLD ECONOMICS Vol. 6 No. 3 July-September 2005 15David E.

Bloom, David Canning & Mark Weston disease caused 660,000 deaths in 2002.2In all, 3 million people die each year from vaccine-preventable diseases.3 In the developed world, too, vaccination efforts face obstacles. The rise of a well-organized anti-vaccine movement has persuaded some parentsnot to immunize their children. Vaccines, the campaigners claim, causemore harm than good: in societies where vaccine-preventable diseaseprevalence is minimal (ironically as a result of past immunization efforts,although this is rarely acknowledged by campaigners), the side effects ofvaccines pose a greater health threat than the diseases themselves. Why,they ask, should everyone be vaccinated in order to protect the relativelysmall number of people that might contract the disease in the absence ofmass immunization? It is not just populist activists who overlook the positive effects of vac- cination. More scientific estimates of the effects of vaccines also tend tounderplay the benefits, disregarding the broad economic impacts ofimmunization in favor of a predominant and narrow focus on the avertedcosts of medical treatment and health care. With other human capitalinvestments, such as education, economic analysis of the impacts focuseson the effect on earnings. This has not occurred, however, with vaccina-tion, and until recently it did not occur for health in general. Public healthspecialists generally perceive vaccination as a hugely beneficial invest-ment as it is both cheap and very effective at a population level (the influ-ential 1993 World Development Report, \"Investing in Health\", listed theWorld Health Organization's Expanded Program on Immunization as thefirst component of \"the essential public health package\" 4). Because of the narrow view of its impacts taken by the rest of the policy-making commu-nity, however, policy emphasis on vaccination is weaker than it might beif the full range of benefits were taken into account. Health economists have long used two well-established tools to evalu- ate health interventions in economic terms. Both types of analysis are 2World Health Organization (2004): \"Measles Deaths Drop Dramatically as Vaccine Reaches World's Poorest Children\", WHO/UNICEF Joint Press Release, 27 April. 3Center for Global Development (2005): \"Making Markets for Vaccines: From to DC. 4World Bank (1993): \"Investing in Health\", World Development Report 1993, World Bank, Washington DC: 106. A survey of health professionals in New Zealand, moreover, found that 94% supported vaccinations, with86% of those with children reporting having had them immunized (Tim Jelleyman and Andrew Ure (2004):\"Attitudes to immunization: a survey of health professionals in the Rotorua District\", Journal of the New Zealand Medical Association , 20 February, Vol 117 No 1189).WORLD ECONOMICS Vol. 6 No. 3 July-September 2005 17The Value of Vaccination widely used and appropriately respected. Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) seeks to determine the cost of an intervention (e.g. vaccination) inrelationship to a particular outcome. How much does it cost to save a cer-tain number of lives, or to avert a certain number of illnesses, for example?Averted medical costs (at least those that would be incurred in the shortrun in the absence of vaccination) are also typically taken into account.Cost-benefit analysis (CBA), by contrast, makes a direct comparisonbetween costs and benefits by monetizing the value of the latter. Thistechnique facilitates the comparison of two or more interventions, partic-ularly when there is a range of discrete outcomes. There are several problems with both types of analysis, as they have been used to date. First, neither type typically takes account of the cost ofaverted infections that may occur years later. This is understandable, sincesuch infections are hard to predict, but that does not make future cost sav-ings any less important. Second, both types of analysis take a narrow view of the benefits of vac- cination that fails to take account of recent academic work on the effectsof health on incomes. The experience of development over the past half-century shows that good health fuels economic growth, just as bad healthstrangles it. Healthy children perform better at school, and healthy adultsare both more productive at work and better able to tend to the health andeducation of their children. Healthy families are also more likely to savefor the future; since they tend to have fewer children, resources spent onthem go further, thereby improving their life prospects. Finally, healthiersocieties may be a stronger magnet for foreign direct investment andtourism than those where disease poses a constant threat. Third, neither type of analysis factors in the effects that improved health has on triggering lower fertility rates. The combination of loweredmortality rates and subsequently lowered fertility rates leads to a \"babyboom\" generation that, when it reaches working age, can help bring abouta significant economic boom (as happened in East Asia). In the case of vac-cination, the consequent boost to health can catalyze a change in the agestructure of the population (via the lowered fertility rates) that can lead tosignificant economic benefits. Our research looks at all CEA and CBA studies listed in Pub. Med. for 2004 and 2005. The wide range of published results emphasizes the diffi-culties inherent in such work. However, since all of these studies fail to18 WORLD ECONOMICS Vol. 6 No. 3 July-September 2005 David E. Bloom, David Canning & Mark Weston address the broader considerations described in the preceding two para- graphs, they all either overstate the cost of achieving a given beneficialoutcome or underestimate the net benefits. It is this insight that spurs thecurrent work. With the spread of immunization having stalled in many parts of the world, a wider look at its benefits is timely. In this paper, we discuss thevalue of vaccination from a broad perspective. As well as the health bene-fits, we examine the cost of vaccine programs and their economic impacts.Vaccination has proved a cost-effective and remarkably efficient way ofimproving health, and has saved millions of lives. It has the potential,however, to be more effective still, and renewed efforts are needed if themomentum is to be regained. Part 1 of the paper provides a brief summary of the history of vaccina- tion and its impacts on human health. Part 2 looks at the state of play todayand at the reasons why progress on vaccine delivery and development hasslowed. Part 3 considers research-to-date and presents new research on theeconomic benefits of immunization. It begins with a review of both cost-effectiveness analysis and cost-benefit analysis, which indicates that abroader view of the long-term benefits of vaccination makes immunizationprograms much more worthwhile, in terms of their economic consequences,than has been thought in the past. It broadens the analysis by reviewingrecent research showing the relationship between health and wealth (Part3.2), estimating the rates of return to one of GAVI's prospective invest-ments (Part 3.3), and presenting a study on immunization and cognitivedevelopment, which has been linked to higher earnings (also Part 3.3). 1. A glorious past The theory behind vaccination was brought to the West from Asia. TheChinese had observed that certain illnesses could only be contracted once,so they experimented with giving healthy individuals doses of diseasessuch as smallpox that would be too small to make them ill but largeenough to stimulate immunity. The process was known as variolation and,in the case of smallpox, usually involved injecting powder from smallpoxscabs into the vein. Although some individuals fell ill or died during theprocess, smallpox rates among communities that had been variolated weresignificantly lower than elsewhere.WORLD ECONOMICS Vol. 6 No. 3 July-September 2005 19The Value of Vaccination Variolation was introduced to Britain in the early 18th century by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who had observed the process in T urkey, whereher husband was British ambassador. Several decades later, EdwardJenner, who had undergone variolation as a child, noticed that people whocontracted cowpox after working with cows became immune to smallpox.T o test this observation, he injected a small child with cowpox. The childfell ill with cowpox but, when later injected with smallpox, did not con-tract the latter disease. Jenner published his findings in 1798, and namedthe process \"vaccination\", from the Latin word for cowpox. 5 In 1890, Emil von Behring and Shibasaburo Kitasato gave substance to Jenner's observation when they discovered antibodies. Injecting a smallamount of a disease organism into an uninfected individual, they found,stimulated the production of antibodies, which fought off the initial attackand thereby prepared the body to fend off infection later in life. At aroundthis time, vaccines for rabies, cholera, typhoid, and the plague were devel-oped, although it was not until after the World War II that vaccines becamea widespread tool for improving health. T oday, 26 diseases are vaccine-preventable. Since World War II, vaccination has had a major impact on global health, as the following list of successes shows: Smallpox, which had killed two million people per year until the late 1960s, was wiped out by 1979 after a massive worldwide immunizationcampaign. The number of polio cases fell from over 300,000 per year in the 1980s to just 2,000 in 2002. 6 T wo-thirds of developing countries have eradicated neonatal tetanus.7 Since the launch of the World Health Organization's Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) in 1974, the number of reported measles deathshas dropped from 6 million to less than 1 million per year. Whooping cough cases have fallen from 3 million per year to less than a quarter of a million. Diphtheria cases have declined from 80,000 in 1975 to less than 10,000 today. 8 5The Hutchinson Encyclopaedia (1999): Helicon, Oxford. 6The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization website. www.vaccinealliance.org 7WHO (2002) op cit. 8Birmingham, M., Stein C (2003): \"The Burden of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases\", in Barry R.

Bloom, David Canning & Mark Weston The haemophilus influenzae B (Hib) vaccine has reduced the incidence of Hib meningitis in Europe by 90 per cent in ten years.9 The EPI includes six vaccines, covering diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, measles, polio, and tuberculosis. Before 1974, only 5 per cent ofchildren were vaccinated against these diseases. T oday over 70 per centare vaccinated. 10The program has reduced the share of the six diseases it tackles in the total burden of disease in young children from 23 per centto less than 10 per cent since the mid-1970s. 11It has been estimated that declines in diphtheria, measles, and whooping cough have averted wellover a million deaths in developing countries. 12 In 2000, in an effort to maintain the EPI momentum, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) was launched. GAVI com-prises United Nations agencies, governments, donors, foundations, privatecompanies, and academic institutions. It has six core strategic objectives: 13 Improve access to sustainable immunization services Expand the use of all existing safe and cost-effective vaccines, and promote delivery of other appropriate interventions at immunizationcontacts Support the national and international accelerated disease control tar- gets for vaccine-preventable diseases Accelerate the development and introduction of new vaccines and technologies Accelerate research and development efforts for vaccines needed pri- marily in developing countries Make immunization coverage a centerpiece in international develop- ment efforts. As we will see in part 2 of the paper, such an initiative is urgently needed. 9Jenifer Ehreth (2003): \"The 10WHO (2002) op cit. 11World Bank (2001): Immunization at a glance. World Bank, November.

A difficult present 2.1 Lost momentum The rapid progress towards universal vaccination coverage in the 1970s and 1980s has slowed in recent years. Declining funding for immunization has been mirrored in stagnating or falling coverage. UNICEF funding for vaccination fell from $182 millionto $51.4 million between 1990 and 1998. 14Global coverage of the diph- theria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP3) vaccine has been stalled at around74 per cent since 1990. 15Fifty-seven developing countries have yet to elimi- nate neonatal tetanus, and 200,000 babies died of the disease in 2000.16 Yellow fever has made a comeback, despite the availability of an effectivevaccine; the number of outbreaks increased sharply after governmentscurtailed programs in the belief they had vanquished the disease. 17 Developing countries lag behind the West in terms of vaccination cov- erage. Measles immunization rates are over 90 per cent in Europe butbelow 70 per cent in South Asia and below 60 per cent in sub-SaharanAfrica (see Figure 1). 18T en developing countries reported cases of polio in June 2005, despite the massive (and largely successful) global effort toeradicate the virus. 19Sixty-two per cent of countries, meanwhile, had still not achieved full routine immunization coverage in 2003, with GAVI esti-mating that at least 9.2 million additional infants need to be reached toachieve full coverage. 20 There are several factors behind this loss of momentum. First, although dramatic progress has been made in increasing worldwide vaccination cov-erage from below 5 per cent to above 70 per cent, the task has inevitablybecome harder now that the easiest-to-reach populations have been vacci-nated. Many of those whom campaigns have not yet reached are either liv-ing in inaccessible areas, out of range of clinics and health services, orreluctant to be vaccinated or to vaccinate their children. Because these 14Gauri, Varun & Khaleghian, Peyvand \"Immunization in Developing Countries: Political and Development, Elsevier, vol. 30(12), pages 2109-32. 15GAVI (2003): \"Progress towards immunization goals 2001: Summary presentation February. 16WHO (2002) op cit. 17GAVI (2001): \"World Development Indicators 2004\", World Bank, Washington DC. 19World Health Organization: Polio Eradication Website, Global Case Count.

Bloom, David Canning & Mark Weston communities are more elusive, the average cost per vaccination has increased, and it may be that other apparently cheaper health interven-tions have become more attractive. Second, there are many practical problems impeding vaccine delivery. Delivering vaccines to patients requires functioning freezers and refriger-ators (which in turn require a constant supply of energy); good roads andreliable transport to move the vaccines from port to clinic; clinics withaccess to people who need to be immunized; parents who know the valueof vaccination; trained medical staff to deliver the dose; and sterilesyringes. Many of the poor countries where vaccine coverage has stalled lack all or part of this infrastructure. In Burkina Faso and Niger for example,23 per cent of refrigerators used for storing vaccines were found to be non-functioning. 21Only 16 per cent of vaccine-importing countries could guarantee vaccine safety and quality,22while a further study of 19 devel- oping countries found that at least half of injections were unsafe.23 21GAVI (2003) op cit. 22WHO (2002) op cit. 23Ibid. % of children (12-23 months) immunizedFigure 1: Disparities in immunization rates Source: World Bank, Washington DC (2004). Data are for 2002.020406080100Sub-Saharan Africa South AsiaEurope and Central Asia Measles DPTWORLD ECONOMICS Vol. 6 No. 3 July-September 2005 23The Value of Vaccination The third factor behind the lack of progress in recent years is political. Political disruptions have affected coverage in some areas. In Somalia andCongo, for example, where vaccination rates have fallen rapidly in the pastdecade, war and social breakdown have impeded public health campaigns,despite \"vaccination days\" in Congo that temporarily halted fighting.Gauri et al. have found that the quality of institutions and governance are positively correlated with vaccination coverage. 24Immunization cam- paigns do not operate in isolation\u2014they are dependent on the prevailingpolitical and social environment. As that environment is altered, immu-nization may be interrupted. Politics in the developed world have also played a part. According to a report by the US Institute of Medicine, in 1982 the US vaccine industrywas forced to stop offering low-price vaccines to developing countries fol-lowing congressional hearings that \"savaged\" the industry for \"allegedlysubsidizing vaccines for the poor children of the world by charging highcosts to US families and taxpayers\". 25As the Institute of Medicine points out, this move was based on a flawed premise, as the US vaccines wouldhave been developed anyway to protect American children and travelers. The fourth reason for the lost momentum relates to public perceptions of vaccination. As coverage spreads through a community, it reaches apoint at which those who are unvaccinated are highly unlikely to catch adisease because herd immunity has set in. At this juncture, it may be morerational for an individual to refuse vaccination in order to avoid any risk ofside effects. With the oral polio vaccine, for example, there is a one in amillion chance of paralysis, and in societies where mass vaccination haseliminated the disease, the risk of paralysis is greater than that of catchingpolio itself. What had once been a public and private good is now a publicgood but a private risk. As more and more people choose to avoid this risk,of course, overall coverage rates decline, and the community is once againexposed to the threat of the disease. Public perceptions have been influenced by vaccine scares. Controversy and the attendant bad publicity about the safety of vaccineshas been abetted by incidents such as the withdrawal of half the US sup-ply of flu vaccines in 2004 due to contamination at the manufacturer, 24Gauri et al. (2002) op cit. 25Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences (1997): America's Vital Interest in Global Health . National Academy Press, Washington.24 WORLD ECONOMICS Vol. 6 No. 3 July-September 2005 David E. Bloom, David Canning & Mark Weston Chiron's UK plant26, and by the swine flu vaccine, which led to deaths of some of those immunized (while the flu itself did not arrive). In addition, alarms over the safety of vaccines such as that for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), which some believe to cause autism, havefurther fanned the anti-vaccine movement's flames. In the US, disputescontinue to rage about the scientific basis of such claims, but the prepon-derance of the evidence, according to the US Centers for Disease Control(CDC), says that the MMR vaccine is safe. 27In the UK, physician Andrew Wakefield caused alarm over the MMR vaccine for the same reason. Ratesof MMR coverage dropped in Britain and elsewhere in the wake of thisscare, before Wakefield's case was to a large extent discredited and thejournal that had published his research, The Lancet , partially retracted the study. A survey of public reactions to Wakefield's findings showed that 53 per cent of people believed that, because media coverage gave roughly equalspace to support and rejection of the autism theory, the scientific evidencebase must be similarly balanced. 28Only 25 per cent, moreover, were aware that no link between MMR and autism had been found in the over-whelming majority of studies. 29A similar scare occurred over the hepatitis B vaccine, which in the mid-1990s was briefly believed to cause multiplesclerosis in some who received it. Subsequent cohort and case-controlstudies found no link between the two. 30 Vaccine scares do not always lack foundation. The Rotashield vaccine for rotavirus, which was approved in the US in 1998, was withdrawn a yearlater after reports were received of acute intussusception (a potentiallyserious bowel condition) occurring shortly after delivery of the vaccine. Astudy later confirmed this relationship\u2014between 1 in 5,000 and 1 in 26Los Angeles Times (2005): \"Vaccine Delays Hit Chiron's Recovery\", LA Times , Los Angeles, 16 July. 27Concerns are summarized in Robert Kennedy Junior (2005): \"Autism, Mercury and Politics\", Boston Globe , Boston MA, 1 July. In July 2005, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) affirmed, inresponse to such stories, that, \"the science states very clearly that vaccines save lives and protect our children.\"(New York Times (2005): \"No Vaccine-Autism Link, Parents Are T old\", New York Times, 20 July). Athttp://www.cdc.gov/nip/vacsafe/concerns/autism/default.htm, the CDC details the evidence concerning theabsence of a connection between the MMR vaccine and autism and critiques the studies that show a link. 28Hargreaves, Ian, Justin Lewis and T ammy Speers (2003): Towards a better map: Science, the public, and the media , Economic And Social Research Council. 29Lewis, J. & .

They also increase pressure on governments totighten regulation of vaccines, thereby making their production even morecostly. 32 In response to these types of controversies in the US, the Institute of Medicine has called for independent oversight of vaccine safety studies toensure the fairness and openness of the Vaccine Safety Datalink program,which is overseen by the CDC. 33 2.2 Imperiled innovation Like vaccine coverage, development of new vaccines has also stalled in recent years. The number of major western pharmaceutical companiesmaking vaccines fell from 26 in 1967 to 5 today, although some of the slackhas been taken up by developing-country manufacturers. 34As profit mar- gins for rich-world vaccines have outpaced those for vaccines needed bypoor countries, drug developers have concentrated ever more on diseasesof the developed world. The profitability deficit for developing-world vaccines is huge. The developing-world vaccine market is estimated at just 10-15 per cent of theworld total and less than 0.2 per cent of the entire global pharmaceuticalmarket. 35The total volume of all vaccine doses acquired by UNICEF and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) for distribution in thedeveloping world, moreover, is 100 times greater than the number of dosesof Prevnar (a vaccine for diseases caused by streptococcus pneumoniae)delivered in the US, but brings in less than half the revenue. Rich and poor countries have different immunization needs. Parents in rich and poor countries alike are concerned with the safety of vaccinedelivery; but governments in poor countries are concerned with its cost, 31Mulholland, Edward Kim & Bjorvatn, Bjarne (2003): \"Introduction of New Vaccines in the Healthcare System\" in Bloom, Barry (eds) (2003) op cit: 401. 32A notable sidelight to this story is that GlaxoSmithKline has now developed Rotarix, a new rotavirus vaccine (which does not appear to have intussusception as a side effect), which has already been introduced in Mexicoand will soon be introduced in other developing countries. See Technology Review , June 2005, available at http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/05/06/tri/tri_vaccine.asp?p=1. (2001): steps for the vaccine industry\", New York Times , 25 July.26 WORLD ECONOMICS Vol. 6 No. 3 July-September 2005 David E. Bloom, David Canning & Mark Weston too. Products have therefore begun to diverge, even when they tackle the same illness, and the new vaccines that respond to developed-worlddemands are often too expensive for poor countries. In the 1990s, forexample, developed countries began to use the DT aP instead of DT wPvaccine. DT aP (which incorporates an acellular pertussis vaccine) is moreexpensive and no more effective than DT wP (which contains a whole-cellpertussis vaccine), but it has fewer side effects and has therefore provedmore popular with developed-world consumers. Similarly, the oral poliovaccine has been replaced in countries such as the US by inactivated poliovaccine (IPV), which is delivered by injection. Unlike OPV , the IPV vac-cine cannot cause paralysis. 36 Pharmaceutical companies have found it difficult to persuade share- holders of the value of continuing to develop vaccines for poor countries.The pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, for example, reported in2001 that it was planning to allocate its freeze-drying capacity to thehaemophilus influenzae B (Hib) vaccine rather than the less profitablemeningitis A/C vaccine. Doses of the DT wP vaccine offered to UNICEF ,moreover, declined from 600 million in 1998 to 150 million two yearslater. 37 Intellectual property rights present a further challenge to vaccine devel- opment. Unlike many other drugs, people generally need only one dose ofa vaccine or vaccine booster. Manufacturers therefore need to gain a returnon their investment from a single use, rather than over a full course oftreatment as in the case of antibiotics, or over a patient's entire lifetime asin the case of antiretroviral drugs for AIDS. Companies are thus particu-larly zealous about protecting vaccine patents\u2014monopoly over productionof a vaccine is, they believe, the best way to profit from it. Generic drugproducers in poor countries, however, threaten these patents and increasethe risk that vaccine developers will not gain a satisfactory return on theirinvestment. Compulsory drug licensing, moreover, which some countrieshave introduced for antiretroviral treatment for AIDS, may deter futureinvestment in drugs for the developing world. If pharmaceutical compa-nies cannot guarantee a return on their research and development coststhrough to the end of the patent period, the attraction of vaccines fordeveloping countries may weaken further. 36Batson et al. (2003) op cit. 37GAVI (2001) op cit.WORLD ECONOMICS Vol. 6 No. 3 July-September 2005 27The Value of Vaccination There is a lively and important debate regarding the costs of drug devel- opment and how they should be assessed. The pharmaceutical industryhas long claimed that the enormous costs of development are only sus-tainable by the prices charged for the subset of drugs that are finallyapproved. Critics have argued that the development costs are overstated,with Relman and Angell 38pointedly stating that \" ... research and devel- opment (R&D) constitutes a relatively small part of the budgets of thelarge drug companies. Their marketing and advertising expenditures aremuch greater than their investment in R&D\". In addition, they argue thatthe pharmaceutical companies are not as innovative as generallyassumed\u2014and that much of the spending on truly new drugs is taxpayer-supported. DiMasi et al. respond to some of the drug industry's critics, 39 carefully critiquing their methodology, and offer new estimates of drug development costs.40(Relman and Angell also critique DiMasi et al.) As Relman and Angell note, not all investment in vaccines comes from the private sector. Government research agencies and academic institu-tions are responsible for much investment in basic scientific research. Awidely promoted means of filling the gap between the needs of develop-ing countries and the demands of pharmaceutical firms' shareholders is forpublic organizations to step in and guarantee a market for vaccines onceprivate companies have developed them. GAVI is currently coordinatingthis effort internationally but, as the downfall of an earlier initiative shows,encouraging diverse organizations to work together to achieve a commongoal is a task riven with complexities. William Muraskin has detailed the demise of the Children's Vaccine Initiative (CVI), which was launched by the World Health Organization in1990 in response to the slowdown in development of new vaccines andpoor distribution of existing ones. 41The CVI's efforts to bring together public and private sector scientists and organizations to work towards solu-tions were unsuccessful. As Muraskin explains, there was a \"great gulf ofdistrust, often bordering on contempt,\" between public and private sectors. 38Relman, A. S., Angell, M.

Bloom, David Canning & Mark Weston Public sector scientists saw their private sector counterparts as being purely driven by profit, while the latter saw the public sector as a wastefuland untrustworthy partner. The WHO closed down the CVI in 1999. Suchexperience reinvigorates the question of government's responsibility forensuring the timely development and production of vaccines\u2014both forold diseases and new. One alternative is that governments themselvescould create greater vaccine development and production capacities.Another option is for governments to offer major financial incentives topharmaceutical corporations in exchange for guaranteed increases indevelopment efforts and actual construction of vaccine production facili-ties. Under this latter scenario, a government could promote competitionamong companies for contracts of this type. The case of avian flu, whichcould soon burst onto the world scene on a terrifying scale, brings thisdiscussion into sharp focus: governments must assess whether they canrely on the private sector to take the initiative in guaranteeing publichealth when the steps needed to make such guarantees currently lookunprofitable. Developing and delivering vaccines, then, are by no means straightfor- ward tasks. The progress in eliminating smallpox and drastically reducingcases of polio shows that, with will and effort, immunization campaignscan be successful, but the momentum for mass immunization has stalledin recent years. In the next section we examine the case for a renewedglobal effort to extend vaccination coverage, focusing on the economicimpacts of vaccine programs. 3. An uncertain future 3.1 The narrow perspective Assessment of the benefits of vaccines has traditionally focused on a spe- cific range of health-related impacts: Cost-effectiveness and cost-benefitanalyses of the numbers of averted illnesses; hospitalizations and deaths;disability-adjusted life years (DAL Ys) gained; and medical costs avoidedare the most common assessment methods. Cost-effectiveness analysislooks at the cost of a health intervention per life saved (or per DAL Ygained, etc.); cost-benefit analysis takes into account the value of each lifesaved or the extra years of healthy life gained, and compares the total valueof those benefits to the cost of the intervention.WORLD ECONOMICS Vol. 6 No. 3 July-September 2005 29The Value of Vaccination The World Health Organization, for example, has estimated that polio eradication will save governments $1.5 billion per year in vaccine, treat-ment, and rehabilitation costs. The elimination of smallpox is thought tohave saved $275 million per year in direct health care costs; 42Barrett esti- mates that the $100 million invested in eradicating the disease in the tenyears after 1967 \"saved the world about $1.35 billion a year\". 43And the US Institute of Medicine reports that for every dollar spent on the MMR vac-cine, $21 is saved. 44 Other cost-effectiveness studies have also found that vaccination cam- paigns lead to substantial savings in medical costs,45but a recent review of 60 studies on the effectiveness, cost, and cost-effectiveness of immuniza-tion programs in developing countries concluded that the literature baseon cost-effectiveness was flimsy. Only three of the studies addressed cost-effectiveness, and most studies were riddled with weaknesses. Few 42GAVI (2003) a: \"The Impact of Immunization on Economic Development\", Press information.

A cost-effectiveness analysis for invasive disease in theelderly in England and Wales\", Eur J Epidemiol , 19(4):365-75.30 WORLD ECONOMICS Vol. 6 No. 3 July-September 2005 David E. Bloom, David Canning & Mark Weston provided confidence intervals for their findings, follow-up was limited, data sources were not clearly defined, and there was little discussion ofconfounding variables. Studies on costs, moreover, found wide variationsdepending on the setting in which a vaccine was being delivered, makingestimates of cost-effectiveness difficult to generalize. 46 The available literature on DAL Ys suggests immunization is a highly cost-effective intervention. The total cost of the EPI vaccine package isless than $1. 47According to GAVI, most vaccination campaigns cost less than $50 per year of healthy life gained. By contrast, treatment for diseasessuch as hypertension in the US costs between $4,340 and $87,940 for eachDAL Y gained. 48Jamison et al. estimated that the EPI vaccine program costs $14-20 per year of healthy life gained in low-income countries.49 Miller and McCann show a similar cost for the Hib vaccine in Africa, andthat Hepatitis B immunization in low-income, high-prevalence countriescosts just $8-11 per DAL Y gained. 50 Although cost-effectiveness provides a robust demonstration of the extent to which vaccines reduce medical costs, it does not take account ofthe wider range of benefits that are covered by cost-benefit analysis. Thelatter also has the advantage of being comparable with investments thattake place outside the health sector. Many cost-benefit analyses of vaccination have shown positive effects. In South Africa, a study of the mass measles immunization campaign of1996 and 1997 found a benefit-cost ratio of 2.27 in the province ofMpumalanga. 51In Japan, the benefit-cost ratio of subsidized influenza vaccinations for the elderly was estimated at 22.9.52Purdy et al. found that most of the costs related to pertussis are due to lost productivity at work 46Pegurri, Elisabetta, Fox-Rushby, Julia A., Damian, Walker (2005): \"The effects and costs of expanding the coverage of immunization services in developing countries: a systematic literature review\", Vaccine , H., Measham, A.

In the study of measles immunization in South Africa, the benefit-costratio in the Western Cape province was 0.89. 54And a study to assess the incorporation of the pneumoccocal 7-valent conjugated vaccine into theroutine immunization program in Spain found a benefit-cost ratio of only0.59. 55 3.2 A wider view Neither cost-effectiveness nor cost-benefit analysis has so far taken full account of the broader economic impacts of immunization. These impactsstem from the fact that immunization protects individuals not only againstgetting an illness per se, but also against the long-term effects of that ill-ness on their physical, emotional, and cognitive development. For exam-ple, by stunting physical growth, childhood diseases can curtailopportunities for carrying out manual labor during adulthood. In develop-ing countries, where manual work is frequently the only option, physicalhandicaps are particularly damaging. Cognitive development may also beaffected by vaccine-preventable disease. Measles, for example, can causebrain damage or impair learning abilities, with severe impacts on a child'slife prospects. The importance of these effects is borne out by recent work demon- strating the link from improved health to economic growth. This researchhas made clear the importance of health interventions for achievinggrowth and suggests that cost-effectiveness analyses, as currently con-ducted, are likely to underestimate the benefits of vaccination. There are several channels through which health improves wealth. The first is through its impact on education. Healthy children are better able toattend school and to learn effectively while in class. Studies have found 53Purdy, K. W., Hay, J. W., Botteman, M. F ., Ward, J. I.

Bloom, David Canning & Mark Weston that health interventions such as de-worming programs and iron supple- mentation reduce absenteeism from school.56Curing whipworm infection, meanwhile, has been found to lead to improved test scores.57 The second channel is through health's impact on productivity. Like schoolchildren, healthier workers have better attendance rates and aremore energetic and mentally robust. Workers in healthy communities,moreover, need to take less time off to care for sick relatives. Body size,which is greatly influenced by one's health during childhood, has beenfound to have large impacts on long-term productivity. 58Bloom et al. have calculated that a one-year increase in life expectancy improves labor pro-ductivity by 4 per cent. 59 The third means by which health improves wealth is through its effect on savings and investment. Healthier people expect to live longer, so theyhave a greater incentive to save for retirement. They are also able to workproductively for longer, giving them more time to save. Workers andentrepreneurs therefore have a larger capital base to draw on for invest-ment, leading to greater job creation and higher incomes. The savingsbooms in the East Asian \"tiger\" economies in the last quarter of the 20thcentury were largely driven by rising life expectancy and greater savingsfor retirement. Finally, health can boost economies via a demographic dividend. The transition from high to low rates of mortality in many developing countrieshas been rapid. Largely brought about by medical and dietary improve-ments, the transition has contributed to falls in fertility as parents realizethey need fewer children to attain their ideal family size. The boom inyoung dependents that occurs when mortality falls is therefore followedby a decline in fertility. At this stage, parents can concentrate their 56Miguel, Edward, and Kremer, Michael (2004): \"Worms: Identifying Impacts on Education and Health T reatment Externalities\", Econometrica , 72(1), 159-217; P .

WORLD ECONOMICS Vol. 6 No. 3 July-September 2005 33The Value of Vaccination resources in nurturing fewer children, thus increasing the children's prospects of receiving a good education and effective health care. As theboom generation reaches working age, and provided it encounters a policyenvironment that is favorable to job creation, it can give a large boost to aneconomy by swelling the ratio of workers to dependents. It has been esti-mated that the demographic dividend accounted for as much as one thirdof East Asia's \"economic miracle\". 60 A more thorough investigation of the impacts of vaccination, then, should look not just at direct medical cost savings and averted illness, butalso at the effects on cognitive development, educational attainment, laborproductivity, income, savings, investment, and fertility. 3.3 The benefits of vaccination\u2014new evidence The effect of GAVI (see Table 1) We have carried out calculations for two vaccination campaigns, takinginto account the broader economic impacts of immunization. The firststudy assesses GAVI's program to extend the use of the traditional basicchildhood vaccination package; increase coverage of the under-used Hib,hepatitis B, and yellow fever vaccines; and help finance the introductionof anticipated vaccines covering pneumococcal disease, rotavirus, andmeningococcal A/C conjugate. This program will operate in 75 low-income countries with a combined population of 3.8 billion from2005-2020, and will cost $13 billion. We examine the likely effect of theprogram on worker productivity at the individual level. The second studycovers efforts in the Philippines to immunize children with DTP , TB,polio, and measles vaccines. It measures vaccines' effects on children'scognitive development, an important determinant of adult earnings. The countries involved in the GAVI immunization program suffer from high rates of child mortality. In countries that are not covered by the pro-gram, there are fewer than 10 child deaths per thousand live births. In theGAVI countries, there are over 65 deaths per thousand. GAVI estimatesthat its program will reduce child mortality by 4 deaths per thousand livebirths in 2005, and by 12 per thousand by 2020 as the campaign expands. We used a life table to translate averted deaths into increased probabil- ity of adult survival (the proportion of 15 year olds who reach age 60), and 60Bloom, David E. & Williamson, Jeffrey G.

T o translate the latter into growth of wages and income per capita, we used estimates in the economics literature from Shastry and Weil (2003)and Weil (2005) 61that show the link between health and wages in indi- viduals.62This analysis shows that for a group of 1,000 adults, for each additional person surviving from age 15 to 60, average wages rise by 0.179per cent. Based on the assumption that labor productivity and wagesaccount for two-thirds of national income, 63we calculate that each extra surviving adult in a group of 1,000 boosts income per capita by 0.119 percent. From this figure, we calculate that the average percentage increase in income for the children whose immunization coverage increases throughthe GAVI program will rise from 0.78 per cent in 2005 to 2.39 per cent by2020. This equates to an increase in annual earnings per child of $14 by2020 (see table 1). The total increase in income per year once the vacci-nated cohort of children start earning will rise from $410 million in 2005 to$1.34 billion by 2020 (at a cost of $638 million in 2005 and $748 million in2020). We estimate the internal rate of return to the program by calculating the interest rate that would make the net present value of the flow of futurebenefits equal the initial costs. The rate of return amounts to 12.4 per centin 2005, rising to 18 per cent in 2020 as vaccine costs decline. These areconservative estimates, since they do not take account of averted medicalcosts, the value of reduced pain and suffering among survivors, welfarebenefits associated with averted deaths, or demographic dividend effects. If these additional benefits of vaccination had been included, it is likely that the rate of return would be higher still, and possibly much higher, but 61Shastry, G. K. & Weil, D. N. (2002): \"How Much of Cross-Country Income Variation is Explained by Health?\" Journal of the European Economic Association , 1: 387-396. Weil, D.N. (2005): \"Accounting for the Effect of Health on Economic Growth\", Mimeo , Department of Economics, Brown University. 62This approach assumes that health is a uni-dimensional variable that is reflected in mortality and morbidity measures. Both microeconomic and macroeconomic studies of the effect of health on labor productivity use thisapproach, which enables a single measure to be used as an indicator of an individual's or a community's health.In our study, the health improvements generated by vaccination are therefore taken to have economic impactssimilar to those of health improvements on average. 63See Hall, R. E., & Jones, C. I. (1999): \"Why Do Some Countries Produce So Much More Output Per Worker Than Others? Quarterly Journal of Economics 114(1): 83-116.36 WORLD ECONOMICS Vol. 6 No. 3 July-September 2005 David E. Bloom, David Canning & Mark Weston even these conservative estimates compare favorably with the average rates of return to schooling. A review of 98 country studies from 1960 to1997 showed that the average returns for primary, secondary and highereducation were 19 per cent, 13 per cent and 11 per cent respectively. 64 This finding suggests that the benefits of vaccination have been greatlyunderestimated and amounts to a strong argument for increased immu-nization in developing countries. Immunization and cognitive development\u2014evidence from the Philippines In the Philippines study, we examined the effect of immunization on pro-ductivity by looking at its impact on test scores that measure the cognitiveability of ten year olds. There is robust evidence that childhood illness canimpair cognitive development, and that the latter affects adult productiv-ity and earnings. Since our data cover children born in 1983-84 and thusdo not offer information on wages, we take scores in cognitive tests at theage of ten as an indicator of likely productivity in adulthood. Our study involves a sample of 1975 children from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS). CLHNS is part ofa longitudinal survey of Filipino women and their children born in theyear following 1 May 1983. The women lived in 33 districts of the metro-politan Cebu area. Bi-monthly interviews carried out over two years allowus to track immunization activities in the first two years of a child's life,while a follow-up study conducted between October 1994 and October1995 provides us with scores on language, mathematics, and IQ tests. We compared the test score results of children who had received the basic six vaccines (DTP , polio, measles, and TB) in the first two years oflife with those who had received no vaccinations. It is important to recog-nize, of course, that children who are immunized have other advantagesthat make them more likely to succeed in cognitive tests. For example,they may receive a better education or hail from families that place agreater emphasis on health in general, meaning they would score wellwhether or not they were immunized. In order to eliminate these effects,we used a propensity score matching method that matches each child inthe treatment group with a similar control group. We matched children onthe probability that they would be vaccinated given their characteristics\u2014 64Psacharopoulos, G. & Patrinos, H. (2002): \"Returns to Investment in Education: A Further Update\", World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 2881, September. WORLD ECONOMICS Vol. 6 No. 3 July-September 2005 37The Value of Vaccination that is, their \"propensity scores\". Groups of children with a certain propen- sity score were matched with control groups whose propensity scores areclose to their own, with the closest-matched groups given more weight. 65 After controlling for these observed characteristics we found that immu- nization was associated with significantly improved scores in IQ, language,and mathematics tests. The effect was stronger (significant at the 5% con-fidence level) for IQ and language scores than for mathematics (where theeffect was significant at the 10% level). Childhood vaccination appears tohave positive and long-term health impacts that translate into increasedcognitive ability in ten year olds, which in turn is associated with higherearnings in adulthood. In both our studies, then, we found significant positive impacts of vac- cination programs. As well as improving health, vaccines have long-termeffects on the development of an individual. These individual effects,which are produced at a remarkably low cost, are likely to translate intolasting impacts on economies. Summary Clearly there is scope for more research to be conducted on the diversebenefits of vaccination. The Miller and McCann study cited above showsthat rates of return differ by country and by income group. It is likely theyalso differ by the type of vaccine delivered. Further research is needed tocalculate the value of vaccination for different countries and at differentstages of development. However, immunization does appear to be animportant tool for improving survival and strengthening economies. Byboosting cognitive abilities, it improves children's prospects of successwhen reaching working age. And it does so in an extremely cost-beneficialway. Immunization provides a large return on a small investment\u2014higherthan most other health interventions, and at least as high as non-healthdevelopment interventions such as education. There is a strong case, therefore, for a renewed international commit- ment to vaccination. The impressive progress towards universal basic vac-cine coverage in the 1970s and 1980s has stalled in the past decade, andseveral damaging childhood illnesses have begun to return as a result. A 65Full details of the methodology are available in Bloom, Canning, and Seiguer (2005): \"Immunization as Human Capital\", Mimeo , Harvard School of Public Health.38 WORLD ECONOMICS Vol. 6 No. 3 July-September 2005 David E. Bloom, David Canning & Mark Weston revived commitment to vaccination requires action on several fronts. First, the public health establishment must communicate clearer and more com-pelling messages about the value of vaccination. The targets of such com-munication should include governments in developed and developingcountries, as well as donors that fund vaccination in the latter. Second,these messages should move beyond explanation of the effect of immu-nization on health and on medical costs to address the broader impacts oneconomies. Vaccination is not purely a health sector issue\u2014it has reso-nance for wider economic planning and for long-term economic progress.Apprising finance ministries of its importance is vital for cementing itsposition in development policy. The third area where renewed action is needed relates to leadership. At an international level, GAVI has begun to increase awareness of the valueof vaccination and to push multiple partners toward expanding its breadthand scope. At the national level, politicians' commitment is important indriving immunization campaigns forward. T raditionally, individuals havesubmitted to state encouragement to vaccinate because they have trustedgovernment to act in their best interests. Recent problems with vaccines,along with efforts (valid or not) of those who continue to argue that vac-cines are unsafe, are weakening this trust. Politicians are not elected onvaccination platforms, so there is no pressure on them to champion vac-cines once in power. However, the confusion caused by British PrimeMinister T ony Blair's refusal to reveal whether his own son had receivedthe MMR vaccine at the height of the MMR scare highlights the dangersof equivocal leadership on such sensitive issues. Blair's lack of clarity,which was the subject of extensive media coverage, may have increaseduncertainty over the vaccine. 66Public complacency, as measles outbreaks that have followed declines in vaccination coverage in the developedworld show, can quickly imperil health, and governments and donors thatrecognize the benefits of immunization must continually hammer thepoint home. T raditionally, governments and donors have only considered the health impacts of vaccine-preventable illnesses, and their effect on overall wel-fare has been underestimated. However, new evidence on the importanceof health as a driver of economic development and poverty reduction 66Lewis and Speers (2003) op cit.WORLD ECONOMICS Vol. 6 No. 3 July-September 2005 39The Value of Vaccination suggests the need for a re-think. Vaccines in particular, as the evidence presented in this paper shows, are an inexpensive and extremely effectivemeans of improving health and overall welfare. Their impacts, moreover,are much greater than previously thought. Making the push to complete worldwide vaccination coverage will be a difficult task, and finding ways of ensuring the continued development ofeffective vaccines in the future is potentially more complex still. Vaccinesshould be seen not as a cost that swells public health budget requirements,but as an investment with enduring and large-scale impacts. The benefitsof a push for increased immunization are likely to heavily outweigh thecosts, and policy makers who neglect immunization will be missing a greatopportunity for promoting development. "}
