Roswell Park Named LGBTQ+ Healthcare Equality Leader The Human Rights Campaign Foundation \u2014 one of the most influential platforms in diversity, equity and inclusion \u2014 released its Healthcare Equality Index (HEI) for 2022. Thanks to the incredible work of the LGBTQ+ Task Force we set in motion two years ago, and efforts across our team, Roswell Park has not only been named to this prestigious list \u2014 we earned a perfect score and have been acknowledged as a Healthcare Equality Leader . Since 1980, the Human Rights Campaign has been the country's largest civil rights organization working to achieve equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer/questioning people. The 2022 report highlights nearly 500 organizations nationally that have e arned the Leader designation for their proactive efforts to ensure high -quality, equitable care for individuals who identify as LGBTQ+. CLINICAL AND SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS New guidelines make lung cancer screening more widely available to those who need it most For the first time since 2013, a U.S. task force has released new guidelines on who should undergo annual low -dose CT (LDCT) scans for lung cancer, the nation's leading cause of cancer deaths. The task force now recommends lung screening for a dults 50 years of age, or older who smoked the equivalent of a pack a day for 20 years or longer, and who continue to smoke at that rate or have quit in the last 15 years. This equates to screening five years earlier than recommended by previous guidelines , and screening people with 10 fewer years of smoking exposure. Mary Reid, MSPH, PhD , Chief of Cancer Screening, Survivorship and Mentorship, helped advocate for this important nationwide changes, and is happy the new guidelines now include many more at -risk smokers and former smokers who were not previously eligible for screening. Thwarting serious side effects of CAR T -cell therapy Roswell Park team develops strategy for early detection and intervention to prevent lasting side effects of treatment At Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Philip McCarthy, MD , and a multidisciplinary team of colleagues undertook a study t o understand how patients receiving CAR T -cell therapy were developing neurologic toxicity, a side effect that damages the nervous system and can result in limb weakness, memory or vision loss, headache and cognitive and behavioral changes. Prior to this study , a 2019 consensus panel developed a grading system for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell -associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) resulting from chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T -cell therapy. This system has been important for identifying, treating and monitoring CRS and especially ICANS in CAR T -cell patients. ICANS is identified and monito red by the immune effector cell -associated encephalopathy score (ICE). Cancer Innovations: Prioritizing quality of life while treating cancer Fighting cancer always comes with certain costs to the patient \u2014 side effects, time, money and days lost to fee ling unwell \u2014 but researchers at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center are trying to keep those costs low while improving the effectiveness of treatments against the cancer. Anurag Singh, MD , Director of Radiation Research in the Department of Radiation Medicine and Co-Leader of the Cell Stress and Biophysical Therapy Program, and Emese Zsiros, MD, PhD, FACOG, Director of Research in the Department of Gynecologic Oncology, are among the Roswell Park doctors finding innovative ways to improve patients' quality of l ife without sacrificing effective cancer treatment. Dr. Singh has developed a new method for treating lung cancer with a single fraction of radiation treatment , instead of up to seven weeks of smaller doses, with reduced side effects for patients. In addition, Dr. Singh has led research into the effectiveness of an anti -seizure drug, gabapentin, in treating mucositis, painful mouth sores that can develop in patients treated fo r head and neck cancers. Typically, patients with mucositis have been treated with opioids. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network has adopted this recommendation as part of the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Head and Neck Cancers , citing a 2019 study from Roswell Park that was led by Dr. Singh. Dr. Zsiros has spent the past several years researching the use of a three -drug combination in women who are fighting metastatic recurrent ovarian cancer, helping them improve the quality of their lives and, in some cases, giving them more time. Two of the medications, Avastin and Cytoxan, have been given to ovarian cancer patients for the past 15 years. A newer drug, the checkpoint inhibitor Keytruda, has been approved for solid tumors but not for regular use against ovarian cancer. \"The rationa le was that Avastin helps to normalize tumor vessels so the immune cells can get into the tumor better. Typically, immunotherapy doesn't work well for ovarian cancer, because often there aren't immune cells inside the tumor.\" When used together, however, t he three drugs help immune cells get inside the tumor to fight the cancer cells, providing patients who had been looking at palliative care the chance for longer survival. This work was highlighted in JAMA Oncology last fall. Neurofibromatosis clinic at Roswell Park brings experts together to tackle complex genetic condition Considered one of the more common genetic disorders, neurofibromatosis (NF) is a complex condition that requires patients to seek care from experts across numerous specialties. Recognizing the extensive speciali zed care patients with this condition require to monitor and address their symptoms, and the lack of understanding of this condition in the community, doctors at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center have launched a dedicated neurofibromatosis care program . The Neurofibromatosis Clinic provides a multidisciplinary, coordinated approach to patient care, uniting the skill and expertise of providers in many different areas: Experienced diagnostic radiologists to provide prompt, accurate diag nosis Comprehensive clinical care from medical oncologists, surgical oncologists, neurosurgeons and neuro -oncologists Clinical geneticists to confirm diagnosis, plan treatment and guide testing of other family members Plastic and reconstructive surgeons to offer options for tumor removal and improved appearance Supportive care from specialists in pain management, social work and young adult health Cancer screening and surveillance for ongoing monitoring The clinic is one of the fe w centers in the U.S. to provide coordinated, comprehensive care for adults with NF. Roswell Park, Wilmot Cancer Institute collaborate on first large study of immunotherapy in black cancer patients A new collaboration between two Western New York cancer research leaders will help oncologists learn whether Black and white cancer patients respond differently to a game - changing immunotherapy treatment, and seeks to improve the safety and effectiveness o f these newer drugs in diverse populations. Funded by a two -year, $2.08 million grant from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), with the possibility of additional funding after the initial phase of study concludes, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center and the University of Rochester's Wilmot Cancer Institute are working together to fill a major gap in the science around immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Research from Roswell Park and Kaiser Permanente supports vitamin D supplementation for breast cancer patients The joint Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center/Kaiser Permanente Northern California team behind a new study to be highlighted at the Americ an Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2021 virtual annual meeting has found that sufficient vitamin D levels at the time of diagnosis are associated with improved outcomes among people with breast cancer. The new research, presented by first author Song Yao, PhD , is based on Kaiser Permanente Northern California's Pathways Study \u2014 a large prospect ive study in breast cancer patients that has been underway since 2006 under the direction of Larry Kushi, ScD , who is Senior Author on the new study. Dr. Yao highlighted the team's findings in a poster discussion session today. The presentation is Clinically sufficient vita min D levels at breast cancer diagnosis and survival outcomes in a prospective cohort of 3,995 patients after a median follow -up of 10 years (abstract 10510). Biomarker uncovered by Roswell Park team identifies NET patients likely to have blood side effects from PRRT New work from a team at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center will help guide the care of patients with neuroendocrine tumors, or NETs. In a poster presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) virtual Annual Meeting 2021, Abhay Singh, MD, MPH , and colleagues outline their discovery of a potential biomar ker to predict which patients are likely to experience blood toxicity side effects from a new targeted radiation treatment, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). While PRRT has been shown to be beneficial for patients with neuroendocrine tumors, it sometimes causes hematologic side effects that can be permanent. The study, Mutant PPM1D and TP53 populate the hematopoietic compartment after peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) exposure (abstract 10605), demonstrates that clonal expansion of ce lls harboring certain genetic mutations contributes to blood toxicities following this treatment. Roswell Park Team Demonstrates Safe Approach for Dramatically Reducing Use of Opioids Following Surgery Restrictive protocol resulted in 45% reduction in opioids prescribed, cancer center reports at ASCO 2021 Seeing an opportunity to safely reduce the number of opioid doses prescribed to patients undergoing surgery, gynecologic oncologist Emese Zsiros, MD, PhD, FACOG, proposed a new pain -manage ment guideline for all patients undergoing surgery at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center. The results from the first 6 months of that ambitious effort, reported at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2021 virtual annual meeting today, sh ow that this opioid -restricting protocol resulted in a 45% decrease in the amount of opioids prescribed, without any significant effect on patient recovery or satisfaction. \"The rates of opioid prescription in the United States for routine surgeries are significantly higher than in many European and Asian countries,\" notes study first author Jason Ricciuti, MD, a Gynecologic Oncology Fellow at Roswell Park, who is sharing the findings (abstract 103) in an invited talk today during the 10:30 a.m. Novel Initiatives to Address Disparities in Cancer session. \"This is particularly problematic, because persistent opioid use has been observed in 6% to 8% of people who were not taking opioids until they underwent surgery.\" New Insights on Sarcomatoi d Kidney Cancer: Roswell Park Reports Clear Benefit from Checkpoint Inhibitors Six-center study, largest of its kind in patients with this aggressive subtype of renal cancer, reported at ASCO 2021 New collaborative research shows that treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has led to a significant improvement in survival and response rates among patients with a particularly aggressive type of kidney cancer: advanced sarcomatoid renal cel l carcinoma. The study, which was led by a team from Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center and involved contributors from six centers, is detailed in a presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2021 virtual annual meeting (abstract 4568) . \"We demonstrate that patients treated with this form of immunotherapy had markedly higher overall survival and response rates compared to those who had never received checkpoint inhibitors,\" says study first author Dharmesh Gopalakrishnan, MD , a Hematology -Oncology Fellow at Roswell Park who earned a 2021 ASCO Annual Meeting Merit Award for this mentored project. \"The benefits persisted even if the immune checkpoint inhibitor was administered in the second line or beyond, and among patients with non -clear cell histology \u2014 the hardest -to-treat sarcomatoid kidney cancer s.\" Breast Cancer Study: African Americans Not Experiencing Complete Response to Extent Other Groups Are At ASCO 2021, Roswell Park presents largest study to look at race and complete response to cancer treatment Researchers at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center led the largest study to date to suggest an improving trend in pathologic complete response rates over time for U.S. cancer patients of various races. The team's findings, documented in a poster presentation at the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology virtual annual meeting (abstract 575), show that African Americans are more likely than patients from any other group to have remaini ng disease following breast cancer treatment. The researchers, led by Sung Jun Ma, MD , and Anurag Singh, MD , showed that Hispanic white and Asian/Pacific Islander patients with breast cancer were more likely to have a pathologic complete response (PCR) \u2014 or no signs of cancer in tissue samples removed during surgery \u2014 following treatment for select HER2 -positive tumors, compared to non -Hispanic white women. Black women were less likely to have a pathologic complete response for HR -negative, HER2 - positive and triple -negative tumors, but not for HR -positive, HER2 -negative tumors. Roswell Park Researchers Gear Up for ASCO 2021 Annual Meeting Also at the ASCO 2021 virtual Annual Meeting: Abhay Singh, MD, MPH, a fellow in Hematology and Medical Oncology at Roswell Park, presented Mutant PPM1D and TP53 populate the hematopoietic compartment after MBBS, -Oncology Fellow, presented Evaluating the role of baseline geriatric assessment in predicting adherence to oral targeted therapies and outcomes in older adults with non -Hodgkin lymphoma (abstract 12043 \u2014 work led by Senior Author wi Torka, MD, Assistant Professor of Oncology.

Roswell Park Experts Highlight Opportunities to Improve Outcomes for People with Gastroesophageal Cancer Drs. Sarbajit Mukherjee and Lei Deng give invited talks at E SMO World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer Two Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center experts were invited to present new insights on treatment of gastroesophageal cancers during the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) World Congress on Gastr ointestinal Cancer 2021. In their talks, both presented July 1, the Roswell Park physician -researchers highlighted easily adoptable methods that may help other clinicians to provide care supporting improved patient outcomes. Sarbajit Mukherjee, MD, MS, Assistant Professor of Oncology in the Department of Medicine, shared findings of a study showing a significant association between inflammation, cell proliferation and outcomes in patients with gastroesophageal cancer who received immunotherapy (Abstract SO-5). Roswell Park Team Shows Dendritic -Cell Vaccines Can Be Paired With Standard Therapy for Breast Cancer iPSC -derived dendritic cells can work synergistically with radiation therapy to control both local and distant tumors A research team led by Fumit o Ito, MD, PhD, FACS, of Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center reports new data on the promise of combining standard treatment for breast cancer with a particular form of cancer immunotherapy \u2014 dendritic -cell (DC) treatment vaccines. This study, publish ed in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer, is the first to demonstrate that in situ dendritic -cell vaccines can improve the effectiveness of radiation therapy for some aggressive and treatment -resistant forms of breast cancer. \"Although immunotherapy w ith primary conventional dendritic cells is a promising approach, obtaining a sufficient number of circulating conventional dendritic cells has proved difficult,\" says Dr. Ito, who is Associate Professor of Surgical Oncology at Roswell Park. Use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has been proposed to overcome that limitation, but the feasibility of this approach had not previously been demonstrated. Roswell Park Experts Share Insights on Diagnosis and Treatment of Head/Neck Cancers at AHNS 2021 Team outlines strategies to improve treatment of oral and thyroid cancers at American Head & Neck Society meeting With the international community of experts in head -and-neck cancers gathering virtually to share new ideas and treatment strategies at the Americ an Head & Neck Society (AHNS) 10th International Conference on Head and Neck Cancer, underway now, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center teams are presenting new research on both the basic science supporting new treatments as well as opportunities to im prove the early and accurate diagnosis of thyroid cancer and other head/neck malignancies. Among the 17 presentations of new research led by Roswell Park's head/neck cancer experts, representing several disciplines and expertise in both clinical and labora tory research, are three studies that may lead to development of new and more effective drugs and treatments for oral - cavity cancers and another trio of studies focused on improving the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancers. Roswell Park Researchers Uncover New Genetic Factors That Contribute to the Success of BMT Changes to donor selection may improve cancer patient outcomes following blood/marrow transplant New research from Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center has uncovered genetic factors other than human leukocyte antigen (HLA) compatibility that significantly contribute to outcomes following blood and marrow transplant (BMT) in cancer patients. This study, published in the journal EClinicalMedicine, a Lancet open access journal, c ould lead to major changes in the way blood and marrow donors and recipients are matched as well as the development of new therapies to prevent transplant -related complications. A team of investigators led by Theresa Hahn, PhD, Professor of Oncology in the Department of Cancer Prevention and Control at Roswell Park, that included collaborators from The Ohio State University, scanned the DNA of 2,887 cancer patients who underwent BMT between 2000 and 2011 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, myelodys plastic syndrome or acute lymphoblastic leukemia, along with the DNA of their healthy HLA -matched unrelated donors. Researchers Aim to Prevent Lung Cancer With Latest CIMAvax -EGF Clinical Trial Prevention study is recruiting lung cancer survivors as well as those at high risk due to smoking history A groundbreaking international collaboration brought an innovative lung cancer immunotherapy from Cuba \u2014 CIMAvax -EGF \u2014 to Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center. Now researchers at the Buffalo -based cente r are now examining whether this immunotherapy developed to treat lung cancer might prove to be an effective tool for preventing the often - deadly disease. Led by Mary Reid, MSPH, PhD, the interventional early -phase clinical trial is currently recruiting for participants who fall into two groups, or cohorts \u2014 middle -aged individuals who currently smoke or have quit smoking within 15 years and carry other lung cancer risk factors like COPD, family history of the disease or have high -risk occupational exposure s but have not been diagnosed with cancer as well as lung cancer survivors who have completed treatment. Roswell Park Researchers Identify Key Link Between Stress and Cancer Stress pathway involving beta -adrenergic receptors fuels tumor growth Stress can have a significant negative effect on health, but our understanding of how stress impacts the development and progression of cancer is just beginning. A team from Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center has identified an important mechanism by which chron ic stress weakens immunity and promotes tumor growth. Their findings, just published in Cell Reports, point to the beta -adrenergic receptor ( -AR) as a driver of immune suppression and cancer growth in response to stress, opening the possibility of targeti ng this receptor in cancer therapy and prevention. Using a preclinical model of triple -negative breast cancer, a research team led by Hemn Mohammadpour, PhD, DVM, a postdoctoral research affiliate in the lab of Elizabeth Repasky, PhD, and Dr. Repasky, who is Co -Leader of the Cell Stress and Biophysical Therapies Program and the Dr. William Huebsch Professor in Immunology at Roswell Park, found that as tumors grow, they become more sensitive to stress signals coming from the nervous system. Specifically, the researchers discovered that a population of immune cells known as myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) show an increase in the expression of -AR, a molecule that controls the function of key immune cells. Roswell Park Team Will Co -Lead $10 Million N ational Cancer Institute -Funded Global Tobacco Study Prestigious federal grant renewal continuing effort to understand impact of tobacco policies worldwide Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center is one of three lead centers that are part of an internatio nal multicenter team that has recently been awarded $10 million to study how tobacco control policies impact smoking, vaping and the use of other nicotine products. Scientists from Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Medical University of South Carolina and the University of Waterloo (Canada) are leading this five -year international study funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), which will evaluate the behavioral and long -term health impact of different regulatory approaches to e -cigarettes and other new nicotine products among youth and adults in seven countries. Roswell Park Hematologists Present New Research on FLT3 Inhibitors, CART -19 at ASH Annual Meeting Teams led or contributed to highly anticipated studies on new treatments for acute leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center hematology experts in leukemia, lymphoma and other specialties will present new research at the 63rd annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH), which begins toda y in Atlanta, Georgia. The many research projects to be highlighted include breakthrough research on CAR T cell therapy, immunotherapy, leukemia, lymphoma and the management of genetic mutations in aggressive and rare blood cancers. \"We're excited to share insights from our work to develop new and better therapies for patients with blood cancers. Our presentations range from the results of early -stage research on new, promising treatment options to major international studies that are already changing the w ay we treat some cancers and providing the support for new drug approvals,\" says Philip McCarthy, MD, Vice Chair of Hematologic Malignancies and Director of Transplant & Cellular Therapy. Roswell Park/Ohio State Team Identifies Accelerator of Treatment -Resistant Prostate Cancer Research uncovers a gene that fuels disease progression by rewiring the cancer epigenome An international research team co -led by scientists at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center and The Ohio State University Comprehensive Can cer Center - Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute has identified an important accelerator of treatment -resistant prostate cancer. The study, published today in Cell Reports, provides insight into how loss or mutation of the NCOR2 gene accelerates the progression of prostate cancer to a more lethal form of the disease. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men, primarily because many patients with aggressive forms of the disease eventually expe rience progression or recurrence despite treatment. There is a need for new insights into the mechanisms of prostate cancer recurrence, which are multiple and complex, in order to develop new therapeutic targets. Daily Vaping Dramatically Ups Quit Rate in Heavy Smokers Not Aiming to Quit Roswell Park research uncovers eightfold greater odds of quitting with daily e -cigarette use Since the introduction of electronic cigarettes, or e -cigarettes, to the United States in 2006, intense debate has surrounded the marketing, regulation and use of these nicotine -delivery products. Surprising new research led by Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center has found that adult smokers with no plans to quit are more likely to quit smoking traditional combust ible cigarettes if they switch to daily vaping. The Roswell Park study, published today in JAMA Network Open, used data collected from 2014 to 2019 as part of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, a long -term study on tobacco use an d how it affects the health of youth and adults in the United States. When the researchers focused their analysis on a select group of 1,600 smokers who initially had no plans to quit and were not using e -cigarettes when the study began, they found that those who subsequently vaped daily experienced eightfold higher odds of quitting traditional cigarettes compared to those who didn't use e -cigarettes at all. Early Troponin Monitoring Can Help Detect Immunotherapy -Related Myocarditis Roswell Park research s uggests levels of this protein can predict a rare but fatal side effect of cancer treatment A multidisciplinary team led by Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center has identified troponin, a protein that enters the bloodstream only when the heart is damag ed, as an early and reliable predictor of myocarditis in cancer patients receiving immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) drugs. Findings of this retrospective study, which have been published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer, sugge st that weekly troponin monitoring during the first six weeks of treatment could help physicians detect this rare but potentially fatal side effect of cancer immunotherapy. Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising cancer treatment, particularly for solid t umors like melanoma. A handful of FDA -approved drugs such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab are increasingly used in certain types of immunotherapy to \"supercharge\" the patient's immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. Although it occurs in fewer than 1% of cases, potentially fatal inflammation of the heart muscle called myocarditis can occur as a result of ICI immunotherapy. Early detection of myocarditis, which carries a 40% to 50% risk of death, is critical, but there are currently no clear ways to accurately predict or identify this type of ICI - associated toxicity. Sensitivity to Chemotherapy May Guide Treatment of Patients with Stomach Cancer Roswell Park study finds that preoperative chemosensitivity can predict the need for chemotherapy afte r surgery A study led by scientists at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center shows that chemotherapy after surgery for gastric adenocarcinoma is significantly associated with longer survival in patients with chemosensitive disease, but not in those with very sensitive or refractory disease. These findings, which were recently published in the journal JAMA Network Open, suggest that assessing how responsive a tumor appears to be to treatment with chemotherapy before surgery can be used to guide decisions regarding postoperative chemotherapy, thereby personalizing treatment of patients with this type of stomach cancer. \"Many patients with gastric cancer who are eligible for surgical resection, or removal of stomach tissue, re ceive chemotherapy both before and after surgery to maximize their chance of survival,\" says first author Lei Deng, MD, a Hematology -Oncology Fellow at Roswell Park. \"However, patients do not respond to chemotherapy equally. Some patients will have no canc er cells at the time of surgery or will learn that their tumors have shrunk, while others may be told that their tumors have stayed the same size or even grown larger.\" Roswell Park team members create data tool for researchers A team of Roswell Park coll aborators has launched nSight \u2014 a web -based tool for exploring and analyzing various data sources in support of research, grant applications, study design and academic publications. A team of contributors from Information Technology, the Biomedical Resea rch Informatics Shared Resource, the Office of Research Subject Protection and Information Security developed the platform to allow researchers self -service access to the rich data sources at Roswell Park. COMMUNITY SUPPORT AND ADVOCACY Top cancer cente rs unite in urgent call on HPV vaccination Roswell Park was among the 71 NCI -designated cancer centers that united to urge physicians, parents and young adults to get cancer -preventing human -papillomavirus (HPV) vaccinations back on track. Dramatic drops in annual well visits and immunizations related to the COVID -19 pandemic have caused a significant vaccination gap and a lag in vital preventive services among U.S children and adolescents.

Congressman Higgins & Roswell Park CEO Dr. Candace Johnson Join Congressional Cancer Caucus Briefing as the U.S. Marks the 50th Anniversary of the National Cancer Act Congressman Brian Higgins (NY -26) and Roswell Park CEO Dr. Candace Johnson recently joine d a Congressional Cancer Caucus briefing with National Cancer Institute director Dr. Ned Sharpless and other national leaders discussing the National Cancer Act, which was signed into law on December 23, 1971, and efforts to continue making strides in canc er research and treatment. As co -chair of the Cancer Caucus, Congressman Higgins has long advocated for significant federal investments in cancer research and treatment. He spoke to members and national leaders during the briefing saying during the discuss ion, \"So many strides have been made. Before the 'War on Cancer' was declared, less than 50 percent of those who were diagnosed lived beyond five years of the diagnosis. Today it's 65 percent for adults and over 80 percent for kids. That is a major, major step forward attributed to the great work of all of those who do cancer research, but also to the federal government's commitment to funding groundbreaking research.\" Also in celebration of this important national milestone and Roswell Park's key role in t he formation of our national cancer centers program: - We launched a yearlong \" We Set the Model\" informational campaign , highlighting important moments, people and innovations from our 120 -plus-year history that have impacted the world of cancer and beyond. - We hosted a webinar with Congressman Higgins, a woman treated for cancer at Roswell Park as a toddler in the 1970s, and others highlighting the visit by Congressional Subcommittee to Roswell Park in October 1971, shaping the legis lation that would become the National Cancer Act of 1971.
