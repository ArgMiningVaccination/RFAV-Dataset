I saw Ann and was amazed at her ability to get at the root of what is going on emotionally and physically. I have a back injury which I went to PT for a year for and it has still never been quite the same. After just two visits with her, I am already feeling a lot of improvement. I highly recommend going to see Ann! I was referred to Dr. Ann Barter by a friend and so I made an appointment. She adjusted me in ways I've never been adjusted before. It was the most thorough adjustment I've ever had. She even adjusted my cranial sutures. Awesome! Dr. Ann Barter is incredibly talented and supportive. She quickly assessed my blood work and helped me adjust my diet and lifestyle to not only greatly improve my complexion and energy levels, but also my overall well being. M: 9:00 AM - 5:30 PM (DEN.)
