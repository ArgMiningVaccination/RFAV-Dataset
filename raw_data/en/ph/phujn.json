Here's Your Step-by-Step Guide to Performing a Burning Ceremony: Performing a burning ceremony can be done alone or with your loved ones. You need a safe space and container to perform the ceremony. In a nutshell, you'll start by writing what you want to let go of, and then you'll burn that piece of paper. Keep reading for further instructions. Supplies You'll Need For the Burning Ceremony: - Paper - Pen - Matches or a lighter - A safe, burn-friendly receptacle or surface (like a metal or glass bowl or fireplace) Precautions Before You Start While preparing for the ceremony, it's important to clear your head of any anger or irritation because it's not advised to burn in the \"heat of the moment.\" The ritual has more impact when it is done in a peaceful, grounded state of mind. Do not burn something valuable out of spite, like legal documents or something that could be important to another person. If you feel you must burn memories, you can choose to burn old photographs or letters. Avoid burning something that is highly flammable or something that can cause you harm. It is important to approach this burning ceremony with caution and in a safe space. Step 1: Create Your Burning Ceremony Space A burning ceremony shouldn't be performed in a confined or enclosed space, as it can pose a threat to you and others. Use a large enough unburnable bowl or a container (like metal or glass). Be aware of your environment or surroundings - they need to be peaceful in order to focus completely on the ritual - and also need to be a safe place to burn like a fireplace. Step 2: Set a Clear Intention Throughout the burning ceremony, remain calm and grounded in your intent. The ceremony should not be performed to shake away anger or frustration. If you can't shake a negative mindset, [meditate to relax your mood](http://youaligned.com/yoga/10-minute-guided-mindfulness-meditation/) before you begin the ceremony. Some intentions that work well: - I am peaceful - I am grounded - I let go of attachments - I find peace when I let go When your intentions are clear and focused, you can determine what you want out of this ceremony. You can write down your feelings and intentions so you are more open and ready for release. Step 3: Get Grounded Literally sit down or stand firmly with both feet on the ground for a few moments until you feel present and grounded. As negativity or tension releases from your body, let it pass. Stand quietly in prayer or meditation, while you honor your commitment to change. Step 4: Write and Burn What You Want to Let Go Write down what you're ready to let go of on your piece of paper. Now that you have listed what you want to let go, it's time to burn. Light the piece of paper on fire, and place it in your burn-friendly receptacle. Watch it burn, take a few deep breaths, and rub your hands together for a final release of the attachment you just let go of. Whether good or bad, anything that's holding you back needs to be released. Burn the lists and letters, and you will start to feel the attachment leave your body and mind.

Let the burning ceremony allow you to sense a feeling of closure, and move on.
