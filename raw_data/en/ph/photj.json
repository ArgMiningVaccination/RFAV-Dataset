[[5]](#cite_note-5) Although SCNM both requires and administers vaccinations ( [Hepatitis B](/wiki/Hepatitis_B), [MMR](/wiki/MMR_vaccine), [COVID](/wiki/COVID)), their allowed exemptions are broad, allowing by medical and religious exemptions.

[[14]](#cite_note-14) Arizona has the \"broadest naturopathic scope of practice\" and \"may be the worst-case scenario of any state licensing pseudoscience as medicine.\" [[15]](#cite_note-wildwest-15) Unlike many states, Arizona allows NDs to administer substances (including vitamins, pharmaceuticals, and natural substances) intravenously, and conduct minor surgery (though what 'minor' is is not defined in the law) [[15]](#cite_note-wildwest-15) [[16]](#cite_note-16) IV administration is such a favorite procedure at SCNM, that it alluded to in their website's page-not-found (404) error message with \"Uh Oh, 404 \u2014 Vein Not Found\". [[17]](#cite_note-17) Clinics[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Southwest_College_of_Naturopathic_Medicine&action=edit\u00a7ion=4)] SCNM offers medical clinics on and off campus, they include regular naturopathic care, [HIV/AIDS](/wiki/HIV/AIDS) care, [addiction](/wiki/Addiction) support, and one for [abused women](/wiki/Domestic_violence) and [children](/wiki/Child_abuse). [[18]](#cite_note-18) - Hamilton Elementary Clinic SCNM has offered a naturopathy clinic at the Arthur M. Hamilton Elementary in Phoenix. The elementary school primarily serves [poor](/wiki/Poor) families. Despite the most prevalent health issues including including serious problems (diabetes, asthma, ADD) that are treatable by evidence-based medicine, SCNM offers ineffective treatments (acupuncture, physical medicine, supplementation and homeopathy). [[19]](#cite_note-19) - Mission of Mercy Arizona Mission of Mercy Arizona is a [Christian](/wiki/Christian) non-profit organization that provides free health care to people who cannot afford it. [[20]](#cite_note-20) SCNM students partner with the Mission of Mercy while staying out of the way of actual medical providers and not providing naturopathic treatments while possibly offending poor people about their \"lifestyles\" (\"You will learn to work efficiently alongside conventional medical providers, and you will use modalities such as medications and lifestyle changes.\"). [[21]](#cite_note-21) - The River Source The River Source is a for-profit naturopathic addiction treatment center based on the twelve-step methodology of [Alcoholics Anonymous](/wiki/Alcoholics_Anonymous). [[22]](#cite_note-22) River Source has stated that its programs are cheaper than others because \"have a partnership with the Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine, allowing us to offer the latest advances in naturopathic medicine at a reduced cost.\" [[23]](#cite_note-23) Despite this claim, SCNM has offered archaic, ineffective (acupuncture, cupping therapy) and potentially dangerous treatments ( [detox](/wiki/Detox), nutritional IV therapy) at River Source. [[24]](#cite_note-24) - Sojourner Center The Sojourner Center is a large center in Phoenix that offers support to victims of [domestic violence](/wiki/Domestic_violence). It is an entirely independent organization. Both the SCNM and the Phoenix Children's Hospital Medical Mobile Unit have offered free on-site healthcare to transitional housing participants of the Center. [[25]](#cite_note-25) It is unclear how cases where [evidence-based medical](/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine) advice contradicts naturopathic advice are handled. The SCNM has stated that they offer the \"full scope of naturopathic modalities\", including \"acupuncture, homeopathy, [supplementation](/wiki/Vitamin_and_mineral_supplements) and [botanicals](/wiki/Herbal_supplement)\" to participants. [[26]](#cite_note-26) - Southwest Center for HIV/AIDS Clinic [HIV/AIDS](/wiki/HIV/AIDS) The Southwest Center for HIV/AIDS Clinic existed from around 2014-2018.
