Learn more about [Yale's Vaccination Policy](/covid-19-vaccination-policy). If I test positive for COVID-19 using an at-home rapid antigen test (at-home test), do I need to report my positive result to Yale? Faculty, students, and staff who test positive for COVID-19 with home tests or at non-Yale University testing centers should submit a photo of the test and any related medical records for review to Yale Health by [completing the online form](https://yale-medicine.my.salesforce-sites.com/yalehealth/covid_selfreporting) and are encouraged to call their health care providers to determine if they are [eligible for treatment](https://view.message.yale.edu/?qs=5d324796ef6cd8feae253cf480633c893e8eabd933352a13fbebeb1dbf15a5ff9e178095a71a3483e44894a2c34b3e241bb0359b8b5fde56c9f6a7605d4cab5894c366a404a8d6cdfedf8ae7e1a6184e). If there is a need to isolate due to COVID diagnosis or recover from a vaccine/booster, will Yale pay me or my staff member a normal salary and/or will we have to use paid time off? Staff members who need to isolate due to COVID or are recovering from a reaction to a vaccine/booster are encouraged to use sick time. How should I provide instruction to students who are sick or isolating? Instructors are encouraged to be as accommodating as possible\u2014to the extent pedagogically and practically feasible\u2014with students who are required to miss class because they are experiencing cold symptoms or are in isolation. While instructors may make short-term individual arrangements for remote instruction for students who are isolating, they may not approve such arrangements for a period of more than two weeks. Longer term absences must be approved by the student's dean or the dean's designee. Deans or their designees have the agency to determine reasonable school- or unit-specific arrangements. "}
