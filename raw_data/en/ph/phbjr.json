Natural and organic are terms that are often used interchangeably, but they do have different meanings. Beauty products that are labeled as natural contain fewer synthetic ingredients than their conventional counterparts. Manufacturers typically substitute minerals, herbal extracts, plant oils and butters and other ingredients for as many ingredients as possible when formulating natural products. Organic formulas are natural beauty products that have earned certification from an independent organization like the United States Department of Agriculture. Each certifying organization sets its own standards for what qualifies as organic. Usually, products must be made primarily out of ingredients that are grown without the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers and manufactured in ways that respect the planet. Keep in mind that natural beauty products may contain organic certified ingredients without earning organic certification themselves. There are a number of reasons why you may prefer to use natural or organic beauty products instead of conventional formulas. Some people select these types of formulas because they feel that plant and mineral-based products are friendlier to the planet. Certified organic solutions are especially ideal for those who are green minded. Others go the natural route because they are sensitive or allergic to certain chemical ingredients commonly used in conventional beauty products. People may also prefer the natural fragrances of products scented with herbal extracts rather than synthetic fragrance.
