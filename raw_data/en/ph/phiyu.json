The year 2020 threw at the world a bedlam of novel COVID-19 virus, threatening all that was taken for granted -mobility, safety, and a normal life itself. This, in turn, posed the most formidable economic challenge to India and to the world in a century. Bereft of a cure or a vaccine, public health policy became central to tackling this all-pervasive crisis. The imperative of flattening the disease curve was entwined with the livelihood cost of an imminent recession, which emanated from the restrictions in economic activities from the lockdown required to contain the pandemic. This inherent trade-off led to the policy dilemma of \"lives versus livelihoods\". Governments and central banks across the world deployed a range of policy tools to support their economies such as lowering key policy rates, quantitative easing measures, loan guarantees, cash transfers and fiscal stimulus measures. India recognised the disruptive impact of the pandemic and charted its own unique path amidst dismal projections by several international institutions of the spread in the country given its huge population, high population density and an overburdened health infrastructure. As shown in Chapter 1 of Volume 1, the intense lockdown implemented at the start of the pandemic - when India had only a 100 confirmed cases - characterized India' s unique response in several ways. First, the policy response was driven by the findings from both epidemiological and economic research. Specifically, faced with enormous uncertainty about the potential spread of the pandemic, the policy implemented the Nobel-prize winning research in Hansen and Sargent (2001) that recommends a policy focussed on minimising losses in a worst case scenario. Faced with an unprecedented pandemic, loss of scores of human lives captured this worst case scenario. Moreover, epidemiological research highlighted the importance of an initial, stringent lockdown especially in a country where high population density posed difficulties with respect to social distancing. Therefore, India' s policy humane response that focused on saving human lives, recognised that the short-term pain of an initial, stringent lockdown would lead to long-term gains both in the lives saved and in the pace of the economic recovery. The scores of lives that have been saved and the V-shaped economic recovery that is being witnessed - due to the causal impact of the initial lockdown - bear testimony to India' s boldness in taking short-term pain for long-term gain. Second, India recognised that the pandemic impacts both supply and demand in the economy. The slew of reforms - again unique amidst all major economies - were implemented to ensure that the supply-side disruptions, which were inevitable during the lockdown, are minimised in the medium to long-run. The demand side policy reflected the understanding that aggregate 2 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 demand, especially that for non-essential items, reflects precautionary motives to save, which inevitably remains high when overall uncertainty is high. Therefore, during the initial months of the pandemic when uncertainty was high and lockdowns imposed economic restrictions, India did not waste precious fiscal resources in trying to pump up discretionary consumption. Instead, the policy focused on ensuring that all essentials were taken care of, which included direct benefit transfers to the vulnerable sections and the world' s largest food subsidy programme targeting 80.96 crore beneficiaries. Government of India also launched Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme to provide much needed relief to stressed sectors by helping entities sustain employment and meet liabilities. During the unlock phase, when uncertainty declined and the precautionary motive to save subsided, on the one hand, and economic mobility increased, on the other hand, India has ramped up its fiscal spending. A favorable monetary policy ensured abundant liquidity and immediate relief to debtors via temporary moratoria, while unclogging monetary policy transmission. India' s demand-side policy, thus, underscores the idea that pressing on the accelerator while the brakes are clamped only wastes scarce fuel. India has been able to avoid the second wave while ably managing to flatten the epidemiological curve, with its caseload peaking in mid-September. As shown in Chapter 1 of Volume I, the initial stringent lockdown was critical to saving lives and the V-shaped economic recovery. The continuous drop in daily cases and fatalities bespeak India' s escape from a Sisyphus fate of back-and-forth policy responses, enabling continual unlocking of the economy. As anticipated, while the lockdown resulted in a 23.9 per cent contraction in GDP in Q1, the recovery has been a V-shaped one as seen in the 7.5 per cent decline in Q2 and the recovery across all key economic indicators. Starting July, a resilient V-shaped recovery is underway, as demonstrated by the recovery in GDP growth in Q2 after the sharp decline in Q1, a sustained resurgence in high frequency indicators such as power demand, E-way bills, GST collection, steel consumption, etc. The reignited inter and intra state movement and record-high monthly GST collections have marked the unlocking of industrial and commercial activity. A sharp rise in commercial paper issuances, easing yields, and sturdy credit growth to MSMEs portend revamped credit flows for enterprises to survive and grow. Imports contracted more sharply than exports, with Forex reserves rising to cover 18 months of imports. Inflation, mainly driven by food prices, remained above 6 per cent for much of the year; the softening in December suggests easing of supply-side constraints. India' s GDP is estimated to contract by 7.7 per cent in FY2020-21, composed of a sharp 15.7 per cent decline in first half and a modest 0.1 per cent fall in the second half. Sector-wise, agriculture has remained the silver lining while contact-based services, manufacturing, construction were hit hardest, and have been recovering steadily. Government consumption and net exports have cushioned the growth from diving further down. The V-shaped economic recovery is supported by the initiation of a mega vaccination drive with hopes of a robust recovery in the services sector. Together, prospects for robust growth in consumption and investment have been rekindled with the estimated real GDP growth for FY 2021-22 at 11 per cent. India' s mature policy response to this \"once-in-a-century\" crisis thus provides important lessons for democracies to avoid myopic policymaking and demonstrates the significant benefits of focusing on long-term gains. 1.1 The year 2020 witnessed unrivalled turmoil with the novel COVID-19 virus and the resultant pandemic emerging as the biggest threat to economic growth in a century. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern' (PHEIC) on 30th January, 2020 and advised that all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, 3 State of the Economy 2020-21: A Macro View contact tracing, and prevention of onward spread. The exponential rise in the number of daily cases compelled the WHO to title this outbreak a pandemic on 11th March, 2020 - within a period of three months of its emergence. The contagion is still spreading with over 10 crore confirmed cases around the globe and over 2 lakh deaths. The ensuing shock has been extremely unconventional in terms of its size and uncertainty, with its impact dependent on unpredictable factors like intensity of lockdowns, extent of supply chain and financial market disruptions alongside societal response to the associated public health measures. The pandemic has been unique in its wide-ranging effects on almost every section of the economy and the society. SPREAD OF THE PANDEMIC Global Spread 1.2 Since its first outbreak in Wuhan, China, COVID-19 has infected all continents, including Antarctica (in December, 2020), and more than 220 countries. The health shock, though global, has transmitted through different trajectories across countries in terms of total infections, mortalities, and recoveries. In the initial stages of the pandemic, the Advanced Economies (AE) of North American and West European region were disproportionately impacted with more than 70 per cent of the total cases and total deaths (Figure 1). The pandemic quickly intensified in number of Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs) such as Brazil, India, Mexico, Russia and Turkey- that now constitute around 50 per cent of total cases and total deaths. In recent months, amidst a repeat wave, AEs\u2014particularly the United States and several Euro area countries\u2014have accounted for an increasing share of cases; in EMDEs, outbreaks in the Latin America and the Caribbean, and Europe and Central Asia regions have continued to grow. It is evident that AEs have been affected harder by the pandemic. Figure 1: Trend in World-wide Spread of COVID-19 1(a): Share in Cumulative Confirmed Cases 1(b): Share in Cumulative EMDE( excluding China) Source: WHO, Survey Calculation 1.3 The spread of the pandemic has been in waves as is evident in Figure 2. AEs were experiencing their third waves, both in terms of cases and deaths, at the end of the year while EMDEs (excluding China and India) were facing their second waves. China experienced the first wave of cases in February, 2020 after which it has been able to control the spread. India experienced its first wave till September, 2020 after which it has been able to effectively manage the spread - avoiding the second wave as on date. 4 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Figure 2: COVID -19 Infection Waves 2 (a): Confirmed Cases 01020304050607080 020406080100120 AugSepOctNovDec New cases (Thousands)New cases (Lakhs) EMDEs (excluding China and India) India Deaths (Hundreds)New deaths (Thousands) AEs EMDEs (excluding China and India) India China (RHS)First Wave Second WaveThird WaveFirst Wave SecondWave Source: Survey Calculations using data from WHO Note: data is as on 31st December, 2020 1.4 AEs witnessed higher confirmed cases and deaths on per capita basis too as compared to EMDEs (Figure 3).

India crossed its peak in mid-September with 11.12 lakh active cases on 17th September, 2020 and 97,860 daily new cases on 16th September, 2020 (Figure 4(a)). Subsequently, new cases have moved down to less than 16,000 cases per day in January, 2021 despite the festive season and onset of the winter season. The confirmed cases in India have touched more than 1.06 crore, representing around 11 per cent of the world's total case load. India's share in new cases load globally has drastically come down from 31 per cent in September, 2020 to 4 per cent in December, 2020. The pace of spread has been controlled with doubling time of cases rising from 12 days in May, 2020 to 249 days in December, 2020 (Figure 4(b)). Figure 4: Spread of COVID-19 in India 4(a): Total Active Cases Daily new case growth rate (RHS) 37121920273980143249 0 50 100 150 200 250 300MarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDec No of Days Source: Data accessed from https://www.covid19india.org/, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoH&FW) Note: Doubling rate is defined as ln2/ ln (1 + r), where r is the average of last seven days of growth in cumulative cases. 1.6 The initial spread of pandemic was limited primarily to western and northern zones of the country, which contributed 42 and 22 per cent respectively (Figure 5(a)). On the other hand, a sharp rise in share of Southern zone was witnessed since July, 2020 with the zone adding more than one-third of the new cases per month on an average. The eastern and central regions each constituted 10 per cent of the total cases respectively during the year. All zones, barring northern region, experienced a single wave of infection till December (Figure 5(b)). The festive season during October and November led to a second wave of infections in the northern region. In per capita terms, the southern zone had a maximum caseload at 1226 cases per lakh followed by western zone at 1124 cases per lakh; the eastern region had the lowest caseload at 342 cases per lakh as on 31 st December, 2020 (Figure 5(c)).Peak in mid- September6 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Figure 5: Trends in Spread of COVID-19 across Regions in India 5(a): Share in Cumulative Confirmed Cases 5(b): Infection Waves 0%20%40%60%80%100% Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep O ct Nov D ec Central Eastern North Eastern Northern Southern Western - 2 4 6 8 10 May Jun Jul Aug Sep O ct Nov D ecNew Cases (Lakh) Northern Central Eastern North Eastern Southern Western Figure 5(c): Total Confirmed Cases per Lakh Source: Data accessed from https://www.Covid19india.org/, MoH&FW Note: Data is as on 31st December, 2020; the Zones are defined as per the Zonal Councils 1.7 The total death toll in India, as on 31st December, 2020, was 1.48 lakh with more than 50 per cent of the fatalities occurring in western and southern zones of the country. Throughout the pandemic, Maharashtra has been the worst affected state having highest incidence of deaths in India (Figure 6(a)). All zones, except the northern zone, experienced a single wave in terms of deaths (Figure 6(b)). The northern region witnessed three death waves, with the third wave proving to be the most lethal as deaths exceeded 1.7 times more than what it was during the first wave. In per capita terms, the western zone has been the worst performer with 27 deaths per lakh, followed by northern region at 13 deaths per lakh (Figure 6(c)). Deaths per capita have been lower in the eastern and north-eastern zones at 6 and 4 deaths per lakh respectively. 7 State of the Economy 2020-21: A Macro View Figure 6: Trends in COVID-19 Deaths across Regions in India 6(a): Share in Total Deaths 6(b): Death Waves 0%20%40%60%80%100% Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep O ct Nov D ec Central Eastern North Eastern Northern Southern Western02468101214 May Jun Jul Aug Sep O ct Nov D ecNew Deaths ('000) Northern Central Eastern North Eastern Southern Western 6(c): Total Deaths per Lakh Source: Data accessed from https://www.Covid19india.org/, MoH&FW Note: Data is as on 31st December, 2020 The Zones are defined as per the Zonal Councils RAMPING uP TESTING 1.8 As the first step towards timely identification, prompt isolation & treatment, testing was identified as an effective strategy to limit the spread of infection. A characteristic of the pandemic, which aggravated its virulence, was its probable transmission by asymptomatic people. Large- scale testing was, therefore, imperative for quick identification of cases, immediate isolation to prevent spread and timely treatment. It also helped in effective contact tracing and timely isolation of prospective cases. Testing policy has been continuously evolving since the beginning of the pandemic with countries rapidly gearing up the testing capacity to curb the pace of spread (Figure 7).8 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Figure 7: Ramping up Testing across the World 7(a): As on 15th February, 2020 7(b): As on 15th January, 2021 No testing Policy Limited Testing Testing if symptoms Open public testing Source: WHO Note: \"Open public testing\" is aggressive testing; \"Testing if symptoms\" to testing anyone who shows COVID-19 symptoms; \"Limited testing\" is when an individual is showing symptoms and meets a laid down criterion like medical worker, overseas travel etc. \"No policy\" refers to having no testing policy in place. 1.9 An analysis of tests per lakh and total cases per lakh shows that countries such as United Kingdom, Argentina, Germany, Colombia, Switzerland, Poland and Peru need to perform more tests as cases per lakh are on the higher side relative to tests conducted (Figure 8). US is an outlier as it has both high tests per lakh and high caseload per lakh as on 31st December, 2020. India lies below the global average of cases, despite being the second worst affected country in the world. Figure 8: Total Tests vs Confirmed Cases per Lakh Source: WHO Note: Data is as on 31st December 2020 1.10 India rapidly ramped up its capacity to rapidly scale-up tests. In January 2020, India had only one laboratory testing for COVID-19, at the National Institute of Virology, Pune. Today 9 State of the Economy 2020-21: A Macro View there are more than 2300 laboratories across the country, performing molecular tests for its diagnosis - an unparalleled achievement in the history of the Indian health system. India has shown tremendous progress in conduct of daily tests with a dedicated emphasis on expansion of testing infrastructure (Figure 9). Keeping the focus on \"Test, Track and Treat\", India has tested nearly 18.5 crore cumulative COVID-19 samples with cumulative test positivity rate at 5.6 per cent, as on 31 st December, 2020.

Given the unavailability of a potent cure and a preventive vaccine, it was imperative that the spread be contained by implementing various public health measures. However, this presented crucial policy dilemmas before governments across the globe. POLICY DILEMMAS UNDERLYING COVID-19 'Lives Vs Livelihoods' 1.12 Given the fast spread of the pandemic, the immediate public health policy priority was, 'flattening the epidemiological curve' to mitigate the impact of the spread (refer to Box 1 in Chapter 1, V olume-I, Economic Survey, 2020-21). The steps to \"flatten the curve\" were intended to slow the transmission of the virus, push the peak of the curve and spread the distribution of cases over time. Countries, accordingly, across the globe adopted various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) like social distancing measures via work & school closures, travel bans, cancellations of public events and restrictions of internal movement and, by social isolation measures via quarantining infected people from the population, tracing infected persons contacts and enhanced testing. The containment measures allowed ramping up of the health and testing infrastructure, arresting the spread of the virus and saving 'lives'. Chapter 1, V olume I of the Survey delineates that countries that imposed effective NPIs, especially at the onset of the pandemic, could manage the spread of the pandemic relatively better. 1.13 Even if no containment measures were implemented, a recession would have been 10 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 fuelled by the precautionary and/or panic behaviour of households and firms faced with the uncertainty of dealing with a pandemic that had no cure. This is because households voluntarily took precautions which affected demand, especially for non-essential items. The lockdown reinforced this response to the pandemic. The public health measures, adopted to contain the spread, engendered sizeable immediate economic costs as they led to almost full suspension of economic activity, curbed consumption and investment, as well as restricted labor supply and production. COVID-19, therefore led the world to the predicament of saving 'lives' or 'livelihoods' as the steps taken to flatten the infection curve, steepened the macroeconomic recession curve (Figure 10). Figure 10: Trade-off between Flattening COVID-19 Infection Curve and Steepening of Recession Curve Source: Adapted from Gourinchas, P-O (2020) Demand-side and Supply-side Shocks 1.14 The pandemic has been a unique economic shock that has triggered both supply and demand side shocks simultaneously across economies around the world (Figure 11). Increased uncertainty, lower confidence, loss of incomes, weaker growth prospects, fear of contagion, curtailment of spending options due to closure of all contact-sensitive activities, the triggering of precautionary savings, risk aversion among businesses and resultant fall in consumption and investment - leading to the first order demand shock. The supply chain disruptions caused by closure of economic activity and restricted movement of labour lead to the first order supply shocks. 11 State of the Economy 2020-21: A Macro View Figure 11: Twin Economic Shocks by the Pandemic Supply ShockDisruption in Supply Chain LinkagesLabour Supply Shock -Inability to work from home in non- essential industries Source: Adapted from Estupinan, and Gupta, Sargam and Birla, Bharti (2020) 1.15 The first order supply side disruptions potentially created second round effects on both demand and supply . The initial supply shock, resulting in wage and income loss, could impact aggregate demand and impair productive capacity leading to supply shocks. These effects were further amplified through international trade and financial linkages, dampening global activity and pushing commodity prices down. The feedback loops of demand and supply generated potential hysteresis effects - when households demand less, firms get reduced revenues, which feeds into reduced activity by firms, and thus reduced household income. 1.16 The policies to 'flatten the epidemiological curve', therefore, needed to be accompanied by economic policies designed and targeted to mitigate the resulting shock to the economic system and 'flatten the recession curve'. There was, however, unprecedented uncertainty about the potential spread of the pandemic. The pandemic, therefore, posed unprecedented dilemmas before policymakers - lives vs livelihoods and flattening the twin curves of pandemic and the resultant economic recession. BOX 1: SECTORAL IMPACT OF COVID-19 IN INDIA: UBIQUITOUS, YET IRREGULAR The spread and intensity of COVID-19 induced twin economic shock can be broadly captured through impact on output/Gross Value Added (GV A) and employment. In terms of GV A shock, non-essential activities are likely to endure a combined shock directly proportional to their respective GV A contribution, given that they could not operate during lockdown. Essential activities are likely to undergo a dampened shock, primarily arising from the indirect impact of restricted activities in non-essential sectors. In terms of employment shock, contact-sensitive sectors like trade, hotels, transport, tourism, etc. are likely to undergo a shock proportional to the respective employment share, with informal workers likely to bear the larger brunt (Figure B1) 1. The construction and mining sectors, that employ a larger share of informal workers, have been severely affected by the pandemic-induced lockdowns. 1 Percentage distribution of usually working persons in usual status (ps+ss) by broad status in employment for each industry of work.12 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Figure B1: Sectoral Distribution by GV A Share and Share of Casual Workers Source: MoSPI, PLFS 2018-19 The impact of the pandemic and associated health measures has been unique as it has affected every sector of the economy. Agriculture was largely insulated from the lockdown in India as timely and proactive exemptions from COVID-induced lockdowns to the sector facilitated uninterrupted harvesting of rabi crops and sowing of kharif crops. However, supply chain disruptions impacted the flow of agricultural goods leading to high food inflation and adverse initial impact on some major agricultural exports. The manufacturing sector was hit hard in the first quarter but has since picked up though mining still remains impacted. Construction and Services sector were hit the hardest due to the pandemic induced requirements of social distancing and minimising of personal interaction.

Since 2018, the growth momentum in global output was on a weakened footing owing to various factors like trade tensions, political instability, slowed demand and reduction in industrial activity. COVID-19 pandemic accentuated the deceleration by causing severe demand and supply disruptions. Economic activity has been belaboured by reduced mobility, owing both to official restrictions and private decisions; uncertainty regarding the post-pandemic economic prospects and policies has impacted investment; disruptions in education have decelerated human capital accumulation; concerns about the viability of global value chains; and the adverse impact on international trade and tourism. 1.18 The month of April 2020 became the month of \"Global Lockdown\" with world economic activity coming to a standstill - leading to a steep fall in output during second quarter of 2020. 18 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Global output is expected to witness the sharpest contraction in a century, contracting in the range of 3.5 - 4.3 per cent in 2020 as per the estimates provided by IMF and World Bank (Figure 12). The cumulative loss to global GDP over 2020 and 2021 is estimated at around USD 9 trillion - greater than the economies of Japan and Germany combined. Loss of output is anticipated to be more severe in AEs at 5.4 per cent compared to EMDEs, excluding China, which stood at 5.0 per cent for the year 2020 (Figure 12). This is aligned with the more severe impact of the pandemic spread in AEs than EMDEs as was seen above. The estimates for global growth were revised upward through the year with easing of lockdowns and resurgence in economic activity in July-September quarter of the year. The rebound in global activity has, however, been uneven and subdued since the beginning of second half of the year due to resurgence in COVID-19 infection rates in AEs. Figure 12: Trend in Global Growth -10-5051015 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020E 2021FReal GDPgrowth rate (in %) World AEs Euro area EMDE India Source: IMF Note: E is Estimate, F is Forecast 1.19 The pandemic induced border closures and supply disruptions interrupted the international provision of goods and services. The Global composite Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) was in contraction for five months before July, 2020 (Figure 13). Global trade is projected to contract by 9.2 per cent in 2020\u2014comparable to the decline during the 2009 global recession but affecting a markedly larger share of economies (Figure 14). Trade has, however, played a critical role in responding to the pandemic, allowing countries to secure access to vital food and medical supplies. 1.20 Most commodity prices rebounded from their mid-2020 lows as strict lockdowns were gradually lifted and demand firmed, especially from China (Figure 15). The recovery in oil prices was more modest amid concerns over the pandemic's lasting impact on oil demand. Gold emerged as a safe-haven investment in the backdrop of the pandemic prices with prices increasing by 26.2 per cent in November, 2020 as compared to December, 2019. Food prices also surged during the year reflecting supply chain disruptions. As a result of weak demand and subdued energy prices, inflation moderated in most part of the world, deflationary pressure emerged in major AEs. Fall in inflation in EMDEs was less broad based than in AEs, reflecting the effects of sharp currency depreciations as well as rising domestic food prices in some countries (Figure 16). 19 State of the Economy 2020-21: A Macro View Figure 13: Global PMI Figure 14: World Merchandise Trade 1 Trade Volume Trend (2011-2018) Source: IHS Source: WTO Note: World Trade in 2015 Indexed at 100 Figure 15: Commodity Prices Figure 16: Inflation Dynamics Source: IMF Note: * Data till November 2020Source: WEO October 2020 database, IMF 1.21 Global financial conditions have remained accommodative on the back of continued policy support via unprecedented swift interventions by Central banks (Figure 17). Despite subdued activity and a highly uncertain outlook, global equity markets have rebounded at a faster pace from the March lows, though with notable differentiation across countries, depending on the spread of the virus, the scope of policy support, and sectoral composition. Behind the broad rebound of risky assets, there are clear signs of differentiation across sectors. Some sectors (such as airlines, hotels, energy, and financials) have been more affected by the lockdown and social distancing, whereas those that are less contact-intensive (information technology, communications) have fared better. US dollar index has weakened by 7.4 per cent on year-to- date basis in comparison to most G-10 currencies with countries adopting various policies to alleviate downward pressure on their exchange rates (Figure 18). 20 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Figure 17: Global Financial Conditions Figure 18: Weakened uS Dollar -2-10123456 01/12/2007 01/10/200801/08/200901/06/201001/04/201101/02/201201/12/201201/10/201301/08/201401/06/201501/04/201601/02/201701/12/201701/10/201801/08/201901/06/2020Financial Condition IndexUnited States Note: Graph depicts Standard Deviation from mean of the Index - a lower value indicates accommodative stanceSource: Thomson ReutersNote: US Dollar Index is a measure of the value of the USD against a weighted basket of currencies used by US trade partners 1.22 The pandemic has exacerbated the risks associate d with a decade-long wave of global debt accumulation. Sizeable discretionary support, along with a sharp contraction in output and an ensuing fall in revenues has led to a surge in government debt and deficits. Debt burdens have increased as corporates faced a period of sharply reduced sales and sovereigns have financed large stimulus packages. Debt levels have reached historic highs, making the global economy particularly vulnerable to financial market stress (Figure 19). General government debt in major economies rose during Q2 2020 (Figure 20). Debt is likely to rise further as governments finance the recovery by facilitating the transition of capital, labor, skills, and innovation to a post-pandemic economic environment. Figure 19: Government Debt as % of GDP Figure 20: Major Economies - Total Debt as per cent of GDP Source: World Bank, Data for 2020 is Estimates Source: OECD 1.23 Going forward, an ef fective vaccination campaign, restoration of consumer and business confidence as well as continued monetary and fiscal support are expected to lift the global output by 4.5 - 5.5 per cent in 2021. Downside risks to this forecast include the possibility of mutant strains, delays in vaccine procurement and distribution, disruptive effects on potential output from the pandemic, and financial stress triggered by high debt levels and weak growth. 21 State of the Economy 2020-21: A Macro View INDIAN ECONOMY ON THE PATH OF A RESILIENT V-SHAPED TRAJECTORY 1.24 The Indian economy, after subdued growth in 2019, had begun to regain momentum January 2020 onwards, only to be stalled by the once-in-a-century black swan COVID-19 outbreak. The economy witnessed a sharp contraction of 23.9 per cent in Q1: FY 2020-21 and 7.5 per cent in Q2: FY 2020-21 due to the stringent lockdown imposed during March-April, 2020. Since then, several high frequency indicators have demonstrated a V-shaped recovery. The fundamentals of the economy remain strong as gradual scaling back of lockdowns along with the astute support of Atmanirbhar Bharat Mission have placed the economy firmly on the path of revival. 1.25 There has been rapid recovery in India's economic activity from the COVID-19 pandemic induced unprecedented lows of the first quarter of FY 2020-21 on the back of extraordinary fiscal and monetary support provided by the Government and RBI. Overall movement of high frequency indicators over Q1, Q2 and Q3 indicated speedy pickup in Q2 and growing convergence to pre-pandemic levels in Q3 (Figure 21). As India's mobility and pandemic trends aligned and improved concomitantly, indicators like E-way bills, rail freight, GST collections and power consumption not only reached pre-pandemic levels but also surpassed previous year levels. Figure 21: Movement of High Frequency Indicators Source: Compiled from various sources Note: Red colour indicates negative YoY and QoQ growth; Brown colour indicates positive YoY or QoQ growth and Green colour indicates positive YoY and QoQ growth. For indicators like CPI and G-Sec yield decline is considered as positive, i.e., green and vice versa.22 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Sectoral Trends 1.26 The year also saw manufacturing sector' s resilience, rural demand cushioning overall economic activity and structural consumption shifts in booming digital transactions. The full impact of the pandemic on the Indian economy is still unravelling and the future growth prospects would critically depend on sustenance of momentum of this recovery. Agriculture is set to cushion the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Indian economy in 2020-21 with a growth of 3.4 per cent in both Q1 and Q2. It is the only sector that has contributed positively to the overall Gross Value Added (GV A) in both Q1 and Q2 2020-21. This indicates that agricultural activities for rabi harvesting and kharif sowing were largely unaffected by the COVID 19-induced lockdown. Given the expectation of a bountiful kharif harvest, the food grain production target has been set at 301 million tonnes for the 2020-21 crop year, up by 1.5 per cent from the record output achieved in 2019-20 (Figure 22). Sowing remained healthy while procurement continued unabated, firming up buffers and channelizing supply, while ensuring food security throughout the year (Figures 23). Figure 22: Foodgrain Production in India Figure 23: Procurement of Rice Agriculture, Department of Food and Public Distribution Note: Production figures for 2020-21 are estimates. Procurement of Rice is as on 15 January 2021.The target for procurement of rice for 2020-21 is 495.37 lakh tonnes 1.27 Rural demand has remained resilient empowered by the government's thrust on the rural economy and infrastructure in previous years, through a bouquet of reforms for both farm and non-farm sectors. There has been re-energised focus in the last six years on rural roads by extension to smaller villages, rural housing and sanitation, provision of basic amenities under various Government Schemes and creation of durable assets through MGNREGS. These measures have been reinforced by rural digitalisation and financial inclusion drives which also aided in smooth implementation of demand push measures during COVID-19. Initiatives to spur skill development, entrepreneurship, Self Help Groups and livelihoods have further empowered the rural economy to combat the COVID-19 induced vagaries. Critical steps such as PM-KISAN, adoption of cost plus 50 per cent formula for MSP, focus on 23 State of the Economy 2020-21: A Macro View irrigation via PM Krishi Sinchai Yojana, micro-irrigation scheme, promoting economies of scale through FPOs, and institutionalizing e-NAM (Electronic national agricultural market), and promotion of agricultural mechanization through subsidies and custom hiring centres, have contributed to nourishing a vibrant agricultural sector, which remains a silver lining to India's growth story of FY 2020-21. 1.28 A palpable V-shaped recovery in industrial production was observed over the year. Manufacturing rebounded and industrial value started to normalize. Headwinds, however, lingered on. The index of eight core industries, which make up around 40 per cent of the index, registered a growth of (-) 2.6 per cent in November, 2020 as compared to a growth of 0.7 per cent in November, 2019 and (-) 0.9 per cent in October, 2020 (Figure 24). Consequently, IIP, after registering positive growth in October 2020 slipped back into contractionary zone in November, 2020 (Figure 25). PMI Manufacturing, however, continued to remain in expansionary zone in December 2020. Resuscitating steel consumption reinforced acceleration in construction sector, propping up employment as economy unlocked. The housing market, a key forward linkage sector for steel consumption, saw gradual resurgence from its Q1: 2020-21 trough. Electricity sector retained its momentum with power consumption registering positive YoY growth since September, 2020. Figure 24: Growth in Core Index Figure 25: Growth tural Gas Petroleum Ref. Prod ucts Fertilizers Ste el Cement Electricity Overall Revitalized inter and intra-state movement along with a sustained spurt in industrial and commercial activity heralded the economy' s returning to normalcy. E-way bills, electronic toll collection, rail freight and port cargo traffic not just recovered but surpassed previous year levels in Q3: 2020-21, while rail passenger earnings and domestic aviation witnessed a steady recovery (Figures 26 and 27). Indian services sector sustained its recovery from the pandemic driven declines with PMI Services output and new business rising for the third straight month in December. 24 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Figure 26: Average Daily centIntra S tat e tra de Inter S tat e tra de Total E-Way Bill s ge nerat ed Source: Ministry of Road, Transport and Highways; GSTN BOX 2: E-WAY BILLS E-way bills are a strong leading indicator of revenue collections, supply chain corrections and logistics growth. With industries at a standstill during lockdown in the fight against COVID-19, total e-way bills generated witnessed a sharp contraction of 74 per cent (YoY) in April 2020. V olume of inter State and intra State trade plunged by 89 per cent and 80 per cent respectively in April 2020 compared to previous year levels. While E-way bills for all distance categories contracted sharply in April 2020, E-way bills with distance more than 1000 km saw the maximum fall (Figure B3 ). Value of e-way bills per person saw a similar fall (Figure B4 ). Figure B3: Volume of E-Way Bill by Distance CategoryFigure B4: All India- Value of Goods Traded (INR Per Person) Source: GSTN With gradual relaxation of restrictions, E-way bills in terms of total assessable value generated and value generated per person regained momentum and persistently improved to surpass previous year levels in September 2020 (Figure B5).

Figure B5: All India- Value of Goods Traded Per Person Source: Data from GSTN curated from public platform Indiapulse@ISB Persistent improvement in E-way bills generated bodes well for faster economic recovery. A regression analysis using pair-wise state trade data estimates that inter-state trade had a 36-39 per cent fall on average during the lockdown and fully recovered in September 2020. The analysis shows that inter-state borders had some effect on trade, but not very large. Interstate borders might have been an impediment during the initial phase of lockdown but not in the later period. 26 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 log (trade) ij,t = a + b1 * log(distance) + b2 * D (Border) + b3 * D (COVID) t + e ij,t Log (Pairwise inter-state trade) (1) (2) Dummy variable which takes the value 1 if the pair of States shares borders The V-shaped recovery in revenue collections was quite quick in states (Figure B6) such as Telangana and Andhra Pradesh with value of E-way bills per person reaching previous year levels in June. On the other hand, states like Haryana and Gujarat witnessed recovery a month later in July while Maharashtra, a key COVID-19 hotspot and the biggest contributor to India's GDP witnessed a recovery August onwards.

However, inflation in December, 2020 fell back into the RBI's target range of 4 +/- 2 per cent to reach 4.6 per cent year-on-year as compared to 6.9 per cent in November (Figure 28). This was driven by a steep fall in food prices, particularly of vegetables, cereals, and protein products and favourable base effects. After consistently rising for six months since Q1:2020-21, headline inflation also eased sequentially in December. However, fuel inflation remained sticky owing to higher crude oil prices. Core inflation remained elevated on a yearly basis but eased as compared to the previous month. Figure Inflation Source: MOSPI28 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 1.31 Bank credit remained subdued in FY 2020-21 amid risk aversion and muted credit appetite (Figure 29). The profile of wholesale bank credit during April-November 2020 reflected this trend across both public sector and private sector banks. While overall bank credit growth and credit to commercial sector gradually picked up from its April lows to reach 6.7 per cent and 6.2 per cent YoY respectively as on 1 st January, it remained sluggish compared to previous year levels. Credit growth to agriculture and allied activities accelerated to 7.4 per cent in October 2020 from 7.1 per cent in October 2019. October 2020 saw resilient credit flows to sectors such as construction, trade and hospitality, while bank credit remained muted to the manufacturing sector. Credit growth to the services sector accelerated to 9.5 per cent in October 2020 from 6.5 per cent in October 2019. While personal loans registered a decelerated growth of 9.3 per cent in October 2020 as compared with 17.2 per cent growth a year ago, vehicle loans continued to perform well, registering accelerated growth of 8.4 per cent in October 2020 vis-a-vis a growth of 5.0 per cent in October 2019. Figure 29: Growth in Wholesale Bank Sep-20 Nov-20*YoY growth ( Per cent )Public Sector Banks Private Banks All Scheduled Commercial Banks Source: RBI Note: * Growth over September 2020 1.32 On the non-bank financing side, assets under management (AUM) of mutual funds grew at 17.73 per cent during April to November 2020. These funds faced aggressive redemption pressures during the first quarter of the year amid liquidity crunch in debt markets. However, RBI's special liquidity window for mutual funds helped them to tide over this difficult period. RBI's liquidity enhancing measures also boosted Commercial Paper (CP) issuances and eased spreads. In December 2020, CP issuances rose by 55 per cent to reach `1.88 lakh crore as compared to ` 1.21 lakh crore in November 2020. The effective Weighted Average Yield of CPs continued to ease to reach 3.6 per cent in December 2020. The mutual fund holdings of NBFCs, after declining substantially post the IL&FS episode, increased by around 40 per cent in November 2020 from its March 2020 levels. 1.33 The fiscal arithmetic was impacted by the adverse impact on government revenues and 29 State of the Economy 2020-21: A Macro View elevated expenditures, as the Government enhanced spending during the unlock phase. During April-December 2020 (Flash estimates), total non-debt receipts of Central Government fell by 4.7 per cent YoY . However, gross GST collections (Centre plus states) gained buoyancy October onwards, crossing the ` 1 lakh crore mark consecutively for 3 months, thereby providing much needed succour to the Government' s revenue position (Figure 30). However, on the states' front, total receipts of state governments during April-October 2020, contracted by 13.7 per cent. Total expenditure of the Central Government recorded a growth of 11 per cent during April-December 2020 (Flash estimates), with capital expenditure growing by 24.1 per cent and revenue expenditure by 9.2 per cent year-on-year. States, however, witnessed a contraction in total expenditure by 4.1 per cent year-on-year during April-October 2020. While revenue expenditure of states did not see any significant uptick during this period, growth in capital expenditure of state governments emerged out of eight months of consecutive decline to record positive growth in October 2020. Figure 30: Trends in GST Collection during 1.00 1.020.98 0.920.951.03 1.03 Oct Nov DecRs Lakh crore2020-21 2019-20 Source: Department of Revenue 1.34 The pandemic led receipts-expenditure wedge witnessed in this year has been bridged mainly through additional market borrowing, as demonstrated in the revised borrowing calendar announced by the Centre and higher market borrowing limits given to states. As on 8th January 2021, the Central Government gross market borrowing for FY2020-21 reached ` 10.72 lakh crore, while State Governments have raised ` 5.71 lakh crore. While Centre's borrowings are 65 per cent higher than the amount raised in the corresponding period of the previous year, state governments have seen a step up of 41 per cent (Figure 31). Since the COVID-19 outbreak depressed growth and revenues, a significant scale up of borrowings amply demonstrates the government's commitment to provide sustained fiscal stimulus by maintaining high public expenditure levels in the economy. 30 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Figure 31: Gross Market Borrowings by States and 1.35 Government and RBI led liquidity support measures, increase in limits of ways and means advances, and relaxation of rules governing withdrawals from the Consolidated Sinking Fund (CSF) enabled bond markets to absorb pressures of increased government borrowings and added to their buoyancy. The surplus systemic liquidity continues to ensure softening of 10-year G-sec yield and reduction of spread with AAA corporate bond yields (Figure 32). The average spread of AAA rated 3-year corporate bond fell from 171 bps in May 2020 to 22 bps in December 2020. The spreads on AA rated corporate bonds also moderated significantly during the same period i.e., by 131 bps (from 243 bps to 113 bps) and 60 bps (from 177 bps to 117 bps) each for 3-year and 5- year bonds respectively. 1.36 The external sector provided an effective cushion to India during these uncertain times. Amid domestic and global demand and supply disruptions, India's merchandise exports fell by 21.1 per cent in the first half of 2020-21 with the contraction being more severe for imports at 38.8 per cent. Exports, however, revived gradually as the rate of contraction eased to 5.0 per cent in Q3:2020-21, with non-oil exports increasing by 2.3 per cent during the quarter. With the gradual unlocking of the economy, the decline in imports has also moderated to 8.3 per cent during Q3: 2020-21. While trade deficit narrowed to US$ 26.2 billion in April-September 2020-21 from US$ 88.9 billion a year ago, it stood at US$ 31.2 billion during the third quarter of the year, lower than US$ 37.0 billion in the same quarter last year. India recorded a current account surplus of 3.1 per cent of GDP in the first half of the year largely supported by strong services exports (Figure 33). While prospects of external demand normalization are underway, its pace is contingent on the global COVID-19 outlook and successful rollout of vaccinations across the world.31 State of the Economy 2020-21: A Macro View Figure 33: Composition of India's Current Account Balance Source: RBI 1.37 India remained a preferred investment destination in FY 2020-21. FDI poured in amidst global asset shifts towards equities and prospects of quicker recovery in emerging economies. Subsequent to an unrivalled global portfolio investor selloff in March 2020, surges of FPI flows were witnessed June onwards marking a renewed appetite for risky assets and yield, and weakening of US dollar amid global monetary easing and fiscal stimulus packages. Net FPI inflows recorded an all-time monthly high of US$ 9.8 billion in November 2020. During April-December 2020, equities witnessed inflow of at USD 30.0 billion, five times its previous year value - India was the only country among emerging markets to receive equity FII inflows in 2020 (Figure 34). As a result of these inflows, buoyant Sensex and NIFTY resulted in India's market-capitalisation to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratio crossing 100 per cent for the first time since October 2010. While stock markets value the potential future growth, these elevated levels still raise concerns on the disconnect between the financial markets and real sector . Figure 34: Equity Inflows from FIIs into India in 2020 Source: Institute of International Finance.32 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 1.38 Robust capital inflows along with a weak dollar lent an appreciating bias to the Indian rupee since end June 2020. However, RBI's prudent interventions in the foreign exchange market limited the appreciation (Figure 35). Combined with a rise in gold reserves and foreign currency assets, India's foreign exchange reserves climbed to a new high of US$ 586.08 billion as on 8 th January, 2020, covering more than 18 months of imports. External debt as a ratio to GDP, which is comprised primarily of private sector's external debt, rose marginally to 21.6 per cent as at end-September 2020 from 20.6 per cent at end-March 2020. However, the ratio of foreign exchange reserves to total and short-term debt (original and residual) improved because of the sizable accretion in reserves (Figure 36). Reflecting lower current receipts, debt service ratio (principal repayment plus interest payment), however, increased to 9.7 per cent as at end-September 2020 as compared to 6.5 per cent at end-March 2020. Figure 35: Movements in Rupee cent Debt Service Ratio Exte rnal Debt to GDP Ratio of Short-term debt to reserves Source: RBI 1.39 Overall, India is well on its path to a V -shaped recovery to pre-pandemic levels and beyond. The economy was well supported by strategically paced macro-economic policies and resilient fundamentals. The coordinated policy response on both health and economic fronts helped India to endure the pandemic-induced shocks this year. BOX 3: COVID-19's Impact on GV A, Labour Markets and Fiscal Position: A Geographical Perspective The geographical spread of the COVID-19 health shock is intertwined with the pre-existing economic fragilities of the states. This fragility can be interpreted on three fronts- relative sectoral shares in GV A, labour market and fiscal position. The highest output contributing state and the COVID-19 epicentre of the country i.e., Maharashtra has grappled with contact-sensitive services sector shock (with 56 per cent of its output coming from that sector) and labour market stresses given its higher percentage share of MSMEs. While Tamil Nadu and Kerala are most fragile to the construction sector shock, a manufacturing slowdown lends risks to Gujarat's and Jammu and Kashmir's economic recovery. Punjab, though sheltered by the relatively resilient agricultural sector, is expected to experience informal labour shocks in the services sector. Services led informal sector shocks also make states like Delhi and 33 State of the Economy 2020-21: A Macro View Telangana vulnerable. However, the comfortable fiscal situation of Delhi, one of the key COVID-19 hotspots, offers cushion to battle the health shock. The ubiquity of construction led informal sector shocks impacts Uttar Pradesh, a leading economy and most populous state of the country.

POLICY RESPONSE TO COVID-19 Global 1.40 To help mitigate the spread of the virus, many countries implemented necessary measures. These have included school closures, restrictions on nonessential business activities, prohibitions of public gatherings, suspension of public transport, restrictions on movement, border closures, and travel bans. These social distancing measures with public information campaigns, broad-based testing, and contact tracing of individuals who were potentially exposed to known cases. Lockdowns and travel restrictions imposed significant supply-side constraints on national economies, drastically reducing output and employment in sectors that are usually resistant to business cycle fluctuations, particularly non-traded services. 1.41 The unrivalled impact of the pandemic on almost every sector of the global economy and every aspect of society invoked a similar unparalleled policy response. Governments and Central 35 State of the Economy 2020-21: A Macro View Banks, the world over, have deployed various measures to stimulate the economy through liquidity support and regulatory changes. An unprecedented fiscal response at $11.7 trillion globally, or close to 12 per cent of global GDP (as of September 11, 2020), has provided lifelines to vulnerable households and firms. These measures include additional spending or forgone revenue, temporary tax cuts, cash and in-kind transfers, unemployment benefits, wage subsidies, and liquidity support, including loans, guarantees, and equity injections by the public sector (Figure 37). Figure 37: Types of Fiscal Support across the Globe Source: IMF EMMIEs = Emerging Market and Middle-Income Economies; G20 = Group of Twenty; LIDCs = Low-Income Developing Countries 1.42 Monetary authorities across the world have eased monetary conditions with broad-based cuts in short-term policy rates and reserve requirements to support activity and provided emergency liquidity support to stabilize financial markets (Figure 38). Several central banks around the world engaged in unconventional monetary policy interventions in the form of long-term asset purchase programs (for the first time in many EMDEs), relending facilities, relaxation in asset provisioning requirements and supporting credit provision to a wide range of borrowers. The corresponding injections of reserve money into the banking system have been effective in stabilizing bond markets, reducing bond yields, boost equity prices without putting pressure on exchange rates. Figure 38: Trend in Global Policy 2020-21 V olume 2 1.43 The deep economic contractions across many countries and heightened uncertainties about the post pandemic global economic landscape, however, may set back long-term growth prospects. India's Strategic Multi-Pronged Policy Response 1.44 India recognised the disruptive impact of the pandemic and charted its own unique path amidst dismal projections of the spread in the country given its huge population. It was estimated that India would have 30 crore cases and several thousand deaths by the end of May, 2020 (Klein et al., 2020). At a time of rapid change and mounting uncertainty, the clear objective of 'Jaan Hai to Jahan hai' and to 'break the chain of spread' helped the government face the dilemma of 'lives vs livelihood', pace the sequence of policy interventions and adapt its response as per the evolving situation. India adopted a graded four-pronged pre-emptive, and pro-active strategy consisting of (i) containment measures, (ii) calibrated fiscal support focussed on essentials during lockdown and demand push during the unlock phase, (iii) financial measures and (iv) structural reforms to combat COVID-19 (also refer to Chapter 1, V olume I, Economic Survey, 2020-21). The policy response was tailored to different phases of the epidemic, adapting to evolving requirements to provide succour to people, support demand, facilitate the recovery to pre-pandemic levels and ensure fiscal and debt sustainability. A gradual, smooth transition was paved from 'Jaan Hai to Jahan hai' to 'Jaan bhi aur Jahan bhi'. 1.45 A nationwide 'stringent' lockdown for 21 days was declared on March 24, 2020 and subsequently extended till May 31, 2020. As per the Oxford Government Response Tracker, India was among the first ones to impose a stringent lockdown (with index at 100) despite having a few cases at the time of imposing a lockdown. The lockdown provided the much-needed time to strengthen the health system response, ramp up testing and ensure public engagement/awareness towards practice of social distancing. At the beginning of the pandemic, India was almost totally dependent on imported Ventilators, PPE Kits and N-95 Masks. The Central Government recognised the challenges posed by the pandemic in the very initial stages and successfully ensured more than adequate availability and supplies of essential medical items across the country. A three-tier arrangement of health facilities was created for appropriate management of COVID-19 cases, (i) COVID Care Center with isolation beds for mild or pre-symptomatic cases; (ii) Dedicated COVID Health Centre (DCHC) with oxygen supported isolation beds for moderate cases and (iii) Dedicated COVID Hospital (DCH) with ICU beds for severe cases has been implemented. As on 29th December 2020 a total of 2,70,710 oxygen supported isolation beds, 81,113 ICU beds (including 40,627 ventilator beds) and 12,669 quarantine centres with 5,91,496 beds had been created. The textile industry rose to the challenge of the pandemic by up-scaling the production of PPE kits and N95 masks from scratch to emerge as the second largest producer of PPE kits and reach a daily production of 32 lakh pieces of N95 masks. 1.46 Government of India and the RBI have undertaken multidimensional efforts to maintain financial stability and provide necessary regulatory support to ease both demand and supply constraints posed by the pandemic. The policy support provided helped in cushioning the expected fall in demand due to the lockdown-induced distress on both individuals and firms. The fiscal policy response of the Government of India to the pandemic was distinct from other countries in that the demand stimulus was introduced in a phased manner with prior focus on measures to provide a cushion for the poor and vulnerable sections of society and to the business 37 State of the Economy 2020-21: A Macro View sector (especially the MSMEs). This included one of the world's largest foodgrains distribution programme, direct cash transfers to 42 crore individuals, more than 20 crore Women Jan Dhan accounts, cash support to building and construction workers, `30,000 crore additional emergency working capital funding for farmers through NABARD, additional pension payments, provision for free gas cylinders, additional allocation under MGNREGS, as well as government guarantees for credit, postponement of financial deadlines etc. The pace at which India could intervene on technology related transfers of financial assistance to the poor and vulnerable during the pandemic derives its success from the meticulously built social institution of J-A-M (JanDhan, Aadhar and Mobile). Through the Direct Benefit Transfer system, the country could transfer money in crores of accounts through a click of button during the pandemic time. Further, Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan (GKRA) was launched on 20th June, 2020 for a period of 125 days in 116 districts of 6 States to boost employment and livelihood opportunities for migrant workers who had returned to their villages and similarly affected citizens in rural areas due to COVID-19 pandemic. Government of India also launched Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS 1.0) to provide much needed relief to stressed sectors by helping entities sustain employment and meet liabilities. A second version of the Scheme (ECLGS 2.0) was also launched to offer necessary credit guarantee for loans by banks and NBFCs to identified stressed sectors. 1.47 RBI undertook several conventional and unconventional liquidity enhancing measures to manage liquidity situation in the economy. These measures, inter alia, included injection of durable liquidity of more than `2.7 lakh crore through Open Market Operation (OMO) purchases between February 6-December 4, 2020, `20,000 crore through two purchase auction OMOs in State Development Loans (SDLs), `1 lakh crore via Targeted Long Term Repo Operations (TLTROs) of up to three years' tenor, `1.25 lakh crore through Long Term Repo Operations (LTROs) conducted in February-March 2020, reduction in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) requirement of banks from 4 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) to 3 per cent with effect from March 28, 2020 augmenting primary liquidity in the banking system by about `1.37 lakh crore, raising banks' limit for borrowing overnight under the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF), `50,000 crore Special Liquidity Facility for mutual funds and refinance facility worth `75,000 crore for all India financial institutions i.e., NABARD, NHB, SIDBI and EXIM Bank. A key measure taken by RBI and Government of India during H1:2020-21 to ameliorate the liquidity constraints faced by NBFCs, was to set up a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to purchase short-term papers from eligible NBFCs/HFCs, which could then utilise the proceeds to extinguish their existing liabilities. 1.48 To ameliorate corporate stress, Government suspended the initiation of fresh insolvency proceedings under Section 7, 9 and 10 of Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code 2016 for defaults arising on or after 25th March 2020 till 25th March 2021. RBI, too, announced loan moratorium from 1st March 2020 to 31st August 2020 along with an asset classification dispensation and special resolution framework for COVID-19 related stressed assets. Under the resolution plans that could be invoked under the above window, lenders were permitted to grant additional moratorium of up to two years. Also, MSME accounts classified as Standard where the aggregate exposure of banks and NBFCs was `25 crore or below as on March 1, 2020, were permitted to be restructured without a downgrade in the asset classification, subject to certain conditions. 38 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 1.49 India's response has been unique in recognising that the pandemic would have long-term disruptive effects on the productive capacity. The Atmanirbhar Bharat Mission was, accordingly, a composite package announced with welfare measures to address the short-term distress of individuals and firms; and structural reforms to alleviate the long-term distress on the economy. With gradual unlocking of the economy, the focus of the stimulus measures shifted towards investment boosting and consumption revival measures like Production Linked Incentives, enhancing capital expenditure and investments in infrastructure sector. The nuanced adaptations in policy as per the requirements of the pandemic was based on continuous dialogue and coordination between the Centre, States and Local Governments. The overall policy response, therefore, is aimed at making the Indian economy more resilient and flexible to deal with the opportunities and problems of the post-COVID world (Table 1).

Source: Compiled from various sources and covers major policy measures42 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 V-SHAPED E CONOMIC RECOVERY 1.50 India's contraction of 23.9 per cent in Q1: FY 2020-21 and 7.5 per cent in Q2: FY 2020-21 quarter reflect the unparalleled effect of the Covid-19 pandemic and the containment measures that were taken to control the pandemic. The contraction was consistent with the India's enforcement of one of the most stringent lockdowns as reflected in the Government Response Stringency Index measured by Oxford University. The fundamentals of the economy remained strong as gradual scaling back of lockdowns, along with the astute support of Atmanirbhar Bharat Mission has placed the economy firmly on the path of recovery. 1.51 NSO has estimated a contraction of real GDP by 7.7 per cent in 2020-21 as compared to a growth of 4.2 per cent in 2019-20. This is the fourth contraction in India's GDP since 1960-61 (Figure 39). The contraction in 1965-66 and 1971-72 coincided with wars and droughts while the year 1979-80 was associated with a severe drought and political instability. A common factor in all these years was a steep fall in agricultural output. The year 2020-21, on the contrary, has been bestowed with abundant monsoons leading to the agricultural sector emerging as the silver lining of the economy. The contraction this year reflects the 'once in a century crisis' unleashed by the pandemic and associated public health measures. Figure 39: Trend in India's Real GDP Growth Source: NSO 1.52 Government Consumption and Net Exports have cushioned the contraction in GDP while Gross Capital Formation (GCF) and Private Consumption have contributed to the contraction in GDP in 2020-21 (Figure 40). Government final consumption expenditure has sustained the growth of GDP in 2020-21 with its share increasing to 14.0 per cent from 12.0 per cent in 2019-20 (Figure 41). The share of private consumption has almost remained the same indicating the adverse impact of the pandemic and restrained personal consumption in contact-sensitive sectors. Gross Investment has contributed most to the contraction in GDP in 2020-21 with its share in GDP pegged at 26.7 per cent, lowest in the 2000s. Net Exports 43 State of the Economy 2020-21: A Macro View have cushioned the fall in GDP in 2020-21 largely due to a sharper contraction in imports than in exports.

As per quarterly estimates released by NSO, the economy has shown a decline of 15.7 per cent by H1: FY 2020-21. A decline of real GDP by 7.7 per cent for the whole FY:2020-21 indicates a modest decline of 0.1 per cent in GDP growth in second half of the year. It also indicates a 23.9 per cent growth in H2: FY2020-21 over H1: FY2020-21. Faster normalisation of business activities amid gradual lifting of restrictions, higher festive and pent-up demand and policy support is expected to translate into a faster-than-anticipated economic recovery over the second half. This is supported by a strong rebound seen in several high frequency indicators in Q3: FY 2020-21. 1.54 On the demand side, the recovery is expected to be broad-based in the second half (Figure 42). The biggest growth driver is likely to be government consumption that is expected to grow at a strong 17 per cent YoY in second half as against a 3.9 per cent contraction the first half. Private consumption is also expected to improve significantly with a mild contraction of 0.6 per cent as against a contraction of 18.9 per cent in the first half. Investment, as measured by Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF), is also expected to recover significantly with a mild contraction of 0.8 per cent in the second half against a sharp 29 per cent drop in H1FY21. Net Exports (Exports - Imports) turned positive in the first half of the year with a larger contraction in imports of 29.1 per cent as compared to contraction in exports of 10.7 per cent. With gradual recovery of economic activity, both imports and exports have picked up and net exports is expected to re-enter the negative territory in the second half. Exports are expected to decline by 5.8 per cent and imports by 11.3 per cent in the second half of the year. 44 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Figure 42: Half-Yearly Trends in Growth of Components of GDP 42(a): Private Final Consumption Expenditure 42(b):Government in GDP YoY Growth (RHS) 42(c): Gross Fixed Capital cent) Exports Imports Source: NSO 1.55 On the supply side, Gross V alue Added (GV A) growth is pegged at -7.2 per cent in 2020-21 as against 3.9 per cent in 2019-20. Only Agriculture contributed to positive growth while Service and Industry contributed to the contraction in GDP (Figure 43). Agriculture is set to cushion the shock of the C OVID -19 pandemic on the Indian economy in 2020- 21 with a growth of 3.4 per cent - resulting in an increase in its share in GDP to 19.9 per cent in 2020-21 from 17.8 per cent in 2019-20 (Figure 44). This indicates that agricultural activities for rabi harvesting and kharif sowing were largely unaffected by the COVID-induced lockdown. Industry and Services are estimated to contract by 9.6 per cent and 8.8 per cent during the year. Within Industry, Mining is estimated to contract by 12.4 per cent, Manufacturing by 9.4 per cent and construction by 12.6 per cent. The utilities sector has shown a sharp recovery and is set to register a positive growth of 2.7 per cent in 2020-21. Within Services Sector, trade, hotels, transport & communication are estimated to contract by 21.4 per cent.45 State of the Economy 2020-21: A Macro View Figure 43: Sectoral Contribution to Overall GV A GrowthFigure 44: centAgri Industry Servic es Growth of Real GVA18 18 18 18 17 18 2030 30 29 29 29 27 2652 52 53 53 54 55 54 0102030405060708090100 2014-15 2015-162016-172017-182018-192019-202020-21Per centAgri Industry Services Source: NSO 1.56 A positive growth in value addition of most of the sectors in second half is an encouraging sign for the economy (Figure 45). This translates into a modest 0.3 per cent growth in the second half as against a 14.9 per cent contraction in first half of 2020-21. Agriculture sector growth is pegged at a steady 3.4 per cent in both the halves of 2020-21. Industry sector has staged a robust recovery in second half with a positive growth of 1.1 per cent as against a sharp 20.5 per cent drop in the first half with a sharp pick up in manufacturing sector to 0.5 per cent in second half against a contraction of 19.4 per cent in first half. Electricity and Construction sectors are also estimated to register V-shaped recovery with growth of 7.1 per cent and 4.4 per cent respectively in the second half. The major brunt of the pandemic has been borne by the contact-sensitive services sector, which contracted by 15.5 per cent in first half and are estimated to contract by 1.1 per cent in second half. Trade, Hotels, Transport & Communication, constituting one-third of overall services, contracted by 31.5 per cent in first half and are estimated to contract by 12.0 per cent in second half.

With gradual unlocking and able support of macro-economic policies, the economy has steadily rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. Data on high-frequency indicators suggest growing convergence with previous year's activity levels. The sharp contraction of the economy in first half of the year is expected to be covered by broad-based resurgent growth in second half of the year. 1.58 Lockdowns and other restrictions needed to address the public health crisis, together with spontaneous reductions in economic activity by many consumers and producers, have constituted an unprecedented combination of adverse shocks to global economic activity. Beyond its short-term impact, deep recessions triggered by the pandemic have a risk of leading to hysteresis. While the several seminal reforms will help in reducing the possibility of hysteresis, the recovery would be regarded as having avoided hysteresis when the economy regains the pre-COVID output path and is back on its trajectory of potential growth (assuming no COVID). 1.59 The global economy, including India, has been set back in time by the pandemic induced crisis. In the five years before 2020-21, Indian economy grew at an average growth of 6.7 per cent. In the year 2021-22, a sharp recovery of real GDP growth of 10-12 per cent is expected based on a low base effect and inherent strengths of the economy. It is assumed that the economy grows at its trend growth rate of 6.5 per cent in 2022-23 and 7.0 per cent in 2023-24 aided by the structural reforms. If two scenarios of 12 per cent growth and 10 per cent growth in 2021-22 are envisaged, India would be 91.5 per cent and 90 per cent below the trend level of output respectively by 2023-24 (Figure 46). Figure 46: Scenarios for India's GDP Return to its Trend Path Source: Survey Calculations using data from NSO Note: Real GDP in 2007-08 and 2019-20 have been indexed to 100 1.60 Government recognised this potential 'hysteresis' effect of the pandemic on Indian economy and has, therefore, undertaken a comprehensive reform programme. The structural reforms and the policy push under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Mission are aimed at strengthening 47 State of the Economy 2020-21: A Macro View the fundamentals of the economy - which should put the economy on a strong growth path once the economy recovers from the pandemic shock. These need to be sustained to bolster the Indian economy to reach its potential growth. The policy emphasis has also been on expansion of public investment which would crowd in private investment. Attempts on deregulation and liberalisation of sectors are aimed at improving the business environment to unlock entrepreneurial energies and increase the risk appetite of private investors. The private sector needs to partner the Government in minimising the disruptive impact of the pandemic on the Indian economy. OUTLOOK 1.61 After an estimated 7.7 per cent pandemic-driven contraction in 2020-21, India's real GDP is projected to record a growth of 11.0 percent in 2021-22 and nominal GDP by 15.4 per cent. These conservative estimates reflect upside potential that can manifest due to the continued normalisation in economic activities as the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines gathers traction. This will further be supported by supply-side push from reforms and easing of regulations, push to infrastructural investments, boost to manufacturing sector through the Productivity Linked Incentive Schemes, recovery of pent-up demand for services sector, increase in discretionary consumption subsequent to roll-out of the vaccine and pick up in credit given adequate liquidity and low interest rates. This path would entail a growth in real GDP by 2.4 percent over the absolute level of 2019-20 - implying that the economy would take two years to reach and go past the pre-pandemic level (Figure 47). These projections are in line with IMF estimate of real GDP growth of 11.5 per cent in 2021-22 for India and 6.8 per cent in 2022-23. India is expected to emerge as the fastest growing economy in the next two years as per IMF. Figure 47: Projections of Real GDP for 2021-22 Source: NSO and Survey Calculations 1.62 The new year has dawned with the approval of long-awaited Covid-19 vaccine and initiation of vaccination drives in various countries. With the approval of two indigenously manufactured 48 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 vaccines for emergency use, India initiated the mega vaccination drive on 16th January, 2020. The COVID Vaccine Intelligence Network (Co-WIN) system-a digitalised platform - provides real-time information of vaccine stocks, their storage temperature and individualised tracking of beneficiaries of the vaccine on a real-time basis. 1.63 India became the fastest country to roll-out 10 lakh vaccines in a matter of six days. India has also emerged as a leading supplier of the vaccine to various countries with initiation of exports to Brazil and Morocco on 22nd January, 2021. The swift roll-out of the vaccine gives strength to the optimism on both health and economic fronts - igniting hopes of a robust recovery in services sector, private consumption and investment. CHAPTER AT A GLANCE The year 2020 was predominated by the COVID-19 pandemic, posing the most formidable economic challenge to India and to the world, since the Global Financial Crisis. Global economic output is estimated to fall by 4.4 per cent in 2020, the sharpest contraction in a century. Advanced economies were hit harder, in terms of lives and economic output, compared to Emerging Market Developing Economies. Without a cure or vaccine, tackling this all-pervasive crisis made public health policy crucial. While policymakers faced a dilemma of \"lives versus livelihoods, i.e., flattening the disease curve would invariably entail steepening of the recession curve. Around the globe, governments and central banks deployed a range of policy tools such as lowering key policy rates, quantitative easing measures, loan guarantees, and fiscal stimuli. India enforced an intense lockdown at the onset of the pandemic, characterizing a unique response in several ways driven by the findings from both epidemiological and economic research. India's humane policy response focused on saving human lives, recognising that the short-term pain of an initial, stringent lockdown would lead to long-term gains both in the lives saved and in the pace of the economic recovery. Resultantly , India has managed to avoid the second wave despite continual unlocking. It has ably managed to flatten the epidemiological curve, with the caseload peaking in mid-September followed by a steady drop in daily cases and fatalities. COVID-19 put emer gency brake on an economy that was gaining momentum at the start of the year 2020. India's GDP is estimated to grow by (-)7.7 per cent in FY2021, composed of a sharp 15.7 per cent decline in H1 and a modest (-)0.1 per cent fall in the second half. Agriculture sector has remained the silver lining while contact-based services, manufacturing, construction were hit the hardest. Starting July, a resilient V-shaped recovery is well underway, as demonstrated by the recovery in GDP growth and the sustained resurgence in high frequency indicators such as power demand, E-way bills, GST collection, steel consumption, etc. 49 State of the Economy 2020-21: A Macro View Inflation, mainly driven by food prices, remained above 6 per cent for much of the year, given supply disruptions. The softening of CPI inflation recently reflects easing of supply side constraints that affected food inflation. The weak demand led to a sharper contraction in imports than exports, with Forex reserves rising to cover 18 months of imports. Sharp rise in commercial paper issuances, easing yields, and sturdy credit growth to MSMEs, portend a revamped credit flow mechanism for enterprises to survive and grow. As part of India's four-pillar strategy, calibrated fiscal and monetary support was provided attuned to the evolving economic situation, cushioning the vulnerable in the lockdown and boosting consumption and investment while unlocking. Long-pending structural reforms in agriculture, mining, labour, etc. were concurrently undertaken for the economy to return to the potential growth path, keeping super-hysteresis at bay. The estimated real GDP growth for FY 2022 at 11 per cent is the highest since independence. India became the fastest country to roll-out 10 lakh vaccines in a matter of six days and has also emerged as a leading supplier of the vaccine to Brazil and neighbouring countries. With the economy' s returning to normalcy brought closer by the initiation of a mega vaccination drive, hopes of a robust recovery in services sector, consumption, and investment have been rekindled. India's mature policy response to this \"once-in-a-century\" crisis thus provides important lessons for democracies to avoid myopic policy-making and demonstrates the significant benefits of focusing on long-term gains.

The shortfall in revenue collection owing to the interruption in economic activity and the additional expenditure requirements to mitigate the fallout of the pandemic on vulnerable people, small businesses, and the economy in general, created immense pressure on the available limited fiscal resources. In order to cater to the increased demand for resources, the target for gross market borrowings of the Central Government for the financial year 2020-21 was revised from the Budget estimate of ` 7.8 lakh crore to ` 12 lakh crore. India, therefore, adopted a calibrated approach best suited for the evolving situation of the economy in contrast to front-loaded large stimulus packages adopted by many countries. India's fiscal policy reflected the understanding that aggregate demand, especially that for non-essential items, reflects precautionary motives to save, which inevitably remains high when overall uncertainty is high. Therefore, during the initial months of the pandemic when uncertainty was high and lockdown imposed economic restrictions, India did not waste precious fiscal resources in trying to pump up discretionary consumption. Instead, the policy focused on ensuring that all essentials were taken care of, which included direct benefit transfers to the vulnerable sections, emergency credit to the small businesses, and the world' s largest food subsidy programme targeting 80.96 crore beneficiaries. During the unlock phase, when uncertainty declined and the precautionary motive to save subsided, on the one hand, and economic mobility increased, on the other hand, India ramped up its fiscal spending focusing on overall demand revival. India' s demand-side policy, thus, underscores the idea that pressing on the accelerator while the brakes are clamped only wastes scarce fuel. Owing to the recovery of the economy over the past few months, the monthly revenue collections have witnessed a revival. The monthly GST collections have crossed the ` 1 lakh crore mark consecutively for the last 3 months, reaching its' highest ever in December 2020. Reforms in tax administration have set in motion a process of transparency, accountability and more importantly, enhancing the experience of an honest tax payer with the tax authority, thus incentivising tax compliance. The expenditure policy for 2020-21 has been focused on re-prioritisation of expenditure according to evolving situation, with an increasing emphasis on capital expenditure. Capital expenditure during the last three months of the year 2020 recorded an unprecedented YoY growth of 129 per cent in October, 249 per cent in November and 62 per cent in December. Keeping in view the revenue shortfall and the demand for higher expenditure during the year, the Government Fiscal Developments52 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 INTRODUCTION 2.1 The global economy experienced an unprecedented crisis in the year 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic forced countries to resort to lockdown that had a sudden and intense impact on the economic activity, financial markets and survival of the vulnerable sections of the society. Amidst this phase of shock and uncertainty massive fiscal measures, amounting to 12 percent of global GDP 1, were taken globally to mitigate the adverse impact of the pandemic. Fiscal policy, in combination with monetary policy measures, emerged as an effective policy tool in times of crisis. 2.2 The fiscal policy response of the Government of India to the pandemic was distinct from other countries. Unlike many other countries that chose a front-loaded grand stimulus package for revival of the economy, Government of India adopted a step-by-step approach. The approach was to provide a cushion for the poor and vulnerable section of society and to the business sector (especially the MSMEs) in the initial phase of lockdown. This included the world's largest food programme, direct transfers to Jan Dhan accounts, as well as government guarantees for credit, postponement of financial deadlines etc. With the gradual un-locking of the economy, the focus of the fiscal stimulus has been widened with various measures taken to boost the domestic demand such as ramping up of capital expenditure, Production Linked Incentives and other schemes to revive consumption demand. 2.3. This chapter reviews the fiscal developments in India both before and after the outbreak of pandemic. It begins with a discussion of fiscal performance and policy response to the pandemic in the current financial year, followed by the section on the major reforms introduced in tax administration in 2020-21. The chapter then gives a detailed analysis of the medium to long term trends in Central, State and General Government finances, and concludes with a snapshot of the outlook for 2021-22. FISCAL SITUATION AND RESPONSE TO COVID-19 PANDEMIC 2.4 The pandemic year 2020-21 has so far entailed fiscal challenges for the Indian economy, which were characterized by additional expenditure requirements directed towards ensuring basic means of sustenance and livelihoods for the vulnerable people, relief measures for MSME sector, accommodating additional health infrastructure and services to fight COVID-19 and measures to boost the demand. Throughout this period, the Government followed a carefully calibrated strategy in the management of expenditure. 2.5 During the first two quarters of financial year 2020-21, Ministries were classified into three categories. Ministries in category 'A' were providing relief or welfare to the public. No expenditure restrictions were placed on these Ministries and in fact enhanced allocations were made available to them. Other Ministries which were not directly involved in the pandemic were placed in the category 'B' and allowed to spend 20% of their budget per quarter. Ministries with low priority in the pandemic situation were placed in category 'C' and allowed to spend 1as on September 11, 2020 (October 2020 IMF Fiscal outlook)is expected to register a fiscal slippage in 2020-21. This deviation from the path of fiscal consolidation may however be transient as the fiscal indicators rebound with the recovery in the economy. Thus, focusing on boosting GDP growth would be pivotal for enabling a sustainable fiscal path in the medium term.53 Fiscal Developments 15% of their budget in each of the first two quarters. However, even in Category B and C Ministries, spending on domestic capital expenditure was permitted beyond these ceilings. This categorization enabled the Government to ensure that funds for essential activities were made available in full despite a sharp contraction in revenue receipts, and that scarce resources were conserved for re-prioritisation. 2.6 With effect from the third quarter, the spending ceilings were relaxed on the basis of revised full year allocations. The revised allocations reflected a substantial re-prioritisation of expenditure to those sectors with the most positive effect on the economy, either in terms of re-kindling growth or meeting welfare needs. Ministries were allowed to decide the timing of expenditure within the revised allocation. Despite the absence of curbs on capital expenditure, the pace of capital expenditure was restrained in the first two quarters on account of movement restrictions in containment zones, and unwillingness or inability of contractors and workers to carry out works. 2.7 With the easing of movement and health-related restrictions in the third quarter, the pace of government expenditure has picked up sharply. Second to pandemic relief, the Government has placed maximum priority on productive domestic capital expenditure which has a high multiplier effect on the economy. The capital expenditure for April to December 2020 (Flash) 2 stood at ` 3.17 lakh crore, 24 per cent higher than the capital expenditure during the corresponding period in the previous year. The total expenditure also recorded a YoY growth of 11 per cent, increasing from ` 21.1 lakh crore during April to December 2019 to ` 23.4 lakh crore during April to December 2020 (Flash). An analysis of the monthly expenditure also shows that the total expenditure registered an increase during the last three months of the year 2020 by 9.5 per in October, 48.3 per cent in November and 50.2 per cent in December (Flash) compared to the same months in the previous year. Moreover, the capital expenditure during the last three months of the year 2020 recorded a phenomenal growth of 129.5 per cent in October, 248.5 per cent in November and 81.9 per cent in December (Flash) as compared to same months in previous year (Figure 1). It can clearly be seen that by timing the expenditure push, especially the capital expenditure, after the reduction in health-related curbs, the growth \"bang\" for the fiscal buck has been maximized.

Monthly GST revenues for the month of December 2020 stood at ` 1.15 lakh crore, after registering a 12 per cent growth in the GST revenues over December 2019 (Figure 3). This has been the highest monthly GST collection since the introduction of GST. The recovery in GST collection has been due to the combined effect of the rapid economic recovery post pandemic and the nation-wide drive against GST evaders and fake bills along with many systemic changes introduced recently, which have led to improved compliance.

The data on Government accounts for April to November 2020, released by the Controller General of Accounts, show that the fiscal deficit of the Central Government at end November 2020 stood at 135.1 per cent of the BE compared to 114.8 per cent during the same period in 2019-20 (Table 1). Given the enormity of the situation faced by the pandemic, most of the countries including India have been fiscally strained, which reflected in the deficit figures. In order to cater to the increased demand for resources required by the Government, the target for gross market borrowings of the Central Government for the financial year 2020-21 was revised from the Budget estimate of ` 7.8 lakh crore to ` 12 lakh crore.

During April to November 2020, the non-debt receipts have registered a growth of -17.9 percent relative to the corresponding period last year (Table 1). This shortfall is attributed to a fall in all components of non-debt receipts viz. net tax revenue, non-tax revenue and non-debt capital receipts. The Non-Tax revenue collections up to November 2020 registered a decrease of 46.6 per cent relative to the corresponding period last year. This was led by a decrease in dividends and profits by ` 0.88 lakh crore over April to November 2019, which stood at 45.4 per cent of BE.56 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Figure 4: Growth rate of fiscal indicators in 2020-21 (up to November 2020) 0.8 -0.97.0 November 2020-21 Source: CGA Monthly Accounts 2.11 The Gross Tax Revenue during the first eight months of 2020-21 was ` 10.26 lakh crore, 42% of BE, 12.6 per cent lower than in the same period last year. This decline was owing to the negative growth in all direct taxes and major indirect taxes, except excise duties. In particular, the shortfall in direct tax collection contributed to 92 per cent of the shortfall in Gross Tax Revenue. Out of the shortfall in GTR of ` 1.48 lakh crore relative to corresponding period last year, a shortfall of more than ` 1 lakh crore was attributed to Corporation taxes, shortfall ` 0.3 lakh crore was due to Personal Income taxes and ` 0.14 lakh crore was due to the Indirect taxes. The Corporation Tax and Personal Income Tax stood at 27.3 per cent of BE and 36.8 per cent of BE for the period up to November 2020. 2.12 The shortfall in indirect taxes during April to November 2020 was led by shortfall in customs and GST collections for the Centre. Revenue collection from customs stood at 45.7 per cent of BE and GST collections for the Centre were 48 per cent of BE during April to November 2020. This shortfall was partly offset by the revenue collection through the excise duties, which rose by 48 per cent during the first eight months of the fiscal relative to the same period last year. A series of measures undertaken for direct and indirect taxes in the year 2020-21 in the wake of COVID-19 are presented in Annex. These measures focused on supporting the businesses and individuals by extension of time limits for compliances and statutory actions, improving the working capital/ liquidity availability with the industry/ trade, simplification of procedures and use of technology for submission of documents or holding personal hearings so as to reduce the physical interface between the tax payer and the department, expeditious clearance of drugs/ medicines/ safety and medical equipment required for COVID-19 treatment/ prevention. 2.13 The adverse market conditions arising due to COVID-19 have also negatively impacted the Government's plans to achieve the target for disinvestment receipts, which is a major component of Non-debt Capital receipts. The Budget 2020-21 had envisaged to mobilize ` 2.1 lakh crore from disinvestment proceeds during current fiscal year, of which ` 90,000 crore was envisaged for disinvestment in financial institutions. As on 20th January, 2021, the Government has been able to raise ` 15,220 crore of which ` 443 crore was raised through Initial Public Offer (IPO) (Mazagaon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL)), while ` 10,169 was 57 Fiscal Developments realized through Offer For Sale (` 4924 crore- Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), ` Limited (BDL) and ` 4474 crore- Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd (IRCTC), ` 2770 crore was yielded through buyback (` 156 KIOCL, ` 1065 crore- NTPC and ` 1376 crore- NMDC Ltd), and ` 1838 crore from other transactions. During the year, the Government announced the Atma Nirbhar Bharat package that sought to redefine public sector participation in commercial enterprises. The Government recognizes the need for opening up all the sectors to the private sector while public sector enterprises play an important role in strategic areas. The focus of the Government is to embark on a significant privatisation exercise of CPSEs and speeding up big-ticket strategic sale/ privatisation of large CPSEs such as Air India, BPCL, CONCOR and SCI. 2.14 The expenditure policy during the year 2020-21 has focused on restructuring and prioritisation of expenditure to meet the unforeseen expenditure demands arising due to COVID-19. The total Government expenditure during April to November 2020 stood at 62.7 per cent of Budget estimate, compared to 65.3 per cent in April to November 2019. The revenue expenditure has grown by 3.7 per cent during the first eight months of 2020-21 compared to the same period in 2019-20. The monthly accounts data up to November 2020 shows that subsidies registered a negative growth of 14 per cent during the first eight months of FY 2020-21 (refer to Table 2). The Revised Estimates would give more clarity on the subsidy expenditure during the current year. The decline in global petroleum prices acted as an important fiscal shock absorber during 2020-21, as it led to a decline in petroleum subsidies and an increase in revenue collection from excise duties (owing to increased excise duty levies on petroleum products).

This is in addition to ` 4.12 lakh crore Capital Expenditure estimated in Budget 2020-21. The capital expenditure during April to November 2020 has grown by 12.8 per cent over the same period in 2019-20.58 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 2.16 During the past months, positive signs of recovery in revenue collections have been seen in terms of positive growth in monthly GST collections and more than 50 per cent growth in revenue receipts for the month of October 2020 and November 2020 relative to the corresponding months of 2019. However, given the adverse impact of COVID-19 on economic activities particularly the decline in individual and corporate incomes, consumption of goods and services and the muted domestic and international trade in the first half of FY 2020-21, it is expected that the tax revenues may fall short of the Budget estimates during 2020-21. Therefore keeping in view the concurrent demand of expenditure pertaining to the stimulus packages announced by the Government during the year to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and the anticipated revenue shortfall, it is expected that the fiscal deficit of the Central Government may overshoot its Budget Estimate for the current fiscal year. The details of the fiscal policy stimulus package announced by Government in response to COVID-19 may be seen in Box 2. 2.17 In view of this shock on the fiscal system induced by COVID-19, the important concern therefore is whether the medium term fiscal policy strategy should focus on growth or fiscal restraint. Chapter 2 in V olume I of the Survey discusses this in detail. Adoption of countercyclical expansionary fiscal policy in times of crisis is expected to boost the growth in GDP both directly, and indirectly through multiplier effects on private consumption expenditure and private investment. Higher GDP growth would thereby facilitate buoyant revenue collection in the medium term, and thereby enable a sustainable fiscal path. Box 1: Fiscal Policy response to COVID-19 across the globe The economies across the world have undertaken massive use of fiscal policy measures with an objective to protect the lives and livelihoods against the health and economic effect of COVID-19 pandemic, to boost the demand and foster the reopening of the economies after the lockdown phase. The fiscal measures adopted have been diverse, comprising of above the line measures, below the line measures and contingent liabilities (guarantees, quasi-fiscal operations). \"Above-the-line\" measures include those for which full cost is reflected in the fiscal deficit, government debt, and increased borrowing needs in the short term. These measures include additional spending (for example, health services and unemployment benefits); capital grants and targeted transfers (for example, wage subsidies or direct transfers); or tax measures (for example, tax cuts or other relief) provided through standard budget channels. \"Below-the-line\" measures are defined as generally involve the creation of assets, like equity injections, loans, asset purchase etc., which may have little or no upfront impact on the fiscal deficit all although they can later increase debt or reduce liquidity (IMF Fiscal Monitor April 2020). The composition of various above-the-line measures and other liquidity support measures announced by the governments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as of September, 2020, may be seen in Figure 5 and Table 3. These estimates by IMF show that Government of India announced above-the-line measures equivalent to 2.2 per cent of GDP and other liquidity support measures of around 5.3 per cent of GDP up to September, 2020. It may be noted that additional fiscal measures equivalent to 1.7 per cent of GDP were introduced by the Government of India in October & November 2020 (See Box 2). Although India's measures were smaller than those of other developed countries, they were successful in facilitating a recovery in the economy. This also leaves India with a greater elbow room to deploy fiscal resources in the future.59 Fiscal Developments Figure 5: Above the line measures (as a percent of GDP) - upto September 2020 1.5 1.5 0.9 1.0 0.6 0.7 0.9 0.1 0.2 0.5 0.2 0.2 0.4 10.3 7.6 11.6 10.3 4.6 7.7 7.4 4.5 1.6 2.2 0.5 2.2 4.9 0.1 0.2 3.9 4.9 2.5 0.0 2.9 1.6 0.4 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.9 0.02.04.06.08.010.012.014.016.018.0 United StatesUnited KingdomCanada Japan France Germany Brazil China India Indonesia Mexico Russia South Africa health sector Non-health sector Accelerated spending / deferred revenue Source: IMF Fiscal Outlook, October 2020.

Box 2: Fiscal Stimulus by Government of India In order to facilitate a resilient recovery of the economy from the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and the following lockdown, Government of India and RBI together announced a total stimulus worth ` 29.87 lakh crore, which is 15% of national GDP. Out of this, stimulus worth 9% of GDP has been provided by the Government under Atma Nirbhar Bharat Package. This stimulus was provided in the following tranches: a. Special economic and comprehensive package, announced from 13-17 May 2020. b. Measures to stimulate consumer spending in the economy announced on 12 October 2020. c. Measures under Atma Nirbhar Bharat 3.0 announced on 12 November 2020.60 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 It may be emphasized that in contrast with the fiscal policy approach adopted by some of the other countries, whereby a one-time large demand stimulus package was announced, the fiscal stimulus by the Government of India was introduced in a phased manner. The special economic and comprehensive package announced in the initial phase of lockdown focused on measures to primarily provide a cushion to the vulnerable sections of the society and the small businesses. This included direct food transfers to the poor and vulnerable, livelihood programmes, guarantees and liquidity enhancing measures. Subsequently, along with the steady unwinding of the lockdown and restrictions, the demand side impetus was given to re-inflate consumption demand. When the economic recovery began after the lifting up of the lockdown, the focus of the stimulus measures shifted towards on investment boosting measures like Production Linked Incentives, enhancing capital expenditure and steps to encourage investment in infrastructure sector. This change in mix of the stimulus measures, as shown in the figure below, reflects that the fiscal policy had the flexibility of adapting to an evolving situation in order to enable a resilient recovery.

Source: PIB REFORMS IN TAX ADMINISTRATION 2.18 The Government has consistently adopted reform measures aimed at the long term benefits of a more transparent, efficient and tax-payer friendly tax administration. A major step in this direction is the introduction of 'Honoring the Honest' platform. The platform for 'Transparent taxation- Honoring the Honest' was launched in August 2020 with an objective to impart greater efficiency, transparency and accountability, and to eliminate physical interface between taxpayers and tax officers. The key features of the platform are (i) Usage of technology, data analytics and Artificial Intelligence and (ii) Recognizing taxpayers as partners in nation-building. The Platform stands on 3 pillars of tax administration reforms namely, Faceless assessment, Faceless appeal, and Taxpayers' charter. The platform is designed to ensure fairness by adopting measures like random selection through system using data analytics and Artificial Intelligence, dynamic jurisdiction, automated random allocation of cases, team based assessment/ review, provision of draft assessment order/review and finalization of the order in different cities each and no requirement of physical interface between taxpayers and the Income Tax department. Faceless Assessment Scheme 2020 2.19 The Faceless Assessment Scheme, 2019 (earlier called the e-assessment Scheme and renamed in August 2020) was based on the idea that automated random allocation of cases across Income Tax teams with dynamic jurisdiction and elimination of face-to-face contact 63 Fiscal Developments between the income-tax authorities and the taxpayer can lead to an efficient, non-discretionary, unbiased single window system of assessment. In 2020, the scope of Faceless Assessment Scheme 2019 was broadened by bringing all the pending assessment cases across the country within the purview of the Scheme and declaring that any order passed outside the scheme shall be invalid. 2.20 The scheme establishes a National Faceless Assessment Centre (NFAC) in Delhi, headed by Principal Chief Commissioner of Income Tax, as the sole point of contact between the Department and the taxpayer. All notices or communications to and from the taxpayer, and internal communications related to assessment process within the Department are routed through the NFAC. To further facilitate and streamline the process of assessment there are various Regional Faceless Assessment Centers which are vested with the power to make assessments. A schematic diagram of Faceless Assessment procedure may be seen in figure 7. Figure 7: Faceless Assessment Procedure Source: Survey compilation based on inputs from Department of Revenue. Note: NFAC: National Faceless Assessment Centre, AU: Assessment unit, TU: Technical Unit, VU: Verification Unit, RU: Review Unit, DAO: Draft Assessment Order.64 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Faceless Appeals Scheme 2020 2.21 Under Faceless Appeals Scheme, 2020, all Income Tax appeals will be finalised in a faceless manner under the faceless ecosystem with the exception of appeals relating to serious frauds, major tax evasion, sensitive & search matters, International tax and Black Money Act. 2.22 The Scheme establishes a National Faceless Appeal Centre (NFApC) as the apex body for conduct of e-appeal proceedings in a centralized manner. Under the NFApC are Regional Faceless Appeal Centers (RFAC) to facilitate the e-appeal proceedings. The Appeal Units, headed by one or more Commissioner (Appeals) and are placed under the RFAC. The NFApC will be the only point of contact between the taxpayer and the underlying Appeal Units; and Appeal Units and NeAC/Assessing Officer. All internal and external communication takes place electronically and the assessee or the Assessing Officer are not required to attend the proceedings personally or through an authorised representative. A schematic diagram of Faceless Appeals procedure may be seen in the figure below. Figure 8: Faceless Appeal Procedure Source: Survey compilation based on inputs from Department of Revenue. Note: NFApC: National Faceless Appeal Centre, NFAC: National Faceless Assessment Centre, APU: Appeal Unit, DAPO: Draft Appeal Order Taxpayers' Charter 2.23 The third pillar of Honoring the Honest platform is the introduction of taxpayers' charter. 65 Fiscal Developments The taxpayer's charter for India comprises of commitments by the Income Tax Deparment and obligations of the taxpayers. A detailed discussion on the taxpayers' charter may be seen in Box 3. Box 3: Introduction of Taxpayers' Charter Traditionally tax administrations paid limited attention to taxpayer service while performing the functions of regulator and enforcer of tax laws. However, due to an increased demand for better services to the tax payers, there has been a worldwide recognition of the rights of the tax payers, by publishing formal 'taxpayers' charters' or including behaviour expected from officials in the revenue body's 'mission statement'. For instance, the concept of taxpayers' Bill of Rights was first introduced in the US in 1988 and the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, which grouped the existing rights in the tax code into ten clearly defined fundamental rights and applied to all taxpayers, was adopted by the revenue authorities in 2014. Similarly, the Canadian taxpayers' Bill of Rights defining 16 taxpayers' rights, was adopted in May 2007 to increase the accountability of the Canada revenue Agency to taxpayers and to enhance the level of awareness among taxpayers about their rights and avenues of redress when dealing with revenue authorities. The UK government published its first charter concerned with taxpayer interactions with revenue authorities in 1986, and adopted the new publication 'Your Charter', which explicitly sets out rights and obligations of taxpayers in 2009 (subsequently refreshed in 2016). The introduction of taxpayer charter by Government of India as a part of the 'Honoring the Honest' platform is, thus, an important step in this direction, as it emphasizes the importance of fair, courteous and reasonable treatment to taxpayer. The tax payer charter includes the following, as a part of Income Tax Department's commitment: 1. Courteous, fair and reasonable treatment to taxpayers. 2. Treatment of taxpayers as honest unless the department has a reason to believe otherwise. 3. Fair and impartial appeal procedure and review mechanism. 4. Accurate and complete information for fulfilling tax compliance obligations under the law . 5. Timely decisions in every income tax proceeding (within the time prescribed under law). 6. Collection of the correct amount of tax due as per the law. 7. Respect for taxpayer's privacy by following due process of law, and ensuring no more intrusive than necessary in inquiry, examination, or enforcement action. 8. Maintaining confidentiality by not disclosing any information provided by taxpayer to the department unless authorized by law. 9. Ensuring accountability for the actions of the tax authorities. 10. Provision to allow taxpayer to choose an authorized representative of his choice. 11. Provision for a mechanism to lodge complaint and ensure its prompt disposal thereof. 12. Fair and impartial system and resolving the tax issues in a time-bound manner 13. Publishing the service standards and report periodically by the T ax Department. 14. Reduced cost of compliance as the Department shall duly take into account the cost of compliance when administering tax legislation. The taxpayers' obligations specified under the Charter are: 1. Taxpayer is expected to honestly disclose full information and fulfil his compliance obligations.66 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 2. Taxpayer i s expected to be aware of his compliance obligations under tax law and seek help of department if needed. 3. Taxpayer is expected to keep accurate records required as per law . 4. Taxpayer is expected to know what information and submissions are made by his authorised representative. 5. Taxpayer is expected to make submissions as per tax law in a timely manner . 6. Taxpayer is ex pected to pay amount due as per law in a timely manner. Need for an independent Ombudsman - to ensure enforcement of taxpayers' rights In addition to explicitly recognizing the taxpayers' rights, presence of a dedicated institution aimed to take up issues from taxpayers' perspective helps in developing trust of the taxpayers in the system. This ensures that the taxpayers understand their rights and are treated fairly. Thus the next step may be to ensure enforcement of rights. India's experience with Tax Ombudsman In India, the institution of Income Tax Om budsman was created in 2003 and Indirect Tax Ombudsman came to existence in 2011. The ombudsman was appointed at the regional offices by the Central Government from amongst the serving officers, to enquire into grievances/ complaints against the functioning of the tax authority. Since the functioning of Ombudsman was governed by the guidelines (Income Tax Ombudsman Guidelines 2010 and Indirect Tax Ombudsman Guidelines 2011), and there was no act of law empowering it with different functions, the institution of Ombudsman was ineffective and the decisions only advisory in nature. The Ombudsman could settle complaints either through agreements between the complainant and the tax department through conciliation and mediation or by passing an award, with a token compensation for loss suffered by the complainant not exceeding ` 5,000. The institutions of Ombudsman for direct and indirect taxes were, therefore, abolished in February 2019. The present tax grievance redressal system consists of grievance cells headed by department officials/ Aaykar Sewa Kendras (ASK), e-nivaran portal which is a separate and dedicated window for grievance redressal in the Income Tax Business Application, and CPGRAMS (Central Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System). Global experience with Independent tax Ombudsman The global experience suggests that countries with an independent tax Ombudsman have performed better on the tax administration front through better trust between taxpayers and tax authorities, and have exhibited a higher average Tax to GDP ratio and lower time taken to file taxes (OECD 2017). Dedicated bodies like the Ombudsman in Australia, Canada, UK, Brazil, South Africa and tax mediators in Belgium and France look into tax related complaints across many countries. These bodies are independent of the tax administration. For instance US have an independent organization within the IRS called the Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) to act as the guardian of taxpayers rights. It protects taxpayer rights and promotes 67 Fiscal Developments taxpayer confidence in the integrity and accountability of the IRS; and has significant independent powers. It is headed by the National Taxpayer Advocate and has a local presence and accessibility through Local Taxpayer Advocate and Low-Income Taxpayer Clinics. Similarly the Office of the Taxpayers' Ombudsman (OTO) established in 2007 in Canada is mandated to review and address the complaints relating to the services provided to a taxpayer by the CRA, thus working to enhance CRA accountability in its service to, and treatment of, taxpayers through independent and objective reviews of service-related complaints and systemic issues. Based on best international practices of Canada, US and UK, an independent Tax Ombud system was established in South Africa in the year 2013 through Tax Administration Act (TAA). The Tax Ombud is appointed by and reports directly to the Minister of Finance, with the mandate to review and address any taxpayer complaint regarding any service, procedural or administrative matter arising from the application of the provisions of the Tax Act A Possible solution International experience suggests an ombudsman system is necessary for ensuring protection of taxpayer's rights. However the institution, in India's past experience, was not effective and was abolished. A possible reason may have been inadequate independence from the tax department. Therefore, there is a need to reinvigorate the systems of grievance redressal in India, and incorporate a more holistic view of enhancing customer experience and protecting taxpayer rights. In such a case to avoid the conflict of interest, ensure fair dealings and consequently build the trust between taxpayers and the concerned tax authority, it is imperative that the redressal organisation has adequate teeth and is independent of the tax department. Such an institution would thereby make the 'Honoring the Honest' platform more successful by ensuring accountability and trust in the tax administration system. TRENDS IN GOVERNMENT FINANCES: CENTRE, STATES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT Central Government Finances 2.24 During the year 2019-20, the structural reforms initiated by the Central Government to boost the economic performance had fiscal implications for the economy. As a result the Fiscal Deficit for 2019-20 Provisional Actuals stood at 4.6 per cent of GDP, which was 0.8 percentage points higher than the Fiscal Deficit envisaged in 2019-20 RE, and 1.2 percentage points higher than Fiscal deficit in 2018-19. The effective Revenue Deficit which captures the shortfall in current receipts over current expenditure also increased by 1 per cent of GDP to reach 2.4 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 PA relative to 2018-19 (Figure 9). 2.25 The Medium T erm Fiscal Policy (MTFP) Statement presented with Budget 2020-21 pegged the fiscal deficit target for FY 2020-21 at 3.5% of GDP, after providing adequate space for fiscal impact of the reforms adopted by the Government in FY 2019-20. Major fiscal indicators of the Central Government and their growth rates are presented in Table 5 and Table 6, respectively. 68 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Figure 9: Trends in Deficits Effective RD PD FD (RHS) Source: Union Documents Provisional ActualsFD: Fiscal Deficit; RD: Revenue Deficit; Primary Figures in parenthesis are as a per cent of GDP) Revenue Receipts 11.01 11.95 13.74 14.35 15.53 16.82 20.21 (8.8) (8.7) (8.9) (8.4) (8.2) Tax Revenue 12.45 14.56 17.16 19.19 20.80 20.10 24.23 (10) (10.6) (11.2) (11.2) tax revenue 9.04 9.44 11.01 12.42 13.17 13.56 16.36 (7.2) Non-tax revenue 1.98 2.51 2.73 1.93 2.36 3.26 3.85 (1.6) (1.8) (1.8) (1.1) (1.2) (1.6) (1.7) Non-debt capital receipts* 0.51 0.63 0.65 1.16 1.13 0.69 2.25 (0.4) (0.5) (0.4) (0.7) (0.6) (0.3) (1) Non-debt receipts 11.53 12.58 14.4 15.51 16.66 17.51 22.46 (9.2) (9.1) (9.4) (9.1) (8.8) (8.6) (10) Total Expenditure 16.64 17.91 19.75 21.42 23.15 26.86 30.42 (13.3) (13.0) 14.67 15.38 16.91 18.79 20.07 23.50 26.30 (11.8) (11.2) (11.0) (11.0) (10.6) (11.6) (11.7) Capital Expenditure 1.97 2.53 2.85 2.63 3.08 3.37 4.12 (1.6) (1.8) (1.9) (1.5) (1.6) (1.7) (1.8) Fiscal Deficit 5.11 5.33 5.36 5.91 6.49 9.36 7.9669 Fiscal Developments (4.1) (3.9) (3.5) (3.5) (3.4) (4.6) (3.5) Revenue Deficit 3.66 3.43 3.16 4.44 4.54 6.68 6.09 (2.9) (2.5) (2.1) (2.6) (2.4) (3.3) (2.7) Primary Deficit 1.08 0.91 0.55 0.62 0.67 3.25 0.88 (0.9) (0.7) (0.4) (0.4) (0.4) (1.6) (0.4) Memo Item GDP at Market Price 124.68 137.72 153.62 PA: Provisional Actuals*includes disinvestment proceeds Table 6: Growth rate of Central Government's 8.2 8.3 20.1 Gross Tax Revenue 16.9 17.9 11.8 8.4 -3.4 20.6 Net tax revenue 4.4 16.7 12.8 6.0 2.9 20.7 Non-tax revenue 27.0 8.6 -29.4 22.3 38.4 22.3 3.8 77.0 -2.5 -39.2 227.8 Total Non Debt Receipt 9.1 14.4 7.7 7.4 5.1 28.3 Total Expenditure 7.6 10.3 8.4 8.1 16.0 13.2 Revenue Expenditure 4.8 9.9 11.1 6.8 17.0 11.9 Capital Expenditure 28.6 12.5 -7.5 16.9 9.4 22.4 Source: Union Budget Documents & CGA BE: Budget Estimate, PA: Provisional Actuals* Rate of growth 2018-19 Actual^ Rate of growth vis-\u00e0-vis 2019-20 PA#includes disinvestment proceeds Trends in Receipts 2.26 Central government receipts can broadly be divided into Non-debt and debt receipts. The Non-debt receipts comprise of tax and Non-T ax revenue, and Non-debt Capital receipts like recovery of loans and disinvestment receipts. Debt receipts mostly comprise of market borrowings and other liabilities, which the government is obliged to repay in the future. Tax Revenue 2.27 Budget 2020-21 estimated the Gross Tax Revenue (GTR) to be ` 24.23 lakh crore which is 10.8 per cent of GDP. This builds into growth of 12 per cent over the revised estimates (RE) of 2019-20 and 20.6 per cent over 2019-20 PA. The direct taxes, comprising mainly of corporate and personal income tax, constitute around 55 per cent of GTR. These were envisaged to grow at 12.7 per cent relative to 2019-20 RE and 27.2 per cent relative to 2019-20 PA. On the other hand, the indirect taxes were expected to grow at 11.1 per cent vis-\u00e0-vis 2019-20 RE and 15 per cent as against 2019-20 PA. The contribution of different taxes in GTR as envisaged in 2020-21 BE is shown in Figure 10. 70 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Figure 10: Composition of taxes in Gross Tax Revenue in 2020-21 BE GTR Source: Union Budget Documents & CGA GTR: Gross Tax Revenue, CIT: Corporation Tax, ToI: Taxes on Income other than Corporation Tax (includes STT), C: Customs, UED: Union Excise Duties, GST: Goods and Services Tax 2.28 The trends in major taxes in relation to GDP displayed in Figure 11 show that receipts from corporate and personal income tax have come down in 2019-20 P A compared to the trend of improvement observed over the previous years. This is due to the moderation in growth of the economy during 2019-20 and implementation of structural reforms like Corporate Tax rate cut. As against the 2020-21 BE of ` 16.36 lakh crore for Net Tax Revenue to the Centre, the actual realization up to November 2020 has been ` 6.88 lakh crore, which is 42.1 per cent of BE.

The contribution of Non-debt Capital receipts in the total pool of Non- debt receipts have declined from 6.8 per cent in 2018-19 to 3.9 per cent 2019-20 PA, primarily due to shortfall in disinvestment proceeds (Figure 12). The Non-debt Capital receipts have been pegged at ` 2.3 lakh crore that is 1 per cent of GDP in 2020-21 BE. The major component of Non- debt Capital receipts is disinvestment receipts that accrue to the government on sale of public sector enterprises owned by the government (including sale of strategic assets). Government envisaged to mobilize ` 2.1 lakh crore on account of disinvestment proceeds as per 2020-21 BE.

As a percentage of GDP, the anticipated growth of total expenditure in 2020-21 BE over 2019-20 PA is 0.3 per cent of GDP with growth equivalent to 0.15 per cent of GDP each in both Revenue and capital expenditure. 2.32 Revenue Expenditure, which constitutes over 87 per cent of the total expenditure was envisaged to grow at 1 1.9 per cent in 2020-21 BE over 2019-20 PA. This is a modest growth rate relative to the 17 per cent growth of revenue expenditure in 2019-20 PA over 2018-19. Interest payments (26 per cent), Defence Revenue expenditure (9 per cent), Major Subsidies (10 per cent), Grants-in-aid to States/UTs (22 per cent) and Pension (8 per cent) are the major items of revenue Expenditure which together accounted for nearly 65% of the total expenditure, as per 2019-20 PA (Table 8). Several initiatives undertaken by the Ministry of Defence for utilization of defence expenditure and improving efficiency, promoting self- reliance, and encouraging private sector participation in the defence sector may be seen at Annex 3.

Hence the focus of expenditure restructuring and management measures is targeted on the non-committed component such as 73 Fiscal Developments subsidies. In 2016, approximately 66 Centrally Sponsored Schemes were rationalized into 28 Umbrella Schemes. The cycle of these Schemes was also made co-terminus with the Finance Commission cycle, to ensure more clarity on flow of resources available to both the Union and the State Governments over a Finance Commission cycle. 2.34 The expenditure on major subsidies which was pegged at 1.0 per cent of GDP in 2020-21 BE, accounted for a moderate growth of 2.1 per cent over 2019-20 PA. In 2019-20 PA, there was an increase of 13.9 per cent in the subsidy bill of the Government, as the food, fertilizer and petroleum subsidies grew by 7.3 per cent, 14.9 per cent and 34.5 per cent respectively, relative to 2018-19. 2.35 With a low tax to GDP ratio, Central Government faces the challenge of providing sufficient funds for investment and infrastructure expansion while staying within the bounds of fiscal prudence. Therefore, improving the composition and quality of expenditure assumes significance. Over the past few years, the quality of expenditure measured in terms of the share of capital expenditure in total expenditure has on an average sustained at a level (Figure 13). It is estimated to increase roughly by a percentage point in 2020-21 BE over 2019-20 PA which accounts for an expected growth of 22.4 per cent in capital expenditure over 2019-20 PA. The major sectors apart from defence services, that account for bulk of capital expenditure allocation in 2020-21 BE include industry and minerals, construction of roads and bridges, communication services, and space technology. Figure 13: Trends in components of Expenditure/ Total Expenditure (%) (RHS) Source: Union Budget Documents & CGA BE: Budget Estimate, PA: Provisional Actuals 2.36 Apart from budgetary spending, Extra Budgetary Resources (EBR) have also been mobilized to finance infrastructure investment since 2016-17. EBRs are those financial liabilities that are raised by public sector undertakings for which repayment of entire principal and interest is done from the Central Government Budget. Government has raised EBRs of ` 1.35 lakh crore during the period from 2016-17 to 2019-20. It proposes to raise EBR of ` 49,500 crore in 2020-21 BE which is 0.22 per cent of GDP. 74 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Transfer to States 2.37 The Central Government has accepted the recommendations made by the Fifteenth Finance Commission (FC-XV) in its Report for financial year 2020-21, relating to the Post Devolution Revenue Deficit Grant, Grants to Local bodies and Disaster Management Grants for the financial year 2020-21. FC-XV recommended Grant-in-Aid amounting to ` 1.99 lakh crore for transfer to States during 2020-21 for Post Devolution Revenue Deficit Grant, Grants to Local bodies and Disaster Management Grants which is approximately 50% higher than recommended by the FC-XIV for the award year 2019-20 (Table 9). 2.38 Out of the corpus of ` 90,000 crore allocated as grant for local bodies in the year 2020-21, 32.5 per cent have been recommended for urban local bodies and the remaining for rural local bodies. Unlike that of the FC-XIV recommended grants, the local bodies grant during the year 2020-21 were also allocated to Fifth and Sixth Schedule Area as well as Mandal/Tehsil and District/Zila Panchayats in case of rural local bodies, and also allocated to fifty-nine Cantonment Boards in case of the urban local bodies. Moreover for the first time, Finance Commission grants were also allocated for the purpose of improving ambient air quality in million plus cities/ urban agglomerations.

The Budget 2020-21 envisaged a rebound in the total transfers to States from 5.7 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 RE to 6 per cent of GDP in 2020-21 BE.

These liabilities include external debt (end-of-the financial year) at current exchange rate but exclude part of NSSF liabilities to the extent of States' borrowings from the NSSF and investments in public agencies out of the NSSF, which do not finance Central Government deficit. Total liabilities of the Central Government at end March 2020 stood at ` 97.05 lakh crore (refer to Table 11). Out of these, 88.67 per cent was public debt and the remaining 10 per cent catered to Public Account liabilities, which include National Small Savings Fund, State Provident Funds, Reserve Funds and Deposits and other Accounts. Table 11: Debt Position of the Central Government (in ` Lakh crore) 2014-15 2015-16 97.05 Source: Various issues of Status Paper on Government Debt and Quarterly Report on Public Debt; P: Provisional 2.41 Figure 14 shows that total liabilities of the Central Government, as a ratio of GDP, declined steadily immediately after the enactment of the FRBM Act, 2003, and has sustained at a level during the last decade.

This is owing to low share of external debt in the debt portfolio and almost entire external borrowings being from official sources. Further, most of the public debt has been contracted at fixed interest rate making India's debt stock virtually insulated from interest rate volatility. This lends certainty and stability to budget in terms of interest payments. 2.43 The other salient feature is the gradual elongation of the maturity profile of the Central government's debt (refer to Figure 15) leading to reduced rollover risks. The proportion of dated securities maturing in less than five years has seen consistent decline in recent years. The weighted average maturity of outstanding stock of dated securities of the GOI has increased from 9.7 years at end March 2010 to 10.7 years at end March 2020.

The average Gross Fiscal Deficit Budget Estimate for states that presented their budgets before the outbreak of COVID-19 was 2.4 per cent of GSDP, while the average for budgets presented post-lockdown was 4.6 per cent of GSDP (RBI Study on State Finances). Figure 16 depicts the trend of fiscal consolidation for the combined States in the last 3 years, with an average Gross Fiscal Deficit of 2.46 per cent of GDP. The Gross Fiscal Deficit for States is however expected to shoot up relative to the pegged Budget estimate during 2020-21. 2.45 As per 2020-21 Budget Estimates of the State Governments, the States' combined own Tax revenue and own Non-Tax revenue were anticipated to grow at 11.8 per cent and 12.1 per cent respectively over 2019-20 RE, higher than the growth displayed in 2019-20 RE. On the expenditure side, revenue expenditure and capital expenditure in 2020-21 BE were envisaged to grow at 8.2 per cent and 11.8 per cent respectively over 2019-20 RE (refer to Table 12). 77 Fiscal Developments Figure 16: Major deficit and debt indicators of States 2.0 2.22.63.03.5 2.4 2.42.6 Percent of GDPPercent of GDP Gross Fiscal Deficit Revenue Deficit Debt-GDP (RHS) Source: RBI State Finances: A Study Provisional Actuals ; BE: Budget Estimates Note: States include 29 states and 2 Union Territories with legislatures.*Data on GFD and Revenue Deficit for 2019-20(PA) for all states has been estimated by RBI by using accounts figures of 24 states available with CAG and 2019-20 BE figures for the remaining 7 states/UTs ; Data for Debt- to-GDP for 2019-20 is Revised Estimates. 2.46 The RBI Study on State Finances highlights the decline in actual capital spending relative to BE observed in the states for the last 3 years (2017-18 Actuals, 2018-19 Actuals and 2019- 20PA). This may have adverse implications for the pace and quality of economic development, given the high fiscal multiplier effect of capital expenditure. In fact in the current year, when the states are dealing with the pandemic with a constrained fiscal space, capital expenditure can play a pivotal role in the recovery process. In order to re-orient the focus of the States' fiscal policy on capital expenditure, Central Government has announced Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Expenditure during FY2021, which has been discussed in Box 7.

However, for the year 2020-21, in view of the unprecedented COVID-19, additional borrowing limit of up to 2 percent of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) was allowed to the States, of which 1% was conditional on state-level reform implementation. Several steps taken by the Central Government to support the State Governments towards a faster economic recovery amidst the COVID-19 pandemic may be seen in Box 4. Box 4: Measures taken by the Centre to support the States in times of COVID-19 The Central Government has taken consistent steps to impart unflinching support to the States in the challenging times of the pandemic. These measures are as follows: 1. Enhanced limit of borrowing for FY2020-21 under Atma Nirbhar Bharat package Under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat package, additional borrowing limit of up to 2 percent of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) was allowed to the States, which was equivalent to ` 4.27 lakh crore. Of the additional 2 per cent borrowing allowed to the States, the first instalment of 0.5 per cent borrowing was untied for all the states. The second part amounting to 1 per cent of GSDP was subject to implementation of following four specific State level reforms, where weightage of each reform is 0.25 per cent of GSDP:- a) Implementation of One Nation One Ration Card System; b) Ease of doing business reform; c) Urban Local body/ utility reforms; and d) Power Sector reforms The final 0.5 per cent borrowing was conditional on undertaking at least 3 out of the above mentioned reforms. As on 30 December 2020, 10 States have implemented the One Nation One Ration Card System, 7 States have completed the stipulated reforms in the Ease of Doing B usiness, and 2 States have done local body reforms. Total additional borrowing permission issued so far to the States who have done the reforms stands at ` 51,682 crore. 2. Compensation to the States for loss in GST revenue In order to compensate the states for the loss of GST revenue during FY 2020-21, Central Government had given the states an option to either borrow the shortfall arising out of GST implementation through issue of debt under a Special Window coordinated by the Ministry of Finance which was passed on to the States and UTs (Option 1), or raise the entire shortfall through the issue of market debt (Option 2). All the 28 states and 3 UTs with legislature decided to go for option 1 which involves back-to-back borrowing coordinated by the Ministry of Finance, and would ensure steady flow of resources similar to the flow under GST79 Fiscal Developments compensation. The specia l window of ` 1.1 lakh crore has been operationalised since 23rd October, 2020 and the Government of India has already borrowed an amount of ` 54,000 crore on behalf of the States in five instalments and passed it on to the States and UT s. Under the terms of Option 1, the states are also entitled to get unconditional permission to borrow the final instalment of 0.5 per cent of GSDP out of the 2% additional borrowing permitted for FY 2020-21. This amounts to an additional mobilization of ` 1.07 lakh crore, over and above the ` 1.1 lakh crore special window to meet the revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation. In addition to this, the States on selecting Option 1, will also be able to carry forward unutilised extra borrowing ceilings allowed for FY 2020-21 to the next financial year, whereby the first and the final instalments of 0.5 per cent each can be carried forward unconditionally; and the reform-linked portions can be carried forward if the States meet the reform criteria within the dates already prescribed for this year. With a view to protecting the states from the higher borrowing costs, Centre will endeavour to keep the cost at or close to the G-sec yield for the special borrowing window, and in the event of the cost being higher, it will bear the margin between G-secs and average of State Development Loan yields, of up to 50 bps, through a subsidy. The interest on the borrowing under the Special Window will be paid from the Compensation Cess as and when it arises until the end of the transition period. After the transition period, principal and interest will also be paid from proceeds of the Cess, by extending the Cess beyond the transition period for such period as may be required. The State will not be required to service the debt or to repay it from any other source. 3. Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Expenditure During the year 2020-21, considering the fiscal environment faced by the State Governments due to the shortfall in tax revenues arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, 'Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Expenditure', has been approved wherein special assistance is being provided to the State Governments in the form of 50-year interest free loan up to an overall sum not exceeding ` 12,000 crore. The Scheme comprises of ` 1600 crore loan for the eight North East states (200 crore each), ` 900 crore loan for the states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh (` 450 crore each), ` 7,500 crore for remaining states (as per 15th Finance Commission devolution), and ` 2,000 crore for those states which fulfil at least 3 out of 4 reforms mentioned under enhanced borrowing provision in Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Package. The loan amount can be used for new or ongoing capital projects needing funds and/ or settling contractors'/ suppliers' bills on such projects. As on 12 December 2020, capital expenditure projects worth ` 9,879.61 crore for 27 states were approved and an amount of ` 4,939.81 crore had been released as first instalment under the scheme. 4. SDRF The Central Government by way of a special one-time dispensation had decided to treat COVID-19 as a notified disaster for the purpose of providing ass istance under SDRF. To80 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 strengthen the States to deal with the pandemic, the Centre had released the 1st instalment of SDRF amounting to ` 11,092 crore to State Governments in April 2020. In September 2020, the states' limit for spending the SDRF during FY 2020-21 was raised to 50%, in order to support them in containment measures of COVID-19 including measures for quarantine, sample collection and screening; and procurement of essential equipment/ labs for response to COVID-19. Source: PIB General Government Finances 2.49 The General Government finances give an overview of fiscal position of the Government sector as a whole. Figure 13 sh ows the trends in General Government debt and deficits over the past few years. The General Government liabilities as a proportion of GDP exhibit an increasing trend over the last few years. In 2020-21 BE, the General Government had budgeted for a reduction in deficit in over 2019-20 RE. However in the wake of the global pandemic outbreak, the General Government (Centre plus States) is expected to register a fiscal slippage on account of the shortfall in revenue and higher expenditure requirements. As indicated by the enhanced borrowing provisions for both the Centre and the States for 2020-21, the liabilities of the General Government are expected to increase. This deviation from the path of fiscal consolidation may however be transient as the fiscal indicators may rebound with the recovery in the economy. The medium and long term trajectory of Government debt will depend on the debt sustainability calculations. A more negative interest-rate growth differential lays the foundation for lower General Government debt as a proportion of GDP (Table 13). Detailed discussion on the dynamics of debt sustainability may be seen in Chapter 2 of V olume 1. Table 13: Trends in Interest rate-growth differential and General Government Debt-to-GDP Year Nominal Interest Rate (i)Nominal Growth rate Note:Nominal interest rate is the weighted average interest rate on Central Government dated securities81 Fiscal Developments Figure 17: Trends in General Government Debt and Deficits (as a per cent of GDP) 6.9 5.8 GDPPer cent of GDP Gross Fiscal Deficit Gross Revenue Deficit Outstanding liabilities of General Government (RHS) Source: RBI Handbook of Statistics RE: Revised EstimatesFor 2019-20 RE, 2019-20 Provisional Estimate of GDP i.e. ` 20339849 has been used OUTLOOK 2.50 The year 2020-21 has been a difficult year from the fiscal perspective. Based on the trends available for April to November 2020, there is likely to be a fiscal slippage during the year. The fiscal policy response of the Government has been a combination of demand and supply side policies under the ambit of 'Atma Nirbhar Bharat' to cushion against the pandemic shock, and subsequently fuel the economic recovery. Going forward, in order to sustain the recovery in aggregate demand, it is expected that the Government may have to continue with an expansionary fiscal stance. The expenditure support along with the various key reforms introduced during the year are likely to impart the required momentum to medium-term growth. The calibrated approach adopted by India allows space for maintaining a fiscal impulse the coming year. The growth recovery would facilitate buoyant revenue collections in the medium term, and thereby enable a sustainable fiscal path. Moreover the release of XV Finance Commission report in the coming months, will lay down the roadmap for the long-term fiscal policy strategy for both the Centre and the States. CHAPTER AT A GLANCE \u00beTo facilitate a resilient recovery of the economy from the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, Government of India adopted a calibrated approach best suited for the evolving situation of the economy in contrast with a front-loaded large stimulus package adopted by many countries. \u00beThe expenditure policy in 2020-21 changed according to the needs of an evolving situation. It was initially aimed at supporting the vulnerable sections but once the lockdown was unwound, it was re-oriented to reinflating overall demand through capital spending.82 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 \u00beOwing to the recovery of the economy over the past few months, the monthly revenue collections have witnessed an uptick. The monthly GST collections have crossed the ` 1 lakh crore mark consecutively for the last 3 months, reaching its' highest ever in December 2020. \u00beReforms in tax administration have set in motion a process of transparency, accountability and more importantly, enhancing the experience of a tax-payer with the tax authority, thereby incentivising tax compliance. \u00beDuring 2020-21, the Central Government has taken consistent steps to impart support to the States in the challenging times of the pandemic. \u00beIn the wake of the global pandemic outbreak, the General Government (Centre plus States) is expected to register a fiscal slippage in FY 2020-21, on account of the shortfall in revenue and higher expenditure requirements. However, longer term sustainability depends crucially on reviving growth relative to the interest cost of Government debt.83 Fiscal Developments ANNEX Annex 1: CBDT's response to COVID-19 pandemic during 2020-21 In view of the challenges faced by taxpayers in meeting the statutory and regulatory compliance requirements across sectors due to the outbreak of Novel Corona Virus (COVID-19), the Government of India has taken following measures pertaining to direct taxes to support businesses and individuals: (i) The T axation and Other Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Act, 2020 has been enacted under which:(a) Various time limits for compliances and statutory actions under the taxation laws, other related legislations and the rules or notifications prescribed/ issued under these Acts have been extended; (b) Interest for delay in payment of income-tax (e.g. advance tax, TDS, TCS), Equalization Levy, Securities Transaction Tax (STT), Commodities Transaction Tax (CTT) due for payment from 20.03.2020 to 29.06.2020 to be charged at reduced rate of 9% per annum (0.75% per month), if the payment is paid by 30.06.2020.

Annex 3: Initiatives undertaken by the Ministry of Defence for utilization of defence expenditure and promoting self-reliance in the defence sector. Budget performance The allocation of Defence Budget including Civil estimates and Pensions for 2020-21 is ` 4,71,378.00 crore, which is ` 40,367.71 crore over BE 2019-20. Capital Expenditure in absolute terms has gone up in the past few years. The allocated Capital budget has been fully utilized since 2016-17, reversing the previous trends of surrender of funds. The trend of underutilization of Defence Budget has also been reversed from FY 2016-17. Defence Acquisition Procedure (DAP) -2020: Ministry of Defence unveiled the Defence Acquisition Procedure (DAP)-2020 on 28th September, 2020. DAP-2020 has been aligned with the vision of the Government's Atma Nirbhar Bharat and empowering Indian domestic industry through Make in India initiative with the ultimate aim of turning India into a global manufacturing hub. With the new Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy announced, DAP 2020 has adequately included provisions to encourage FDI to establish manufacturing hubs both for import substitution and exports while protecting interests of Indian domestic industry. Some of the specific reforms enunciated in Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, are as under: a) Notify a List of W eapons/Platforms for Ban on Import: Relevant incorporation has been done in the DAP to ensure that NO equipment as mentioned in the list is procured ex import post timelines notified. b) Indigenization of Imported Spares: i. Request for Information (RFI)- RFI stage will explore willingness of the prospective foreign vendors to progressively undertake manufacture and set up and indigenous eco system at the spares/ sub component level. ii. New Category of Buy (Global- Manufacture in India)- The new category incorporates manufacture of either the entire/part of the equipment or spares/assemblies/sub-assemblies/Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility for the equipment, through its subsidiary in India. iii. Co-production through IGA (Inter Government Agreement)- This enables establishment of co-production facilities through IGA achieving 'Import Substitution' and reduce Life Cycle Cost. 88 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 iv. Contr actual Enablement. Buyer's Right to optimize Life Cycle Support costs and system enhancements through indigenous eco system incorporated. c) FDI in Defence Manufacturing: With the announcement of new FDI Policy, suitable provisions have been incorporated like new category 'Buy (Global - Manufacture in India)' done to encourage foreign OEMs to setup 'manufacturing/ maintenance entities' through its subsidiary in India while enabling requisite protections to domestic industry. d) Time Bound Defence Procurement Process and Faster Decision Making: As part of the Defence Reforms announced in Atma Nirbhar Abhiyan, setting up of a PMU has been mandated to support contract management. The PMU will facilitate obtaining advisory and consultancy support in specified areas to streamline Acquisition process. Ease of Doing Business: One of the key focus areas of the review was to implement 'Ease of Doing Business' with emphasis on simplification, delegation and making the process industry friendly with certain specific provisions like Single stage accord of AoN in all cases up to ` 500 crore to reduce time. Make and Innovation: a) Make I (Government Funded up to 70%)- Laying down a cap of ` 250 crore /DA and selection of DAs based on bidding criteria. b) Make II (Industry Funded) for production of indigenously designed & developed weapons/equipment/systems/platforms along with sub components/assemblies. c) Make III (Indigenously Manufactured) category for manufacture of equipment/ platforms or spares/assemblies/sub-assemblies for enabling import substitution. d) Procurement of prototypes developed through 'Innovation' under various initiatives like iDEX, Technology Development Fund and Internal Services Organisations has been facilitated. Offsets: The Offset guidelines have been revised, wherein preference will be given to manufacture of complete defence products over components and various multipliers have been added to give incentivisation in discharge of Offsets. Self- Reliance in Defence Production: To achieve self-reliance in the defence sector and make India a global hub in defence manufacturing the Ordnance Factories (OFs), Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs) and the private industry ecosystem have enhanced their capabilities and widened the product range. A large number of major products have been developed through R&D initiatives and through transfer of technology. As a policy, DPSUs and OFs have been outsourcing many of their requirement, the value of outsourcing in terms of value of production for the FY 2019-20 stands at 41.70%. Further over the years a wide vendor base has been developed that includes a large number of medium and small scale enterprises and large scale industries. In addition, the DPSUs and OFs are also striving to increase the indigenous content in the equipment's and products manufactured by them. The indigenous content (Degree of Indigenization) as on 31.03.2020 was 74.56%.89 Fiscal Developments Policy Initiative Under the latest Preference to Public Procurement (Make in India) Order 2017, Department of Defence Production has notified list of 46 items for which there is sufficient local capacity and competition and thus, the procurement of these items shall be done only from local suppliers, irrespective of the purchase value The innovation ecosystem for Defence tilted \"Innovation for Defence Excellence\" (iDEX), launched in 2018, intends to engage industries including MSMEs, Start-ups, Individual Innovators, R&D institutes and Academia and provide them grants/funding and other support to carry out R&D, which has potential for future adoption for Indian defence and aerospace needs. Defence Investor Cell functional since January 2018 under DDP is playing a pivotal role of facilitator and guide to Defence entrepreneurs regarding their queries/grievances. It has addressed more than 1000 such queries/cases from across the country. Private sector Participation In May 2001, the Defence Industry sector, which was hitherto reserved for the public sector, was opened up to 100 per cent for Indian private sector participation with Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) up to 26 per cent, both subject to licensing. FDI policy was further liberalized vide Press Note no. 4(2020 Series) dated 17.09.2020 and FDI has been allowed under automatic route up to 74% and above 74% through government route wherever it is likely to result in access to modern technology or for other reasons to be recorded. Foreign Investments in the Defence Sector shall be subject to scrutiny on grounds of Nations Security and Government reserves the right to review any foreign investment in the Defence Sector that affects or may affect national security. After opening of the Defence Industry Sector for private sector participation, so far 44 FDI proposals/Joint Ventures have been approved in defence sector for manufacture of various defence equipment, both in public and private sectors. DPIIT has issued 496 Industrial Licenses (ILs) to private companies till September 2020 for manufacture of a wide range of defence items. Export Promotion Exports from Ordnance Factory Board (OFB), DPSUs and the private sector (based on authorization issued by DDP) in the Financial Year have increased from ` 4,682 crore in FY2017-18 to ` 9116 crore in FY2019-20. In order to encourage participation of private sector in indigenous design, development and manufacture of Defence equipment, 'Make' Procedure has been further simplified and incorporated as Chapter-III of Defence Acquisition Procedure 2020 w.e.f 01.10.2020. Apart from \"Make-I & Make-II' categories, a new category 'Make-III' has been introduced with an objective to get the defence items already in the inventory of Service, manufactured in the country even if the design & development is not carried out in India. Framework for implementation on 'Make-II' procedure at Ordnance Factories and Defence PSUs was also issued in February 2019 enabling them to take up indigenisation of the items, particularly of import substitution nature, through Indian private industryCHAPTER03 External Sector The air that blows off a small lamp becomes the friend of a jungle fire! Power garners support! - Subha shita COVID-19 pandemic has triggered the worst global recession in 2020 since the Great Depression; the adverse economic impact is, however, expected to be lesser than initially feared. The resulting economic crisis has led to a sharp decline in global trade, lower commodity prices and tighter external financing conditions with varying implications for current account balances and currencies of different countries. Global merchandise trade is expected to contract by 9.2 per cent in 2020. Trade balance with China and the US improved as imports contracted. The changing nature of India' s global trade manifested in terms of sliding exports of gems and jewellery, engineering goods, textile and allied products and improving exports of drugs and pharma, software and agriculture and allied products. Pharma exports, in particular, used this opportunity to enhance their share in total India' s exports and indicate India' s potential to be the pharmacy of the world. Supported by resilient software service exports, India is expected to witness a current account surplus during the current financial year after a gap of 17 years. Balance on the capital account, on the other hand, is buttressed by robust FDI and FPI inflows. These developments have led to accretion of foreign exchange reserves that rose to an all-time high of US$ 586.1 billion as on January 8, 2021. RBI' s interventions in forex market have been largely successful in controlling the volatility and one-sided appreciation of the rupee. High levels of headline inflation, however, posits the classical trilemma before RBI to maintain a fine balance between tightening of monetary policy to control inflation on the one hand and stimulate growth on the other hand. Against the aforesaid backdrop, various initiatives undertaken to promote exports, including Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme, Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP), emphasis on improvement of trade logistics infrastructure and use of digital initiatives would go a long way in enabling 'ease of doing External Sector 3.1 COVID-19 has affected nearly all spheres of the global economy with the spread catalyzed by the increasing interconnectedness of global value chains. The resulting crisis has constituted an intense shock, with a sharp decline in global trade, lower commodity prices, tighter external financing conditions and with varying implications for current account balances and currencies. The global volume of goods trade in the first five months of 2020 was about 20 per cent lower than in 2019\u2014a more abrupt contraction than in the first five months of the global financial crisis. GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT 3.2 The spread of the pandemic led to associated suspension of economic activities, supply-chain disruptions, travel restrictions and volatility in international commodity prices. As a result, there was a wave of downward revisions to global output growth and trade volume.The contraction in GDP has been much stronger in the current recession when compared to the fall in trade which has been more moderate. World Trade Organization (WTO), in April 2020, predicted a fall in world merchandise trade by 13-32 per cent in 2020. However, with easing of lockdowns and acceleration in economic activity, a surge in trade was recorded in the months of June and July. WTO, accordingly, revised its forecast in October 2020 to a decline of 9.2 per cent in the volume of world merchandise trade in 2020, followed by a 7.2 per cent rise in 2021 (Figure 1). In the October 2020 edition of the World Economic Outlook, the IMF expected a sharper fall in world output of 4.4 per cent in 2020, but lower contraction in world trade volume of 10.4 per cent in 2020 as against 3.0 per cent and 11.0 per cent respectively predicted in April 2020 (Figure 1). In advanced economies (AEs), the contraction for GDP as well as trade volume is projected to be more severe than for the emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs). Figure 1:Trends in Growth of World Output and Trade Volume -4.4 -10.48.3 -9.27.2 -12-10-8-6-4-20246810 -15-10-50510 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Annual Per cent ChangeAnnual Per cent ChangeWorld Output (IMF) World Trade Volume in Goods and Services (IMF) World Merchandise Trade Volume (WTO)-RhS Source: International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organization (WTO) Note: Figures for 2020 and 2021 are projections indicated as shaded portion. 3.3 Global merchandise trade, as per data available from WTO, recorded its sharpest ever one- period decline in Q2-2020. The WTO's goods trade barometer index for the said quarter was at 84.5 - the lowest on record since 2007 - i.e., 15.5 points below the baseline value of 100 for 92 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 the index and 18.6 points down from the same period last year.1 However, it improved to 100.7 in September, 2020, indicating a strong rebound in trade in the third quarter as lockdowns were eased, broadly consistent with the WTO's October trade forecast. 3.4 The impact on trade differed significantly across regions. In 2020 (upto Q3), AEs suffered the steepest decline in exports by 12.9 per cent and imports by 10.8 per cent, while EMDEs witnessed lower contraction in exports by 7.6 per cent and in imports by 10.1 per cent. Among the EMDEs, South East Asian export-oriented countries witnessed still lower shrinkage of exports by 2.4 per cent and imports by 9.6 per cent.This can be attributed to the impressive export performance of few countries such as Vietnam, Taiwan, and Malaysia, and their continuous narrowing contraction in imports in subsequent quarters (Figure 2). Figure 2:Trends in World Merchandise Trade Exports Imports -40-30-20-100102030 World Advanced EconomiesEMDEs SE Asia IndiaGrowth rate (Y -o-Y), Per cent 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 (Upto Q3) -25-20-15-10-505101520 World Advanced EconomiesEMDEs SE Asia IndiaGrowth rate (Y -o-Y), Per cent 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 (Upto Q3) Source: WTO 3.5 The impact on trade also varied significantly across different types of goods. While trade in agricultural products fell less than the world average in the second quarter of 2020 (-5 per cent versus -21 per cent), it fell precipitously for fuels and mining products ( -38 per cent) as prices collapsed. Further, the trade in automotive products recorded the biggest decline, though, it rose for telecommunication equipment (which includes smartphones), electronics (to facilitate working from home), and pharmaceuticals. 3.6 As per IMF's October Global Financial Stability Report 2020, near-term global financial stability risks have been contained for now due to the unprecedented and timely policy responses to maintain the flow of credit to the economy and avoided adverse macro-financial feedback loops, thereby creating a bridge to recovery. However, vulnerabilities have increased in the non-financial corporate sector, as firms have taken on more debt to cope with cash shortages and in the sovereign sector, as fiscal deficits have widened to support the economy. EMDEs rely primarily on commodity exports, remittances and tourism for forex earnings, all of which plummeted as the pandemic unfolded. However, its impact on EMDEs so far has been milder than expected as just six countries - Argentina, Ecuador, Belize, Lebanon, Suriname and Zambia - have defaulted on their sovereign debt and only the first two restructured their debts. Potential debt defaults could ensue in 2021 as a large amount of foreign debt is estimated to be due for repayment in that year. The future path of defaults will ultimately be shaped by the extent of continued policy support and 1WTO's goods trade barometer index is a leading indicator that signals changes in world trade growth two to three months ahead of merchandise trade volume statistics. Its baseline value is 100, a value greater than 100 suggests above-trend growth while a value below 100 indicates below-trend growth.93 External Sector the pace of the recovery, which is expected to be uneven across sectors and countries. 3.7 In sum, the global economy is still reeling under the impact of the unprecedented COVID-19 shock. Amidst this uncertain and shaky global economic environment, India's external sector has emerged as a key cushion for resilience. The comfortable external balance position of India has been supported by surplus current account balances over three consecutive quarters, resumption of portfolio capital inflows, robust FDI inflows and sustained build-up of foreign exchange reserves. DEVELOPMENTS IN INDIA'S BALANCE OF PAYMENTS (BOP) Merchandise Trade 3.8 During Q1: FY 2020-21, India's exports and imports saw a sharp contraction in line with the contraction in global trade. The decline in imports outweighed that in exports - leading to smaller trade deficit of US$ 9.8 billion as compared to US$ 49.2 billion in Q1 last year. India registered a trade surplus in the month of June, 2020 after a gap of 18 years. With the unlocking of the economy from June onwards, a gradual revival in India's merchandise trade got underway (Figure 3). The trade deficit during the April-December, 2020-21 was US$ 57.5 billion as compared to US$ 125.9 billion in the corresponding period last year .

Petroleum, Oil and Lubricants (POL) exports, which constitute about 10-15 per cent of the total exports, have contributed negatively to export performance during the period under review. The fall in POL exports was largely driven by the softening of international crude oil prices, which plunged in Q1: FY 2020-21 by (-) 54.0 per cent and remain muted by (-) 28.7 per cent by Q3: FY 2020-21 as compared to last year. On the other hand, Non-POL exports, which contributed significantly to the shrinkage of exports in Q1 of 2020-21, turned positive and helped in improving export performance in Q3 (Figure 4). Within Non-POL exports, agriculture & allied products, drugs &pharmaceutical and ores & minerals proved resilient and recorded expansion. However, key commodities such as organic and inorganic chemicals, electronic goods, textiles & allied products, engineering products, gems and jewellery pulled export growth down (Figure 5).96 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Figure 4: Relative POL Exports Total Exports (RhS) World Exports (RhS) Source: Survey calculations based on data of DoC and WTO Figure 5: Relative Contribution in Non-POL Exports Per centage Points Source: Survey calculations based on data of DoC 3.12 Drug formulations, biologicals have consistently registered positive growth and highest increase in absolute terms in recent months. This led to rise in its share to 7.1 per cent in April- November, 2020 from 5.0 per cent in April-November, 2019, making it the second largest exported commodity among the top 10 export commodities (Figure 6). This shows that India has the potential to be the 'pharmacy of the world' (Box 1). Iron and Steel is another commodity whose share has increased from 3.0 per cent to 4.4 per cent in the said period. However, the pandemic-related disruptions led to sharp fall in exports of Motor Vehicles/ Cars as it no longer figures among the top 10 exported commodities in April-November, 2020.97 External Sector Figure 6: Top 10 Export Commodities in April-November 2020 and April-November 2019 [By Share in Per cent] 13.5 5.0 7.03.02.82.72.34.52.62.58.8 7.1 5.54.42.92.82.32.32.22.2 Petroleum Products Drug Formulations, Biologicals Pearl, Precious, Semiprecious Stones Iron And Steel Electric Machinery AndEquipment Organic Chemicals Marine Products Gold and other precious metal jewellery RMG Cotton incl.

India almost doubled its share in world pharma exports in a span of ten years from 1.4 per cent in 2010 to 2.6 per cent in 2019.

However, in a cross-country perspective, India's revealed comparative advantage (RCA) stands at 12 th spot (Figure B1.1). In addition, Indian pharmaceutical sector has high value of trade specialization coefficient (TSC), closer to one, consistently from 2014-15. The value of TSC lies between -1 and 1, wherein a higher TSC value denotes stronger export competitiveness of the country.

Against this backdrop, the Indian pharmaceutical industry is currently valued at US$ 41 billion and is expected to grow to US$ 65 billion by 2024 and about US$ 120-130 billion by 2030. A significant raw material base and availability of a skilled workforce have enabled India to emerge as an international manufacturing hub for generic medicines. Further, India is the only country with largest number of US-FDA compliant pharma plants (more than 262 including APIs) outside of USA. COVID-19 has presented both an opportunity and a challenge for India to emerge as the 'pharmacy of the world'. During April-October, 2020, India's pharmaceutical exports totaling US$ 11.1 billion witnessed an impressive growth of 18.0 per cent, as against US$ 9.4 billion during the corresponding period a year ago. This has led to an increase in the share of pharmaceuticals exports in India's total exports from 5.1 per cent in April-October, 2019 to 7.3 per cent in April-October, 2020, making it the third largest exported commodity. The commitment of provision of COVID-19 vaccine to other countries has made India the epicentre for its manufacturing. According to data available from US-FDA, Indian pharma companies have garnered nearly 45 per cent of all new abbreviated new drug application (ANDAs) approvals over the past nine months, which would aid exports growth in the coming years. The pandemic, however, exposed the excessive dependence of Indian pharmaceutical industry on China for sourcing Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and Key Starting Materials (KSMs). Further, there is a disproportionate dependence of Indian pharma exports on USA and generics. To get over this challenge, pharmaceuticals drugs have been identified as one of the ten key sectors for introducing Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for enhancing India's manufacturing capabilities and exports. This is in addition to the already notified PLI schemes for bulk drugs and medical devices, which aim to provide a boost to domestic manufacturing for critical KSMs/ Drug Intermediates (DIs), APIs and medical devices. Both these schemes have received a very encouraging response from the pharmaceutical as well as the medical device industry. Further, a scheme for promotion of bulk drug parks and medical devices parks have also been announced. Indian Pharma needs to rise to the golden opportunity presented by the pandemic and emerge as the 'pharmacy of the world'. A well-defined strategy for broad based development of the industry needs to include the following components: i. Broaden base in terms of markets, as well as product categories: Pursuing opportunities in newer product classes such as biosimilars, gene therapy and specialty drugs and increasing exports to large and traditionally underpenetrated markets such as Japan, China, Africa, Indonesia, Russia/CIS countries, Brazil and Latin America, can usher-in the next leg of growth for Indian pharma industry. ii. Restructure the curr ent regulatory mechanism and upgrade and build capacities at various National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPERs). iii. Greater R&D Expenditure to move up the value chain from generics to Novel Chemical Entities (NCEs).99 External Sector 3.13 In so far as the top export destinations are concerned, USA continues to be the largest export market for India in April-November, 2020, while China has occupied the 2nd position, moving up from 3rd spot in April-November, 2019. Exports to China in April-November, 2020 constitute around 7.8 per cent vis-\u00e0-vis 5.4 per cent in April-November, 2019 (Figure 7). Malaysia is a new entrant among the top 10 export destinations, as compared to last year, while Nepal no longer occupies position among the top 10 destinations.

While the total merchandise imports contracted sharply in Q1 of 2020-21 by (-) 52.9 per cent, the pace of contraction eased in Q2 and Q3 to (-) 23.2 per cent and (-) 8.3 per cent, respectively. This recovery in imports was contributed by accelerating positive growth in gold and silver imports and narrowing contraction in non-POL, non-gold & silver imports. Gold & silver imports, constituting about 7-9 per cent of India's imports, witnessed a sharp growth of 33.0 per cent in Q3 of 2020-21 to US$ 10.0 billion - primarily due to the simultaneous rise in international gold and silver prices on account of demand for bullion as safe haven. Fertilizers, vegetable oil, drugs & pharmaceuticals and computer hardware & peripherals have contributed positively to the growth of non-POL, non-Gold & Silver imports, while capital goods contributed most to its weakness (Figure 9).

As a result, Bangladesh witnessed its share in world exports increase from 0.1 per cent in 2011 to 0.3 per cent in 2019. The top five export commodities, account for more than 90 per cent of total exports of Bangladesh since 2015. These five commodities mainly pertain to textiles & apparels and footwear industry, which are highly labour-intensive and employs unskilled and semi-skilled labour (Figure B2.1). In case of India, on the other hand, export performance is more broad-based as the top five export commodities jointly contribute around 40 per cent of total exports (Figure B2.2) and these commodities are capital and technology-intensive.

Four of these commodities are also among the top five export commodities (in terms of share and value) of Bangladesh. This underscores that Bangladesh exports those commodities in which it has competitive advantage.

However, none of the export commodities in which India has highest RCA is among the top export commodities (in terms of share and value) (Figure B2.4).

This pattern was also examined in Chapter 5, Economic Survey, 2019-20 wherein it was shown that high diversification combined with low specialization implied that India is spreading its exports thinly over many products and partners. Invisibles 3.17 Net services receipts amounting to US$ 41.7 billion remained stable in April-September, 2020 as compared with US$ 40.5 billion in corresponding period a year ago, notwithstanding a sharp contraction in travel receipts owing to the international mobility restrictions imposed at the onset of the pandemic and falling remittances (Figure 12a). Resilience of the services sector was primarily driven by software services, which accounted for 49 per cent of total services exports (Figure 12b). Figure 12b: Composition of Export (RhS) Services Import (RhS) Source: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) 3.18 Net private transfer receipts, mainly representing remittances by Indians employed overseas, totaling US$ 35.8 billion in H1: FY 2020-21 declined by 6.7 per cent over the corresponding period of previous year. It is pertinent to note that as per the World Migration Report 2020, 105 External Sector India has the largest number of migrants living abroad (17.5 million) and was the top recipient of remittances of US$ 83.3 billion in 2019. However, as per World Bank, remittance flows to low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are estimated to decline in 2020, by around 7.2 per cent. For India, remittances are projected to fall by about 8.9 per cent to US$ 76 billion in 2020. Net outgo due to cross border income payments associated with the production and ownership of financial and other non-produced assets, which had been moving upward since 2011-12, declined in 2019-20. In H1: FY 2020-21, there was a net outflow of primary income of US$ 16.8 billion as against outflow of US$14.7 billion in corresponding period a year ago. Current Account of BOP 3.19 India's current account deficit averaged 2.2 per cent of GDP in the last 10 years. Reversing this trend, current account balance turned into surplus (0.1 per cent of GDP) in Q4: FY 2019-20 on the back of, among others, a lower trade deficit and a sharp rise in net invisible receipts. This quarterly surplus was registered after a gap of 13 years after Q4: FY 2006-07. This has been followed by successive current account surpluses in Q1 and Q2 of FY 2020-21. In H1: FY 2020-21, steep contraction in merchandise imports and lower outgo for travel services led to a sharper fall in current payments (by 30.8 per cent) than current receipts (15.1 per cent) - leading to a current account surplus of US$ 34.7 billion (3.1 per cent of GDP) (Figure 13). Given the trend in imports of both goods and services, it is expected that India will end with an annual current account surplus of atleast 2 per cent of GDP - after a period of 17 years. Figure 13: Composition of Current of GDP US$ Billion Net Merchandise Trade Balance Net Services Net Transfers Net Income CAB to GDP ratio (RhS) Source: RBI Capital/ Financial account of BOP 3.20 Net capital flows was modest in H1: FY 2020-21 at US$ 16.5 billion, as against US$ 40.0 billion in HI: FY 2019-20, mainly accounted for by net repayments of external commercial borrowings (ECBs) and decline in banking capital. However, there is an increase in net foreign investment to US$ 31.4 billion in H1: FY 2020-21, vis-\u00e0-vis US$ 28.7 billion in corresponding period a year ago. 3.21 During April-October , 2020, net FDI flows recorded an inflow of US$ 27.5 billion, 14.8 per cent higher as compared to first seven months of 2019-20, an endorsement of India's status as a preferred investment destination amongst the global investors (Figure 14). As far as sector-wise FDI is concerned, computer software and hardware attracted the highest FDI equity inflows of 106 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 US$ 17.6 billion in April-September, 2020 vis-\u00e0-vis US$ 4.0 billion in April-September, 2019. Singapore continues to be the top investing country, in terms of FDI equity inflows, while US has taken second position, as against being at 4th spot during corresponding period a year ago. Figure 14: Foreign Direct Investment Net FDI to GDP (RhS) Source: RBI Note: The net FDI inflows in Oct 2020 were to the tune of US$ 4.6 billion. 3.22 After unprecedented sell-offs in March 2020 reflecting recessionary fears among global investors at the onset of the pandemic, foreign portfolio investment (FPI) witnessed strong rebound especially in equity inflows, recording net FPI flows of US$ 28.5 billion during April- December, 2020 as against US$ 12.3 billion in corresponding period of last year (Figure 15). Indian equities have been supported by abundant global liquidity, better corporate earnings in subsequent quarters and better management of COVID-19 re-igniting economic recovery prospects. The addition of Indian stocks to Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Global Standard indices has also helped in attracting foreign capital inflows. Figure 15: Foreign Limited (NSDL). Note: Total net FPI is summation of debt, equity, hybrid and VRR, however, only debt and equity are depicted in above chart as they together account for more than 90 per cents of the total net FPI.107 External Sector 3.23 Among other forms of capital flows, banking capital recorded a net outflow of US$ 8.9 billion in H1: FY 2020-21, higher than the net outflow of US$ 5.7 billion, in first half of 2019- 20. With repayments exceeding fresh disbursals, net outflows on ECBs increased to US$ 5.7 billion in April-September, 2020. Net inflow on account of non-resident deposits was US$ 4.9 billion, as against US$ 5.0 billion in April-September, 2019. External Debt 3.24 At end-September 2020, India's external debt was placed at US$ 556.2 billion recording a decrease of US$ 2.0 billion (0.4 per cent) over the level, as at end-March 2020. Excluding the valuation loss, due to the depreciation of the US$ vis-\u00e0-vis major currencies, the decrease in external debt would have been US$ 8.3 billion. ECBs, the largest component of external debt, at US$ 207 billion as at end- September 2020, contracted by 5.8 per cent over the level as at end-March 2020 (Box 3). While the stock of NRI deposits, the second largest component, rose 5.1 per cent to US$ 137.3 billion over the level as at end-March 2020, the (import-financing) trade credit, the third largest component at US$ 99.4 billion shrank by 2.0 per cent. Government debt increased to US$ 103.6 billion from US$ 100.9 billion as at end-March 2020. Box 3: ECBs- Gradual Easing of Policy The outstanding ECBs as at end-September 2020 at US$ 163.8 billion was lower than US$ 164.7 billion, as at end-March 2020. Bulk of the ECBs was in the form of commercial loans and securitized borrowings (91.2 per cent) (Figure B3.1) predominantly denominated in US$ (77.2 per cent) and accessed mainly by non-financial corporations (74.5 per cent). While the average maturity of the ECBs was 6 years, cost of ECBs, as measured by the average of monthly weighted average margin over the reference rate for the loans registered during April-September 2020, at 1.9 per cent was higher than observed in the recent years (Figure B3.2). Export Credit Commercial Loan Securitized Instruments V olume 2 al., 2015; Verma & Prakash, 2011 and Ray et al, 2017) identifies both country-specific idiosyncratic (push) factors as well as generic and global (pull) factors as drivers of ECBs in the Indian context. The country-specific factors include domestic real economic activity, exchange rate, interest rate and inflation, status of domestic corporate bond market, degree of openness in terms of capital account and the regulatory framework. Global financial conditions including rates of interest, global growth and inflation are among the pull factors. Accordingly, the slowdown in the economic activity during H1 of 2020-21, among others, may have caused ebbing of India Inc's appetite for ECBs. The on-going COVID-19 pandemic is expected to adversely impact export earnings of external commercial borrowers. To the extent such earnings are dented, their repayment capacity would potentially get adversely impacted, thereby creating a source of potential vulnerability going forward. As a capital scarce growing economy with large investment needs, it has been India's long- standing policy to encourage capital inflows to augment domestic savings with a bias towards flows that are stable, long term and least prone to sudden stoppages and reversals. Accordingly, the motivation has, inter alia, been to minimize currency risk by mandatory hedging and roll-over risk by stipulating average minimum maturity while enabling firms to access foreign borrowing by fixing a dynamic limit as a ratio to GDP coupled with regulating end-use. This broad paradigm has evolved over the years with a view to promote ease of doing business. As an integral part of this broader endeavour, a new and simplified ECB policy was put in place in March 2019 by removing the scope of arbitrage, creating a level playing field for all eligible borrowers, and widening the base of borrowers and lenders. Further, development of financial markets in India has been accorded due importance to enable the external commercial borrowers to hedge their interest and currency risk. More importantly, in order to address potential system stability risk to other stake holders arising out of individual corporate-borrower vulnerability, the regulatory prescription for incremental provisioning109 External Sector and capital requirements has been in place for banks' exposures to firms with unhedged foreign currency liability. There has been a progressive rationalization and liberalization of the regulations governing the end-use of ECBs with a view to improve ease of doing business, as documented in the Status Report on India's External Debt 2019-20. As per the extant policy effective January 16, 2019, end-use restrictions relating to ECBs have been relaxed for specific eligible borrowers for their working capital requirements, general corporate purposes and repayment of rupee loans. Refinancing is permitted only if the outstanding maturity of the original borrowing (weighted outstanding maturity in case of multiple borrowings) is not reduced and all-in-cost of fresh ECB is lower than the all-in-cost (weighted average cost in case of multiple borrowings) of existing ECB. Further, only highly rated corporates (AAA) and Maharatna/ Navratna public sector undertakings are permitted to participate in refinancing of existing ECBs. ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA), which compiles and oversees the LIBOR, intends that one week and two-month US$ LIBOR settings will cease at end-2021, and that the remaining US$ LIBOR panel will cease at end-June 2023 - 18 months later than was planned. Preliminary estimates suggest that LIBOR-linked ECB/ FCCB exposure in the currencies (USD, GBP, JPY , CHF and EUR) as at end-September 2020 in equivalent US dollar is estimated at US$ 81.8 billion of which, about US$ 57.5 billion of debt contracts in the form of ECB/ FCCB will expire beyond end-December 2021. As is the case globally, financial contracts referencing LIBOR - both loan and derivative contract - which will outlive the cessation will need to be renegotiated to ensure insertion of appropriate fallback language.

However, the ratio of foreign exchange reserves to total and short-term debt (original and residual) improved because of the sizable accretion in reserves. 2 Share of short-term debt (original maturity) in the total stock of external debt, which is an important metric to analyze potential debt vulnerability, has also improved. Reflecting lower current receipts, debt service ratio (principal repayment plus interest payment), however, increased to 9.7 per cent as at end-September 2020 as compared to 6.5 per cent at end-March 2020. 2Short term debt by residual maturity includes short term debt by original maturity as well as long term debt repayment falling due within next twelve months.110 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Table 4: External Debt Vulnerability Indicators (Per cent, unless indicated otherwise) Indicator End-March End- September 2020 P2013 2018 2019 2020 R Total External Debt (US$ billion) 409.4 529.3 543.1 558.2 556.2 External Debt to GDP 22.4 20.1 19.8 20.6 21.6 Short term debt (original maturity) to total debt 23.6 19.3 20 19.1 18.5 Short term debt (residual maturity) to total debt 42.1 42.0 43.4 42.4 44.6 Concessional debt to total debt 11.1 9.1 8.7 8.8 9.0 Reserves to total debt 71.3 80.2 76 85.2 97.4 Ratio of Short-term debt to reserves 33.1 24.1 26.3 22.5 19.0 Short term debt (residual maturity) to reserves 59 52.3 57 49.5 45.5 Debt Service Ratio 5.9 7.5 6.4 6.5 9.7 Source: RBI and Ministry of Finance Note: R: Revised; P: Provisional. Box 4: India's External Debt: Stock-Taking and the Way Forward The total external debt of the world, at US$ 89 trillion as at end-June 2020, grew at lower rate of 1.0 per cent over the level as at-end March 2020 than that (2.2 per cent) registered a quarter ago. 3 The US is the most heavily indebted country in the world with 23.9 per cent of the total external debt stock. India is placed at 23rd position globally with an estimated stock at US$ 554.4 billion as at end-June 2020. Analysis of maturity profile of India's external debt as at end-June 2020 among the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) reporting countries underscores that India's share of short-term debt, at 18.9 per cent, is not only lower than the median share of 24.2 per cent, but also smaller than that of any top 20 debtor countries. Further, among the SDDS and General Data Dissemination Standards (GDDS) countries, India's share of government sector in gross external debt as at end-June 2020 at 18 per cent is modest and lower than the median share of at 29.7 per cent. The theoretical literature suggests a kind of \"Laffer Curve\" relationship between foreign debt and growth: foreign debt has a positive impact on investment and growth up to a certain threshold level; beyond this level, however, its impact turns adverse. Reflecting an element of uncertainty in this non-linear relationship, a range of values for the optimal or growth maximizing level of debt is identified. Cohen (1997) finds that for African and Latin American countries, external debt to GDP of 50 per cent and debt to exports of 200 per cent could be the inflexion point for the non-linearity to kick in. Pattillo, et al (2002, 2011) based on developing and middle-income countries, argue that the average impact of foreign debt becomes negative at about 160-170 per cent of exports or 35-40 per cent of GDP. Benedict et al (2003), on the other hand, find that for low-income countries a threshold level of around 30-37 per cent of GDP, or around 115-120 per cent of exports is optimal. Another stream of literature highlights that countries with good policies and strong institutions tend to have higher thresholds and countries with bad and poor policies and weak institutions have lower thresholds (Cordella et at, 2010). The most well-known 3Including countries reporting under Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) and General Data Dissemination Standards (GDDS).111 External Sector channel flagged in the literature through which the external debt impacts growth adversely is the so-called Debt Overhang: in the likelihood of future debt being larger than the countries repayment ability, then, expected debt service will be increasingly pre-empting the country's output levels, leading to returns on investments becoming poor and thereby discouraging the new domestic and foreign investments and also eroding the quality of investments. The India's external debt to GDP ratio has been well below the optimal zone over the years as it came down from 38.7 per cent as at end-March 1992 to as low as 17.1 per cent as at end-March 2006 (Figure B4.1). 4 It remained range-bound around 23 per cent during early 2010s. It is estimated at 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020. Barring China, leading emerging market economies have higher ratio than India's. India's external debt to exports ratio dropped secularly downwards since the crisis year 1992, though it has climbed up in the recent years and is now hovering in the close vicinity of the optimal zone (Figure B4.2). It needs to be remembered that the optimal zone indicates growth maximising compatible with the long-run framework of steady state.

Overall BOP 3.26 India, being a developing and emerging market economy, typically runs a deficit on the current account to supplement domestic savings with foreign savings to fund higher investment. The current account deficit is usually financed by a capital account surplus. However, since Q4: FY 2019-20, India has been experiencing a current account surplus along with robust capital inflows leading to a BoP surplus (Figure 16).

In the months following the outbreak of the pandemic, India experienced unprecedented FPI outflows of US$ 15.92 billion in March 2020, after recording cumulative inflows of US$ 1.42 billion in January 2020 and February 2020, with high volatility in the INR. RBI deployed several conventional and unconventional tools in order to ensure financial stability and orderly conditions in financial markets and has been largely successful in controlling the volatility in the ` (Figure 18). Large stimulus by central banks in advanced economies has resulted in heightened capital flows into emerging markets such as India, causing asset price inflation as well as stronger local currencies. Judicious interventions in forex markets were, therefore, required to prevent a large one-sided appreciation in the rupee - as has been done by RBI (Figure 18).114 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Figure 18: FPI flows (RhS)Volatility in Indian ` FPI flows and Exchange rate Source: RBI Foreign Exchange Reserves 3.30 While improved current account balance has been a key factor for reserve accretion in H1 of 2020-21, robust capital flows, particularly FDI and FPI, in subsequent months largely drove foreign exchange reserves to an all-time high of US$ 586.1 billion as on January 8, 2021, covering about 18 months of imports (Figure 19). As at end-September 2020, India is the fifth largest foreign exchange reserves holder among all countries of the world after China, Japan, Switzerland and Russia. India's international financial liabilities are 210.7 per cent of foreign exchange reserves as at end-September 2020 as compared with 229.7 per cent as at end-March 2020. Figure 19: Sources of Foreign Exchange Reserves Cover (RhS) Source: Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Note: (i) The forex reserves indicated above are as at end date of the quarter.(ii) The reserve cover of imports for Q3 2020-21 is provisional and based on annualised imports of Q2 of 2020-21. It will change once quarterly BoP is released. 3.31 This forex reserve accretion entailed a concomitant release of domestic liquidity and aided the large-scale government borrowing without entailing any implications for monetary policy as 115 External Sector long as inflation was benign. However, with the headline inflation ruling above the policy band of 4+/-2 per cent, RBI has to confront the classic conundrum of Mundell-Fleming trilemma or impossible trinity - maintain an open capital account, stable exchange rate, and still conduct independent monetary policy. Faced with a large BoP surplus, the RBI is faced with two options: absorb the surplus and accumulate more forex reserves or let the ` appreciate. With inflation largely attributed to supply-side disruptions and expected to stabilize, RBI chose to intervene in the forex market, accumulate reserves, prevented one-sided appreciation of ` and supplemented expansionary monetary policy. However, the sustenance of high level of headline inflation has led to the requirement of RBI to maintain a fine balance between tightening of monetary policy to control inflation on the one hand and stimulate growth on the other hand. 3.32 The rise in the foreign exchange reserves of the RBI has largely been due to the current account surplus which, in turn, is largely due to contraction in imports rather than increase in competitiveness of exports. The current account balance, in economic terms, is synonymous with the Savings-Investment balance. A current account surplus implies a higher level of national savings relative to investment. A rise in foreign exchange reserves also represents investments in bonds/ securities of other countries - in effect investing abroad. A developing country like India, needs to spend on domestic investments to spur its growth. The surplus, therefore, gives adequate space for increased expenditure on investments in FY 2021-22. 3.33 The sustainable way for a healthy external sector balance is by enhancing the earnings through exports - which also give a boost to economic growth. Trade facilitation is, therefore, a priority of the Government for cutting down the transaction costs and time, thereby rendering Indian exports more competitive. INITIATIVES TAKEN BY GOVERNMENT TO BOOST EXPORTS 3.34 India acknowledges that in today's interconnected global economy, efforts to streamline, speed up and coordinate trade procedures will drive expansion of trade and help integrate itself with an increasingly globalized production system. Foreign Trade Policy, 2015-2020 was extended for one year i.e., up to 31 st March, 2021 to lend continuity to the existing schemes. Trade Facilitation 3.35 With an aim to reduce trade barriers caused by inefficient and overly burdensome regulatory administrative procedures, the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), negotiated at WTO, came into force on 22nd February 2017. A National Committee on Trade Facilitation (NCTF) was, accordingly, constituted in India in August 2016 with the Cabinet Secretary as the Chair. A National Trade Facilitation Action Plan (NTFAP) for 2017-2020 containing specific activities to further ease out the bottlenecks to trade was prepared. For the period 2020 to 2023, a new NTFAP is under preparation, to take additional reforms to bolster trade facilitation efforts and transform the cross-border clearance eco-system through efficient, transparent, risk based, coordinated, digital, seamless and technology driven procedures. 3.36 India has been making proactive strides in TFA implementation under the guidance of NCTF. Many of the commitments, which are otherwise due by 2022, have already been notified to WTO as implemented viz. Establishment of a Single Window (Article 10.4), Risk 116 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Management for clearance of goods (Article 7.4), etc. Further, the transparency notifications covering information on import and export procedures, enquiry points, single windows etc., have also been notified in April, 2019, reflecting India's commitment towards facilitation of trade with an emphasis to transparency and openness. Further various regulatory relaxation measures were extended for facilitating trade during COVID-19, which include 24X7 clearance, dedicated single window, condonation of delay in filing import declarations, waiver of late filing fees, undertakings instead of bond, etc. India has been at the forefront in undertaking initiatives aimed at maximizing predictability and automation in trade, reflecting in the consistent improvement on the United Nation's Global Survey on Digital and Sustainable Trade. Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) 3.37 India's various export promotion schemes including Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS), were challenged by the United States in WTO in early 2018. The final report of the WTO panel observed that MEIS is a \"prohibited subsidy\" and needs to be withdrawn, against which an appeal has been filed by India. In order to continue supporting the industry and to eliminate any uncertainty amongst the exporting community, Government has rolled out a new WTO compliant scheme, namely Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP), for all export goods with effect from 1 st January, 2021. 3.38 Under this Scheme, duties and taxes levied at the Central, State and local levels, such as electricity duties and V AT on fuel used for transportation, which are not getting exempted or refunded under any other existing mechanism will be refunded to exporters in their ledger account with Customs. The credits can be used to pay basic customs duty on imported goods or transferred to other importers - facilitating ease of transactions for exports. The RoDTEP rates would be notified by the Department of Commerce. Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme 3.39 In order to boost domestic manufacturing and exports, the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme with an outlay of `1.46 lakh crore has been introduced. This Scheme aims to give incentive to companies on incremental sales from products manufactured in domestic units. The ten-identified champion sectors under PLI scheme are advanced chemistry cell (ACC) battery (approved financial outlay over a five year period of `18,100 crore), electronic/technology products ( `5,000 crore), automobile and auto component ( `57,042 crore), pharmaceuticals drugs (`15,000 crore), telecom and networking products ( `12,195 crore), textile products ( `10,683 crore), food crore), high efficiency solar photovoltaic modules ( `4,500 crore), white goods (ACs and LEDs) ( `6,238 crore) and specialty steel ( `6,322 crore). These are in addition to the already notified PLI schemes for mobile manufacturing and specified electronic components ( `40,951 crore), critical Key Starting materials/ Drug Intermediaries and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients ( `6,940 crore) and manufacturing of medical devices ( `7420 crore). 3.40 The scheme is expected to make Indian manufacturers in these ten sectors globally competitive, attract investment in the areas of core competency and cutting-edge technology; ensure efficiencies; create economies of scale; establish backward linkages with MSMEs; enhance exports and make India an integral part of the global supply chain. It also incentivizes global, capital-rich companies to set up capacities in India. Growth in production and exports of industrial goods will greatly expose the Indian industry to foreign competition 117 External Sector and ideas, which will help in improving its capabilities to innovate further. Promotion of the manufacturing sector and creation of a conducive manufacturing ecosystem will not only enable integration with the global supply chains but also establish backward linkages with the MSME sector in the country. This will lead to overall growth in the economy and create huge employment opportunities. Trade Related Logistics 3.41 The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for a resilient logistics sector that can respond to emergencies and supply chain disruptions. Despite the sector being plagued by some structural issues such as highly fragmented ownership; few large players; lack of consolidation in operations; sub-optimal modal share with freight movement highly skewed towards road sector; lack of an integrated approach by user sectors (multiple line ministries and agencies); absence of consistent policies and regulations; etc., India has made remarkable progress in logistics sector. 3.42 India's rank has improved significantly in trading across borders parameter of 'Ease of Doing Business' index from 146 in 2018 to 68 in 2020. The parameter assesses the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. The Logistics Performance Index (LPI), released by the World Bank, assesses relative logistics efficiency of countries. On this index, India was ranked 44 out of 160 countries in 2018 vis-\u00e0-vis rank of 54 in 2014. India is among nine countries having area above ten-lakh square kilometer out of 24 countries analyzed by LPI in 2018, with a score above three. India performs above average after controlling for the level of development and better than some of its BRICS peers (Figure 20). Figure 20: LPI scores controlling for level of development 1.52.02.53.03.54.04.5 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 11.0 12.0LPI Score (2018) Log Per Capita Income (PPP) (2018)IndiaChina RussiaBrazil Source: Based on World Bank dataset 3.43 The National Logistics Policy is in an advanced stage of roll-out with a vision to develop a modern, efficient and resilient logistics services sector that builds on dynamic processes, technology and professional manpower to seamlessly integrate multiple modes of transportation and inventory management to provide more reliable, cost effective, greener, safer and equitable logistics solutions. 118 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 3.44 Some process related reforms which have contributed towards improving logistics efficiency are reduction in waiting time for inter-state border crossing due to GST, revision in axle load norms for heavy vehicles leading to better carrying capacity, introduction of paperless EXIM trade process through E-Sanchit, faceless assessment by 'Turant Customs' by Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), installation of scanners at major ports, implementation of Port Community System 1X at all important ports, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tagging of all EXIM containers for track and trace, mandatory electronic toll collection system (FASTag) for reducing time loss at time toll plaza, etc. 3.45 Some Infrastructure Initiatives which are at various stages of implementation are: a. Bharatmala Pariyojan a is a new umbrella program for the highways sector that envisages building more than 80,000 Km of roads, highways, greenfield expressways, bridges with an investment of around US$ 107 billion. b. Sagarmala aims at Port Modernization & New Port Development, Port Connectivity Enhancement, Port-linked Industrialization, Coastal Community Development and giving impetus to Coastal Shipping. 508 projects have been identified and 111 waterways have been declared National waterways, for which the work is ongoing in phases. c. Multi-Modal Logistics Parks shall act as hubs for freight movement enabling freight aggregation, distribution and multi-modal transportation. They would provide modern mechanized warehousing space and value-added services such as customs clearance with bonded storage yards, warehousing management services, etc. d. Dedicated Fr eight Corridors (DFCs) aims at reduction in unit cost of transportation with higher speed of freight trains and better turnaround of wagons. Around 70 per cent of freight is expected to shift to DFC, freeing up capacity on Indian Railways. e. Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) aims to assist creation of appropriate infrastructure for growth of exports from the States. 3.46 Some Digital/Technological Initiatives that are under development are: a. Logistics Planning and Performance Monitoring Tool (LPPT) shall allow real-time monitoring of operational performance and asset utilization of various logistics infrastructure such as ports, airports, various corridors comprising national and state highways, Inland Container Depots (ICDs), etc. b. India Logistics Platform (iLOG) - Several IT-based solutions have been deployed by government over the years such as Indian Customs EDI Gateway (ICEGATE) and Single Window Interface for Trade (SWIFT) developed for trade facilitation; Port Community System (PCS) for cargo handling at seaports; Freight Operations Information System (FOIS) by Indian Railways and V AHAN (National Vehicle Registration System) by Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. However, each system owner has adopted a different approach, leaving critical gaps that require manual or offline processing at various stages. Therefore, a comprehensive platform iLOG is being developed for integrating all logistics related digital portals.119 External Sector c. The component systems that would be developed simultaneously and later latched on to iLOG through open APIs are secured logistics document exchange (Aadhaar and Blockchain-based security protocols); truck visibility & positioning platform (integrated with e-way bill and Vahan); National e-registry of warehousing; digital trucking; account number (LAN); digital Green corridor; digital port decongestion and container tracking & management system. 3.47 It is estimated that logistics sector employs 12 million workforce, involved mainly in land transportation, warehousing (storage and packaging), supply chain and courier and express services. In order to impart right set of skills to them, a curriculum on logistics and supply chain is being developed for classes 9 and 10 at the school level. Courses will be introduced in Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) and polytechnics missions. INDIA'S ENGAGEMENT WITH WTO 3.48 India is one of the founding members of WT O, which has played an important part in the effective formulation of major trade policies. Increasing protectionism, inadequate members in the Appellate Tribunal for dispute resolution, increasing number of Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) and Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) etc. have resulted in member countries questioning the efficacy of WTO as an institution meant to ensure free trade and promote multilateralism. In the ongoing discussions on WTO reforms, India's proposal seeks to re-affirm the importance of development and promote inclusive growth. The broad elements of India's proposal include: (i) Preserving the core values of the Multilateral Trading System; (ii) Resolving the impasse in the Dispute Settlement System; (iii) Safeguarding development concerns; and (iv) Transparency and Notifications. 3.49 During the WTO TRIPS Council meeting, held on 15-16 October, 2020, India and South Africa jointly proposed \"Waiver from Certain Provisions of the TRIPS Agreement for the Prevention, Containment and Treatment of COVID-19\" for a limited time period, with a view to ensure that the intellectual property rights do not become a barrier in the timely and affordable access to medical products, including vaccines and therapeutics, and enable nations to deal effectively with the public health emergency arising out of COVID-19 pandemic. The proposal has received broad-based support from many WTO members, civil society and international organizations. 3.50 The WT O's Appellate Body (AB) is a permanent body intended by the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) to resolve appeals on issues of law. It is ordinarily composed of seven members having a four-year term, with the possibility of one reappointment. Since July 2017, the United States has been stalling AB appointments on the pretext that it has not been functioning in accordance with the DSU norms - precipitating the 'Appellate Body crisis'. With fewer than three members to hear any appeal since 10 th December, 2019, the AB is not able to function as mandated under the DSU. In the wake of this crisis, around 23 WTO members have created a Multiparty Interim Arbitration (MPIA) mechanism that closely replicates the substantive and procedural 120 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 aspects of appellate review under the AB. EU, China, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand are some of the key members of MPIA. India has not joined MPIA yet. India supports the restoration and preservation of the normal functioning of the two-stage binding WTO dispute settlement mechanism. 3.51 In agriculture, India along with many other developing countries, have been demanding a permanent solution on the issue of public stockholding for food security purposes. This has become even more relevant in the wake of the ongoing pandemic, as the government had to step up disbursement of food grains under the public distribution programmes for ensuring food security of the masses. India has also been raising the issue of imbalances and asymmetries in the existing Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) and their implications for developing countries. As per the Buenos Aires Ministerial Decision (MC11) of December, 2017, WTO Members agreed to continue to engage constructively to frame disciplines on fisheries subsidies by the next Ministerial Conference (MC-12) in 2020. The negotiations are ongoing and are being conducted in the form of monthly cluster meetings under Negotiating Group on Rules (NGR) in the WTO. 3.52 WTO members agreed not to impose customs duties on electronic transmissions in 1998 and since then, the moratorium has been extended periodically at the ministerial meetings. India and South Africa made a joint submission under the Work Program on E-Commerce titled, 'The E-Commerce Moratorium: Scope and its Impact' in March, 2020, which, inter alia, argues that reconsideration of the moratorium is important for developing countries to preserve policy space for their digital advancement. In response to the failure to obtain a multilateral mandate for rule-making in e-commerce, in January, 2019, a Joint Statement on e-commerce was issued on behalf of seventy-six WTO members supporting rule-making on e-commerce. India has not joined the said plurilateral initiative. India believes that developing countries need to focus on improving domestic physical and digital infrastructure, creating supportive policy and regulatory frameworks and developing digital capabilities to bridge the digital divide and enable shared benefits of digitalization. 3.53 India conducts anti-dumping, anti-subsidyand safeguard investigations on the basis of applications filed by the domestic industry with prima facie evidence of dumping/ subsidization of goods, injury to the domestic industry and causal link between dumping/ subsidization and injury to the domestic industry. Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) has introduced an online portal - ARTIS (Application for Remedies in Trade for Indian industry and other Stakeholders) - to submit online petitions for different trade remedies like anti-dumping duty, safeguard duty and countervailing duty. During the period from 01.04.2020 to 30.10.2020, DGTR initiated 43 anti-dumping investigations, 4 countervailing duty investigations and 1 safeguard investigation. WAY FORWARD 3.54 The COVID-19 pandemic impacted external sector differently for dif ferent countries. While countries witnessed contraction in exports and imports, AEs suffered larger contraction and EMDEs, less, especially the East-Asian economies. In India, calibrated easing of lockdown restrictions narrowed contraction in both exports and imports with imports posting faster recovery leading to progressive expansion of merchandise trade deficit over the quarters of the 121 External Sector CHAPTER AT A GLANCE COVID-19 pandemic has led to a sharp decline in global trade, lower commodity prices and tighter external financing conditions with varying implications for current account balances and currencies of different countries. Trade balance with China and the US improved as imports slowed. While exports of gems and jewellery, engineering goods, textile and allied products slide, exports of drugs and pharma, software and agriculture and allied products improved. Pharma exports, in particular, hold the potential to be the pharmacy of the world. Overall, India is expected to witness current account surplus during the current financial year after a gap of 17 years The foreign exchange reserves rose to an all-time high of US$ 586.1 billion as on January 8, 2021. Balance on the capital account, was buttressed by robust FDI and FPI inflows, RBI's interventions in the forex markets ensured financial stability and orderly conditions and have been largely successful in controlling the volatility and one-sided appreciation of the rupee. Various initiatives undertaken to promote exports, including Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme, Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP), improvement in logistics infrastructure and digital initiatives would go a long way in strengthening external sector in general and exports in particular. current year. Improving trends in India's merchandise trade have been supplemented by equity capital inflows, robust FDI inflows and sustained build-up of foreign exchange reserves. The comfortable foreign exchange reserves give the much-needed space for enhanced domestic investments. The disruption of global manufacturing value chains due to the COVID-19 pandemic presents a tremendous opportunity for India to become one of the key nodes in the chain. Various export initiatives, as documented above - including those aimed at promoting ease of exporting - have been undertaken by the government and RBI and implementation of these initiatives would pave the way for the sustainable export performance in India going forward.122 Economic Survey 2020-21 V POL exports 11.8 11.8 13.0 9.9 11.1 10.1 10.9 9.1 4.9 7.3 1b Non-POL exports 70.2 & Silver imports 9.7 9.8 8.3 8.8 12.5 5.3 7.5 5.6 1.3 6.2 2b(ii)Non-POL, Non-Gold & Silver imports84.2 31.8 31.8 33.2 35.6 30.0 30.3 6 Services (net) 18.7 20.3 21.7 21.3 20.0 20.4 21.9 22.0 20.5 21.2 7 Transfers (net) 17.0 19.3 17.4 16.2 18.0 20.0 18.7 18.4 (11+12)1.4 7.6 5.2 15.9 18.7 9.9 17.8 -1.8 -0.2 31.6 11 Foreign Direct Investment (net) 9.6 7.4 7.3 6.4 13.9 7.4 10.0 12.0 -0.8 24.6 12 FPI (net) -8.1 0.2 -2.1 9.4 4.8 2.5 8.1 -13.7 0.6 7.0 13 External Assistance (net) 0.5 0.0 1.7 1.3 1.5 0.4 1.3 0.6 4.1 1.9 14Commercial Borrowings (MT & LT) (net)-1.3 2.2 2.0 7.5 6.4 3.4 3.2 10.3 -1.4 -4.3 15 Banking Capital (net) 10.1 0.5 -1.8 -2.3 -4.6 2.2 -11.2 16 Rupee Debt Service (net) 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 -0.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 -0.1 0.0 17 Short term credits (net) -3.5 4.8 -0.7 1.5 2.0 -0.6 -1.4 -1.0 -0.2 -1.8 18 Other Capital (net) -2.4 0.7 1.2 3.2 0.8 3.7 13.8 -3.5 -0.7 19Capital Account (net) (10+13+14+15+16+17+18)4.8 16.6 13.8 19.2 27.9 12.1 22.4 17.4 1.0 15.4 20 Errors and Omissions (net) -0.3 0.6 -0.3 -0.4 0.4 -0.7 0.7 (net)(9+19+20) -11.3 -1.9 -4.3 14.2 14.0 5.1 21.6 18.8 19.8 31.6 22Foreign Exchange Reserves (Increase - / Decrease +) Provisional.CHAPTER04 Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation Given the unprecedented shock of COVID-19 pandemic, monetary policy was significantly eased from March 2020 onwards. The repo rate has been cut by 115 bps since March 2020, with 75 bps cut in first Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting in March 2020 and 40 bps cut in second meeting in May 2020. The policy rates were kept unchanged in further meetings, but the liquidity support was significantly enhanced. Systemic liquidity in 2020-21 remained in surplus so far. RBI undertook various conventional and unconventional measures like Open Market Operations, Long Term Repo Operations, Targeted Long Term Repo Operations etc. to manage liquidity situation in the economy. The financial flows to the real economy however remained constrained on account of subdued credit growth by both banks and Non-Banking Financial Corporations. The higher reserve money growth did not fully translate into commensurate money supply growth due to the lower (adjusted) money multiplier reflecting large deposits by banks with RBI under reverse repo. Credit growth of banks slowed down to 6.7 per cent as on January 1,2021. The credit offtake from banking sector witnessed a broad based slowdown in 2020-21. Gross Non Performing Assets ratio of Scheduled Commercial Banks decreased from 8.21 per cent at the end of March 2020 to 7.49 per cent at the end of September 2020. However, this has to be seen in conjunction with the asset classification relief provided to borrowers on account of the pandemic. Capital to risk-weighted asset ratio of Scheduled Commercial Banks increased from 14.7 per cent to 15.8 per cent between March 2020 and September 2020 with improvement in both Public and Private sector banks. This year saw improvement in transmission of policy repo rates to deposit and lending rates, as reflected in the decline of 94 bps and 67 bps in Weighted Average Lending Rate on fresh rupee loans and outstanding rupee loans respectively from March 2020 to November 2020. Similarly, the Weighted Average Domestic Term Deposit Rate declined by 81 bps during the same period. Nifty50 and S&P BSE Sensex reached record high closing of 14,644.7 and 49,792.12 on January 20,2021 respectively during 2020-21. The recovery rate for the Scheduled Commercial Banks through IBC (since its inception) has been over 45 per cent. In view of COVID-19 pandemic, initiation of Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) was suspended for any default arising on or after March 25, 2020 for a period of 6 months. This was further extended twice for 3 months on September 24, 2020 and December 22, 2020. The suspension along with continued clearance has allowed a small decline in accumulated cases. MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS DURING 2020-21 4.1 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank met five times since March 2020. In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the MPC advanced its first two meetings of 2020-21 from first week of April to end March and from first week of June to May, 20-22. The August 124 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 1 and the December 2020 meetings were held as per schedule, while the October meeting was postponed by a week as new external members were onboarded to the MPC. Since March 27, 2020, the policy repo rate has been reduced by 115 basis points (bps) from 5.15 per cent to 4.0 per cent so far (Table 1). The monetary policy responses during the year 2020-21 were necessitated by the extraordinary situation prevailing due to COVID-19. Table 1: Revision in Policy Rates Effective Date Repo Rate (per cent)Reverse Repo Rate (per cent)Cash Reserve Ratio (per cent of NDTL)Statutory Liquidity Ratio (per cent of NDTL)Bank Rate/ MSF 3.0 18.0 4.25 Source: RBI Note: NDTL: Net demand and time liabilities 4.2 In its first bi-monthly monetary policy statement of March 27, 2020, the MPC decided to reduce the policy repo rate by 75 bps from 5.15 per cent to 4.40 per cent. Alongside, the reverse repo rate was reduced by 90 bps to 4.0 per cent, thus creating an asymmetrical corridor to make it unattractive for banks to passively deposit funds with the Reserve Bank and nudge them to use these funds for on-lending to productive sectors of the economy. The MPC decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. In the second meeting in May 2020, MPC reduced the policy repo rate by 40 bps to 4.0 per cent based on the assessment that the macroeconomic impact of the pandemic was turning out to be more severe than initially anticipated. 4.3 MPC decided to keep the policy rate unchanged in its August, October and December 2020 meetings. While the inflation hovered above the tolerance zone for a few months, the committee was of the view that the underlying factors keeping inflation elevated were essentially supply shocks that should dissipate over time as the economy unlocks, supply chains restore and activity normalises. RBI in its latest MPC meeting revised upwards the projected the GDP growth from (-) 9.5 per cent to (-) 7.5 per cent in 2020-21. 4.4 During 2020-21, the growth of monetary aggregates witnessed higher growth as compared to previous few years on account of higher liquidity in the economy. In 2020-21 so far, Reserve money (M0) recorded a Year on Year (YoY) growth of 15.2 per cent as on January 15, 2021 as compared to 11.4 per cent a year ago. However, M0 adjusted for the first-round impact of changes in the CRR recorded an even higher growth (YoY) of 19.2 per cent as compared to 11.0 per cent a year ago (Figure 1). Expansion in M0 during 2020-21 was driven by currency in circulation (CIC) from the component side, which witnessed a surge in the post-COVID-19 pandemic period. The growth (YoY) in CIC was 21.9 per cent as on January 15, 2021, as compared to 1 1.6 per cent in the corresponding period of previous year (T able 2). . 125 Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation Table 2: Growth (YoY) in Monetary Aggregates (per cent) Item 2015-16 2016-17^ 2019-20 16.8 14.5 21.9# Cash with Banks 6.6 4.2 -2.1 21.4 15.4 6.6 Currency with the Public 15.2 -20.8 39.2 16.6 14.5 22.7 Bankers' Deposits with the RBI 7.8 8.4 3.9 6.4 -9.6 -11.9# Demand Deposits 11.0 18.4 6.2 9.6 6.8 17.1 Time Deposits 9.2 10.2 5.8 9.6 8.1 10.1 Reserve Money (M0) 13.1 -12.9 27.3 14.5 9.4 15.2# Narrow Money (M1) 13.5 -3.9 21.8 13.6 11.2 20.5 Broad Money (M3) 10.1 6.9 9.2 10.5 8.9 12.5 Source: RBI Note: *: as on January 01,2021. ^: March 31, 2017 over April 1, 2016 barring Reserve Money (M0), Currency in Circulation and Bankers' Deposits with the RBI. #as on January 15, 2021 Figure 1: M0, CRR Adjusted M0 and CIC Growth (YoY) Source: RBI 4.5 Among the sources of M0 - comprising of net domestic assets (NDA) [net Reserve Bank credit to the government, banks and commercial sector] and net foreign assets (NFA) - the main driver for increase in M0 during 2020-21 was NFA, attributable to the Reserve Bank's net purchases from Authorised Dealers (ADs). Net Reserve Bank credit to the government has been lower during 2020-21 so far vis-\u00e0-vis the corresponding period of the previous year due to higher cash balances of the central government with the RBI. Among other constituents of NDA, net Reserve Bank claims on banks and the commercial sector (mainly Primary Dealers (PDs)) largely remained in the negative territory, reflecting surplus liquidity in the system (more details on this is provided in following section). 4.6 In 2020-21 so far (as on January 1, 2021), the YoY growth of Broad Money (M3) stood at 12.5 per cent, as compared to 10.1 per cent in the corresponding period a year ago (Figure 2). The significant rise in reserve money has not translated into a commensurate increase in money supply as the money multiplier has remained depressed due to a sharp rise in currency-deposit ratio, and also lar ge amount of funds parked under reverse repos with RBI. 126 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 1 Figure 2: Broad money growth (YoY) Source: RBI 4.7 From the component side, aggregate deposits which is the largest component has contributed most in the expansion of M3 during the year so far (Figure 3). Amongst sources, bank credit to the government was a major contributor to the increase in M3. Banks' higher investments in liquid and risk-free assets such as SLR securities and G-secs, resulted in higher net bank credit to the government. Bank credit to the commercial sector also supplemented M3 expansion from the sources side. The credit growth of SCBs (YoY) was 6.7 per cent as on January 1, 2021 as compared to 7.5 per cent at the corresponding time a year ago. Figure 3: Deposits growth (YoY) Source: RBI 4.8 Money multiplier, measured as a ratio of M3/M0 which was mostly increasing from 1980s onwards up to 2016-17, has however been declining since then. As on March 31, 2020, the 127 Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation money multiplier was 5.5, slightly lower than 5.6 a year earlier. However, adjusted for reverse repo - analytically akin to banks' deposits with the central bank - Money Multiplier turned out to be even lower at 4.8 by end-March 2020. Money multiplier has declined from the recent peak of 5.8 in October 2018 to 5.5 as on January 1, 2021 (Figure 4). In comparison, during the same period, money multiplier adjusted for reverse repo has declined sharply from 5.7 to 4.5. This shows that the money supply has responded only partially to reserve money growth, reflecting that the liquidity transmission in the economy remains impaired. The gap between money multiplier and adjusted money reflected the large amount of funds parked by banks under reverse repo window by RBI. Figure 4: Money Multiplier Source: RBI Note: Money multiplier adjusted for repo means that the reserve money includes commercial banks' reverse repo deposits with RBI LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS AND ITS MANAGEMENT 4.9 The systemic liquidity in 2020-21 so far has consistently remained in surplus reflecting several liquidity enhancing measures undertaken by the Reserve Bank in the wake of COVID-19 induced disruptions. The main drivers of liquidity during 2020-21 have been Currency in Circulation (CIC), Government cash balances and the Reserve Bank's forex operations. While CIC withdrawals and build-up of Government cash balances resulted in liquidity drainage from the banking system, the Reserve Bank's forex operations augmented systemic liquidity . 4.10 Reserve Bank undertook several conventional and unconventional measures to manage the liquidity in the economy starting from February 2020. These measures, inter alia, included: i. Injection of durable liquidity of more than ` 2.7 lakh crore through Open Market Operation (OMO) purchases between February 6-December 4, 2020.128 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 1 ii. OMOs in State Development Loans (SDLs) as a special case were also introduced during the current financial year. The OMOs were conducted for a basket of SDLs comprising securities issued by states. Aggregate liquidity to the tune of ` 30,000 crore was injected through three OMO purchase auctions (October 22, 2020, November 5, 2020 and December 23, 2020) under this facility . iii. Targeted Long Term Repo Operations (TLTROs) of up to three years' tenor for a total amount of ` 1.13 lakh crore for investment in corporate bonds, commercial papers, and non-convertible debentures, in addition to injection of ` 1.25 lakh crore through Long Term Repo Operations (L TROs) conducted in February-March 2020. iv. Reduction in the CRR requirement of banks from 4 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) to 3 per cent with effect from March 28, 2020 augmenting primary liquidity in the banking system by about ` 1.37 lakh crore. v. Raising banks' limit for borrowing overnight under the MSF by dipping into their Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) to 3 per cent of NDTL from 2 per cent, allowing the banking system to avail an additional ` 1.37 crore of liquidity. vi. Special Liquidity Facility for mutual funds for ` 50,000 crore; and vii. Refinance facility worth ` 75,000 crore for all India financial institutions i.e., NABARD, NHB, SIDBI and EXIM Bank. 4.11 In the wake of sell off triggered by risk aversion and flight to safety in the beginning of year 2020, RBI conducted two 6-month USD/INR sell/buy swap auctions on March 16 and March 23, 2020 and injected dollar liquidity of US$ 2.7 billion to meet the increased demand for US dollars in the foreign exchange market. The measures listed above coupled with forex purchases resulted in expansion of surplus liquidity, as reflected in average daily net liquidity absorptions under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF), from ` 3.43 lakh crore at end of January 2020 to ` 5.47 lakh crore on January 15, 2021 (Figure 5). Figure 5: Liquidity Management Source: RBI. Note: Negative indicates liquidity in surplus.129 Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation 4.12 The increased government spending during April-May 2020 also added to the liquidity surplus. However, the Government's cash balances turned into surplus in June 2020 and July 2020. In Q2 of 2020, although surplus liquidity conditions still existed, there was moderation as compared to Q1. As a result, average daily net absorption under the LAF decreased to ` 3.95 lakh crore in July 2020 as average Government cash surplus increased to ` 95,942 crore. Thereafter, daily net absorption increased to ` 4.03 lakh crore in August 2020, which again moderated to ` 3.68 lakh crore in September 2020. This moderation could be attributed to the absorption of banking sector liquidity to the tune of ` 1.24 lakh crore under the option given to banks to return the funds availed under LTRO facility before maturity. The moderation in liquidity absorption, however, was reversed in following months as average daily net absorption under the LAF again increased to ` 4.47 lakh crore and ` 5.64 lakh crore in the month of October and November 2020. This is partly a reflection of pick up in government spending. 4.13 In order to ensure better monetary transmission through a more even distribution of liquidity across tenors, 14 simultaneous sale-purchase OMO auctions for ` 10,000 crore each were conducted in the financial year 2020-21 4.14 Further, comfortable liquidity conditions were reflected in the movement of weighted average call rate (WACR) during the period. The WACR generally remained within the policy corridor although it traded with a distinct downward bias, reflecting the comfortable liquidity and financing conditions (Figure 6). However, the liquidity availability in the system pushed down the WACR outside the corridor from late October and remained so until early January. The gap between short and long liquidity is reflected on the yield curve (discussed in the next section). Figure 6: Policy Corridor and WACR Source: RBI130 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 1 DEVELOPMENTS IN THE G-SEC MARKETS 4.15. During the first half of 2020-21, the 10-year benchmark G-sec yield traded with a softening bias (Figure 7) tracking lower policy rates, subdued crude oil prices and surplus liquidity. The 10-year benchmark G-sec yield which was around 6.4-6.5 percent in April 2020 touched a low of 5.73 per cent in mid May 2020. Figure 7: India 10-Year Benchmark G-sec Yield Source: Bloomberg. 4.16 In the first quarter of 2020-21, the yields on 10 year benchmark G-sec showed a declining trend. The yields hardened during the first fortnight of April 2020 due to low trading volumes amid the countrywide lockdown and reduced market hours, selling pressure by Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) along with the upward movement of US treasury yields. However, yields softened in the second half of the month, reflecting the impact of a sharp decline in crude oil prices, the announcement by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to keep the target range of the Fed Funds rate unchanged at 0-0.25 per cent and a lower CPI reading for March 2020 relative to that for February 2020. The yield on 10-year benchmark security opened at 6.20 per cent on April 3, 2020 and closed at 5.89 per cent on June 30, 2020. 4.17. The yields continued to harden, tracking higher than expected CPI print for July 2020 and a pause in rate cut by MPC. Subsequently, the benchmark yield drew comfort from a series of special OMOs and outright OMO carried out by the Reserve Bank. Further, OMO on SDLs, increase of OMO amount to ` 20,000 crore and extension of held-to-maturity benefit for SLR securities by one more year to March 31, 2022 provided support to the bond market. Subsequently, new 10-year benchmark yield touched a three-month low of 5.79 per cent on October 26, 2020. However, the yield on benchmark bond drifted up again slightly and stood at 5.92 per cent on January 20, 2021. 4.18 In comparison, the yields on shorter term government securities fell down sharply in 2020- 21 (Figure 8). This is seen clearly in the shape of yield curve, where the gap has widened sharply at the shorter end of the curve. The yields on 3 month, 6 month, 1 year, 3 year and 5 year 131 Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation government bonds has reduced by 201 bps, 181 bps and 147 bps, 125 bps and 77 bps respectively from end March 2020 to December 23, 2020. RBI has undertaken various measures to even out the yield curve including measures such as simultaneous sale-purchase OMO auctions various times in last year. Figure 8: Yield curve of Indian Government Bonds Source: Bloomberg Note: Date is for the end of month 4.19 In 2020-21, certain specified categories of Central Government securities were opened up fully for non-resident securities without any restrictions, apart from being available to domestic investors as well from April 1, 2020. Accordingly, a separate route viz., Fully Accessible Route (FAR) for investment by non-residents in securities issued by the Government was notified. 'Specified securities', once so designated, shall remain eligible for investment under the FAR until maturity. A list of existing securities was put under FAR from April 1, 2020 and in addition, all new issuances of government securities of 5-year, 10-year and 30-year tenors from the financial year 2020-21 will be eligible under FAR as 'specified securities'.This is a necessary step towards India' s inclusion in the global bond indices. BANKING SECTOR 4.20 Gross Non-Performing Advances (GNPA) ratio (i.e. GNPAs as a percentage of Gross Advances) of Scheduled Commercial Banks decreased from 8.2 per cent at the end-March 2020 to 7.5 per cent at end-September 2020. Restructured Standard Advances (RSA) ratio of Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) increased from 0.36 per cent to 0.41 per cent during the same period. Overall, the Stressed Advances ratio of SCBs decreased from 8.6 per cent at end- March 2020 to 7.9 per cent at end- September 2020. 4.21 GNP A ratio of Public Sector Banks (PSBs) decreased from 10.25 per cent at the end- March 2020 to 9.4 per cent at end-September 2020 and the Stressed Advances ratios decrea sed 132 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 1 from 10.75 per cent to 9.96 per cent during the same period. Net NPA ratios also declined and stood at 2.1 per cent for SCBs and 2.85 per cent for PSBs as at end- September 2020. 4.22 Capital to risk-weighted asset ratio (CRAR) of SCBs increased from 14.7 per cent to 15.8 per cent between March 2020 and September 2020 on account of improvement of improvement of CRAR of both Public and Private sector banks. SCBs' annualised Return on Assets (RoA) recovered from 0.07 per cent to 0.64 per cent during first half (H1) of 2020-21, while their annualised Return on Equity (RoE) recovered from 0.78 per cent to 7.68 per cent during the same period. The RoA and RoE for PSBs became positive in June 2020 and continued to be positive in the quarter ended September 2020, after recording negative profitability ratios from March 2016 to March 2020 (Table 3). This is mainly on account of moratorium granted and asset classification stand still order by the Supreme Court. Table 3: NPAs, CRAR, RoE, RoA of Public Sector Banks and Private Sector Banks (Amount in ` crore; Rates and Ratios in Per cent) Reporting DatePublic Sector Banks Private Sector Banks Gross NPAsCapital Ratio (CRAR)Return on Equity Return on Total Assets Gross NPAsCapital Ratio (CRAR)Return on Equity Return Returns, Global Operations, RBI 4.23 The net profit (profit after tax) for PSBs increased from ` (-) 25,941 crore at end-March 2020 to ` 14,688 crore at end-September 2020. Similarly, the net profit (profit after tax) for private sector banks increa sed from ` 19,113 crore at end-March 2020 to ` 32,762 crore at end- September 2020. Overall, for SCBs, the net profit (profit after tax) increased from ` 11,322 crore at end-March 2020 to ` 59,426 crore at end-September 2020. 4.24 The focus on resolution of stressed assets had to take a backseat during the year on account of the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Government had suspended the initiation of fresh insolvency proceedings under Section 7, 9 and 10 of Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code 2016 for defaults arising on or after March 25, 2020 till March 25, 2021. Reserve Bank announced loan moratorium from March 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020, asset classification dispensation and special resolution framework for Covid-19 related stressed assets. In respect of borrowers to whom moratorium was granted, the period during which such facilities were granted was permitted to be excluded from the calculation of days past due for the purpose of asset classification or out of order status, as the case may be. Further, RBI announced a Resolution Framework for COVID-19-related Stress to enable the lenders to implement a resolution plan in respect of eligible corporate exposures without change in ownership, and personal loans, while classifying such exposures as Standard, subject to certain conditions. Under the resolution plans that could be invoked under the above window, lenders are permitted to grant additional moratorium of up to two years. RBI had appointed a committee under K.V. Kamath for making recommendations 133 Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation on the required financial parameters to be factored in resolution plans. Also, MSME accounts classified as Standard where the aggregate exposure of banks and NBFCs was ` 25 crore or below as on March 1, 2020, were permitted to be restructured without a downgrade in the asset classification, subject to certain conditions. Notably, the Supreme Court issued an interim order dated September 3, 2020 specifying that \"the accounts which were not declared NPA till 31.08.2020 shall not be declared NP A till further orders\". 4.25 The above measures, which provided asset classification reliefs to borrowers, would affect the true recognition of financial stress on the borrower accounts. However, the larger objective of financial stability in the wake of pandemic demanded prudential forbearance which was exercised through clear boundaries and disincentives embedded in the above reliefs. Moreover, the risk recognition has not been completely suspended as the lenders are required to make provisions of at least 10 per cent in respect of accounts which availed of asset classification benefits under the above reliefs. MONETARY POLICY TRANSMISSION 4.26 RBI has reduced repo rate by 250 bps since February 2019 (the current easing cycle). The transmission of policy repo rate changes has been weak on quantity of credit. However, there has been improved transmission on rate structure and term structure. a. Rate structure 4.27 The transmission of policy repo rate changes to deposit and lending rates of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) has improved since March 2020 reflecting the combined impact of policy rate cuts, large liquidity surplus with accommodative policy stance, and the introduction of external benchmark-based pricing of loans. The weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans declined by 94 bps between March 2020 and November 2020 in response to the reduction of 115 bps in the policy repo rate and comfortable liquidity conditions. In the current easing phase (February 2019 to November 2020), the change in the WALR on outstanding rupee loans has shown significant improvement since March 2020. Of the 83-bps decline in WALR on outstanding loans in February 2019 to November 2020 period, 67 bps decline was noted since March 2020. The weighted average domestic term deposit rate (WADTDR) on outstanding rupee deposits declined by 127 bps during the ongoing easing cycle. The median term deposit rate has registered a sizable decline of 146 bps in March to December 2020 (Table 4). The spread between WALR on outstanding loans and repo rate which was increasing since 2018 started to decline in 2020-21. However , WALR on outstanding loans is still 544 bps higher than repo rate (Figure 9). Table 4: Transmission from Repo Rate to Banks' Deposit and Lending Rates (bps) Period Repo RateTerm Deposit Rates Lending Rates Median Term Deposit RateWADTDR 1 Year Median MCLRWALR - Outstanding Rupee Loans WALR - Fresh Rupee WADTDR: Weighted Average Domestic Term Deposit Rate; MCLR: Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate. * Latest data on WALR and WADTR pertain to November 2020.134 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 1 Figure 9: Spread between WALR (on outstanding loans) and repo rate Source: RBI 4.28 Across bank groups, Private Sector Banks exhibited greater transmission in terms on fresh loans, however Public Sector Banks exhibited greater transmission on outstanding loans for the entire easing cycle. Private Sector Banks also reduced deposit rates (measured by WADTDR) more than Public Sector Banks.

The saving deposit rates of five major banks, which ranged 3.25-3.5 per cent prior to the introduction of the external benchmark (in end September 2019), were placed at 2.7-3.0 per cent as on January 15, 2021. The flexible adjustment of saving deposit rates bodes well for monetary transmission to lending rates.135 Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation (b) Credit Growth 4.30. Cumulatively, since February 2019, the reduction in policy rate has been of 250 bps, yet the credit growth been declining since then. Credit growth (YoY) stood at 14.8 per cent in February 2019 and had declined to 5.1 per cent as on October 23, 2020 (Figure 10). Note that it subsequently accelerated and stands at 6.7 per cent as on January 1,2021. Figure 10: Bank Credit growth (YoY) (per cent) Source: RBI Figure 11: Sectoral Bank Credit Growth (YoY) Source: RBI136 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 1 4.31. The non-food credit growth (YoY), based on sectoral deployment of bank credit data was 6.0 per cent in November 2020 (details available up to November only) as compared with a growth of 7.2 per cent in November 2019. The moderation in credit growth in 2020-21 was witnessed in mostly all the sectors, barring services (Figure 11). Credit growth to agriculture & allied activities decelerated in first quarter of 2019-20 but then accelerated to 8.5 per cent in November 2020 with significant pick up since September (Figure 11). Credit growth to industry has been decelerating consistently and infact contracted by 1.7 per cent in October 2020 and 0.7 per cent in November 2020. Services sector bucked the downtrend with credit growth to this sector accelerating to 9.5 per cent in October 2020 and 8.8 per cent in November 2020. Within this sector, credit to 'trade' recorded a double-digit growth of 14.7 per cent in November 2020 as compared to 4.6 per cent a year ago. However, credit growth to commercial real estate and NBFCs declined in 2020-21. Personal loans growth decelerated to 10 per cent in November 2020 from 16.4 per cent in November 2019. Within the personal loan segment, the two main components are vehicle loans and housing loans. While the growth of vehicle loans growth accelerated to 10 per cent in October 2020 from 4.7 per cent a year ago, that of housing loans growth decelerated to 8.5 per cent in November 2020 from 18.3 per cent a year ago (T able 6).

Data relate to select banks which cover about 90 per cent of total non-food credit extended by all scheduled commercial banks; (c) Term Structure 4.32. The reduction in policy rates and surplus liquidity helped in bringing down both the short term and long term interest rates. However, the impact has been much smaller on longer term interest rates. Since the beginning of this financial year, the interest on 1 year security has fallen much more than that on 10 year G-Secs. The yield on 1 year G-Sec has reduced by 157 bps from April 2020 to December 2020, whereas the yield on 10 year G-sec has declined by only 24 bps in the same time period (Figure 12). The gap between two yields have widened over this year . 137 Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation Figure 12: Government Bond yields in India (per cent) Source: Bloomberg 4.33 The lower policy rates have transmitted to corporate bonds and the yield has come down substantially from March 2020 (Fig 13 (a) and Fig 13 (b)). Rates have reduced for both AA and AAA rated bonds. The yields on 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, 10 year AAA corporate bonds have fallen by 238 bps, 237 bps, 155 bps, 112 bps respectively from January 2020 to December 2020. If the fall of entire easing cycle is considered (i.e. since early 2019), then the decline are 430 bps, 326 bps, 271 bps and 212 bps respectively.

Restructuring of MSME loans: A one-time restructuring of loans to MSMEs that were in default but 'standard' as on January 1, 2019, was permitted, without an asset classification downgrade, subject to certain conditions like aggregate exposure (including non-fund-based facilities) of banks and NBFCs to the borrower not exceeding `25 crore as on January 1, 2019. The borrowing entity has to be GST- registered. However, this condition will not apply to MSMEs that are exempt from GST-registration. The cut-off date of January 1, 2019 was extended to March 1, 2020 to support viable MSME entities on account of the fallout of COVID-19. The banks are required to implement the restructuring by March 31, 2021. c. Large exposure framework: A bank's exposure under the Large Exposure Framework to a group of connected counterparties was increased from 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the eligible capital base of the bank. The increased limit will be applicable up to June 30, 2021. d. Export Credit : The maximum permissible period of pre-shipment and post-shipment export credit sanctioned by banks was increased from one year to 15 months for disbursements made up to July 31, 2020, in line with the relaxation granted in the period of realization and repatriation of the export proceeds to India.139 Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation e. Monetary policy transmission - external benchmarking of loans: RBI deregulated the interest rates on advances by SCBs (excluding RRBs). With a view to strengthen the transmission of monetary policy, the banks were mandated to link all new floating rate personal or retail loans and floating rate loans extended to MSMEs to external benchmarks such as repo rate, Treasury Bill Rate and any external benchmark published by Financial Benchmarks India Pvt Ltd (FBIL). Banks can offer such external benchmark linked loans to other types of borrowers as well. In order to ensure transparency, standardisation, and ease of understanding of loan products by borrowers, banks were also advised to adopt a uniform external benchmark within a loan category . Under the external benchmark system, the interest reset period for loans was also reduced to three months with a view to pass on the benefit of reduction in policy repo rate to the borrowers more frequently. Further, to make the benefit of external benchmark linked interest rate regime available to the existing borrowers (Base Rate/MCLR), banks were advised to provide a switchover option to such borrowers on mutually agreed terms. Co-operative Bank a. Revision in the target for priority sector lending: To promote financial inclusion, the overall priority sector lending target for Urban Co-operative Banks has been increased from the present level of 40 per cent of adjusted net bank credit (ANBC) or credit equivalent amount of off-balance sheet exposure (CEOBSE), whichever is higher, to 75 per cent of ANBC or CEOBSE, whichever is higher by March 31, 2024. b. Inclusion of co-operative banks as eligible member lending institutions under interest subvention scheme for MSMEs - issuance of guidelines : All co-operative banks have been advised of their inclusion as Eligible Lending Institutions under the \"Interest Subvention Scheme (ISS) for MSMSEs 2018\" of the Government. This scheme provides an interest relief of two per cent per annum to eligible MSMEs on their outstanding fresh/incremental term loan/working capital during the period of its validity. c. Reporting of large exposures to Central Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC): Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) with assets of `500 crore and above were brought under the CRILC reporting framework. Accordingly, UCBs shall report credit information, including classification of an account as Special Mention Account (SMA), on all borrowers having aggregate exposures of `5 crore and above with them to CRILC. d. Limits on exposure to single and group borrowers and large exposures: The exposure norms for single borrower and a group of borrowers from 15 per cent and 40 per cent of UCB's capital funds, to 15 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively, of UCB's Tier -I capital. The revised exposure limits shall apply to all types of fresh exposures taken by UCBs, and they shall bring down their existing exposures which are in excess of the revised limits to within the aforesaid revised limits by March 31, 2023. Further, 140 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 1 UCBs shall have at least 50 per cent of their aggregate loans and advances comprising loans of not more than `25 lakh or 0.2 per cent of their tier I capital, whichever is higher, subject to a maximum of `1 crore, per borrower. e. Submission of returns under Section 31 (read with section 56) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 - Extension of time : In view of the difficulties faced by UCBs in submission of the returns due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the timeline for the furnishing of the returns for the financial year ended on March 31, 2020, was first extended by three months, i.e., till September 30, 2020 and then further to December 31,2020. f. Amendments to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949: Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2020: The Banking Regulation Act has been amended by the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2020. The key changes in the regulatory regime of UCBs pursuant to the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2020 are as under: The Reserve Bank has been given powers over the management of the UCBs, owing to which it can issue directions relating to the management of UCBs including approval for appointment of Chairman / MD / CEO, removal and remuneration of MD / CEO. Further, the Board of UCBs would be required to have not less than 51 per cent members having special knowledge / practical experience in specified areas. The statutory restriction on grant of director-related loans / advances has been widened and common directorship across banks shall be prohibited as per the provisions of the amended Act. The Reserve Bank has been vested with powers of approval of the appointment / removal of statutory auditors of UCBs. Provisions of the revised Act will enable UCBs to raise capital by issue of equity/ preference/special shares and debentures/bonds/like securities subject to such conditions as the Reserve Bank may specify in this behalf. The Reserve Bank has been empowered to supersede the Board of Directors of a UCB; though in case of a UCB having operations confined to a single State, in consultation with the concerned State Government. T he Rese rve Bank has bee n em powered to sanc tion volunt ary/compulsory am algamation and to prepare scheme for reconstruction of a UCB with the approval of the Central Government. The amended Act provides for winding up of a UCB by High Court at the instance of the Reserve Bank.141 Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation NON-BANKING FINANCIAL COMPANIES (NBFC) SECTOR 4.35. Credit growth of NBFCs continued to slow down. Credit growth (YoY) of the NBFC sector was close to 3 per cent in June 2020. Further, the credit growth contracted in September 2020 with a YoY growth of -6.6 per cent. The sector had witnessed credit growth of 2.72 per cent from `23.16 lakh crore in March 2019 to `23.8 lakh crore in March 2020 as compared with 17.7 per cent growth during the previous year (Figure 14). Figure 14: Growth (YoY) in Loans and Advances of NBFCs Source: RBI Note: Data for March 2020, June 2020 and September 2020 is provisional. 4.36 NBFCs1 witnessed slowdown in their growth in 2019-20 largely due to isolated credit events in few large NBFCs and challenges in accessing funds. Total assets of NBFCs had increased from ` 23.41 lakh crore in March 2018 to ` 29.23 lakh crore in March 2019, and further to ` 33.91 lakh crore in March 2020, resulting in an annual growth of 16.01 per cent during 2019-20 as compared with 24.86 per cent in 2018-19. Banks continued to support NBFCs with their lending expanding 9.2 per cent (YoY) till October 2020, well above the overall bank credit growth. The sector also benefitted from the liquidity infusing measures announced by the Reserve Bank during the pandemic that also included Tar geted Long-Term Repo (TLTRO) Operations covering the NBFC sector . 4.37 There was some shift in sources of funding for the NBFC sector in 2019-20. Banks' total exposure to NBFCs increased from ` 7.01 lakh crores in March 2019 to ` 8.04 lakh crores in March 2020, and further to ` 8.17 lakh crores in June 2020. Bank credit to the NBFC sector was ` 7.05 lakh crore in June 2020, which comprised around 6.6 per cent of total banking credit. However, mutual funds lending to NBFCs continued to contract in 2020-21 as well (Figure 15). 1 The sector represents top 250 NBFCs, based on their asset size as of June 2020.142 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 1 Figure 15: Growth in mutual fund lending to NBFCs Source: SEBI 4.38 The external liabilities of NBFCs in the form of secured and unsecured borrowings and public deposits increased by 13.7 per cent on YoY basis in June 2020. Borrowings from other financial institutions increased from ` 69,965 crore in March 2020 to ` 1,11,841 crore in June 2020, resulting in a YoY growth of around 226 per cent. Further, borrowings through Commercial Paper (CPs) also increased from ` 71,734 crore in March 2020 to ` 95,439 crore in June 2020. 4.39 Cost of funds for all types of borrowings by NBFCs marginally declined in June 2020, compared to March 2020 or June 2019, except for Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs). Cost of NCDs, which contribute to major source of funds for NBFCs, increased marginally from 8.1 per cent in March 2020 to 8.2 per cent in June 2020. On the other hand, cost of CPs had declined from 7.0 per cent to 5.9 per cent during the same period. 4.40 As against the regulatory requirement of 15 per cent, CRAR for the NBFC sector stood at 22.05 per cent at the end of June 2020, showing improvement over March 2020 when it was 20.62 per cent. Asset quality of NBFCs deteriorated moderately with GNPA ratio at 6.44 per cent at the end of June 2020 as against 6.30 per cent as at end-March 2020 and 5.60 per cent as at end-March 2019. However, Net NPA ratio improved marginally to 2.99 per cent at the end of June 2020 as against 3.09 per cent in March 2020. RoA for the NBFC sector was 0.4 per cent in June 2020 as compared with 0.6 per cent in June 2019, while RoE was 1.7 per cent in June 2020 as compared to 2.6 per cent in June 2019. 143 Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation Box 2: Digital payments Financial transactions have been seeing high growth over the last few years. This financial year has witnessed jumps in both volume and value of digital payments across all categories. Overall transactions worth ` 19.35 lakh crore have been done via UPI and ` 1.02 lakh crore via RuPay cards in 2020-21 (upto October). Figure A. UPI payments (in ` billion) Figure B. RuPay Card usage (in ` billion) Source: NPCI Reserve Bank of India has constructed a composite Digital Payments Index (DPI) to capture the extent of digitisation of payments across the country. The RBI-DPI comprises of 5 broad parameters that enable measurement of deepening and penetration of digital payments in the country over different time periods. These parameters are: (i) Payment Enablers (weight 25%), (ii) Payment Infrastructure - Demand-side factors (10%), (iii) Payment Infrastructure - Supply-side factors (15%), (iv) Payment Performance (45%) and (v) Consumer Centricity (5%). The RBI-DPI has been constructed with March 2018 as the base period, i.e. DPI score for March 2018 is set at 100. The DPI for March 2019 and March 2020 work out to 153.47 and 207.84 respectively, indicating high growth over the years. The index has grown more than 100 per cent in a span of 2 years. DEVELOPMENTS IN CAPITAL MARKETS 1. Primary Markets (Equity) A. Public Issue 4.41 The year 2020-212 (upto December) witnessed an increase in resource mobilization through public issue compared to the similar period for previous year. During April-December 2020, although the number of companies raising money through public issue reduced to 33 from 49 in the same period last year, ` 31,086.64 crore were mobilised during this period as compared to ` 10,950 crore in the similar period of previous year indicating an increase of 183.9 per cent in resource mobilization over the period. Similarly, resource mobilization through rights issues during 2020-21(upto December) increased to ` 60,906.90 crore from 16 rights issues as compared to ` 51,865.86 crore from 13 issues in April-December (T able 7). 2 Date for 2020-21 is provisional144 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 1 Table 7: Primary Market Resource Mobilization through Public and Rights Issues Issue Type2019-20 (upto December) 2020-21 (upto December) e)No. of IssuesAmount (` cror e) Public Issue (Equity) 49 10,949.99 33 31,086.64 Rights Issue (Equity) 13 51,865.86 16 60,906.90 Total Public Issue 62 62,815.85 49 91,993.54 Source: BSE, NSE and SEBI B.

Prior to this legislation, India did not have a legal framework for bilateral netting. Netting enables two counter parties in a bilateral financial contract to offset claims against each other to determine a single net payment obligation due from one counter party to others. Besides aiding the stability of the financial markets, bilateral netting will help in development of corporate debt market in India and freeing the capital in the system. 3. Mutual Fund Activities 4.46 There was a net inflow of `2.76 lakh crore into the mutual funds industry during 2020-21 (upto December), as compared to a net inflow of `1.82 lakh crore in the corresponding period of last year. The net assets under management of all mutual funds increased by 16.9 per cent to `31.02 lakh crore at the end of December 31, 2020 from `26.54 lakh crore at the end of December 31, 2019 (Table 1 1).

There were some significant corrections due to COVID-19 induced uncertainty in the beginning of this financial year, however both Nifty50 and S&P BSE Sensex index recovered strongly afterwards. The S&P BSE Sensex, the benchmark index of BSE, rose by 68.9 per cent to 49,792.1 on January 20,2021, compared to 29,468 on March 31, 2020. During the same period, Nifty 50 index of National Stock Exchange (NSE) gained by 70.3 percent from March 31, 2020 to January 20, 2021 (Figure 16 (a)). India VIX, an index circulated by NSE which indicates the degree of fluctuation that can be expected in Nifty 50 index by active traders over the next 30 days has fallen considerably since March 2020, indicating decline in volatility in stock market.

In the period of moratorium by the RBI, if CRA is of the view that the delay in payment of interest/ principle has arisen solely due to the lockdown, CRAs may not consider the same as a default event and/or recognize default. Further, extension in timelines for press release and disclosures on website was also provided. CRAs were provided flexibility to deviate from the curing period of 90 days for upgrading a rating from default to non-investment grade. SEBI granted temporary relaxation in processing of documents pertaining to FPIs by allowing designated depository participants/ custodians to process the request(s) for registration/ continuance/ KYC / KYC review & any other material change on the basis of scanned version of signed documents (instead of originals) and copies of documents which are not certified, received from specified email ids. Also, relaxations were provided in terms of pre-listing and post-listing compliance related to financials for the listed issuers of non-convertible debentures non-convertible redeemable preference shares and commercial papers. INSURANCE SECTOR 4.50 The performance and potential of insurance sector is assessed using two indicators- Insurance penetration and Insurance Density. Insurance penetration is calculated as percentage of insurance premium to GDP and insurance density is calculated as ratio of insurance premium to population. 4.51 In India, Insurance penetration which was 2.71 per cent in 2001 has steadily increased to 3.76 per cent in 2019. In contrast, insurance penetration in Asia, i.e., Malaysia, Thailand and China was 4.72, 4.99 and 4.30 per cent respectively in 2019. As of 2019, the penetration for Life insurance in India is 2.82 per cent, the penetration for Non-Life insurance is much at 0.94 per cent (Table 12 and 13). Globally insurance penetration was 3.35 per cent for the life segment 148 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 1 and 3.88 per cent for the non-life segment in 2019. Although the penetration is lower in India for both, it is particularly low for Non-life insurance as compared to other countries (Figure 17). 4.52 The insurance density in India which was US$ 11.5 in 2001 reached to approximately US$ 78 in 2019. The comparative figures for Malaysia, Thailand and China in 2019 were much higher at US$ 536, US$ 389 and US$ 430 respectively. Density for Life insurance is US$ 58 and Non- Life insurance is much lower at US$ 19 in 2019 in India (Table 12 and 13). Globally insurance density was US$ 379 for the life segment and US$ 439 for the non-life segment respectively in 2019. United States has particularly high insurance density in the Non-life category. India has extremely low insurance penetration as compared to global average and other comparable countries (Figure 18).

Within non-life category, motor and health segments primarily are the main contributors to industry to report this growth. Life insurance industry recorded a premium income of ` 5.73 lakh crore in 2019-20, as against ` 5.08 lakh crore in the previous financial year, registering a growth of 12.75 per cent. While renewal premium accounted for 54.75 per cent of the total premium received by the life insurers, new business contributed the remaining 45.25 per cent. 4.54 Some important regulatory measures undertaken due to COVID-19 are as follows: KYC process has been simplified with the permission granted for 54 insurers to undertake Paperless KYC process through Aadhaar Authentication Services of UIDAI. Guidelines were issued on introduction of short term health insurance policies providing coverage for COVID-19 disease which are valid upto March 31,2021. As per the guidelines 1) All life, general and health insurers allowed to offer COVID - 19 specific short-term health insurance policies, 2) Policy term of minimum of 3 months and maximum of 11 months 3) life insurers are permitted to issue benefit-based policies only, General and Health insurers can issue both indemnity based and benefit based 4) Insurers shall comply with pricing norms specifies under 2016 HI regulations and guidelines issued thereunder 5) Waiting period shall not exceed 15 days, no separate add-ons are permitted. Lifelong renewability, migration and portability not applicable. Guidelines were issued for Corona Rakshak policy which is a standard benefit-based policy and Corona Kavach Policy, a standard health policy which will be offered on indemnity basis and insurers had been asked to launch the product from July 10, 2020.150 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 1 PENSION SECTOR 4.55 The overall contribution under NPS grew by more than 30 per cent. Maximum growth was registered by All-Citzen model/ UoS (52.3 per cent) followed by APY (46.1 per cent), Corporate Sector (34.8 per cent) and State Govt. Sector (30.7 per cent). The Assets Under Management (AUM) of NPS stands at ` 4.94 lakh crore as on September 30, 2020, as compared to ` 3.71 lakh crore at the end of September, 2019, thereby recording an overall growth (YoY) of 33.3 per cent (Table 14). The maximum growth was recorded under APY i.e. 49.2 per cent over the year, followed by All-Citizen/UoS (45.8 per cent), Corporate Sector (39.6 per cent) and State Government Sector (33.9 per cent).

Since the inception of the Code in December 2016, 4,117 applications have been admitted as on December 31, 2020 (Figure 19). Nearly 23 per cent of the cases admitted were settled or withdrawn after the commencement of Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP). Out of the 1420 cases for which the CIRP process has been completed, liquidation as an outcome has happened nearly 3.6 times the resolution. However, this does not represent an accurate picture of the performance of the Code. This is because 73 per cent (799 cases) of cases undergoing liquidation and 33 per cent of cases (101 cases) undergoing resolution had been brought in from earlier Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) regime. Most of these cases have been considered to be dead corpus with most of the net worth being eroded by the time they entered CIRP. Having been able to revive 101 of such cases is an achievement in itself. The CIRP for non-BIFR legacy has yielded 195 resolutions and 288 liquidations till date. This also means that the resolution rate for non-BIFR legacy cases is more than three times higher at 40 per cent when compared to BIFR cases (Figure 20). Figure 19: Status of CIRPs since its inception (as on December 30, 2020) Source: IBBI Figure 20: CIRP Source: IBBI 4.58 The ongoing CIRPs at the end of March 2020 were 1966 (Figure 21). In view of COVID-19 pandemic, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 was promulgated on June 5, 2020 which suspended initiation of the CIRP of a corporate debtor (CD) under section 7, 152 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 1 9 and 10 for any default arising on or after March 25, 2020. Further, the government extended the suspension of the Code twice for 3 months each on September 24, 2020 and December 22, 2020 to provide relief to the firms undergoing stress due to ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The relaxation combined with continued resolutions has allowed the number of cases to decline since July 2020. Figure 21: CIRP accumulation over time Source: IBBI 4.59 Manufacturing Sector, Real Estate and Construction are among the top three sectors initiating CIRP (Figure 22) with 39 per cent, 20 per cent and 11 per cent of the ongoing CIRPs respectively. Figure 22: Sector-wise status of CIRPs (as on December 2020) Source: IBBI153 Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation 4.60 Resolution: The Code has rescued 308 CDs as on December 2020 through resolution plans. They owed ` 4.99 lakh crore to creditors. However, the realisable value of the assets available with them, when they entered the CIRP, was only ` 1.03 lakh crore. Under the Code, the creditors recovered ` 1.99 lakh crore, which is more than 193 per cent of the realisable value of these CDs. The recovery for financial creditors (FCs), as compared to their claims, was found to be more than 43 per cent for all the years since the inception of the Code. The Code has facilitated the recovery of NPAs by banks. RBI data indicates that as a percentage of claims, scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) have been able to recover 45.5 per cent of the amount involved through IBC for the financial year 2019-20, which is the highest as compared to recovery under other modes and legislations (Figure 23). Further, the amount recovered by SCBs under IBC was ` 1.73 lakh crores which is more than all the amount recovered by all other alternative mechanisms combined for 2019-20. Figure 23: NPAs of SCBs Recovered through Off-site returns, RBI and IBBI Note: P: Provisional Box 2. Status of Twelve large accounts Since a few cases accounted for a large proportion of money involved in the resolution process, the resolution process of 12 large accounts was initiated by banks, as directed by RBI in June 2017. Togethe r they had an outstanding claim of ` 3.45 lakh crore as against liquidation value of ` 73,220 crores. Of these, resolution plan in respect of eight CDs have been approved and orders for liquidation have been passed in respect of two CDs. Thus, CIRPs for two firms and liquidation in respect of two firms are ongoing and are at different stages of the process. The status of the 12 lar ge accounts is presented in Table A.154 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 1 Table A: Status of Twelve Large Accounts (Amount in ` cror e) Name of CD Claims of FCs Dealt Under ResolutionRealisation by all Claimants as a percentage of Liquidation ValueSuccessful Resolution Applicant Amount AdmittedAmount RealisedRealisation as % 1 15.39 Reliance Industries Limited, JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd., JMFARC - March 2018 Trust Jyoti Structures Limited7,365 3,691 Process Era Infra Engineering Limited Under CIRP Lanco Infratech Limited Under Liquidation ABG Shipyard Limited Under Liquidation Source: IBBI 4.61 Liquidation - Although the Code has rescued 308 CDs, 11 12 CDs went into liquidation. The CDs rescued had assets valued at ` 1.03 lakh crore, while the CDs (for which data are available) referred for liquidation had assets valued at ` 0.43 lakh crore when they entered the CIRP. Thus, in value terms, around three fourth of distressed assets were rescued. Till 155 Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation December 31, 2020, 181 CDs have been completely liquidated which had outstanding claims of ` 26,251 crores, but the assets valued at `598 crores. ` 607 crores were realised through the liquidation of these companies. 4.62 Time - The 308 CIRPs, which have yielded resolution plans by the end of December 2020, took on average 441 days for the conclusion of the process. Similarly, the 11 12 CIRPs, which ended up in orders for liquidation, took on average 328 days for the conclusion. Further, 181 liquidation processes, which have closed by submission of final reports till December 31, 2020, took on average 380 days for closure. Similarly, 352 voluntary liquidation processes, which have closed by submission of final reports, took on average 370 days for closure. 4.63 Cost - Out of the total 308 CIRPs have yielded resolution plans until December 2020, the cost details are available in respect of 260 CIRPs. The cost works out on average 0.79 per cent of liquidation value and 0.42 per cent of resolution value. Behavioural Change 4.64 The Code has brought about significant behavioural changes among the creditors and debtors thereby redefining debtor-creditor relationship. The inevitable consequence of a resolution process (the control and management of the firm move away from existing promoters and managers, most probably, forever) deters the management and promoter of the firm from operating below the optimum level of efficiency. Further, it encourages the debtors to settle default expeditiously with the creditor at the earliest, preferably outside the Code. There have been many instances where debtors have been settling their debts on their own or settling immediately on the filing of an application with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) before it is admitted. It is pertinent to note that since the enactment of the Code in 2016, of the 18,892 applications that were dealt with, as many as 14,884 cases involving defaults of ` 5.15 lakh crore were withdrawn by September, 2020 from various benches of the NCLT , before these applications were admitted by the Adjudicating Authority and 897 processes were closed mid-way by December, 2020. These figures indicate that almost 83 per cent of the CDs are getting resolved on the way, before the official commencement of CIRP under the Code on account of behavioural change among the defaulting debtors. Only 7 per cent of the CDs have undergone the entire process yielding either resolution or liquidation. Remaining 10 per cent of CDs are still under going the process (T able 15 and 16).

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, inserted section 10A to suspend initiation of the CIRP of a corporate debtor (CD) under section 7, 9 and 10 for any default arising on or after March 25, 2020 which was further extended twice for 3 months each on September 25, 2020 and December 22, 2020. 4 .66 Further, various measures were undertaken by judiciary and the regulator , including: For the matters already under a CIRP in accordance with the provisions of the IBC, the Supreme Court suo moto passed an order extending the limitation period for all matters with ef fect from March 15, 2020 till further orders. The NCLAT , vide order dated March 30, 2020, decided that the period of lockdown ordered by the Central Government and the State Governments shall be excluded for the purpose of counting of the period for resolution process under section 12 of the Code, in all cases where CIRP has been initiated and pending before any Bench of the NCLT or in appeal before NCLAT . It further ordered that any interim order/ stay order passed by the NCLAT in any one or the other appeal under the Code shall continue till next date of hearing.157 Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation IBBI amended the CIRP regulations and Liquidation Process regulations to provide that the period of lockdown imposed by the Central Government in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak shall not be counted for the purposes of time-line for any activity that could not be completed due to the lockdown, in relation to a CIRP and Liquidation process, subject to the overall time-limit provided in the Code. CHAPTER AT A GLANCE Monetary policy remained accommodative in 2020. The repo rate has been cut by 115 bps since March 2020. Systemic liquidity in 2020-21 remained in surplus so far. RBI undertook various conventional and unconventional measures like OMOs, Long Term Repo Operations, Tar geted Long Term Repo Operations etc. to manage liquidity situation in the economy. The transmission of high reserve money growth to money supply growth was only partial, showing impaired liquidity transmission as the banks put money back with RBI under reverse repo. Credit growth of banks slowed down to 6.7 per cent as on January 1, 2021. The credit off take from banking sector witnessed a broad based slowdown. Gross Non Performing Assets ratio of Scheduled Commercial Banks decreased from 8.21 per cent at the end of March 2020 to 7.49 per cent at the end of September 2020. However, this has to be seen in conjunction with the asset classification relief provided to borrowers on account of the pandemic. The monetary transmission of lower policy rates to deposit and lending rates improved in this year. Nifty 50 and S&P BSE Sensex reached record high closing of 14,644.7 and 49,792.12 on January 20, 2021 respectively . The recovery rate for the Scheduled Commercial Banks through IBC (since its inception) has been over 45 per cent. In view of COVID-19 pandemic, initiation of Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) was suspended for any default arising on or after March 25, 2020 for a period of 6 months. This was further extended twice for 3 months on September 24, 2020 and December 22, 2020. The suspension along with continued clearance of CIRPs allowed a small decline in accumulated cases. 158 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 1 ANNEXURE 1 REGULA TORY P OLICY MEASURES IN RESPECT OF BANKS TO MITIGATE THE IMP ACT OF COVID -19 P ANDEMIC Date of Announcement Measures Announced March 27, 2020 (i) Covid-19 Regulatory Package was announced; wherein lending institutions were permitted to grant moratorium and deferment of interest for three months i.e. March 01, 2020 to May 31, 2020 in respect of instalments of term loans and working capital sanctioned in the form of Cash Credit/Overdraft respectively on the outstanding as on March 1, 2020; (ii) The implementation of NSFR guidelines, which were to come into effect from April 1, 2020 onwards was deferred by six months to October 1, 2020 dated March 27, 2020; (iii) The implementation of the last tranche of 0.625 per cent of Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) was deferred from March 31, 2020 to September 30, 2020.

The thresholds for 26 sectors, as recommended by the Expert Committee, were notified whereas the lending institutions were advised to make their own internal assessments in respect of other sectors. September 29, 2020 The implementation of the last tranche of 0.625 per cent of Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) was deferred from September 30, 2020 to April 1, 2021. The implementation of NSFR guidelines, which was to come into effect from October 1, 2020 onwards was deferred by a further period of six months. These guidelines shall now come into ef fect from April 1, 2021. October 16, 2020 The celling for LTV ratios for housing loans sanctioned by banks on or after October 16, 2020 till March 31, 2022 was increased to 90 per cent. October 26, 2020 Reserve Bank advised the lending institutions about the Scheme announced by Government of India for grant of ex-gratia payment of difference between compound interest and simple interest for six months to borrowers in specified loan accounts (1.3.2020 to 31.8.2020) (the 'Scheme') on October 23, 2020.CHAPTER05 Prices and Inflation CPI-Combined (C) inflation has moderated since 2013-14. However, inflation dynamics have changed considerably in 2020. Overall, headline CPI inflation remained high during the COVID-19 induced lockdown period and subsequently, due to the persistence of supply side disruptions. The rise in inflation was mostly driven by food inflation, which increased to 9.1 per cent during 2020-21 (Apr-Dec). Due to COVID-19 induced disruptions, an overall increase in the price momentum is witnessed, driving inflation since April 2020, whereas positive base effect has been a moderating factor. The difference in rural-urban CPI inflation, which was high in 2019, saw a decline from November 2019 that continued in 2020. Inflation ranged between 3.2 per cent to 11 per cent across States/UTs in 2020-21 (Jun-Dec) compared to (-) 0.3 per cent to 7.6 per cent in the same period last year. Thali prices for both vegetarian and non-vegetarian Thalis declined significantly in January-March 2020 before rising sharply during April to November in both rural and urban areas before easing in December 2020. The easing in CPI-C is expected to ease Thali prices going forward. The Survey finds that sole focus on CPI-C inflation may not be appropriate for four reasons. First, food inflation, which contributes significantly to CPI-C is driven primarily by supply-side factors. Second, given its role as the headline target for monetary policy, changes in CPI-C anchor inflation expectations. This occurs despite inflation in CPI-C being driven by supply-side factors that drive food inflation. Third, several components of food inflation are transitory with wide variations within the food and beverages group. Finally, food inflation has been driving overall CPI-C inflation due to the relatively higher weight of food items in the index. While food habits have undergone revisions over the decade since 2011-12, which is base year of CPI, the same is not reflected in the index yet. The base year of CPI therefore needs to be revised to overcome the measurement error that may be arising from the change in food habits. For all these reasons, a greater focus on core inflation is warranted. Further, given the significant increases in e-commerce transactions, new sources of price data capturing e-commerce transactions must get incorporated in the construction of price indices. During the year, the government took several measures to make crucial drugs for COVID-19 treatment available at affordable prices, to stabilise prices of sensitive food items like banning of export of onions, imposition of stock limit on onions, easing of restriction on imports of pulses etc. However, consistency in import policy of sensitive food items warrants attention as frequent changes in import policy of pulses and edible oils adds to confusion and delays. To rein in the vegetable inflation, review of relevant buffer stock policies is essential. To avoid supply-side disruptions that cause inflation seasonality in vegetables, food, CPI-C and in inflation expectations, a system needs to be developed to reduce wastages and ensure timely release of stock.162 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Introduct Ion 5.1 Year 2020 was unprecedented with the global pandemic of COVID-19 induced social distancing disrupting economic activity globally. At the domestic level, two opposing forces were at play. On the one hand, there was a dampening of demand owing to lower economic activity. On the other hand, supply chain disruptions have caused spikes in food inflation that have continued to persist during the unlocking of the economy, though the effect has softened in the recent months. Overall, headline CPI inflation remained high during the lockdown period and subsequently as well, due to the persistence of supply side disruptions (Table 1). At the global level, inflation remained benign on the back of subdued economic activity as a result of COVID-19 outbreak and sharp fall in international crude oil prices in advanced economies. In Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs), there was slight fall in inflation on account of weaker economic activity, though there has been uptick in inflation in some economies ending at similar levels as in the previous year (IMF, 2020) (Figure 1).

Though a rising trend was observed since 2019, a moderation in inflation is clearly visible now (Figure 2). The average CPI-C inflation, which was 5.9 per cent in 2014-15, fell continuously to 3.4 per cent in 2018-19 and recorded 4.8 per cent in 2019-20. It however increased to 6.6 per cent in 2020-21 (Apr-Dec) before easing to a 15-month low of 4.6 per cent in December 2020. Within various groups of CPI-C, the increase in inflation in the current year was mainly driven by rise in food inflation, which increased from 0.1 per cent in 2018-19 to 6.7 per cent in 2019-20 and further to 9.1 per cent in 2020-21 (Apr-Dec), owing to build up in vegetable prices. However, the swift steps taken by the Government eased food inflation significantly to 3.4 per cent in December 2020 from a high of 11 per cent in October 2020. CPI Core (non-food non-fuel) inflation declined from 5.8 per cent in 2018-19 to 4.0 per cent in 2019-20 and averaged 5.4 per cent in 2020-21 (Apr-Dec) (Table 2). Rise in core inflation in the current year is mainly on account of miscellaneous group which primarily consists of services. Inflation in transport & communication, which have maximum weightage in the miscellaneous group, increased to 9.4 per cent in the current year as compared to 2.4 per cent in 2019-20. Further, volatility in gold and silver prices also pushed core inflation up. However, at major group level of CPI-C, significant fall has been observed in housing inflation from 6.7 per cent in 2018-19 to 4.5 per cent in 2019-20 and further to 3.3 per cent in 2020-21 (Apr-Dec).

Note: (P): Provisional, *Consumer Food Price Index, # April to December 2020 5.3 WPI inflation declined from 4.3 per cent in 2018-19 to 1.7 per cent in 2019-20 and further to (-) 0.1 per cent in 2020-21 (Apr-Dec). It remained negative from April to July 2020 and stood at 1.2 per cent in December 2020 (Figure 3). The decline in WPI inflation in the current year is mainly on account of fuel & power. Persistent volatility in the global crude oil prices during the year led to fall in inflation of major fuel products. WPI fuel & power inflation dropped sharply from 11.6 per cent in 2018-19 to (-) 1.8 per cent in 2019-20 and further to (-) 12.2 per cent in 2020-21 (Apr-Dec).

Note: P: Provisional, #April to December 2020. 5.4 The rural-urban difference in CPI inflation, which was high in 2019, saw a decline in 2020. From July 2018 to December 2019, CPI-Urban inflation was consistently above CPI-Rural inflation, mainly on account of the differential rates of food inflation between rural and urban areas witnessed during this period. However, in the current year, CPI-Urban inflation has moved closely with CPI-Rural inflation (Figure 4). Although food inflation in rural and urban areas has almost converged now (Figure 5), divergence in rural-urban inflation is observed in other components of CPI (Figure 6). Inflation in non-food components of CPI is higher in urban areas as compared to rural areas in the current year. While fuel & light inflation is (-) 0.1 per cent in rural areas, it is 6.7 per cent in urban areas. The rural-urban differential in other components is in the range of 1.6 to 2.3 percentage points, except housing, which is not compiled for rural areas.

It measures changes in the retail prices of a fixed basket of goods and services being consumed by an average working-class family. Apart from serving as a guide for policy formulations, 167 Prices and Inflation these index numbers are utilized for fixing/revising wages, regulating the dearness allowances paid to large number of manual workers and Central/ State Govt. employees. To capture the latest consumption pattern of working-class family, Labour Bureau has revised the base year of the existing CPI-IW series 2001=100 to a more recent base year 2016=100. The new series of CPI-IW covers the industrial workers from the existing seven sectors viz. Factories, Mines, Plantation, Railways, Public Motor Transport Undertakings, Electricity Generating & Distributing Establishments and Ports & Docks. The new series has a wider coverage in terms of sample size, number of centres, markets/outlets, items etc. The major changes in the new series are summarized in the following Table.

The revised six groups based on the COICOP classification and their respective weights for different series are as follows. All India group weight distribution for different series of CPI-IW Groups Weights (%) 1982 2001 2016 Food & Beverages* 57.0 46.2 39.17 Pan, Supari, Tobacco & Intoxicants 3.15 Light 100.00 *Food and Beverages was Food Group during previous series. **Clothing and Footwear was Clothing, Bedding and Footwear during previous series. The food & beverages group and the miscellaneous group have been further divided into various sub-groups. The weights for the purpose of compilation of index numbers have been derived on the basis of average monthly family expenditure. The average budget derived from a family budget enquiry consisted of all items of expenditure reported by the families surveyed under Working Class Family Income & Expenditure Survey (WCFI&ES), 2016. The weight of food & beverages has declined over time whereas the weight of miscellaneous 168 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 group (mainly services) has increased substantially under 2016 series vis-\u00e0-vis earlier series. The linking factor for the two series is 2.88. Linking factor allows us to maintain continuity in the time series data on the price index. This would help in comparing the new series with the old one. The linking factor has been derived by taking the ratio of average of monthly indices of old series to new series for the period of 12 months (from September 2019 to August 2020). INFLATION TREND: MOMENTUM AND BASE EFFECT 5.6 Inflation trends are usually interpreted using the twelve-month change in the index to eliminate the effect of seasonal fluctuations. However, one challenge with using the YoY change in inflation is that it does not distinguish between recent price changes and price changes a year before. When changes in the CPI in the base month have a considerable effect on changes in YoY inflation, this is referred to as base effect. Base effects are therefore the contribution to changes in the annual rate of measured inflation from abnormal changes in the CPI in the base period. Hence, we need to distinguish whether changes in inflation are caused by price changes in the current month, or by extreme price changes in the base period (Central Bank of Iceland, 2007). 5.7 Arithmetically, the explanation of why t-1 (YoY inflation in period t-1) moved to t (YoY inflation in period t) consists of two parts: 1. Momentum: why p t-1 moved to pt (month-on-month change in price index). It captures the recent price changes. 2. Base effect: why pt-12 moved from p t-13. It captures the price changes a year ago. 5.8 Thus, the difference between the YoY inflation rates in two subsequent months is ap- proximately the same as the difference between the month-on-month rate in the current month and the month-on-month rate twelve months previously (European Central Bank, 2005). A low-er base effect or higher momentum has a positive impact on the change in inflation. Figure 7: CPI-C and core inflation Source: NSO169 Prices and Inflation 5.9 CPI headline and CPI core inflation from April 2020 to October 2020 was driven mostly by substantial increase in price momentum i.e., increase in recent price index was pushing up the inflation each month (Figure 7). In both cases, positive base effect helped moderate the inflation. A major jump is witnessed in April 2020, with inflation rate increasing from 5.8 per cent in March 2020 to 7.2 per cent in April 2020 and then declining to 6.3 per cent in May 2020. The jump is mainly witnessed on account of sudden and sharp increase in momentum in the month of April 2020, possibly due to the initial disruptions caused by COVID-19 lockdown. By November 2020, price momentum moderated significantly and coupled with positive base effect helped ease inflation. Figure 8: CPI food and beverages and its sub-group inflation Food and Beverages Cereals and products Oils and fatsPulses and products Vegetables170 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Meat and fish Egg Source: NSO 5.10 In the 'food and beverages' group, a similar pattern is observed as in the case of CPI headline and CPI core. In November 2020, decline in price momentum along with high base effect helped ease food inflation (Figure 8). Among the various sub-groups under 'food and beverages' group, different patterns emerge. For example, in case of cereals, since July 2020 the decline in monthly YoY inflation is led by both negative price momentum and positive base effect. In case of oils and fats, the high inflation is mostly driven by substantial jump in price momentum; base effect has been moderate in this case. Even in the case of vegetables, inflation is mostly driven by large increase in price momentum since July 2020. 5.11 In 'transport and communication' and 'personal care and effects', increase in inflation since April 2020 has been a result of sudden jump in price momentum (Figure 9). However, price momentum moderated substantially since August 2020 in 'transport and communication' and turned negative in September 2020 for 'personal care and effects'. Overall, price momentum has dominated the change in inflation during the year. Government has, therefore, rightly intervened in containing inflation, especially in vegetables. Figure 9: CPI Miscellaneous group and its sub groups inflation Miscellaneous171 Prices and Inflation Transport and communication Personal care and effects Source: NSO DRIVERS OF INFLA TION : THE PRODIGIOUS IMP ACT OF FOOD INFLA TION 5.12 During 2019-20 (Apr-Dec) as well as 2020-21 (Apr-Dec), the major driver of CPI-C inflation was the food and beverages group, though its contribution has increased to 59.0 per cent in 2020-21 (Apr-Dec) compared to 53.7 per cent in 2019-20 (Apr-Dec). Miscellaneous group was the second largest contributor to inflation, contributing to 26.8 per cent of overall inflation (Figure 10). Among the sub-groups in miscellaneous group, transport and communication contributed the most followed by personal care and effects. Figure 10: Contribution of groups to overall CPI-C inflation in 2019-20 (Apr-Dec) and 2020-21 (Apr-Dec) in per cent Source: NSO 5.13 Food inflation based on CFPI which remained negative from October 2018 to February 2019, showed a sharp increase since the second half of 2019, mainly due to surge in vegetable prices, before declining in the recent months. High food inflation since March, 2020 is indicative of supply chain bottlenecks owing to COVID-19 induced disruptions. The contribution of food 172 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 sub-groups to fats' and 'pulses &products' were the major contributors to food inflation in the current year (Figure 11). Contribution of vegetables turned negative in December 2020 owing to sharp fall in vegetable prices. Cereals, which contributed highly to food inflation in June 2020, has declined continuously since then. Figure 11: Contribution of food sub-groups to CFPI Source: NSO. 5.14 Inflation in vegetables remained elevated during the period September 2019 to April 2020. It declined to 4 per cent in June 2020 and remained in double digits from July to November 2020. The rise in vegetables inflation was mainly on account of rise in prices of potatoes and onions during the lean season. In the case of onion, arrivals declined by 74 per cent in April 2020 and by 62 per cent in case of potatoes in August 2020. However, immediate steps have been taken by the Government to contain the price rise of these items, resulting in a steep decline in vegetables inflation to (-)10.4 per cent in December 2020. 5.15 Apart from vegetables, inflation in some of the protein rich items like egg, meat & fish and pulses & products remained elevated in the current year, thereby contributing significantly to food inflation. The only exception was inflation in milk & products which declined continuously from 9.4 per cent in April 2020 to 4.0 per cent in December 2020. Inflation in meat & fish has remained in double digits in most part of the current year mainly on account of rise in prices of chicken and mutton. After reaching peak in April 2020, inflation in pulses & products declined, before rising to 18.3 per cent in October 2020 and then declined to 16.0 per cent in December 2020. However, lately, inflation in all these items has declined (Figure 12). 5.16 Further, inflation in oils & fats and spices has shown a rising trend in the current year. However, sizeable drop in inflation since April 2020 has been observed for some of the major food groups like cereals & products which declined from 7.8 per cent in April 2020 to 1.0 per cent in December 2020, and sugar which declined from 10.3 per cent in April 2020 to 0.5 per cent in December 2020 (Figure 13).173 Prices and Inflation Figure 12: CPI inflation in protein rich items Source: NSO Figure 13: CPI inflation in other major food groups Source: NSO 5.17 Pulses inflation has been above 5 per cent since June 2019 and has been on an upward trend since then. In April 2020, a sudden spike was observed and inflation touched 22.8 per cent likely due to the disruptions caused by COVID-19 related restrictions and stocking of pulses by households during the lockdown. Although production of total pulses has increased in 2019-20 and 2020-21, at item level, production of urad has declined significantly in 2019-20 compared to the previous year. Production of moong was stable in 2019-20. Production of lentils was also lower in 2019-20. Further, the estimated production of pulses in 2019-20 and 2020-21 has been less than the target. At item level, all pulses except split-gram recorded double-digit CPI 174 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 inflation in December 2020. However, in December 2020, inflation of all pulses, except peas and 'other pulses' declined as compared to the previous month. 5.18 Imports can add to the availability of any commodity and thus moderate prices in case of shortfalls in domestic supply. In the case of pulses, it is seen that import is highly negatively correlated with production (Figure 14). In the year of low production, import increases and in the year of bumper crop, imports fall. Each year, import policy is changed according to the level of production. However, such frequent changes in import policy adds to confusion of market participants owing to uncertainty in policy regime. Figure 14: Production, import and import production ratio Source: CMIE 5.19 CPI inflation in oils and fats has been increasing since August 2019 and has reached 20 per cent in December 2020. While inflation in mustard oil, groundnut oil and refined oil (sunflower, soyabean etc.) is above 20 per cent, coconut oil is above 10 per cent in December 2020. India is the largest importer of edible oils. Demand for edible oils is rising in India, while 175 Prices and Inflation domestic production is almost stagnant, due to which dependence on imports has increased over the years (Figure 15). This is risky as problems in the world market may have serious repercussions on the domestic market. Effective measures to increase domestic production are necessary to reduce import dependency (CACP, 2020). Imports in 2020 were affected as Malaysia and Indonesia imposed export tariffs on crude palm oil. This affected domestic prices of palm oil from Jan-Jun 2020. Figure 15: Import of edible oils *Till September Source: Solvent Extractors Association of India. 5.20 Escalation in wholesale prices was also witnessed after the COVID-19 induced restrictions possibly because of labour shortages on account of reverse migration, social distancing in factories, and other transaction costs in the production and distribution network. Although production of total oilseeds is estimated to have increased in 2019-20 and 2020-21, production of soyabean has declined significantly in 2019-20. The kharif production of sunflower for 2020-21 is estimated to have declined as compared to the previous year. The production of sunflower has been declining continuously over the years, and only a marginal increase has been observed in 2019-20. Production of mustard also has declined in 2019-20. 5.21 The variations in the prices of essential food commodities are experienced by the common man through its impact on the households' food budget. An attempt was made in this regard to assess the cost of a plate of food in V ol-I, Economic Survey, 2019-20 in the form of Thalinomics (Box 2). 176 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Box 2: Thalinomics: Cost of a plate of food in 2020-21 The Economic Survey, 2019-20 V olume-I put forth a novel concept of a thali in the Chapter titled \"Thalinomics\": The Economics of a Plate of Food in India. Using the methodology prescribed in the chapter and using the recommended dietary allowances of cereal, pulses/meat, vegetable, spices, edible oil and fuel based on the dietary guidelines prescribed for an Indian adult male heavy worker (NIN, 2011), the NSO has compiled the Thali index using the data collected by NSO for CPI-C. The State-wise shares within cereals, pulses etc. are decided as per the Consumption Expenditure Survey 68 th Round data (2011-12). PDS prices for both rural and urban sectors and prices of items canvassed in respect of affluent markets in urban areas, have been excluded. It may be noted that excluding PDS consumption does have some challenges. Thali cost represents the cost of a meal cooked within household but as it excludes PDS consumption is wholly based on the transactional prices of the said components of thali, it may be true that the actual cost for a real household may differ from that computed here and may be dependent on the efficacy of the PDS system in a State. The following figures shows the trends in thali cost at All-India level for Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian thalis since April 2019. While Thali cost have increased between June 2020 and November 2020, they witnessed a sharp fall in the month of December reflecting the fall in the prices of many essential food commodities. All-India Thali Costs Source: NSO Note: 1. Thali cost for the months of April, 2020 & May, 2020 are not compiled as sufficient price data was not available due to lockdown situation of COVID-19 pandemic. 2. Thali cost represents the cost of a meal cooked within household but excludes PDS consumption and may therefore differ from the actual cost for a real household. Thali costs displayed much variation among the states. In 2020-21(Jun-Dec, 2020), the most expensive Veg thali in the rural areas was in Andaman & Nicobar Islands ( ` 38.7) while the cheapest in rural areas was in Uttar Pradesh ( ` 23.1). In terms of Non-Veg thali 177 Prices and Inflation during the same period, the most expensive was in Arunachal Pradesh ( ` 48.5) while cheapest was in Chandigarh ( ` 29.9) in rural areas. In 2020-21(Jun-Dec, 2020), the most expensive Veg thali in the urban areas was in Andaman & Nicobar Islands ( ` 40.0) while the cheapest was in Pradesh ( ` 24.0). In terms of Non-Veg thali during the same period, the most expensive was in Mizoram ( ` 52.4) while cheapest was in Haryana (` 28.0) in urban areas.

INFLATION IN STATES 5.22 CPI-C inflation increased in most of the states in the current year. However, regional variation persists. Inflation ranged between 3.2 per cent to 11 per cent across States/UTs in 2020-21 (Jun-Dec) compared to (-) 0.3 per cent to 7.6 per cent in the same period last year. In 17 States/UTs, overall inflation is below the all-India average in the current year with Delhi having the lowest inflation, followed by Dadra & Nagar Haveli (Figure 16). 179 Prices and Inflation Figure 16: CPI- Combined inflation for States/UTs (in per cent) Source: NSO Notes: 1.

For eg, for Maharashtra, it is 13.2% and for Kerala, it is 4.6%.181 Prices and Inflation WHICH MEASURE OF INFLATION REFLECT ED ECONOMIC ACTIVIT y BETTER IN 2020-21? 5.26 The previous two sections indicate the role of supply-side constraints, especially in the case of perishable vegetables contributing to inflation. Since February 2017, CPI-C inflation and WPI inflation have been moving more or less in tandem till beginning of 2019-20. After this period, gap has emerged, which has widened in the recent months (Figure 19). Between April-July 2020, WPI inflation has been in the negative region while CPI-C inflation has been above 6 per cent. The major feature in this widening gap is that this has happened in a period witnessing high food inflation. The shaded region in Figure 19 shows the period during which CFPI inflation has remained higher than non-food inflation. The movement in CPI-C inflation is quite contrary to the weak demand conditions prevalent in the economy in the recent months owing to the COVID-19 crisis. Food items have a large weight of around 39 per cent in the CPI-C index. This means that shocks to food prices can have large impacts on CPI-C inflation. 5.27 For the period April 2020 to November 2020, CPI-C is weakly related to IIP growth while WPI inflation and CPI-C Core inflation are positively and strongly related to IIP growth. Therefore, core CPI-C inflation and WPI Inflation, have been more in sync with the demand conditions in the economy. During the period April 2020 to November 2020, the correlation coefficient between WPI inflation and YoY growth in IIP is around 0.8 while the correlation coefficient between CPI-C core inflation and IIP growth has been 0.9. The correlation between Figure 19: CPI-C and WPI Inflation Source: NSO and OEA, DPIIT Note: The shaded region in the graph represents the period where Consumer Food Price Inflation has been higher than Non-Food inflation182 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 IIP growth and CPI inflation during the same period is 0.2. Similarly, we can see high correlation of CPI Core inflation and WPI inflation with other metrics of production and demand in the Indian economy (Table 5). Table 5: Correlation of production/demand metrics with CPI-C, Core and WPI Inflation in 2020-21 # CPI-C Inflation CPI-C Non-food vehicle registration* -0.27 Overall Growth of Eight Core Industries 0.20 0.90 0.75 Growth of Coal 0.65 0.62 0.86 Growth of Crude Oil 0.11 0.57 0.56 Growth of Natural Gas 0.19 0.97 0.77 Growth of Petroleum Refinery Products -0.06 0.61 0.51 Growth of Fertilizers -0.43 0.42 -0.10 Growth 0.14 0.89 0.71 Growth of Cement -0.08 0.79 0.45 Growth 2020 April-December, 2020 Source: Tractor and Mechanization Association, V AHAN Dashboard, Office of Economic Adviser, DPIIT and NSO 5.28 A tight monetary policy may have a role in managing inflation in case of excess demand driving high inflation. However, the current scenario presents a different picture. The current spike in CPI inflation driven by spike in food prices is mainly a supply-side phenomenon. This can be easily assessed from the fact that arrivals in the market, for agricultural commodities like onion, tomato and potato that have witnessed spikes in recent times, have been much lower compared to the previous years (Figure 20). Further, the weights of all items in CPI-C are based on NSO Household Consumption Expenditure Survey 2011-12. Weight of food items in the index might have significantly decreased over the decade since 2011-12. There is a need to capture the revised weight of food items in the index to correctly depict the true 183 Prices and Inflation picture of inflation in the country. Further, in the context of increasing retail e-commerce transactions, it is important to include such new sources of price data for the construction price indices. Figure 20: Market arrivals of Onion, Tomato and Potato Source: CMIE Box 3: Headline inflation or core inflation as target for monetary policy Core inflation (inflation in the price index excluding food, fuel and other volatile components) has been viewed by many as the better measure of inflation for monetary policy purposes. This is because food and fuel price shocks are transitory as well as 184 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 mainly supply driven and therefore not a monetary phenomenon. Theoretical work in the area has used models with price and/or wage stickiness to show that targeting core inflation maximizes welfare. When prices are sticky, mark-ups fluctuate and therefore also distort relative prices. In these models, the flexible price equilibrium is restored by central banks trying to minimize these fluctuations by targeting sticky prices. Much of the literature assumes that markets are complete, allowing households to fully insure against idiosyncratic risks. However, in the case of developing economies there are two deviations from these assumptions: 1) inability of agents to smooth their lifetime consumption, and 2) other structural differences such as a high share of food in household consumption expenditure (Anand et al., 2015). Anand et al. (2015) contend that while under complete markets, the choice of targeting strict core inflation is the best policy, with incomplete markets, headline inflation targeting is welfare improving relative to core inflation targeting. However, using a setup similar to Anand et al. (2015), Portillo et al. (2016) find that core (non-food) inflation stabilisation is very close to optimal even in the case of an economy with credit constrained consumers. Portillo et al. (2016) find that an optimal measure of inflation targeting should provide very low weight to food inflation. This weighting is much lower than the weightage of food in Headline CPI. A recent RBI working paper (Nadhanael, 2020), analyses weekly price data on 45 food items in India, for the period 2005-18, from the data collected by the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. The paper finds heterogeneity in the extent of price stickiness among food products. The prices of food items change, on average, in 1.29 months. Vegetable prices change at higher frequency than others (almost twice a month on average), price of pulses changes thrice almost every 2 months, the price of milk changes once in five months, and prices of eggs, meat and fish change on average once a month, prices of cereals change once almost every three and a half months. Given this finding of wide variations in the price stickiness of food items, the paper suggests that it is important to pay attention to the sticky component of food inflation in addition to core inflation. INFLATION EXPECTATIONS 5.29 The one year ahead inflation expectation for CPI-C inflation has risen during the current year . As per the business inflation expectations survey of Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Ahmedabad, one year ahead inflation expectations for CPI-C inflation slightly rose from 4.0 per cent in February 2020 to 4.4 per cent in October 2020. Inflation expectations survey of households conducted by RBI also pointed to a slight rise in inflation expectations from 9.1 per cent in March 2020 to 9.7 per cent in November 2020, though it was lower compared to September 2020. The movement in the inflation expectations have been roughly in the direction of movement of the current inflation rate as measured by CPI-C (Figure 21). This has an important implication with respect to the CPI-C being an important metric for monetary policy. Owing to being a metric of price change that households can relate to it targeting headline inflation can anchor inflation expectations.185 Prices and Inflation Figure 21: One year ahead inflation expectations and current inflation Source: IIM Ahmedabad; RBI, NSO GLOBAL COMMODIT y PRICES 5.30 The YoY growth in global commodity prices, except prices of precious metals and fertilizers, saw a decline from their levels in December 2019, between January and April 2020 owing to COVID-19 induced restrictions around the world and consequent fall in demand for these commodities after remaining subdued during 2019. The largest impact of COVID-19 has been on energy prices driven by fall in crude oil prices. Energy prices have seen some rebound since the pandemic owing to production cuts by OPEC+ countries (World Bank, 2020b), though they continue to be below levels of the previous year. Agricultural prices remained more or less stable during the period of pandemic induced restrictions. This may be attributed to the lower income elasticity of demand for these commodities compared to other commodities (World Bank, 2020a). Growth in prices of agricultural commodities, metals and minerals and fertilizers have now returned to the positive territory (Figure 22). Edible oil prices have been a major driving force in putting upward pressures on agriculture prices. Metal prices have risen owing to higher industrial demand from China (World Bank, 2020b). The average growth in energy index stood at (-) 35.1 per cent in 2020-21 (Apr-Dec) compared to (-) 14.7 per cent in 2019-20 (Apr-Dec). On the other hand, average growth in agriculture index was 5.2 per cent in 2020-21 (Apr-Dec) compared to (-) 3.2 per cent in 2019-20 (Apr-Dec). Precious metals saw a 28.9 per cent growth in 2020-21 (Apr-Dec) compared to 12.5 per cent in 2019-20 (Apr-Dec). 5.31 Gold prices saw sharp spike in prices during 2020. Gold prices rose as investors turned to gold as a safe haven investment amid COVID-19 induced economic uncertainties (Figure 23). Global Economic Policy Uncertainty (GEPU) Index is constructed using information from newspaper articles and proxies policy related economic uncertainty (Baker et al., 2016). From January 2020 onwards, gold prices have sharply increased with the sharp rise in the GEPU. In fact, compared to other assets, gold had returns during the year that were considerably higher (Figure 24).186 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Figure 22: Trends in international commodity prices ( yoy growth) Note: 1.

National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA), which is an independent regulator for pricing of drugs and to ensure availability and accessibility of medicines at affordable prices, has played an active role in addressing the exigencies arising out of COVID-19 pandemic and undertook necessary measures to ensure continued availability of life saving essential medicines throughout the country. It invoked extraordinary powers in public interest to ensure that policy enhances access to life saving drugs like Heparin and Medical Oxygen. NPPA has revised upward the ceiling price of Heparin, a Scheduled Drug, included in the COVID -19 T reatment Protocol for a period of six months to ensure its continued availability during the pandemic. NPPA also invoked extraordinary powers in public interest under Drug Price control Order, 2013 and National Disaster Management Act to cap the price of Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) and the Oxygen Inhalation (Medicinal gas) for six months. Timely intervention by NPPA eased the situation of Medical Oxygen availability throughout the country, especially in distant and far-flung areas. In order to ensure availability of N95 mask at affordable prices in the country, NPPA, directed Manufacturers/ Importers/Suppliers of N95 mask to maintain parity in prices for non-government procurements and to make available the same at reasonable prices. After issuing such an advisory, major manufacturers/importers of N95 masks have reduced their prices significantly up to 67 per cent. NPPA fine-tuned its interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic to strike at profiteering tendencies by manufacturers/marketers in public interest. At the same time it also ensured enabling ecosystem for the industry to augment production of quality benchmarked medical devices for domestic use and exports.188 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 5.33 During the pandemic period, the government constituted an Inter-Ministerial Empowered Com mittee to make recommendation for the export of drugs/items requested by foreign governments especially drugs like Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and Paracetamol. NPPA coordinated with drug manufacturers of these medicines and created a master database and reporting framework for production and supply of these medicines. Based on the recommendations of Empowered Committee, Department of Pharmaceuticals/NPPA issued recommendation/orders which enabled the MEA/DGFT to fulfill various export commitments towards 114 countries in respect of HCQ and 24 countries in respect of Paracetamol, including SAARC Nations. On the intervention of Empowered Committee, during March-May 2020, the number of manufacturing units of Hydroxychloroquine increased from 2 to 12 and the country's production capacity of Hydroxychloroquine has increased three times i.e., from approximately 10 crore tablets per month to approximately 30 crore tablets per month. Currently, India is having surplus of Hydroxychloroquine tablets over and above its domestic requirements. NHB RESIDEX 5.34 The Housing Price Indices (HPIs) are a broad measure of movement of residential property prices observed within a geographic boundary. The National Housing Bank (NHB) RESIDEX captures two housing price indices viz. HPI@ Assessment Prices and HPI@ Market Prices - Under Construction Properties based on the data available for 50 cities with quarterly updation. The Composite HPI@Assessment Prices which stood at 83 in June 2013 has moved up to 112 in the quarter ending September 2020. The index has moved up with a compound annual growth rate of 4.2 per cent over the years. The Composite HPI@ Market Prices for Under Construction Properties which stood at 85 in June 2013 has steadily moved up to 104 in the quarter ending September 2020. The index has moved up with a CAGR of 2.8 per cent over the years. The total number of transactions for HPI@Assessment Price reduced by 71 per cent from March 20 to June 20 on Q-o-Q basis while on YoY basis transactions reduced by 67 per cent from June 19 to June 20, indicating that COVID-19 crisis has significantly impacted the residential real estate market. New listings were down significantly and buyers also reduced their home buying activity. During the quarter July 2020 to September 2020, transactions for HPI@Assessment Prices have increased by around 150 per cent on Q-o-Q basis, thus, it is observed that sales have retrieved in affordable segments, reflecting economic recovery in the real estate sector. MEASURES TO CONTROL INFLATION 5.35 The Government reviews the price situation regularly and has taken number of measures from time to time to stabilize prices of food items. In the wake of rising prices of pulses, onion and potato, the Government has taken several steps to improve the availability of these commodities and make them available to consumers at affordable prices. These include: i. Banning the export of onion w.e.f. 14.09.2020, revoked w.e.f. 1.01.2021. ii. Imposition of stock limit on onion under the EC Act w.e.f. 23.10.2020 to prevent hoarding, lapsed 31.12.2020. iii. Easing of restrictions on imports, facilitating imports at integrated check-posts, issuance of licenses for imports and reduction in import duties. These measures have resulted in increased imports of onion, tur dal and masur dal in the country and resultant cooling of prices. 189 Prices and Inflation Other measures to control undue price rise include: 1. Price Stabilization Fund (PSF) Scheme is being efficiently implemented and has succeeded in achieving its objective of stabilizing prices of pulses and offered significant benefits to all stakeholders. Government in 2016 has approved creation of a dynamic buffer of up to 20 lakh tonnes of pulses for appropriate market intervention. A buffer stock of 20.5 lakh tonnes of pulses was built through both domestic procurement of 16.7 lakh tonnes by Food Corporation of India (FCI), National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED) and Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) during November 2015 to July 2017, and imports of 3.8 lakh tonnes by Metals and Minerals Trading Corporation (MMTC) and State Trading Corporation of India (STC). Domestic procurement for the buffer was done from farmers and farmers' association during Kharif Marketing Seasons (KMS) of 2015-16 and 2016-17 as well as Rabi Marketing Seasons (RMS) of 2016-17 and 2017-18, benefitting about 8.5 lakh farmers. Last import was contracted in November 2016, i.e., up to period when domestic availability was low during 2015-16 and 2016-17. 2. Government has taken a decision that all Ministries/Department having schemes with nutrition component or providing food/ catering/hospitality services would utilize pulses from the central buffer. Pulses from the buffer are utilised for PDS distribution, in Mid-day Meal Scheme and in ICDS Scheme. In addition, pulses from the buffer are being utilized to meet the requirement of Army and Central Para-Military Forces. The balance stock is disposed in market, based on considerations like shelf life, efficient buffer management, market prices etc. 3. Creation of buf fer stock of pulses has helped in moderating pulses prices. Lower prices of pulses lead to consumer savings. Built buffer also led to remunerative prices to farmers as procurement for buffer was undertaken at MSP or higher rates from them. This incentivized production which led to two successive years of bumper production taking country towards self-sufficiency and resulting in reduced imports and concomitant savings in forex. 4. Subsequently, Government has decided that procurement at MSP would be under Price Support Scheme of Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare and requirement towards building suitable buffer would be met from the PSS stock in case procurement is not required to be undertaken under PSF. As the procurement since Rabi-17 was under MSP operation of PSS, pulses procured under Price Support Scheme (PSS) of Department of Agriculture and Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DACFW) have since been channelized to PSF to the extent of meeting buffer requirements. Since April 2019, around 20.07 LMT has been transferred from PSS to PSF to replenish buffer under PSF. Further, based on request from States and endorsement of the same by DACFW, 1.8 LMT Tur was procured under PSF at MSP during KMS 2019-20. Also, around 93 MT Masur was procured at market prices during RMS 2020 under PSF.190 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 5. States/UTs are also being encouraged to set up their own State level PSF. Till date, financial assistance has been provided to Odisha, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Assam. 6. Government of India has entered into a MoU with Mozambique to ensure assured supply of pulses (Tur and other pulses) in India. The MoU envisages imports of 2 LMT pulses during 2020-21. 7. Pulses from the PSF buffer are also being utiliz ed for free supplies under PMGKAY and ANB package. This has helped in ensuring food security during the challenging times of COVID-19. 8. Government of India maintains buffer stocks of onion under PSF for making appropriate price stabilizing market interventions. Onion from buffer stock is released in a calibrated manner through retail intervention to retail agencies/State/UTs and open market sale during lean season/period to contain prices and availability. Buffer stock of about 1 LMT created from Rabi 2020 onion is released in a calibrated manner to moderate prices of onion since September 2020. The Government also conveyed approval for procurement of 1 LMT onion Kharif 2020-21. Analysis on onion price seasonality and effective policy measures is discussed in Box 4. Box 4: Onion prices and buffer stock policy Over the years, it has been observed that in the period August-November prices of onion sky- rocket. This happens despite the government efforts to create a buffer stock to sell the onion when retail prices increase, exposing the absence of a suitable policy to ensure price stability of India's staple vegetable. Retail prices of onion (2015-2020) Source: PMC, DCA191 Prices and Inflation Why Price Spikes in August to November? Rabi harvesting takes place between March and May in most states and the crop is sold during June-July period, kharif harvesting takes place between October and November and the crop is available in the market till rabi harvest. The period between the two that is August to November is when we observe the prices of onion rise sharply. Recent policy measures by government: Government has ensured that various pro-active measures are taken to curtail onion price rise. On 23.10.2020, stock limit on the onions was imposed under the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 (25 MT for Wholesalers and 2 MT for Retailers) for a period up to 31.12.2020. In order to moderate the price rise, the government took a pre-emptive step by announcing a ban on onion export on 14.09.2020 so as to ensure availability to domestic consumers at reasonable rates, before the expected arrival of Kharif onion. The government also stepped-up disposal of onion through the built-up onion buffer stock from the Rabi onion 2020 of 1 LMT which was doubled since the quantity of last year. Further, Onions are also being disposed off through Open Market Sales. The government has also facilitated the import by the private traders, it has also been decided that MMTC would import red onions to meet the demand supply gap. Effectiveness of government measures In 2019, NAFED created buffer stock of approx. 58288 tonnes, out of which around 18808 tonnes of onions were damaged, 33313 tonnes were distributed in the local market due to being of sub-standard quality and only 6167 tonnes could be distributed to states. This time, NAFED has created around 99000 tonnes, out of which 25,000 tonnes are likely to be damaged, however, stocks actually distributed to states are still low at 11653 tonnes (till November 2020). Onion stock position Source: NAFED * dispatch to state government and local market under process192 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Distribution of onion stock Source: NAFED * dispatch to state government and local market under process NAFED stores its buffer stock of onion using traditional methods, as opposed to cold storage, leading to the wastage. As per the data, every year almost 100 per cent of the stock procured is stored in traditional and conventionally designed storage facilities, in 2020, approximately 15 per cent of the stocks are stored in modern and equipped storage facilities as popularised by National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF). The wastages are further aggravated due to the adverse weather conditions like untimely rainfall and excess moisture. Moreover, NAFED procures and stores onion mostly in three states- Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. This concentration of stock storage in just three states makes it more susceptible to adverse weather shocks. Moreover, this doesn't allow for immediate action when needed, in fact delays it. A decentralised system of procurement and storage with proper tracking can make the system more robust. Suggestions 1. NAFED approached state governments to send their requirements of lean months in advance to ensure timely evacuation of the stored onion in a planned manner to have a salutary effect on retail prices, which tend to go up in the period late August to November. However, this process could be made more transparent and done further well in advance to ensure timely distribution. 2. There should be a transparent online platform where all information relating to requirement details by states, procurement undertaken state wise and month wise, amount disbursed state wise, agency wise, month wise should be made available for better planning and decision making.193 Prices and Inflation 3. In Maharashtra, Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Western Uttar Pradesh large- scale storage of onions is taken in conventionally-designed structures. In other states, the storage is taken only on small scale but now showing increasing trend after the post-harvest technology and improved storage structures have been popularized by NHRDF. Traditional storage practices result in substantial losses in stored onions, hence use of improved storage structures as well as use of good storer varieties, judicious use of fertilizers, timely irrigation and post-harvest technology are essential to reduce the losses in stored onions (Operation Greens portal). 4. Develop an eVIN like tracking system: eVIN (electronic vaccine intelligence network) aims to strengthen the evidence base for improved policy-making in vaccine delivery, procurement and planning for new antigens in India. For onion supply we do not need such a complicated system but a simple tracking system based on the principles of eVIN might be adequate. This can help provide real-time information on onion stocks, track storage temperature and moisture level and alert the authorities whenever any parameter is breached. 5. Use of dehydrated onions that has longer shelf life should be promoted for buffer stock purpose. Hydrated variety should be sold early . CONCLUSION 5.36 During 2020-21, retail and wholesale inflation saw movements in the opposite directions. While headline CPI-C inflation saw an increase compared to the previous year, WPI inflation remained benign. Supply-side shocks especially owing to COVID-19 pandemic affected the retail inflation with food articles contributing to the overall rise in inflation. The easing of supply side restrictions, which saw inflation moderate in December 2020 are expected to continue this easing. Government interventions to augment the supply of commodities as well as to ensure the provision of essentials have likely softened the impact of the pandemic. Food inflation has already eased in December reducing overall inflationary pressures. Going forward, as food inflation eases further, overall inflation is expected to moderate further. On the other hand, improving demand conditions are likely to keep WPI inflation in the positive territory with improving pricing power for manufacturers. CHAPTER AT A GLANCE Headline CPI inflation averaged 6.6 per cent in 2020-21 (Apr-Dec) and stood at 4.6 per cent in December 2020, mainly driven by rise in food inflation, which has increased from 6.7 per cent in 2019-20 to 9.1 per cent in 2020-21 (Apr-Dec), owing to build up in vegetable prices. At the global level, inflation remained benign on the back of subdued economic activity as a result of COVID-19 outbreak and sharp fall in international crude oil prices in advanced economies.194 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 The rural-urban difference in CPI inflation, which was high in 2019, saw a decline in 2020. Since November 2019, CPI-Urban inflation has closed the gap with CPI-Rural inflation. Food inflation has almost converged now, however, divergence in rural-urban inflation is observed in other components of CPI like fuel and light, clothing and footwear, miscellaneous etc. CPI headline and most of its sub groups inflation from April-October 2020 was mostly driven by substantial increase in price momentum, possibly due to the initial disruptions caused by COVID-19 lockdown. By November 2020, price momentum has moderated significantly for most sub groups and coupled with positive base effect helped ease inflation. During 2019-20 (Apr-Dec) as well as 2020-21 (Apr-Dec), the major driver of CPI-C inflation was the food and beverages group. Its contribution has increased to 59 per cent in 2020-21 (Apr-Dec) compared to 53.7 per cent in 2019-20 (Apr-Dec). Thali cost have increased between June 2020 and November 2020, they witnessed a sharp fall in the month of December reflecting the fall in the prices of many essential food commodities. State wise trend shows that CPI-C inflation increased in most of the states in the current year. However, regional variation persists. Inflation ranged between 3.2 per cent to 11 per cent across States/UTs in 2020-21 (Jun-Dec) compared to (-) 0.3 per cent to 7.6 per cent in the same period last year. Food inflation has been driving overall CPI-C inflation due to the relatively more weight of food items in the index. While food habits have undergone revisions over the decade since 2011-12 (base year of CPI), the base year of CPI needs revision. Further, in the context of increasing e-commerce transactions, it is important to include such new sources of price data for the construction price indices. Steps were taken to stabilise prices of food items like banning of export of onions, imposition of stock limit on onions, easing of restriction on imports of pulses etc. Apart from the short-term measures to curtail the upward price movement, we need to invest in medium to long-term measures such as decentralised cold storage facilities at production centres. Good storer varieties, judicious use of fertilizers, timely irrigation and post-harvest technology are essential to reduce the losses in stored onions (Operation Greens portal). Review of onion buffer stock policy is also essential. System needs to be developed to reduce wastages, efficient management and ensure timely release. Consistency in import policy also warrants attention. Increased dependence on imports of edible oils poses risk of fluctuations in import prices and imports impacting production and prices of domestic edible oil market, coupled with frequent changes in import policy of pulses and edible oils adds to confusion among farmers/producers and delay in imports. Gold prices saw sharp spike as investors turned to gold as a safe haven investment amid COVID-19 induced economic uncertainties. Compared to other assets, gold had returns during the year that were considerably higher.195 Prices and Inflation REFERENCES CACP. 2020. \"Price Policy for Kharif Crops: The Marketing Season 2020-21.

Presently seven commodities are included in the Schedule of the EC Act viz., (1) Drugs; (2) Fertilizer, whether inorganic, organic or mixed; (3) foodstuffs, including edible oilseeds and oils; (4) hank yarn made wholly from cotton; (5) petroleum and petroleum products; (6) raw jute and jute textiles; (7) (i) seeds of food-crops and seeds of fruits and vegetables; (ii) seed of cattle fodder; (iii) jute seed; (iv) cotton seed. The Essential Commodities Act, 1955 empowers the Government to regulate essential commodities through regulation, by licences, permits, control of prices at which bought or sold, prohibiting/ withholding from sale collection of any information/ statistics, inspection of books and accounts etc. for maintaining or increasing their supplies and for securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices. Controls order dated 29.09.2016 has removed licensing requirements, stock limits and movement restrictions on identified foodstuffs unless expressly provided for. Under enabling orders a State may impose licensing, permits and other control measures. In respect of 'Foodstuffs' most of the powers of Central Government under the Act, have been delegated to the State Governments vide order dated 09.06.1978 and for 'other than foodstuffs' vide order dated 30.11.1974 with the direction that they shall exercise these powers. Exercising powers under the Act, various Ministries/Departments of the Central Government and State Governments/UT Administrations have issued Control Orders for regulating production, distribution, pricing etc. and trading of the commodities declared as essential. Amendments to the EC Act Recently, Government of India has amended the Essential Commodities Act of 1955 and inserted a new sub-section (1A) in Section 3 of the Essential Commodities (EC) Act, 1955. Section 3(IA) (a) now provides that foodstuffs, including cereals, pulses, potato, onions, edible oil seeds and oils shall only be regulated under extra ordinary circumstances which may include war, famine, extra ordinary price rise and natural calamity of grave nature. Section 3(IA)(b) provides that any action on imposing stock limit would be based on price trigger such as hundred per cent increase in retail price of horticultural produce and fifty percent increase in retail price of non-perishable agricultural foodstuff over the immediately preceding twelve months or average retail price of last five years whichever is lower; there is suitable exemption for exporters, processors and value chain participants of any agricultural produce as well as the Public Distribution System. The Amendment includes a definition of value chain participants covering all the entities who add value to each stage from production to consumption. It is a visionary step, one which would radically alter the incomes and growth prospects of farmers and incentivize investment in the entire agri-sector.197 Prices and Inflation Necessity of Amendment The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 was the culmination of a series of consultations and deliberations by the High Powered Committee for Transformation of Indian Agriculture comprising the Department of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare, NITI Aayog, and the Chief Ministers of the of Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Arunachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. The Committee had deliberated on several issues pertaining to the sector and made key recommendations, including, inter alia, the amendment of the Essential Commodities Act in order to boost investment in the sector, particularly for enhancing storage capacity for agricultural produce. As the country was reeling under the adverse effects of COVID-19 pandemic, and the resilient agriculture sector showed its potential of making a significant contribution to economic activity, the need of the hour was to undertake reforms for boosting investment and growth. It was imperative that an enabling environment based on ease of doing business be created, and removing the fear of frequent statutory controls under the EC Act, was one such reform measure that had already been recommended by the afore-mentioned High-Powered Committee. Amendments balance the interest of all the stakeholders: Amendments to the EC Act balance the interest of all the stakeholders including farmers, exporters, processors, other value chain participants and consumers by removing the fear of \"excessive regulatory interference\". At the same time, power has been retained with the Government for regulation under certain extraordinary circumstances. The Amendment not only takes exporters, processors and other value chain participants out of the ambit of the stock limits under the EC Act but also puts in place a well-defined mechanism for imposition of these limits. Now price triggers have been well defined - an increase of 100 per cent for perishable and 50 per cent for non-perishable foodstuffs. Provide farmers greater choice in selling their produce: Amendments to the EC Act along with the other Ordinances allowing sale and purchase of farm produce outside notified market yards, facilitating contract farming and allowing farmers to engage in direct marketing, would greatly benefit the farmers and help them realise better price for their produce. Now physical market participants can directly buy from the farmers without the fear of excessive regulation and stock limits under the EC Act. This would improve the bargaining power of farmers. Attract private investment: \"Excessive regulatory interference\" under the EC Act was coming in the way of investment in the agriculture sector particularly in post-harvesting activities. Private sector was hesitant in investing in cold chains and storage facilities for perishable items as most of these commodities were under the ambit of the EC Act and stock limits were attracted suddenly. Now any limits under EC Act shall not be applicable to exporters, processors and other value chain participants. This would now attract private investment which would help farmers in better storage and prices. Promote value chain participants which would minimize farm wastages: The Annual Report of MoFPI (2018-19) quotes a study by Central Institute of Post-Harvest Engineering & Technology (CIPHET) which estimates the annual value of harvest and post-harvest losses of major agricultural commodities at Rs.92,651 crore using the production data of 2012-13 at 2014 wholesale prices. Most of the wastage is occurring in the case of fruits and vegetables. Farmers 198 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 suffer huge losses when there are bumper harvests of perishable commodities. With adequate processing facilities, much of this wastage can be reduced thus providing remunerative prices to producers as well as ensuring greater supply to consumers. Amendment to EC Act would provide a much needed fillip to the value chain participants as their fears of sudden regulation of stock limit in these commodities would be adequately addressed. Help in price stabilization: What is needed today is the entry of market players who can contribute to price stability for farmers through their investments. Exempting agri-food commodities from restrictive provisions of EC Act will attract organised sector to agriculture trade, much needed for price stabilization, investments in cold storages and logistics, and modernization of the food supply chain. This will also remove inherent fears of investors about excessive regulatory interference emanating out of EC Act. The freedom to produce, hold, move, distribute and supply will lead to harnessing of economies of scale and attract private sector/foreign direct investment into agriculture sector. Safeguarding Consumers: The Government, while liberalizing the regulatory environment in order to boost farmers' income and attract investment to the agriculture sector, has also ensured that interests of consumers are safeguarded. It has been provided in the Amendment, that in situations such as war, famine, extraordinary price rise and natural calamity, such agricultural foodstuff can be regulated. Whenever there is unprecedented price rise, provision has been made for independent and objective assessment that this price rise needs to be dealt with through imposition of stock limits. The price of that commodity during the preceding year will be compared with the average prices over the preceding five years; the lower of the two figures will be the base figure and if prevailing price of that commodity is 100 per cent higher (for perishable commodity), or 50 per cent higher (for non-perishable commodity), this will be the trigger for imposing stock limits. However, the installed capacity of a value chain participant and the export demand of an exporter will remain exempted from such stock limit imposition. From the perspective of protecting consumers, Government now has many other tools such as buffers of various essential food items (cereals, pulses and onions) and appropriate trade policy instruments such as export restriction and import liberalizations, there is planned intervention of Government for managing prices. Circumstances when stock limits may be imposed The amendment provides for objective criteria for taking any decision on the imposition of stock limits on such agri food stuff. The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 provides the circumstances under which the supply of agricultural food stuffs including cereals, pulses, potato, onion, edible oilseeds and oils shall be regulated, and they are as follows: war, famine, extraordinary price rise and natural calamity of grave nature. The condition for imposition and regulation of stock limit of agricultural produce is \"100% increase in the retail price of horticultural produce; or 50% increase in the retail price of nonperishable agricultural foodstuff over the price prevailing immediately preceding one year or average retail price of last 5 years whichever is lower.\" Based on the objective criteria of the price of onion as on Oct 21, 2020 of Rs.55.6 per kg, in comparison with the price on Oct 21, 2019 of Rs.45.53 per kg and the average retail prices of the last five years of Rs.25.86 per kg, the decision to regulate the sale of onion by imposing stock limits to check hoarding, was taken. A notification to this effect was issued on Oct 23, 2020. The stock limits are fixed as 25 MT for wholesalers and 2 MT for retailers.199 Prices and Inflation Power of State Government after amendment The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 has not curbed the powers of the State Governments to enforce stock limits on essential commodities or take actions on hoarders and profiteers. The state would still exercise all its powers including issuance of permits, licences, etc. for regulating the production, distribution, supply, movement, transportation, etc. of the essential commodities. This is amply clear from the advisory issued on Oct 29, 2020 to all states suggesting that three days' time after purchase of onion from Mandis be allowed for packing, grading etc., before any action is taken in pursuance to the order imposing stock limits.200 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 APPENDIX-2 CHRONOLOG y OF THE INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES (AMENDMENT ) ACT, 2020 S.

Several initiatives have been taken at both the national and the sub national level to mainstream the SDGs into the policies, schemes and programmes of the Government. India has been taking several proactive climate actions to fulfill its obligations as per the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and equity. As mandated in the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement, the climate actions of the developing countries would have to be supported by finance flows from the developed to the developing countries. The Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) submitted by the country has been formulated keeping in mind the developmental imperatives of the country and is on a \"best effort basis\". In its NDC, India has sought to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 per cent below 2005 levels by the year 2030; achieve 40 per cent of cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030; and enhance forest and tree cover to create additional carbon sink equivalent to 2.5 to 3 billion tons of carbon dioxide by 2030. We need to strive for equity across nations and within a nation, and equity across and within the generations. The COVID-19 pandemic and the iniquitous impact of the consequent lockdown reemphasizes the fact that sustainable development is the only way forward. INTRODUCTION 6.1 As the official adoption of SDGs reached its 4th anniversary, World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), on 30th January 2020. The resultant public health emergency , which was later pronounced to be a pandemic, has led to considerable human and economic costs setting countries back on their developmental goals and creating serious impediments to the attainment of the SDGs. 6.2 The year 2020 was supposed to be the year by which developed country Parties were to fulfill the goal of jointly mobilizing US$ 100 billion a year for climate finance, an essential component of the commitments made by the developed countries, which has remained elusive. The postponement of COP 26 to 2021 also gives less time for negotiations and other evidence- based work to inform the post-2025 goal. 205 Sustainable Development and Climate Change 6.3 India is no exception to the unprecedented crisis unleashed by the pandemic. It is faced with remarkable challenges emerging from the need to provide substantive economic stimulus, address livelihood losses, introduce and implement wide ranging economic reforms. The need to develop sustainably , however , remains at the core of the country' s development strategy . INDIA AND THE SDGs 6.4 India has taken several proactive steps at both the national and the sub national level to mainstream the SDGs into the policies, schemes and programmes of the Government. In 2020, the highlight of India's SDG initiatives has been the Voluntary National Review (VNR) presented to the United Nations High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) on Sustainable Development which is the highest international platform for review and follow-up of the SDGs under the auspices of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. The reviews are voluntary and country -led and are aimed at facilitating the sharing of experiences, including successes, challenges and lessons learned. NITI Aayog presented India's second VNR to the HLPF in July 2020, which highlighted the country's accomplishments and the way forward on its journey towards achieving the SDGs. In addition to the progress achieved in various sectors, the VNR Report also presented the Indian model of SDG localisation, perspectives from various stakeholder consultations, strategies of integrating businesses with the implementation of SDGs, and ways to strengthen the means of implementation. 6.5 Consultations with over 1000 Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) have been the cornerstone of the VNR Report preparation process. The consultations involved fourteen specific groups (Figure 1). The focus of the consultations was the principle of \"Leaving No One Behind\", which lies at the heart of SDGs. Figure 1: Stakeholder Consultations Process Source: NITI Aayog 6.6 These stakeholder consultations provided a platform for engagement and feedback on India's progress towards the SDGs. This platform was widely acknowledged among the participants as a conduit for institutionalised dialogue. For state and market action to keep up 206 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 1 with the myriad manifestations of these challenges, the nature of engagement will have to be adaptive, iterative and based on feedback, which institutionalised dialogue can provide. 6.7 The preparation of the VNR also provided an excellent opportunity to strengthen the engagement with the private sector on SDGs. In the recent past, private sector spending under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives has been a major avenue for private sector involvement in the SDG framework. The VNR process enhanced the uptake in adoption of business responsibility and sustainability frameworks and created greater consciousness among industry leaders for the same. This is echoed in the 'Report of the Committee on Business Responsibility Reporting' which was released in 2020. Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) frameworks outlined in this report emanate from the National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC) which are aligned to the SDGs, and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business & Human Rights (UNGPs). BRSR formats incorporate the growing salience of non-financial disclosures along with the annual financial disclosures ensuring the recognition of environmental and social responsibilities. Localization of the SDGs 6.8 Localisation of SDGs is crucial to any strategy aimed at achieving the goals under the 2030 Agenda. Essentially, localising SDGs involves the process of adapting, planning, implementing and monitoring the SDGs from national to local levels by relevant institutions and stakeholders. In terms of engagement and collaboration of institutions, it is consequential how the Centre, State and Local Governments work together to achieve the SDGs at the national level; and how SDGs provide a framework for subnational and local policy, planning and action for realisation of the SDG targets at local levels. To accelerate SDG achievements, the country has adopted the approach of cooperative and competitive federalism which is based on Centre-State collaboration in nation building and healthy competition among the States in various development outcomes. The SDG India Index and Dashboard, designed and developed by NITI Aayog, is the principal tool to measure and monitor SDG performance at the national and sub-national levels. The states are institutionally empowered and positioned to achieve the SDGs with the support of the Central Government and allied institutions. Hence, the States are the key actors in the process of localisation of SDGs with the Central Government playing an enabling role. Figure 2: SDG Localisation A.

Several states have also created nodal mechanisms within every department and at the district levels to make coordination, convergence and data management more precise and predictable. Figure 2(A and B) shows the institutional set up for SDG localisation. SDG related intervention of the Centre Governments during the pandemic 6.10 The COVID-19 pandemic has, further, underscored the need to keep sustainable development at the very core of any development strategy. The pandemic has challenged the health infrastructure, adversely impacted livelihoods and exacerbated the inequality in the food and nutritional availability in the country. This has reemphasized the criticality of having institutions and mechanisms that can facilitate the country to absorb exogenous shocks well. The period of the pandemic has seen coordinated efforts of both the Centre and the State Governments in preserving and creating livelihoods, ensuring that food and nutritional requirements are met and that the health facilities are augmented to cope with the pressure cr eated by th e co ntagion. Initiatives addressed the immediate impact of COVID-19 pandemic and enabled the country to progress on its SDGs even in these very difficult times. In addition several reforms measures have been brought in such as in agricultural labour and MSME reforms which will directly or indirectly impact the SDGs. The State Governments also responded with several measures to support those affected by the pandemic through various initiatives and reliefs to fight this pandemic. CLIMATE CHANGE 6.11 India has been taking several proactive climate actions to fulfil its obligations as per the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and equity. The Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) submitted by the country has been formulated keeping in mind the developmental imperatives of the country and is on a \"best effort basis\". In its NDC, India has sought to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 per cent 208 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 1 below 2005 levels by the ye ar 2030; achieve 40 per cent of cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030; and enhance forest and tree cover to create additional carbon sink equivalent to 2.5 to 3 billion tons of carbon dioxide by 2030. The other go als pertain to adoption of sustainable lifestyles based on traditional values of conservation and moderation, adaptation to climate change, clean economic development and environment- friendly technology , etc. Prominent Government initiatives on mitigation & adaptation actions and their progress 6.12 India's National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) was launched in 2008. It has through 8 National Missions focussed on advancing the country's climate change related objectives of adaptation, mitigation and preparedness on climate risks. The Government has decided to revise the NAPCC in li ne with the NDC submitted by India under the Paris Agreement to ma ke it more comprehensive in terms of the priority areas. The major developments under the NAPCC are captured in Table 1 below . Table 1: National Missions under NAPCC Missions Major objective/Target Progress 1. National Solar Mission (NSM)Achieve 100 GW of solar power in seven years starting from 2014-15.The cumulative capacity of 36.9 GW was commissioned till November 2020.

It takes a holistic view on greening and focuses on multiple ecosystem services along with carbon sequestration and emission reduction as co-benefits. The mission was started with the objective to increase forest/tree cover on 5 million hectares (m ha) of forest/non-forest land and improve quality of forest cover on another 5 m ha land area. The mission also targeted improvement of ecosystem services including biodiversity, hydrological services and carbon sequestration. The mission's interventions were started in the year 2015-16 with the collaborative effort of Central and State Governments. The various afforestation activities including tree plantation were taken up over 8.49 m ha area from 2015-16 to 2019-20 under the various schemes of the Central Government inclusive of 1.42 lakh ha under this mission, state plan schemes and also plantation taken up by the NGOs, civil societies and corporate houses as reported under the Twenty Point Program. Figure 5 below depicts the afforestation target and its achievement. Figure 5: The afforestation target and its achievement under various schemes including Green India Mission. Source: Directorate of Green India Mission 6.16 Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP) a Central Sector Scheme, was approved in January 2014 to build and support the scientific and analytical capacity for assessment of climate change in the country, establish appropriate institutional framework and implement climate actions at a total cost of ` 290 crores for a duration of fiv e years. Two important components of the CCAP scheme are the National Carbonaceous Aerosols Program (NCAP) and the Long-Term Ecological Observatories (LTEO). NC AP is a multi-institutional program being implemented by a consortium of 17 institutions led by IIT Bo mbay. It was inaugurated in the year 2017-18 and is a fiv e-year duration project. LTEO is another project under the CC AP scheme for duration of 5 years and was started in the year 2019-2020. The duration of CCAP was initially from 2017-18 to 2019-20 and this was later on extended till 2020-21 with a budget outlay of ` 218.43 crore. 6.17 In addition to the above, National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change (NAFCC) a Central Sector Scheme with National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) as the National Implementing Entity was operationalized in 2015-16, with a budget allocation of ` 350 214 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 1 crores for the 12th Five Year Plan. This scheme has continued beyond the 12th Five Year Plan till 31st March 2020 with a financial implication of ` 364 crores. The aim of NAPCC is to support concrete adaptation activities which are not covered under on-going activities through the schemes of State/UT and National Governments. Till September 2020, 30 projects (including two multi state regional projects) worth ` 847.5 crores have been approved by NAFCC. These projects are at different stages of implementation in 27 states in agriculture, water, forestry, urban, coastal sectors, marine system, etc. 6.18 The Government is implementing Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid&) Electric Vehicle in India (FAME India) scheme1 w.e.f 1st April, 2015 to encourage progressive induction of reliable, affordable and efficient electric and hybrid vehicles. The Phase-I of the Scheme was extended from time to time and the last extension was allowed till 31st March, 2019. Based on outcome and experience gained during the Phase-I of FAME India Scheme and after having consultations with all stakeholders including industry and industry associa- tions, the Government notified Phase-II of FAME India Scheme on 8th March, 2019, which is for a period of three years commencing from 1st April, 2019 with a total budgetary support of `10,000 crore. This phase aims to generate demand by way of supporting 7000 electric buses (e-bus), 5 lakh electric three wheelers (e-3W), 55000 electric four wheeler passenger cars (in- cluding (e-4W)and 10 lakh electric two wheelers (e-2W). India's NDC and its forthcoming challenges 6.19 India has recognized that its path of development must be one which places adequate emphasis on all the three pillars of sustainable development, namely, economic, social and environmental. A great deal of stress is also being laid upon the inter-generational equity in regard to the emerging climate actions proposed to be taken by the present generation. However, the imperatives of the intra-generational equity, i.e., eradication of poverty and equitable social and economic development cannot be brushed aside. The implementation of the climate targets is intertwined with global and national economic scenario. 6.20 The national circumstances demand that the first priority for India be adaptation, being a country highly vulnerable to extreme weather events. Climate change impacts are expected to worsen with the passage of time because of the momentum due to carbon stock continuing to increase the temperature. Hence, India's adaptation efforts will have to be further intensified and with that the adaptation costs will increase. The country is relying on domestic resources to implement adaptation and mitigation action on mission mode. The financing considerations will therefore remain critical especially as the country steps up the targets substantially. With the COVID-19 pandemic, the primary focus of the country is on ensuring protection of lives and livelihoods. Even so climate action remains a priority . 6.21 The implementation of NDC effectively commences on 01.01.2021. India's NDC clearly states that finance is a critical enabler of climate change action. The preliminary financial estimates in NDC document indicates that India would need around US$ 206 billion 1 https://fame2.heavyindustry.gov.in/ 215 Sustainable Development and Climate Change (at 2014-15 prices) between 2015 and 2030 for implementing adaptation actions in key areas like agriculture, forestry, fisheries, infrastructure, water resources and ecosystems. Apart from this, additional investments will be needed for strengthening resilience and disaster management. Preliminary estimates provided by NDC indicates that India's climate change actions till 2030 will require financial resource of US$ 2.5 trillion (at 2014-15 prices). It is important to have a clearer assessment of the financial requirement for implementing India's NDC so that allocation of resources may be appropriate and efficient considering India's commitments and the fact that resources have competing uses. Hence, a careful estimation of the cost requirements for implementing the NDC and the possible sources for meeting these requirements is an essential pre-requisite. 6.22 A vailability of adequate financial resources required to implement wide-ranging NDC goals presents a major challenge. India has proactively pursued actions on climate change and achieved a reduction in emission intensity of GDP by 21 per cent over the period 2005-2014 as per India's second Biennial Update Report (BUR). However, to fully implement our NDC in a timely manner, the country requires enhanced new and additional financial resources, technological support and capacity building. New and additional financial resources and technological support to the developing countries was committed to by the developed countries under the Paris Agreement and this needs to be implemented. 6.23 An integrated approach is required at the domestic and international front to get the necessary resources essential for apposite climate action. Further, it is important to note that the developed countries need to do much more than what they are currently committed to, achieve climate action at an appropriate level. The present scope, scale and speed of international climate finance is, however, insufficient as the climate finance requirements run into trillions of dollars as against a commitment of US$ 100 billion each year by 2020 by the developed countries, a very modest obligation but which has yet to be realized. MULTILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS ON CLIMATE CHANGE 6.24 Since the Ri o Conference and the adoption of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992, the multilateral regime on climate change has evolved and adopted a nu mber of agreements and decisions to strengthen th e global response to address the problem of climate change. The latest treaty - the Paris Agreement was adopted under UNFCCC in December 2015 to enhance the implementation of the Convention. Its central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the global temperature rise this century to well below 2 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to li mit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees celsius through enhanced support from developed countries to the developing countries. A brief history of the agreements and decisions adopted from Rio Earth Summit in 1992 is brought out in Figure 6.216 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 1 Figure 6: Rio Summit 1992 to the 24th Session of the Conference of Parties (COP 24)- A brief history of the decisions taken Adoption of UNFCCC: Developed country Parties should lead in combating climate change; equity and CBDR -RC More responsibilities on the developed nations under \"common but differentiated responsibilities.\" Kyoto Protocol : 1997 (Entered into force: 16 Feb. 2005) First quantification of climate finance; flow of US$ 100 billion per year by 2020 by the developed countries to the developing nations COP -15: 2009 Commitment to mobilize scaled -up funds to enable developing countries to take greater action.

It requires all Parties to put forward their best efforts through NDCs and to strengthen these efforts in the years ahead. The Agreement also provides for enhanced transparency of action and support through a transparency framework. Finance mechanism was agreed under Article 9 COP -21: 2015 New rules of accounting and a framework for climate finance was agreed upon under the Paris Agreement Work Programme COP -24: 201 8 Source: Various COP Decisions.GCF - Green Climate Fund 25th Session of the Conference of Parties (COP 25) 6.25 The COP 25 decision text, titled 'Chile Madrid Ti me for Action', emphasized the continued challenges that the developing countries face in accessing financial, technology and capacity- building support. It recognized the urgent need to enhance the provision of support to the developing country Parties to enable them to strengthen their national adaptation and mitigation efforts. The decision al so recalled the commitment ma de by the developed country Parties to the goal of mobilizing jointly US$ 100 billion per ye ar by 2020 to address the needs of the developing country Parties. On the is sue of global ambition for combating climate change, the decision adopted provided for a balanced and integrated view that includes not only efforts for climate change mitigation, but also for adaptation and 'means of implementation' support from the developed country Parties to the developing country Parties. 26th Session of the Conference of Parties (COP 26) and Post 2020 Issues 6.26 Due to COVID-19 pandemic, the COP 26 and the preceding UNFCCC subsidiary bodies' sessions has now been postponed to 2021. COP 26 is expected to take forward the discussions and reach consensus on the transparency mechanism; Article 6 (market and non-217 Sustainable Development and Climate Change market mechanisms); common time frames for nationally determined contributions; long- term climate finance etc. The other important issues for COP 26 include governance of Warsaw International Mechanism for loss and damage, continued work on pre-2020 implementation and launch of second periodic review of the long-term global goal under the Convention and of overall progress towards achieving it. On finance matters, it is essential to arrive at a consensus on the definition of climate finance and on a common accounting methodology for assessment and evaluation of climate finance. This is also critical for initiating the process required for establishing the new collective goals on climate finance, post 2020, based on the requirements of the developing country parties. ALIGNING FINANCE WITH SUSTAINABILITY Augmenting Finance for Sustainable Development 6.27 There is a coherent move to augment financing for sustainable development. Consistent with the aspirational vision for the financial sector in India, the Government's development priorities and the need to support the well-being of the people, several measures have already been taken in the past few years and further steps are being taken. These include the following: (i) National Voluntary Guidelines for Responsible Financing2 was finalized in 2015. These are financial sector-specific guidelines that combine and adapt international and national best practices. The guidelines are a voluntary instrument and raise the bar of conduct for financial institutions beyond compliance. These guidelines lay down 8 principles, which cover different aspects of environmental, social and governance (ESG) responsibilities to inform business action. (ii) In 2015, the RBI included lending to social infrastructure and small renewable energy projects within the priority sector targets3. In September 2020, the loan limits for renewable energy were doubled to ` 30 crores and for individual households, the renewable ener gy loan limit is ` 10 lakhs per borrower.4 (iii) The 'Voluntary Guidelines on Corporate Social Responsibility'5 were issued in 2009 to mainstream the concept of business responsibility. The guidelines were developed based on India's socio-cultural context and priorities as well as global best practices including United Nations Guiding Principles on Business & Human Rights, Paris Agreement on Climate change etc. The revised guidelines were relea sed as the National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct6 in March 2019. The NGRBC has been designed to assist businesses to embrace the principle of responsible conduct. (iv) In order to reflect the NGRBC principles in the Business Responsibility Reporting (BRR) framework, a Committee was constituted to review and update the BRR 2 https://www.cafral.org.in/sfControl/content/LearningTakeaWays/1213201764617PMNationalVoluntaryGuidelinesfor Responsible Financing.pdf 3 https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=10497&Mode=0 4 6 https://www.mca.gov.in/Ministry/pdf/NationalGuildeline_15032019.pdf218 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 1 formats for listed as well as unlisted companies. In its Report7 submitted in May 2020, the Committee recommended a new reporting framework called the 'Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR)' to better reflect the intent and scope of reporting on non-financial parameters by both listed as well as unlisted companies above specified thresholds of turnover and/or paid-up capital. The Committee envisions that the information captured through BRSR filings be used to develop a Business Responsibility-Sustainability Index for companies. (v) The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) through its 'Listing Regulations' in 2012 mandated the top 100 listed entities by market capitalization to disclose their performance against the NVGs using a Business Responsible Report (BRR) format8 from an environmental, social and governance perspective. This was extended to top 500 listed entities in 2015-16. In December 2019, SEBI extended the BRR requirement to top 1000 listed companies by market capitalization from 2019-209. SEBI had also issued a circular in 2017, which stated that Integrated Reporting10 may be adopted on a voluntary basis from the financial year 2017-18 by the top 500 listed entities which are required to prepare BRR. (vi) Going beyond the innovative sustainability-themed capital market products such as Green Bonds or Social Impact Bonds, India is moving in the direction of creating a Social Stock Exchange (SSE), under the regulatory ambit of SEBI for raising capital by Social Enterprises working for the realization of a social welfare objective. SEBI constituted a Working Group (WG) on Social Stock Exchanges in September 201911. The Working Group submitted the Report12 on 1st June 2020. The Working Group has outlined its vision and made recommendations, which include participation of Non-profit organizations (NPOs) and For-profit enterprises (FPEs) on SSE subject to committing to minimum reporting requirements. Additionally, the WG has also recommended standardization of financial reporting by NPOs on SSE. In terms of the recommendations of the WG, there is a need to develop a framework for on-boarding NPOs and FPEs on the SSE prescribe disclosure requirements relating to financials, governance, performance etc. and dwell upon aspects related to social impact, social audit, and information repositories etc. In September 2020, SEBI has constituted a technical gr oup to develop and make recommendations on these aspects13. 7 http://www.mca.gov.in/Ministry/pdf/BRR_11082020.pdf 8 https://www.sebi.gov.in/sebi_data/attachdocs/1344915990072.pdf 13 https://www.sebi.gov.in/media/press-releases/sep-2020/sebi-constitutes-technical-group-on-social-stock-exchange_47607. html219 Sustainable Development and Climate Change (vii) Green bonds are debt instrument issued by an entity for raising funds from investors and the proceeds of a green bond offering are used towards financing 'green' projects. Green bonds are an effective vehicle to raise capital for renewable energy projects while meeting the environmental targets of the investors and climate targets of the Government of India. In 2017, to give push to Green Bonds issuances in India, SEBI issued guidelines14 on green bonds including listing of green bonds on the Indian stock exchanges. The launch of green indices such as S&P BSE CARBONEX (in 2012), MSCI ESG India (in 2013), and S&P BSE 100 ESG Index (in 2017) allows passive and retail investors to invest in 'green' companies. As of 24th December, 2020, eight ESG mutual funds have been launched in India. 6.28 The cumulative issuance of global green bonds crossed US$ 1 trillion mark in 2020. Despite overall growth in the global bond markets, green bond issuance in the first half of 2020 slowed down from 2019. Green bond volumes were the most negatively impacted of all themes, but there were positive signs in the market that point to increasing demand and better performance of green vs. vanilla debt instruments15 (Figure 7). India has the second largest green bond market among the emer ging markets after China (Figure 8).

The 16-member jurisdiction platform accounts for 50 per cent of the world population, almost 50 per cent of global GDP and about 55 per cent of global GHG emissions. The platform is designed as a member driven informal and inclusive entity. The Platform acknowledges that the global nature of financial markets has the great potential to help finance the transition to a green, low-carbon and climate resilient economy by linking financing needs to global sources of funding. The platform would act as a forum for facilitating exchanges and, where appropriate, coordinating efforts on initiatives and approaches to environmentally sustainable finance, in particular in the areas of taxonomies, disclosures, standards and labels, while acknowledging dif ferences in national and regional contexts. 6.30 India and United Kingdom have agreed during the 10th India-UK Economic and Financial Dialogue held on 28th October 2020 to establish a bilateral Sustainable Finance Forum to drive forward deeper cooperation between the UK and India on sustainable finance. The Forum would draw members from finance ministries/treasury and other important stakeholders from both sides. Investing in Resilience for Sustainable Development 6.31 As per the Global Climate Risk Index, in 2018, India lost US$ 37 billion due to climate events such as cyclones battering the east coast and flooding and landslides in Kerala where about a quarter million people were displaced, 20,000 houses and 80 dams were destroyed. During 1998-2017 these losses added up to US$ 79.5 billion (Eckstein, et al. 2019). On the other side, in 2019, 42 per cent of land faced drought conditions worsening the farm crisis (Kapil 2019). Chennai's record-breaking 272 mm rainfall in 12 hours (2015) affected over 10 thousand MSMEs and reportedly caused US$ 250 million in damage (Idicheria, et al. 2016). International Labour Organisation' s study concludes that India would lose 5.8 per cent of its working hours by 2030 due to heat stress. Moreover, because of its large population, India is in 221 Sustainable Development and Climate Change absolute terms expected to lose the equivalent of 34 million full-time jobs in 2030 as a result of heat stress. Although most of the impact in India will be felt in the agricultural sector, more and more working hours are expected to be lost in the construction sector, because of heat stress. These losses underscore the need for investment in building resilience and adoption of policies for mainstreaming risks through building appropriate social protection systems, including the provision of social insurance and social assistance which can help workers and their families to adapt to the consequences of heat stress (ILO 2019). Climate Risk Insurance 6.32 Climate risk insurance is an important tool for providing security against loss of livelihoods and of assets as a consequence of disasters. The basic risk faced by agriculturalists is that of weather variability and the uncertainty of crop yield. The magnitude and intensity of the same is especially high in India, considering that an overwhelming majority of farmers who excessively depend on the farming sector have extremely limited means and resources to cope with the disastrous consequences of crop failure. Thus, given the significant contribution of the agricultural sector in the Indian economy, coupled with looming \"climatic aberrations,\" crop insurance becomes a necessity to mitigate the risks associated with a majority of the country's farmers. The weather index insurance for agriculture introduced in 2003, did not find much success as it suffered from complex processes, moral hazard, adverse selection, and low penetration of institutional credit. Insurance in Indian agriculture is challenging because of - a large number of small and scattered landholdings, varying climatic and soil conditions, lack of basic data, and variety of agricultural practices, making it practically impossible to implement the scheme on a wide scale. Further, there is widespread lack of knowledge about the nature and functions of crop insurance amongst the farmers, a majority of whom are illiterate and poor . 6.33 Studies suggest moving towards parametric insurance that agrees to make payment on just the occurrence of a climate event, data for which is easily accessible. Further, the use of climate information services could also be useful. The example of the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre's Varuna Mitra which has not only benefitted 3.5 lakh farmers through its weather advisories but also provides data to insurers at panchayat scale to improve pay-outs to farmers (Manjunatha 2018) is a case in point. 6.34 W ith increasing conversion of natural/primary forests to secondary forests driven by agriculture and development (Padma 2018) risk of new infectious diseases is high; requiring climate risk insurance to include pandemic insurance as well. An example in this regard is the insurance bought by Wimbledon tennis tournament against a pandemic occurrence in 2003 following the SARS outbreak, thus receiving an insurance pay-out of US$ 142 million in 2020 which was utilised to pay the prize money and staf f wages (Insurance Journal 2020). Developmental Schemes and Protection of Environment-Need for Convergence 6.35 Many Central and State level incentive schemes (especially KUSUM and state solar policies) are promoting uptake of low carbon technologies such as decentralised solar systems for community scale water supply and irrigation as part of its agenda to build rural resilience in rainfed regions. Some water supply schemes mandate ground water assessments before approving solar based pumping installations. However, these assessments do not consider climate projections for the regions. Similarly, solar irrigation pumps are being subsidised all over the country without any incentive for farmers to use ground water judiciously. Such 222 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 1 schemes have an immense impact in reducing production losses during dry periods; but can also lead to unsustainable extraction of ground water. These incentive schemes need to be designed by considering cropping patterns, local environment, and climate projections, and should further incentivise farmers to adopt water conservation and rainwater harvesting practices. Such convergence will not only build local resilience while transitioning to low carbon technology but will also influence the credit market in developing guidelines for supporting much needed technological advancement in the agriculture sector . 6.36 The Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA) (Figure 9) in its flagship report concluded that investing US$ 1.8 trillion globally in five areas i.e. strengthening early warning systems, making new infrastructure resilient, improving dryland agriculture crop production, protecting mangroves and making water resources management more resilient-from 2020 to 2030 could generate US$ 7.1 trillion in total net benefits, as overall rate of return on such investments is high with benefit-cost ratios ranging from 2:1 to 10:1 and higher. In addition to avoiding losses, investing in the future can provide economic benefits now, by reducing risk, increasing productivity, and driving innovation while continuing to restore the environment. Failing to do so will, however , undermines potential growth and prosperity (GCA 2019). Figure 9: Benefits and Costs of Illustrative Investments in Adaptation Strengthening early warning systems Making new infrastructure resilient Improving dryland agriculture crop production Protecting mangroves Making water resources management more resilient Benefit -Cost Ratio Net Benefits Total Net Benefits $0.1T $4.0T stands for trillion. INDIA'S INITIATIVES AT THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE International Solar Alliance (ISA) 6.37 International Solar Alliance (ISA) has recently launched two new initiatives - a 'W orld Solar Bank' and 'One Sun One W orld One Grid Initiative ' - of global import that are poised to 16 This graph is meant to illustrate the broad economic case for investment in a range of adaptation approaches. The net benefits illustrate the approximate global net benefits to be gained by 2030 from an illustrative investment of US$1.8 trillion in five areas (the total does not equal the sum of the rows due to rounding). Actual returns depend on many factors, such as economic growth and demand, policy context, institutional capacities, and condition of assets. Also, these investments neither address all that may be needed within sectors (for example, adaptation in the agricultural sector will consist of much more than dryland crop production) nor include all sectors (as health, education, and industry sectors are not included). Due to data and methodological limitations, this graph does not imply full comparability of investments across sectors or countries. (GCA 2019)223 Sustainable Development and Climate Change be instrumental in bringing about solar energy revolution globally. The proposed World Solar Bank would cater to the need for dedicated financing window for solar energy projects across the members of ISA. It is expected to provide low-cost financing at favorable terms for solar ener gy projects as well as engage in co-financing with other multilateral/bilateral development financial institutions. The 'One Sun One W orld One Grid' vision was laid down by the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India at the first assembly of the ISA. The initiative aims to create an inter- connected green grid that will enable solar energy generation in regions with high potential and facilitate its evacuation to demand centers. ISA' s progress in solar rooftop programme has been equally noteworthy, with a demand of more than 1 GW aggregated from member countries. ISA has diversified its programmatic focus onto health sector, cold storage chains for agriculture & vaccines and other innovative applications of solar ener gy. 6.38 ISA's Framework Agreement mandates partnerships with various stakeholders, including public and private corporate sector, to promote sustainable, clean and affordable solar energy . To institutionalize its partnership with the Corporate sector, the ISA Secretariat has recently launched a 'Coalition for Sustainable Climate Action' comprising of global public and private corporates. The partner organisations under the coalition would benefit from the network and the platform provided by ISA to leverage and demonstrate their expertise in promoting sustainable development globally . 6.39 ISA organized the First World Solar Technology Summit (WSTS) in September 2020 with an objective of showcasing to Member Countries the state of the art and next-generation solar technologies. The summit also provided a platform to deliberate on the way forward for increasing access to new technologies at an af fordable cost. Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure 6.40 Since the launch of the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) in September 2019 at the UN Climate Action Summit, the need for disaster resilience in all aspects of human activity has been unambiguously highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic. CDRI is another expression of India's commitment to work with all the partners to address global challenges. The Coalition functions as an inclusive multi-stakeholder platform led and managed by national governments, where knowledge is generated and exchanged on different aspects of disaster resilience of infrastructure. As of December 2020, 19 countries and 4 multilateral organizations have become members of the Coalition. The CDRI is co-chaired by India and the United Kingdom (UK). 6.41 The CDRI is working on enhancing the resilience of power sector in the state of Odisha, which was impacted by Cyclone Fani on the eastern coast of India in May 2019. On transport sector, CDRI has initiated a global study on disaster resilience of airports. The study will look at the airports that were affected by disasters but which have successfully managed the extreme events. The coalition has initiated the process to carry out the national level risk and resilience assessment of infrastructure to support better decision making and policy development and thus protect infrastructure investments from disasters and climate change. In the first phase, the CDRI will develop a framework for risk and resilience assessments using Indian transportation infrastructure as the basis. Following this, a thorough analysis is intended to be undertaken in order to understand the level of impact that will be caused by disasters. A detailed vulnerability 224 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 1 assessment will be performed of the elements related to transportation infrastructure, services and operations in India. 6.42 CDRI is working on expanding its membership to include countries from all the continents and at varied level of development and risk. Future initiatives are aimed at supporting member countries in learning from disasters to support recovery and reconstruction, improve governance and financing for creation of resilient infrastructure, creation of resilience standards and decision support systems, and promoting innovation in the field of disaster resilient infrastructure. CONCLUSION AND WAY FORWARD 6.43 There is an increasing recognition that the sustainable macroeconomic development should entail an alignment of both climate and economic policies to the extent possible. India's endeavour is to ensure a robust growth and a sustainable development path while combating the climate change risks on best effort basis. India has taken a number of initiatives on both mitigation and adaptation strategies with emphasis on clean and efficient energy system; resilient urban infrastructure; water conservation & preservation; safe, smart & sustainable green transportation network; planned afforestation, as well as by supporting various sectors such as agriculture, forestry, coastal and low-lying systems and disaster management. ISA and CDRI are evidence of India' s serious action at the international level. 6.44 The country is on its track to successfully decoupling its economic growth from GHG emissions. As per the second BUR submitted to UNFCCC in 2018, India's emission intensity of GDP reduced by 21 per cent in 2014 over the level of 2005. To ensure the use of cleaner automobile fuel, India has also leapfrogged from BS-IV to BS-VI emission norms on 1st April, 2020, earlier than the initial date for adoption in 2024. The effort of the International Solar Alliance in solar energy revolution is noteworthy and it has brought to fruition the 'One Sun One World One Grid' vision laid down by the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India. 6.45 India' s proactive climate actions mainly rely on the domestic budgetary resources. Climate finance is critical to fulfil the execution of NDC targets submitted by India in a timely manner. Climate finance is an obligation of the developed countries as a part of their historical responsibility as they are the major contributors to the stock of GHG in the atmosphere accumulated since the industrial revolution. By 2020, the developed country partners had to fulfill the promised support of US$ 100 billion per year in the form of climate finance to the developing nations. This has not happened. The lack of required momentum in the scope, scale and speed of climate finance from developed to developing countries needs to be addressed. The enhanced new and additional financial resources, technological support and support in capacity building should be mobilized and delivered to strengthen the on-going climate actions in developing nations like India.225 Sustainable Development and Climate Change CHAPTER AT A GLANCE Sustainable development remains core to India's development strategy, despite several challenges emerging on account of the unprecedented crisis due to COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has challenged the health infrastructure, adversely impacted livelihoods and exacerbated the inequality in the food and nutritional availability in the country. This has reemphasized the criticality of having institutions and mechanisms that can facilitate the country to absorb exogenous shocks well. India has been taking several proactive climate actions to fulfil its obligations as per the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and equity. The first priority for India is adaptation as the country is highly vulnerable to extreme weather events. The NDC submitted by the country has been formulated keeping in mind the developmental imperatives of the country and is on a \"best effort basis\". In its NDC, India has sought to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 per cent below 2005 levels by the year 2030; achieve 40 per cent of cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030; and enhance forest and tree cover to create additional carbon sink equivalent to 2.5 to 3 billion tons of carbon dioxide by 2030. The country is on its track to successfully decoupling its economic growth from GHG emissions. As per the second BUR submitted in 2018, India's emission intensity of GDP reduced by 21 per cent in 2014 over the level of 2005. The country is relying on domestic resources to implement adaptation and mitigation action on mission mode. The financing considerations will remain critical especially as the country steps up the tar gets substantially . The implementation of NDC has started from 1st January 2021. There is a huge gap between resource availability and the requirements, implementation of wide-ranging NDC goals presents a major challenge COP 26 now scheduled in 2021 is expected to discuss and arrive at a consensus on transparency mechanism; Article 6 (market and non-market mechanisms); common time frames for nationally determined contributions; long-term climate finance etc. On finance matters, it is essential to arrive at a consensus on the definition of climate finance and on a common accounting methodology for assessment and evaluation of climate finance. In 2017, to give push to green bonds issuances in India, SEBI issued guidelines on green bonds including their listing of green bonds on the Indian stock exchanges. The cumulative issuance of global green bonds crossed US$ 1 trillion mark in 2020.226 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 1 Climate risk insurance is an important tool for providing security against loss of livelihoods and of assets as a consequence of disasters.

About 54.6 per cent of the total workforce in the country is still engaged in agricultural and allied sector activities (Census 2011) which accounts for approximately 17.8 per cent of the country' s Gross Value Added (GVA) for the year 2019-20 (at current prices). While the difficulties created by COVID induced lockdowns adversely affected the performance of the non-agricultural sectors, the agriculture sector came up with a robust growth rate of 3.4 per cent at constant prices during 2020-21 (first advance estimates). The sector has got renewed thrust due to various measures on credit, market reforms and food processing under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat announcements. Various interventions of the Government for the development of allied sectors including animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries exhibit its resolve towards tapping the potential of allied sectors to further enhance farm welfare. In addition to various measures aimed at increasing productivity and improving marketing of agricultural produce, the Government also carries out a large food management programme with a significant financial implication in terms of food subsidy. Under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, 80.96 additional foodgrains, i.e. above the NFSA mandated requirements, of 5 kg per person per month free of cost till November, 2020. Over 200 LMT of foodgrains were provided amounting to a fiscal outgo of over ` 75000 Crores. Also, under Atma Nirbhar Bharat Package, 5 kg per person per month was distributed for four months (May to August) to benefit approximately 8 crores migrants who are not covered under NFSA or state ration card entailing subsidy of ` 3109 crores approximately.Agriculture & Food Management INTRODUCTION 7.1 COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the lives of people across the globe and India is no exception to that. The farming activities also experienced the impact of this pandemic as the COVID induced lockdowns influenced the movement of farm inputs including farm machinery from one location to other. The national lockdown coincided with the commencement of the harvesting season for the Rabi crops creating further adversity for the sector. Migration of agricultural labourers to their native places during the lockdown created a shortage of farm 231 Agriculture & Food Management labourers. India's agricultural system demonstrated its resilience amid such adversities. The agriculture and allied sectors were the sole bright spot amid the slide in performance of other sectors, clocking a growth rate of 3.4 per cent at constant prices during 2020-21. Against all adversities due to COVID-19, continuous supply of agriculture commodities, especially staples like rice, wheat, pulses and vegetables, has been maintained thereby enabling food security. In order to further strengthen and support the agricultural sector, several initiatives have been taken by the Government of India under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Box 1). Box 1: Major Announcements for Agriculture and Food Management under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan Announcement Objectives ` 1 lakh crores Agri Infrastructure FundFinancing will be provided for funding agriculture infrastructure projects at farm-gate & at aggregation points and for financially viable post-harvest management infrastructure. ` 10,000 crores scheme for Formalisation of Micro Food Enterprises (MFE)Aiding 2 lakh MFEs who need technical upgradation to attain FSSAI food standards, build brands and support marketing. ` 20,000 crores for fisherman through Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY)It aims at integrated, sustainable and inclusive development of marine and inland fisheries by developing infrastructure such as fishing harbours, cold chain, markets, etc. National Animal Disease Control ProgrammeIt targets Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis by ensuring 100 per cent vaccination of cattle, buffalo, sheep, goat and pig population.

Within the agriculture sector, the share of crops has fallen from 11.2 per cent in 2014-15 to 9.4 per cent in 2018-19. The decline in the share of crops has been made up by an increase in the share of livestock and fisheries sectors.

The agricultural credit flow target for the year 2019-20 was fixed at ` 13,50,000 crores and against this target the achievement was ` 13,92,469.81 crores. The agriculture credit flow target for 2020-21 was fixed at ` 15,00,000 crores and till 30th November, 2020 a sum of ` 9,73,517.80 crores was disbursed. The Agriculture Infrastructure Fund announced as a part of Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan will further boost credit flow to the agriculture sector (Box 2). The regional distribution of the agricultural credit has, however, been skewed in favour of the Southern Region. The share of north-eastern states has been very low (Map 1). Map 1: Regional Distribution of Agricultural Credit in India in 2020-21. Source: Based on data received from DAC&FW 7.8 During the year 2020-21, in the total disbursement as on 30th November, 2020, the share of southern region in agricultural credit was more than 40 per cent while it was less than 2 per cent for the north-eastern region (NER). This low coverage of the agricultural credit in NER is because the total cultivable area in North Eastern States is only about 2.74 per cent of the total GCA of the country. Moreover, community ownership of land is prevalent in most of the NE States. These two factors affected the intake of Kisan Credit Card (KCC) loans in NER as these loans are given against land documents. The credit disbursement in the agriculture sector is in fact positively related to gross cropped area as shown in Figure 6.236 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Figure 6: Credit Disbursement and Gross Cropped Area are Positively Related AP ARUNAChAL PRADEShASSAM BIhARChGUJ hAR SIKKIMTNTELANGANA TRIPURAUP UK WB 2.753.754.755.756.757.75 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5Log (Total Crop Loans) Log (Gross Cropped Area) Source: Based on data received from DAC&FW Box 2: Agriculture Infrastructure Fund Hon'ble Finance Minister on 15.05.2020 announced a ` 1 lakh crore Agriculture Infrastructure Fund for creation of farm-gate infrastructure for farmers. Accordingly, central sector scheme of financing facility under Agriculture Infrastructure Fund was formally launched by the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India on 09.08.2020. This scheme is operational from the year 2020-21 to 2029-30. The scheme provides for medium to long term debt financing facility for investment in viable projects for post-harvest management infrastructure and community farming assets Under the scheme, ` 1 lakh crores will be provided by banks and financial institutions as loans to primary agricultural credit societies (PACS), marketing cooperative societies, farmer producers organizations (FPOs), self help group (SHG), farmers, joint liability groups (JLG), multipurpose cooperative societies, agri-entrepreneurs, startups and central/ state agency or local body sponsored public private partnership project, etc. All loans under this financing facility will have interest subvention of 3 per cent per annum up to a limit of ` 2 crores. This subvention will be available for a maximum period of 7 years. Further, credit guarantee coverage will be available for eligible borrowers from this financing facility under Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Mi cro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) scheme for a loan up to ` 2 crores. Memorandum of Understandings (MoUs) with all 12 public sector banks and 11 private sector banks have been signed by DAC&FW. A portal for the scheme has been created. As on 15.01.2021, ` 2991 crores has been 'in principle' sanctioned under the scheme to 3055 PACS by NABARD. PACS have submitted 3774 applications for loan amount of ` 2741 crores. 1695 applications have been received through the portal from entities other than PACS of which 964 applications seeking loan of ` 934 crores have been prima facie found eligible and sent to respective banks. Out of 964 applications, 230 have been sanctioned a loan amount of ` 235 crores by banks. 237 Agriculture & Food Management International Trade in Agricultural Commodities 7.9 In 2019-20, India's agricultural and allied exports amounted to approximately ` 252 thousand crores. The major export destinations were USA, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Nepal and Bangladesh. The top agriculture and related products exported from India were marine products, basmati rice, buffalo meat, spices, non-basmati rice, cotton raw, oil meals, sugar, castor oil and tea. While India occupies a leading position in global trade of aforementioned agri- products, its total agri-export basket accounts for a little over 2.5 per cent of world agri-trade. 7.10 Since economic reforms began in 1991, India has remained a net exporter of agri-products, with agri-exports touching ` 2.52 crores in FY 2019-20. An analysis of last six years of the share of top ten agricultural commodities in total value of agricultural export shows that there have been significant changes in the composition of agri- exports (Figure 7). The share of marine products in total agricultural export value has remained the largest over the period. Its share in total agricultural export value increased from 14.5 per cent in 2015-16 to close to 19 per cent in 2019-20. The share of basmati rice in total agricultural export value has also shown an increasing trend during the period. Other commodities that have witnessed an increasing trend during the period are non-basmati rice, spices and sugar. The shares of the commodities such as buffalo meat and raw cotton in total agricultural export value have, however, declined during the period. The shares of the commodities such as castor oil and tea have remained more or less stable over this period.

Minimum Support Price (MSP) 7.11 The Union Budget for 2018-19 had announced that MSPs would be kept at the level of 1.5 times of the cost of production. On the basis of the above-mentioned principle, Government recently increased the MSPs for all mandated kharif and rabi crops for 2020-21 season. 238 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 MSP of Kharif Crops 7.12 On 1st June, 2020, the Government had announced the increase in MSP for kharif crops for marketing season 2020-21. The highest increase in MSP announced is for nigerseed (` 755 per quintal) followed by sesamum (` 370 per quintal), urad (` 300 per quintal) and cotton (long staple) (` 275 per quintal). The expected returns to the farmers over their cost of production are estimated to be highest in the case of bajra (83 per cent) followed by urad (64 per cent), tur (58 per cent) and maize (53 per cent). For the rest of the crops, return to farmers over their cost of production is estimated to be at lea st 50 per cent (Figure 8).

MSP of Rabi Crops 7.13 On 21st September, 2020 the Government had announced the MSPs for all mandated rabi crops for marketing season 2021-22. The highest increase in MSP has been announced for lentil (` 300 per quintal) followed by gram and rapeseed & mustard (` 225 per quintal each) and safflower (` 1 12 per quintal). For barley and wheat, an increase of ` 75 per quintal and ` 50 per quintal respectively has been announced. The expected returns to the farmers over their cost of production are estimated to be highest in case of Wheat (106 per cent) followed by rapeseed & mustard (93 per cent), gram and lentil (78 per cent). For barley, return to farmers over their cost of production is estimated at 65 per cent and for safflower, it is 50 per cent (Figure 9).

Crop Insurance 7.14 Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) is a milestone initiative to provide a comprehensive risk solution at the lowest uniform premium across the country for farmers. As an end to end risk mitigation mechanism for farmers, the scheme extends coverage for the entire cropping cycle from pre-sowing to post-harvest including coverage for losses arising out of prevented sowing and mid-season adversities. Individual farm level losses arising out of localized calamities and post-harvest losses are also covered due to perils such as inundation, cloudburst and natural fire. The average sum insured per hectare has increased from ` 15,100 during the pre-PMFBY Schemes to ` 40,700 under PMFBY. The scheme completed five successful years of implementation on 13th January , 2021 7.15 As an endeavour to constantly improve, the scheme was made voluntary for all farmers, post its revamp in February 2020. Further the States have also been provided flexibility to rationalize the sum insured so that adequate benefits can be availed by farmers. The Scheme covers over 5.5 crore farmer applications year on year. As on 12th January, 2021, claims worth ` 90,000 crores have already been paid out under the Scheme. Aadhar seeding has helped in speedy claim settlement directly into the farmer accounts. Even during COVID lock down period nearly 70 lakh farmers benefitted and claims worth ` 8741.30 crores were transferred to the Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme was launched in 2019 to provide income support to all landholder farmer families across the country with cultivable land, subject to certain exclusions. Under the Scheme, an amount of ` 6000 per year is released in 240 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 three instalments of ` 2000 each directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. Ever since this scheme started, as on 25.12.2020, more than ` 1.10 lakh crore have reached the account of farmers. An amount of ` 18000 crore have been deposited directly in the bank account of 9 crore farmer families of the country in December, 2020 in the 7th instalment of financial benefit under the scheme. ALLIED SECTORS: ANIMAL HUSBANDRY, DAIRYING & FISHERIES 7.17 Livestock sector is an important sub-sector of agriculture in the Indian economy. It grew at CAGR of 8.24 per cent during 2014-15 to 2018-19. As per the estimates of National Accounts Statistics (NAS) 2020, the contribution of livestock in total agriculture and allied sector GVA (at constant prices) has increased from 24.32 per cent (2014-15) to 28.63 per cent (2018-19). Livestock sector contributed 4.2 per cent of total GV A in 2018 -19. Milk 7.18 India continues to be the largest producer of milk in the world. Several measures have been initiated by the Government to increase the productivity of livestock, which has resulted in increasing the milk production significantly. Milk production in the country has increased from 146.3 million tonnes in 2014-15 to 198.4 million tonnes in 2019-20* (Figure 10). Annual Growth Rate of milk production was 6.27 per cent during 2014-15, thereafter, there was a steady increase. In 2019-20*, milk production increased by 5.68 per cent as compared to the previous year. The per capita availability of milk was 407 grams per day in (2019-20*). Inter- state variability in milk production and per capita availability of milk during the year 2019-20 is shown in Figures 10 and 1 1. 7.19 As per a study on the demand for milk conducted by the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), the estimated demand for 2030 at an All India level is 266.5 million metric tonnes for milk and milk products. The rural sector has an estimated share of 57 per cent in the total consumption. The per capita consumption in the urban areas (592 ml) remains higher than the rural areas (404 ml) even in the 2030 projections.

Livestock Population and Production 7.20 According to FAOST AT production data (2019), India ranks 3rd in egg production in the world. The egg production in the country has increased from 78.48 billion in 2014-15 to 114.38 billion in 2019-20*. Annual growth rate of egg production was 4.99 per cent during 2014-15, thereafter, there has been a significant improvement in the egg production with 10.19 per cent growth registered in 2019-20* over the previous year. The per capita availability of egg was 86 eggs per annum in 2019-20*. Poultry production in India has taken a quantum leap in the last four decades, emerging from use of unscientific farming practices to commercial production systems with state-of-the-art technological interventions.

Meat production in the country has increased from 6.7 million tonnes in 2014-15 to 8.6 million tonnes in 2019-20*. The annual growth rate of meat production was 5.98 per cent in 2019-20*. RECENT INITIATIVES IN THE LIVESTOCK SECTOR 7.22 Covid-19 lockdown caused a drop in the market demand due to closure of the outlets selling livestock products. With closure of sweet shops and tea stalls, a large number of private dairies were impacted and they stopped milk procurement from the farmers. This resulted in the farmers diverting their milk to the cooperatives. As a result, milk procurement in the cooperative sector increased because, as per their mandate, they could not reject milk supplied by the farmers. The cooperatives are faced with liquidity problems due to higher conversion into milk powder and white butter caused by higher milk procurement. 7.23 Steps were taken to keep a close surveillance on the milk situation and facilitate resolution of the issues relating to the forward and backward linkages for smooth supply of milk and milk products during lockdown. As one-time support, a sub-scheme for providing interest subvention on working capital loans was designed for the financial year 2020-21 under the ongoing scheme State Dairy Cooperative & Farmers Producers Organization (SDCFPO) to provide interest subvention of 2 per cent per annum, with an additional incentive of 2 per cent interest subvention for prompt and timely repayment to the financially stressed milk unions. Consequent upon budget announcement on inclusion of livestock sector in Kisan Credit Card in February 2020, 1.5 crores dairy farmers of milk cooperatives and milk producer companies' were targeted to provide Kisan Credit Cards (KCC ) as part of Prime Minister' s Atma Nirbhar Bharat Package. Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund (AHIDF) 7.24 As a part of the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan stimulus package, a ` 15000 crores Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund (AHIDF) has been set up. The AHIDF will incentivize investments by individual entrepreneurs, private companies including MSME, farmers producers organiza tions (FPOs) and Section 8 companies to establish (i) dairy processing and value addition infrastructure (ii) meat processing and value addition infrastructure, and (iii) animal feed plant. 7.25 The Government of India will provide 3 per cent interest subvention to eligible beneficiaries. There will be a 2 year moratorium period for the principal loan amount and 6 years repayment period thereafter. The interest subvention would be released to banks every year by the Government based on entitlement claimed. The Government of India would also set up a Credit Guarantee fund of ` 750 crores to be managed by NABARD. Credit guarantee would be provided to those sanctioned projects which are covered under MSME defined ceilings. Guarantee coverage would be upto 25 per cent of the credit facility of borrowers. To ease out the application process, an online portal 'ahidf.udyamimitra.in' has been developed by SIDBI through which applicants can apply online to avail l oans under this scheme. *Data is provisional.243 Agriculture & Food Management National Animal Disease Control Programme (NADCP) 7.26 The Government has approved an ambitious scheme \"National Animal Disease Control Programme (NADCP) for control of Foot & Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis\" for vaccinating all cattle, buffalo, sheep, goat and pig population against FMD and all bovine female calves of 4-8 months of age against brucellosis. The programme has a total outlay of `13,343 crores for five years (2019-20 to 2023-24). FISHERIES 7.27 India is the second largest fish producing country in the world and accounts for 7.58 per cent of the global production. The fish production in India has reached an all-time high of 14.16 million metric tons during 2019-20. The fisheries sector contributes 1.24 per cent to the GVA and 7.28 per cent to the agricultural GVA. The export of marine products stood at 12.9 lakh metric tons with a value of ` 46,662 crores during 2019-20. The livelihood opportunities provided by this sector have been instrumental in sustaining incomes of over 28 million people in India, especially the marginalized and vulnerable communities, and has promoted meaningful socio-economic development. 7.28 The Government of India has taken several initiatives to harness the untapped potential of the sector. The centrally sponsored scheme - Blue Revolution (CSS-BR) which was launched in 2015-16 for a 5 year period with a central financial outlay of ` 3000 crores to catalyze the \"Integrated, Responsible and Holistic Development and Management of the Fisheries Sector\", ended in March 2020. The Government of India in October 2018 approved the establishment of a dedicated Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) at ` 7522 crores. By the end of November, 2020, under FIDF, project proposals with total outlay of more than `3467 crores have been approved for 13 States/UTs. As of mid January 2021, a total of 44,673 Kisan Credit Cards (KCCs) have been issued to fishers and fish farmers and an additional 4.04 lakh applications from fishers and fish farmers are with the banks at various stages of issu ance. 7.29 Realizing the potential, scope and importance of the fisheries sector, new flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) was launched as a part of Atma Nirbhar Bharat Package by Government of India with an estimated investment of ` 20,050 crores comprising of central share of ` 9407 crores, state share of ` 4880 crores and beneficiaries contribution of ` 5763 crores for a period of five years from FY 2020-21 to FY 2024-25. PMMSY aims to enhance fish production to 220 lakh metric tons by 2024-25 at an average annual growth rate of about 9 per cent. The ambitious scheme will result in doubling export earnings to ` 1,00,000 crores and generate direct and indirect employment opportunities of about 55 lakhs in the fisheries sector over a period of the next five years. PMMSY further intends to increase aquaculture productivity to 5 tonnes per hectare (up from national average of 3 tonnes per hectare), enhance domestic fish consumption and attract investments in fisheries sector from other sources. Insurance coverage for fishing vessels is being introduced for the first time under PMMSY. By mid January 2021, proposals with an outlay of ` 6,567.20 crores were received from various States/UT s against which project proposals with total outlay of ` 2309.08 crores have already been approved.244 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AND EDUCATION 7.30 Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), is a premier research organization for coordinating, guiding and managing agriculture research and education including in horticulture, fisheries and animal sciences in the entire country. A total of 172 new varieties/hybrids of field crops and 75 horticultural crops were notified/released till October, 2020 during the current year. Since, May 2014, National Agricultural Research System (NARS) under the leadership of ICAR has released and notified 1406 varieties of different field crops. As on 27.11.2020, the Council had also developed 17 biofortified varieties of field and horticulture crops to ensure nutritional security through the natural food system in the year 2020-21, taking the tally of biofortified varieties to 71. 7.31 The Council has produced 115707 quintals of breeder seed of 1330 varieties of 51 field crops. These were distributed to various public and private seed production agencies for multiplication of foundation and certified seeds. In case of vegetatively propagated field crops, fruits, vegetables and plantation crops, 169 lakh planting materials and 8.0 lakh tissue culture plantlets were also produced for farmers. Natural Resource Management and Integrated Farming 7.32 The Council has developed 60 location specific, cost effective, eco-friendly, socially acceptable multi-enterprise Integrated Farming System (IFS) models in farmers' participatory mode to reduce risk in farming, enhance farm productivity/profitability and secure livelihoods of resource poor small and marginal farmers. Bio-intensive cropping systems having higher productivity potential for different agro-climatic zones have been included in the crop production guide /package of practices of respective states. 7.33 The Council has developed an agri-voltaic system to generate electricity in interspace area of crops and to harvest rainwater from top surface of photovoltaic (PV)-module has been designed. It is a step towards achieving the ambitious target of 100,000 MW of solar PV based power generation capacity in the country and doubling the farmers' income. Demonstration and Upscaling of Climate Resilient Technologies 7.34 Climate resilient technologies are being demonstrated in 446 villages and up-scaled in about 300 cluster villages in the country. In 2020-21 (till 27.11.2020), 16355 demonstrations under Natural Resource Management (NRM) module covered 12453.93 ha area; 25325 demonstrations under crop productions technologies covered 9061.34 ha area and 48846 farm animals were covered under livestock and fisheries module for vaccination, demonstration on feed supplementation, etc. Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) organized 1644 training programmes on climate resilient agriculture involving 42655 farmers. A total of 4367 extension activities were organized to create awareness on successful climate resilient practices and technologies benefiting 80684 farmers. 7.35 In addition, 651 contingency plans have been prepared for use by the state agriculture departments in the e vent of weather aberrations and extreme climatic events. 245 Agriculture & Food Management Mechanization and Crop Residue Management 7.36 To increase availability of equipments/machines to the small and marginal farmers on hire basis, 9970, 2866 and 4170 custom hiring centres have so far been initiated in Punjab, Haryana and UP respectively. Several measures have been taken to manage crop residue which include i) distribution of 1,52,579 machines to the farmers in these states during the last two years and the current year, ii) awareness creation about in-situ crop residue management by conducting 1,817 awareness programmes, 28,247 demonstrations, 696 training programs and 130 kisan melas during last two years and current year, iii) Replacement of long duration variety with short duration paddy. With the result area under long duration variety reduced from 8.30 lakhs hectare in 2019-20 to 4.82 lakh hectare area in 2020-21, and iv) crop diversification leading to reduction in area under paddy. As a result, the crop burning events in these states reduced from 127774 in 2016 to 61332 in 2019. Reaching to the Farmers and Youth with Improved Technologies 7.37 The linking of 3.37 lakh common service centers with 721 KVKs has tremendously enhanced outreach of the KVKs and provided demand driven services and information to farmers. The improved technologies reached farmers' fields through 34432 on-farm trials and 2.44 lakh frontline demonstrations by KVKs. The production of 2.01 lakh quintals quality seeds of field crops, 348.01 lakh planting materials of horticultural crops and 409.06 lakh livestock strains and fish fingerlings were made available to farmers at a nominal cost. FOOD PROCESSING SECTOR 7.38 During the last 5 years ending 2018-19, food processing industries (FPI) has been growing at an average annual growth rate of around 9.99 per cent as compared to around 3.12 per cent in agriculture and 8.25 per cent in manufacturing at 2011-12 prices. Food processing sector has also emerged as an important segment of the Indian economy in terms of its contribution to GDP, employment and investment. The sector constitutes as much as 8.98 per cent of Gross Value Added (GVA) in manufacturing in 2018-19 at 2011-12 prices. Figure 13 presents a comparative performance of food processing sector . Figure 13: Growth of GV Country GVA Share of the GVA of FPI in Manufacturing GVA Growth of GVA in FPI Source: Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI)246 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 New Initiatives in Food Processing Sector Formalization of Micro Food Processing Enterprises 7.39 Under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) has launched a new Centrally Sponsored Scheme, Prime Minister-Formalisation of Micro Food Processing Enterprises (PM-FME) with a total outlay of ` 10,000 crores over the period 2020- 2025. The scheme is expected to benefit 2 lakh micro food processing units through credit linked subsidy. The Scheme adopts One District One Product (ODOP) approach to reap benefit of scale in terms of procurement of inputs, availing common services and marketing of products. The States need to identify one food product per district keeping in view the existing clusters and availability of raw material. Support for common infrastructure and branding & marketing would be for that product. The Scheme also places focus on waste to wealth products, minor forest products and Aspirational Districts1. 7.40 Existing individual micro food processing units desirous of upgradation of their unit can avail credit-linked capital subsidy @35 per cent of the eligible project cost with a maximum ceiling of ` 10 lakh per unit. Seed capital @ ` 40,000 per SHG member would be provided for working capital and purchase of small tools. FPOs/ SHGs/ producer cooperatives would be provided credit linked grant of 35 per cent of the eligible project cost for capital investment along the value chain. Support would be provided through credit linked grant @ 35 per cent of the eligible project cost for development of common infrastructure including common processing facility, lab, warehouse, cold storage, packaging and incubation center through FPOs/SHGs/ cooperatives or state owned agencies or private enterprise for use by micro units in the cluster. Support for marketing and branding would be provided to micro units and groups with 50 per cent grant at the state or regional level which could benefit large number of micro units in the clusters. 35 States/UTs recommended ODOPs for 137 unique products in 703 districts. ODOPs of 650 districts i n 34 States/UT s have already been approved. Operation Greens 7.41 MoFPI is implementing a central sector scheme \"Operation Greens - A scheme for integrated development of Tomato, Onion and Potato (TOP) value chain\" to provide support to farmers when prices of agri produce is low. This scheme is not meant for intervention in the market during price rise. Under the short term- price stabilization measures of the scheme, there is a provision for 50 per cent subsidy on cost of transportation and storage for evacuation of surplus production from producing area to the consumption center during the glut situation. By November, 2020, 5 approved projects (2 for tomato in AP & Gujarat, 2 for onion in Gujarat & Maharashtra and 1 for Potato in Gujarat) are under implementation for long-term integrated value chain creation. 7.42 Under Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, this scheme has been extended from tomato, onion and potato (TOP) crops to the other notified horticulture crops (Total) for a period of six months. Transport subsidy has been allowed on any fruit & vegetable through any rail service provided by Indian Railways. 1NITI Aayog has identified 1 12 most backward districts of the country as Aspirational Districts.247 Agriculture & Food Management Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme 7.43 Government gave its approval in November 2020 to introduce the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme in 10 key sectors, including food processing sector, for enhancing India's manufacturing capabilities and improving exports. The approved financial outlay for the PLI scheme in food processing is ` 10,900 crores. The food segments identified includes ready to eat/ready to cook, marine products, processed fruits & vegetables, mozzarella cheese, and innovative/or ganic products of SMEs. The scheme would also support the branding and marketing abroad. Pradhan Mantri Kisan Kisan SAMPADA Yojana, the Ministry is implementing various component schemes which, inter-alia, includes (i) Mega Food Parks, (ii) Integrated Cold Chain and Value Addition Infrastructure, (iii) Infrastructure for Agro-processing Clusters, (iv) Creation of Backward and Forward Linkages (v) Creation/ Expansion of Food Processing & Preservation Capacities, and (vi) Operation Greens.

MSP of wheat and paddy has been increased to protect the interest of farmers. II. State Governments, particularly those undertaking Decentralized Procurement (DCP), are encouraged to maximize procurement of wheat and rice by state agencies. III. Strategic reserves of 5 million tons of food grains over the existing buffer norms have been maintained to be used in extreme situations. IV. Sale of wheat and rice is undertaken through Open Market Sale Scheme (OMSS) (Domestic) to check inflationary trend of food in market.248 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Procurement of Foodgrains During the Marketing Season (KMS) 2019-20, 519.97 lakh metric tons (LMT) of Rice was procured against an estimated target of 529.05 LMT. In the ensuing KMS 2020-21, a total of 374.93 LMT of rice has been procured as on 15.01.2021. During Rabi Marketing Season (RMS) 2020-21, 389.92 LMT wheat was procured against 347.89 LMT procured during RMS 2019-20. During the Kharif Marketing Season 2020-21, a total of 4.78 LMT of coarse grains have been procured as on 18.01.2021.

At present NFSA is being implemented in all the 36 States/ UTs and they are receiving monthly allocation of foodgrains under NFSA. During the Financial Year 2020-21 (upto 18.01.2021), ` 3679.82 crores was released to State Governments as central assistance to meet the expenditure incurred on intra-State movement of foodgrains and fair price shop dealers' mar gins. 7.48 In pursuance of the pro-poor announcement made under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Kalyan Anna Yojana (PM- GKAY) scheme for additional allocation of foodgrains from the Central Pool at the rate of 5 kg per person per month free of cost for all the beneficiaries covered under Tar geted Public Distribution System (TPDS) (AAY & PHH) including those covered under Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) for a period of 3 months i.e April-June, 2020. Accordingly, about 121 LMT of foodgrain was allotted to approximately 80.96 crores beneficiaries subsidy outgo of nearly ` 46061 crores. The PMGKAY scheme was extended for a further period of 5 months i.e. July - November, 2020. Accordingly, about 201 LMT of foodgrains have been allocated for free of cost distribution to beneficiaries entailing subsidy outgo of nearly ` 76062.1 1 Crores. 7.49 Further under Atma Nirbhar Bharat Package, Government of India made allocation of free foodgrain (wheat and rice) at the rate of 5 kg per person per month for two months (May and June, 2020) to benefit approximately 8 crores migrants/stranded migrants who are not covered under NFSA or state ration card entailing subsidy of ` 3109 crores approximately. The period of distribution to migrants for already lifted foodgrains (upto 25.06.2020) was extended till 31st August, 2020. Under ANBP, on an average about 2.74 crore persons per month for the month of May and June, 2020 were covered. Thus, a total of 5.48 crore person were given around 2 LMT of rice and 0.74 LMT of wheat with total expenditure of approx Rs. 989.30 crore. 7.50 During the year 2020-21, Government of India has so far (by the end of December, 2020) allocated 943.53 lakh tons of foodgrains to States/UTs under NFSA and Other Welfare Schemes etc. as per break up given in Figure 16. Figure 16: Break up of Allocation under Various Schemes (share in per cent and quantity in lakh tons) 598.41, Festival, Natural calamity, etc. Other Welfare schemes Source: Based on data received from Department of Food & Public Distribution (DFPD)250 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Fortification of Rice and Its Distribution 7.51 To address the issue of anaemia and micro-nutrient deficiency and to promote nutrition security in the country, a centrally sponsored pilot scheme on \"Fortification of Rice & its Distribution under Public Distribution System\" was approved for a period of 3 years beginning in 2019-20 with total budget outlay of ` 174.64 crores. The pilot scheme is being funded by Government of India in the ratio of 90:10 in respect of North Eastern, Hilly and Island States and 75:25 ratio in the rest of the States. 7.52 The pilot scheme will focus on 15 Districts, preferably one district per state during the initial phase of implementation. F ollowing State Governments, namely, consented and identified their respective districts for implementation of the pilot scheme. Uttar Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have already started distribution of fortified rice under the scheme in their selected districts. One Nation One Ration Card 7.53 The Department of Food & Public Distribution in collaboration with all States/UTs is implementing a central sector scheme namely \"Integrated Management of Public Distribution System (IM-PDS)\" the validity of which is extended up to 31.03.2022. The main objective of the scheme is to introduce nation-wide portability of ration card under National Food Security Act (NFSA) through 'One Nation One Ration Card' System. This system will enable the ration card holders to lift their entitled foodgrains from any fair price shop (FPS) of their choice anywhere in the country by using their same/existing ration card. At present, the facility is seamlessly enabled in 32 States/UTs covering nearly 69 crores beneficiaries (86 per cent of the total NFSA population) in the country. Under this system, equivalent food subsidy through DBT (Cash Transfer) is provided to portability beneficiaries in Chandigarh and Puducherry instead of subsidised foodgrains. Open Market Sale Scheme (Domestic) 7.54 In addition to maintaining buffer stocks and for making a provision for meeting the requirement of the National Food Security Act (NFSA) and Other Welfare Schemes (OWS), the Food Corporation of India (FCI) on the instructions from the Government sells excess stocks out of Central Pool through Open Market Sale Scheme (Domestic) [OMSS (D)] in the open market from time to time at predetermined prices. A target of 150 lakh MT of wheat has been set for sale by FCI including retail sale, out of the Central Pool in the open market under OMSS (D) during 2020-21. For rice, this target is 50 lakh MT during 2020-21. The quantities of wheat and rice sold under the OMSS (D) during the last 4 years and FY 2020-21 are as presented in Figure 17.251 Agriculture & Food Management 7.55 A special dispensation was introduced, w.e.f. 8th April, 2020, for supply of foodgrains to all the charitable/ non-governmental organizations etc. engaged in providing relief or in running community kitchens for migrant labourers and vulnerable groups during the lock down. Under this scheme, wheat at the uniform rate of ` 21 per kilogram and rice at the uniform rate of ` 22 per kilogram are issued to charitable institutions/NGOs. There is no upper limit for allocation of foodgrains to each such organization from any FCI depot. This special dispensation was initially upto June, 2020 which has been extended at the same rate and terms and conditions for the rest of the year 2020-21. Under the scheme, till 12.01.2021, a total quantity of 1246 MT of wheat and 10418 MT of rice has been lifted by 229 and 1126 Charitable/NGOs respectively . Figure 17: Quantities of Wheat and Rice Sold under the OMSS (D) (Quantity. from DFPD * Upto 2nd tender January, 2021. Food Subsidy 7.53 The difference between the per quintal economic cost and the per quintal Central Issue Price (CIP) gives the quantum of per quintal food subsidy. In order to ensure food security to the vulnerable sections, the Government has continued with the subsidized pricing under NFSA. The CIP of wheat and rice for NFSA beneficiaries has not been revised since the introduction of the Act in 2013 from ` 200 per quintal in case of wheat and ` 300 per quintal in case of rice. On the other hand, the economic cost of wheat for FCI operations has increased from ` 1908.32 per quintal in 2013-14 to ` 2683.84 per quintal in 2020-21. Similarly, the economic cost of rice has increased from ` 2615.51 per quintal in 2013-14 to ` 3723.76 per quintal in 2020-21. Further, the NFSA provides a wider coverage than the erstwhile TPDS. These all taken together has resulted in the rise in food subsidy (Figure 18).252 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Figure 18: Trend in Food Subsidy Released by the Government of India since 2009-10 -40-30-20-10010203040 020000400006000080000100000120000140000160000180000 Food Subsidy Annual growth Annual Growth in Food Subsidy in per centFood Subsidy in crores Source: Based on data received from DFPD Notes: The total release in FY 2020-21 scheme. *Includes Small Savings Fund (NSSF) loan of ` 25000 crores to FCI. ** Includes loan of ` As on 30.11.2020. # ` 11436 crores has been reimbursed to DCP State from unutilized NSSF Loan sanctioned to FCI as per instruction of Minister of Finance in March, 2020 in FY 2019-20. Out of ` 11436 crores, ` 10000 crores has been recouped to FCI from budgetary allocation for DCP head in FY 2020-21. Storage 7.57 The total storage capacity available with FCI and state agencies for storage of foodgrains as on 31.12.2020 was 819.19 LMT, comprising covered godowns of 669.10 Covered and Plinth (CAP) facilities of 150.09 LMT. Out of the total available storage capacity of 819.19 LMT, FCI has a capacity of 407.76 LMT while state agencies have a capacity of 411.43 LMT. The stock of rice and wheat in the Central Pool as on 01.01.2021 was 529.59 LMT . 7.58 Construction of godowns has been undertaken in PPP mode in 24 states under Private Entrepreneurs Guarantee (PEG) Scheme through the private sector as well as the Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and the State Warehousing Corporation (SWC). As on 30.11.2020, a capacity of 144.06 LMT has been created under this scheme. Apart from this, godowns are also being constructed through a central sector scheme by FCI in the North Eastern States, Kerala, Jharkhand and Himachal Pradesh. The Government of India has also approved action plan with construction of steel silos in the country for a capacity of 100 LMT in public private partnership (PPP) mode with a view to modernize storage infrastructure and improve shelf life of stored foodgrains. Against this, as on 31.12.2020, a total capacity of 8.25 LMT of silos was complete d.253 Agriculture & Food Management Central Warehousing Corporation 7.59 CWC is operating 423 warehouses throughout the country with a total operational storage capacity of around 117 lakh MT. The overall capacity utilization during December, 2020 is expected to be 86 per cent. The average occupancy percentage during nine months (April to December) of FY 2020-21 was 89 per cent as compared to 86 per cent during the corresponding period of FY 2019-20. CWC has constructed 10000 MT capacity warehouse at Bhadohi (Uttar Pradesh) under PEG in the current year . Ethanol 7.60 The Government has set 10 per cent blending target for mixing ethanol with petrol by 2022 & 20 per cent blending target by 2030. With a view to achieve these blending targets, Government is encouraging sugar mills and molasses based standalone distilleries through various financial assistance to enhance their ethanol distillation capacity. The ethanol supply under Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme, which was only about 38 crore litre in 2013- 14, has increased to about 189 crores litre during Ethanol Supply Year (ESY) 2018-19 and it was 173 crores litre in ESY 2019-20. In the ESY 2020-21, about 325 crores litre ethanol is targeted to be produced to achieve 8.5 per cent blending and in ESY 2021-22, it is targeted to achieve 10 per cent blending by producing more than 400 crores litre of ethanol. Government has also allowed conversion of surplus stock of rice with FCI and Maize to ethanol so that these targets of blending can be achieved smoothly . RECENT AGRICULTURAL REFORMS : A REMEDY, NOT A MALADY 7.61 The President gave his assent on September 27, 2020 to three reforms related to agriculture sector\u2014Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act. Major provisions of the Reforms are presented below. The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 7.62 It seeks to create an ecosystem where the farmers and traders enjoy the freedom of choice relating to sale and purchase of farmers' produce. The reform grants freedom to farmers and buyers to transact in agricultural commodities even outside notified APMC mandis ensuring competitive alternative trading channels to promote efficient, transparent and barrier-free inter- state and intra-state trade. The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 20207.63 It seeks to provide for a national framework on contract farming that protects and empowers farmers in their engagement with agri-business firms, processors, wholesalers, exporters or large retailers for farm services and sale of future farming produce at a mutually agreed remunerative price in a fair and t ransparent manner .254 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 7.64 It seeks to remove commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onion and potatoes from the list of essential commodities. The reform ends the era of frequent imposition of stock-holding limits except under extraordinary circumstances. Benefits of the Farm Reforms 7.65 The farmers in India have suffered from various restrictions in marketing their produce. There were restrictions for farmers in selling agri-produce outside the notified APMC market yards. The farmers were also restricted to sell the produce only to registered licensees of the state governments. Further, barriers existed in free flow of agriculture produce between various States owing to the prevalence of various APMC legislations enacted by the state governments. 7.66 APMC regulations have indeed resulted in a number of inefficiencies and consequent loss to the farmers. The presence of multiple intermediaries between the farmers and the final consumers has led to low realization by farmers. Further, a large range of taxes and cesses levied by APMCs cuts into farmers' price realization while only a small proportion is ploughed back into the development of mandi infrastructure. Poor infrastructure at the mandis compounds the problem of price realization for the farmers. Issues related to manual weighing, single window systems and lack of modern grading and sorting processes create long delays and measurement errors that tend to be biased against the seller. Long queues of farmers waiting, most often, in the hot sun to sell their produce with limited ability to take their produce elsewhere even if the price is higher in an other mandi is a characteristic feature of APMC mandis. The delays result in large post-harvest losses to the tune of 4-6 per cent in cereals and pulses, 7-12 per cent in vegetables and 6-18 per cent in fruits. Total post-harvest losses were estimated at ` 44,000 crores at 2009 wholesale prices2. 7.67 Recognizing the above limitations of existing market regulations, various committees had recommended several reforms in the marketing of agricultural commodities. Some illustration of reports recommending agricultural market reforms is given in Box 3. 7.68 The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 will empower farmers in their engagement with processors, wholesalers, aggregators, large retailers, exporters and will provide a level playing field. It will transfer the risk of market unpredictability from the farmer to the sponsor and also enable the farmer to access modern technology and better inputs. Farmers have been provided adequate protection as sale, lease or mortgage of farmers' land is totally prohibited and farmers' land is also protected against any recovery. The farmers will have full power in the contract to fix a sale price of their choice for the produce. They will receive payment within a maximum of 3 days. As part of this law, 10000 Farmer Producer Organizations are being formed throughout the country. These FPOs will bring together small farmers and work to ensure remunerative pricing for farm 2Final Report of the Committee of State Ministers in Charge of Agricultural Marketing Reforms, Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India, 2013.255 Agriculture & Food Management produce. After signing the contract, farmer will not have to seek out traders as the purchasing consumer will need to take the produce directly from the farm. 7.69 The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 removes commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onion and potatoes from the list of essential commodities. This aims to remove fears in private investors from excessive regulatory interference in their business operations. The freedom to produce, hold, move, distribute and supply will lead to harnessing of economies of scale and will attract private sector/foreign direct investment into the agriculture sector. The legislation will help drive up investment in cold storages and modernization of food supply chain. 7.70 The three agricultural reform legislations are designed and intended primarily for the benefit of small and marginal farmers which constitute around 85 per cent of the total number of farmers and are the biggest sufferer of the regressive APMC regulated market regime. The newly introduced farm laws herald a new era of market freedom which can go a long way in the improvement of farmer welfare in India. Box 3: Some illustrations of Reports recommending Agricultural Market Reforms and the Amendments to the Essential Commodities Act 1. Expert Committee on Strengthening and Development of Agricultural Marketing - Chairman: Shri Shankerlal Guru (June 2001) The Committee underlined the need for a thorough overhaul of existing policies, regulations and legal provisions which inhibit a free marketing system. It stated that direct marketing is one of the alternative marketing structure that needs to be promoted and that the role of the private sector may be encouraged outside the purview of the APMCs. Need for development of infrastructure for quality assurance, standardization of grading and quality control was highlighted. It recommended that the Essential Commodities Act be repealed to allow a free play of market forces. 2. Report on the Taskforce on Employment Opportunities - Chairman: Shri Montek Singh Ahluwalia (July 2001) The task force recommended that benefit of decontrol must be extended to agriculture and that the Essential Commodities Act should be repealed. It was stated that restrictions on marketing of agricultural produce through APMC should be removed as they act as an impediment to development of a national market. 3. Inter-Ministerial Task Force on Marketing Reforms- Chairman : Shri R.C.A Jain (July 2001) The task force recommended that the APMC Acts should be amended by the state governments to enable the private sector to develop alternate marketing infrastructure and support services. It recommended that the Essential Commodities Act may be amended to remove restrictions on storage of agricultural produce so that substantial warehousing capacity can be created in the private sector . 4. Model Act on Agricultural Marketing - (September 2003) Under the Model Act, legal persons, growers and local authorities were permitted to apply for th e establishment of new markets for agricultural produce in any area, as against the existing provisions256 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 that allow markets to be setup at the initiative of State Governments alone. Consequently, in a market area, more than one market could be established by private persons, farmers and consumers. There was to be no compulsion on the growers to sell their produce through existing markets administered by the APMC. 5. Serving Farmers and Saving Farming - First Report - National Commission on Farmers - Chairman: Dr M.S. Swaminathan (2004) The report stressed the need for focus on post-harvest management. The report mentions that planning for infrastructure for post-harvest management should be done for each production zone adopting the well-known concept of \"Packing House\" successfully adopted by the Grape Growers' Association, NDDB, etc. The report went on to say that this would need an immediate amendment to the APMC Act by each State to decentralise the system and permit marketing by other players for achieving the ultimate goal of ensuring better returns to the growers and reasonably good quality products to the consumers. 6. Serving Farmers and Saving Farming - From Crisis to Confidence - Second Report - National Commission on Farmers - Chairman : Dr M.S. Swaminathan (2005) The report states that the role of the APMCs and the state agricultural boards needs to change from regulation to development and promotion of markets for the local products and better marketing practices. 7. Serving Farmers and Saving Farming 2006: Year of Agricultural Renewal - Third Report - National Commission on Farmers - Chairman: Dr M.S. Swaminathan (2005) The Government needs to abolish market fee on primary agricultural commodities altogether and charges for various services like loading, unloading, weighing in the APMC yard and levy one consolidated service charge for use of market infrastructures. It went on to say that allowing private players including cooperatives to establish private mandis will be a major step in providing an alternative to the farmers and lead to higher returns. The Essential Commodities Act may be put under suspended animation and revived by Government notification only when an emergency situation develops. The report also suggests that the Essential Commodities Act may be scrapped after observing the impact of placing the legislation under suspended animation for a few years. 8. Serving Farmers and Saving Farming Jai Kisan: A Draft National Policy For Farmers - Fourth Report - National Commission On Farmers - Chairman: Dr M .S. Swaminathan (2006) The State APMC Acts need to be amended to allow the private sector or cooperatives to establish markets, develop marketing infrastructure and support services, collect charges, allow marketing without the necessity of going through APMC/ licensed traders etc. Further the report underlines the need for review of the Essential Commodities Act. 9. Serving Farmers and Saving Farming - The Fifth Report Volume I and II - National Commission on Farmers - Chairman: Dr M.S. Swaminathan (2006) This report like the ones preceding it, underscores the need for reforms in the agricultural sector especially in the context of APMCs and Essential Commodities Act. 10. Draft State Agricultural Marketing (Development and Regulations) Rules, 2007 The Draft Model APMC Rules, 2007 provide details on, inter-alia, how the market committees would function.257 Agriculture & Food Management 11. Final Report of Committee of State Ministers, in-charge of Agriculture Marketing to Promote Reforms The State Ministers had recommended the amendment of APMC Act and the substitution of the system of licensing of traders/commission agents with a progressive system of registration with open and transparent criteria. The need to allow private sector to own, operate and manage markets was also underscored. 12. Budget 2017-2018 It was stated that market reforms will be undertaken and the states would be urged to denotify perishables from APMC to give opportunity to farmers to sell their produce outside the APMC and get better prices 13. Standing Committee on Agriculture, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare (Department of Agricultural, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare) : Agriculture Marketing and Role of Weekly Gramin Haats(2018-19) The Committee observed that APMC market across the country are not working in the interest of farmers due to various reasons such as limited numbers of traders in APMC markets thereby reducing competition, cartelization of traders, undue deduction in the name of market fee and commission charges, etc. The Committee was of the view that there is need to create alternative platform for marketing of agriculture produce near the production centre so that farmers can get remunerative prices for their produce. These marketing platforms may also provide them agriculture extension services to the farmers which will further help them to lower the input cost for farming. 14. Several Economic Surveys have expressed concern at functioning of the APMCs and the fact that they sponsor monopolies. Specifically, Economic Surveys for the years 2011-12, 2012-13, 2013- 14, 2014-15, 2016-17, 2019-20 focused on the reforms required in this context. The suggestions on marketing of agricultural produce include the need to provide a choice to the farmers to sell their products directly to a processing factory or the private sector, development of agriculture marketing infrastructure, amendment of the State APMC Acts and the Essential Commodities Act to ensure barrier -free storage and movement of agricultural commodities. 15. Parliament enacts three laws that usher in agricultural reforms The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 The Essential Commodities(Amendment) Act, 2020 WAY FORWARD 7.71 The objective of inclusive development in India cannot be realized without the development of rural sector which crucially depends on agriculture. Agriculture and allied activities engage almost half of India's workforce and contributes close to 18 per cent of the gross value added of 258 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 the country. Progress in agriculture (including forestry and fisheries) has a bearing on the fate of the lar gest low-income group in India. 7.72 There is a need for a paradigm shift in how we view agriculture from a rural livelihood sector to a modern business enterprise. In this context, both production and post production in agriculture needs urgent reforms to enable sustainable and consistent growth. Increase in area under irrigation, adoption of hybrid and improved seeds, increasing variety replacement ratio and augmentation in seed testing facilities will help address low productivity concerns. Adequate storage and remunerative markets for agricultural products should be the main focus of post-production management. It is also important to integrate agriculture with nutritional outcomes by means of food fortification of staples. 7.73 On the post-production front, measures like village level procurement centres, linkages between production and processing, development of rural markets, option of selling outside the APMC markets - warehouse upgradations and strengthening of railways freight operations, dedicated freight corridors among others are needed and are being taken up. These measures will not only reduce post-harvest losses but will also help realize the objective of doubling farmers' income. 7.74 All business enterprises need to optimise on inputs - both knowledge and materials. Therefore, it is also essential to impart farmers with basic education and training to transform his / her role from that of a producer to an entrepreneur. The option of setting up of rural agricultural schools for hands-on training may be explored in this regard. Allied sectors including animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries have gradually become a significant source of farm income and employment. Measures need to be taken to increase the productivity of the allied sectors along with sufficient provision for marketing of their products. Another area of emphasis is the need to strengthen agriculture extension services which are extremely important as they provide technical information to the farmer about improved agricultural practices, guidance on the use of these inputs and other services in support of their production. 7.75 The food subsidy bill is becoming unmanageably large. While it is difficult to reduce the economic cost of food management in view of rising commitment towards food security, there is a need to consider the revisio n of CIP to reduce the bulging food subsidy bill. CHAPTER AT A GLANCE \u00beIndia's agricultural sector has shown its resilience amid the adversities of COVID induced lockdowns. The Agriculture and allied activities were the sole bright spot amid the slide in GDP performance of other sectors, clocking a growth rate of 3.4 per cent at constant prices during 2020-21 (1st Advance Estimates). \u00beAs per the provisional estimates of national income released by CSO on 29th May, 2020, the share of agriculture and allied sectors in Gross Value Added (GVA) of the country at current prices is 17.8 per cent for the year 2019-20.259 Agriculture & Food Management \u00beGross Capital Formation (GCF) in agriculture and allied sectors relative to GVA in this sector has been showing a fluctuating trend from 17.7 per cent in 2013-14 to 16.4 per cent in 2018-19, with a dip to 14.7 per cent in 2015-16. \u00beIn the Agriculture year 2019-20 (as per Fourth Advance Estimates), total food grain production in the country is estimated at record 296.65 million tonnes which is higher by 11.44 million tonnes than the production of food grain of 285.21 million tonnes achieved during 2018-19. \u00beThe agricultural credit flow target for the year 2019-20 was fixed at ` 13,50,000 crores and against this target the achievement was ` 13,92,469.81 crores. The agriculture credit flow target for 2020-21 has been fixed at ` 15,00,000 crores and till 30th November, 2020 against this tar get a sum of ` 9,73,517.80 crores has been disbursed. \u00beConsequent upon budget announcement on inclusion of livestock sector in Kisan Credit Card in February 2020, 1.5 crores dairy farmers of milk cooperatives and milk producer companies' were targeted to provide Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) as part of Prime Minister' s Atma Nirbhar Bharat Package. \u00beAs of mid a total of 44,673 Kisan Credit Cards (KCCs) have been issued to fishers and fish farmers and an additional 4.04 lakh applications from fishers and fish farmers are with the banks at various stages of issuance. \u00beThe PMFBY covers over 5.5 crore farmer applications year on year. As on 12th January, 2021, claims worth ` 90,000 crores have already been paid out under the Scheme. Aadhar seeding has helped in speedy claim settlement directly into the farmer accounts. Even during COVID lock down period nearly 70 lakh farmers benefitted and claims worth ` 8741.30 crores were transferred to the beneficiaries. \u00beAn amount of ` 18000 crore have been deposited directly in the bank account of 9 crore farmer families of the country in December, 2020 in the 7th installment of financial benefit under the PM-KISAN scheme. \u00beThe livestock sector grew at CAGR of 8.24 per cent during 2014-15 to 2018-19. As per the estimates of National Accounts Statistics (NAS) 2020 for sector wise Gross Value Added of agriculture and allied sector, the contribution of livestock in total agriculture and allied sector GVA (at Constant Prices) has increased from 24.32 per cent (2014-15) to 28.63 per cent (2018-19). The contribution of the livestock sector was 4.19 per cent of total GV A in 2018-19. \u00beFish production in India reached an all-time high of 14.16 million metric tons in 2019-20. Further, the Gross Value Added (GVA) by the fisheries sector to the national economy stood at ` 2,12,915 crores constituting 1.24 per cent of the total national GVA and 7.28 per cent of the agricultural GV A.260 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 \u00beDuring the last 5 years ending 2018-19, Food Processing Industries (FPI) sector has been growing at an average annual growth rate of around 9.99 per cent as compared to around 3.12 per cent in agriculture and 8.25 per cent in manufacturing at 201 1-12 prices. additional foodgrains, i.e. above the NFSA mandated requirements, of 5 kg per person per month free of cost till November, 2020. Over 200 LMT of foodgrains were provided amounting to a fiscal outgo of over ` 75000 Crores. Also, under Atma Nirbhar Bharat Package, 5 kg per person per month was distributed for four months (May to August) to benefit approximately 8 crores migrants who are not covered under NFSA or state ration card entailing subsidy of ` 3109 crores approximately.CHAPTER08 \"In the midst of every crisis, lies great opportunity.\" Albert Einstein The Indian economy encountered a \"once in a century\" crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic that affected economic activities and consequently impacted the livelihood of billions of people. The industrial sector, not an exception to this shock, experienced a sharp decline during the period of the lockdown. The economic activity, however, started recovering as the unlocking process began. The various subcomponents of Index of Industrial Production (IIP) and eight-core index have experienced a V-shaped recovery with consistent movement being seen towards the pre-crisis levels. The broad-based quick revival of the industrial activity stemmed from remedial measures, reforms, and the sizable stimulus package announced by the Government of India (GoI) under the Atmanirbhar Bharat package. Based on the IIP , the industrial activity contracted by 1.9 per cent in November-2020 recovering from the nadir of -57.3 per cent in April-2020. Further improvement and firming up in industrial activities are foreseen with the Government enhancing capital expenditure as highlighted in the fiscal policy chapter, the vaccination drive and the resolute push forward on long pending reform measures. It is pertinent to point out that the reforms undertaken in the country are probably one of the most comprehensive among the major economies of the world.Industry and Infrastructure INTRODUCTION 8.1 The financial year 2020-21 (FY21) began amidst a global pandemic, the management of which led to countries adopting unprecedented measures that brought the economy to a grinding halt. The lockdown and the corresponding restrictions on local and global movement of people and goods, except for essential goods and services, was an exogenous shock that posed considerable challenges to the economy, created uncertainty, was responsible for extensive loss of livelihoods and led to the displacement of people. The unlocking of the economy in a phased manner has helped the economy to get back on its feet. The rebuilding of the Indian economy is hinged on various reform measures aimed at addressing concerns of businesses and support to livelihoods. India implemented policies aimed at reducing transaction costs, supporting Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), enhancing competition, fostering employment creation and securing sustenance through the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan. The performance of the industrial sector is critical given its deep backward and forward linkages with the other sectors of the economy. A strong industrial sector is a sine quo non for an Atmanirbhar Bharat. Any initiative aimed at securing a rapid recovery needs to keep industry concerns at the core of its intervention.262 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 8.2 A bouquet of measures equivalent to ` 29.87 lakh crores or 15 per cent of India's GDP were introduced as a measure of relief and support to the economy. These were subsequently backed by initiatives to further strengthen the economy. The details of the stimulus package pertaining to industry and infrastructure sector is in Box-1. Box-1: Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan Atmanirbhar Bharat is the GoI of making India a self-reliant nation. The announcements under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan were made in three tranches. The key measures pertaining to industry and infrastructure are summarized below: Atmanirbhar Bharat 1.0 I. Relief and credit support to MSMEs to fight against COVID-19. 1. ` 3 lakh crores Collateral-free Automatic Loans for Businesses, including MSMEs: The Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) has been formulated as a relief measure to the MSMEs by providing them additional funding of up to ` 3 lakh crores in the form of a fully guaranteed emergency credit line. The borrowers with up to ` 25 crores outstanding and ` 100 crores turnover are eligible. This scheme provides 100 per cent credit guarantee cover to Banks and NBFCs on principal and interest. No guarantee fee, no fresh collateral is required. 2. ` 20,000 cror es Subordinate Debt for Str essed MSMEs: Provision made for ` 20,000 crores subordinate debt for the MSMEs which are NP As or are stressed. Government to support them with ` 4,000 crores to Credit Guarantee Trust for Micro and Small enterprises (CGTMSE). Banks are expected to provide the subordinate-debt to promoters of such MSMEs equal to 15 per cent of the existing stake in the unit subject to a maximum of ` 75 lakhs. 3. ` 50,000 cror es equity infusion through MSME Fund of Funds: Government to set up a Fund of Funds with a corpus of ` 10,000 crores that will provide equity funding support for the MSMEs. The Fund of Funds shall be operated through a mother and a few daughter funds. It will provide equity funding for viable MSMEs. This scheme will help the MSMEs to expand its size and capacity and will also encourage them to get listed on stock exchanges. 4. New definition of MSME: Low threshold in the MSME definition have created a fear among the MSMEs of graduating out of the benefits. Hence, the government has revised the definition of MSME by raising the investment limit. An additional criteria of turnover has been introduced and distinction between manufacturing and service sector stands removed. Revised MSME classification is discussed in Table 9. 5. Global tenders to be disallowed upto ` 200 crores: General Financial Rules (GFR) of the Government amended to disallow global tender enquiries in government procurement of goods and services of value of less than ` 200 crores. This is a step in support of the Make in India initiative and will promote MSMEs to grow . 6. Other Measur es for MSMEs: e-market linkage for MSMEs to act as a replacement for trade fairs and exhibitions. The MSME receivables from the Government and the CPSEs to be released in 45 days. This would help the MSMEs to solve the problems of marketing and liquidity . 7. Income Tax Refund: Income tax refunds to nearly 8.2 lakh small businesses worth ` 5,204 crores has been issued with the objective to help the MSMEs to carry on their business activities without pay cuts and layof fs in these challenging times.263 Industry and Infrastructure 8. Relief of ` 1500 crores to MUDRA- Shishu loans: GoI to provide interest subvention of 2 per cent to prompt payees for a period of 12 months. Small business under MUDRA to be benefited. 9. Ease of doing business for business including MSMEs: The Government announced further enhancement of ease of doing business through the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) related measures which include (a) raising of the minimum threshold to initiate insolvency proceedings to ` 1 crores from ` 1 lakhs (which largely insulates the MSMEs), (b) special insolvency resolution framework for the MSMEs under Section 240A of the Code, (c) suspension of fresh initiation of insolvency proceedings for up to one year depending upon the pandemic situation and (d) empowering the Central Government to exclude COVID 19 related debt from the definition of \"default\" under the Code for the purpose of triggering insolvency proceedings. II. Packages for Power Sector- ` 90,000 crores liquidity injection for DISCOMs III. Real Estate: The extension of registration and completion date of real estate projects under Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA). Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs to advise States/UTs and their regulatory authorities to the following ef fect: 1. Treat COVID-19 as an event of 'Force Majeure' under RERA. 2. Extend the registration and completion date suo-moto by 6 months for all registered projects expiring on or after 25th March 2020 without need for individual applications. 3. Regulatory Authorities may extend this for another period of up to 3 months, if needed 4. Issue fresh 'Project Registration Certificates' automatically with revised timelines. 5. Extend timelines for various statuary compliances under RERA concurrently . These measures will de-stress real estate developers and ensure completion of projects so that homebuyers are able to get delivery of their booked houses within new timelines. IV . Public Sector Enterprise Policy for a New, Self-reliant India Government to announce a new coherent policy\u2014where all sectors are open to the private sector while public sector enterprises (PSEs) will play an important role in defined areas List of strategic sectors requiring presence of PSEs in public interest will be notified In strategic sectors, at least one enterprise will remain in the public sector but private sector will also be allowed In other sectors, PSEs will be privatized (timing to be based on feasibility etc.) To minimize wasteful administrative costs, number of enterprises in strategic sectors will ordinarily be only one to four; others will be privatized/ merged/ brought under holding companies. Atmanirbhar Bharat 2.0 (second tranche of measur es) provided ` 25,000 crores as additional capital expenditure to the Ministry of Road Transport and Ministry of Defence Atmanirbhar Bharat 3.0 (third tranche of measures) initiatives that impact the industrial sector include: ` 1.46 lakh crores boost for Atmanirbhar manufacturing production-linked incentives for 10 Champion Sectors (details in Box 4)264 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 ` 18,000 crores additional outlay for PM Awaas Yojana (PMA Y) -Urban Support for construction & infrastructure - relaxation of Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) & performance security on Government tenders ` 1.10 lakh crores platform for infra debt financing - ` 6000 crores equity infusion in National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) Debt Platform, ` 10,200 crores additional budget outlay will be provided towards capital and industrial expenditure for domestic defence equipment, industrial incentives, industrial infrastructure, and green ener gy 8.3 As per the latest estimates on Gross Value Added (GVA), the industrial sector is expected to record a growth of -9.6 per cent with an overall contribution in GVA of 25.8 per cent in 2020-21 (FY21). The contribution of the industrial sector has been constantly declining since 2011-12 (Figure 1). The fall in share is across the board except in case of 'Electricity, gas, water supply & other utility services' whose share in GVA has increased from 2.3 per cent in FY12 to 2.7 per cent in FY21. The performance of the various components of the industrial sector namely, manufacturing, mining and quarrying, electricity , and construction is presented in Table 1.

The IIP growth started contracting immediately after the lockdown reaching its historical low in April-2020. The calibrated and gradual unlocking process led to the resumption of economic activities translating into positive growth in IIP for the first time in September-2020 since the lockdown. The subsequent months have seen consistent improvement and the sub-components of the IIP have gradually inched towards their pre-COVID levels, a reflection of the beginning of the revival of the economy . The improvement has been broad-based in both the core and non-core components of the IIP with a few exceptions like the petroleum products in the core group that are still below the normal level. 8.5 The eight-core industries that support infrastructure, such as coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery products, fertilizers, steel, cement, and electricity have a total weight of nearly 40 percent in the IIP. The eight-core index recorded its all-time low growth of (-) 37.9 due to COVID-19 led nation-wide lockdown (April-2020). The fall in growth and index was expected as was the recovery of the index too. The eight-core industries registered (-) 2.6 per cent growth in November-2020 as compared to 0.7 per cent in November-2019 and (-) 0.9 per cent in October-2020 (Figure 2). The cumulative growth of core industries during April-November 2020 was (-) 1 1.4 per cent as compared to 0.3 per cent during April-November 2019. 8.6 T racking the level of the index apart from the YoY growth enables us to understand the revival of economic activity better. The trajectory of the eight-core index has been improving since May-2020 and further recovery/expansion is expected in remaining months of FY21. The current level (November-2020) of the seasonally adjusted eight-core index is 6 per cent lower than the pre-lockdown levels in February-2020 (Figure 3). The highlights of the performance of eight-core industries in FY21 are presented in Table 2 and the trajectory of the respective index is in Figure 4. All the sub-components of the eight-core index are inching up to the pre-COVID levels (Figure 5). Figure 2: IIP and Eight Core growth from Jan-19 on MoSPI and Office of Economic Adviser' s data. 266 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Figure 3: IIP and Eight Source: Survey calculations based on MoSPI and Office of Economic Adviser' s data.

The IIP attained a growth of (-) 1.9 per cent in November-2020 as compared to 2.1 per cent in November-2019 (Table 3 and Figure 2). The cumulative growth of IIP for the period April-November 2020 was (-) 15.5 per cent as compared to 0.3 per cent from April-November 2019. The improvement in the eight-core index and the IIP from their nadir is evident as both the indices stood at 94 per cent and 96.5 per cent of the pre-lockdown (February-2020) levels, respectively on a seasonally adjusted basis (Figure 3). 8.8 Based on the broad-sectoral classification, in November-2020, mining contracted by 7.3 per cent as against a contraction of 1.9 per cent in November-2019. The manufacturing sector recorded a growth of (-) 1.7 per cent in November-2020 as against a growth of 3.0 per cent in November-2019, and the electricity sector recorded a growth of 3.5 per cent in November-2020 as against a contraction of 5.0 per cent in November -2019 (T able 3). 8.9 Industrial activities recovered sharply except the mining sector, which is still at lower levels as compared to the pre-lockdown levels (Figure 6). A similar pattern has been observed in all the major indices captured under the Used Based Classification (Figure 7). However, performance of the primary goods sector, which has a weight of 34.05 per cent was sluggish as compared to its counterparts in the IIP . 8.10 In the following section, the IIP index is analysed at broad item levels. The IIP has 407 items/item groups (5-digit NIC classification), of which 171 had recorded growth in November-2020, which was significantly higher than 28 in April-2020 (Figure 8 and Table 4). In the past, the average number of commodities that recorded monthly growth in the pre- covid regime (from Apr-12 to Feb-20) were 217. More specifically, in November-2019 and November-2018 the number of items/item groups that recorded positive growth were 210 and 162, respectively .269 Industry and Infrastructure Table 3: Growth of Different Components of IIP from Jan-20 to Nov-20 (Per cent) Weight Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov By Sector Mining 14.4 -33.4 -16.6 -10.5 -7.1 0.5 4.2 is not strictly comparable, immediately after the lockdown with the pre-lockdown period.

The weight of the items that recorded growth was 46.05 per cent in November-2020, which was significantly higher than 5.87 per cent in the month of April-2020 (Figure 9 and Table 5). In the past (from Apr-12 to Feb-20), the number of items that recorded a monthly growth in the pre-COVID-19 regime had an average weight of 61.6 per cent. The weight of the items recording positive growth in November-2019 and November-2018 were 56.22 per cent and 52.40 per cent, respectively. Table 6 and Table 7 present the number of items that fall under different growth categories and corresponding weights in those growth categories.272 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Table 5: Weight of items/item groups recorded a growth in 2020 by Used Based Classification Total WeightJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Primary goods 34.0 28.77 32.80 1.52 0.56 0.98 1.42 0.98 1.06 goods 2.74 0.79 0.08 0.27 0.98 1.45 2.32 5.07 5.28 3.61 10.01 12.16 3.27 2.57 0.87 3.19 3.09 5.26 1.312.39 8.139.85 Table 6: Number of Items/item groups in Different Growth Brackets Growth Range Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov >10% 107112 1822 34 68 6677 122 173 102 5-10% 34 43 10 19 15 17 28 37 32 26 3-5% 22 30 2 30 7 7 412 18 16 0-3% 29 28 5 2 815 25 20 25 26 27 -3 to 0% 32 29 15 2 2 16 18 34 19 21 28 -5 to -3 % 20 15 8 3 7 7 10 13 16 14 24 -10 to -5% 4137 25 10 9 3342 38 36 17 33 -10% 12211 2323 364 336 244 220 191 138103 Source: Survey calculations based on MoSPI data.

Mining & Quarrying, Manufacturing, 'Electricity, Gas, Water Supply & Other Utility Services' and Construction had registered a growth rate of 14.9 per cent, 15.9 per cent, 15.3 per cent, and 24.4 per cent respectively in FY19. However, the share of GCF of the industrial sector had declined from 38.2 per cent in FY12 to 30.2 per cent of GDP in FY18 before an uptick (31.9 per cent) was recorded in FY19 (Figure 10a and 10b).

Credit to the Industrial Sector 8.13 Gross bank credit to the industrial sector, on a YoY basis, recorded (-) 1.7 growth in October-2020 as compared to 3.4 per cent growth in October-2019. Some of the industries recorded a nominal credit growth including the construction sectors. The laggards in the group are 'All Engineering', 'Cement & Cement Products', and 'Basic Metal & Metal Products' which recorded a YoY negative growth in October-2020 (Table 8). A long series of growth in the industrial sector credit by banks (both nominal and real growth) and share of industrial credit in non-food credit are presented in Figure 1 1a and 1 1b respectively . Performance of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) 8.14 The public sector enterprise policy enunciated by the Government in November 2020, spells a complete change in paradigm as compared to its policy of import substitution and self- sufficiency which became the basis of the Mahalanobis Plan in 1956. However, the inherent inefficiencies leading to low productivity in the PSEs, high-cost structure and strained public finances led the GoI to privatize the PSUs after 1991. Thus, began the journey of privatisation/ disinvestment in the country .274 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Table 8: Industry-wise Deployment of Gross Bank Credit (YoY change, in Per cent) Industry Mar-19 Oct-19 Mar-20 Oct-20 Mining & Quarrying (incl.

This policy to withdraw has been a subject of discussion in several economic surveys (more specifically 2000-01, 2001- 02, 2002-03) reflecting the deliberations in the Government on the matter . 8.16 Under the aegis of the Atmanirbhar Bharat Mission, the government has proposed to rationalise the participation of the CPSEs in commercial activities. It has been argued that the existence of the CPSEs should only be in the 'strategic sectors'. Accordingly, the number of PSEs in the strategic sector will ideally be limited to four- others would either be merged or privatized or brought under holding companies. Further, the CPSEs in the non-strategic sectors would be privatized as per guidelines issued. This initiative is expected to bring healthy competition in sectors and will also assist the Government to focus extensively on 'strategic sectors.' 8.17 While disinvestment and rationalization of some the CPSEs is being planned, there is also a need to strengthen the ones that would be retained in their respective sectors so as to fully meet with the expectations of the government. An important step in this direction would be to completely revamp the Boards of the CPSEs to reorganize their structure, enhance their operational autonomy coupled with strong corporate governance norms including listing on stock exchanges for greater transparency. Department of Public Enterprises has separately initiated revamping of Performance Monitoring system of the CPSEs to make it more objective and forward-looking based on sectoral indices/benchmarks. Also, certain reforms in the direction of timely closure of sick and loss making the CPSEs and disposal of their assets have been initiated. 8.18 In view of COVID-19 outbreak, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs has extended the last date for conducting AGM in case of all the companies including CPSEs to 31st December 2020. Hence, there has been a delay in conducting annual audit and in preparing financial statements of the CPSEs. As of January 15, 2021, based on provisional information with Department of Public Enterprises, there are 366 CPSEs as of March 2020. Of these, 256 are in operation, but only 171 CPSEs booked profit during FY20. The total profit of profit-making CPSEs was ` 1.38 lakh crores in FY20, whereas the consolidated loss of loss-making enterprises was ` 44,816 crores. The overall net profit of the CPSEs declined by 34.6 per cent to reach ` 93,295 crore in FY20 from ` 1.43 lakh crore in FY19. CPSEs are operating in 4 sectors - Agriculture, Mining & Exploration, Manufacturing, an d Services. Corporate Sector Performance 8.19 As per the RBI report on corporate performance, demand conditions in the manufacturing sector moved to the path of recovery with a softer contraction of 4.3 per cent (Y oY) in nominal sales for Q2:2020-21 after a contraction of 41.1 per cent in the previous quarter due to pandemic led country-wide lockdown. The recovery was led by iron and steel, food products, cement, automobile, and pharmaceutical companies. The net profit for the manufacturing sector contracted by 7.8 per cent in Q2:2020-21 (Figure 12a and 12b).276 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Figure 12: YoY growth in various indicators of listed Manufacturing Companies in the Private Corporate Sector (in per cent) A. Sales and Expenditure B. Net Profit calculations based on RBI data. Ease of Doing Business 8.20 The GoI is committed to facilitating a pro-business environment to enable the country to become the global hub of manufacturing and economic activities. Several measures have been taken resulting in the simplification and rationalization of many existing and age-old rules and regulations. The introduction of information technology and single window clearance to make governance more efficient and effective were some of the other concrete steps taken by the Government to improve the environment of doing business. As per the Doing Business Report (DBR), 2020, the rank of India in the Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) Index for 2019 has moved upwards to the 63rd position amongst 190 countries from a rank of 77 in 2018. India has improved its position in 7 out of 10 indicators, inching up to the international best practices. The DBR, 2020 acknowledges India as one of the top 10 improvers, the third time in a row, with an improvement of 67 ranks in three years. It is also the highest jump by any large country since 2011. India's progress in EoDB rankings since 2009 and the comparative position of India vis- \u00e0-vis its peer group in DBR 2020 are shown in the Figure 13(a & b) and Figure 14. 8.21 Further, the leads and laggards within the EoDB index of India is presented in Figure 15 (cross section analysis for 2019) and Figure 16 (intertemporal analysis 2015-2019). As per the DBR 2020 report, the lead subcomponents of EoDB were 'getting electricity', 'trading across borders' and others (Figure 15, bars shaded in green), whereas the main laggards (Figure 15, bars shaded in red). 8.22 Merely comparing the subcomponents of the EoDB at a point in time may not give an appropriate picture of overall leads and laggards in the index because it doesn't capture the policy initiatives and reforms taken in the recent past. Therefore, it would be more concrete to have an inter-temporal analysis of subcomponents. Figure 16A shows the trend in scores of 277 Industry and Infrastructure different subcomponents of the EoDB index. It is evident from the Figure 16a that the indicators that seem to be laggard in the EoDB-2019 like, 'paying tax' and 'resolving insolvency' have actually striven towards the frontier but still need additional efforts and policy support to be at the frontier. Contrary to this, the indicators like 'protecting the minority investor' and 'getting electricity' may seem like laggard in intertemporal analysis but in reality they are very close to the frontier (Figure 16B). The major causes of worry are the subcomponents that are laggards in both cross-section and an inter-temporal analysis like 'registering the property' and 'enforcing the contracts'. in Ease of Doing BusinessFigure 13b: India's Score in Ease of Doing Business (DB17-20 methodology)133 134 132 132 134 142 130 130 100 77 6350 60 70 80 90 100110 120 130 140 150 2009 201020112012 2013 2014201520162017 2018 201954.555.960.967.571.0 505560657075 2015 20162017 2018 2019 Survey calculations based on EoDB data.

Startups have the potential to be the engine of growth in the medium to long run. To facilitate the growth of startups, GoI had announced the \"Startup India, Stand-up India\" initiative. The action plan is based on the three pillars \"Simplification and Handholding\", \"Funding Support and Incentives\", and \"Industry-Academia Partnership and Incubation\". As on December 23, 2020, GoI has recognized a total of 41061 startups and 4,70,000 jobs have been reported by more than 39,000 startups. The Government has taken several initiatives to promote the startups (Box 2). Box 2: Initiative Taken by GoI to Support Startups in India 1. Startups Intellectual Property Protection (SIPP) scheme enables a start-up to seek assistance from any empanelled facilitator to file and prosecute their application. The facilitator can claim payment for the services given to the start up from the Office of the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trademarks (O/o CGPDTM) on submission of certificate in prescribed format. As of June-2020, 510 patent facilitators and 392 trademark facilitators have been empanelled to provide free-of-charge services to Startups. The figures in the box provide information on filing of patent applications and grant of patent (Figure 2.1), and filing of tardemark application and its registration (Figure 2.2), in general and particularly for startups. Box Figur e 2.1: Patent Application filed and granted Granted * For Apr-Oct 2020 2. The Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS) with a total corpus of Rs. 10,000 crores was established with contribution spread over the 14th and 15th Finance Commission cycle based on the progress of implementat ion. As of 1st December 2020, SIDBI has committed ` 4326.95 crores to 60 SEBI registered Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs). These funds have raised a corpus fund of `. 31,598 crores. ` 1270.46 crores have been drawn from the FFS and ` 4509.16 crores have been invested into 384 startups.280 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 3. So far 319 startups have been granted income tax exemptions till November-2020. 4. Startup Yatra (an initiative that travels to Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities of India to search for entrepreneurial talent by conducting day long bootcamps) has been conducted across 23 States in 207 districts impacting 78346 aspiring entrepreneurs. A total of 1,424 incubation offers have been given to the startups as a result of this initiative. 5. Further to boost innovation in the sector and encourage the youths to secure their rights on technology and the product developed by them, startup have been provided 80 per cent rebate in patent filing fees and 50 per cent rebate on trademark filing fees. Additionally , facility of expedited examination of patent applications to reduce the time taken in granting patents is also available to the startups. As of June-2020, 3618 patent applications were granted 80 per cent rebate on the filing fee and 6832 trademark applications were granted a 50 per cent rebate on filing fee. Box Figur e 2.2: Trademark Applications filed and granted * For Apr-Oct 2020 Survey calculations based on DPIIT data. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) 8.24 FDI is a one of the major sources of investment and investment financing that drives the economic growth in the country. The FDI flows are also associated with the enhancement of productivity, skills and technology development in the country. The proactive policy measures and improvement in the ease of doing business in the country resulted in massive improvement in FDI inflows. The FDI equity flows have been on the upswing since FY13. During FY20, total FDI equity inflows were US$49.98 billion as compared to US$44.37 billion during FY19. The similar number for FY21 (up to September-2020) was US$30.0 billion. The bulk of FDI equity flow is in the non-manufacturing sector leading to a reduction in the share of manufacturing in the FDI flows (Figure 17). Within the manufacturing sector, industries like automobile, telecommunication, metallur gical, non-conventional energy , chemical (other than fertilizers), food processing, and petroleum & natural gas get the bulk of FDI equity flows. These industries together accounted for about 67 per cent of FDI equity flows into the manufacturing sector in FY20 (Figure 18).281 Industry and Infrastructure Figure 17: FDI Equity Total (LHS) Share of Manufacturing (RHS)* Apr-Sep 2020 Source: Survey calculations based on DPIIT data.

SECTOR WISE ISSUES AND INITIATIVES Steel 8.25 Steel is one of the critical inputs to industries, urban development and infrastructure development. Taking cognizance of the requirement of this critical input in these crucial pillars of economic growth, the National Steel Policy, 2017 (NSP-17) envisioned significant expansion in production capacity while being globally competitive. The NSP-17 aims at achieving a crude steel capacity of 300 million tonnes (MT) and a finished steel capacity of 230 MT with a per capita consumption of 158 kg by 2030-31 (Figure 19).282 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 8.26 India is the second-largest producer of crude steel only after China. India is also the second- largest consumer of steel. However, its per capita total finished steel consumption was around 74.7 kg during FY20 as against the global average of 229 kg. Further, the capacity utilization in crude steel plants continues to be low (Figure 20). Figure 19: Production & Consumption of finished steel (Million Tonnes)Figure 202072747678808284 FY14 FY15 FY16FY17FY18FY19FY20 Source: Survey calculations based on Ministry of Steel's data. Source: Survey calculations based on Ministry of Steel's data. 8.27 Recently, the GoI has taken various initiatives under the Atmanirbhar Abhiyan to enhance the domestic production of steel such as inclusion of 'Speciality Steel' incorporating four different product categories for incentives under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme; offering steel to MSMEs that are members of Engineering Export Promotion Council at export parity price under the Duty Draw Back scheme of DGFT; measures to provide preference to domestically produced iron and steel in government procurement, where aggregates estimate of iron and steel products exceeds ` 25 crores; protecting the industry from unfair trade through appropriate remedial measures including imposition of anti-dumping duty and countervailing duty on the products in which unfair trade practices were adopted by other countries. Coal 8.28 Coal is the one of the most important and abundant fossil fuel in India. It accounts for 55 per cent of the country's energy needs. Coal is not only the primary source of energy in the country but is also used as an intermediary by many industries such as steel, sponge iron, cement, paper , brick-kilns, etc. 8.29 In the FY20, the production of raw coal in India was 729.1 million tonnes (MnT) with a minuscule growth of 0.05 per cent over the previous year (Figure 21a and 21b). In FY21 (April-October), all India coal production was 337.52 MnT, thus declining by 3.3 per cent YoY . The contraction in production is attributable to COVID-19. India is also an importer of coal 283 Industry and Infrastructure importing 248.54 MT of coal in FY20, a growth of 5.7 per cent over FY19. The ener gy supply in India is heavily coal-dependent. Nevertheless, the GoI has taken many measures to strike a balance between ener gy needs and environment friendliness (Box 3). Figure 21a: Coal Production in India (MnT)Figure 21b: Demand Source: Survey calculations based on Ministry of Coal's data. Box 3: Measures Taken by GoI in the Coal Sector A. Clean Coal Creating carbon sink: About 54500 ha land has been brought under green cover by planting 132 million trees - estimated carbon sink of 2.7 lakh tonnes of CO2 equivalent/year. Plan to cover 20000 ha of additional area by plantation of around 50 million trees by 2030. Two Coal Bed Methane (CBM) Projects with considerable potential for carbon footprint reduction are in the pipeline Surface coal gasification projects (100 million tonnes (MT) coal by 2030) with relatively lesser carbon footprint. First mile connectivity projects: transportation of coal from pitheads to dispatch points. B. Amendment in Act & Rules and other measures Several amendments were brought into the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015 through the Mineral Laws (Amendment) Act, 2020 enacted on 13.03.2020. A total of 11 coal blocks are allocated under Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) (MMDR) Act. Further, directions had been issued to Nominated Authority for allocation of 25 coal blocks by auction for sale of coal Of the auction of 38 coal mines for commercial mining in June-2020, 19 were successfully auctioned (a success rate of 50 per cent as compared to 30 per cent in the past).284 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME) 8.30 The GoI has undertaken numerous initiatives to empower the MSMEs to tide over the present crisis and become drivers of growth for the Indian economy. With more than 6 crores MSMEs, the sector has been the backbone of the economy and plays a crucial role in employment generation and in contribution to GDP. The sector employs more than 11 crores people, contributes roughly 30 per cent to the GDP, and contributes half of the country's exports helping in building a stronger and a self-reliant India. 8.31 The MSME sector was one of the worst hit sectors during the nation-wide lockdown. Several corrective and supportive measures have been taken to bring the sector on track. The first among those is the revision of the investment criteria in the MSME definition (Table 9 and Box 4). The need for a change that provides small firms the incentives to grow and thereby reap economies of scale was argued for in the Economic Survey 2018-19 Volume I (Chapter-3 Nourishing Dwarfs to become Giants: Reorienting policies for MSME Growth). This upward revision in investment criteria is expected to make them globally competitive and facilitate robust expansion of the MSMEs in the country. It will help in unleashing the economies of scale in production without the fear of forgoing the benefits of an MSME unit. Some of the important measures taken by the GoI as part of the Atmanirbhar Bharat package is highlighted in Box 1. In addition, several other interventions have also been taken like the Champions Portal (Box 5) and launch of Udyam registration portal on July 1, 2020, which aims at reducing transaction time and cost for entrepreneurs and promote ease of doing business.

Such investment was to be calculated at the original price thereof. This had disadvantaged the sector as it disincentivized investment and prevented the MSMEs to reap the benefits of economies of scale and contribute more significantly to employment generation. In June-2020, GoI revised the investment limits upwards and also included annual turnover of the enterprise as the additional criteria for the classification of MSMEs. The calculation of such investment would now be linked to the Income Tax Return as filed under the IT Act, thus allowing for annual depreciation. The need for the revision in the MSME definition was carefully evaluated and announced after stakeholders' consultation and due diligence in accordance with the provision of MSMED Act, 2006. The Economic Survey (2012-13 and 2018-19) highlighted the concerns and issues in the MSME sector and the need for revamping the ecosystem for the MSMEs. The GoI had also attempted to amend the MSME Act in 2015 and 2018 to boost the MSME sector. The 2015 Bill proposed an upward revision in investment ceiling limits whereas the 2018 Bill attempted to replace investment criteria with turnover criteria and remove the distinction between manufacturing and services. The Department-Related Parliamentary Standing Committee (DRPSC) on Industry (2015) adopted the 268th report which contains the recommendations regarding adoption of the Bill, without any change. The Committee had in its 245th Report extensively examined the implementation of the MSMED Act, 2006 and had given recommendations pertaining to Chapters IV and V of the parent Act. The Committee had generally agreed to enhance the investment limits for the classification of MSME sector in view of inflation. It had observed: \"Considering the inflation and dynamic market situation, the Committee feels that definition of MSMEs as provided in the Act may be revised every five years.\" Committee of Secretaries in its meeting held on 11.1 1.2016 recommended addition of \"turnover\" and/or \"employment\" as criteria for defining MSMEs. After the deliberation, the 2015 Bill was withdrawn and the 2018 Bill was introduced on 23.07.2018. The DRPSC on Industry (2018), carefully evaluated the 2018 Bill and had mentioned in the report that the \"classification based on investment in plant and machinery has a number of disadvantages as it prevents MSMEs to become competitive in the market, inhibits investment to modernize, upscale, improve productivity and technology upgradation due to rigor of investment thresholds.' ' The DRPSC report (2018) further mentions: '...the extent of financial limits fixed in 2006 for MSMEs are no longer relevant, given the impact of inflation. Most of the Industry Associations and stakeholders have, therefore express the need for changing the present criteria of investment in plant and machinery to annual turnover as criterion for classification of MSMEs.' The DRPSC report (2018) also says: '...the problem with employment criteria in the Indian context is the non-availability of reliable/verifiable sectoral data and the seasonal variance in labour engagement. The employment system, if taken into consideration, will increase the need for inspection, which will involve huge transaction cost and could place a question mark on the veracity of the figures given by the enterprises in different Sectors. Moreover, it will also lead to large number of litigations.' The 2018 Bill lapsed on dissolution of the Sixteenth Lok Sabha on 25.05.2019.286 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Apart from the Government, the RBI also constituted an Expert Committee on Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (2019) which also recommended using the annual turnover as the criteria instead of investment. The Committee debated the merits of an employment-based definition and recognized that while this was an additional feature preferred in some countries, this definition would pose challenges in implementation. On the basis of the latest observations of the DRPSC and consultations with stakeholders, the criteria were changed and the notification dated 26th June, 2020 was issued thereof. Box 5: CHAMPIONS online platform for MSME In a major initiative, on 9th May, 2020, the GoI launched CHAMPIONS online platform to help and handhold the MSMEs. 'CHAMPIONS' stands for C reation and Harmonious Application of Modern Processes for Increasing the Output and National Strength. It is an ICT based technology system aimed at making the smaller units big by solving their grievances, encouraging, supporting, helping and handholding them throughout the business lifecycle. The platform facilitates a single window solution for all the needs of the MSMEs. It is a technology backed control room-cum-management information system. In addition to ICT tools including telephone, internet and video conference, the system is enabled by Artificial Intelligence, Data Analytics and Machine Learning. It is also fully integrated on real time basis with GoI's main grievances portal CPGRAMS and MSME Ministry's other web based mechanisms. As part of the system, a network of 70 control rooms have been created in a Hub & Spoke Model. The Hub is situated in New Delhi in Secretary MSME's office. The spokes are in the States in various offices and institutions of the Ministry . The GoI has also onboarded public sector banks to provide extended support for finance facilitation/ resolving through CHAMPIONS platform . Textile and Apparels 8.32 The textile and apparel industry plays an important role in the overall social and economic development of the country. The textile and apparel industry contributed 2 per cent in the overall GDP and 11 per cent of total manufacturing GVA in FY20 and provided total direct and indirect employment of about 10.5 crore people. The sector is the second-largest employment generator in the country, next only to agriculture. Most important with a major part of this workforce being women, it plays a vital role in women empowerment and in the overall social development of the country. The GoI is implementing several schemes cutting across sectors such as the Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (ATUFS), Scheme for Integrated textiles park (SITP) and a scheme called Samarth. ATUFS, is a revised version of TUFS and has the objective to modernize and upgrade the technology of the Indian textile industry. SITP is for providing world class infrastructure facilities. Of the 56 textile parks which were sanctioned under SITP, 23 have been completed so far. Samarth focusses on capacity building in the textile sector. In addition, other schemes specific to silk, jute, wool, handloom and handicraft sectors are also being implemented.287 Industry and Infrastructure 8.33 India is the sixth-largest exporter of textile and apparel products after China, Germany, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Italy. India is well known in the global market for many products including cotton yarn, fashion garments, hand-made carpets, etc. The designing capability of this industry is respected worldwide, which has helped the country to build its image as an industrial powerhouse. The sector is, however, vulnerable to several internal and external economic challenges that af fect its overall performance. Box 6: Production Linked Incentive Scheme The Atmanirbhar Bharat has brought manufacturing at centre stage and emphasized its significance in driving India's growth and creating jobs. A strong, vigorous and dynamic manufacturing sector will be a driver of growth. Countries across the world, which have transitioned from low to high per capita income, have heavily relied on manufacturing and export led growth. This points to the need for a well-planned strategy to attract investment, ensure efficiency and economies of scale, and make Indian manufacturing companies globally competitive. W ith the objective of enhancing India's manufacturing capabilities and exports, the GoI has introduced the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme in the 10 key sectors under the aegis of Atmanirbhar Bharat (Table below). The scheme will be implemented by the concerned ministries with an overall expenditure estimated at ` 1.46 lakh crores and with sector specific financial limits. The scheme will make Indian manufacturers globally competitive, attract investment in the areas of core competency and cutting-edge technology; ensure efficiencies, create economies of scale, enhance exports, provide conducive manufacturing ecosystem, and make India an integral part of the global supply chain especially for the 10 sectors identified under the scheme. Further the scheme will also establish backward linkages with the MSME sector in the country which in turn will lead to more inclusive growth and create huge employment opportunities.

In the absence of adequate infrastructure, the economy operates at a suboptimal level and remains 288 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 distant from its potential and frontier growth trajectory. The strong backward-forward linkages of the infrastructure sector are well established. Therefore, investment in infrastructure is quintessential for more rapid and inclusive economic growth. 8.35 GoI launched the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) for the FY 2020-2025 to facilitated world class infrastructure projects to be implemented. This first of its kind initiative will boost the economy, generate better employment opportunities, and drive the competitiveness of the Indian economy. It is jointly funded by the Central Government, State Government, and the private sector (Figure 22 and 24). The NIP was launched with the projected infrastructure investment of ` 111 lakh crore ($1.5 trillion) during the period 2020-2025 (Figure 22). The sectors like energy , roads, urban infrastructure, railways have a major share in the NIP (Figure 23). Figure 22: Annual investments and share of funding (In lakh 8.36.4 over beyond 2025. Since NIP is up to 2025, this part has been clubbed together and is not projected year wise. Source: Survey calculations based on NIP data. Figure 23: NIP project by sectors Figure 24: Funding under based on NIP data. Source: Survey calculations based on NIP data. 289 Industry and Infrastructure 8.36 In India, private investment in infrastructure has come mainly in the form of Public- Private Partnerships (PPPs). PPPs help in addressing the infrastructure gap as well as improve efficiency in infrastructure service delivery . 8.37 The GoI set up the Public Private Partnership Appraisal Committee (PPPAC) responsible for the appraisal of PPP projects in the Central sector. During FY20, PPPAC recommended 5 projects with total project cost of ` 4,321 crore. Out of these 5 projects, 4 are railway sector projects (passenger train projects) and 1 is port sector project. In FY21, PPPAC recommended 7 projects with total project cost of ` 66,600.59 crore. Out of these 7 projects, 1 is a telecom sector project, 3 are railway sector projects (2 station redevelopment projects & 1 passenger train project), 2 are MHA sector projects (Eco-tourism projects) and 1 is port sector project. 8.38 In FY21, the GoI approved the continuation of the revamped Infrastructure Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme till 2024-25. Revamping of the proposed VGF scheme will attract more PPP projects and facilitate the private investment in the social sectors (Health, Education, Waste Water , Solid Waste Management, Water Supply etc.). The revamped Scheme is mainly related to introduction of the two sub-schemes for mainstreaming private participation in social infrastructure (Box 7). Box 7: Scheme in Viability Gap Funding (VGF) Sub scheme -1 to cater to social sectors such as Waste Water Treatment, Water Supply, Solid Waste Management, Health & Education sectors etc. The projects eligible under this category should have at least 100 per cent operational cost recovery. The Central Government will provide maximum of 30 per cent of total project cost (TPC) of the project as VGF and State Government/Sponsoring Central Ministry/Statutory Entity may provide additional support up to 30 per cent of TPC. Sub scheme -2 to support demonstration/pilot social sectors projects. The projects may be from health & education sectors where there is at least 50 per cent operational cost recovery. In such projects, the Central Government and State Governments together will provide up to 80 per cent of capital expenditure and upto 50 per cent of operation & maintenance costs for the first five years. The Central Government will provide a maximum of 40 per cent of the TPC of the project. In addition, it may provide a maximum of 25 per cent of operational costs of the project in first five years of commercial operations. Road Sector 8.39 India runs on the road, be it the passenger or goods movement, road transport is the dominant mode of transportation in the country. The share of the transport sector in the GVA for FY19 was about 4.6 per cent of which the share of road transport contributed roughly 67 per cent (Figure 25). 8.40 The road network is the backbone of the transport system in India and it is very well integrated with the multi-modal system of transportation, which provides crucial links with airports, railway stations, ports, and other logistical hubs. With 63.86 lakh kms of rural-urban roads and national-state highways, India is next only to the United States of America that has a road network of 66.45 lakh km. With the proactive policy initiatives in the sector, the road network has continuously been expanding in the country (Figure 26 and Figure 27).290 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 8.41 During the decade ending in FY19, the national highways recorded a CAGR of 7.25 per cent followed by rural roads (6.25 per cent) and urban roads (4.27 per cent). The pace at which roads have been constructed has grown significantly from 12 kms per day in 2014-15 to 30 kms per day in FY19 before it moderated in FY20. The decline in the construction of road per day in FY21 is mostly on account of the COVID-19 shock (Figure 28). With the unlocking of the economy, construction of roads is expected to return back to the high pace attained before COVID-19.

Civil Aviation 8.43 The aviation market of India is one of the fastest growing in the world. India's domestic traffic has more than doubled from around 61 million in FY14 to around 137 million in FY20, a growth of over 14 per cent per annum. From the third largest domestic aviation market, it is expected to become the third largest overall (including domestic and international traffic) by th e year FY25. The performance indicators of civil aviation sector is presented in Figure 30A to 30 D. 8.44 Despite the severe challenges posed by Covid-19, the Indian aviation industry has persevered through the crisis and demonstrated long-term resilience and full commitment to serve. The Vande Bharat Mission was launched on 7th May 2020 to evacuate stranded Indians across the world. It has thus reported over 30 lakhs passenger arrivals by 13 December 2020, with over 27 lakhs facilitated through chartered flights and Air India Group, making it the largest evacuation mission in human history (Figure 31a). The air cargos took the lead in transporting 292 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 life-critical supplies to the remotest corners of India under the Lifeline Udan initiative and also in seamlessly handling the imports of essential medical supplies. Figure 31b indicates that the air cargo started recovering and tending towards normal levels as the economic activities picked up.

Government has also entered into air-links or air transport bubble arrangements with 23 countries to facilitate the movement of passengers between the respective countries and India. Box 8: Initiatives to ensure smooth and efficient handling of Cargo during Lockdown COVID Ensured 24 x 7 operations of the cargo terminal facilities, with suitable health safety measures. Incentivised early clearage of air cargo warehouses at airports to leave clear passage for essential shipments. Large increase in freighters aircraft from 6 to 20 dedicated air freighters Air freight capacity added with over 150 passenger aircraft deployed as car go-on-seat flights Created dedicated facilities of 3,800 sqm in record 6 days for storage and distribution of import cargo medical supplies at Delhi airport.

Facilitated growing demand of air freighter operations to compensate shrinkage in belly-hold cargo capacity Dedicated team to ensure fast-connect for all temperature-controlled car go. Port and Shipping 8.46 The ports and shipping sector is the backbone of international shipment of goods and services. It not only facilitates international trade but also reduces the cost of international shipping and waiting period at the ports. In India, around 95 per cent (68 per cent) of total volume (value) of international trade is transported by sea. 8.47 India is endowed with a rich coastline of ~7500 km and has a strategic location on key international maritime trade routes. To harness and unleash the potential benefit of navigable waterways, the GoI has embarked on the ambitious Sagarmala Programme to promote port-led development in the country and reduce logistics costs for trade. 8.48 The Sagarmala program has identified 500+ projects under four pillars\u2014 211 port modernization projects, 200 port connectivity projects, 32 port-led industrialization projects, and 62 coastal community development projects which can unlock the opportunities for port- led development and are expected to mobilize more than ` 3.59 lakh crores of infrastructure investment. Between July 2019 to October 2020, 37 Sagarmala projects worth ` 8,461 crores have been completed which comprise 17 projects of port modernization worth ` 2,721 crores, 14 port connectivity projects worth ` 5,372 crores and 6 coastal community development projects worth ` 368 crores. 8.49 The installed capacity of major ports in India has increased to 1534.91 MTPA in March-2020 as compared to 871.52 MTPA in March-2014. The major ports handled traffic of 704.82 MT during FY20. GoI has also been striving to improve operational efficiencies of major ports through mechanization, digitization, and process simplification. The average turnaround time in FY20 improved to 61.75 hours as against 126.96 hours in FY11 and 96 hours in FY15 (Figure 32). The average output per ship berth day has increased from 12,458 tonnes in FY15 to 16,433 tonnes in FY20. Unlike the preconceived notion that the port which contributes more in total traffic has a higher turnover time, the evidence suggests that the average turnover time is not significantly associated with the volume of traffic handled by the port (Figure 33). Irrespective of total traffic there are s ome major ports that are efficient on turnaround time and vice-versa. Railways 8.50 Indian Railways (IR) with over 67,580 route kms, is the third-largest network in the world under single management. During the FY20, IR carried 1.2 billion tonnes of freight and 8.1 billion passengers - making it the world's largest passenger carrier and fourth-largest freight carrier. IR endeavours to provide safe, efficient, and competitive means of transport by adopting technological changes including through development of specific indigenous systems in signalling to avert train collision and to enable real time management of trains, in keeping with the Atamnirbhar Bharat Mission and by maintaining cleanliness standards under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.295 Industry and Infrastructure Figure 32: Traffic and TurnoveTime of major ports in IndiaFigure 33: Relationship between the Traffic volume (RHS) 5.0 10.0 15.0 20.0Average Trunover Time Share of major port in total Traffic Source: Survey calculations based on Ministry of Shipping' s data.

The passenger traffic was 80,857 lakhs in FY20 registering a growth of (-) 4.2 per cent over FY19 (Figure 34 and 35). 8.52 The IR accorded the highest priority to safety and took various measures on a continuous basis to prevent accidents and to enhance safety. As a result, the number of train accidents has come down from 104 in FY17 to 55 in FY20 despite a substantial increase in the traffic volume carried by the Indian Rail ways during the same period (T able 1 1).

The initiative is expected to garner an investment of about ` 30,000 crores from the private sector. Ministry of Railways has identified over 150 pairs of train services for the introduction of 151 modern train sets or rakes through private participation. The private entity shall be responsible for financing, procuring, operating, and maintenance of the trains and shall have the freedom to decide on the fare to be charged from its passengers. The private entities that would undertake the project is being selected through a two-stage competitive bidding process. The bidding process is expected to be completed by May 2021 and the private trains are likely to be introduced in 2023-24. 8.55 The Union Budget 2020-21 made an announcement to run the Kisan Rail services to provide better market opportunity by transporting perishables and agri-product, including milk, meat, and fish. Railways had actively pursued with various stakeholders - including the 297 Industry and Infrastructure Ministry of Agriculture, state governments, and local bodies - to rollout the Kisan Rail services. The Railways has so far operated Kisan Rail services on thirteen routes. T ill 8th January 2021, a total of 120 trips of Kisan Rail have been operated, transporting more than 34,000 tonnes of consignments. 8.56 During the lock-down on account of COVID-19 pandemic, the operations of all passenger- carrying trains was stopped, which shut-down the movement of essential commodities that had been moving by parcel services. To ensure that the supply of essential commodities throughout the country is not disrupted, Indian Railways introduced parcel special train services, including time-tabled parcel special trains. The first time-tabled parcel special train was run by the Indian Railways on 31st March 2020. 8.57 These time-tabled parcel special train services were continued even when passenger- carrying train services got restored. Till 25th December 2020, the Indian Railways have operated 7,267 parcel special trains, out of which 7,014 had been time-tabled services. Approximately 6.6 lakh tonnes of consignments was transported through these services. 8.58 To develop capacity- both infrastructure and rolling stock- ahead of demand, the Ministry of Railways has developed a National Rail Plan (NRP). It aims at developing adequate rail infrastructure by 2030 to cater to the projected traffic requirements up to 2050. NRP has attempted to map the entire transport infrastructure of the country on a common platform. It has also assessed the existing passenger and freight traffic carried on all modes and forecast the growth for the period 2030 to 2050 and then strategize a significant modal shift to rail. The objective is to increase the modal share of rail in freight from the current level of 27 per cent to 45 per cent. Innovative financing has been devised to fund these priority projects. Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC) is mobilizing resources with sufficient moratorium period and projects are being targeted to be completed well before the expiry of the moratorium period. These priority projects are being planned in such a way that they will provide enough return to service the debt. Telecom Sector 8.59 The telecom sector plays an important role in implementation of JAM-trinity (Jandhan Aadhar Mobile) based social sector schemes and other pro-development initiative of the GoI. The sector has been recognized all over the world as a powerful tool for development and poverty reduction. The GoI has laid considerable emphasis on broadband for all as a part of its Digital India Campaign. Efforts are being made to address the digital divide by extending inclusive internet access to every Indian citizen. The details on users and its break-up are summarised in the Figure 36. The wireless telephony constitutes 98.3 per cent of all subscriptions whereas the share of landline telephones now stands at only 1.7 per cent. The overall teledensity in India stands at 86.6 per cent at the end of November-2020, whereas teledensity in rural and urban areas are 59.1 per cent and 139.0 per cent respectively . 8.60 Internet and broadband penetrated both in urban and rural area at a rapid pace. The number of internet subscribers (both broadband and narrowband put together) stood at 776.45 million at the end of September-2020 as compared to 636.73 million in March-2019. The wireless data usage grew at exponential rate during the calender year 2019 and was at 76.47 Exa bytes. During 298 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 January-September 2020, it had already reached 75.21 Exa bytes (Figure 37). Average wireless data consumption per subscriber per month increased from 9.1 GB in March-2019 to 12.2 GB in June-2020 (Figure 38). The reduced cost of data could enable affordable internet access at a rapid pace. As on June-2020, the cost of wireless data stood at `10.55 per GB. 8.61 The GoI has taken various initiatives including BharatNet for achieving the goal of Digital India programme. Under the project, network infrastructure is being established for Broadband Highways, accessible on a non-discriminatory basis to provide affordable broadband services to citizens and institutions in rural areas, in partnership with States and the private sector. As on 15.01.2021 about 4.87 lakh kms of optical fiber cable has been laid to cover 1.63 lakh Gram Panchayats (GPs) and nearly 1.51 lakh GPs have become service ready .

With a share of 5.8 per cent of the world's primary energy consumption, the Indian energy consumption basket is primarily dominated by Coal and Crude Oil. India's indigenous crude oil production declined to 32.17 Million Metric Tonnes (MMT) in FY20 as against 34.20 MMT in FY19. Of the total crude oil & condensate production, 64.1 per cent was from ONGC, 9.7 per cent from OIL, and 26.2 per cent from the Production Share Contract (PSC) regime. During FY21 (Apr-Dec), oil production registered a decline of 5.7 per cent as compared to the corresponding period in FY20 (Figure 39). The decline in production is mainly on account of the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, production is expected to return to normalcy given the economic recovery . 8.63 Natural Gas production during FY20 was 31.18 Billion Cubic Meters (BCM) as against 32.87 BCM in FY19 (Figure 40). Of the total production of natural gas, 76.1 per cent was from ONGC, 8.6 per cent from OIL, and 15.3 per cent from the PSC regime. During April-December 2020, gas production was 21.13 BCM which was 11.3 per cent lower than the production during the same period in FY20.

During FY20, most refineries had planned shutdowns for the implementation of quality upgradation projects. Crude processed during April-December 2020 was 160.36 MMT which is 15.8 per cent lower than crude processed during April-December 2019. Despite this, the Government provided much needed support to poor households by distributing over 14 crore free LPG cylinders, and continued uninterrupted fuel supplies across the country throughout C OVID-19 lockdown. Power 8.65 Electricity is essential for powering economic activity and is also required in leisure time. The power sector has witnessed substantial transformation from both the demand (universal electrification) and supply-side (the advent of green energy). Commendable progress has been made in the generation and transmission of electricity in India. The total installed capacity has increased from 3,56,100 MW in March-2019 to 3,70,106 MW in March 2020. Further, the generation capacity increased to 3,73,436 MW in October-2020 and comprised of 2,31,321 MW 300 Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 of thermal, 45,699 MW of MW of nuclear, and 89,636 MW of renewables and others. The capacity addition in the power sector was mainly driven by the Government in the year FY20 (Figure 41). 8.66 The decline in energy deficit may be partially attributed to enhanced energy efficiency and improved energy intensity in India. Energy intensity is defined as the quantity of energy required to produce a unit of output. Therefore, lower the energy intensity better it is. The ener gy intensity of India (at 2011-12 prices) decreased from 65.6 toes per crore rupees in FY12 to 55.43 toe per crore rupees in FY19 (Figure 42). At the same time, the per capita consumption increased from 0.47 toe in FY12 to 0.58 toe in FY19. 8.67 In 2014, GoI approved the Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) to facilitate state utilities to ensure quality and reliable 24x7 power supply in the urban areas with a total outlay of ` 32,612 crores. So far, projects worth ` 30,991 crores have been sanctioned to the States and the distribution strengthening has been completed in 442 of the 546 circles till the end of September-2020. Further, the country has already accomplished two major landmarks in rural electrification arena: (i) 100 per cent village electrification under Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Joyti Yojana, and in Power (in MW)Figure 42: Energy intensity and Per Energy Intensity (toe per crore , RHS) Source: Survey calculations based on Ministry of Power data.

As compared to the T&D losses of the peer countries, India' s T&D are very high (Figure 43). Mining Sector 8.69 Minerals are valuable natural resources that are finite and play a key role in the overall economic development. The mining sector is one of the core sectors of the economy. India produces as many as 95 minerals which include 4 hydrocarbon energy minerals (coal, lignite, petroleum & natural gas), 5 atomic minerals (ilmenite, rutile, zircon, uranium, and monazite), 10 metallic, 21 non-metallic, and 55 minor minerals. The Gross Value Added (GVA) of the 301 Industry and Infrastructure mining and quarrying sector in FY20 was ` 3,93,102 crores (at current price), accounting for about 2.1 per cent of the overall GVA during FY20. The production value of the major minerals increased by 2.3 per cent in FY20 as compared to 22.4 per cent growth in FY19. The mining sector has undergone significant reforms in recent years, that has resulted in better exploration and utilization of natural resources (Box 9).

Box 9: Policy Initiatives in Mineral Sector Amendments in the Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (MMDR Act) in 2015 heralded major reforms in this sector. The move towards grant of mineral concessions through auction as against the earlier method of 'first-come-first-served' brought in transparency and removed discretion in the grant of mineral concessions. Establishment of the National Mineral Exploration Trust (NMET) for providing impetus to exploration; uniform lease period of 50 years; dispensing of the requirement of previous approval of the Central Government for grant of mineral concession other than for atomic minerals, coal and lignite; establishing district mineral foundation for benefit of people and areas af fected by mining. Recently, the GoI has taken following legislative and policy reform measures: The MMDR Act was amended in January-2020 to provide for, inter-alia , transfer of all valid statutory clearances vested with the old lessee to the new successful bidder up to a period of two years for all brownfield mines, so that there is no disruption in production and supply of raw material in the industry . At present after auction of mines, the successful bidder applies for clearances and after obtaining clearances production starts. Generally, getting clearances takes longer times, anywhere around 3 to 4 years and consequently production is delayed. For immediate start of production after auction, approach adopted in the amended Act is that States need to obtain the clearances be fore auction. As a result, production will start without any delay because clearances are already available. To implement this concept, Ministry of Mines has issued guidelines for pre-embedded302 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 statutory clearances on 03.06.2020 in consultations with MoEFCC and the States. As per guidelines, the States will setup Project Monitoring Units (PMUs), which will in turn obtain clearances before auction of mines and these clearances then will be transferred to successful bidders after auction. Under Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, the GoI announced major initiative on 16.05.2020, which inter alia include: (1) introduction of a seamless composite exploration-cum-mining-cum- production regime; (2) 500 mining blocks to be offered through an open and transparent auction process; (3) joint auction of bauxite and coal mineral blocks; (4) removal of distinction between captive and non-captive mines; (5) Mineral index for different mineral; and (6) rationalization of stamp duty. These structural reforms are aimed to boost growth, employment and to bring state of art technology in the mining sector in general and in exploration in particular . The GoI is in the process of setting up \"Aluminium Import Monitoring System\" (AIMS) & Copper Import Monitoring System (CIMS) to monitor the import of aluminium & copper in the country. The purpose of AIMS & CIMS is to have adequate information about import of aluminium and copper so that an appropriate policy intervention could be devised well in time for creation of capacities within the country under Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan. For the first time, the Gol has approved Schedule of Charges (SoC) applicable for exploration projects funded from NMET which is ef fective from 01.04.2020. Housing and Urban Infrastructure 8.70 India is witnessing rapid urbanisation. According to Census 2011, India's urban population was 37.7 crores, which is projected to grow to about 60 crores by 2030. Urbanization in India has become an important and irreversible process, and it is an important determinant of national economic growth and poverty reduction. Though the cities are engines of growth, a rapid pace of urbanization poses significant challenges to basic infrastructure services such as water supply, sanitation, solid waste and wastewater management. 8.71 The GoI has been implementing the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Urban Livelihoods Mission in all the statutory towns to address the social & occupational vulnerabilities of the urban poor. Under the mission, urban poor are imparted skill training for self and wage employment and assisted in setting up self-employment ventures by providing credit at subsidized rates of interest. The Mission also provides for shelters for urban homeless and infrastructure for street vendors. As on 31st October 2020, ` 3,378 crores have been released to States/UTs and 9.9 lakh beneficiaries have been skill-trained and certified to enhance their employability. Of this, 5.3 lakh skill-trained have been given self and wage-based employment. 8.72 PM Street Vendor 's Atmanirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) was launched as part of the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan for providing micro-credit facility to the street vendors to restart their businesses post COVID-19 lockdowns. This scheme targets to benefit over 50 lakhs street vendors who had been vending on or before March 24, 2020, in urban areas including those from surrounding peri-urban/ rural areas. Under the Scheme, the vendors can avail a working capital loan of up to ` 10,000, which is repayable in monthly instalments in the tenure of one year. On timely/ early repayment of the loan, an interest subsidy @ 7 per cent per annum will 303 Industry and Infrastructure be credited to the bank accounts of beneficiaries through Direct Benefit Transfer on quarterly basis. The Scheme was launched on June 01, 2020 and started its operations from July 2, 2020. As on November 9, 2020, of the 26.48 lakh loan applications received, over 13.70 lakh were sanctioned and over 6.70 lakh were disbursed. Work is on to prepare a socio-economic profile of the street vendors and their families and assess their potential eligibility for various central welfare schemes, to further facilitate the linkages to these schemes. 8.73 Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojan-Urban (PMAY -U) has been rapidly moving towards achieving the vision for providing a pucca house to every household by 2022. It has so far approved more than 109 lakh houses of which over 70 lakh houses have been grounded for construction. More than 41 lakh houses have been completed and delivered. The GoI has made additional outlay of ` 18,000 crore for the year FY21 through budgetary allocation and extra budgetary resources for the scheme under Atmanirbhar Bharat 3.0. Further, a sub scheme Affordable Rental Housing Complexes (ARHCs) under PMAY -U has been initiated to address the needs of the migrant workers for decent rental housing at affordable rate near their work places. 8.74 T o provide impetus to innovative technology for housing construction, the Hon'ble Prime Minister laid foundation stones of Light House Projects (LHPs) on 1st January, 2021. The six LHPs for construction of 6,368 houses involving project cost of ` 790.57 crores are being implemented at six places - Lucknow, Indore, Rajkot, Chennai, Ranchi and Agartala using innovative technologies identified through Global Housing Technology Challenge- India. These LHPs will act as live laboratories for all stakeholders leading to mainstreaming of these global technologies in Indi an context. WAY FORWARD 8.75 The COVID-19 led economic crisis adversely affected the global and domestic economy. The economic activities across the sectors were suddenly suspended that forced billions of people to restrict their movement. The crisis management strategy had to encompass all the stakeholders, especially the weaker and the vulnerable sections. The nature and scale of the unprecedented shock triggered several interventions from the Government -short term as well as those aimed at ushering in structural reforms through the Atmanirbhar Bharat package. A rapid recovery of the industrial sector following a sudden fall in the high frequency growth indicators could only be witnessed because of timely, meaningful, and appropriate policy measures. 8.76 The year after the crisis (FY22) will require sustained and calibrated measures to facilitate the process of economic recovery and to enable the economy to get back to its long-term growth trajectory. The revival of the industrial and infrastructure sector will be key to overall economic growth and macroeconomic stability . 8.77 The FY21 can be summarized in the lines of Saint Francis of Assisi \"Start by doing what' s necessary , then do what' s possible, and suddenly you are doing the impossible\" because as Albert Einstein said, \"In the midst of every crisis, lies great opportunity .\"304 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 CHAPTER AT GLANCE \u00beA strong V-shaped recovery of economic activity further confirmed in the IIP data. The IIP & eight-core index further inched up to pre-COVID levels. \u00beThe broad-based recovery in the IIP resulted in a growth of (-) 1.9 per cent in Nov-20 as compared to a growth of 2.1 per cent in Nov-19 and nadir of (-) 57.3 per cent in Apr -20. \u00beFurther improvement and firming up in industrial activities are foreseen with the Government enhancing capital expenditure as highlighted in the fiscal policy chapter, the vaccination drive and the resolute push forward on long pending reform measures. It is pertinent to point out that the reforms undertaken in the country are probably one of the most comprehensive among the major economies of the world. \u00beThe GoI announced a remedial and reform package (Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan) comprising of stimulus of package amounting to 15 per cent of India' s GDP \u00beAs per the Doing Business Report (DBR), 2020, the rank of India in the Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) Index for 2019 has moved upwards to the 63rd position amongst 190 countries from a rank of 77th in 2018. India has improved its position in 7 out of 10 indicators, inching up to the international best practices. The DBR, 2020 acknowledges India as one of the top 10 improvers, the third time in a row, with an improvement of 67 ranks in three years. It is also the highest jump by any lar ge country since 201 1. \u00beDuring FY20, total FDI equity inflows were US$49.98 billion as compared to US$44.37 billion during FY19. The similar number for FY21 (up to September-2020) was US$30.0 billion. The bulk of FDI equity flow is in the non-manufacturing sector leading to a reduction in the share of manufacturing in the FDI flows. Within the manufacturing sector, industries like automobile, telecommunication, metallur gical, non-conventional energy , chemical (other than fertilizers), food processing, and petroleum & natural gas get the bulk of FDI equity flows. \u00beWith the objective of enhancing India's manufacturing capabilities and exports, the GoI has introduced the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme in the 10 key sectors under the aegis of Atmanirbhar Bharat. The scheme will be implemented by the concerned ministries with an overall expenditure estimated at Rs.1.46 lakh crores and with sector specific financial limits.CHAPTER09 Services The COVID-19 pandemic, the subsequent lockdown and social distancing measures have had a significant impact on the contact-intensive services sector. During the first half of the financial year 2020-21, the services sector contracted by almost 16 per cent. Air passenger traffic, rail freight traffic, port traffic, foreign tourist arrivals, and foreign exchange earnings all contracted sharply following the first lockdown which was announced in March, 2020. As the economy gradually entered the unlock phase, most of these indicators showed signs of recovery. Services purchasing managers' index, rail freight traffic, and port traffic have bottomed out and are rising steadily now, showing a V-shaped recovery. Domestic passenger air traffic is also increasing gradually on a monthly basis, although travel remains muted as compared to last year. Interestingly, in spite of the global disruptions, FDI inflows into the services sector increased by 34 per cent YoY during April-September 2020 to reach US$ 23.61 billion. The year 2020-21 witnessed many significant structural reforms. The space sector was opened up, telecom related regulations were removed from the IT-BPO sector, and consumer protection regulations were introduced for e-commerce. Services sector' s significance in the Indian economy has been steady, with the sector now accounting for over 54 per cent of the economy and almost four-fifths of total FDI inflows. Meanwhile, the shipping turnaround time at ports has almost halved from 4.67 days in 2010-11 to 2.62 days in 2019-20. India is home to 38 unicorns, adding a record number of 12 start-ups to the unicorn list last year. With the ongoing vaccination drive, the contact intensive service sectors can expect to witness revival. SERVICES SECTOR PERFORMANCE IN INDIA: AN OVERVIEW Impact of COVID-19 on Services Sector 9.1 The year 2020 was a peculiar year marred by the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent nationwide and worldwide lockdown measures implemented since March, 2020. The contact intensive services sector was severely impacted, particularly sub-sectors such as tourism, aviation, and hospitality. The first half of FY 2020-21 saw services sector contract by almost 16 per cent YoY (Table 1). This decline was led by a sharp contraction in all sub-sectors particularly 'Trade, hotels, transport, communication & services related to broadcasting', which contracted by 31.5 per cent in H1 FY 2020-21. As per the first advance estimates, Gross Value Added (GV A) of services sector is estimated to contract by 8.8 per cent in 2020-21, whereas it grew by 5.5 per cent in 2019-20 (Table 1). Sub-sectors 'Trade, hotels, transport, communication & broadcasting services', 'Financial, real estate & professional services', and 'Public administration, defence 306 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 & other services' are estimated to contract by 21.41 per cent, 3.68 per cent and 0.82 per cent respectively. It is pertinent to note that while the services sector contracted by over 20 per cent in the first quarter (Q1) of FY 2020-21, the contraction narrowed to 11.4 per cent in the second quarter (Q2) of FY 2020-21. This pace of recovery is broadly aligned with high frequency indicators that point to a pick in economic momentum with the measured opening up of the economy from June 2020.

Note: Shares are in current prices and growth in constant 2011-12 prices; RE: Revised Estimates. PE: Provisional Estimates. AE: Advance Estimates 9.2 India's services sector activity, which had contracted for five consecutive months since March as the Covid-19 pandemic dented demand, has started to pick up since September 2020. The IHS Markit India Services Business Activity Index also known as Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which was at an 85 month high of 57.5 in February, 2020, fell to its lowest level of 5.4 in April, 2020 (Figure 1(a)). As mobility restrictions were lifted and business resumed, Services PMI recovered sharply to 54.1 in October 2020. The index softened to 52.3 in December 2020, although a print above 50 still means expansion. 9.3 Similarly, rail freight traffic growth nosedived to (-) 35.3 per cent YoY in April 2020 before rising back sharply to 15.5 per cent YoY in September 2020, (Figure 1(b)). The growth momentum has continued till December 2020. Indian Railways loading was 118.13 million tonnes in December 2020, which is 8.54 per cent higher YoY compared to last year's loading (108.84 million tonnes) for the same period. It is worth mentioning that a number of concessions/ discounts are also being given in Indian Railways to make Railways Freight movement very attractive. 9.4 Indian airlines were grounded for about two months between March and May, as the government then implemented travel restrictions to curb the spread of the pandemic. Air passenger traffic, thus, fell sharply in April 2020 (Figure 1(c)). Airlines were allowed to resume domestic operations from late May in a calibrated manner. Domestic air passenger traffic has been showing a gradual recovery since August on a monthly basis, although travel remains 307 Services muted as compared to last year. According to Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), 63.54 lakh domestic passengers travelled by air in November, which was 20.54 per cent higher than the passenger traffic in October when 52.71 lakh passengers flew. The domestic air traffic, however, stands 50.93 per cent lower in November 2020 as compared to November 2019, wherein 1.3 crore passengers had flown. 9.5 Bank credit growth YoY to services sector had moderated significantly between September 2018 and December 2019. However, credit growth to the services sector was stronger in 2020, increasing to 8.76 per cent YoY at the end of November 2020 as compared to 4.84 per cent a year ago (Figure 1(d)). This was driven by growth in sub-sectors 'Tourism, Hotels & Restaurants', 'Transport Operators', 'Professional Services' and 'Shipping' contracted by 24.66 per cent and 20.51 per cent YoY respectively (Table 2).

Service sector share at the State and UT level 9.6 The services sector accounts for more than 50 per cent of the Gross State Value Added (GSV A) in 15 out of the 33 states and UTs (Table 3). In eight states, services sector accounts for more than 60 per cent of GSV A. Chandigarh and Delhi stand out with a particularly high share of services in GSV A of over 85 per cent while Sikkim's share remains the lowest at 27.02 per cent. It must be noted that even states with relatively lower share of services in GSV A, such as Tripura, Pradesh have witnessed strong services sector growth in the recent years.

FDI Inflows into Services Sector 9.7 India improved its position from 12th in 2018 to 9th in 2019 in the list of the world's largest FDI recipients according to the latest World Investment Report 2020 by United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). FDI into India recorded almost 17 per cent jump during April-September 2020 over the corresponding period last year, despite the global slowdown, the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown measures and supply chain disruptions. Services sector 1, being the largest recipient of FDI in India, witnessed a strong growth during April-September 2020. The gross FDI equity inflows (excluding re-invested earnings) into the services sector jumped 34 per cent YoY during April-September 2020 to reach US$ 23.61 billion, accounting for almost four-fifth of the total gross FDI equity inflows into India during this period (Table 4). The jump in FDI equity inflows was driven by strong inflows into the 'Computer Software & Hardware' sub-sector, wherein FDI inflows increased to US$ 17.55 billion which is over 336 per cent higher over the corresponding period last year. High growth in FDI inflows was also present in sub-sectors such as 'Retail Trading', 'Agriculture Services', and 'Education'. 1 Estimated as gross FDI equity inflows into financial services, business services, outsourcing, R&D, technology testing & analysis, courier, telecommunications, trading, computer hardware & software, hotels & tourism, hospital & diagnostic centres, consultancy services, sea transport, information & broadcasting, retail trading, agriculture services, education, and air transport.310 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Table 4: Gross FDI Equity Inflows* into Services Sector Services Sub-sectorsShare in Gross FDI Equity Inflows into Services sector in 2019-20 (per cent)**Gross FDI Equity Inflows (US$ million) 2018-19 2019-20April-Sep 2019April-Sep 2020 Financial, Business, Outsourcing, R&D, Courier, Tech Testing & Analysis9.54 9,158 7,854 Broadcasting 0.68 161 Hotel & Tourism 1.20 1,076 2,938 859 283 Hospitals & Diagnostic Centers 0.69 1,045 635 376 163 Education 2.56 777 3,245 216 604 Retail Trading 5.21 443 472 243 1,230 Consultancy Services 0.46 411 1,047 473 110 Sea Transport 0.61 279 199 173 144 Air Transport 0.41 191 918 114 97 Agriculture Services 0.25 88 46 23 60 Gross FDI Equity Inflows into Services Sector (US$ million)28,265 34,868 17,577 23,612 Change from Previous Year (per cent YoY)-2.4 23.4 33.1 34.3 Gross FDI Equity Inflows into India (US$ million)44,366 49,977 26,096 30,004 Share of Services Sector in Equity Inflows (per cent)63.7 69.8 67.4 78.7 Source: Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT). Note: *Excludes re-invested earnings. Trade in Services Sector 9.8 In 2020, the world trade in services was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant supply chain disruptions worldwide. While World Trade Organisation (WTO) projects the global merchandise trade volume growth to fall by 9.2 per cent in 2020, the IMF expects volume of global trade in goods and services to contract by 10.4 per cent in 2020. WTO services trade activity index indicated a decline in global trade in commercial services of 4.3 per cent in the first three months of 2020, reflecting partly the adverse effect from spread of COVID-19. During Q2 of 2020 (April-June), the global trade in commercial services plunged by 30 per cent YoY as several countries imposed lockdown and transportation restrictions that covered cross-border measures as well. 9.9 India has a significant presence in the services sector exports. It remained among the top ten trading countries in commercial services in 2019 accounting for 3.5 per cent of world services 311 Services exports. Notwithstanding the setback witnessed in the wake of the pandemic, India's services sector remained relatively resilient when compared to merchandise trade. The sector provided steady flow of current receipts even though exports from a few sub-sectors were adversely affected. Net services export receipts amounted to US$ 41.67 billion in H1 of FY2020-21 as compared with US$ 40.47 billion a year ago. 9.10 India's services export growth moderated to 2.5 per cent in 2019-20 from 6.6 per cent in 2018-19 as receipts primarily on account of transportation, insurance and communication services. With contraction in global demand and implementation of COVID-19 induced lockdown measures, services exports declined by 7.87 per cent in H1 of FY2020-21 as against a growth of 6.39 per cent in the corresponding period of previous year (T able 5).

Slowdown in trade activity and supply chain disruptions led to the decline in transportation receipts by 2.34 per cent in H1 of FY2020-21 as against a growth of 10.77 per cent in H1 of FY2019-20. Software exports, with a share of 49.3 per cent in total services exports, however, remained resilient with higher demand for digital support, cloud services and infrastructure modernisation catering to the new challenges posed by the pandemic. In fact, majority of software companies which had reported negative revenue growth in Q1 of FY2020-21, have shown signs of rebound in Q2 with positive sequential growth on account of the increased revenue from their financial, banking and insurance, retail, life sciences and health care units. 9.12 As projected by Gartner (October 2020), although the global IT spending is expected to decline by 5.4 per cent in 2020, it will rebound with the onset of recovery phase in 2021. Among other major sectors, business services exports recorded a growth of 2.48 per cent in H1 of 2020-21. 9.13 India's services imports exhibited sharper decline of 13.95 per cent in H1 of FY2020- 21 in comparison with services exports. Payments for all major services imports decreased on YoY basis. Among the major sectors, payments for overseas travel fell by 55.09 per cent due to restrictions on outbound travel from India. Payments for transport services (accounting for over 16 per cent share in total services imports) recorded a decline of 25.9 per cent in H1 of FY2020-21 on a year-on-year basis. Payment for imports of business services, which accounted for 43.41 per cent of total services imports, increased by 4.22 per cent in H1 of 2020-21 (Table 5). 9.14 Sharper decline in services imports over exports led to an increase in net services receipts by 2.1 per cent in Q1 of 2020-21 over the previous year. Sharp contraction in merchandise trade deficit and a stable net services receipts led to a current account surplus of 3.9 per cent of GDP in Q1 of 2020-21. According to the World Trade Organization (WTO), though the world services trade declined by 4.3 per cent (YoY) in Q1 of 2020 2 (January-March), key sectors have started showing signs of rebound. The provisional data on India's trade in services in Q2 of 2020-21 is showing signs of revival with exports increasing by 8.4 per cent QoQ and imports increasing by 13.2 per cent Q-o-Q; resulting in improvement of 2.3 per cent QoQ in net services exports. Even though projections of world trade volume of goods and services are optimistic for 2021, duration and containment of the pandemic and effectiveness of government policy responses to revive the economy would be key factors in shaping India's services trade. MAJOR SERVICES: SUB-SECTOR WISE PERFORMANCE AND RECENT POLICIES 9.15 In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, most of the sub-sectors of the services sector witnessed a contraction in growth during 2020-21 (Table 6). Aviation and tourism declined sharply in 2020. Only 2.46 million foreign tourist arrived in India during January-June 2020 as compared to 5.29 million during January-June last year. Consequently, foreign exchange earnings from tourism declined to US$ 6.16 billion during the first six months of 2020 as 2 Services Trade Activity Index, World Trade Barometers, WTO, September 17, 2020.313 Services compared to US$ 14.19 billion during in corresponding period last year. Domestic passenger traffic too dropped to 22.77 million during April-November 2020 from 95.7 million during the corresponding period last year. In the ports sector, Cargo traffic at ports fell by 10.09 per cent to 777.04 million tonnes (MT) during April-November period of the current fiscal compared to 864.32 MT during April-November 2019. This section discusses developments in some key sub-sectors of the services sector in detail.

E = Expected.314 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Tourism Sector 9.16 Tourism sector is a major engine of economic growth that contributes significantly in terms of GDP, foreign exchange earnings and employment. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a debilitating impact on world travel and tourism, including India. As per the World Tourism Barometer of the United Nation's World Tourism Organization (December, 2020 edition), international arrivals fell by 72 per cent globally over the first ten months of 2020, with restrictions on travel, low consumer confidence and a global struggle to contain the COVID-19 virus, all contributing to the worst year on record in the history of tourism. World destinations received 900 million fewer international tourists between January-October when compared with the same period of 2019, translating into a loss of US$ 935 billion in export revenues from international tourism. Note that International Tourist Arrivals (ITA) had reached a total of 1.5 billion in 2019. 9.17 Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), to contain the spread of the virus, had suspended all commercial international flights in March 2020. The ban has been extended till January 2021. In order to evacuate Indians stranded abroad after the breakout of the Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdowns across the world, Vande Bharat Mission was launched in early May. Under this Mission, which is currently in its ninth phase, the government established Transport Bubbles 3 with countries to repatriate its citizens. At present, India has active air bubbles with 24 countries. As of January 5, 2021, over 4.49 million people were facilitated international travel through different air ever since the Vande Bharat Mission was launched. 9.18 The tourism sector in India had been performing well with Foreign Tourist Arrivals (FTAs) growing at 14 per cent to 10.04 million and Foreign Exchange Earnings (FEEs) at 19.1 per cent to US$ 27.31 billion in 2017. However, the sector underwent a slowdown in 2018 and 2019 before declining sharply in 2020 (Figure 2(a&b)). The Foreign Tourist Arrivals (FTAs) in 2019 stood at 10.93 million compared to 10.56 million in 2018. In terms of growth, the growth rate of FTAs declined from 14 per cent in 2017 to 5.2 per cent in 2018 and further to 3.5 per cent in 2019. Foreign Exchange Earnings (FEEs) from tourism stood at US$ 30.06 billion in 2019 as compared to US$ 28.59 billion in 2018. In terms of growth, the FEEs declined from 19.1 per cent in 2017 to 4.7 per cent in 2018, picking up slightly to 5.1 per cent in 2019. 9.19 India ranked 23rd in the world in terms of international tourist arrivals in 2019, falling slightly from the 22nd position in 2018. The country accounts for 1.23 per cent of world's international tourist arrivals and 4.97 per cent of Asia & Pacific's international tourist arrivals (Table 7). India ranks 12th in the world and 7th in Asia & Pacific in terms of tourism foreign exchange earnings, accounting for over 2 per cent of the world's tourism foreign exchange earnings. 3\"Transport Bubbles\" or \"Air Travel Arrangements\" are temporary arrangements between two countries aimed at restarting commercial passenger services when regular international flights are suspended as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. They are reciprocal in nature, meaning airlines from both countries enjoy similar benefits.315 Services Table 7: Foreign and International Tourist Arrivals and Tourism Receipts in India and the World Parameter 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Foreign Tourist Arrivals (FTA) to India (million)8.03 8.80 10.04 10.56 10.93 International 16.81 17.42 1.26 1.24 1.23 India's Rank in World's ITAs 24 th 26th 26th22nd23rd ITAs (million) Asia Pacific's ITAs 7 th8th7th7th7th India's Share World Tourism Receipts (per cent)1.73 1.84 2.02 1.97# 2.03 # Foreign Exchange $ billion)21.01 22.92 27.31 28.59 30.06 India's Rank in World Tourism 14 th 13th 13th13th#12th# India's Share in Asia Source: Ministry of Tourism.

They accounted for 67 per cent of the total foreign tourist arrivals in India in 2019. Among the foreign tourists, 57.1 per cent tourists visited for leisure, holiday and recreation, 14.7 per cent for business purposes, and 12.7 per cent was Indian diaspora. 9.21 Looking at tourism trends at the state level, the top five states attracting domestic tourists are Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharashtra, accounting for nearly 71 per cent of the total domestic tourist visits in the country in 2019. The top five states attracting foreign tourists are Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and West Bengal, accounting for 69.4 per cent of the total foreign tourist visits in the country in 2019. 9.22 To facilitate international tourism, India introduced the e-Tourist Visa regime in September 2014 for 46 countries. Prior to the launch of the scheme, the e-Visa facility was available for only 12 countries. The government further liberalized the visa regime in 2016, renaming it to e-Visa scheme with e-Visa scheme is now available for 169 countries with valid entry through 28 designated airports and 5 designated seaports. With this, foreign tourist arrivals to India on e-visas have increased from 4.45 lakh in 2015 to 29.28 lakh in 2019 and stood at 8.37 lakh in January-March 2020. 9.23 India ranked 34th in Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index, improving significantly from its rank of 65 in 2013. Tourism contributed 5 per cent share to India's total GDP in 2018-19. It also supports almost 13 per cent of total employment in India. With the ongoing vaccination drive, the contact intensive service sectors can expect to witness revival. IT BPM Services 9.24 The Indian IT-BPM Industry has been the flag-bearer of India's exports over the last 20 years. While 1999-2000 to 2009-10 was a decade of growth, the last decade has been that of consolidation and the industry succeeded in decoupling revenue and employee growth. Over the last decade, the industry grew by 102 per cent reaching US$ 190.5 billion in revenues in 2019-20. It also added 1.8 million employees, up 70 per cent over the last 10 years. However, the business model has changed over the years. Chart 1 traces the evolution of the business model for IT and IT enabled services over the past two decades. Chart 1: Evolution of the business model for IT-ITeS Source: NASSCOM317 Services 9.25 Over the last six years, IT services has constituted the majority share (over 50 per cent) of the IT-BPM sector (Figure 3), with about US$ 97 billion in revenues in 2019-20. Software & Engineering Services has witnessed a consistent growth each year, constituting a share of 21 per cent in the sector and US$ 40.2 billion in revenue in 2019-20. BPM Services has maintained its share at 19.8 per cent, while the Hardware services has been declining in share each year but maintaining growth in revenues. Figure 3: Sub-Sector Breakdown of IT-BPM Sector Note: E: Estimate. 9.26 A significant part (about 84 per cent) of the IT-BPM industry (excluding hardware and e-commerce) continues to be export driven, with export revenues in excess of US$ 146 billion in 2019-20 (Table 8). During 2019-20, the revenue growth for IT-BPM sector (excluding hardware and e-commerce) made a recovery to reach 7.9 per cent up from 6.8 per cent in 2018-19. This was driven primarily by a significant boost in domestic revenue growth (6.6 per cent in 2019-20 from -0.3 per cent in 2018-19). Table 8: Exports and Domestic Market Size of Indian IT-BPM Industry (Excluding Hardware & E-Commerce) USD billion Per cent (YoY) Year Domestic Exports Total Domestic Exports Total 2015-16 129.41 3.2 9.27 Out of the total US$ 146.55 billion in exports of the IT-BPM sector in 2019-20, IT services contributed US$ 79.1 billion, accounting for 54 per cent of the exports. BPM and Software Products & Engineering services accounted for the remaining 46 per cent with 318 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 each accounting for a roughly equal share of about 23 per cent. (Figure 4). All three sub- sectors witnessed an increase in export revenues in 2019-20, with IT services growing by 6.9 per cent, BPM services by 8.4 per cent and Software Products & Engineering Services by 10.7 per cent. Figure 4: Sub-Sector Breakdown of IT-BPM Exports (US $ billion) (Excluding Hardware and e-commerce) Source: NASSCOM. Note: E: Estimate. 9.28 Looking at country-wise distribution of export revenues, USA remained the biggest recipient of exports, amounting to US$ 91 billion (Figure 5), accounting for 62 per cent of total IT-BPM exports (excluding hardware) in 2019-20. This is followed by UK, being the second largest export market for IT-BPM services amounting US$ 24.7 billion but with a much smaller share of around 17 per cent. Europe (excluding UK) and Asia-Pacific account for 11.4 per cent and 7.6 per cent of the export earnings of India, respectively. Figure 5: Geographic Break-up of India's IT-BPM Exports (US $ billion) (Excluding Hardware and e-commerce) Source: NASSCOM. Note: E: Estimate.319 Services 9.29 In 2021, a number of significant structural reforms have been undertaken to drive innovation, technology adoption and efficiency in the IT-BPM sector, including Relaxation of OSP Terms & Conditions, and Consumer Protection (E-commerce) Rules, 2020. This would significantly expand access to talent, increase job creation, make India a global hub for digital services and catapult the sector to the next level of growth and innovation (See Box 1 for more details). 9.30 The Indian start-up ecosystem has been progressing well, despite the Covid-19 pandemic. Faced with a myriad of challenges at the onset of the pandemic, the ecosystem defied the odds and had a record number of 12 start-ups that reached unicorn status. The country is home to 38 unicorns at present, as per the Nasscom Tech Start up Report 2021. The US and China have 243 and 227 unicorns, respectively. Box 1: Major policy initiatives and reforms in IT-BPM Sector Relaxation of OSP Terms & Conditions: With an aim to improve the Ease of Doing Business of the IT Industry particularly Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) and IT Enabled Services, the Government, in November 2020, simplified the Other Service Provider (OSP) guidelines of the Department of Telecom. The new guidelines tremendously reduce the compliance burden of the BPO industry and enables to 'Work from Home' (WFH). In effect, the registration requirements of Other Service Providers (OSPs) were done away with altogether and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) services engaged in data related operations have been taken out of the ambit of OSP. In addition, other requirements such as deposit of bank guarantees, requirement for static IPs, frequent reporting obligations, publication of network diagram, penal provisions etc. have also been removed. These changes will enable IT-BPM companies to 'Work from Home' and 'Work from Anywhere'. Additional dispensations to enhance flexibility for the Industry have been allowed. Consumer Protection Act, 2019: The Act came in to force on 20th July 2020 empowering consumers and to protect their rights through its various notified rules and provisions such as Consumer Protection Councils, Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions, Mediation, Product Liability and punishment for manufacture or sale of products containing adulterant / spurious goods. The Act includes establishment of the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) to promote, protect and enforce the rights of consumers. Moreover, every e-commerce entity is required to provide information relating to return, refund, exchange, warranty/guarantee, delivery, modes of payment, grievance redressal, payments, charge-back options, etc. including country of origin which are necessary for enabling the consumer to make an informed decision at the pre-purchase stage on its platform. Further , the New Act introduces the concept of product liability and brings within its scope, the product manufacturer, product service provider and product seller, for any claim for compensation. The Department of Consumer Affairs (DoCA) published the Consumer Protection (E-commerce) Rules, 2020 in July 2020. 320 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Ports, Shipping and Waterways Services 9.31 Ports handle around 90 per cent of export-import cargo by volume and 70 per cent by value in India. The total cargo capacity of major ports which was 871.52 Million Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA) at the end of March 2014 has increased to 1,534.91 MTPA by the end of March 2020 and handled traffic of 704.92 MT during 2019-20. Ports including Deendayal (Kandla), Paradip, JNPT, Vishakhapatnam, and Chennai had the highest cargo capacities as of March 2020. India has a 1 per cent share in world fleet as on January 2020. The total numbers of ships owned by Indian companies stood at 1,431 in 2019-20, up from 1,210 in 2014-15. 9.32 A consistent growth of around 6 per cent was maintained in overall port traffic between 2015-16 and 2018-19. It decelerated to 1.98 per cent in 2019-20 before falling sharply in 2020 owning to the lockdown in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 6(a)). Cargo traffic growth contracted considerably between April to June 2020, however is now showing signs of pick up. Infact, cargo traffic growth has turned positive since September 2020, Figure 6(b). Figure 6 (a): Annual Growth (YoY) in Port TrafficFigure 6 (b): Monthly Growth (YoY) in Port Traffic Source: Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways 9.33 The turnaround time of ships, which is a key indicator of efficiency of the ports sector, has declined from 4 days in 2014-15 to 2.62 days in 2020-21 (April-September). The shipping turnaround time has declined across all major ports and is now the lowest at the Cochin port and the highest at the Mormugao port (Table 9). It must be noted that among all the major ports, Paradip port has shown biggest improvement in reducing average turnaround time of ships from over 7 days in 2014-15 to less than 3 days in 2020-21(April-September). As per the latest UNCTAD data, the median ship turnaround time globally is 0.97 days, suggesting that India has room to further improve upon the efficiency at ports.321 Services Table 9: Average Ships' Turnaround Time at Major Indian Ports 1.98 2.00 V 2.35 2.04 1.93 1.91 2.05 Mormugao 4.15 3.65 4.51 2.63 2.63 2.48 2.59 2.62 Source: Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways 9.34 To harness the coastline, 14,500 km of potentially navigable waterways and strategic location on key international maritime trade routes, the Government has embarked on the ambitious Sagarmala Programme to promote port-led development in the country. The vision of the Programme is to reduce logistics cost of Exports-Imports and domestic trade with minimal infrastructure investment. This includes reducing the cost of transporting domestic cargo; lowering logistical cost of bulk commodities by locating future industrial capacities near the coast; improving export competitiveness by developing port proximate discrete manufacturing clusters, etc. The Sagarmala programme has identified 504 projects under four pillars - 211 port modernization projects, 199 port connectivity projects, 32 port-led industrialization projects and 62 coastal community development projects which can unlock the opportunities for port-led development and are expected to mobilize more than ` 3.57 Lakh Crore of infrastructure investment. Between July 2019 - October 2020, 20 Sagarmala projects worth ` 4,543 crore have been completed which comprise 9 projects of Port Modernization worth ` 1,405 crore, 7 Port Connectivity projects worth ` 2,799 crore and 4 Coastal Community Development projects worth ` 339 crore.322 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Space Sector 9.35 India's space programme has grown exponentially in the past six decades, expanding from simple mapping services in the 1960s to many diversified uses including- design and development of a series of launch vehicles and related technologies, satellites and related technologies for earth observation, telecommunication & broadband, navigation, meteorology and space science, R&D in space sciences, & most recently, planetary exploration. 9.36 India spent about US$ 1.8 billion on space programmes in 2019-20. However, the country still lags behind the major players in the space sector, such as USA, which spent about 10 times more than India in the space sector in 2019-20 (Figure 7), and China, which spent about 6 times more. 9.37 India has launched around 5-7 satellites per year in the recent years. On the other hand, USA, Russia and China dominate the satellite launching services with 19, 25 and 34 satellites respectively in 2019 (Table 10).

Box 2: Prospects for commercialization and attracting private investment in the space sector India's space programme is one of the most well-developed in the world and has achieved numerous successes through its state-owned agency, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) which is responsible for driving the space activities in India. With the long term vision of making the country self-reliant and technologically advanced, the Government in June 2020, opened up the Space sector enabling the participation of Indian private sector in the entire gamut of space activities. New Space India Limited (NSIL), a Central Public Sector Enterprise under Department of Space, has been mandated to transfer the technologies emanating out of Indian space programme and enable Indian industry to scale up high-technology manufacturing base. Government of India has also established Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) for promoting industries and attracting investment in space sector. Further, ISRO would be sharing its infrastructure, transfer technology know-how for production and spin-off. These measures would help India become a manufacturing hub of space assets. As per industry estimates, there are more than 40 start-ups working in India with funding, teams and structure on space and satellite projects complimenting the efforts of government. This number is likely to increase in coming years with technology to play a big role. The recent reforms announced by Government of India for unlocking the space potential of India stresses the need to enable the private industry to be the co-traveller in India's space journey. As per Satellite Industry Association Report (2020), the global space economy in 2019 was pegged at US$ 366 billion, growing by about 1.7 per cent over 2018. The commercial satellite industry is accounting for nearly 75 per cent of global space business. Technology innovations and demand drives the need for higher bandwidth capacity, throughput speeds, improved optical, radar and thermal imaging. PwC estimates that the Indian space economy is valued at US$ 7 billion, which is around 2 per cent of the global space economy .324 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 CHAPTER AT A GLANCE India's Services sector witnessed a significant set-back during the COVID-19 pandemic mandated lockdown. Owing to its contact-intensive nature, the sector contracted by nearly 16 per cent during the first half of the financial year 2020-21. Air passenger traffic, rail freight traffic, port traffic, foreign tourist arrivals, and foreign exchange all contracted sharply as soon as the first lockdown was announced in March 2020. However, there are now signs of steady recovery. Despite the disruptions being witnessed globally, FDI inflows into India's services sector grew robustly by 34 percent YoY during April-September 2020 to reach US$ 23.6 billion. The year 2020-21 witnessed many significant structural reforms. Telecom related regulations were removed from the IT-BPO sector, and consumer protection regulations were introduced for e-commerce. The shipping turnaround time at ports has almost halved from 4.67 days in 2010-11 to 2.62 days in 2019-20. As per the latest UNCTAD data, the median ship turnaround time globally is 0.97 days, suggesting that India has room to further improve upon the efficiency at ports. The Indian start-up ecosystem has been progressing well amidst the Covid-19 pandemic. India is home to 38 unicorns, adding a record number of 12 start-ups to the unicorn list last year. India's space sector has grown exponentially in the past six decades. India spent about US$ 1.8 billion on space programmes in 2019-20. However, the country still lags behind major players in the sector, such as USA, China and Russia. The Indian Space ecosystem is undergoing several policy reforms to engage private players and attract innovation and investment. CHAPTER10 Year 2020 began with the once-in-a-century pandemic, which saw the frontline health workers working tirelessly to save human lives from COVID-19. While the pandemic caused its ripples on the economy and on the social sector, Governments at the Centre and States intervened in a timely manner to respond to the pandemic. India has one of the lowest case fatality rates of less than 1.5 per cent. Also, as shown in Chapter 1 Volume I of the Economic Survey, India has been able to save lakhs of lives through its effective policy response. Public spending on social sector was increased in 2020-21 to mitigate the hardships caused by the pandemic and the loss to livelihood due to the lockdown. During the lockdown, online schooling took off in a big way and the Government introduced several measures to make online education accessible to all children. Similarly the lockdown period also saw the growth of the gig economy and increasing work from home in the organized sector. As per the PLFS report 2018-19, there was an increase in workforce totalling 48.78 crore during 2018-19 as compared to 47.14 crore during 2017- 18. The size of the workforce increased by about 1.64 crore, of which 1.22 crore were in rural sector and 0.42 crore in urban sector. The gender composition was 0.92 crore females and 0.72 crore males. Number of unemployed persons declined by about 0.79 crore between 2017-18 and 2018-19, largely in the category of females, and in rural sector. The females labour force participation rate increased from 17.5 per cent in 2017-18 to 18.6 per cent in 2018-19. These facts reveal that 2018-19 was a good year for employment generation. The net payroll data of Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) as on 20th December, 2020 shows a net increase of new subscribers in EPFO of 78.58 lakhs in 2019-20 as compared to 61.1 lakhs in 2018-19.The quarterly PLFS, which covers the urban areas, shows improvements in the employment situation in Q4-2020 when compared to Q4-2019. Considering the proportion of the male workforce (15 years & above) by status of employment, casual labour decreased by 1 percentage points while self-employed and salaried workers increased by 0.6 percentage points and 0.4 percentage points, respectively. Similarly, in case of the female workforce (15 years & above), self-employed increased by 2 percentage points, regular/wage salaried workers decreased by 0.7 percentage points and casual labour decreased by 1.4 percentage points. The Time Use Survey, 2019 reported that females spend relatively more time in unpaid domestic and care giving activities (7.5 hours) as compared to employment related activities (5.7 hours) per day. This is reported to be one of the main reasons for the low female participation in Social Infrastructure, Employment and Human Development326 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 INTRODUCTION 10.1 The COVID-19 has brought into focus the vulnerabilities of societies, states and countries in facing a pandemic. India imposed a complete lockdown of the economy from 24th March, to 31st May 2020, which helped in arresting the number of fatalities due to COVID-19 as well as taking precautionary measures to contain the spread of the disease and it has helped India to save lakhs of lives. However, the lockdown had an inevitable impact on the vulnerable and informal sector, the education system, and on the economy as a whole. The Government announced the first relief package of ` 1.70 lakh crores under 'Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY)' in March, 2020 and comprehensive stimulus cum relief package of ` 20 lakh crore under 'Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan' in May, 2020. Development and welfare schemes being implemented by the Government over the years together with these relief measures enabled the country to endure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and led to a V-shaped economic recovery (Chapter 1 of V olume I). TRENDS IN SOCIAL SECTOR EXPENDITURE 10.2 The expenditure on social services (education, health and other social sectors) by Centre and States combined as a proportion of GDP increased from 6.2 to 8.8 per cent during the period 2014-15 to 2020-21 (BE). This increase was witnessed across all social sectors. For education, it increased from 2.8 per cent in 2014-15 to 3.5 per cent and for health, from 1.2 per cent to 1.5 per cent during the same period. Relative importance of social services in government budget, as measured in terms of the share of expenditure on social services out of total budgetary expenditure, has also increased to 26.5 per cent in 2020-21 (BE) from 23.4 per cent in 2014-15 (Table 1).the labour market. In the health sector, strengthening of health infrastructure and efficiency in health care delivery was reflected in the outcomes of NFHS-5 with infant mortality rate and under-five mortality rate showing a decline in most of the selected States in NFHS-5 as compared to NFHS-4. As shown in the Chapter 9 of Volume I, this reduction resulted from the roll out of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana under Ayushman Bharat. Allocation for the health sector has flowed towards special requirements in the fight against COVID-19 to ensure essential medicines, hand sanitizers, protective equipment including masks, PPE Kits, ventilators and adequate testing and treatment facilities as well as in vaccinating the population. In 2020-21, to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 induced restrictions on loss of livelihood, the Government has taken various measures such as giving incentive to boost employment under the scheme Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan for migrant workers in the destinations States and has also notified path-breaking labour reforms to attract big investment in the economy.327 Social Infrastructure, Employment and Human Development Table 1: Trends in Social Service Sector Expenditure by General Government (Combined Centre and States) Item 2014-15 2015-16 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 3.51 iii) Others 2.65 3.48 3.93 4.13 4.86 6.06 6.90 As percentage to GDP Expenditure on Social Services6.2 6.6 6.8 6.7 6.7 7.5 8.8 of which: i) Education 2.8 2.8 2.8 2.8 2.8 3.0 3.5 ii) Health 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.5 1.8 iii) Others 2.1 2.5 2.6 2.4 2.6 3.0 3.5 As percentage to total expenditure Expenditure on Social Services23.4 24.3 24.4 25.2 25.4 26.1 26.5 of which: i) Education 10.8 10.4 10.2 10.7 10.4 10.4 10.4 ii) Health 4.5 4.7 5.0 5.4 5.3 5.3 5.4 iii) Others 8.1 9.3 9.2 9.1 9.6 10.3 10.7 As percentage to social services i) Education 46.1 42.8 41.8 42.4 41.2 40.0 39.3 ii) Health 21.4 20.4 20.5 iii) Others 34.6 38.0 37.7 36.2 38.0 39.6 40.2 Source: Budget Documents of Union and State Governments, Reserve Bank of India Note: 1.

A special economic and comprehensive package of ` 20 lakh crore - equivalent to 10 per cent of India's GDP was announced in May 2020. In subsequent announcements, additional support cumulating to ` 29.88 lakh crore up to November 2020 was announced. Of these, provision for ` 4.31 lakh crore made for social sector includes PMGKY and PMGKY Anna Yojana, housing and health (including R & D Grant for COVID-19 Suraksha), EPF support to worker & employers, street vendors, MGNREGS workers and ABRY etc. HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 10.4 India's rank in Human Development Index (HDI)1 was 131 in 2019, compared to 129 in 2018, out of a total 189 countries according to UNDP Human Development Report, 2020. It may be mentioned that the decline in HDI ranking by two points in 2019 as compared to 2018 is relative to other countries. By looking at the sub-component wise performance of HDI indicators, India's 'GNI per capita (2017 PPP $)' has increased from US$ 6,427 in 2018 to US$ 6,681 in 2019, and 'life expectancy at birth' has improved from 69.4 years in 2018 to 69.7 years in 2019, respectively. However, the 'mean years of schooling' and 'expected years of schooling' remained unchanged in 2019 compared to 2018. However, considering the value of Planetary pressures adjusted HDI (PHDI) 2, India was positioned 8 ranks better than HDI rank. If a country puts no pressure on the planet, its PHDI and HDI would be equal, but the PHDI falls below the HDI as pressure rises. PHDI values are very close to HDI values for countries with an HDI value of 0.7 or lower. (Table 2). Table 2: Trends in India's HDI Value and its Sub-components Year 1990 2000 2005 2010 2015 2017 2018 2019 Life expectancy at birth 57.9 62.5 64.5 66.7 68.6 69.2 69.4 69.7 Expected years of schoolingb7.6 8.3 9.7 10.8 12.0 12.3 12.2 12.2 Mean years of schoolingb3.0 4.4 4.8 5.4 6.2 6.5 6.5 6.5 Note: aGNI (Gross national income) is based on 2017 dollar purchasing power parity (PPP), bData refers to 2019 or the most recent year available. 10.5 The value of HDI for India has increased from 0.579 in 2010 to 0.645 in 2019. The average annual HDI growth during 2010-2019 was 1.21 per cent as compared to 1.58 per cent during the period 2000-2010. Cross country comparison of average annual HDI growth shows India is ahead of BRICS countries (Figure 1). To sustain this momentum, and overcome possible fallouts of COVID-19 on human development, the thrust on access to social services such as education and health is critical. 1The Human Development Report (HDR) published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) estimates the human development index (HDI) in terms of three basic parameters: to live a long and healthy life, to be educated and knowledgeable, and to enjoy a decent economic standard of living. 2The adjustment factor for PHDI is calculated as the arithmetic mean of indices measuring carbon dioxide emis- sions per capita and material footprint per capita.329 Social Infrastructure, Employment and Human Development Figure 1: Average Annual HDI Growth Rate (per cent), 2010-2019Fig 1 1.41 1.39 1.21 0.95 0.94 0.12 0.000.200.400.600.801.001.201.401.60 Source: Human Development Report, 2020, UNDP QUALITY EDUCATION FOR ALL 10.6 India will have the highest population of young people in the world over the next decade. So, our abilit y to provide high-quality educational opportunities to them will determine the future of our country (National Education Policy, 2020). The progress in school and higher education infrastructure and gross enrolment at all levels is given in Table 3. As per U-DISE+ 2018-193, the physical infrastructure of more than 9.72 lakh government elementary schools has improved significantly. Out of these, 90.2 per cent have girls' toilet, 93.7 per cent have boys' toilet, 95.9 per cent have provision of drinking water facility, 88.1 per cent have hand wash facility, 82.1 per cent have wash (drinking water, toilet and hand wash) facility, 84.2 per cent have medical check-up facility, 20.7 per cent have computer and 67.4 per cent have electricity connection, 74.2 per cent have ramps, 56.5 per cent have boundary wall, 69.3 per cent have playground, 83.8 per cent have library, 21.5 per cent have kitchen garden and 13.9 per cent have rainwater harvesting structure, 23.6 per cent have facility for testing of water and 14.8 per cent have incinerator.

As per National Sample Survey (NSS), the literacy rate of persons of age 7 years and above at the All India level stood at 77.7 per cent but the differences in literacy rate attainment among social-religious groups, as well as gender still persists (Table 4). Female literacy remained below national average among social groups of SC, ST, OBC, including religious groups of Hinduism and Islam.

Children in the age-group of 6-13 years have reported almost 95 per cent and above attendance across States (Table 5). But the attendance rate in the early childhood education, which the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020 emphasises on is low and diverging irrespective of the achievement in education status of the States concerned. While Punjab reported a high attendance rate of 61.6 per cent of the children in the age groups of 3-5 years (i.e. early childhood education), Karnataka reports the lowest attendance rate of only 18.3 per cent. In the 14-17 years age group, which covers the secondary and higher secondary education level, the attendance rates are low as compared to national average in Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Assam, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. In the 18-23 years age bracket, which comprises students pursuing higher education, Kerala and the hilly States have reported higher attendance compared to rest of India. 10.9 The efforts made by the Government to provide quality education in schools and institutions of the government in affordable and competitive manner are given in Box 1. The government announced the new National Education Policy, 2020 replacing the 34 year old National Policy on Education, 1986. The new policy aims to pave the way for transformational reforms in school and higher education systems in the country (Box 2). It aims to provide all students, irrespective of thei r place of residence, quality education system with special focus on the marginalised, disadvantaged and underrepresented groups. Box 1: Programmes and Schemes for School Education during 2020-21 Samagra Shiksha, an overarching programme for the school education sector extending from pre- school to class 12, is being implemented with the broader goal of improving school effectiveness measured in terms of equal opportunities for schooling and equitable learning outcomes. The vision of the Scheme is to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education from pre-school to senior secondary stage in accordance with the SDG for Education. The main outcomes of the Scheme are envisaged as Universal Access, Equity and Quality including V ocational Education, Inclusive Education, increased use of Technology and strengthening of Teacher Education Institutions (TEIs).

Focus on Skill Development: V ocational education for Class 9-12 as integrated with the curriculum and to be made more practical and industry oriented. Focus on Sports and Physical Education Sports Education to be an integral part of curriculum and every school will receive sports equipment's at the cost of ` 5000 to ` 25,000 to inculcate and emphasize relevance of sports. Focus on Regional Balance: Promote Balanced Educational Development Preference to Educationally Backward Blocks (EBBs), LWE affected districts, Special Focus Districts (SFDs), Border areas and the 115 aspirational districts identified by NITI Aayog Under the Samagra Shiksha scheme, a National Mission to improve learning outcomes at the elementary level through an Integrated Teacher Training Programme called NISHTHA (National Initiative for School Heads' and Teachers' Holistic Advancement) was contextualized and made 100 per cent online according to the needs of teaching and learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.333 Social Infrastructure, Employment and Human Development Padhna Likhna Abhiyan: An adult education scheme has been introduced in FY 2020-21 with financial outlay of ` 142.61 crore with a target to make 57 lakh learners' literate. During 2019-20, the Mid-Day Meal (MDM) Programme in schools covered 11.59 crore children enrolled in elementary classes (I-VIII) in 11.34 lakh eligible schools. During COVID-19 pandemic, it was decided to provide food grains and pulses, oil etc., (equivalent to cooking cost) as a one-time special measure to eligible children during the summer vacations. Box 2: National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 Universalization of education from pre-school to secondary level with 100 per cent Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in school education by 2030. To bring ` 2 crore out of school children back into the mainstream through universalization of access and expanding the open schooling system. The current 10+2 system to be replaced by a new 5+3+3+4 curricular structure corresponding to ages 3-8, 8-1 1, 11-14, and 14-18 years, respectively Class 10 and 12 board examinations to be made easier to test core competencies rather than memorized facts. School governance is set to change, with a new standards framework based on online self- declaration in the public domain for both public and private schools. Emphasis on foundational literacy and numeracy, and no rigid separation between academic streams, extra-curricular, vocational streams in schools. V ocational Education to start from Class 6 with Internships. Teaching up to at least Grade 5 to be in mother tongue/regional language, wherever possible. No language will be imposed on any student. Assessment reforms with 360-degree Holistic Progress Card, tracking student progress for achieving learning outcomes A new and comprehensive National Curriculum Framework for school education, Early Childhood Care & Education, Teacher Education and Adult Education. By 2030, the minimum degree qualification for teaching will be a 4-year integrated B.Ed. degree. Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on School Education 10.10 Since March 2020, most of the schools are closed due to the COVID-19 induced restrictions and children are taught online from their homes using available assets at home. Access to data network, electronic devices such as computer, laptop, smart phone etc. gained importance due to distance learning and remote working. As per Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2020 Wave-1 (Rural), released in October 2020, percentage of enrolled children from government and private schools owning a smartphone increased enormously from 36.5 per cent in 2018 to 61.8 per cent in 2020 in rural India. If utilized well, the resultant reduction in the digital divide between rural and urban, gender, age and income groups is likely to reduce inequalities in educational outcomes (Figure 2 and Figure 3). To enable this process, the Government is implementing several initiatives to make education accessible to children during this pandemic (Box 3).334 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Figure 2: Persons (age 5-14 & 15-29 years) by Ability to Operate Computer and Ability to Use Internet, 2017-18Fig 2 01020304050607080 Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female Rural Urban Rural Urban Ability to Operate Computer Ability to Use Internet 5-14 years 15-29 years Source: NSS Report No.585-Household Social Consumption on Education in India, 2017-18 Figure 3: Households with Computer and Internet Facility for Each Quintile Class of Usual Monthly Per Capita Internet FacilityRural Urban Source: NSS Report No.585-Household Social Consumption on Education in India, 2017-18 Box 3: Initiatives for school going students during COVID-19 pandemic 1. PM eVIDYA: This initiative was announced for school and higher education under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat programme in May, 2020. It is a comprehensive initiative to unify all efforts related to digital/online/on-air education to enable multi-mode and equitable access to education for students and teachers. The four PM e-Vidya components of school education are: a. One nation, one digital education infrastructur e: Under this component all States/UTs have free access to a single digital infrastructure i.e, DIKSHA. It is artificial intelligence based, highly scalable, and can be accessed through a web-portal and mobile application. It provides access to a large number of curricula linked e-content through several use cases and solutions such as QR coded Energized Textbooks (ETBs), courses for teachers, quizzes and Per centPer cent Quintile Class335 Social Infrastructure, Employment and Human Development others. DIKSHA has experienced more than 800 crore hits since lockdown. In April, 2020, VidyaDaan portal was launched on DIKSHA as a national content contribution program that leverages the DIKSHA platform and tools to seek and allow contribution/donation of e-learning resources for school education by educational bodies, private bodies, and individual experts. b. One class, one TV channels through Swayam Prabha TV Channels: Swayam Prabha DTH channels are meant to support and reach those who do not have access to the internet. 12 channels are devoted to telecast high quality educational programmes in school education. The pilot/beta version has been launched in October, 2020. c. Extensive use of Radio, Community radio and Podcasts: Radio broadcasting is being used for children in remote areas who are not online. 303 pieces of curriculum-based radio programmes (for Classes 1-8) have been produced by CIET-NCERT for its dissemination/broadcast on 12 GyanVani FM Radio Stations, 60 Community Radio Stations, iRadio and Jio Saavn Mobile apps. 289 Community Radio Stations have also been used to broadcast content for NIOS for grades 9 to 12. A Podcast of CBSE called Shiksha Vani is being effectively used by learners of grades 9 to12. It contains over 430 pieces of audio content for all subjects of grades 9 to 12. d. For the differ ently-abled: One DTH channel is being operated specifically for hearing impaired students in sign language. For visually and hearing-impaired students, study material has been developed in Digitally Accessible Information System (DAISY) and in sign language; both are available on NIOS website/ YouTube. 25 NCERT textbooks have also been converted into DAISY format. 2. Swayam MOOCs for open schools and pre-service education: Online MOOC courses relating to NIOS (grades 9 to 12 of open schooling) are uploaded on SWAYAM portal. Around 92 courses have started and 1.5 crore students are enrolled under Swayam MOOCs. 3. Funding support for digital initiative: To mitigate the effect of COVID-19, ` 818.17 crore is allotted to states/UTs to promote online learning through digital initiatives, and ` 267.86 crore for online teacher training to ensure continuous professional development of teachers under Samagra Shiksha Scheme. 4. National Repository of Open Educational Resources (NROER): NROER is an open storehouse of e-content. Nearly 17,500 pieces of e-content are available for various school subjects in all grades. 5. PRAGYA TA guidelines on digital education was developed with a focus on online/blended/ digital education for students who are presently at home due to the closure of schools. 6. MANODARPAN: The 'Manodarpan' initiative for psychosocial support has been included in the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, as part of strengthening and empowering the human capital to increase productivity and efficiency through reforms and initiatives in the education sector . SKILL DEVELOPMENT 10.11 There is an improvement in the proportion of skilled people over the annual cycle of Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) across rural, urban and gender classification (Table 6). 336 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 However, the level of skill acquirement remained low, as only 2.4 per cent of the workforce of age 15-59 years have received formal vocational / technical training and another 8.9 per cent of the workforce received training through informal sources. Out of the 8.9 per cent workforce who received non-formal training, the largest chunk is contributed by on-the-job training (3.3 per cent), followed by self-learning (2.5 per cent) and hereditary sources (2.1 per cent) and other sources (1 per cent).

The Government is committed to take all measures to translate India's demographic advantage by various skill development initiatives (Box 4). Box 4: Policy Reforms under Skill Development Initiatives Operationalizing Unified Skill Regulator: A significant step to make the skill ecosystem more dynamic and credible has been undertaken through the operationalization of the unified skills regulator- National Council for V ocational Education and Training (NCVET). As a first milestone towards more credible certifications and assessments, the Awarding and Assessment Bodies guidelines was notified in October 2020. Unique numbered certification has also been approved by the new regulator. The regulatory capacity is being continuously strengthened through notification of various standardization processes, regulatory systems, human resources, LMIS and research capabilities with an aim to create a regulatory institution at par with international standards. Pradhan Mantri Kaushal V ikas Yojana 3.0 (PMKVY 3.0): of PMKVY 3.0 was rolled out in 2020-21 with a tentative target to skill 8 lakh candidates including migrants. A paradigm shift in implementation strategy is adopted by making it demand driven with bottom up approach for identification and mapping of job roles. District Skill Committees (DSCs) would be playing a pivotal role under the guidance of State Skill Development Missions in337 Social Infrastructure, Employment and Human Development PMKVY 3.0. DSC shall be the focal point of implementation of PMKVY 3.0 and shall play a major role in preparation of District level plan, mobilization and counselling of candidates, formation of training batches, monitoring of quality assurance and post training support. A phase-wise introduction of vocational courses in schools shall be initiated in coordination with Ministry of Education. This component shall be implemented for classes 9 to 12 to expose students to skill development avenues. Quality Enhancement: Towards enhancing the quality of long-term training programs and providing a choice to learners about the institutes, the grading of ITIs has been undertaken to improve their quality and transparency. Draft grading of ~11000 ITIs have already been published. For ensuring greater industrial connect, new model of Dual System of Training (DST) and Flexi MoUs is being implemented under which more than 950 MoUs with enterprises have already been signed. Integration of V ocational and Formal education both at school and higher education: The efforts towards integration of V ocational Education and Training (VET) in general education has received a big fillip with the NEP, 2020 envisioning giving 50 per cent of school and higher education candidates exposure to VET over the next 5 years. Some of the key ingredients of VET integration includes offering vocational courses in schools and equal weightage to vocational courses for admission in undergraduate courses have been implemented. The draft Credit Framework for vertical and horizontal mobility from vocational to general and vice-versa is being developed. A 'hub-n-spoke' model is also being piloted in 2 States with the conceptual framework of early introduction of VET in schools and an ITI becoming a 'Hub' for providing VET related training and exposure to students of adjoining 5-7 schools. It is hoped that the artificial separation of the education system into formal and vocational shall end with such enabling frameworks allowing seamless integration. STATUS OF EMPLOYMENT 10.13 Based on the results of PLFS, estimates in absolute numbers of labour force, employed persons and unemployed persons have been derived for 2017-18 and 2018-19, separately for rural and urban sectors and for males and females in usual status (ps+ss)4 for all ages (Table 7). 10.14 The size of labour force in 2018-19 was estimated at about 51.8 crore persons: about 48.8 crore employed and 3.0 crore unemployed. The size of the labour force increased by about 0.85 crore between 2017-18 and 2018-19. Out of these, 0.46 crore were from urban sector and 0.39 crore were from rural sector. The gender composition of the increase in the labour force comprised about 0.64 crore males and about 0.21 crore females. The size of the workforce increased by about 1.64 crore, of which 1.22 crore were in rural sector and 0.42 crore in urban sector. The gender composition was 0.92 crore females and 0.72 crore males. 4The workers in the usual status (ps+ss) are obtained by considering the usual principal status (ps) and the subsidiary status (ss) together. The workers in the usual status (ps+ss) include (a) the persons who worked for a relatively long part of the 365 days preceding the date of survey and (b) the persons from among the remaining population who had worked at least for 30 days during the reference period of 365 days preceding the date of survey.338 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Number of unemployed persons declined by about 0.79 crore between 2017-18 and 2018-19, largely in the category of females, and in rural sector. The females labour force participation rate increased from 17.5 per cent in 2017-18 to 18.6 per cent in 2018-19. These facts reveal that 2018-19 was a good year for employment generation. Table 7: Estimates of Labour Force, Employment, and Unemployment for year 2017-18 and 2018-19 (all ages; ps+ss, in crore) CategoryRural Urban Total MaleFemale Total Male Female Total Male Female Total 2017-18 and 2018-19 Surveys. The estimates are approximate. Note 1: Projected population as on 1st January, 2018 was 135 crore which has been derived using the NSO EUS (2011-12) formula, A = A1 * [1 + R /100] (82/120), and population as on 1st January 2019 was 137 crore projected with the formula A = A1 * [1 + R /100](94/120), where A1 is the census population as on 1st March 2011, R is the percentage decadal change in population between census 2001 and 2011 and A is the projected population as on 1st January, 2018 and as on 1st January 2019 respectively. Note 2: Principal status (ps) measures the activity in which an individual has spent relatively longer time of a reference year (major time criterion) while subsidiary status (ss) measures the activity status of an individual who has spent majority of days out of work force but have worked for short period of time (more than 30 days). 10.15 Industry-wise estimates on workforce shows that the largest, about 21.5 crore persons are employed in 'Agriculture', which is still the largest employer with 42.5 per cent of workforce (Annexure I). Next important industry is 'other services' where about 6.4 crore persons (13.8 per cent) were engaged. 'Manufacturing' and 'Trade, hotel & restaurants' each employed about 5.9 crore persons with the share of nearly 12.1 per cent and 12.6 per cent respectively, while 'Construction' sector employed about 5.7 crore persons in 2018-19 with share of 12.1 per cent. Employed persons have significantly increased in Agriculture, Manufacturing and Transport storage & communication in 2018-19 from 2017-18 (Annexure I). 10.16 Among the tota l employed, about 25 crore are self-employed, 12.2 crore regular wage/ salaried employees and 11.5 crore casual workers (Table 8). Self-employment is still the major source of employment with close to 52 per cent of the workforce was self-employed. The proportion of regular wage/salaried employees saw an increase in both rural & urban areas and for both males & females. This increase was more among urban females which increased from 52.1 per cent in 2017-18 to 54.7 per cent in 2018-19. This also indicates the improvement in quality of employment. At the same time, the proportion of casual labour showed a decline, 339 Social Infrastructure, Employment and Human Development which was more in the case of urban females from 13.1 per cent in 2017-18 to 10.7 per cent in 2018-19, as compared to males from 15.1 per cent in 2017-18 to 14.2 per cent in 2018-19. The quarterly PLFS covers only the urban areas and it may be seen that the proportion of male engaged as regular wage/salaried employees has increased during the period January-March, 2020 from the January-March, 2019, while decline was noticed for both male and female in the category of causal labours during the same period (Table 9).

Formal Employment 10.17 The net payroll data of Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) as on 20th December, 2020 shows a net increase of new subscribers in EPFO of 78.58 lakhs in 2019-20 as compared to 61.1 lakhs in 2018-19. These estimates are net of the members newly enrolled, exited and re-joined during the year as per records of the EPFO. During FY 2020-21, the net new EPF subscribers shows an increase across all age groups and had peaked in September, 2020 to 14.2 lakh subscribers. Age-wise net new EPF subscribers from April to September 2020 is presented in Figure 4. Data from Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal 340 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Trade also shows that employment reported by startups increased from 1.52 lakh in January- December, 2019 to 1.75 lakh in January-December, 2020 due to increase in the number of active recognition of startups from 11,694 to 14,784 in the same period.

Unemployment 10.18 Unemployment rates at all India level, for all ages, as per usual status, declined marginally to 5.8 per cent in 2018-19 from 6.1 per cent in 2017-18. Figure 5 compares the unemployment rate for various categories like rural, urban, youth, SC, OBC etc., between 2017-18 and 2018-19. Most of the categories are either on the red line (45-degree) or below the line, which show that unemployment rates have remained the same or declined in 2018-19 as compared to 2017-18. 10.19 The decline in unemployment rate is widespread across all the categories. The highest decline in unemployment rates is seen among those who have received formal vocational/ technical training. The level of unemployment is recorded the highest, 20.2 per cent, among urban youth (age 15-29 years) and the lowest for the subgroup 'not literates' at 1.1 per cent among the persons of age 15 years and above with different educational attainments. 10.20 Youth unemployment rates of State/UT s in 2018-19 for urban and rural areas are plotted in Figure 6. The youth unemployment rates varies widely across States in India. The States like Arunachal Pradesh, Kerala, Manipur, and Bihar are on the high extreme while the States such as Gujarat, Karnataka, West Bengal and Sikkim are on the lower extreme. States/UTs on the red line or close to it, such as Bihar, Himachal Pradesh and Maharashtra, indicates that their youth unemployment rate in urban areas is almost equal to the unemployment rate in rural areas, and the States/UTs above the line indicate higher youth unemployment in urban than rural. It is quite visible that unemployment rates in urban are much higher than the rural sector in most of the States/UTs.

Labour Reforms 10.21 Years 2019 and 2020 are landmark years in the history of labour reforms, when the country saw the nearly 29 Central Labour laws being amalgamated, rationalized and simplified into four labour codes viz.: (i) the Code on Wages, 2019, (ii) the Industrial Relations Code, 2020, (iii) the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020 and (iv) the Code on Social Security, 2020, thereby bringing these laws in tune with the changing labour market trends and at the same time accommodating the minimum wage requirement and welfare needs of the unorganized sector workers, including the self-employed and migrant workers, within the framework of legislation. The reforms was a long drawn process spread over nearly three decades as may be seen in Box 5. The highlights of each of the Labour Codes are given in Annexure II.342 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Box 5: Chronology of Labour Reforms post 1991 S.

AhluwaliaTo increase share of organized sector in total employment problem of labour laws need to be addressed. Deletion of Chapter VB of Industrial Disputes Act. Introduce short term employment contracts where workers can be hired on contract basis by paying premium wage. Introduce \"strike ballot\" -a strike can be called only if supported by a qualifying majority of workers. Timelimit for three years for filing industrial disputes. Amendment of Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) (R&A) Act, to allow outsourcing of peripheral activities from specialized firms.343 Social Infrastructure, Employment and Human Development 7Report of the Steering Committee on Labour & Employment for Tenth Five Year Plan (2002-07)2001 Dr. S.

The Commission opined, \"... in an attempt to rationalize labour laws, we could, with advantage, group the existing labour laws into well-recognised functional groups. While the ultimate object must be to incorporate all such provisions in a comprehensive Code, such a codification may have to be done in stages and what we have proposed is hopefully the first step'.Labour code should also lay down a floor of substantive labour rights or standards such as minimum wages, maximum hours of work, minimum standards of safety and health at workplace etc as a form of basic law which would be applicable to all workers. Need for National Floor Level Minimum Wage (NFLMW) applicable to all employments. States to fix Minimum Wages above NFLMW.344 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 10 Tenth Five Year Plan, V ol-I & II, Labour Welfare & Social Security2002-07 Shri K. C. Pant, Dy. Chairman, Planning CommissionRigid labour laws applied to the organised sector make it difficult for the entrepreneur to rationalise labour than to dispose of capital assets when the need arises. Effective cost of labour to the entrepreneur can be many times the nominal wage bill. Reform labour laws. Exempt small scale industry from the rigour of labour laws by replacing compliance through self-certification and introducing random inspection. State Governments authorised to amend labour laws as per their requirements. Encourage social dialogue to reduce industrial disputes. Legislative and adminstrative framework be created for providing social secuity cover to unorganised sector workers. A National Policy on Minimum Wages be evolved to reduce inter-state variations. Creation of a reliable information system for labour migration, initially by conducting a Survey. 11 National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganized Sector2009 Dr. Arjun SenguptaRecommended a separate legislation for providing social security to unorganized sector workers and also a National Social Security scheme for providing minimum social security to the workers. 12 Eleventh Five Year Plan V ol-I, Inclusive Growth2007-12 Dr. Montek Singh Ahluwaliah, Dy. Chairman, Planning CommissionLack of flexibility in labour laws, such as Chapter V-B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and Contract Labour (R&A) Act, which focus on job protection, remains a psychological block for entrepreneurs against establishing new enterprises with a large workforce. Contract Labour (R&A) Act results in the industry letting go of opportunities for seasonal supplies, from external markets. In a globalized economy, manufacturers have to compete with rivals who enjoy greater flexibility, so it is necessary to find practical solutions for the problems created by these laws. Review existing laws and regulations to : encourage the corporate sector to move into more labour-intensive sectors and facilitate the expansion of employment and output of the unorganized enterprises that operate in the labour-intensive sectors.345 Social Infrastructure, Employment and Human Development 13 Report of the Working Group on Labour Laws & other Regulations for the Twelfth Five Year Plan (2012-17)2007-12 Shri P. C. Chaturvedi, Secretary, M/o Labour & EmploymentConsolidation, simplification and rationali - zation of labour laws to reduce multiplic-ity of laws and for better enforcement and effective compliance. This would help in moving closer to uniform labour policy on common issues. The Group recommended four cognate groups for consolidation: viz (A) Law governing Industrial Relations to include Industrial Disputes Act, Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, and Trade Unions Act. (B) Laws governing Wages will cover Equal Remuneration Act, Minimum Wages Act, Payment of Bonus Act, and Payment of Wages Act. (C) Laws governing Social Security would cover Employees' State Insurance Act, Employ-ees Provident Fund & Miscellaneous Provi-sions Act and Payment of Gratuity Act (D) Laws governing Working Conditions & Welfare would include Factories Act, 1948, Maternity Benefit Act, Workmen's Com- pensation Act, Contract Labour (R&A) Act and Inter-State Migrant Workers (RE&CS) Act and (E) Welfare Cess Laws -All Cess Act and Welfare Fund Acts to be clubbed into one Act. 14 Twelfth Five Year Plan V ol-II, Employment & Skill Development2012-17 Dr. Montek Singh Ahluwaliah, Dy.

In a major initiative for bringing compliance in the system and ensuring ease of doing business, a set of labour reform measures has been put forth by the government.Facilitating Presidential Assent for labour reforms in Rajasthan sets an example for further reform initiatives by the States.346 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 16 Economic Survey, V olume-I, Chapter-32018-19 Department of Economic Affairs, M/o FinanceRigidity in the labour laws make employers in Inflexible States prefer substituting labour with capital. Inflexible states due to rigidity of their labour laws suffer in all dimensions as they are unable to create enough employment, cannot attract adequate capital into their states and their wages are lower as their productivity is lower. The Survey recommended deregulating labour law restrictions can create significantly more jobs. 17 Labour Codes- Present status2020 Ministry of Labour & EmploymentThe Government has simplified, rationalized and amalgamated 29 Central Labour Laws/Acts into four Labour Codes, viz.: (i) the Code on Wages, 2019, (ii) the Industrial Relations Code, 2020, (iii) Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020, (iv) Code on Social Security, 2020. The Code on Wages has been notified on 08.08.2019. The other three Codes, namely, the Industrial Relations Code, the Occupation Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code and the Code on Social Security have been notified on 29.09.2020. Source: Survey Compilation from Government websites Changing Nature of Work: Gig and Platform Workers 10.22 The nature of work has been changing with the change in technology, evolution of new economic activities, innovation in organization structures and evolving business models. Digital platforms have emerged as enablers for employment creation with the power to easily discover job seekers and job providers in the absence of middlemen. Apart from traditional forces, these new forces have created massive opportunities for the consumer and service provider to interact through innovative ways. Digital technology enables two-sided markets 5 which saw the emergence of e-commerce and online retailing platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart, Ola, Uber, Urban Clap, Zomato, Swiggy etc. India has emerged as one of the largest country for flexi-staffing in the world. 10.23 During the period of COVID-19 induced lockdown, the increasing role of the gig economy was evident with significant growth of online retail business. The lockdown period also saw employers preferring 'Work from home' of their employees, cutting down on staff strength and engaging freelancers or outsourcing tasks to reduce overhead costs as well as to hire skilled services. With increasing demand in industries for on hire project-specific consultants, logo/content designers, web designers etc. for the white-collar workers, the delivery boys and taxi 5Two-sided market is one in which i) two sets of agents interact through an intermediary or platform, and ii) the decisions of each set of agents affects the outcomes of the other set of agents, typically through an externality [Rysman, Marc. 2009. 'The Economics of Two Sided Market'. Journal of Economic Perspectives, 23 (3): 125-143].347 Social Infrastructure, Employment and Human Development drivers engaged in platforms like Uber/Ola, Swiggy, Big Basket, Pizza Hut etc, are now showing potential as well. As a result, the gig economy have been popular amongst the workers in India. The benefit of the gig economy is that it allows flexibility in employer-employee relationship to both service seeker and service provider. 10.24 The nature of job contract for a gig worker is different from the contract between an employer and employee/worker. Their labour contract is usually shorter and more specific to the task or job assigned. Their employment type might be either temporary or contractual and certainly not regular. The nature of payment against the work is more of piece rate, negotiable, may be as wage or partly as profit/reward than a fixed salary. The control over their work by employer varies in degree but in any case, is not full. The workers most of the time are flexible to decide on when to work, where to work etc. 10.25 Till recently , gig or platform workers were devoid of their basic rights and social security protections mainly because they were neither considered as worker nor employee under definition of employee in the labour laws of the country and were not entitled to legal protections under labour laws. For the first time, these class of workers have been brought under the ambit of the newly introduced Code on Social Security 2020 by defining them exclusively in the category of unorganized worker for providing social security benefits (Annexure II). Impact of COVID-19 on the Labour Market 10.26 COVID-19 has exposed the vulnerability of urban casual workers, who account for 1 1.2 per cent of urban workforce (All-India) as per PLFS, January-March, 2020, a significant proportion of them are supposed to be migrants who were impacted by the lockdown. About 63.19 lakh migrant workers travelled through Shramik Special trains from May-August 2020. With limited data available on inter-state migration and employment in informal sectors, it is difficult to figure the numbers of migrants who lost jobs and accommodation during the pandemic and returned home. Government of India has taken several initiatives for the welfare of workers during the pre-lockdown and lockdown period to mitigate the crisis (Box 6). Box 6: Programmes and schemes to improve employment opportunities Aatmanirbhar Bharat 3.0 package announced in November, 2020 has total estimated outlay of ` 22,810 crore for the scheme period i.e., up to wage month 31st May, 2023. The scheme proposes to pay: (i) Entire employees' and employers' contribution (12 per cent of employees' EPF and 12 per cent of employers' EPF contribution or statutory rate applicable to establishment) i.e. 24 per cent of wages towards EPF in respect of new employees in establishments employing up to 1000 employees (contributing EPF members with UAN) during the period from October, 2020 to June, 2021 and also to re-employee who lost their jobs due to COVID-19. (ii) Only employees' share of EPF contribution (i.e. 12 per cent) of wages in respect of new employees in establishments employing more than 1000 employee during the period from October 2020 to June 2021, and also to re-employee who lost their jobs due to COVID-19.348 Economic was on 9th August, 2016 with the objective to incentivise employers for creation of new employment. Under the scheme, Government of India was paying 8.33 per cent of the employer EPS contribution for all sectors in respect of these new employees. The scheme targeted employees earning upto ` 15,000 per month and with the aims to cover a large number of informal workers to the formal workforce. The benefits of the scheme were extended to the textile sector under PMPRPY for made-ups and apparels sector with an additional 3.67 per cent of the employers EPF contribution, thus bringing the total incentive to 12 per cent towards EPF and EPS both. The scope of the scheme was further enhanced w.e.f. 01.04.2018 to provide the benefit of full 12 per cent employers' contribution for all sectors. Under the scheme, benefits have been provided to 1.21 crore beneficiaries through 1.52 lakh establishments. The terminal date for registration of beneficiary through establishment was 31 st March, 2019. The average share of workers in eligible enterprises has improved from 62.6 per cent to 64 per cent and the share of workers eligible for EPF within the eligible enterprises has increased from 32.5 per cent to 37.5 per cent (Figure 7).These, facts support the view that the formalization of the workers in eligible enterprises has improved with the incentive under the PMRPY scheme. Figure 7: Formalization Effect of PMPRY: Share of Enterprises (>=20 workers) in total workers Share of workers with EPF in workers in Entpr (>= 20 workers) Mean (Share of workers in Enterprises (20 >= workers) in total workers) Mean (Share of workers with EPF in workers in Entpr (20 >= workers )PMRPY: 12% paid from April 2018 to March 2019 Source: Unit level PLFS quarterly data. Note: Workers getting regular wage/salaries. Other measures In order to provide relief to the organized sector employees, a notification issued on 28th March, 2020 by the Government provisioning non-refundable advance of 75 per cent of outstanding balance or 3 months' wages whichever is lower, allowed to the members of EPFO. As on 9th December, 2020, 53.62 lakh members of EPFO have availed facility of online withdrawal amounting to ` 13,587.53 crore. Reduction in statutory rate of contribution from 12 per cent to 10 per cent for wage months May, June and July, 2020 for all class of establishments covered under the EPF & MP Act, 1952 announced as part of Atmanirbhar Bharat package. Reduction in rate of EPF contributions is intended to benefit 4.3 crore employees and employers of 6.5 lakh establishments to tide over the immediate liquidity crisis to some extent.349 Social Infrastructure, Employment and Human Development Under Prime Minister's Garib Kalyan Package (PMGKP) financial assistance was given to building & other construction workers (BOCW) which lar gely included migrant workers from the funds collected under BOCW's cess. 31 State/UT Governments have announced cash benefits, ranging from ` 1000 to ` 6000 per month to around 2.0 crore workers and total amount of ` 4973.65 crore was disbursed. Shramik Special Trains: The Indian Railways operated special trains as per the State Government's request to facilitate migrant labourers/stranded passengers from 1st May 2020. These special trains facilitated about 63.19 lakh migrant workers to reach their destination between 1 st May 2020 to 31st August 2020. GENDER DIMENSION OF EMPLOYMENT 10.27 LFPR of females in the productive age (15-59 years) was 26.5 per cent in 2018-19, as compared to 80.3 per cent for males (rural+urban). While 54.7 per cent of urban women were employed in the regular wage/salaried category, about 59.6 per cent of rural females were not only self-employed but 37.9 per cent among them were helpers in household enterprises. The low female LFPR is attributed to high participation of women (15 years & above) in domestic duties (activity code of 92 & 93 of NCO, 2004), that is 55.7 per cent in rural areas and 59.1 per cent in urban areas in 2018-19. 10.28 The NSO conducted Time Use Survey (TUS) during Jan-Dec, 2019 which inter- alia, provides insights on how males and females spend their time in rural and urban areas in various activities during a 24-hour time period. It is observed that time spent by a female on unpaid domestic services and unpaid caregiving services to household members is prominent and higher than male counterparts (Figure 8). Time spent on employment-related activities by female members is 127 minutes lower than male. Among unpaid caregiving services for household members, females spent disproportionately higher time on childcare and instruction as compared to males (Figure 9). Similarly, among unpaid domestic services for household members, females spent most of the time in food, meal management and preparation (Figure 10).

As shown in Table 10, even with education level of \"secondary and above\", women spend 295 minutes in unpaid domestic services for household members and 146 minutes in unpaid caregiving services for household members. 10.30 In terms of contribution to the economy, while women of productive age group spent 337 minutes in unpaid non-SNA activity6, it was only 41 minutes in the case of males. Similarly, males spent 305 minutes in paid activities, while it was only 68 minutes for females (Figure 11). Figure 11: Average Time (in minutes) Spent in a Day per Person in Paid and Unpaid Activities (15-59 age group) 32 41 305 27 337 68 050100150200250300350400 Unpaid SNA activities Unpaid non-SNA activitiesPaid activities Male Female Source: Time Use Survey, 2019 (Table 42, Appendix A) 10.31 Similarly, the time spent on unpaid domestic and care giving services (340 minutes or 5.6 hrs) is high for females in the workforce as compared to males but relatively less than females who are not in the labour force (457 minutes or 7.60 hours) (Table 11). Thus, women in the workforce shoulder the responsibility of domestic activities as well as paid work, which leaves them with less time to spend on employment related activities. 10.32 There was no distinction among social groups as regards the time spent on unpaid non- SNA activities which was highest among 'Others' group (286 minutes) followed by SC (285 minutes). Time spent by females on paid activities was highest for ST (75 minutes). We can see the women of ST social group are positioned better compared to other social groups as regards paid activities (Table 12). 6Unpaid activities include taking care of children, elderly in the household, production of goods and services for own consumption, while paid activities include self-employment, regular wage/salary jobs and casual work. SNA production activity include employment, Unpaid direct volunteering for other households for production of goods or for production of goods/services for market/non-market units, Unpaid community and organization-based volun-teering for production of goods or for production of goods/services for market/non-market units,etc and Non-SNA Production includes Unpaid domestic services for household members, Unpaid caregiving services for household members, Unpaid direct volunteering for other households for production of services for the households and Unpaid community- and organization-based volunteering for production of services for the households (Source: TUS, 2019).352 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Table 11: Average Time (in minutes) Spent in a Day per Participant of Different Broad Usual Principal Activity Status Activity StatusEmployment and related activitiesUnpaid domestic services for household membersUnpaid caregiving services for household members Male Female Male Female Male Female Worker 472 382 93 237 71 103 Unemployed 245 233 112 222 102 157 Labour Force 470 381 93 237 72 105 Not in a labour force 170 182 112 317 100 140 Source: Time Use Survey, 2019 Table 12: Average Time (in minutes) Spent in a Day per Person in Paid and Unpaid Activities Among Various Social Groups ActivitiesST SC OBC Others Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female Unpaid SNA activities 51 48 27 23 29 23 24 18 Unpaid non-SNA activities 42 266 38 285 37 279 37 286All Unpaid activities 94 313 65 307 66 303 61 304 Paid activities 218 75 247 60 238 56 247 45 Source: Time Use Survey, 2019 (Table 44, Appendix A) 10.33 In order to incentivise more women to join into the labour force, investment in institutional support to af fordable and quality child care facilities, paid paternal leave, family-friendly work environment, and support for elderly care needs to be made. There is also a need to promote non-discriminatory practices at the workplace like pay and career progression, improve work incentives, including other medical and social security benefits for female workers. HEALTH 10.34 COVID-19 demonstrated the importance of investing and strengthening public health system. India has made significant progress in improving its health outcomes over the last two decades by eliminating Polio, Guinea worm disease, Yaws and maternal & neonatal Tetanus. Health indicators shows, Total Fertility Rate (TFR) has reduced sharply from 3.6 in 1991 to 2.2 in 2018. Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) was 113 per 1,00,000 live births for the period 2016-2018 and Under Five Mortality Rate (U5MR) was 36 per 1000 live births in 2018. But in 2020, it was the COVID-19 pandemic that put to test the health infrastructure of India. The pandemic brought forth the inherent strengths of the medical fraternity in effectively managing the spread of the disease. There are more than 1 crore C OVID -19 cases reported in India, with recovery of more than 95 per cent. However, the country lost around 1.52 lakh lives due to the C OVID -19 pandemic7. Public health measures were taken in pre-emptive, pro-active and graded manner based on the evolving scenario. To provide, financial support, 'COVID-19 Emergency Response 7As on 12.01.2021 (Source: www.covid19india.org). 353 Social Infrastructure, Employment and Human Development and Health Systems Preparedness Package' of `15000 crore was announced and implemented with an aim to deliver a combination of emergency response and health system capacity building efforts. Government has taken several measures including world's largest vaccination drive to prevent, control, and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 (Box 7). Box 7: Achievements in Fight Against COVID-19 The Government has assessed and ensured the availability of the essential medicines, hand sanitizers as well as protective equipments including masks, PPE Kits. A fast-track processing of applications for clinical trials and new drug including vaccines for COVID-19. Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) issued a circular on easing out the lot release of Human vaccines for smooth supply due to COVID-19 pandemic situation on 3rd April, 2020 and published a notice on extending validity of WHO GMP/CoPP certificate in light of COVID-19 situation on 1st May, 2020. CDSCO issued letter to States Drugs Controller requesting for regular survey on availability of formulations like Azithromycin, Paracetamol and Hydroxychloroquine. Government has issued notification on 18 th May, 2020 so that manufacturer can manufacture and stock any vaccine for COVID-19, which is under clinical trial, for sale or distribution after completion of clinical trial and grant of manufacturing approval by CDSCO. Considering the emergency and unmet medical need, CDSCO has approved following three drugs for Restricted Emergency Use in the country for treatment of COVID-19 infection: Remdesivir Injectable formulations for treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 infection initially on 1st June 2020 for import and marketing and subsequently, for manufacture and marketing the same drug to three indigenous manufacturers. Manufacturing and marketing permission on 19th June 2020 for Favipiravir Tablets for mild to moderate COVID-19 infection. Marketing permission on 10.07.20 for Itolizumab injection for the treatment of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) in moderate to severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) patients due to COVID-19 CDSCO has been able to process more than 150 applicati ons of C OVID -19 related new drug and clinical trial applications after thorough deliberation of the proposals in more than 25 Subject Experts Committee meetings through video conference till 4 th December 2020. CDSCO has approved a total of 242 diagnostic kits for COVID-19 on fast-track basis which includes 124 RT PCR kits and 118 Rapid antibody kits till 4th December, 2020. Ministry of A YUSH issued an advisory about self-care guidelines and preventive health measures for immunity . Ministry launched a three-month campaign on \"AYUSH for Immunity\". A Fit Health W orker Campaign was launched at Auyshman Bharat-Health & Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs) to enable the screening and early detection of non-communicable diseases in the Frontline-Health care workers. This enabled the screening of more than 12 lakh in 502 districts till 1 st December, 2020 to enable them to take preventive, promotive and curative measures and also caution them towards their risk categorization towards COVID -19 as these frontline workers were not only involved in ensuring essential services at these centres but also played a crucial role in community-based surveillance and pandemic outbreak management related activities in the community. 354 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 The 'PMGKP Insu rance Scheme for Health Workers Fighting COVID-19' was announced on 30th March 2020. The Scheme provides and insurance cover of ` 50 lakh to healthcare providers, including community health workers, who may have to be in direct contact and care of COVID-19 patients and therefore at risk of being infected. COVID -19 Vaccine : The world's largest COVID-19 immunization programme commenced on 16th January 2021 through the two indigenously manufactured vaccines viz; COVISHIELD and COV AXIN. Based on the humane principle the people at maximum risk of getting infected, about 3 crore people mainly frontline health workers have been offered the vaccine in the first round, while about 30 crores including elderly and people with serious co-morbidities will be vaccinated in the second round. As on 24 th January, 2021, 16.13 lakh beneficiaries were vaccinated (PIB release dated 24th January, 2021). The vaccination exercise is underpinned by the principles of people's participation (Jan Bhagidari), utilizing experience of elections (booth strategy) and Universal Immunization Program (UIP). There will be no compromise of existing healthcare services, especially national programs and primary health care; on scientific and regulatory norms, other SOPs. The Co-WIN software has been developed by Government for real time information of vaccine stocks, their storage temperature and individualized tracking of beneficiaries for COVID-19 vaccine, which has been operationalized. 10.35 Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs): ASHAs played a key role in the country's response for prevention and management of the COVID-19. During the pandemic, in addition to performing tasks related to COVID-19, they also continued to support community members for accessing essential health services such as anti-natal care, immunization, safe delivery and treatment adherence for chronic illnesses. All ASHAs and ASHA facilitators were covered under PMGKP insurance scheme (Box 7). Their incentives were increased to ` 2000 per month. Child health outcomes 10.36 The Phase-I of National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5)8, shows that immunization coverage for children has increased for all 10 States under analysis except for Kerala. The cash incentives for institutional delivery of pregnant women and ASHAs under Janani Suraksha Yojana Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) aims to reduce maternal and infant mortality rates. NFHS-5 shows significant improvement in the institutional birth in selcted States (Figure 12A). The inter-State difference on immunization and institutional birth has come down in NFHS-5 in those States showing low level of immunization and institutional birth in NFHS-4 (Figure 12B). 10.37 Infant mortali ty rate and under five mortality rate have declined in most of the selected States in NFHS-5 compared to NFHS-4 (Figure 13). However, inter-State difference in mortality rates remained quite large. The findings also show mixed picture on stunting, wasting and anaemic children. When compared to declined in Andhra Pradesh, 8NFHS-5, 2019-20, Phase-I covered 17 States & 5 UTs for the period of Aug-Dec, 2019. Due to change in the boundary of districts between NFHS-4 and NFHS-5, only 263 out of 342 districts data were comparable. Hence, point estimates of NFHS-5 needs to be compared with interval estimates of NFHS-4 (2015-16).355 Social Infrastructure, Employment and Human Development in NFHS-5. Similarly, Andhra Karnataka have done better in reducing underweight children during the same period. Wasting has also declined in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Karnataka during NFHS-5 (Figure 14). To address the problem of malnutrition in the country, Anganwadi Services, Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana and Scheme for Adolescent Girls under the Umbrella Integrated Child Development Services Scheme (ICDS) are some targeted interventions of the Government. PM Overarching Scheme for Holistic Nutrition (POSHAN) Abhiyan was launched on 8 th March, 2018 to address the problem of malnutrition in a mission-mode.

The AYUSH HWCs would be created by upgrading existing AYUSH dispensaries (10000) and Sub Health Centres (2500) to provide comprehensive primary health care to the general public with focus on the AYUSH system of medicine. A total of 4061 facilities are approved for upgradation as AYUSH HWCs in 27 States/UTs during 2019-20 and 2020-21. Per 1000 live births, 2019-20 Per 1000 live births, 2015-16357 Social Infrastructure, Employment and Human Development WATER AND SANITATION Swachh Bharat Mission-Grameen (SBM-G) 10.39 Under SBM-G, rural sanitation coverage has made an incredible leap in the target achievement from 39 per cent in 2014 to 100 per cent in 2019 with more than 10 crore toilets built since 2014. UNICEF study on 'Access to Toilets and Safety, Convenience and Self-respect of Women in Rural India' (February, 2020), states that 91 per cent of the women reported that they have been able to save upto an hour and do not have to travel up to a kilometre for defecation after the construction of toilets. With a view to sustain the gains made under the programme in the last five years and to ensure that no one is left behind and to achieve the overall cleanliness in villages, Phase-II of SBM(G) from 2020-21 to 2024-25 is being implemented with a total outlay of ` 1,40,881 crores focusing on Open Defecation Free (ODF) sustainability and Solid & Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) through convergence between different verticals of financing and various schemes of Central and State Governments such as 15 th Finance Commission grants to local bodies, MGNREGS, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds etc. Further, PMGKRA was also launched in June, 2020 under ANB package for creating employment opportunities and sanitary infrastructure creation in order to have better, safe hygiene and sanitary practices during COVID-19. Under the PMGKRA, 29,695 Community Sanitary Complexes (CSCs) have been constructed so far. Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) 10.40 Government has accorded highest priority to improve the quality of life and enhance ease of living of people especially those living in rural areas by announcing the Jal Jeevan Mission (Box 8). At the time of roll out of the scheme in August 2019, about 3.23 crore (17 per cent) households out of total 18.93 crore rural households had tap water supply. Remaining 15.70 crore (83 per cent) rural households were to be provided with functional tap water connections (FTWC) by 2024. Box 8: Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) Goal of JJM is to enable every rural household get assured supply of potable piped water at a service level of 55 litres per capita per day (lpcd) regularly on long-term basis by ensuring functionality of the tap water connections To provide FTWC to every rural household by 2024 with a total outlay of ` 3.60 lakh crore in partnership with States. JJM is a decentralized, demand-driven and community-managed programme with the Gram Panchayat and/ or its sub-committee, i.e. Village Water and Sanitation Committee (VWSC)/ Paani Samiti/ User Group, etc. playing a key role in planning, implementation, management, operation and maintenance of water supply systems. JJM envisions empowering water supply department and local communities to function as water utilities for long-term water security in the country.358 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 Figure 15: Cumulative progress of FTWC coverage in Rural Households (in crore) 3.2 3.4 4.1 4.1 4.1 4.5 5.0 5.3 5.5 5.7 5.9 6.2 6.4 0.01.02.03.04.05.06.07.0 Launch of JJM Source: Department of Drinking Water & Sanitation, Ministry of Jal Shakti (as on 18.01.2021) 10.41 Keeping with 'no one is left out' principle, 18 districts in the country spread across Gujarat (5), Telangana (5), Himachal Pradesh (1), Jammu & Kashmir (2), Goa (2) and Punjab (3) have become 'Har Similarly, 402 Gaon', respectively. Goa has become first State in the country to have 100 per cent households with 'tap water connections i.e. 'Har Ghar Jal Rajya'. About 3.2 crore of rural households have been provided with FTWC since the launch of the Mission (Figure 15). RURAL DEVELOPMENT 10.42 The rural sector in India witnessed the phenomenon of reverse migration during the period of complete lockdown, with migrants availing all possible means of transport or even walking back kilometers to reach homes. But the eventual return of these migrants back to metropolitan cities would materialize only with the normalization of COVID-19 related stringencies. Despite such adversities, the resilience of the rural economy in tackling the COVID -19 related crisis was supported by a good crop season and stimulus packages of the Government. 10.43 The first of measures announced under the PMGKP in March, 2020 included cash transfers of upto ` 1000 in two installments of ` 500 each to the existing old aged, widowed and disabled beneficiaries under the National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP). An amount of ` 2814.50 crore was released to 2.82 crore NSAP beneficiaries. An amount of ` 500 each was transferred for three months digitally into bank accounts of the women beneficiaries in PM Jan Dhan Yojana, totaling about 20.64 crores. Free distribution of gas cylinders to about 8 crore families for three months was also undertaken. Limit of collateral free lending for 63 lakh women SHGs increased from ` 10 lakhs to ` 20 lakhs which would support 6.85 crore households. 10.44 In the second tranche of stimulus measures announced under ANB Abhiyan, an additional ` 40,000 crore was allocated for Mahatma Gandhi NREGS to help generate nearly 300 crore person-days to address the need for more work for the returning migrant workers as well as to take care of the monsoon season. A total of 311.92 crore person-days have been generated 359 Social Infrastructure, Employment and Human Development and a total of 65.09 lakh individual beneficiary works and 3.28 lakh water conversation related works have been completed in the current financial year as on 21st January 2021. Wages under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA was increased by ` 20 from ` 182 to ` 202 w.e.f. 1 st April, 2020, which would provide an additional amount of ` 2000 annually to a worker. Key elements and remarkable achievements of the scheme are given in the Box 9. Box 9: Key elements and remarkable achievements of MGNREGA The steps to strengthen the Mahatma Gandhi NREGA 'inter-alia' include electronic Fund Management System (eFMS), use of Aadhaar, Geo tagging of assets and strengthening of Social Audit System, implementation of Software for Estimate Calculation Using Rural rates for Employment (SECURE), Geographical Information System (GIS) based planning, Time and Motion Study (TMS) to increase efficiency of estimation of work, JanMANREGA- a mobile application system, eSaksham- a digital learning platform, Cluster Facilitation Project (CFP) to position thematic experts at all levels in selected blocks with poor implementation capacity and Project Unnati to upgrade the skill base of Mahatma Gandhi NREGA workers. 311.92 crore person-days generated in FY 2020-21 (as on 21.01.2021) which is an all-time high. Of the total person-days, person-days for women is 52.69 per cent, SC is 19.9 per cent and ST is 17.8 per cent which are well above the norms. Around 61 per cent of total works taken up during FY 2020-21 (as on 21.01.2021) pertain to individual beneficiary schemes and 68.37 per cent of the total expenditure is on agriculture and allied works. 4.24 crore Mahatma Gandhi NREGA assets geo-tagged and made available in the public domain. 99 per cent of wages paid electronically into the accounts of the Mahatma Gandhi NREGS workers during 2020-21 as against 37.17 per cent during 2013-14. Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) 10.45 DAY-NRLM seeks to alleviate rural poverty through building sustainable community institutions of the poor. The mission aims at mobilizing about 9-10 crore households into SHGs and link them to 'sustainable livelihoods opportunities by building their skills and enabling them to access formal sources of finance, entitlements and services from both public and private sectors. Cumulative progress (upto December 2020) shows that about 7.26 crore households have been mobilized into 66.03 lakh SHGs under the mission. In terms of capitalization support, the SHGs have been provided more than ` 12,195 crore cumulatively as Revolving Fund and Community Investment Fund from the Mission. As an integral approach to capacity building, the Mission has trained and deployed more than 3 lakh Community Resource Persons, who are providing support to the community institutions. DAY-NRLM has also been instrumental in providing the last mile delivery of financial services in remote rural areas through promotion of digital finance and deployment of SHG Women as Banking Correspondent Sakhi (BC Sakhi), with the support of banks and Common Centres. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) 10.46 PMGSY was launch ed on 25th December, 2000 with the objective to provide single all- weather road connectivity to all eligible unconnected habitations of the designated population 360 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 size (500+ in plain areas, 250+ in North-Eastern and Himalayan States) in rural areas of country. The PMGSY has completed two phases and third phase has been launched with the target allocation of 1.25 lakh km all-weather road connectivity. More than 6.44 lakh km road length has been constructed so far under the Scheme. The scheme has helped immensely in providing access to basic services and lifting the income of rural masses. Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyan (GKRA) 10.47 GKRA was launch ed on 20th June, 2020 for a period of 125 days with a focus on 25 works in 6 States. The Abhiyan was a convergent efforts between 12 different Central Ministries/Departments. The major objectives of the initiative include the provision of livelihood opportunities to returning migrants and similarly affected rural citizens, saturate villages with public infrastructure viz. roads, housing, anganwadis, panchayat bhavans, various livelihood assets and community complexes, among others and a basket of a wide variety of works. The programme was intended to enhance long term livelihood opportunities. To address the hardship of a large number of returnee migrant workers, district with a concentration of 25,000 and more returnee migrant workers were selected. The Abhiyan started with a resource envelope of ` 50,000 crore with estimated employment generation of 40.34 crore person-days from 20 th June, 2020 to 22nd October, 2020. The Abhiyan has helped in empowering villagers with livelihood opportunities in the selected 116 Districts of 6 States namely Bihar (32 districts), Jharkhand (3 districts), Madhya Pradesh (24 districts), Odisha (4 districts), Rajasthan (22 districts) and Uttar Pradesh (31 districts). The Abhiyan had achieved an employment generation of 50.78 crore persondays with a total expenditure incurred of ` 39,293 crore. In the pursuit of objectives of the Abhiyan, assets created are detailed in Box 10. Box 10: Public infrastructure and assets created under GKRA 1,59,697 Water conservation structures, 45,071 cattle shed, 4,848 Vermicomposting units, 2,854 Poultry Sheds, 34,005 farm ponds, 16,399 construction of wells 23,010 community sanitary had been taken up under PM-Grameen Sadakh Yojana 4,81,210 rural houses, 3,607 Anganwadi Centers 25,645 works related to solid and liquid waste management 17,240 W orks under Jal Jeevan Mission Works under Finance Commission fund of ` 5810.97 crore Works under PM Urja Ganga Project of ` 327.10 crore Construction and maintenance of a total of 7069 kilometers of road had been taken up under National Highway Authority 68,136 candidates have been provided skill training through Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) during the Abhiyan Laying of 92,158 kilometers Fiber Optic Cable under Bharat Net Works through District Mineral Fund of ` 1042.82 crore had been taken up361 Social Infrastructure, Employment and Human Development CONCLUSION 10.48 Investment in social infrastructure played a crucial role in India's economic growth. The government is committed to invest in social sector viz education, healthcare, skill development, providing employment opportunity, housing, sanitation etc in order to bring overall improvement in socio-economic indicators and achieving SDGs. Inspite of COVID-19 pandemic, public spending on social sector has increased in 2020-21 and efforts continued through Aatma path-breaking labour reforms etc. India's progress towards vibrant economy is deep-seated in investing in social capital. CHAPTER AT A GLANCE \u00beThe combined (Centre and States) social sector expenditure as per cent of GDP has increased in 2020-21 compared to last year . The increase also manifested as a proportion of the budgetary expenditure. \u00beIndia's rank in HDI 2019 was recorded 131 compared to 129 in 2018, out of a total 189 countries. By looking at the sub-component wise performance of HDI indicators, India's \"GNI per capita (2017 PPP $)\" has increased from US$ 6,427 in 2018 to US$ 6,681 in 2019, and \"life expectancy at birth\" has improved from 69.4 to 69.7 year, respectively, mean and expected years of schooling remained unchanged. \u00beOnline schooling took off in a big way during the COVID-19 pandemic. The access to data network, electronic devices such as computer, laptop, smart phone etc. gained in importance due to online learning and remote working. Innovative measures were adopted to bring all strata of the society under the medium of online/digital schooling. \u00beFormal skill training showed an improvement over the annual cycle of PLFS across all socio-economic classification including rural, urban and gender classification. \u00beYear 2018-19 was witnessed as a good year for employment generation. About 1.64 crore additional employment created during this period consisting of about 1.22 crore in rural area and 0.42 crore in urban area. Female LFPR increased to 18.6 per cent in 2018-19 from 17.6 per cent in 2017-18. \u00beThe quarterly survey of PLFS for the urban sector saw a major proportion of workforce engaged as regular wage/salaried during the period of January 2019-March 2020. \u00beGovernment has given incentive to boost employment under the scheme Atmanirbhar Bharat Rojgar Yojana. Existing Central labour laws have been rationalized and simplified into four Labour Codes viz. (i) the Code on Wages, 2019, (ii) the Industrial Relations Code, 2020, (iii) the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020 and (iv) the Code on Social Security, 2020 to bring these laws in tune with the changing labour market trends. 362 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 \u00beTime Use Survey, 2019 showed females spending disproportionately large time on unpaid domestic and caregiving services to household members compared to their male counterparts. This explains the reason for the relatively low level of female LFPR in India. There is a need to promote non-discriminatory practices at the workplace like pay and career progression, improve work incentives, including other medical and social security benefits for female workers. \u00beIn the fight against COVID-19, the initial measures of lockdown, social distancing, travel advisories, practicing hand wash, wearing masks reduced the spread of the disease. The country also acquired self-reliance in essential medicines, hand sanitizers, protective equipment including masks, PPE Kits, ventilators, COVID-19 testing and treatment facilities. The world's largest COVID-19 immunization program commenced on 16 th January, 2021 through two indigenously manufactured vaccines. \u00beNFHS-5 (Phase-I), results show improvement in immunization coverage for children, institutional birth, infant mortality rate and under-five mortality rate in most of the selected States. \u00beUnder PMGKP announced in March, 2020 cash transfers of upto ` 1000 in two installments of ` 500 each were paid to existing old aged, widowed and disabled beneficiaries under the National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP). An amount of ` 2814.50 crore was released to 2.82 crore NSAP beneficiaries. An amount of ` 500 each was transferred for three months digitally into bank accounts of the women beneficiaries in PM Jan Dhan Yojana, totaling about 20.64 crores.

The three Codes dealing with occupational safety, health and working condition, industrial relations and social security were notified on 29.09.2020, while the Code on Wages was notified on 08.08.2019. Through these labour codes the much needed labour welfare reforms have been introduced after years of holding many multi-stakeholders consultations with Trade Unions, Employers, Central Ministries/State Governments and experts of labour sector. Draft rules have been published in Gazette of India for inviting comments from public and stakeholders. The salient features of the Codes are as under: The Code on Wages, 2019: It amalgamates 4 wages and payment related labour laws viz; the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965 and the Equal Remuneration Act, 1976. The salient features of the Code on Wages include: i. A statutory right has been created for minimum wages and timely payment of wages to all workers whether in organized or unorganized sector. It extends entitlement of minimum wages to all the workers in the country as against 30 per cent of the workforce, at present. At present, minimum wages are fixed for employment covering mainly mines sector, plantation, dock workers, building and construction workers, watch and ward, sweeping and cleaning and manufacturing sector etc. Extension will take place to entire service sector (IT, hospitality, transportation etc.), domestic workers, unorganized workers, teachers etc. ii. Method of fixation of minimum wage rates simplified. Factors to be taken into account are types of skills and geographical location as against the present system of wage being fixed employment-wise. iii. Number of minimum wage rate would be around 200 in the entire country as against 10000, at present. iv. In central sphere, there would be only 12 minimum wage rates as against 542. v. Revision of minimum wages in every 5 years. vi. A statutory concept of 'Floor Wage' introduced. The Industrial Relations Code, 2020: The Industrial Relations Code (IR Code) has been prepared after amalgamating, simplifying and rationalizing the relevant provisions of (i) the Trade Unions Act, 1926; (ii) the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946 and (iii) the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The salient features of the Code include: i. The wage ceiling for the purposes of coverage of 'supervisor' as workers for grievance redressal has been increased to ` 18000/- per month from existing ` 10000/- per month under the Industrial Disputes Act. ii. The concept of fixed term employment (FTE) introduced which is a win-win situation where an employee gets all the benefits of a permanent employee and the employer can engage a worker without intervention of a contractor. A FTE worker will be entitled to all 365 Social Infrastructure, Employment and Human Development benefits like a permanent worker. Further, a FTE worker has also been allowed benefit of proportionate gratuity even if the contract is for a period of one year. iii. A \"Re-skilling Fund\" for training of retrenched employees has been setup from the contribution to be made by an industrial establishment for an amount equal to 15 days' wages for every worker retrenched. This is in addition to retrenchment compensation. The amount will be credited to the workers account within 45 days. iv. The Central and State Governments have been given flexibility to modify the retrenchment compensation which is at present 15 days per completed year of service to any number of days. v. A long pending dema nd of the trade unions to provide them statutory recognition has been considered by including a concept of 'Negotiating Union'. It will facilitate negotiation between employer and employees. If a trade union enjoys membership of more than 51 per cent of workers on muster roll, then it shall be recognized as negotiating union for negotiation with employer. If no single Trade Union has support of more than 51 per cent of workers, then a Negotiating Council will be constituted in an establishment for negotiation. Every trade union having 20 per cent or more membership will be eligible for a seat in the 'Negotiating Council'. vi. Similarly, a provision has been made to recognize trade unions, federation of trade union at Central and State level. vii. To facil itate ease of doing business, the Code removes requirement of prior permission of appropriate Government for seeking permission for lay-off, retrenchment and closure of a factory, mine and plantation having less than 300 workers. The benefits of notice period, retrenchment compensation, and pay in lieu of notice period have been retained. viii. Compounding of offences has been introduced. However, the benefit of compounding will be available only once in three years for an offence. The amount collected from compounding shall be used for welfare of workers in unorganized sector. ix. Two- Member Industrial Tribunal will help in speedy disposal of labour disputes. x. To facil itate crystalizing the rights of workers and also to promote ease of doing business, responsibility has been cast upon the Central Government to prepare model standing orders which will have standardized provisions relating to working hours, shifts, holidays, disciplinary proceeding and other service conditions. xi. Care has been taken that the rights of the workers are not compromised and to provide for easy, transparent and accountable compliance. The reduction and rationalization of definitions will reduce litigation, promote transparency and accountability . The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020: The Code has been drafted after amalgamation, simplification and rationalization of the relevant provisions of the 13 Central Labour Acts viz; the Factories Act, 1948, the Mines Act, 1952, the Plantation Labour Act, 1951, the Dock Workers (Safety, Health and Welfare) Act, 1986, the Building and other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996, the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act,1970, the Inter-State Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1979, the Working Journalists and other Newspaper Employees (Conditions of Service) and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 366 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 1955 the Motor Transport Workers Act, 1961, the Sales Promotion Employees (Conditions of Service) Act, 1976, the Beedi & Cigar Workers (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1966 and the Cine-workers and Cinema Theatre Workers (Regulation of Employment) Act, 1981. The salient features of the Code include: i. For electronic registration of establishments, uniform threshold of 10 employees has been fixed. One registration for an establishment has been envisaged in place of 6 registrations in the Acts. This will create a centralized database and promote ease of doing business. ii. An enabling provision has been made that the Central Government can extend applicability of this Code to any establishment, even if it has less than 10 employees, carrying out hazardous or life threatening occupations. iii. The Code rationalizes the compliance mechanism with one license, one registration and one return for the establishments. iv. The OSH Code expands the earlier definition of migrant worker given in the Inter-state Migrant Worker Act, 1979. The present OSH Code includes those workers who would be directly employed by the employer, besides by the contractor. Further, it has also been made possible that a migrant, who comes on his own, in the destination state, can declare himself a migrant worker by registering on an electronic portal on the basis of self-declaration seeded with Aadhaar. The registration on portal has been made simple and there is no requirement of any other document except Aadhaar. v. One of the primary reasons for non-availability of data for migrant worker was that the definition of inter-state migrant worker was restrictive. The Ministry of Labour & Employment in this regard has also taken steps to develop a national database to enroll unorganized workers including migrants, which will inter-alia help migrant workers get jobs, map their skills and provide other social security benefits. It will also help in better policy formulation for unorganized sector workers, in general. vi. The migrant workers will also be able to enjoy the benefits of portability in respect of ration and avail benefits from building & other construction cess fund. vii. Employer to provide free of cost annual health check-up for employees above the specified age working in certain type of establishments. viii. Issue of appointment letter has been made mandatory for all employees, covered under the Code which will promote formalization of employment. ix. The Code envisages employment of women in all establishments covering all types of works. Women are now entitled to work in the night, subject to their consent, with provisions of safety, holidays, working hours or any other condition as prescribed by appropriate Government. It promotes gender equality in a big way. x. The ambit of definition of 'working journalists' and 'cine worker' have been modified to include workers employed in electronic media and all forms of audio- visual production. xi. The courts have been enjoined upon that a part of the penalty amount for contravention of provisions relating to duties of employer leading to death or serious bodily injury to any person may be given to the victim or the legal heirs of the victim. 367 Social Infrastructure, Employment and Human Development xii. An all India license to contractor for five years has been provided in the Code as against work order based licensing at present. xiii. Enabling provision for constituting a bi-partite Safety Committee in any class of establishment by appropriate Government to promote safe and healthy working conditions in an establishment. Earlier, it was limited to establishments engaged in hazardous occupations. xiv. The multiple committees under five labour Acts have been substituted by one National Occupational Safety and Health Advisory Board which is of tripartite nature and has representation from trade unions, employer associations, and State governments. The Code on Social Security, 2020: The Code on Social Security subsumes existing nine Social Security Acts viz; the Employees' Provident Fund & Miscellaneous Provisions Act, the Employees' State Insurance Act, the Employees' Compensation Act, the Employment Exchanges (Compulsory Notification of Vacancies) Act, the Maternity Benefit Act, the Payment of Gratuity Act, the Cine Workers Welfare Fund Act, the Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Cess Act, and the Unorganized Workers' Social Security Act. The salient features of the code include: i. The coverage of Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) has been extended pan- India to all establishments employing 10 or more employees as against notified districts/areas. However, contribution from employers and employees will be collected from the notified date when the facilities are made available on the ground by ESIC. The benefits available under ESIC include medical, sickness, maternity, pension for dependents' and for disablement, etc. ii. The Code envisages extension of benefits to the employees working in establishments with less than 10 employees on voluntary basis and on mandatory basis through notification by the Central Government for employees working in hazardous industries. Further, ESIC coverage can also be extended to plantations on option exercised by the employer. iii. An enabling provision has been made to include self-employed and any other class of persons into the fold of social security coverage under EPFO and ESIC through formulation of schemes. iv. Under the EPF&MP Act, at present, no limitation period exists in commencing inquiry to assess the cases of non-payment of provident fund dues. A limitation period of 5 years for initiating of any proceeding has been introduced. Further, a transparent and predictable system of assessment of cases by EPFO officers has been introduced. v. A time limit of 2 years has been prescribed for completion of an inquiry by ESIC and EPFO, which may be extended for a further period of one year only. It will increase compliance and bring discipline in disposal of cases. vi. Self-certification/assessment by the employer has been introduced for assessment of cess payable in respect of Building and Other Construction Work. vii. An enabling provision has been made to notify differential rates of employees' contribution under EPF for class of employees, for a certain period to increase higher take home salary. However, the employers' contribution will remain unchanged. 368 Economic Survey 2020-21 V olume 2 viii. To cater to emerging new forms of employment, new definitions like of aggregator, gig worker , platform worker have been introduced. A small contribution from aggregator between one to two per cent of turnover subject to limit of five per cent payable to gig and platform workers has been introduced. ix. A Social Security Fund is proposed to be established to formulate schemes for social security to the workers of unorganised sector. The amount of the compounding of fines shall also become part of the Social Security Fund. Through this dedicated account of the Social Security Fund, the schemes would be formulated by the Central Government from time to time for benefit of these workers concerning their welfare on life & disability cover, health and old age benefits, etc. x. For the persons engaged in FTE, the proportionate benefit of service has been extended without requirement of minimum service of 5 years for gratuity. A person having a contract for one year under FTE will also be eligible for 15 days wages' as gratuity. xi. The definition of wages has been revised to bring clarity as to what constitute \"wages\" for the purpose of calculation of contribution for EPF and ESIC. xii.

The Inspector-cum-Facilitator has been introduced in the Code in place of Enforcement Officer, Inspector, Social Security Officer, etc. The responsibilities, inter-alia, would include imparting of advice to employers and workers for effective compliance of the provisions of Social Security Code. xvi. A web-based inspection scheme to allocate random inspections by centralized computer system has been introduced. The inspection scheme envisages assigning of unique number to inspector cum facilitator, to each establishment including each inspection to bring accountability and transparency. xvii.
