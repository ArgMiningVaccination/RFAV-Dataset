Below are some FAQs with the latest information that we know. As we learn more from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), we will continue to keep you updated. 1. Will the COVID -19 vaccine be mandatory for the state or for MHC employees? No, there is no plan at this time for the state or MHC to mandate that healthcare employees get a COVID19 vaccine. However, we are encouraging everyone to consider getting vaccinated wh en it is available to them. As key members of our Healthcare Team, you are a critical responder during this COVID -19 pandemic and a role model for others in the community for responsible behaviors that help stop the spread of the COVID -19 virus. 2. Is the vaccine safe? Munson Healthcare takes the safety of any vaccine very seriously. We will review the safety evidence for any potential vaccine and will review the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration, the Advisory Committee for Immunizatio n Practices (APIC) and the CDC before offering any vaccine to MHC employees. 3. How will MHC prioritize vaccinations among the Healthcare Team? For us in northern Michigan, it remains clear it will take time to vaccinate those who have been prioritized for the first doses. At the state level, a phased approach for vaccine allocation is being implemented. ALL healthcare workers are in the first phase of this plan (see below). State of Michigan Phased Plan for Vaccine Allocation Phase I - Limited Dose Availability - Focus on doses for highest risk populations a. Tier 1A: Healthcare Personnel and Long Term Care Residents b. Tier 1B: Essential Workers: People who play a key role in keeping essential functions of soc iety running and cannot socially distance in the workplace (e.g., Education Sector, Food & Agriculture, Utilities, Police, Firefighters, Corrections Officers, Transportation) and individuals 75 years of age and older. c. Tier 1C: Individuals 65 years of age and older, individuals aged 16 and older with underlying medical conditions, other essential workers. Phase II: Large Dose Availability - Focus on ensuring access to vaccine for all critical populations who we re not vaccinated in Phase 1, as well as for the general population. Phase III: Sufficient Dose Availability - Focus on ensuring equitable vaccination access across the entire population. While we roll out the vaccine program, it will be important for all of us to remain diligent about masking, social distancing, hand hygiene, and limiting social gatherings as we head into the holidays. We will continue to keep you upd ated as we learn more from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and MDHHS. 5. If I get a COVID -19 vaccine, will I still need to wear PPE? Yes, MHC Healthcare Team members will continue to use PPE after being vaccinated because it is just one of the tools we have to combat the virus. The vaccine, along with PPE, handwashing and soci al distancing will help us stop the spread of COVID -19. 6. What is the process for approving a COVID -19 vaccine and ensuring it is safe? According to the CDC, \"the federal government has been working since the start of the pandemic to make a COVID -19 vacc ine available as soon as possible. This accelerated timeline is unprecedented and has raised concerns for some people that safety may be sacrificed in favor of speed. However, as with all vaccines, safety is a top priority. COVID -19 vaccines were tested i n large, 3 phase clinical trials to make sure they meet safety standards. Many people were recruited to participate in these trials to see how the vaccines offers protection to people of different ages, races, and ethnicities, as well as those with differe nt medical conditions.\" After the clinical trials are complete: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) carefully reviews all safety data from clinical trials and authorizes emergency vaccine use only when the expected benefits outweigh potential risks. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) reviews all safety data before recommending any COVID -19 vaccine for use. Learn how ACIP makes vaccine recommendations. FDA and CDC will continue to monitor the safety of COVID -19 vaccines, to make sure even very rare side effects are identified. For more de tailed safety and efficacy information, click here . 7. What are the potential side effects of the vaccine? Most people do not have serious problems after being vaccinated. However, your arm may be sore, red, or warm to the touch after the vaccine. These symptoms usually go away within a week. There have also been reports of headache or fever after getting the vaccine. This is a sign that your immune system is working as it should. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has scientific -based informa tion on their website for further information. 8. What PPE will be worn at the vaccination clinics? All COVID -19 vaccinations will be given following standard infection prevention guidelines fo r administration of vaccines per MIOSHA standards. That includes sanitizing hands in between vaccinations and wearing proper PPE. In certain circumstances, such as a known bleeding disorder, those giving vaccinations may also wear gloves. 9. What if I have more questions? There is much public information available on the various COVID -19 vaccines. We encourage you to inform yourself before making your election.

Facts about COVID -19 Vaccines from the Center for Disease Control and Preven tion (CDC) FACT: COVID -19 vaccines will not give you COVID -19 None of the COVID -19 vaccines currently in development in the United States use the live virus that causes COVID -19. There are several different types of vaccines in development. However, the goal for each of them is to teach our imm une systems how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID -19. Sometimes this process can cause symptoms, such as fever. These symptoms are normal and are a sign that the body is building immunity. Learn more about how COVID -19 vaccines work . It typically takes a few week s for the body to build immunity after vaccination. That means it's possible a person could be infected with the virus that causes COVID -19 just before or just after vaccination and get sick. This is because the vaccine has not had enough time to provide p rotection. FACT: People who have gotten sick with COVID -19 may still benefit from getting vaccinated Due to the severe health risks associated with COVID -19 and the fact that re -infection with COVID -19 is possible, people may be advised to get a COVI D-19 vaccine even if they have been sick with COVID -19 before. At this time, experts do not know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID -19. The immunity someone gains from having an infection, called natural im munity, varies from person to person. Some early evidence suggests natural immunity may not last very long. We won't know how long immunity produced by vaccination lasts until we have a vaccine and more data on how well it works. Both natural immunity and vaccine -induced immunity are important aspects of COVID -19 that experts are trying to learn more about, and CDC will keep the public informed as new evidence becomes available.
