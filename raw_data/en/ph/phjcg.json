Yes, there is still hunger in America. But over the past 50 years, we have learned so much more about nutrition and the role that healthy eating plays in how our kids perform in the classroom and about nutrition and its linkages to disease prevention. This important conference and th e commitment to a national strategy on ending hunger and healthier eating will build on the research and knowledge we now have to make America truly a stronger, healthier nation. With this gathering of elected officials ; advocates and activists ; and lea ders of business, faith, and philanthropy from across America, we are mobilizing the will to meet a bold goal: to end hunger in America and increase healthy eating and physical activity by 2030 so fewer Americans experience diet - related diseases . This national strategy will serve as the playbook to meet this vital goal. It calls for a whole -of- government and whole -of-America approach to address ing the challenges we face. When families can't afford healthy food options, it's harder for children to succeed in school, and it can lead to mental and physical health challenges for the whole family. For so many families \u2014including families of color, those living in rural communities and territories, and low -income families \u2014structural inequality, such as disparities in educational and economic opportunities and lack of access to health care, safe housing, and transportation, make the impact of hunger and diet -related diseases even more severe. The pandemic made these problems worse, reinforcing the need f or urgent, sustained action. Despite the se challenges, we know what to do. This national strategy builds on the historic strides that my Administration has already made to bolster economic security for American families and cut child poverty across the c ountry. And i t harnesses our greatest resource \u2014our fellow Americans. Everyone has an important role to play in addressing these challenges: local, State, territory and Tribal government s; Congress; the private sector; civil society ; agricultural workers; philanthrop ists; academi cs; and of course, the Federal Government. In developing this national strategy, my Administration has listened to and learned from many remarkable advocates, including people who have experienced hunger and diet -related diseases themselves . To all of you, I am grateful for your unwavering commitment to meet this moment. Together , we can build a healthier future for all Americans.

WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 4 Executive Summary More than 50 years since the first White House Conference on Food, Nutrition, and Health, the U.S. has yet to end hunger and is facing an urgent, nutrition -related health crisis \u2014the rising prevalence of diet -related diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, hyperte nsion, and certain cancers. The consequences of food insecurity and diet -related diseases are significant, far reaching, and disproportionately impact historically underserved communities. Yet, food insecurity and diet -related diseases are largely preventa ble, if we prioritize the health of the nation. The Biden -Harris Administration envisions an America where no one wonders whether they will have enough money to put food on the table , where the healthy food choice is the easier choice , and where everyone has the same opportunity to be physically active. Transformative programs, policies, and system changes are needed within and outside government to achieve this vision. There is no silver bullet to address these complex issues , and there is no overnight fi x. Making progress requires collective, sustained action and mobiliz ation across every segment of society. That is why President Biden announced a goal of ending hunger and increasing healthy eating and physical activity by 2030 so fewer Americans experien ce diet -related diseases \u2014 while reducing related health disparities .1 To advance the President's goal \u2014and build on the federal government's existing work to address hunger and diet -related diseases \u2014this strategy identifies ambitious and achievable action s the Biden -Harris Administration will pursue across five pillars : 1. Improving food access and affordability , including by advancing economic security; increasing access to free and nourishing school meals ; providing Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) benefits to more children ; and expanding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP ) eligibility to more underserved populations; 2. Integrating nutrition and health , including by working with Congress to pilot coverage of medically tailored meals in Medicare; testing Medica id coverage of nutrition education and other nutrition supports using Medicaid section 1115 demonstration projects; and expanding Medicaid and Medicare beneficia ries' access to nutrition and obesity counseling; 3. Empowering all consumers to make and have access to healthy choices , including by proposing to develop a front -of-pack age labeling scheme for food packages ; proposing to updat e the nutrition criteria for the \"healthy\" claim on food package s; expanding incentiv es for fruits and vegetables in SNAP ; facilitating sodium reduction in the food supply by issuing longer -term, voluntary sodium targets for industry ; and assessing additional steps to reduce added sugar consumption, including potential voluntary targets ; 1 Ending hunger will be measured by a reduction in the number of households with insufficient food (defined as very low food security) to less than 1% of househo lds and cut the number of households struggling to put enough nutritious food on the table (defined as food insecurity) in half. WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 5 4. Supporting physical activity for all , including by expanding the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's (CDC) State Physical Activity and Nutriti on Program to all states and territories ; investing in efforts to connect people to parks and other outdoor spaces; and funding regular updates to and promotion of the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans ; and 5. Enhancing nutrition and food security re search , including by bolstering funding to improve metrics, data collection, and research to inform nutrition and food security policy, particularly on issues of equity and access ; and implementing a vision for advancing nutrition science. The federal gove rnment cannot end hunger and reduce diet -related diseases alone . The private sector ; state, Tribal, local, and territory governments; academia; and nonprofit and community groups must act as well. This strategy details Calls to Action for all these entities to do their part . Taken together, these collective efforts will make a difference and move us closer to achieving the 2030 goal. WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 6 Current Hunger, Nutrition, and Health Landscape Presiden t Biden has set out a goal of ending hunger and increasing healthy eating and physical activity by 2030 so fewer Americans experience diet -related diseases \u2014all while reducing health disparities. In 202 1, 1 in 10 households experienced food insecurity , mean ing their access to food was limited by lack of money or other resources .1 Nearly 4% of households in 202 1 experienced very low food security, meaning they were regularly skipping meals or reducing their intake because they could not afford more food.2 When someone experiences very low food security, they are most likely to also experience hunger.3 Moreover, diet -related diseases are some of the leading causes of death and disability in the U .S. New data show that 19 states and two territories have an obesity prevalence at or above 35%, more than doubl e the number of states from 2018 .4 One in 10 Americans have diabetes .5 One in 3 people will have cancer in t heir lifetime.6 And, m ore than 4 in 10 Americans have hypertension (high blood pressure) ,7 which is linked to the leading causes of death for Americans: heart disease and stroke.8 The toll of hunger and diet -related diseases is not distributed equally; these challenges disproportionately impact communities of color, people living in rural areas, people living in territories, people with disabilities, older adults , LGBTQI+ people, military families , and Veterans.9 Impacts of Insecurity & Diet-Related Diseases: Individual and Societ al Costs10 -19 pandemic exacerbated food insecurity , diet -related diseases, and health disparities. At the start of the pandemic in early 2020, the percentage of food insecure households with children reached 14.8%, up from 13.6% in 2019.11 This increase disrupted a decade -long downward trend.12 Devastatingly, diet -related diseases also increase the risk for severe symptoms and death from COVID -19. One study estimated that nearly two -thirds of WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 7 COVID -19 hospitalizations in the U.S. were related to obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and heart failure.13 Diet-related diseases are caused in part by poor eating patterns including excess calorie intake \u2014 and the failure to meet the Physical Activity Guidelines fo r Americans .14 The vast majority of Americans do not eat enough vegetables, fruit s, or whole grains and eat too much saturated fat, sodium, and added sugars.15 And, o nly 23% of Americans meet physical activity recommendations.16 Regular physical activity c an reduce the risk of heart disease and diabetes , help manage weight , strengthen bones and muscles , and improve people's ability to do everyday activities.17 However , a complex web of factors cause s food insecurity and contribute s to diet -related diseases and health disparities. Education and job opportunities ; access to health care, safe housing, and transportation ; and neighborhood design all affect an individual's ability to obtain food, make heal thy choices, and remain physical ly active. For example, people who live in communities without grocery stores offering affordable and healthy food options may face compounding challenges , particularly if they also do not have access to transit that allows them to travel to a n earby grocery store .18 Disparities in food insecurity and diet -related diseases exist in part because of persistent structural inequ ities. For example, people who lack access to food outlets that sell healthier foods tend to be lower -income, Black, or Hispanic ; live in rural areas ; and are geographically concentrated in the south.19 And, people living in territories, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians are highly dependent on food imports , leading to less access to healthy and affordable foods. Additionall y, children from low -income families typically have fewer opportunities to be physically active because of lesser access to safe streets and playgrounds.20 WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 8 The National Strat egy This strategy outlines the Biden -Harris Administration's plan to drive transformative change to end hunger and reduce diet -related disease s and disparities. By o utlining ambitious, achievable, and sustainable actions the federal government will take t o fundamentally shift the country's food, nutrition , and health policies across five pillars, this strategy create s a path to achieving our goals over the next decade. The federal government cannot make these transformative changes alone. Accelerating thi s work will require actions by state, Tribal , local, and territory governments; academia; civil society ; philanthropy ; the private sector ; and other partners . This strategy includes recommended steps these other sectors of society must take to reach our 2030 goal . Pillar 1 \u2014Improve Food Access and Affordability: End hunger by making it easier for everyone \u2014including individuals in urban, suburban, rural, and Tribal communities , and territories \u2014to access and afford food. A critical step to reduc e hunger and associated disparities is helping all Americans become economically secure. Toward this end, President Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan (ARP), whic h helped drive a historic and historically equitable jobs recovery.21 The expansion of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) through the ARP in 2021 helped cut child poverty nearly in half22\u2014driving it to record lows , including for all rac ial and ethnic groups measured \u2014 reduced food insecurity by roughly 26%,23 and led to the lowest share of households with children that were food insecure on record.24 The Administration has also partnered with Congress on historic legislation that will lower costs for American families \u2014including health care costs \u2014 so they do not need to make the choice between putting food on the table and covering other essential need s. The Biden -Harris Administration is committed to continuing progress in reducing food insecurity for American households by pushing for Congress to permanently extend the expanded , fully refunded CTC and expanded Earned Income Tax Credit. The Administra tion will continue to work with Congress to : raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour; close the Medicaid coverage gap ; invest in affordable, high-quality child care; and expand the Housing Choice Voucher program to ensure low -income families, older adults , and people with disabilities can afford decent, safe, accessible, and sanitary housing . The Biden -Harris Administration will continue to advance policies that increase worker power and workers' rights to collectively bargain \u2014including for the workers who gr ow, produce, and process our food, transport it to grocers, and stock grocery store shelves. Further , the Department of Defense (DoD) will implement the new Basic Needs Allowance created by Congress , which will ensure military households earn salaries suff icient to meet their basic food needs. Along with advancing policies that bolster families' economic security, b elow are additional steps the Biden -Harris Administration will pursue to improve food access and affordability. WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 9 A. Help more individuals experienc ing food insecurity benefit from federal assistance programs. Federal nutrition assistance programs such as t he Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and the Child Nutrition Programs , increase food security and well -being and help lift tens of millions of Americans out of poverty. The Biden -Harris Administration has taken pivotal steps to dramatically expand access to and strengthen these programs. For example, building on the ARP's temporary increase in SNAP benefits , the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Thrifty Food Plan update increased SNAP benefits by an average of $36.30 per person per month beginning in October 2021 . This SNAP benefit increase lift ed an estimated 2.3 million people out of poverty \u2014including nearly 1 million children, with a n even greater impact on children of color.25 Building on this progress , the Biden -Harris Administration will: Advance a pathway to free healthy school meals for all. Every school day across America, school meals provide critical nourishment to more than 30 million children. While school meals have demonstrated strong positive impacts on children's nutrition and other key outcomes, we have not yet fully leveraged school meals as a core intervention to improve child health or child hunger. A \"healthy meals for all\" approach would reorient the school meal programs from an ancillary service to an integral component of the sch ool day and allow schools to focus on providing the highest quality meals and engaging children around healthy food. Essential component s of this approach are expanding efforts to increase access to local and regional food systems, enabl ing more schools to cook meals from scratch by funding training and equipment purchases, invest ing in the school nutrition workforce, and expand ing nutrition education for children. Elevating school meals i s a key strategy to improve our nation's health and would benefit all children \u2014importantly, it would significantly strengthen the school meals program for those children who rely upon it the most. The Biden -Harris Administration will take a major first step by working with Congress to expand access to healthy, free school m eals for 9 million more children by 2032 . Expand Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) to more children . Food insecurity and weight gain increase during the summer months when children have limited access to school meals, particularly among Black and Latino children and children who are already at higher risk for obesity .26 Through the ARP's Summer Pandemic -EBT (P-EBT) program, over 36 million children received Summer P-EBT benefits in summer 2021 , and 43 states and territories are on track to provide Summer P- EBT benefits to an estimated over 32 million children in 2022. Summer -EBT decreases the prevalence of the most severe food insecurity among children and improves children's nutritional outcomes.27 The Biden -Harris Administration continue s to support an expansion of Summer -EBT so children can access nourishing meals when school is not in session. Expand SN AP eligibility to additional underserved populations. SNAP is a proven intervention to address food insecurity ; however , not everyone who has income low enough to qualify for the program is eligible. For example, f ederal law currently prohibits WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 10 many formerly incarcerated individuals \u2014a number of whom are parents of young children \u2014from accessing SNAP benefits, jeopardizing their health and mak ing it more likely they will struggle to successfully re -enter society and a void re -offending.28 This restriction disproportionately impacts Black individuals.29 The Biden -Harris Administration will work with Congress to eliminate this prohibition. In addition, the current two -tiered structure for nutrition assistance does not pro vide equitable benefits to the territories. The Administration supports granting territories the option to transition from current block grants to SNAP. Additionally, rather than reducing barriers to employment, research demonstrates that time limits on SN AP eligibility amplify existing inequities in food and economic security. And, SNAP's college student eligibility restrictions are out of date given the current population who seek higher education credentials, many of whom are older, have low income, and hold caregiving responsibilities. Other vulnerable populations such as youth who aged out of foster care and families providing kinship care, could also benefit from expanded access to nutrition benefits. The Biden -Harris Administration will work with Congress to expand access to this vital program. Increase funding for the Older Americans Act (OAA) nutrition programs. Older adults experience unique health, social , and nutrition challenges such as decreased mobility and limited shopping and cooking ability . The Biden -Harris Administration will work with Congress to increase funding for OAA nutrition programs, which play a vital role in helping older adults remain h ealthy and independent . Make it easier for eligible individuals to access federal food, human services, and health assistance programs such as SNAP, WIC, and Medicaid. Too often, people are eligible for federal assistance programs but do not benefit from them. To further facilitate participation in federal assistance programs: o USDA will work with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to help states identify individuals enrolled in one program who appear eligible for others but are not yet enrolled. For example, states could work to inform pregnant women and parents o f young children enrolled in Medicaid and/or SNAP but who are not participating in WIC about WIC services. o USDA will advance the WIC Modernization strategy to invest in community -based outreach, streamlin e the participant experience, improv e the in -store experience, expand access to farmer's markets, and increas e diversity and cultural competency in the WIC workforce. o USDA will partner with the Department of Education (ED), Social Security Administration (SSA), and other agencies to increase outreach and awareness of SNAP, including to eligible college students, older adults, and individuals with disabilities. For example, USDA and ED will establish a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to conduct joint outreach to Pell Grant recipients and others to inform them of their potential eligibility for SNAP benefits. o SSA is developing a rulemaking that would discontinue Supplemental Security Income ( SSI) benefit reductions based on the person's receipt of food as in -kind support and maintenance (ISM). No longer considering food for ISM is expected to generally result in a higher SSI payment for SSI recipients who receive food support from friends or famil y. WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 11 o HHS Administration on Children and Families (ACF) will support outreach to families that may be eligible for SNAP and nutrition programs, and share best practices to support their enrollment by developing research, training and tools for state and commu nity-based grantees of HHS ACF programs, including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Community Services Block Grant Program (CSBG). o HHS ACF will also issue a model application and guide to help states develop improved applications and ver ification processes for child care subsidies and encourage collaboration between state child care agencies and state agencies administering food and nutrition programs. Such early care and education programs are an essential source of healthy meals and ser vices that support the growth and wellbeing of young children. o HHS ACF will disseminate best practices on how partnerships between TANF charitable organizations and food banks can fill critical nutrition gaps for families. HHS ACF will also leverage training and technical assistance resources to highlight best practices in state and local use of TANF emergency short -term cash assistance to provide direct cash support for families experiencing acute food shortages. o The Department of Labor (DOL ) will collaborate with USDA to increase enrollment in SNAP by making referrals through DOL's American Job Centers. DOL will also disseminate best practices for how states should connect workforce and SNAP agencies to improve economic security for workers and communities. o The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will connect eligible Veterans with information and SNAP enrollment assistance through VA's Transition Assistance Program and screening at VA Medical Centers and clinics. o The Department of Housing an d Urban Development (HUD) will educate its grantees on nutrition assistance programs and provide resources to promote enrollment among HUD -assisted individuals. Modernize federal programs so enrolled individuals can more easily utilize benefits. Many feder al programs were established decades ago. To bring federal nutrition assistance programs into the 21st century: o USDA, through support from ARP funds, will expand online shopping in WIC . Online shopping is currently only being piloted in a small number of W IC state agencies . USDA will also propose to update regulations to make the SNAP online shopping program permanent and continue to add more online retailers and states to the existing program. Online shopping can expand access to healthy food and break down barriers for marginalized communities and older adults who may face discrimination or stigma, increased health risks, or have limited mobility or transportation. Additionally, SNAP participants are not currently able to use their benefits to pur chase certain prepared foods, which limits choices for families shopping at SNAP -authorized retailers. And, as WIC comes up for renewal by Congress, the Administration supports addressing WIC eligibility limitations to avoid nutrition gaps during key stage s of life. o DoD will provide clear and consistent labeling of WIC products in commissaries according to state agency program guidance. DoD will also provide beneficiaries with WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 12 online shopping and electronic payment as SNAP and WIC programs are brought onlin e. Support food sovereignty, improve access to traditional foods, and ensure Tribal communities are equitably served in federal programs. American Indians and Alaska Natives face some of the highest rates of diet -related disease in the U.S . Yet these popu lations continue to face barriers to accessing and implementing federal nutrition programs. USDA made significant commitments to support food sovereignty at the White House Tribal Nations Summit in 202 1.30 To further support Tribal food sovereignty: o USDA will continue to expand the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) Self -Determination projects , partner with Tribes on enhancements to the food package, expand the number of Indigenous and traditional foods in the Food Buying Guide for Ch ild Nutrition Programs, and provide training and resources to school meal program operators on incorporating more Indigenous and traditional foods into school meals. USDA will also improve staff recruitment and training to ensure its workforce has the know ledge and skills to serve American Indian and Alaska Native communities. o The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) will work to create Indigenous Food Hubs for selected BIE schools and BIA detention centers to help source Indigenous foods, enhance culturally -based healthy nutrition education, and boost training for healthy and culturally appropriate food preparation. For the first time, a nutritionist will be hired to support BIA and BIE in these efforts. o HHS ACF will update a nd expand its resource guide for Tribal communities to increase Tribes' knowledge of and access to HHS resources for food security and food sovereignty as well as physical activity. o HUD will promote the eligible uses of Indian Community Development Block Grant dollars to support expanding food access through the development of food banks and pantries, healthy eating habits, physical activities, and more in Tribal communities, particularly those with limited access to affordable and nutritious foods . B. Invest in community and economic development to increase access to food. Nearly 40 million Americans live in areas where grocery stores are not nearby .31 People with limited access to affordable, nutritious food tend to be lower -income and people of color. Even in communities where some retail food establishments exist, inadequate transportation and lack of affordable , healthy options contribute to food and nutrition insecurity. To further support business innovat ion and community and economic development with the greatest potential to advance food security , nutrition, and health, the Biden -Harris Administration will: Leverage housing and other community programs to increase food access. Strengthening food access through housing and community programs can help build broader well -being, particularly for children and families. o HUD will promote regulatory flexibilities that allow owners of HUD -assisted properties and Public Housing Authorities to use federal funds to renovate and maintain spaces in public housing developments to improve food access . WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 13 o HUD will, as appropriate, propose the use of Community Development Block Grants (CDBG), Section 108 loan program funding , and Choice Neighborhood funding to support food access, including to increase access to neighborhood markets, grocery stores, farmers' markets, urban gardens, food incubators, and/or the conversion of vacant buildings into food hubs, as well as case manag ement to help residents connect with health providers. HUD will also provide technical assistance to facilitate the use of HUD and other federal funding to finance the conversion of spaces into corner market stores and the development of grocery stores in areas with limited access to affordable and nutritious foods, develop case studies to highlight best practices and, with USDA, support the development of urban agriculture programs. o HHS ACF will issue guidance to help grant recipients maximize CSBG funds t o implement or scale anti -hunger efforts, including nutrition and prepared meal programs. HHS ACF will also develop communication materials to help grant recipients maximize CSBG, TANF, and Healthy Marriage and Responsible Fatherhood funds to strengthen an ti-hunger efforts; and develop a website that will disseminate case studies and best practices on anti -hunger and nutrition programs within the CSBG network. Improve transportation options to and from grocery stores, farmers' markets, and commercial distr icts. Improving transportation options to and from supermarkets, farmers' markets, and commercial districts increases a community's access to and options for healthy food. To support this: o The Department of Transportation (DOT), through implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) \u2014including programs such as Reconnecting Communities, Safe Streets for All, and the Neighborhood Access and Equity Grant Program \u2014will promote transit, bicycle, and pedestrian improvem ents, which would support food access solutions . o DOT , through technical assistance, will encourage communities to engag e with local and state public health experts in transportation planning and to prioritize connecting people to destinations with afforda ble and healthy food options. Increase historically underserved communities' access to affordable and healthy foods. Expanding food access requires sustained support and investment at the local level. To accomplish this: o The Federal Trade Commission (FTC ) has indicated that it will vigorously enforce antitrust laws with special attention to transactions and conduct that might lead to higher prices and reduced food access in vulnerable communities. FTC will also publish a report summarizing its study conclusions on how supply chain disruptions have affected wholesale and retail markets for groceries. Independent grocery stores are more common in underserved rural and urban communities and have raised concerns they were disproportionately affected by s uch disruptions . o The Small Business Administration (SBA) will give priority in ranking to applications by organizations that benefit food and nutrition businesses in the Growth Accelerator Fund Competition (GAFC) . GAFC supports the development and growth of small businesses and startup innovation ecosystems. WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 14 o The Department of Commerce (DOC) , through the Minority Business Development Agency's forthcoming Small Business Credit Initiative Technical Assistance notice of funding opportunity , will encourag e applications from incubators and accelerators that support market -driven solutions to provide greater equity or access to resources to underserved communities, including food security . o AmeriCorps will promote grant opportunities, national service , and volunteerism that address food insecurity and improve economic development in communities with critical need through its programs and special initiatives such as the AmeriCorps VISTA Food Security Initiative . o The Delta Regional Authority will implement priori tization criteria in its grant programs to support initiatives with a direct connection between economic development and healthy food access. Reduce barriers to food recovery. One-third of all food in the U.S. goes uneaten.32 To prevent food loss and wast e across the food supply chain and help ensure safe, good - quality food gets to those who need it most : o The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), USDA, and HHS Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are leading development of a whole -of-government strategy for reducing food loss and waste. o HHS FDA will update its Food Code \u2014which provides state, Tribal, local, and territory regulators with a model for up dating their food retail and service industry regulations \u2014to address food donation recommendations . o The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) will clarify the enhanced charitable deduction calculation to support businesses donat ing food. Improve access to emergency food , including during natural disasters. The network of emergency food providers across the country ha s shown its remarkable strength in recent years. The Biden -Harris Administration has taken significant steps to provide needed fundin g to the emergency food system , including awarding states nearly $ 40 million in ARP funds to expand the reach of The Federal Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) with $60 million in additional grants forthcoming. The Administration has also provided m ore than $2.5 billion in supplemental funding for emergency food purchases . Building on this progress: o USDA will pursue rulemaking to improve access and equity and simplify TEFAP requirements for state and local program operators. o USDA will work to understand and address gaps in meeting the needs of low -income individuals and families seeking cultural foods such as identifying options and expanding access to foods suitable for kosher and halal -observant communities , to better address the foodways of individuals served. o FEMA will provide technical assistance to its 10 regional offices and will direct all FEMA components and senior executive leaders to focus on ensuring food security during and after disasters. o FEMA will integrate food security as a priority planning area by partnering with USDA in conducting outreach to state, Tribal, local, and territory partners through regional and local engagements and working with federal partners to directly sup port disaster -specific planning and messaging. WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 15 o FEMA will use national and regional forums to provide and coordinate an opportunity for states and localities with robust food security plans to share best practices with other jurisdictions. WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 16 Call to Actio n for a Whole -of-Society Response States and territories should increase support to struggling families through TANF cash assistance, refundable state EITC and CTCs, and other economic supports for low -income families and individuals. States should wor k across state agencies to achieve 95% cross -enrollment of eligible people across SNAP, Medicaid, and other federal programs. And, states should aim to process all SNAP applications within one week. State and school districts should increase investment in school food programs such as providing investments to support kitchen infrastructure and training school nutrition professionals. State, local, and territory governments, private sector employers , and health care companies should ensure efficient community -clinical referral systems between hospitals and outpatient clinics with community -based services , including the OAA nutrition and health promotion programs, aging and disability resource centers, and Centers for Independent Living. State, local, and territory governments should provide incentives and technical assistance to attract healthier food retail outlets to underserved areas, improve healthier food offerings in existing stores, and suppor t year -round mobile produce markets in communities with limited food access. State, local, and territory governments should enact food waste reduction and recovery policies such as providing tax incentives to food donors. Philanthropy should support pi lots that foster collaboration between food service programs at K-12 schools and colleges or universities in order to synergize efforts around workforce training and food procurement. The private sector should invest in year -round mobile produce markets and retail outlets within underserved communities. WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 17 Pillar 2 \u2014Integrate Nutrition and Health: Prioritize the role of nutrition and food security in overall health \u2014including disease prevention and management \u2014and ensure that our health care system addresses the nutrition needs of all people. A. Provide greater access to nutrition services to better prevent, manage, and treat diet -related diseases. Receiving h ealth care to help prevent, treat, and manage diet -related diseases can optimize Americans' well -being and reduce health care costs. However, access to and coverage for this care varies significantly . To better care for all Americans, the Biden -Harris Administration will: Expand Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries' access to \"food is medicine \" interventions . \"Food is medicine \" interventions \u2014including medically tailored meals and groceries as well as produce prescription s (fruit and vegetable prescriptions or vouche rs provided by medical professionals for people with diet -related diseases or food insecurity) \u2014can effectively treat or prevent diet -related health conditions and reduce food insecurity.33 The Biden -Harris Admin istration supports legislation to create a pilot to test cover ing medically tailored meals for individuals in traditional Medicare who are experiencing diet -related health conditions. This proposal builds on a demonstration initiative in Medicaid, where HHS Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will provide authority for states to test Medicaid cover age of additional nutrition services , and supports using Medicaid section 1115 demonstration projects. HHS CMS will also issue guidance on how states can use section 1115 demonstrations to test the expansion of coverage for these interventions. Expand Medicaid beneficiaries' access to nutrition and obesity counseling. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires coverage of obes ity counseling for certain patients enrolled in most private group health plans and group and individual health insurance and certain beneficiaries among the 20 million people covered under the ACA's expansion of Medicaid . The Biden -Harris Administration supports expand ing nutrition and obesity counseling coverage to million s more Medicaid beneficiaries that currently are not guaranteed access to these services , particularly in states that have not expanded coverage and which have large rural populations. Expand Medicare beneficiaries' access to nutrition and obesity counseling. Medicare currently covers medical nutrition therapy services, including nutritional assessments and counseling , but only for people with diabetes or kidney disease , when ordered by a physician and performed by a dietitian . Medicare also covers obesity screenings and behavioral counseling to help patients with obesity lose weight, but only for patients with obesity and when performed by primary care clinicians in an office setting. The Biden - Harris Administration supports efforts to expand evidence -based nutrition and obesity counseling benefits to Medicare beneficiaries with additional conditions and to allow appropriate providers to offer obesity screening and behavioral counseling to help patients lose weight. HHS CMS will also examine existing Medicare authorities on ways to increase access to nutrition and obesity counseling. Additionally, HHS CMS will use WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 18 its provider education channels to increase awareness of Medicare coverage of nutrition and obesity counseling services . Increase access to nutrition -related services through private insurance and federal programs beyond Medicare and Medicaid. To further incre ase consistency in access to and coverage of quality health care services : o HHS CMS will solicit in formation from insurance plans regarding what nutrition services they already cover, with a goal of determining whether HHS CMS could strengthen essential hea lth benefit requirements or take other actions to expand private health coverage and better address the nutritional needs of Americans . o DOL, HHS, and Treasury will clarify how mental health parity protections apply to coverage related to nutritional counse ling for eating disorders to ensure that this coverage is not inappropriately being limited . o Treasury will issue guidance clarifying what nutrition and diet -related disease medical expenses can be reimbursed under health savings accounts and health flexible spending arrangements. o DoD will increase utilization of TRICARE 's Nutritional Therapy program to include preventive therapies and/or counseling beyond just those addressi ng certain diseases and conditions . o HHS Indian Health Services (IHS) will implement and evaluate a National Produce Prescription Pilot Program. o VA will implement and evaluate various food programs, including produce prescription programs, food pantries, an d mobile food pantries that meet local needs and Veteran preferences. Better support prevention and management of diabetes. To help address growing rates of diabetes : o HHS CMS will develop a strategy to increase access to diabetes prevent ion and treatment services for individuals with Medicare, Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and Marketplace coverage. The Administration will also work with Congress to make the Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program a cost- effective permanent Me dicare preventive service benefit. o HHS CDC will provide new funding opportunities to support the implementation of evidence -based diabetes prevention and management strategies in state and localities , with a focus on re ducing health disparities. Support wellness and nutritional care for children, especially those from low -income families. HHS CDC will continue to support and expand access to the evidence -based Family Healthy Weight Program s (FHWP) through at least three new upcoming funding opportunities. FHWP supports children and their families with low income and lifestyle and behavioral changes to improve nutrition, physical activity, stress, coping , and other aspects of wellness. Additionally, HHS Administration for Community Living ( ACL ) will share p romising practices from its University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities to help children with disabilities who require support for healthy eating. The Administration also recognizes that for children and adults with digestive and inherited metabolic disorders, ensuring access to the right types of nutritional supports , such as infant formula, can prevent hospitalizations and be WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 19 lifesaving . Still, there are often systematic barriers making access to these specialized nutritional sup ports challenging. CMS will evaluate coding, payment and administrative requirements in order to support access to nutritional supports for individuals with digestive and inherited metabolic disorders. B. Screen for food insecurity and connect people to the s ervices they need. Social determinants of health ( SDOH ) can be a strong predictor of health outcomes and are a major driver of health disparities .34 Incorporating SDOH such as food insecurity screenings, into health care can help practitioners better recognize the root causes that affect health, tailor care to unique individual needs, and connect patients to resources like SNAP, WIC, or a local food bank. However, food insecurity screenings are not universally conducted in the health care system , and most health care professionals have not been trained to assess it. To more fully incorporate SDOH , including food insecurity screenings and referrals , into everyday health care, the Biden -Harris Administration will: Universally screen for food insecurity in federal health care systems . Building on VA's existing universal food insecurity screenings: o HHS IHS will implement a process to assess for food insecurity in the IHS user community and conduct referrals as needed . o DoD will screen all active -duty military for food insecurity and conduct referrals as needed. o HHS CMS , building on its adoption of quality measures that capture if hospitals are screening for social needs, will explore incorporating quality measures relating to screening for social need s as part of the Medicare Shared Savings Program and Medicare Advantage Star Ratings Program. o HHS ACL will work with Centers for Independent Living and Protection and Advocacy Systems to pilot screening for food insecurity amongst people with disabilities. Incentivize payors and providers to screen for food insecurity and other SDOH. To accelerate the work HHS CMS outlined in its Framework for Health Equity : o HHS CMS has proposed to create new advance investment payments for certain n ew Medicare Shared Savings Program Accountable Care Organizations (ACO). ACOs would be permitted to use these payments to address social needs of beneficiaries, including working with local community -based organizations to address food insecurity. o HHS CMS will evaluate develop ing appropriate procedure codes to better capture services that address SDOH, including screening for food insecurity. If developed, these procedure codes could help organizations offering nutrition services more easily partner with h ealth care providers . o HHS CMS will consider extend ing the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation's Medicare Advantage Value -Based Insurance Design (VBID) model beyond 2024 and will explore expand ing its focus on supplemental benefits related to food a nd nutrition. HHS CMS will also consider broaden ing access to the model and encourag ing additional Medicare Advantage Organizations to provide food and WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 20 nutrition services in their offerings under the Special Supplemental Benefits for the Chronically Ill. Supporting data infrastructure for food insecurity and other SDOH screenings. HHS CMS will continue to support efforts to develop the data infrastructure needed for food insecurity and other SDOH data elements to be captured in electronic health records and ensure interoperable health information exchange and the collection of demographic information. In addition, HHS Office of National Coordinator for Health Information Technology will promote greater adoption and use of new versions of the United States Core Data for Interoperability , which include SDOH data elements to represent SDOH assessments, problems and health concerns, and goals and interventions that can support areas such as food insecurity. Incentivize hospitals to provide servi ces focused on food insecurity and other SDOH. The Internal Revenue Service will clarify that a non -profit hospital's spending on SDOH to address a documented community health need may meet the definitions of community benefit activities or community build ing activities. For example, a hospital may support food banks and pantries, conduct food insecurity screenings, fund or lead food and nutrition classes, or create a garden providing produce donations to food banks or pantries as part of its tax -exempt act ivities . Comprehensively address food insecurity among Veterans. VA will establish a new Office of Food Security within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to tackle the food insecurity rate among Veterans. The Office will provide strategic guidance a nd coordination within VHA, including VA hospitals and clinics, on best practices, research , and data to ensure Veterans' food security. In addition, VA will expand by 10% the amount of clinical nutrition services it provides to Veterans receiving care in the VHA. C. Strengthen and diversify the nutrition workforce. The health care workforce, including registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs), plays a central role in prevent ing, treat ing, and manag ing diet-related diseases. However, patients are less lik ely to seek care or share information if they perceive ethnic or social differences with their health care provider s.35 Thus , a more diverse health care workforce would better serve communities of color , which suffer from higher rates of food insecurity and diet -related disease. To expand and create a more diverse workforce well -trained in nutrition , the Biden -Harris Administration will: Bolster the health care workforce, including nutrition professionals, and ensure other medical professionals receive nutrition education. Currently, 70 % of RDNs are White. Only 6 % of RDNs indicate Hispanic or Latino heritage , 6% indicate being Asian, 3% indicate being Black , and 1% indicate being Indian or Alaska Native .36 Increasing the diversity o f RDNs and expanding their reach to areas with limited care will ensure more equitable care for everyone. o HHS Health Resources and Services Administration, through its Maternal and Child Health Nutrition Training Program, will train over 4,500 future nutr ition professionals and over 30,000 practicing professionals over the next five years on key topics such as pediatric obesity prevention, household food security, and nutrition during pregnancy. Beginning in 2023, the program will partner with Minority Ser ving WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 21 Institutions (MSIs) and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to recruit and train nutrition professionals from underrepresented groups. o VA will develop pilots for SkillB ridge to facilitate hiring of transitioning service members into VA Nutrition and Food Services positions . VA Nutrition and Food Services will partner with the Military Spouses Employment Program to facilitate hiring of military spouses into these positions . Additionally, VA will conduct a pilot for professional development of food service workers to encourage recruitment and retention for those positions . o VA will expand internship and rotation opportunities for dietetic interns and assess revision s to the Qualification Standard for Dietitians to increase the number of opportunities for internship direc tors. o USDA will work with Land -Grant Universities to develop a national workforce strategy for WIC, which could help shape the integration of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility principles across the broader nutrition education workforce . Call to Action for a Whole -of-Society Response States should leverage all available federal authorities to expand coverage of \"food is medicine \" interventions. States should collaborate with non -profit or community -based organizations to establish a state - funded produce prescription program for low -income individuals and families. State, local, and territory governments should integrate nutrition experts into their health departments and modernize scope of practice laws, as applicable, to allow qualifie d health care professionals to play a larger role in disease prevention and management efforts. Health insurance companies should consider provid ing or expand ing coverage of nutrition services, including produce prescriptions and/or medically tailored meals for target populations. Hospitals, clinics, and health centers should implement programs leveraging federally supported open industry technology standards that address SDOH such as screening patients for food insecurity, connecting patien ts to nutrition assistance services, and ensuring services are available. Health professional schools (e.g., medical, dental, pharmacy, nursing, social work, public health, physician's assistants, physiology, exercise science, etc.) and licensing boards should expand nutrition education in graduate medical education curriculums , board exams , and post - graduate training . WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 22 Pillar 3 \u2014Empower All Consumers to Make and Have Access to Healthy Choices: Foster environments that enable all people to easily make in formed , healthy choices, increase access to healthy food, encourage healthy workplace and school policies, and invest in public education campaigns that are culturally appropriate and resonate with specific communities. A. Empower consumers with updated and more accessible food labeling. Food labels help consumers identify healthy foods when grocery shopping. Most consumers are familiar with the iconic Nutrition Facts label , which the FDA recently update d with a refreshed design and additional information s uch as added sugars.37 But, consumers may not always understand information on food labels or have access to it when shopping online . To empower consumers to make healthy choices, the Biden -Harris Administration will: Develop a front -of-package (FOP) labeling system to quickly and easily communicate nutrition information. FOP labeling systems \u2014such as star ratings or traffic light schemes \u2014can promote equitable access to nutrition information and healthier choices and cou ld also prompt industry to reformulate foods to be healthier .38 HHS FDA will conduct research and propose develop ing a standardized FOP labeling system for food packages to help consumers, particularly those with lower nutrition literacy, quickly and easil y identify foods that are part of a healthy eating pattern . Make sure that foods labeled as \"healthy\" align with current nutrition science and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans . HHS FDA will propose updat ing the nutrition standards for when companies use the \"healthy\" claim on their products and develop a symbol companies may use to depict the \"healthy\" claim o n food packages. HHS FDA will also develop guidance for industry on the use of Dietary Guidance Statements on food labels to help people understand how a food or food group can contribute to a healthy eating pattern . Adequately fund HHS FDA's Center for Food Safety and App lied Nutrition (CFSAN) to prioritize its nutrition and labeling work. HHS FDA's CFSAN nutrition work has historically been underfunded in comparison to other priority areas. To date, only 7% of CFSAN's budget supports nutrition and labeling work , yet CFSAN is responsible for the safety and labeling of approximately 80 % of the U.S. food supply. The Biden -Harris Administration will work with Congress to ensure CFSAN has the resources it needs to accomplish its critical work. Facilitate making nutrition inform ation easily available when grocery shopping online. While c onsumers increasingly us e e-commerce to shop for groceries , nutrition information is not uniformly presented or always made easily accessible . HHS FDA will publish a request for information to gat her public input regarding industry practice s, technology, and current challenges to inform guidance for the food industry on nutrition, ingredient, and allergen information that should be available for groceries sold online. WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 23 B. Create healthier food environments and a healthier food supply so the healthier choice is the easier choice. A key barrier to healthy eating is lack of access to nutritious food. The food environment (e.g., proximity to stores, food prices, available food options) influences a person's food choices and diet quality. The U.S. food supply contains an overabundance of sodium, added sugar, and saturated fat . Americans who want to consume less sodium, added sugar s, and saturated fat may have a difficult time doing so because of poor availability of healthy alternatives .39 Recognizing the power of creating healthier food environments, the Biden -Harris Administration will: Expand incentives for fruits and vegetables in SNAP. Incentives in SNAP to support purchasing more fruits and vegetables have been pilot tested and shown to be effective in Massachusetts and through the USDA Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program . To increase access to fruits and vegetables for SNAP recipients, the Biden -Harris Administration will work with Congress to increase the reach and impact of incentives for fruits and vegetables in SNAP. Facilitate lowering the sodium content of food. In 2021, HHS FDA issued voluntary, short -term (2.5 -year) sodium reduction targets for a broad range of processed, packaged , and prepared foods to help reduce the amount of sodium in the U.S. food supply.40 To further lower sodium consumption: o HHS FDA will issue revised, voluntary sodium reduction targets to facilitate continually lower ing the amount of sodium in the food supply beyond the 2021 targets . o HHS FDA will propose to update reg ulations to enable manufacturers to use salt substitutes in standardized foods to support sodium reduction . o VA will increase lower-sodium foods with regards to procurement . o HHS ACL and FDA will partner to provide technical assistance to help align older adult nutrition programs with HHS FDA's voluntary sodium targets. o USDA will continue work to reduce sodium in school meals consistent with the go als of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and HHS FDA's voluntary sodium targets. Facilitate lowering added sugar consumption. The U.S. has reduced added sugar consumption and establish ed a regulatory definition for added sugars . Since 2021 , added sugars must be declared on the Nutrition Facts label for most products. Despite this progress, intake of added sugars is still too high for most Americans. HHS FDA will begin assessing the eviden ce base for further strategies to reduce added sugar consumption , collaborating with other HHS divisions and USDA to hold a public meeting regarding future steps the federal government could take to reduce intake of added sugars such as developing targets for categories of foods, similar to the voluntary targets FDA develop ed for sodium. Expand access to health ier environments in federal facilities. Implementing and updating the Federal Food Service Guidelines in federal facilities will promot e fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low -fat dairy, and low sodium options ; increase the availability of healthy beverage choices as well as plant -based options ; and encourage healthy choices through behavioral design. Millions of federal employees and other people who access government facilities \u2014from National Parks to VA hospitals \u2014will benefit. To WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 24 further support healthy environments, DoD will work with CDC to enhance nutrition and physical activity standards in all DoD child development programs . The General Services Administration (GSA) will promote nutrition and physical activity at its child care centers and DoD will also increase healthy options served in its dining facilities and vending machines, including expanding its Go 4 Green program (joi nt-service performance - nutrition initiative that improves where military service members live and work). Address marketing of unhealthy foods and beverages. Food, beverage, and restaurant companies spend nearly $14 billion per year on marketing in the U.S. More than 80% of this advertising promot es fast food, sugary drinks, candy, and unhealthy snacks that are high in sodium, added sugars, and/or saturated fat.41 Companies also use a wide variety of highly effective techniques to target sales of unhealthy f oods to adolescents and children, particularly Black and Hispanic children .42 The Administration will pursue steps to address the marketing of unhealthy foods , including: o DoD will limit marketing in military dining facilities to those that meet its Go 4 Green program nutrition standards. o The FTC has indicated that it will pursue targeted law enforcement actions to prevent the deceptive advertising of foods and dietary supplements, including deceptive advertising that might be targeted to youth. Leverage federal nutrition assistance programs to promote healthy habits. USDA's Child Nutrition Programs and WIC can help increase diet quality of beneficiaries and spur companies to reformulat e food products. To further this work: o USDA will propose updat ing the package of foods offered by WIC and the nutrition standards in school meals to better align with the most rec ent Dietary Guidelines for Americans and p rovide enhanced technical assistance and best practices to support schools in meeting the standards . Building on the success of the ARP's temporary increase, through appropriations, USDA will also continue providing the cash value benefit in WIC at a level that supports fruit and vegetable access and recommended consumption. o USDA will advance a new Healthy Meals Incentive initiative \u2014supported by ARP funding \u2014to support schools' efforts to impro ve the nutritional quality of school meals. This initiative will challenge all players within the K -12 food supply chain to increase the availability of and access to healthy offerings , recognize School Food Authorities (SFAs) that are innovating in offer ing nutritious school meals , and provid e funding to small and/or rural SFAs to improve the nutritional content of meals offered through the Child Nutrition Programs . o USDA will update nutrition criteria in USDA Foods procurement specifications to align with HHS FDA's voluntary sodium targets and consider the inclusion of added sugars limits. Additionally, USDA will work to ensure that food served in the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) and the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) aligns with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans wherever feasible. Create healthier food retail , restaurant , and colleg e campus environments. Modifying the food environment to increase the availability of healthy foods can improve people 's eating patterns.43 WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 25 o The Administration will work with Congress to remove the appropriations rider currently barring USDA from setting s tronger standards for SNAP retailers to stock a variety of healthy foods as a basic requirement to participate as a SNAP store. o HHS ACL will issue an OAA nutrition program -restaurant partnership best practices report. These partnerships enhance the nutritional quality of restaurant offerings, as meals served in OAA programs must align with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans . o ED will send a Dear Colleague Letter encouraging higher education institutions to be conscientious about nutrition. ED will use the letter to call on institutions to procure healthier foods and encourage them to use ARP funds for food pantries. ED will also encourage institutions to w ork with community organizations to provide services to students and promote nutrition security by showcasing best practices and examples from the field. Increase access to local food to better connect people to nutritious foods. Sourcing local foods can h elp increase consumption of fruits , vegetables , and other under consumed foods , improve attitudes about healthy eating, and support local economies. o HUD and USDA will cross -promote their programs to the owners of HUD -assisted properties and incentivize Public Housing Authorities to implement urban agriculture projects , food banks, and summer meal programs in affordable housing developments . o USDA will partner with EPA to provide technical assistance to their Local Foods, Local Places recipients to help cities and towns as they develop local food systems . o USDA will establish Regional Food Business Centers to support local food business growth, particularly in support of underserved communities including in Appalachia, Coloni as, and the Mississipp i Delta and throughout Tribal communities. o USDA will work to strengthen and diversify the suppliers that provide healthy, nutritious, and local foods to schools and nutrition assistance programs by assisting small and underserved farmers and businesses to become vendors for school meals . o USDA will make investments to support local and regional food and farm businesses through grants and other financial assistance for food hubs, distribution, and processing as well as technical assistance particularly in s upport of underserved communities to provide nutritious food to schools, food banks, and other nutrition assistance programs. o The Appalachian Regional Commission will work with USDA to improve access to federal funding in Appalachian communities seeking to enhance access to local food s. o The Northern Border Regional Commission will provide guidance for grantmaking to support access to locally produce d foods through its State Economic & Infrastructure Development Program . o DoD and VA will expand their procurement of local foods for military and Veteran s' care facilities . o The Bureau of Prison s (BOP) will partner with USDA to increase procurement of local foods in federal prisons . BOP will also identify additional facilities that could support garden ing programs where incarcerated people grow and harvest produce that is donated to local food ban ks. WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 26 Expand breastfeeding support and counseling for mothers . Parents who choose to breastfeed continue to face substantial barriers in sustaining this choice , including inconsistent hospital practices, lack of insurance coverage, and inadequate access to paid parental leave . Building on the Biden -Harris Administration's Maternal Health Blueprint : o USDA is testing telehealth initiatives to facilitate virtual breastfeeding support and one-on-one counseling in WIC. USDA will also disseminate results and key findings from an evaluation of a national breastfeeding suppo rt campaign it is conducting in partnership with the University of Nevada, Reno. USDA will also translate training materials and the WIC Breastfeeding Support website into Spanish. o HHS will lead the second phase of the Reducing Disparities in Breastfeedin g Challenge, which awards successful programs that have proven outcomes to improve breastfeeding rates and reduce disparities. o HHS and DOL will work to ensure that the ACA requirements for coverage of breastfeeding support and counseling without cost sha ring in most private health insurance plans and Medicaid are fully implemented and enforced . o DOL will take steps to ensure nursing workers and their employers are aware of and understand their rights and responsibilities through a series of online webinars at the national level , followed by locally focused webinars to reach workers, advocates, and employers throughout the country. o The Biden -Harris Administration will continue to support extending workplace protections to breastfeeding mothers. C. Support robust and tailored nutrition education. Consumers often hear conflicting food messages and U.S. adults generally overrate the quality of their diet ,44 suggesting that additional work is needed to e nsure adults are empowered to eat healthy foods . To bolster nutrition education, the Biden -Harris Administration will: Support regular updates to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and carry out a national education campaign. The Dietary Guidelines for Ameri cans is the cornerstone of all federal nutrition programs and policies, providing science -based recommendations for healthy eating. The Biden -Harris Administration will work with Congress to provide adequate f unding for HHS to regularly update these guidel ines, in partnership with USDA, and lead a national education campaign to boost awareness of healthy eating recommendations and support all Americans in making healthy choices . Develop tailored nutrition education. Education related to healthy eating is even more effective when it is grounded in cultural understanding. Building on currently available tailored education materials: o USDA will develop MyPlate nutrition education materials that are culturally appropriate and translated into a variety of languages . o USDA will work with Tribal leaders to expand nutrition education services and programs in FDPIR . o HHS ACL's Nutrition and Aging Resource Center will greatly expand ready -to-use, virtual , and in -person nutrition education for older adults. WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 27 o HHS FDA will develop messag ing and materials about its food labeling efforts that are tailored and disseminated appropriately for various audiences. o HHS ACF, in consultation with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and Office of the Assistant Secretary for He alth, will integrate nutrition counseling and access into direct service grant programs for victims of human trafficking, including integrating nutrition into national virtual training . o BOP will support the health of inmates and their families by adding a curriculum module to address dietary needs for vulnerable populations in its Culinary Arts vocational program; develop Life Skills Laboratories to teach balanced nutrition, healthy eating, and hands -on food preparation skills to individuals who have cognit ive or physical impair ments ; develop a new standardized wellness program; develop resources focused on health and nutrition to provide to children while they wait to enter visitation ; and expand its annual health fairs to reach a larger audience. Leverage SNAP -Ed to promote healthy foods. Many state SNAP -Ed programs use advertisements or social marketing to promote healthy foods and beverages. To leverage this resource, USDA will promote MyPlate's Shop Simple digital tool to assist users in finding healthy and affordable foods . USDA will also refresh and expand SNAP -Ed Connection, a database of nutrition education and physical activity resources . Call to Action for a Whole -of-Society Response States should provide nutrition incentives to SNAP parti cipants to purchase healthy food such as increasing the purchasing power of SNAP beneficiaries at farmers markets , and encourage retailers to market more nutritious food in store and online. State, local, and territory governments should adopt federal f ood service guidelines in their municipal buildings and advance measures to prohibit coupons or sales of unhealthy foods and beverages. States and localities should adopt early care and education licensing regulations that require minimum nutrition and p hysical activity standards that all licensed child care providers follow, regardless of program participation , and ensure early education and care workers are paid an adequate wage . States, localities, and K -12 schools should consider incorporating culi nary arts and nutrition education into schools. OAA nutrition programs and Centers for Independent Living should expand creative service models by partnering with restaurants, grocery stores, food trucks, and local farmers to promote nutritious meals an d use of locally -sourced foods. Colleges and universities should update their procurement contracts to ensure healthier foods are available in dining halls, including through sourcing local foods. Philanthropy should support pilots in underserved comm unities \u2014including Tribal communities, rural , and Native Hawaiian communities \u2014that boost local food systems as an WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 28 economic driver in communities by fostering connections between farmers who are growing culturally appropriate food, food vendors, institutions , and community organizations. The food industry should increase the availability of and access to foods that are low in sodium and added sugars \u2014including foods meeting or exceeding FDA's voluntary sodium reduction targets \u2014and high in whole grains, parti cularly for the K -12 market. Food retailers should hire RDNs to help provide nutrition information to consumers, redesign stores to more prominently place healthier choices, market and stock healthier items, and establish buying programs with local farms. Online grocery companies should redesign their search algorithms to ensure healthier products appear first and include ingredient and Nutrition Facts label information in an accessible manner for all food products sold online. Pillar 4 \u2014Support Phy sical Activity for All: Make it easier for people to be more physically active \u2014in part by ensuring that everyone has access to safe places to be active \u2014increase awareness of the benefits of physical activity, and conduct research on and measure physical ac tivity. A. Build environments that promote physical activity. One of the most impactful ways that people of all ages can improve their health is by being more physically active . Yet, the vast majority of Americans do not meet the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans .45 Personal efforts to be physically active can be made easier or harder by the surrounding environment. For example, individuals may not know about or have access to, safe places to be physically active, or have chronic conditions or physical limitations that create additional barriers. To make physical activity easier for all, the Biden -Harris Administration will: Expand HHS CDC's State Physical Activity and Nutrition Programs (SPAN) to all states and territories to implement successful state and community -level policies and activities for physical activity. Through SPAN, HHS CDC works with states to implement evidence -based strategies to reduce chronic disease by impr oving physical activity and nutrition. In particular, through SPAN, the Active People, Healthy Nation initiative make s physical activity safe and accessible for all by implementing state and community -level policies and activities that connect pedestrian, bicycle, or transit opportunities to everyday destinations . However, HHS CDC currently only has funding to deploy SPAN in 16 states. The Biden -Harris Administration will work with Congress to provide additional funding to expand SPAN nationwide. Connect more people to parks, particularly in nature -deprived communities. People who have access to green environments such as parks and trails, tend to walk and be more physically active than those with limited access. But, less than half of people in th e U.S. live within half a mile of a park.46 As part of the President's America the Beautiful Initiative , the Biden -Harris Administration is working to create more parks, open spaces, and safe outdoor opportunities in nature -deprived communities. As part of this effort: WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 29 o The Biden -Harris Administration will work to expand the National Park Service's (NPS) efforts to identify places where municipal transit or alternative modes of transportation are unavailable between parks and nearby underserved or disadvant aged communities. In partnership with DOT, NPS will deploy existing tools that improve trip planning and convenient connections to promote car -free travel to parks . This work will focus on lower -income, diverse , and underserved communities. o Federal agenci es, including DOT , Department of Interior (DOI) , and EPA, will sign a Nature -Deprived MOU to collaborate on work to reduce the number of people without access to parks and nature in their communities. o The Federal Interagency Council on Outdoor Recreation will work to increase access to national public lands, including through the Every Kid Outdoors (EKO) program. EKO provides fourth -grade students and their families , free one-year admission passes to over 2,000 federal lands and waters . Promote active transportation and land use policies to support physical activity. Active transportation \u2014such as walking and biking \u2014is one of the leading strategies to increase physical activity.47 Communities and transportation systems can be designed to make acti ve transportation safer and more enjoyable. Through BIL, the Biden -Harris Administration is improving transportation \u2014including active transportation \u2014for communities that have faced disinvestment in infrastructure. Additionally, the IRA established a new Neighborhood Access and Equity Grant Program that will fund projects to restore walkability and access , including to parks, in historically disadvantaged communities. Building on this work: o DOT will provide additional technical support a nd guidance for regional and local transportation agencies, transit authorities, industry, non -profits, community groups, and others working on transportation projects focused on prioritizing active transportation safety for all people using streets (inclu ding people walking, biking, and roll ing), beginning with a web portal and research projects that will be publicly available Fall 2022 . o DOT will develop guidance and/or process changes that will help recipients of federal aid prioritize the safety of all people using streets (including people walking , biking , and rolling ) in transportation network planning, design, construction, and operations, including in small towns and rural areas . o DOT will issue guidance clarifying how modes other than motor vehicles should be considered in the planning and design process of roadways . Support physical activity among children both in and out of school. Physical activity contributes to children's overall physical and cognitive health , including improved academic performance ; yet, fewer than one quarter of children ages 6 -17 years old achieve recommended amounts.48 Physical activity and nutrition are parts of comprehensive whole -child approaches to education that build healthy children and supportive learning envi ronments. o ED will provide guidance to states and school districts on how they can use funds under the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act grants and ARP funds to support physical activity for children. WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 30 o ED will, through the Engage Every Student Initiative , promote strategies for increasing participation in physical fitness programs and for incorporating physical activity in summer learning and engagement and after-school programs. o HHS CDC and ED will partner to support districts in implementing a framework for planning and organizing activities for physical education and activities in schools . o HHS ACF will scale efforts to help educators add activities tailored for children to their daily routine that increase quality physical movement and teach children about healthy food choices. B. Support robust and tailored physical activity education and promotion. Along with building environments that support and prompt more p hysical activity, it is important to increase awareness of the benefits of physical activity and offer tips to help people move more. However, many people do not know the recommended amounts of physical activity. To empower Americans to be more active, the Biden -Harris Administration will: Support regular updates to the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and increase awareness of the importance of physical activity. Only 22 % of people are aware of the federal government's Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans .49 These guidelines provide information on the amounts and types of physical activity necessary to become and stay healthy . HHS promote s the guidelines through the Move Your Way\u00ae campaign , but f unding to support the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and the Move Your Way\u00ae campaign has not been consistent . The Biden -Harris Administration will work with Congress and private sector actors to provide funding to support both the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and Move Your Way \u00ae. Tailor physical activity messages to resonate with specific demographic groups. Education is most effective when messages and tactics are tailored to specific audie nces. Yet, most physical activity campaigns fail to target specific demographic groups.50 To create more tailored physical activity messages: o HHS will release evidence -based strategies to increase physical activity among older adults . o HHS IHS will update its Physical Activity Toolkit and re -ignite the Just Move It program designed to help Indigenous people move more. o BOP will enhance its vocational training program to teach inmates to develop individualized exercise and nutrition plans for those who are at -risk for or who currently have diet -related diseases. o BOP will launch a new program , \"Women's Life Skills ,\" which includes nutrition and physical activity sessions designed for women who may have limited experience with independent living or a phy sical or mental disability . This program will be available to all women in BOP facilities. Facilitate physical activity in federal facilities. To serve as a model employer, GSA will reinvigorate the Consider the Stairs campaign in all federal facilities through new signage to encourage employees to take the stairs instead of elevators. GSA will also post WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 31 best practices from the campaign to GSA's website to encourage other employers to adopt this concept. Call to Action for a Whole -of-Society Response State, local, and territory governments should adopt jurisdiction -wide plans and proclamations to promote CDC's Active People, Healthy Nation as we ll as adopt and implement Complete Streets policies and Safe Routes to School programs. State governments should offer free passes for children and/or families to state parks. State, local, and territory governments should increase accessibility for c ommunity members with disabilities to exercise at local parks or workout facilities. State governments should consider establishing and monitoring implementation of more rigorous physical education requirements in schools to meet or exceed the Physical A ctivity Guidelines for Americans' recommendations for children and adolescents. Correctional facilities should provide opportunities for exercise for persons in custody. Employers should encourage physical activity in the workp lace, including by promo ting the use of stairs instead of elevators and active modes of transportation to work , and by providing access to spaces to be physically activ e at work. City bike share companies should subsidize their membership costs for individuals with lower income s. The private sector should invest in building parks and safe sidewalks in underserved neighborhoods. The private sector, non -profits, and local governments should work together to create shared - use agreements to make open spaces, sports facilities, and fields open to schools. Pillar 5 \u2014Enhance Nutrition and Food Security Research: Improve nutrition metrics, data collection, and research to inform nutrition and food security policy, particularly on issues of equity, access, and disparities. The Bide n-Harris Administration is committed to developing innovative, inclusive, impactful , and science -based, policy solutions to address nutrition and food insecurity. The federal government spends approximately $2 billion on nutrition research each year, primarily through HHS National Institute s of Health (NIH). However, there are still gaps in the scientific understanding of nutrition and health . To expand nutrition , health, and food security research efforts and ensure equitable opportunity for marginalized groups to realize the benefit s of research, the Biden -Harris Administration will: WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 32 Bolster nutrition research funding to support evidence -based policies. Adequate funding and staff are needed to effectively conduct consistent and innovative nutrition research. For example, the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) are a set of values used to plan and assess nutrient intakes in the U.S. DRIs are widely used in evaluation research, development of dietar y guidance, population surveillance, program assessment, and consumer education \u2014yet funding to update them regularly is inconsistent and insufficient . Implement a coordinated federal vision for advancing nutrition science. The Administration will increase collaboration across nutrition science and research priorities to identify the research and data needs that are most likely to make a meaningful impact on food security and nu trition. Working with external scientific experts, the Interagency Committee on Human Nutrition Research, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), the President's Council of Advisors on Science & Technology (PCAST) will identify scientific opportunities, gaps, and priorities to continue to advance nutrition science, with a particular emphasis on ensuring equitable access to the benefits of research. Ensure diversity and inclusion in nutrition, health, and food security research . It is critical to ensure equity in research to develop effective policies and interventions that take into account the nutritional needs and cultural preferences and norms of all Americans. o HHS and USDA will select a 2025 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Commit tee (Committee) that has a diverse membership with respect to points of view, expertise, experience, education, and institutional affiliation to reflect the racial, ethnic, gender, and geographic diversity of the U.S. The Committee will review all the Dietary Guidelines for Americans' scientific questions with a health equity lens to ensure that the 2025 -2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans is inclusive of people from diverse racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and cultural backgrounds . The Committee will also explore whether additional example s of healthy dietary patterns should be developed and proposed based on population norms, preferences, and needs of the diverse individuals and cultural foodways with in the U.S. population. HHS and USDA will also start exa mining best practices for adding systems approaches (considering the multiple factors that influence individuals' dietary patterns) to the rigorous evidence review process used for developing the Dietary Guidelines for Americans to ensure they reflect the highest scientific integrity and contain information adaptable for public health and consumer use. o USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) will conduct research to more precisely define nutritional needs of American Indians and Native Alaskans . ARS will also leverage a new partnership between the Grand Forks Human Nutrition Research Center and the University of North Dakota to better understand American Indians and Native Alaskans ' diets and Indigenous foods. Additionally, ARS will expand the National Nutrient database to include reports of the concentrations of nutrients in American Indians and Native Alaskans ' foods. o The HHS NIH Common Fund Community Partnerships to Advance Science for Society (ComPASS) Program will cataly ze, develop, and rigorously assess community -led, health equity structural interventions that leverage multisectoral WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 33 partnerships to advance health equity. ComPASS will also develop a new health equity research model for community -led, multisectoral struct ural intervention research across NIH and other federal agencies. o NPS will update its Healthy Parks, Healthy People Science Plan to add equity and access to parks among underserved populations as a specific research element. o The Appalachian Regional Commi ssion will develop a research report that describes current conditions and innovative approaches to food security and food access in the Appalachian Region. Expand and diversify the nutrition science workforce. A well -trained and diverse nutrition science workforce , including researchers and educators, is critical to promote and strengthen research efforts . o HHS NIH will support advanced training in artificial intelligence for precision nutrition science institut ional training programs . o HHS NIH will invest in research to develop and validate new methodologies in nutrition sciences, including leveraging mobile technologies, applying computational approaches, and using artificial intelligence and machine learning. These efforts require recruitment of trainees from a divers ity of backgrounds, including those from groups historically excluded from biomedical, behavioral , and clinical research ; individuals with disabilities ; and individuals from disadvantaged backgroun ds. o USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture ( NIFA ) will assess its evolving research, education, and extension portfolio to determine which program areas can be utilized to impact workforce development opportunities across the agricultural and nutrition science workforces. For example, NIFA will utilize the Cooperative Extension and their connection to the Land -Gran t University systems ; relationships with state, Tribal, local, county, territory, and university partners ; and community - based presence, as an outreach arm for reaching historically underserved populations , including HBCUs , Tribal Colleges, and Hispanic -Serving Institutions. Invest in creative new approaches to advance research regarding the prevention and treatment of diet -related diseases. Policy interventions must be guided by knowledge of the past but also creative new approaches to accelerate scientific investigation, coordination, and translation of current and future advances . With increasing availabilit y and lower costs of genetic sequencing technologies and artificial intelligence, now is the time to study the impacts that early life nutrition and social and environmental exposures have on healthy development and future diseases. o USDA Agriculture Resea rch Service ( ARS ) will utilize machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches for the development of algorithms to better understand and predict interactions between food - and nutrition -related data and health outcomes. Validated biomarkers of nut rient intake and nutritional status will be identified to address personalized needs for specific foods and components . o HHS NIH will plan research to determine the role of diet and other early -life exposures in health and disease. o HHS NIH will research the interplay between nutrition, oral disease, and comprehensive health . WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 34 o HHS NIH will explore developing validated measurements and methodologies to assess 24-hour patterns of diet, physical activity, and sleep. Bolster data collection to better identify trends . Strategic decisions can be better informed with improved data on communities and/or populations that may most benefit from interventions. HHS CDC and USDA will update national data methods and infrastructure to identify trends in populati on intake of sodium and added sugars. USDA Economic Research Service will develop and implement a second National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey as part of building and maintaining its Consumer Food Data Base. Evaluate federal assistance programs and innovative models to understand impact and areas for improvement and scalability. Continued research, evaluation, and innovation of federal assistance programs can create a strong evidence base to allow for the creation of effective programs. o USDA will work to more effectively measure equity within federal nutrition assistance programs, including across Tribes and among people with disabilities , and build the evidence for these programs ' impact on food insecurity, nutrition, and health. o ED will conduct a survey to better understand how institutions addressed food insecurity among college students during the pandemic ; how schools used Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund grants , including ARP funds, for food pantries ; and how food insecurity persists among college students . ED will also convene institutions to lift up best practices for address ing food insecurity on college campuses . Better understand the SDOH to help achieve health equity. A better understanding of SDOH can provide vital information to inform efforts and improve he alth at the individual and population levels to advance health equity. o HHS CMS will measure social risk factors, including food insecurity, for at -risk Medicare Advantage beneficiaries . o HHS ACL is developing an older adult Nutrition Research Agenda that wi ll involve federal and external partners to identify gaps in existing research regarding food insecurity, hunger, malnutrition , and behavioral health issues in order to develop a long-term framework for advancing the quality of services, establishing research priorities and creating impactful policies. o HUD will map USDA's Food Access Research Atlas with HUD administrative data to pinpoint areas with limited access to affordable and nutritious foods and prioritize education of HUD grantees in those areas to inform their use of HUD programs and grants . o HUD will partner with USDA and the Census Bureau to better understand and address persistent food insecurity among HUD -assisted individuals already connected with nutrition assistance programs . o HUD will include enhancing nutrition and food security research into the next HUD learning agenda for research publications . o DoD will conduct a nalysis of the root causes and impacts of food insecurity and analyze the standardized USDA measure of food security data obtained in the Status WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 35 of Forces Survey of Active Duty and Members, Survey of Active Duty Spouses, Status of Forces Survey of Reserve Component Members, and Survey of Reserve Component Spouses. Research the intersection of climate change , food security, and nutrition. Climate change has direct relevance for the future of food security and human health, altering the nutrient content of cr ops and increasing the risk of undernutrition, infectious diseases, respiratory illness, allergies, cardiovascular diseases, food and waterborne illness, and mental illness. Better understanding how nutrition security is interrelated with challenges and op portunities in the use of natural resources is important to ensure long -term food and nutrition security. o HHS will leverage the NIH Climate and Health Initiative to research the effects of climate change on food quality and nutrition security on the healt h of populations . o USDA NIFA will enter into an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to determine the links between human health and soil health by reviewing existing research on the connections between the human microbiome and soil microbiome and soil management practices and the nutrient density of foods , and identify areas for future research. Call to Action for a Whole -of-Society Response State and territory governments should support nutrition and food sec urity research at universities and colleges, including HBCUs, MSIs, and Tribal Colleges and Universities. State , local, and territory governments should enter into data sharing agreements with universities, think tanks, food retailers, and other entities to provide administrative data about the use of food banks , participation in after -school sports , or development of Tribal traditional food systems. State, local, and territory governments should invest in programs building the pipeline of researchers, particularly from communities of color , rural communities, and people with disabilities. Universities, colleges, and academic medical centers should bolster hunger, nutrition, and physical activity researchand data collection disaggregated by factors , including race, ethnicity, and other demographic and social factors. Philanthropy should support research studies and efforts to bolster and diversify the nutrition science pipeline. The private sector should invest in robust research and development fo cused on nutrition, equity, and health, including research on the microbiome, immunity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases and underserved populations.

DPC also recognizes and is grateful for the late Congresswoman Jackie Walorski for her unwavering commitment to ending hunger. Stakeholders: DPC is thankful for the resounding support, input, an d expertise from a diverse range of stakeholders that cut across all sectors and parts of the country. Our continued collaboration will be key to the successful implementation and long -term sustainability of the strategy . DPC looks forward to working with you in the years ahead to finally end hunger and reduce diet -related diseases and disparities in the U.S. WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 37 Appendix: Development of the Strategy A Whole -of-Government Approach Working across the government, the Biden -Harris Administration developed this holistic, whole - of-government approach to help change the system that allows disparities to persist and to drive transformative change to end hunger and reduce diet -related disea se. The Biden -Harris Administration convened an interagency workgroup to plan and develop this strategy. The interagency workgroup includes 25 agencies and regional commissions. AmeriCorps Appalachian Regional Commission Delta Regional Authority Denali Co mmission Department of Agriculture Department of Commerce Department of Defense Department of Education Department of Health and Human Services Department of Housing and Urban Development Department of Interior Department of Justice Department of Labor Department of Transportation Department of the Treasury Department of Veterans Affairs Environmental Protection Agency Federal Emergency Management Agency Federal Trade Commission General Services Administration Northern Border Regional Commission Office of Personnel Management Small Business Administration Social Security Administration Southeast Crescent Regional Commission Each agency has a role to play in ending hunger and reducing diet -related diseases . An inventory of the numerous existing fede ral programs and initiatives related to food insecurity, nutrition, and diet -related diseases was recently included in a report to Congress. WH I T E HO U S E NA T I O N A L ST R A T E G Y O N HU N G E R , NU T R I T I O N , A N D HE A L T H 38 Stakeholder Engagement In summer 2022, the Biden -Harris Administration conducted robust stakeholder en gagement as part of the process of developing this strategy , including: Hosting six virtual, regional listening sessions that were open to the public; Hosting sector -specific listening sessions for individuals with lived experience , non- profits and advocacy groups , faith-based groups , labor groups; agriculture groups , health care groups; private sector companies , philanthropy , civil rights groups , youth groups , Veteran and military family groups, and many more; Hosting a Tribal Consu ltation; Opening a portal on the White House Conference website for any individual to share their ideas and experiences with hunger and/or diet -related diseases; and Releasing a toolkit that stakeholders could use to host their own convenings with their networks and communities. Anti-hunger, nutrition, and public health advocates; community organizations; state, Tribal, local, and territory governments; food businesses; health care organizations; and many others have pioneered initiatives to end hunger and improve healthy eating and physical activity. Hearing their ideas, stories, and lessons learned was critical to informing this strategy. The Biden -Harris Administration prioritized incorporating insights from people with lived experience, who are often the most impacted by historic inequities, to ensure the actions outlined in the strategy meet the needs of the people they are intended to serve.
