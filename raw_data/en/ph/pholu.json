Sensor nodes are operationalized through limited-power batteries. Therefore, improvement in energy consumption becomes critical in UWSNs. Data forwarding through the nearest sensor node to the sink or base station reduces the network's reliability and stability because it creates a hotspot and drains the energy early. In this paper, we propose the cooperative energy-efficient routing (CEER) protocol to increase the network lifetime and acquire a reliable network. We use the sink mobility scheme to reduce energy consumption by eliminating the hotspot issue. We have divided the area into multiple sections for better deployment and deployed the sink nodes in each area. Sensor nodes generate the data and send it to the sink nodes to reduce energy consumption. We have also used the cooperative technique to achieve reliability in the network. Based on simulation results, the proposed scheme performed better than existing routing protocols in terms of packet delivery ratio (PDR), energy consumption, transmission loss, and end-to-end delay.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-09-14", "cleaned_text": "Cooperative Energy-Efficient Routing Protocol for Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks [https://doi.org/10.3390/s22186945](https://doi.org/10.3390/s22186945) signals are used instead of radio signals in UWSNs to transfer data from the source to the destination because the saltwater firmly interrupts the radio signals. A decentralized UWSN can provide a low-cost solution for rapidly deploying sensors to measure the parameters that may harm the marine environment. Such as defining the quantity and location of an oil or fuel leak, evaluating the surface area and direction of toxic algae banks due to the effect of marine currents, etc. [ [2](#B2-sensors-22-06945)]. [2](#B2-sensors-22-06945)]. Among the most significant unwanted effects in UWSNs is node dying because of inefficient energy use, typically caused by improper route selection. An efficient and energy consumption routing protocol is required concerning the mentioned issues and challenges. The primary factor determining a routing protocol is selecting the relaying node. This node selection mechanism depends on several factors, such as distance, hop count, and residual energy. [3](#B3-sensors-22-06945)]. Furthermore, the network topology also plays an essential role in reducing energy consumption in UWSNs. It means less energy will be used if the network topology is well designed and managed; otherwise, more energy will be wasted, and the nodes will die early. The structure of UWSNs is shown in [Figure 1](#sensors-22-06945-f001). [4](#B4-sensors-22-06945), [5](#B5-sensors-22-06945)]. [6](#B6-sensors-22-06945)]. Cooperation is the optimal strategy for ensuring reliable and effective communication in UAWSNs. 1.1. Motivation [7](#B7-sensors-22-06945)], where the authors focused on reducing energy consumption, increasing network lifetime, and enhancing the packet delivery ratio. Data is transferred on demand to avoid voids and trapped nodes in the data participating process. Due to the abovementioned issues, we proposed the cooperative energy-efficient routing protocol (CEER) to increase the network's lifetime and reliability. 1.2. Contribution - The proposed routing scheme is designed to reduce energy consumption and latency issues. Therefore, the proposed method uses the sink mobility technique to transfer data to the sink node. This will minimize energy consumption because of the direct transmission of data. When the sink is in communication range, the nodes will transfer the data directly to the sink. - Data transferring through a single link does not ensure the reliability of data. Therefore, the proposed method uses the cooperative data forwarding scheme to reduce the end-to-end delay and increase the network's reliability. - The proposed routing scheme performance is evaluated through the MATLAB simulation tool, which shows the improvement in energy consumption, end-to-end delay, PDR, and transmission loss. 1.3. Paper Organization [Section 2](#sec2-sensors-22-06945). The proposed CEER routing protocol with necessary details is discussed in [Section 3](#sec3-sensors-22-06945). [Section 4](#sec4-sensors-22-06945)is the MATLAB simulation of both the proposed and existing two routing protocols are discussed briefly. The last section discusses the conclusion of the paper. 2. Literature Review [8](#B8-sensors-22-06945)]. The authors proposed two routing protocols in the mentioned work. The first is energy-effective and reliable delivery (EERD), and the second is cooperative energy-effective and reliable delivery (CoEERD). The EERD incorporates the sensor node's energy consumption parameter, and the CoEERD addresses the second issue, transferring data through the noisy links. In EERD, data are transferred from source to destination through a single link. The forwarder nodes are selected based on the minor bit error rate (BER), minimum distance to the sink node, and highest residual energy. Data corruption increases while using a single link for data transmission; therefore, the authors introduced an improved version of EERD called CoEERD. The relay node is used among the forwarder nodes for transferring data from the source to the destination. The forwarder node selection process is the same as the EERD, but data are transferred through the relay node when the threshold values are higher than the BER, improving the data transmission on noisy links. Based on the simulation results, the proposed scheme performed better than the existing routing protocols regarding energy consumption and dead and alive nodes. However, high delays due to the node's cooperation persist. [9](#B9-sensors-22-06945)] proposed a reliable multipath energy efficient-routing protocol (RMEER). This research aims to extend the network's lifetime and determine the ideal route for delivering information to the specified destination. The entire network is composed of five distinct and equal layers. The destination node is positioned at the water's surface, and heavy static transmitters are distributed in the other layers. The multipath routing technique is used for data transferring among the sensor nodes. Multilink nodes are used to enhance the packet delivery ratio (PDR). In such a method, if one node dies early in the middle of data transferring, the selection process automatically bypasses the dead node. Based on simulation results, the proposed routing protocol performs better than other routing schemes regarding energy consumption, throughput, and alive nodes. Selecting the new data forwarding node after dying one another increases the latency and decreases the reliability. [10](#B10-sensors-22-06945)]. The multihop technique is used for data gathering and transferring it to the sink node, and the cooperation method is used to improve the network reliability. Data transfers in two phases, the first is data transfer through the forwarder node, and the second is the use of the relay node for data transmission. The maximal ratio combining (MRC) method controls the data transmission when both forwarders receive the information. Additionally, the received signal strength (RSS) method is deployed for finding the distance between the two nodes. The simulation result shows that the proposed protocol performs better in stability and energy consumption. In the proposed scheme, only energy consumption was the focused metric, while the latency and transmission loss were not considered, as the multihop technique consumes more energy. [11](#B11-sensors-22-06945)]. A more advanced version utilizes the fuzzy logic technique (FLT). It generates data and then sends them through a multihop method to the sink, considering the maximum residual power required for data transmission. On top of the node's position, residual energy is a variable in establishing the optimum forwarder. All of the source's neighbors receive the data packet when broadcast. Data are sent to the next node through the optimum node selected among all the nodes in the network. To keep the node alive, its residual energy should be as high as possible, and its position should be as low as possible so that it does not drop to the bottom. Based on simulation results, the proposed routing protocol performs better than the existing routing protocols regarding data transfer speed and the most significant number of active nodes. The authors focused on only energy consumption through the fuzzy logic method, while transmission loss and packet delivery ratio were not discussed. [12](#B12-sensors-22-06945)] propose a power-efficient routing protocol (PER) to reduce energy utilization in the network by choosing the optimum nodes for packet forwarding. Sending node selector and forwarding tree pruning mechanism are two parts of the PER. The first module uses a fuzzy logic interface and tree decision to select the next two forwarder nodes based on angle, residual energy, and distance. In addition, tree forwarding is employed to discover the most efficient route for packet distribution. In reality, tree forwarding stops additional packets from spreading in the network. The different ocean factors, such as noise and transmission loss, are not considered in the design time. [13](#B13-sensors-22-06945)]. Using the proposed routing technique, data are efficiently captured and sent. The sink hierarchically receives information, which is how it should be. This task is broken down into two separate steps to select a procedure. Using the Manhattan method, you can identify which nodes are closest and farthest from your final destination and which media is best for sharing data. Using RSSI, you may estimate how far something is from you. The multimedia modem supports the 70 to 140 kHz bandwidth of acoustic waves. An infrared wavelength range from 700 nm to 1 mm only employs a single bandwidth, and blue light with a wavelength of 450 to 485nm is used to communicate in the visible light spectrum. Simulations show that the suggested method has superior energy consumption, bandwidth, and propagation delay to the current standard. [14](#B14-sensors-22-06945)] is the network's stability and noise analysis. These two factors focus on a routing technique known as a depth-based noise-aware scheme. The whole network is entirely unaware of the existence of any nodes at first. The channel reciprocity rule is observed when a hello packet is sent from the source to the destination. Every node receives its ID number, depth, and noise information from this hello packet. As a result, each node gets to know the others. Every node in the source transmission range receives the information signal when it generates it. There is a massive energy crisis if all network nodes submit this info to the sink node. Only one node is chosen to transmit the packet in this case. This node selects the parameters with the lowest depth and noise. Such a sink node is determined to complete the data transmission successfully. This node should be set to reduce energy usage and improve signal quality. Furthermore, the network's stability period improves as the number of live nodes grows and the number of dead nodes decreases. High network traffic on the relay node issue persists. [15](#B15-sensors-22-06945)] to deal with these problems. This protocol partitioned the network into four sections based on the node depth. The sensor nodes are divided into depth-based zones: the lowest depth node region, the medium depth node region, and the maximum depth node region. Each of these regions has a different depth. A sink node in each area interfaces directly with the ocean sink node. Only one random node from each zone transfers data to the sink node in that region. Each region has its random nodes. It is decided which forwarder node to use based on its low depth value and high residual energy. The network lifetime, throughput, and reliability are all improved due to this configuration. As only one random node is used for data transmission, the chances of data loss will increase. [16](#B16-sensors-22-06945)]. Dispersed energy-efficient and connectivity-aware routing methods are discussed because sink nodes are far from the region of interest. Underwater data transmission is disrupted when commonly utilized overhead lowest depth nodes create a hole in the network. These solutions prevent this problem. Multipath routes are used in this protocol. Low-depth nodes have a lower probability of going dead. Still, a simulation reveals that their lifespan improves from 50% to 70% due to lower-depth nodes bearing less data transmission load. The number of dead nodes decreases while the number of live nodes reaches a maximum. [17](#B17-sensors-22-06945)] proposed a delay-intolerant energy-efficient algorithm known as DIEER. This approach can increase the PDR to avoid collisions in data packet propagation delays. Except for the DIEER protocol, no other routing protocol addresses these issues. As data are retransmitted less frequently, the network uses less energy, which reduces latency. The joint optimization framework for sink mobility, hold, and forwarding mechanisms is introduced. Data aggregation and pattern matching algorithms fix the threshold's adaptive value and reduce network delay while delivering maximum data, increasing the network's life, and using the least energy necessary. An underwater platform with sink mobility and extensive distribution of nodes with different communication radii has been designed for three-dimensional operation. No retransmission of data occurs as a result of adapting the offered protocol. [18](#B18-sensors-22-06945)] designed and developed the Onion, a dependence-based communication protocol for MIMO MRC-WPT. It is the extension of the C1G2 protocol. The authors designed and developed the prototype for the implementation of the evaluation of this protocol. The experiment results show that the proposed protocol performed 40% compared to other dependency schemes in terms of communication ratio. An overview of all the schemes is illustrated in [Table 1](#sensors-22-06945-t001). 3. Proposed Protocol Design Scheme 3.1. Energy Consumption and Network Model [19](#B19-sensors-22-06945)], we assume that every sensor node has information about its location. Underwater systems with fixed bottom-mounted nodes that already have location data can make such an assumption. Anchor nodes cannot always be deployed at the seafloor for Deepwater environments. An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with a self-driving system is used as a reference node in the distributed localization algorithms in this scenario. Three-dimensional (3D) Euclidean space is defined by the function as the distance between two points and as follows: [20](#B20-sensors-22-06945)]. However, in most sensor nodes, sensing ability is reduced when the distance between the sensors and the objects increases. The general model for sensing in underwater wireless sensor networks is shown as: [20](#B20-sensors-22-06945)]. We consider that all the sensor nodes have low battery capabilities and are not recharged or replaced after implementation. The network's lifetime is described as the time it takes for the first sensor node in the network to run out of energy. [21](#B21-sensors-22-06945)] [22](#B22-sensors-22-06945)]. [22](#B22-sensors-22-06945)]. The following statement can be used to express the relationship between the transmitted signal intensity at one meter from the source and the radiated sound intensity in decibels [ [23](#B23-sensors-22-06945)]: [23](#B23-sensors-22-06945)]. 3.2. Routing Strategies [Figure 2](#sensors-22-06945-f002). A different icon shows each sensor node's remaining energy at a particular sensor node. With RF and acoustic modems installed at the water's surface, sink nodes do not need to care about running out of energy. Sinks that do not move about only need to broadcast their locations once during startup, which does not require significant energy. The transmitter sensor nodes are the nodes that hold the data packets. Every data packet carries the location of the sink node, relay node, and source sensor node. Before the data transmission, the is the sender node, and the other nodes are the receiver nodes, as shown in [Figure 2](#sensors-22-06945-f002). The hello packets are transmitted by the node with a minimum radius including the position of itself and the position of the sink node. The cosine of the direction between the and receiver will be calculated by the because it is the closest receiver of the transmitter. The advertisement packet with a radius of will be transmitted by the if the cosine value is greater than 0. The radius will be calculated as: 3.3. Cooperation and Relay Node Selection [Figure 3](#sensors-22-06945-f003), where the Source, the source node, transmits the signals to relay nodes Relay1, Relay2, and the Destination. The signal received by Relay1, Relay2, and Destination is developed as [ [14](#B14-sensors-22-06945)]. |Algorithm 1.

Results and Performance Evaluation of the Proposed and Existing Routing Protocols [Table 2](#sensors-22-06945-t002). Additionally, this section describes the primary performance metrics for all compared protocols. 4.1. Performance Metrics 4.2. Results and Discussion [Figure 4](#sensors-22-06945-f004)illustrates that CEER is better than both the existing routing protocols. The first or initial node in the CEER dies at 1200 s, and is approximately 200 s longer than the EELRP and EEDORVA. In the EELRP and EEDORVA routing schemes, node dying starts gradually after 1000 s. CEER was found to have a more extended period of stability than the existing techniques since it was stable for much time. Compared to the EELRP, the EEDORVA is better after our proposed protocol. The figure illustrates the network's lifetime with the proposed protocol has been enhanced by 15% approximately compared to the EEDORVA and more than 20% from the EELRP. [Figure 5](#sensors-22-06945-f005). The total energy consumption of the CEER is lower than the two other schemes due to efficient data forwarding through the sink nodes. Data are forwarded directly when the sink node is in communication range to minimize energy consumption. When the sink is not in communication range, CEER selects the nearest neighbor node with maximum energy and bit error rate (BER) for data transferring to the sink node. The EELRP routing scheme gathers data in multiple steps because the authors divided the total simulation area into various segments. Each segment has its agent for data gathering and then transfers to the final destination. From the start of the simulation, CEER uses low energy compared to the other two schemes and then decreasing gradually when the time increases. [Figure 6](#sensors-22-06945-f006)shows the packet delivery ratio (PDR) comparison of the CEER and the other two existing routing protocols. The graph illustrates that the CEER performs better in terms of PDR than the other two schemes. The main reason for the high PDR is focusing on lower BER, and the CEER scheme can achieve high PDR by avoiding adverse channel effects. In addition, it uses essential function variables of highest residual energy and lowest distance to select sender and destination. The CEER strategy decreases the number of participating nodes by working with direct communication between the source and destination, which uses minimal energy and keeps the nodes alive for a long time to transmit the packets. The figure illustrates that the proposed routing scheme enhanced the PDR by 20% approximately compared to the EEDORVA and more than 25% compared to the EELRP. [Figure 7](#sensors-22-06945-f007). As shown in the figure, the delay of the proposed scheme is lower than all other schemes because of the lower distance between the sensor and sink node. The high delay in EELRP is to transfer data from multiple stages and not directly sent to the base station. As illustrated in the graph, the EEDORVA performs better than the EELRP because the EEDORVA transfer data to the base station using simple depth value selection. The figure demonstrates that the proposed routing scheme enhanced the end-to-end delay by 200% approximately compared to the EELRP and more than 25% compared to the EEDORVA. [Figure 8](#sensors-22-06945-f008). As illustrated in the graph, using the multiple cooperative nodes is very effective in the CEER compared to the EELRP and EEDORVA noncooperative techniques. 5.
