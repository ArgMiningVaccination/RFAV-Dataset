Yale Cancer Cente r Innovation Awards Announced I am very excited to announce the recipients of our Yale Cancer Center Innovation Awards. Through the generous support of an anonymous donor, Yale Cancer Center has been able to launch 13 ground -breaking scientific projects covering the full gamut of cancer research. The esteemed group of recipients represent the diverse scientific interests of our Center and hails from numerous academic departments across the University and multiple Cancer Center Research Programs. The sel ection process culled out the most exceptional awards for funding from more than 100 strong applications, which were each reviewed and scored by at least two internal reviewers in an NIH -style study section format. I am hopeful that this represents just t he first of many such award cycles, and aim to repeat a similar process annually to continue advancing innovative scientific discoveries at Yale Cancer Center.

Rossi (far right) particip ated in the West Haven Breast Cancer Awareness Program (WHBCAP) check presentation to the Breast Center and Cingari Family Boutique at Smilow Cancer Hospital. I The Developmental Therapeutics Research Program is proud to welcome Lohith Gowda, MD, MRCP . Dr. Gowda is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine (Hematology). As a recent trainee, Dr. Gowda has worked on offering curative intent treatment options for patients with hematologic neoplasms. His initial research as a fellow in Hematology was focused on discovery of a new compound that targets P38 MAPK -Tie2 pathway in myeloid disorders. This compound has now been studied in clinical trials and has shown encouraging results. Subsequently, Dr. Gowda worked on developing a protocol that involves transfusing novel red cell product i n transfusion dependent hematologic malignancies. This work has received FDA approval to begin clinical trials (NCT03056378). Another area of research focus has been to educate patients on appropriate therapeutic decisions that they need to make in an era of increasing drug choices. To facilitate this, Dr. Gowda has developed a predictive model for haplo identical transplant recipients. Currently, he is working on validating his findings with colleagues in Europe. As a new faculty member at Yale, Dr. Gowda looks forward to developing a clinical trial portfolio for patients opting to receive a stem cell transplant. He envisions this initiative will help foster collaborations with our translation teams to offer mechanistic based individualized therapies. Yale Cancer Center welcomes Candice van Emmenes to our team. Candice will serve as the Human Resources General (HRG) for Yale Cancer Center, effective December 1. Candice joined Yale in 2015 and has been a HRG for the Yale School of Public Health, Departm ent of Genetics, and Environmental Health and Safety.

Read M ore >> In honor of #LungCancerAwarenessMonth, listen to an interview with Dr. Roy Herbst, Chief of Medical Oncology and Center. Employee Profile: Donna Durmazlar The North Pavilion's 8th floor in Smilow Cancer Hospital is an outpatient oncology and infusion center, and typically hosts patients who are receiving treatment for solid tumor cancers or are seeing the provider on that floor. As the Manager of Clinical Operations, it is Donna Durmazlar's responsibility to make sure the floor is running efficiently. From helping a provider who is running behind get back on track, to ensuring the front desk staff and medical assist ants are fully staffed each day, to helping out in crisis situations such as a Code Blue, Donna is always there to ask: 'how can I help?' In addition to managing the 8th floor, Donna is also the covering manager for the 7th floor and the Phase 1 Unit fron t desk. To stay on top of all issues, she and other practice and floor managers meet each morning. This morning huddle gives everyone the opportunity to raise and resolve issues, an expert in the treatment of lung cancer, on Yale Cancer Answers.

The players raised funds through raffles and auction prizes during a special game, where the ceremonial first pitch was thrown by a breast cancer survivor whose great grandson was playing in the game! Coincidentally, all of the team members were born at Yale New Haven Chil dren's Hospital 11 years ago when Smilow Cancer Hospital was under construction! Thank you all for your review coverage for call -outs, and review the census for each floor. \"Smilo w is great in that there are strict processes in place to ensure a steady clinic flow and make it as easy as possible for our patients,\" says Donna. \"Patient needs are always our first priority.\" In her seven years with Smilow, Donna has come full circle. She first started as a temp on the 8th floor, working at the front desk checking in patients. Soon, she was hired full time and worked her way up. And now seven years later, she is manager of the same floor. What is most bittersweet is when she still sees the same patients coming in for appointments that she did as a temp at the front desk. \"It is rewarding when you see a patient leaving and they tell you they are in remission. So many patients stop by my office and say 'thank you,' and this is what make s you do everything possible to make their experience better.\" #OOTB Thanks Insil Kim! YCC #OUTOFTHEBLUETHANKS recently recognized Insil Kim, a Clinical Research Coordinator, for her continued commitment to the Head & Neck Cancers DAR T team and the Brain Tumor team, along with their study patients.
