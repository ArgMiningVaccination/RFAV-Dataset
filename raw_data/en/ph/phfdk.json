Mass media, including theinternet, may serve to propagate and establish an urban legend as \"truth\", however careful examination of the legend' sorigin and its contents ultimately reveals it to be false and without basis. The belief that either MMR vaccination or excessive thimerosal exposure may be causally linked to the occurrence ofan autistic spectrum disorder has many of the features of an urban legend. For MMR vaccination it originates in a single small study of 12 children published in the Lancet in 1998, 2 whose essential conclusion was later retracted by ten of its co- authors.3This article serves as the core of the 'vaccination and autism' legend that is now believed to be true by a majority of parents surveyed.4For thimerosal, the legend's origin lies not in ascientific article per se, but in a theoretical proposal published in Medical Hypothesis in 2001.5However, as systematically surveyed by Doja and Roberts6in this issue of the Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences, the vast preponderance of epidemiological data subsequently collected in a variety ofgeographic settings, utilizing a number of investigative approaches, refutes any causal link between autism and eitherprior MMR vaccination or excessive thimerosal exposure. Particularly impressive are the results obtained from large datasets in Denmark, 7the United Kingdom,8-10Finland,11 Sweden,12United States,13Japan14and most recently Canada itself15that each independently have refuted any MMR vaccination and autism causal association. Other systematic reviews, to which that of Doja and Roberts can be appended,have supported these conclusions. 16-18Furthermore, recent rigorous and independent molecular biologic investigations of one corollary hypothesis, that of the persistence of the measlesvirus in autistic children, have yielded negative results and unmasked more methodological flaws in the original work. 19,20 Similarly, epidemiologic studies have refuted, utilizing varying approaches and analyses (cohort and ecological), convincingly any link between excessive thimerosal exposure and later autism.15,21-26Biological studies have also not validated any thimerosal and autism link.27,28 Yet despite the overwhelming scientific epidemiologic evidence and the lack of any plausible scientific hypothesis as towhy the MMR vaccine or thimerosal should cause autism, theCan. J. Neurol. Sci. 2006; 33: 339-340 THE CANADIAN JOURNAL NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES 339Autism and MMR Vaccination or Thimerosal Exposure: An Urban Legend?EDITORIAL belief stubbornly persists. A question is why? Perhaps the answer lies in the nature of an autistic spectrum disorder and our present lack of understanding of its precise biological basis. Originally described by Kanner in the 1940's, autistic spectrum disorders are a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disabilities that share an early age of onset and qualitative, as well as quantitative, impairments in languagedevelopment and reciprocal social interactions. 29Often the disorder is heralded by the loss of previously acquired skills andfrequently the affected children are emotionally unaware or inappropriate, prone to repetitive and at times self-injurious behaviours (stereotypies) and an obsessive desire for samenessor routine. 30Rarely does a detailed medical evaluation reveal a cause for the child's autism which is a source of tremendous frustration for both families and physicians.31Adding to the parent' sfrustration is the frequent lack of any reciprocal love they receive from their child despite their own parental devotionand pre-occupation with the child' sdisability .In addition, many parents have incorporated guilt for their child's condition that can be traced to the early misconception (also stubbornly persistent) that related this perplexing neurobehavioral syndrometo parental child rearing practices. 32 For frustrated often guilt ridden parents, vaccines given co- incidentally at a time that is related to their recall of the onset ofsymptoms in their child, offers a plausible causal attribution. Though a modern technological innovation that collectivelyrepresents the single greatest advance in 20th Century pediatric practice, vaccines have been viewed with suspicion for years byascientifically na\u00efve subset of the general population. 33Indeed, much of the MMR-thimerosal and autism story resembles thatpreviously encountered in the putative link between cellular pertussis vaccine and infantile spasms/childhood encephalopathy. 34This link was also found to be patently untrue. Urban legends are usually harmless and indeed amusing to both storyteller and listener. However, a sad outcome of the autism and vaccination urban legend is the consequence ofdeclining vaccination rate as the scourge of vaccine preventable infectious diseases have faded from the collective memory of the general population. 35The result of this have been well- documented outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases, resulting unfortunately in some deaths.35Beliefs in the \"mercury poisoning\" hypothesis in autism has led to the uncontrolled useof chelation therapies that are not indicated, of unproven efficacy, and potentially dangerous as illustrated by the recent death of a young boy . 36Furthermore, another sad outcome is the diversion of scarce expertise and research dollars to refuting a3104 https://doi.org/10.1017/S0317167100005278 Published online by Cambridge University Presslegend based on fallacy and innuendo. Parents of autistic children deserve answers to the question; \"Why their child?\" Theanswers to such a question lies not in chasing phantoms and legends, but rather pursuing early promising leads offered by recent advances in molecular genetics 37and neuro-imaging.38 Michael Shevell, Eric Fombonne Montreal, Quebec, Canada ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MS is grateful for the support of the Montreal Children's Hospital (MCH) Foundation and Y Country Camp (YCC) during the writing of this manuscript.
