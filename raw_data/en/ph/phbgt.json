The wise elders of these traditions have much to teach us about our role as custodians of the earth and about the central importance of spiritual growth to a life lived well. Learning to take only what we need, to waste little, to honour our ancestors, to listen to our bodies and to the natural world are but some of the teachings these wise elders can share with us. At AYA Healing Retreats, we recognise the sacredness of these teachings and we draw from this generational wisdom passed down through the centuries to offer a powerful, authentic and life-changing healing experience. We are blessed to have our curanderos / curanderas bring their expert knowledge of sacred plant medicines to our retreat center. Their primary role is to guide participants in directing the energy flow of the plant medicines, paving the way for a profound healing experience. Sacred plant medicine healing can be a confronting experience. You will likely feel a variety of distressing emotions and be faced with shadow aspects of your personality and upsetting memories. The confrontation with these uncomfortable thoughts, feelings, and visions can cause us to panic, feel fear, to cry, scream and to vomit. Whilst uncomfortable, for the body to purge past trauma it must first have a chance to detoxify and rid itself of all that is preventing deep and enduring healing to occur. The role of our facilitators, who all have extensive experience in sacred plant medicines and various psychological and creative therapies is to support you to locate the courage you need to move through the difficulty. Their primary role is to ensure your wellbeing. Our facilitators will create a loving, compassionate space in which all participants feel safe, respected and free to express themselves authentically. Vocal Awakening Guide, Soulsong Revival Facilitator, Trauma Expert, Integration Support Our new home and the location for the majority of our Ayahuasca Retreats.

We understand not everyone is able to make it out to peru, and want to offer a more convienent solution to make powerful healing experiences more accessible. Sacred plant medicine is a tool for realising profound spiritual, emotional and physical healing. These traditional medicines are gifts; gifts that over centuries have been cultivated and used by the indigenous tribespeople of the Amazon Basin to transform lives. As the direct recipients of this healing it is our social and personal responsibility to ensure that we use our new-found knowledge, wellness and transformation for good. AYA Healing Retreats is committed to creating a more compassionate, safe and equal world. Which is why we support one extraordinary humanitarian project. We are 100% transparent with our community. We will regularly update all participants of our retreats on how their contributions are being used to effect genuine changes in the lives those our partner NGO's support. We will also visit, monitor and report back on the impact our donations are making. We only send useful content or promotions The Shipibo people have a population of between 35,000 and 40,000 people and are one of the largest and most resilient tribes in the Peruvian Amazon. Today, the Shipibo live in approximately 150 small communities nestled along the Ucayali River. Around 1600, Spanish missionaries first began to flood the Amazon rainforest, looking to convert the Shipibo to Christianity and to colonise the region. The Shipibo resisted and it wasn't until 1950's that Christian missionaries attempted once more, with varying degrees of success to convert the Shipibo people. The Shipibo people are a resilient tribe, and despite numerous attacks on their culture and traditions, they have retained their traditional knowledge and customs. The Shipibo people are deeply respected for their knowledge of the sacred plant medicines, ceremony and their spiritual connection to the rainforest environment. Traditionally, the Shipibo women, or Shipiba's are artisans and are responsible for creating intricate and beautiful pottery, textiles and jewellery. The ceremonial songs, or Icaros and the energy that the songs produce is used to inspire the visual aesthetics of the Shipibo's textiles, resulting in designs that are truly unique and hypnotic. Several terrible political policies in the past have led to widespread degradation of the Shipibo's natural environment. Increasing pollution of the waterways, unsustainable palm oil plantations, oil spills and the predominance of multinational oil and timber companies is an unrelenting threat to the Shipibo people. With this is mind, AYA Healing Retreats is committed to not contributing to the devastation of the Shipibo people that has been legislated by the Peruvian government for decades. We are committed to supporting the Shipibo people's right to self-determination and to contributing what we can to restoring the vitality of the Amazon Rainforest. Don Miguel was born into a Shipibo community called Roaboya on the River Ucayali. When Don Miguel was a child, Angel Sanchez Vargas, his grandfather was the community's curandero. Vargas was an expert in sacred plant medicines and was frequently called upon to heal and share his spiritual wisdom with members of Roaboya. The school built some years later was named after Vargas and Roaboya went on to be recognised as the first indigenous community 114 years ago. Don Miguel grew up surrounded by the Shipibo wisdom and possess intimate knowledge of the sacred plant medicines. At a very young age he began his apprenticeship as a curandero through plant dietas under the supportive guidance of his grandfather. Miguel is also a trained literature professor and thoroughly enjoys teaching the Shipibo language and culture. Since 2012, Don Miguel has spent the bulk of his time leading lectures, workshops, initiation courses and retreats. Don Miguel will lead our Ayahuasca ceremonies, circle discussions and be available for personal consultations whilst on retreat. Maestra Juana was born into the Shipibo community of Pahoyan, one of the most powerful Shipibo healing lineages in the Peruvian Amazon. She is around 60 years old, however her exact age is unknown.She has been studying for more than 35 years under Maestra Manuela, Papa Gilberto and Papa Bejamin, who are all members of the highly-respected curandero family, the Mahua family. Juana began her dieta on the mythical Amazonian tree Noya Rao when she was just 20 years old and has dedicated her life to the path of healing ever since. Juana is also very learned in the workings of the human body, possessing an excellent knowledge of the bones and skeletal system. Juana specialises in bone massage and will be available on the Noya Rao retreat to provide our guests with this unique healing experience. We are delighted to have Juana's expertise, depth of wisdom and fun loving spirit with us on the Noya Rao retreat. Papa Gilberto Mahua was born into a lineage of renowned Shipibo healers. His grandfather, father and earliest ancestors were all respected curanderos, who, Like Gilberto, were initiated into the plant medicine tradition at a very young age. Gilberto completed his first master plant dieta at the age of 11. For eighteen months, Gilberto saw only his father and uncle who were guiding him through the dieta and his two brothers who are also being apprenticed in Amazonian plant medicine. Ayahuasca and Tobacco along with Ayahuma, Bobinsana, Huaira Caspi and Chiric Sanango formed the basis of his initial journey with master plants. Since that time, Gilberto has accumulated close to 60 year's experience working in concert with master plants to promote healing in himself and others. He is regarded in his local community along the Ucayali River and throughout the West as a healer of great integrity, wisdom and excellence. Gilberto is revered not only for his experience and expertise but for his commitment to keeping the Shipibo healing traditions alive at a time when their culture faces ever-increasing political and environmental threats. Gilberto is regarded as a father to his students. He cares deeply about the healing journey of each and every person and brings great compassion and strength to our ceremonies. His kindness and compelling presence coupled with his singular expertise create a container of safety that enables students to truly surrender to the healing process.

Born in the United States, Adelina began her healing path at the young age of 5 with deep initiations through the womb. Modern-day medicine saved her life and would later unfold her dharma. Rooted in her Native American and Italian heritage, she began communing with the dreamworld and spirits in her early teens. She has always felt deeply guided by her ancestors. In 2011, Adelina graduated from university with a Bachelor's in Human Behavior and Health Education, intending to attend medical school.

She received many instructions from this plant teacher and shared deep prayers of gratitude. Following the call, Adelina traveled to the sacred lands of Mount Shasta to complete her facilitation certification in Clarity Breathwork. The sacred medicine continued to speak with her in dreams until she met with her again and full trust of this path was born. She has spent the past 3 years assisting in circles and helping in ceremonies. After holding space for so many, she began to realize the importance of grounded integration while working with such intelligent plant allies. This led to an in-depth focus on somatic studies, attachment theory, non-violent communication, and mind-body practices. Coming from a bloodline of addiction and sexual trauma, a lot came to surface while studying. She returned to the amazon to sit with Maestra Juanita and the Master Plant Noya Rao at AYA Healing Retreat Center in 2019 - where her respect for this path deepened even more. Adelina is now focused on supporting people as they move through their traumas, addictions, ancestral conditions, and unaligned habits.

Alianza Arkana work primarily with rural and urban Shipibo people who, due to mass deforestation, marginalisation and discrimination face increasing hardship and the devastation of their homelands. Each project that Alianza Arkana embarks on is guided and led by the needs of the local Shipibo community. This has a twofold benefit. Firstly the Shipibo people are involved in making decisions about what's best for their collective community, and secondly, they are active leaders in realising the changes they wish to see, which enables them to benefit financially from the projects. Some of the key projects that Alianza Arkana has committed to include improvements in sanitation and the quality of community drinking water, scholarships that support Shipibo youth to go to university and advocating for indigenous rights and environmental justice by strengthening indigenous federations and collectives.

Plant medicines are tools, like any other healing modality and like other tools for healing experiencing them entails certain risks. We need to make sure that our plant medicines will not compromise your wellbeing or harm you in any way before we allow you to begin your healing journey with us. In short, we care about your safety and we need to do what we can to ensure that during your time with us you are not at risk of harm. Plant medicines can be dangerous if the plants are not the right fit for the individual. Your answers to this questionnaire will help us to determine whether the plants we intend to use are going to help, rather than harm you "}
