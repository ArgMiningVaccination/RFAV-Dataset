The comission aimed to identify research on the effectiveness of primary prevention strategies for preventing work-related stress and occupational injuries among workers. Methods We conducted a search strategy for a sy stematic literature search. Searches were carried out in September 2015. Tw o researchers independently screened all identified references to assess inclusion according to predefined criteria. Results In total, we identified 118 relevant refe rences - 3 potential ov erviews of overviews - 22 potential systematic reviews - 93 randomized controlled trials 84 of the studies were pu blished between 2010-2015 8 randomized controlled trials were from a Nordic country The majority of the studies targeted health personnell, such as nurses and doctors There were also many studies that targ eted teachers, blue collar indu stry employe es, and governmental employee s The two most frequently described interventions were psychoeducat ional approaches and mindfulness There is a substantial amou nt of systematic research and primary research about the effectivess of primary prevention strategies for preventing work- related stress and occupational injuries among workers. Much of this research targets health personnell and concerns psychoeducational strategies and mindfullness. In this systematic literature search we have not read the articles in full and hence neither critically evaluated the studies nor synthesized the results. Thus, we can not draw any conclusions regarding the studies' results. A full systematic review or summaries of existing systematic reviews would provide a good evidence-base for assessing the effectiveness of primary prevention strategies for preventing work-related stress and occupational injuries among workers.

Effectiveness of organizational interventions for the prevention of stress in the workplace. Health Technology Assessment Database. 2009(3). Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of organizational-level interventions for the prevention of oc- cupational stress in terms of reducing stress, ps ychological symptoms, absenteeism, presenteeism, and turnover. Results: According to the reviewed evidence, research methods in the area of occupational stress prevention have improved over the past 10 ye ars. However, the need for more rigor remains. Six systematic reviews (SRs) assessed the effectiveness of organizational stress prevention interventions and met the inclusion criteria of this review. Three SRs focused on healthcare workers as their popula- tion of interest, whereas the remaining three included employees regardless of the industry or occupa- tion in which they worked. In these studies there was considerable variability in how interventions were classified, the types of strategies employed, and the instruments used to measure outcomes. The follow- ing points follow from the reviewed evidence: Stress: Two interventions of good methodological quality were associated with significant re ductions in employee stress. One consisted of a psychological train- ing program with theory, role play ing, and experiential exchanges, whereas the other intervention con- sisted of \"action teams,\" whereby employee representatives liaised with management and employees to improve team communication and co hesiveness, work scheduling, conf lict resolution, and the recogni- tion of good work. Burnout: Five in terventions were associated with si gnificant reductions in employee burnout, although only tw o received good methodolog ical quality ratings. One consisted of an emotion- oriented care training program, in cluding clinical lessons and superv ision meetings, whereas the other, a participatory intervention, was based on \"health ci rcles,\" in which small gr oups of employee repre- sentatives met to identify psychosocial stressors and recommend solutions. Psychological wellbeing: Seven interventions were associated with significant improvements in psychological wellbeing. Four received good methodological qual ity ratings. Two interventions used a participatory approach to re- 26 duce stress, including the creation of committees with employee representatives. The other two in- volved policy or procedural changes: (a) the immediat e transfer of control over production to employee work groups and (b) the introduction of flexible working hours. Sickness absence and absenteeism: Seven interventions were associated with reductions in absenteeism, three of which statistical signifi- cance was reported. These three interventions also received generally high methodological quality rat- ings. In addition to improving p sychological wellbeing, the two part icipatory interventions mentioned above significantly reduced absenteeism. An interven tion consisting of more teamwork, more person- nel, role clarification, production goals, fewer supe rvisors, a partial change in the shift system, and in- creased feedback significantly reduce d sick leave. Turnover: Four interventions were associated with a reduction in employee turnover, on e of which statistical significance was reported. A change to a pri- mary care nursing model with support from managers, advice on core skills, and promotion of effective interprofessional communication redu ced turnover. Conclusions: There is limited evidence that organi- zational-level interventions reduce stress, psycholo gical symptoms, or absenteeism in the workplace when compared to no-intervention controls or othe r interventions. We have drawn no conclusions on the effectiveness of one intervention relative to anot her. Studies have not yet incorporated measures of presenteeism in their evaluation of stress prevention interventions. Bhui KS, Dinos S, Stansfeld SA, White PD. A synthesis of the evidence for managing stress at work: a review of the reviews reporting on anxiety, depression, and absenteeism. Journal of environmental and public health. 2012;2012:515874. Background: Psychosocial stressors in the workplace are a cause of anxi ety and depressive illnesses, su- icide and family disruption. Methods: The present review synthesizes the evidence from existing sys- tematic reviews published between 1990 and July 2011. We assessed the effectiveness of individual, or- ganisational and mixed intervention s on two outcomes: mental health and absenteeism. Results: In to- tal, 23 systematic reviews included 499 primary stud ies; there were 11 meta-a nalyses and 12 narrative reviews. Meta-analytic studies found a greater effect size of individual interventions on individual out- comes. Organisational interventions showed mixed ev idence of benefit. Organi sational programmes for physical activity showed a reductio n in absenteeism. The findings from the meta-analytic reviews were consistent with the findings from the narrative reviews. Specifically, cognitive-behavioural programmes produced larger effects at the individual level comp ared with other interventi ons. Some interventions 27 appeared to lead to deterioration in mental health and absenteeism outcomes.Gaps in the literature in- clude studies of organisational outc omes like absenteeism, the influence of specific occupations and size of organisations, and studies of the comparative e ffectiveness of primary, secondary and tertiary pre- vention. Conclusions: Individual interventions (like CBT) improve in dividuals' mental health. Physical activity as an organisational intervention reduces ab senteeism. Research needs to target gaps in the evi- dence. Jacobs S, Hassell K, Johnson S. The effectiveness of organisational stress management and prevention strategies: What can community pharmacy learn from existing evidence? International Journal of Pharmacy Practice. 2013;21:78-9. Introduction: Workplace stress is a current concer n amongst community pharmacists. The response of community pharmacies to perceived increases in wo rkplace pressures could be instrumental in ensur- ing that they do not adversely affect pharmacists' wellbeing or lead to an increase in dispensing errors. Yet no evidence exists of cost-effective solutions to workplace stress in community pharmacy settings. As part of a scoping study, a review of the wider or ganisational literature was conducted to identify ef- fective organisational inte rventions for preventing or managing workplace stress. Methods This review did not require ethical approval. A secondary synthe sis of existing reviews (1995-2010) from peer-re- viewed and professional sources was conducted. Re views were identified through existing knowledge and keyword searching of the internet and electron ic databases (OVID: Medline, Cinahl, HMIC; CSA: social science databases, ABI Inform). Search terms included those relating to work stress, intervention studies, and review papers. Inclusion/exclusion criteria limited the scope of the review and guided the identification and selection of papers. Crucially, on ly reviews of intervention s including an organisa- tional element (i.e. targeted at the organisational level, or at the interface between the individual and organisation2) were included; revi ews of interventions focused sole ly on the individual2 were not within the scope of this study (although some included elements of individual-level interventions which are reported ). A pro-forma was used to extract data including details of interventions, their effective- ness, and opportunities and barriers to implementation. Extracted data were analysed using a combina- tion of tallies of frequency and a narrative synthesis approach. Results Evidence of the effectiveness of a range of organisational in terventions for the prevention and management of workplace stress was iden- tified. Individual-level interventions with the greatest volume of supporting evidence included stress 28 management training, cognitive behavioural approach es and counselling. Interventions focused on the interface between the individual and organisation with the greatest volume of supporting evidence in- cluded those increasing employee participation, improving communicati on and involving skill training. At the organisational level, the greatest volume of evidence was found for the effectiveness of interven- tions modifying task or job characteristics, target ing aspects of the physical working environment and those involving changes to work sche duling (e.g. flexi-time , rest breaks, shift patterns). The most com- monly identified benefits to employees were a reduct ion in perceived stress, increased job satisfaction and improved psychological well-being. The benefits to organisations most commonly demonstrated were reduced sickness absence, improved organisati onal culture/climate and increased performance/ productivity. Finally, a model of be st practice in organisational stress management and prevention was derived from data on opportunities and barriers to implementation. Discussion This review has synthe- sised existing evidence for the effectiveness of organisational interventions for preventing or managing workplace stress. Whilst none of the interventions described were conducted in a community pharmacy setting, the list of interventions generated provides a good starting point for those seeking to develop evidence-based strategies in stress management and prevention in this sector. Moreover, the derived model of best practice may be tr ansferrable to a community pharmacy setting. The findings from the literature review were used as the basis for discu ssion in stakeholder interv iews in the wider scoping study to explore what was already happening in co mmunity pharmacy organisations to prevent or man- age workplace stress, and what else might be suitab le, acceptable and/or adaptable in the community pharmacy context.

Health promotion interventions may be a possi bility to improve work situations and behavior. Methods: A systematic lite rature search is conducted in 32 databases limited to English and Ger- man publications since 1990. Moreover, internet-searches are performed and the reference lists of identified articles are scanned. The selection of literature was do ne by two reviewers independ ently according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data extraction and tables of evidence are verified by a second expert just like the assess- ment of risk of bias by means of th e Cochrane Collaboration's tool. Results: We identified eleven intervention studies and two systematic reviews. There were three ra ndomized controlled trials (RCT) and one controlled trial without randomization (CCT) on the improvement of physical health, four RCT and two CCT on the im- provement of psychological health an d one RCT on both. Study duration ra nged from four weeks to two years and the number of participants included from 20 to 34 5, with a median of 56. Interventions and populations were predominantly heterogeneous. In three studies intervention for the improvement of physical health re- sulted in less complaints and increase d strength and flexibility with statis tically significant differences between groups. Regarding psychological health interventions lead to significantly decreased intake of analgesics, better stress management, coping with workload, communicatio n skills and advanced training. Discussion: Taking into consideration the small to very sm all sample sizes, other methodological flaws like a high potential of bias and poor quality of reporting the validi ty of the results has to be considered as limited. Due to the heterogeneity of health interventions, st udy populations with differing job specializat ions and different lengths of study dura- tions and follow-up periods, the comparison of results wo uld not make sense. Conclusions: Further research is necessary with larger sample sizes, wi th a sufficient study duration and follo w-up, with a lower risk of bias, by considering of relevant qual ity criteria and with better reporting in publications. Edwards D, Burnard P. A systematic review of stress and stress management interventions for mental health nurses. Journal of Health care professionals in the Unit ed Kingdom (UK) appear to have high er absence and sickness rates than staff in other sectors, and stress may be a reason for nu rses leaving their jobs. These problems need to be ad- dressed, particularly in the mental health field, if curr ent service provision is to be maintained. The aim was to identify stressors, moderators and stre ss outcomes (i.e. measures included those related to stress, burnout and job satisfaction) for mental health nu rses, as these have clear implications for stress manage ment strategies. A 30 advanced nursing. 2003;42(2):169-200. systematic review of research publis hed in English between 1966 and 2000 and undertaken in the UK that spe- cifically identified participants as mental health nurses was carried out to determine the effectiveness of stress management interventions for those wo rking in mental health nursing. Studies from non-UK countries were examined as potential models of good practice. The stud y was limited to primary research papers that specifi- cally involved mental health nurses, where the health outcomes measured were stressors, moderators and stress outcomes and where sufficient data was provided. The initial search identified 176 papers, of these 70 met the inclusion criteria. Seven studies have been reported since the completion of the review and have been included in this article. Sixty-nine focused on the stressors, mo derators and stress outcomes and eight papers identified stress management techniques. Relaxation techniques, training in behavioural techniques, stress management workshops and training in therapeuti c skills were effective stress manage ment techniques for mental health nurses. Methodological flaws however, were detracted from the rigor of many of the studies. The review demon- strated that a great deal is known about the sources of st ress at work, about how to measure it and about the im- pact on a range of outcome indicators. What was found to be lacking was a translation of these results into prac- tice, into research that assessed the impact of interv entions that attempt to moderate, minimize or eliminate some of these stressors. Facey AD, Tallentire V, Selzer RM, Rotstein L. Understanding and reducing work-related psychological distress in interns: a systematic review. Internal medicine journal, 2015;45(10):995-1004 Objective: To collate and evaluate st udies investigating either the factors influencing work-related psychological distress in postgraduate year one (PGY1) doctors, or stra tegies designed to reduce it. Study design: A systematic review conducted in May 2014. Data sources: Key da tabases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Embase) and manual searches of reference lists for relevant studies published in the last 15 years. Study se lection: Empirical research designed to either elucidate the factors influencing work-r elated psychological distress in PGY1 doctors, or ex- amine the effects of an intervention designed to reduce it. Data extraction: Key in formation was extracted into an electronic data extraction form which incorporated el ements of Murphy's model of work stress factors. Data synthesis: Twenty-one studies were included in the re view; 16 studies had examined the factors influencing work-related psychological distress, four studies had invest igated strategies to reduce it and a single study ad- dressed both. Analysis of the findings of each individual study through the conceptual framework provided by Murphy's model revealed a discrepancy between the fact ors influencing work-related psychological distress and 31 the focus of strategies designed to reduce it. Factors such as career progression and a PGY1 doctor's role within the organization were not addressed in the interventions identified. Conclusions: Significant sources of psycho- logical distress in PGY1 doctors remain overlooked by cu rrent interventions. Strategies designed to prevent or reduce psychological distress should be broad-based and grounded in both the literature exploring salient fac- tors and existing theories of work-related stress.

Strategies to promote coping and resilience in oncology and palliative care nurses caring for adult patients with malignancy: A comprehensive systematic review. JBI Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports. 2015;13(5):131-204. Background: Cancer care nurs ing is perceived as personal ly and professionally demanding. Developing effective coping skills and resilience has been associated with better health and we llbeing for nurses, work longevity and improved quality of patient care. Objectives: The objective of this systematic review was to identify personal and organizational strategies that promote coping and resilience in oncology and palliative care nurses caring for adult patients with malignancy. Methods: The search strategy identified publis hed and unpublished studies from 2007 to 2013. Individual search strategies were de veloped for the 12 databases accessed and search alerts established. The review considered qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods studies that assessed personal or organizational interventions, prog rams or strategies that promoted coping and resilience. These included studies employing clinical supervision, staff retreats, psycho-educational programs, compassion fatigue resili- ence programs, stress inoculation therapy and individual approaches that reduced th e emotional impact of can- cer care work. The outcomes of interest were the experience of factors that influence an individual's coping and resilience and outcomes of validated measures of coping or resilience. Methodological quality of studies was in- dependently assessed by two reviewers prior to inclusion in the review using standardized critical appraisal in- struments developed by the Joanna Bri ggs Institute. Standardized Joanna Br iggs Institute tools were also used to extract data. Agreement on the synthesis of the findin gs from qualitative studies was reached through discus- sion. The results of quantitative studie s could not be statistically pooled gi ven the different study designs, inter- ventions and outcome measures. These studies were presen ted in narrative form. Results: Twenty studies were included in the review. Ten studies examined the experience of nurse's caring for the dying, the emotional im- pact of palliative care and oncology work and strategies to prevent burnout or avoi d compassion fatigue, chal- lenges in self-care, and processes nurses adopted to co pe with work related stress . Six studies evaluated differ- ent interventions provided by organizations to improve coping and resilience. Evidence for the effectiveness of 32 interventions was limited to three studies. The result s are discussed under four headings: (i) preventative measures (ii) control measures (iii) unburdening and \"letting go\", and (iv ) growing and thriving. Conclusion: This review identified a number of strategies to better prepare nurses for practice and maintain their psycholog- ical wellbeing. Although no firm conclusions can be draw n in respect to the most effe ctive interventions, strate- gies with merit included those that: a) foster connections within the team; b) provide education and training to develop behaviors that assist in controlli ng or limiting the intensity of stress, or aiding recovery; and c) assist in processing emotion and learning from experiences. Althou gh individuals must take re sponsibility for developing personal strategies to assist coping and resilience, organi zational support is integral to equipping individuals to deal with work related challenges. McCray LW, Cronholm PF, Bogner HR, Gallo JJ, Neill burnout: is there hope? Family medicine. 2008;40(9):626-32. Background: Prevalent among resident physicians, burnout has been associated with absenteeism, low job satis- faction, and medical errors. Little is known about the nu mber and quality of interventions used to combat burn- out. Methods: We performed a system atic review of the literature using MEDLINE and PubMed databases. We included English-language ar ticles published between 1966 and 2007 id entified using combin ations of the fol- lowing medical subject heading terms: interven tion studies, program evaluation, internship and resi- dency, graduate medical education, medical student, he alth personnel, physician, re sident physician, resident work hours, and work hour limitations. Additional articles were also identi fied from the reference lists of manu- scripts. The quality of research was graded with the St rength of Evidence Taxonomy (SORT) from highest (level A) to lowest (level C). Results: Out of 190 identified articles, 129 were reviewed. Nine studies met inclusion cri- teria, only two of which were random ized, controlled trials. In terventions included workshops, a resident assis- tance program, a self-care interventi on, support groups, didactic sessions, or stress-management/coping train- ing either alone or in various combinations. None of the studied interventions achieved an A-level SORT rating. Conclusions: Despite the potentially se rious personal and professional cons equences of burnout, few interven- tions exist to combat this problem. Prospective, controlled studies are needed to examine the effect of interven- tions to manage burnout among resident physicians. 33 Ruotsalainen JH, Verbeek JH, Marine A, Serra C. Preventing occupational stress in healthcare workers. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. 2014;12:CD002892. Background: Healthcare workers can suffer from occupational stress as a result of lack of skills, organisational factors, and low social support at work which may lead to distress, burnout and psychosomatic problems, and deterioration in quality of life and se rvice provision. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of work- and per- son-directed interventions compared to no intervention or alternative interventions in preventing stress at work in healthcare workers. Search method s: We searched the Cochrane Central Register 2013. SE- LECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions aimed at preventing psychological stress in healthcare workers. For organisational interv entions, interrupted time-ser ies and controlled before- and-after (CBA) studies were also eligible. Data collect ion and analysis: Two review authors independently ex- tracted data and assessed trial quality. We used Standa rdised Mean Differences (SMDs) where authors of trials used different scales to measure stress or burnout. We co mbined studies that were similar in meta-analyses. We used the GRADE system to rate the qual ity of the evidence. Main results: In this update, we added 39 studies, making a total of 58 studies (54 RCTs and four CBA st udies), as cognitive-behavioural training (CBT) (n = 14), mental and physical relaxation (n = 21), combined CBT and relaxation (n = 6) and organisati onal interventions (n = 20 ). Follow-up was less than one month in 24 stud- ies, one to six in 22 studies and more than six months in 12 studies. We categorised outcomes as stress, anxiety or general health. There was low-quality evidence that CBT with or without relaxation was no more effective in reducing stress symptoms than no intervention at one month follow-up in six stud ies participants). But at one to six months follow-up in seven studies (SMD - -0.16; 549 partic ipants, 13% relative risk reduction), and at more than six months follow- up in two studies (SMD -1.04, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.70; 157 participants) CBT with or without relaxation reduced stress more than no intervention. CBT interventions did not lead to a considerably greater effect than an alter- native intervention, in three studies. Physical relaxation (e.g. massage) was more effective in reducing stress than no intervention at one month follow-up in four st udies (SMD -0.48, 95% CI -0.89 to -0.08; 97 partici- pants) and at one to six months follow-up in six studies (SMD -0.47; 95% CI -0.70 to -0.24; 316 participants). Two studies did not find a considerable difference in stress between massage and taking extra breaks.Mental relaxation (e.g. meditation) led to similar stress symptom levels as no intervention at one to six months follow- up in six studies (SMD -0.50, 95% CI -1.15 to 0.15; 205 pa rticipants) but to less stress in one study at more than 34 six months follow-up. One study showed that mental relaxation reduced stress more effectively than attending a course on theory analysis and another that it was more effe ctive than just relaxing in a chair. Organisational in- terventions consisted of changes in working conditions, organising support , changing care, increasing commu- nication skills and changing work schedules. Changin g work schedules (from continuous to having weekend breaks and from a four-week to a two-week schedule) re duced stress with SMD -0.55 (95% CI -0.84 to -0.25; 2 trials, 180 participants). Other organisational intervention s were not more effective than no intervention or an alternative intervention. We graded the quality of the ev idence for all but one comparison as low. For CBT this was due to the possibility of publicat ion bias, and for the other comparisons to a lack of precision and risk of bias. Only for relaxation versus no intervention was th e evidence of moderate qual ity. Authors' conclusions: There is low-quality evidence that CBT and mental and ph ysical relaxation reduce stre ss more than no interven- tion but not more than alternative interventions. There is also low-quality evidence that changing work sched- ules may lead to a reduction of stress . Other organisational interventions ha ve no effect on stress levels. More randomised controlled trials are needed with at least 120 participants that compare the intervention to a pla- cebo-like intervention. Organisational interventions need better focus on reduction of specific stressors. Stewart W, Terry L. Reducing burnout in nurses and care workers in secure settings. Nurs Stand. 2014;28(34):37-45. Aim: To identify which educational interventions reduce burn out and promote wellbein g in nurses and care workers in secure settings. Method: A systematic review of health, educational and criminal justice literature was undertaken to appraise relevant studies and identify educational interventions that were effective in reduc- ing burnout. Findings: There is some evidence that clin ical supervision and psycholo gical intervention training are successful in reducing burnout in nurses and care workers in secure settings. Conclusion: Supportive rela- tionships can help nurses to manage emotional stress, and continuing pe rsonal and professi onal development can reduce burnout in qualifie d nurses in secure settings. Van Mol M, Kompanje EJ, Benoit D, Bakker J, Nijkamp M. The Prevalence of Compassion Fatigue and Background: Working in the stressful environment of the Intensive Care Un it (ICU) is an emotionally charged challenge that might affect the emotional stability of medi cal staff. The quality of care for ICU patients and their relatives might be threatened through long-term absenteeism or a brain and skill drain if the healthcare profes- sionals leave their jobs prematurely in order to preserve their own health. Purpose: The purpose of this review is 35 Burnout among Healthcare Professionals in Intensive Care Units: A Systematic Review. PLoS One. 2015;10(8):e0136955. to evaluate the literature related to emotional distress among healthcare professionals in the ICU, with an em- phasis on the prevalence of burnout and compassion fatigue and the available preventive strategies. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted, using Em base, Medline OvidSP, Cinahl, Web-of-science, Psych- INFO, PubMed publisher, Cochrane an d Google Scholar for articles publ ished between 1992 and June, 2014. Studies reporting the prevalence of burnout, compassion fatigue, second ary traumatic stress and vicarious trauma in ICU healthcare professionals were included, as well as related intervention studies. Results: Forty of the 1623 identified publications, whic h included 14,770 respondents, met th e selection criteria. Two studies re- ported the prevalence of compassion fatigue as 7.3% an d 40%; five studies described the prevalence of second- ary traumatic stress ranging from 0% to 38.5%. The reported prevalence of burnout in the ICU varied from 0% to 70.1%. A wide range of intervention strategies emerged from the recent literature search, such as different intensivist work schedu les, educational programs on coping with emotional distress, improving communication skills, and relaxation methods. Conclu sions: The true prevalence of burn out, compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress and vicarious trauma in ICU healthcare professionals remains open for discussion. A thorough exploration of emotional distress in relation to communication skills, et hical rounds, and mindfulness might provide an appropriate starting point for the development of further preventive strategies.

Re- sults: Seven studies were included in the review. Just one reported an evaluation of a stress management in- tervention. Reported sources of stress for clinical psycho logists included client characteristics, excessive work- loads, professional self-doubt and p oor management. Coping strategies included talking with colleagues, and other \"active\" approaches to personal stress management. Up to 40% of UK clinical psychologists participating in studies were found to be experiencing \"caseness\" le vels of distress. Conclusion s: Mental health work is stress-provoking. However, organizati onal and professional factors may mi litate against psychologists seeking and receiving support at work. Patterson GT, Chung IW, Swan PW. Stress management interventions for police officers and recruits: A meta- analysis. Journal of Experimental Criminology. 2014;10(4):487-513. Objective: A systematic review was co nducted to examine the effects of stress management interventions on outcomes among police officers and recruits. Methods: The search metho ds included searchin g electronic da- tabases, journals, books, conference proceedings, webs ites and contacting organizations and authors. Inclu- sion criteria were randomized contro lled trials and quasi-experimental stud ies, and any type of stress manage- ment intervention given to police offi cers, recruits or civilian law enforc ement personnel. Results: The 12 pri- mary studies included in the systemat ic review were published between 1984 and 2008 and included 8 pub- lished studies, 3 unpublished doctoral dissertations, and 1 unpublished report. The sample was comprised of 906 participants, with an average age of 34.48 years, an d an average of 10.77 years of police experience. The average duration of the interventions was 10.95 h with a range of 30 min to 24 h. A total of 221 effects were examined in a meta-analysis. Effect sizes were calcul ated separately for physiolog ical, psychological and be- havioral outcomes. The overall mean effect for physiol ogical outcomes was 0.196, 0.038 among psychological outcomes, and -0.176 among behavioral outcomes. These small effect sizes suggest that the interventions were not effective. Moderator analyses results did not show any meaningful differences across the studies. Conclu- sions: Further research is needed to develop and im plement effective stress mana gement interventions in- tended for police officers and recruits that address specific field work, organizational and personal stressors, utilize randomized controlled trials, and indicate the primary, secondary or tertiary focus of the intervention. 37 Penalba V, McGuire H, Leite JR. Psychosocial interventions for prevention of psychological disorders in law enforcement officers. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. 2008(3):CD005601. Background: Psychosocial interventions are widely used for the prevention of psychological disorders in law enforcement officers. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of psychosocial in- terventions for the prevention of psychological disorders in law enforcement officers. Search strategy: CCDANCTR-References was searched on 12/5/2008, electronic databases were searched, reference lists of re- view articles and included studies were checked, a spec ialist journal was hand sear ched, specialist books were checked and we contacted experts and trial lists. Selection criteria: Randomised an d quasi randomised con- trolled trials were eligible. The types of participants were people employed directly in law enforcement, includ- ing police officers and military poli ce, regardless of gender, ag e and country of origin, and whether or not they had experienced some psychological trau ma. All types of psychosocial interv ention were eligible. The relevant outcome measures were psychological symptoms, adverse events and acceptability of interventions. Data col- lection and analysis: Data was entered into Review Mana ger 4.2 for analysis, but this review was converted to RevMan 5.0 for publication. Quality assessments were performed. Two authors inde pendently selected stud- ies, extracted data and assessed the quality of studies. Summary effects we re to be calculated using RevMan but no meta-analyses were possible. For individual studies, dichotomou s outcome data are presented using relative risk, and continuous outcome data are presented using the weighted mean difference. These results are given with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results: Ten studies were included in the review but only five reported data that could be used. Three of th e ten studies were related to exercise-based psychologi- cal interventions. Seven were related to psychological interventions. No meta-analyses were possible due to diversity of participants, interventi ons and outcomes. Two studies compared a psychosocial intervention ver- sus another intervention. Three studies compared a psycho social intervention to a control group. Only one pri- mary prevention trial reported data for the primary outc omes and, although this study found a significant dif- ference in depression in favor of the intervention at endpoint, this difference was no longer evident at 18 months. No studies of primary prevention comparing di fferent interventions and reporting primary outcomes of interest were identified. The meth odological quality of th e included studies was summarised. No study met our full quality criteria and one was regarded as low-quality. The remainde r could not be rated because of in- complete data in the published report s and inadequate responses from the trial lists. Authors' conclusions: There is evidence only from individual small and low qu ality trials with minimal data suggesting that police officers benefit from psychosocial interventions, in terms of physical symptoms and psychological symptoms 38 such as anxiety, depression, sleep problems, cynicism, an ger, PTSD, marital problems and distress. No data on adverse effects were available. Meta-analyses of the available data were not possible. Further well-designed trials of psychosocial interventions are required. Resear ch is needed on organization-based interventions to enhance psychological health among police officers. Tabell P. Are workplace health promotion programs effective at improv- ing presenteeism in workers? A systematic review and best evidence synthesis of the liter- ature. BMC Public Health. 2011;11:395. Background: Presenteeism is highly prevalent and costly to employers. It is defined as being present at work, but limited in some aspect of job performance by a health problem.Workplace health promotion (WHP) is a common strategy used to enhance on-the-job productivity. The primary objective is to determine if WHP pro- grams are effective in improving presenteeism. The secondary objectives are to identify characteristics of suc- cessful programs and potential risk factors for presenteeism. Methods: The Cochrane Library, Medline, and other electronic databases we re searched from 1990 to 2010. Reference lists were examined, key journals were hand-searched and experts were contacte d. Included studies were original research that contained data on at least 20 participants (> 18 years of age), and examined the impacts of WHP programs implemented at the workplace. The Effective Public Health Practice Project T ool for Quantitative Studies was used to rate studies. 'Strong' and 'moderate' studies were abstracted into evidence tables, and a best evidence synthesis was per- formed. Interventions were deemed successful if they improved the outcome of interest. Their program com- ponents were identified, as were possible risk factors co ntributing to presenteeism. Results: After 2,032 titles and abstracts were screened, 47 articles were reviewed, and 14 were accepted (4 strong and 10 moderate stud- ies). These studies contained preliminary evidence for a positive effect of some WHP programs. Successful programs offered organizational leader ship, health risk screening, indivi dually tailored programs, and a sup- portive workplace culture. Potential risk factors contri buting to presenteeism included being overweight, a 39 poor diet, a lack of exercise, high stress, and poor relations with co-workers and management. Limitations: This review is limited to English publications. A larg e number of reviewed studies (70%) were inadmissible due to issues of bias, thus limiting the amount of primary evidence. The uncertainties surrounding presentee- ism measurement is of significant concern as a source of bias. Conclusions: The presenteeism literature is young and heterogeneous. There is pr eliminary evidence that some WHP pr ograms can positively affect pres- enteeism and that certain risk factors are of importance . Future research would benefit from standard presen- teeism metrics and studies conducted acro ss a broad range of workplace settings. Joyce K, Pabayo R, Critchley JA, Bambra C. Flexible working conditions and their effects on employee health and wellbeing. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. 2010(2):CD008009. Background: Flexible working conditio ns are increasingly popular in developed countries but the effects on employee health and wellbeing are largely unknown. Objectives: To evaluate the effects (benefits and harms) of flexible working interventions on the physical, mental and general he alth and wellbeing of employees and their families. Search strategy: Our searches (July 2009) covered 12 data bases including the Cochrane Public Health Group Specialised Register relevant websites, handsearched key journals, searched bibliographies and contacted study authors and key experts. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCT), interrupted time series and controlled before and after studies (CBA), which examined the effects of flexible working interventions on employee health and wellbeing. We excluded studies assessing outcomes for less than six months and extracte d outcomes relating to physical, mental and general health/ill health measured using a validated instrument. We al so extracted secondary out- comes (including sickness absence, health service usage, behavioural changes, accidents, work-life balance, quality of life, health and wellbeing of children, family members and co-workers) if reported alongside at least one primary outcome. Data collection and analysis: Two experienced review authors conducted data extraction and quality appraisal. We undertook a narrative synt hesis as there was substantial heterogeneity between studies. Main results: Ten studies fulfilled the inclusio n criteria. Six CBA studies re ported on interventions re- lating to temporal flexibility: self-s cheduling of shift work (n = 4), flexti me (n = 1) and overtime (n = 1). The remaining four CBA studies evaluated a form of contractual flex ibility: partial/gradual retirement (n = 2), in- 40 voluntary part-time work (n = 1) and fixed-term contract (n = 1). The stud ies retrieved had a number of meth- odological limitations includ ing short follow-up periods, risk of select ion bias and reliance on largely self-re- ported outcome data. Four CBA studie s on self-scheduling of shifts and one CBA study on gradual/partial re- tirement reported statistically signif icant improvements in either primar y outcomes (including systolic blood pressure and heart rate; tiredness; me ntal health, sleep duration, sleep quality and alertness; self-rated health status) or secondary health outcomes (co-workers social support and sens e of community) and no ill health effects were reported. Flexitime was shown not to have significant effect s on self-reported physiological and psychological health outcomes. Simila rly, when comparing individuals wo rking overtime with those who did not the odds of ill health effects were not significantly higher in the intervention group at follow up. The effects of contractual flexibility on self-reported health (with the exception of gradual/partial re tirement, which when controlled by employees improved health outcomes) were either equivocal or negative. No studies differenti- ated results by socio-economic status , although one study did compare find ings by gender but found no differ- ential effect on self-reported health outcomes. Authors' conclusions: The findings of this review tentatively suggest that flexible working interven tions that increase worker control and choice (such as self-scheduling or gradual/partial retirement) are likely to have a positive effect on health outcomes . In contrast, interventions that were motivated or dictated by or ganisational interests, such as fixe d-term contract and involuntary part- time employment, found equivocal or negative health effects. Given the partial and methodol ogically limited evidence base these findings should be interpreted with caution. Moreover, there is a clear need for well-de- signed intervention studies to delineate the impact of flexible working conditions on health, wellbeing and health inequalities. Kim JH. A meta-analysis of effects of job stress management interventions (SMIs). Taehan Kanho Hakhoe Chi. 2007;37(4):529- 39. Purpose: This termine the effectiveness of SMIs. Method: Forty-six ex- perimental studies with a randomized or nonequivalent control group pre-posttest design were included in the analysis. The selected studies were classified according to the sample characteristic s, the types and methods of the interventions, and the types of outcome variables. Six intervention types were distinguished: cognitive- behavioral intervention (CBT ), relaxation techniques (R T), exercise (EX), multimodal programs 1 and 2(MT1, 2), and organization focused interventions (OTs). Effect sizes were calculated for the 4 outcome categories 41 across intervention types: psycho-social outcome, be havioral-personal resources, physiologic, and organiza- tional outcome. Results: Individual worker-focused interventions (ITs) were more effective than OTs. A small but significant overall effect was found. A moderate e ffect was found for RT, and sm all effects were found for other ITs. The effect size for OTs was the smallest. The interventions involving CBT and RT appeared to be the preferred means of reducing worker's psycho-social an d organizational outcomes. Wi th regard to physiologic outcomes, RT appeared to be most effective. CBT appeared to be most effective in reducing psycho-social out- comes. The effects of OT were non-significant, except for the psycho-social outcom es. Conclusions: SMIs are effective. Interventions involving RT and CBT are more effective than other types. Kuoppala J, Lamminpaa A, Husman P. Work health promotion, job well-being, and sickness absences - A systematic review and meta- analysis. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine. 2008;50(11):1216-27. Objective: The aim of this systematic literature analysis was to study the association between work health pro- motion and job well-being, work ability, absenteeism, an d early retirement. This systematic review is a part of a large research project studying mult iple workplace factors and intervention s that may affect workers' health and well-being. Methods: Original arti cles published in 1970 to 2005 were searched in Medline and PsycINFO databases, the main search terms bein g health promotion, well-b eing, work ability, sick leave, and disability pension. Out of 1312 references and 35 potentially eligible publications, 10 studies were included in the analy- sis. Other sources producing 36 eligible studies, 46 st udies in total were included in the analysis. Results: There is moderate evidence that work health promotion decreases sickness absences (risk ratio (RR), 0.78; range, 0.10 to 1.57) and work ability ( RR, 1.38; range, 1.15 to 1.66). It also seems to increase mental well-being (RR, 1.39; range, 0.98 to 1.91), but not physical well-being. There is no evidence on disability pension. Exercise seems to increase overall well-being (RR, 1.25; range, 1. 05 to 1.47) and work ability (RR, 1.38; range, 1.15 to 1.66), but education and psychological methods do not seem to affect well-being or sickness absences. Sickness absences seem to be reduced by activities promoting heal thy lifestyle (RR, 0.80; range, 0.74 to 0.93) and ergo- nomics (RR, 0.72; range, 0. 13 to 1.57). Conclusions: Work health pr omotion is valuable on employees' well- being and work ability and productive in terms of less si ckness absences. Activities in volving exercise, lifestyle, and ergonomics are potentially effective. On the other hand, education and psychological means applied alone do not seem effective. Work health promotion should target both physica l and psychosocial environments at work. 42 McLeod J. The effectiveness of workplace counselling: A systematic review. Counselling & Psychotherapy Research. 2010;10(4):238-48. Background: In response to the stre sses of the contemporary workplace, the challenges of maintaining satis- factory work-life balance, and the costs to business of employee mental health pr oblems, many organisations have contracted to make counselling serv ices available to their staff. It is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of workplace counselling, in order to maintain standards, and to identify examples of good practice. Objec- tives: This paper presents a comprehensive, systematic review of the effectiveness of workplace counselling. Findings are analysed in terms of client satisfaction, psychological functioning, th e meaning of work, work be- haviour, and negative outcom es. Findings: Taken as a whole, the results of research suggest that counselling is generally effective in alleviating psychological problems, has a significant impact on sickness absence, and has a moderate effect on attitudes to work. Discussion: Me thodological issues are discussed, and it is recom- mended that more high-quality research is required in order to reinforce the ev idence base for workplace counselling in relation to a number of key questions. Montano D, Hoven H, Siegrist J. A meta-analysis of health of randomized controlled worksite interventions: does social stratification matter? Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health. 2014;40(3):230-4. Objectives: The aim of this review was to assess what types of socioeconomic positions (SEP) are being consid- ered in randomized controlled intervention studies and estimate the moderation of SEP in workplace interven- tion effects on body mass index (BMI), fruit and vege table consumption, musculoskeletal symptoms, and job stress. Methods: A meta-analysis of randomized contro lled workplace intervention s was undertaken. Studies were classified by participants' SEP. The overall st andardized mean difference (SMD) for each outcome was estimated with random-effects models. Additionally, a ra ndom-effects model with SEP as moderating variable was calculated in order to assess intervention effect modi fication (EM). Results: This review covers 36 studies. Altogether 40 reports of intervention effects were considered. The overall mean differences in the models, without SEP as moderating variable, were significant for all outcomes. BMI, self-reported musculoskeletal symptoms, and self-reported job stress fruit and vegetables increased (SMD 0.12, 95% CI 0.01-0.22). Th ere were no statisti cally significant dif- ferences between occupational classes for CI -1.208-0.012, respectively). Conclusions: Workplace interventions can achieve small positive effects on major health outcomes. We could not confirm whether these effects are moderated by occupational class.

Studies in health technology and informatics. 2014;200:71-80. Problem: Stress-related disorders have become one of th e main problems of public health in many countries and of worldwide organizations, and they are expected to become more common in the forthcoming decades. Objective: This article aims at prov iding a systematic review and a descri ptive evaluation of the interventions supported by ICT for the prevention and treatment of occupational stress. Method s: A systematic review of five databases (EBSCO, The Cochrane Library, PubMed , ScienceDirect and IEEEXplor er) was carried out. Re- sults: This article provides a quantitative and qualitat ive description of 21 studies about occupational stress interventions supported by ICT. The following factors were considered for the analysis: impact of the interven- tion, design of the study, type of in tervention, purpose of the intervention , type of instrument for the measure- ment of occupational stress, and type of ICT used. Conclusions: The systematic review demonstrated that in- terventions supported by ICT for the prevention and trea tment of occupational stress are scarce but effective. Ost LG. The efficacy of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy: an updated systematic review and meta- analysis. Behaviour research and therapy. 2014;61:105-21. Acceptance and Commitment therapy (ACT) has attracted a lot of interest during the last 10-15 years with a strong increase of the number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The present review and meta-analysis includes 60 RCTs (4234 participants ) on psychiatric disorders, somatic disorders, and stress at work. The mean effect size across all comparis ons was small (0.42). Compared to th e \u00d6st (2008) meta-analysis there was no significant improvement in method ological quality and deterioration in effect size (from 0.68). When ACT was compared to various forms of cognitive or behavioral treatments a small and non-significant effect size of 0.16 was obtained. An evidence-base evaluation showed that ACT is not yet well-established for any disorder. It is probably efficacious for chronic pain and tinn itus, possibly efficacious fo r depression, psychotic symp- toms, OCD, mixed anxiety, drug abuse, and stress at work, and experimental for the remaining disorders. 44 Rongen A, Robroek SJ, van Lenthe FJ, Burdorf A. Workplace health promotion: a meta-analysis of effectiveness. American journal of preventive medicine. 2013;44(4):406-15. Context: An unhealthy lifestyle may cont ribute to ill health, absence due to sickness, productivity loss at work, and reduced ability to work. Workplace health promot ion programs (WHPPs) aim to improve lifestyle and consequently improve health, work ab ility, and work productivity. Howeve r, systematic reviews on interven- tion studies have reported small effects, and the overall evaluation of effectiveness of WHPPs is hampered by a large heterogeneity in interventions and study population s. This systematic review ai ms to investigate the in- fluence of population, study and interv ention characteristics, and study quality on the effectiveness of work- place health promotion progra ms. Evidence acquisition: A systematic li terature search was conducted identify- ing RCTs, published before June 2012 , evaluating the effect of a WHPP aimed at smoking cessation, physical activity, healthy nutrition, and/or obesity on self-p erceived health, work absence due to sickness, work productivity, or work ability. Studies were included in the meta-analyses if quantitative information was pre- sent to calculate an effect size (E S). A meta-analysis, stratified meta-a nalyses, and meta-regression analyses were performed in Spring 2012 using Comprehensive Me ta-analysis software 2.0 and PAWS 17.0.2. Evidence synthesis: In 18 studies describing 21 interventions, the overall effect of a WHPP was small (ES=0.24, 95% CI=0.14, 0.34). The effectiveness of a WHPP was larger in younger populations, in interventions with weekly contacts, and in studies in which the control group received no health pr omotion. A 2.6-fold lower effective- ness was observed for studies performing an intention- to-treat analysis and a 1.7-fold lower effectiveness for studies controlling for confounders. St udies of poor methodolog ical quality reported a 2.9-fold higher effect size of the WHPP. Conclusions: The effectiveness of a WH PP is partly determined by intervention characteris- tics and statistical analysis. High-quality RCTs reported lower effect sizes. It is important to determine the ef- fectiveness of WHPPs in RCTs of high quality. Klink JJ, Blonk RW, Schene AH, van Dijk FJ. The benefits of interventions for work-related stress. American journal of public health. 2001;91(2):270-6. Objectives: This quantitative meta-ana lysis sought to determine the effectiv eness of occupational stress-reduc- ing interventions and the po pulations for which such interventions ar e most beneficial. Methods: Forty-eight experimental studies (n = 3736) were included in the analysis. Four intervention types were distinguished: cognitive-behavioral interventions, relaxation techniques, multimodal programs, and organization-focused interventions. Results: A small but significant overall e ffect was found. A moderate effect was found for cogni- 45 tive-behavioral interventions and mult imodal interventions, and a small e ffect was found for relaxation tech- niques. The effect size for organization-focused inte rventions was no significant. Effects were most pro- nounced on the following outcome categories: complain ts, psychological resources and responses, and per- ceived quality of work life. Conclusions: Stress manage ment interventions are effective. Cognitive-behavioral interventions are more effective than the other intervention types. Virgili M. Mindfulness-based interventions reduce psychological distress in working adults: A meta- analysis of intervention studies. Mindfulness. 2015;6(2):326-37. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) for reducing psychological distress in working adults. A comprehensive literature search of relevant databases included ar- ticles written in English published on December 2012 . The meta-analysis included 19 controlled and uncon- trolled intervention studies with a total of 1,139 part icipants. Analyses yielded me dium-to-large mean effect sizes for the within-group (pre-post) comparison (Hedge s's g = 0.68, 95 % confiden ce interval (CI) (0.58, 0.78)) and for the g = 0.68, 95 % CI (0.48, 0.88)) comparison of MBI with an inac- tive control. Effectiveness was largel y maintained at a median follow-up of 5 weeks (Hedges's g = 0.60, 95 % CI (0.46, 0.75)). Analyses based on subgroup comparisons suggested that brief versions of mindfulness-based stress reduction developed for organisational settings ar e equally effective as standard 8-week versions origi- nally developed for clinical settings. Ho wever, there is little evidence to suggest that MBIs are more effective than other types of occupati onal stress management interventions, such as relaxation training and yoga, for reducing psychological distress in working adults. Overall, these findings support the use of MBIs in organisa- tional settings for the reduction of p sychological distress. Implications for practice and research are discussed. 46 L, D. Supporting di- rect care workers in dementia care: effects of a psychoeduca- tional intervention. Am J Alz- heimers Dis Other Demen. 2015;30(2):130-8. An experimental study using a pre-post test control group design was conduc ted to assess the effects of a per- son-centered care-based psychoeducational intervention on direct care workers' stress, burnout, and job satis- faction. The intervention aimed to develop person-cen tered care competences and tools for stress manage- ment. Four aged care facilities were randomly assigned to a psychoeducational or an education-only interven- tion (control). Data were collected from 56 direct care workers (female, mean age 44.72 +/- 9.02) through measurements of burnout (Maslach Bu rnout Inventory), job satisfaction (Minnesota Satisfaction Question- naire-short form), and stress (Perceived Stress Scale) and focus-group interviews. Results showed significant positive effects in emotional exhaustion (P =.029) and po sitive but no significant effects in stress and job satis- faction. According to qualitative data, the experimental group perceived enhanced group cohesion, emotional management, and self-care awareness. Psychoeducational interventions may contribute to reduce direct care workers' burnout. Further work is needed to determine the extent of its benefits.

Effects of a 105 hours psychological train- ing program on attitudes, communication skills and oc- cupational stress in oncology: a randomised study. Br J Can- cer. 2004;90(1):106-14. The present study was designed to assess the impact of a PTP on HCP stress, at titudes and CS, and on HCP and patients' satisfaction with HCP co mmunication skills in a randomised study. A total of 115 oncology nurses were randomly assigned to a 105-h PTP or to a waiting li st. Stress was assessed with the Nursing Stress Scale, attitudes with a Semantic Differential Questionnaire, CS used during one simulated and one actual patient in- terview with the Cancer Research Ca mpaign Workshop Evaluation Manual, and satisfaction with the nurses' CS with a questionnaire completed by the patients and the nurses. Trained (TG) and control (CG) groups were compared at baseline, after 3 months (just following tr aining for TG) and after 6 months (3 months after the end of training for TG). Compared to controls, trained nurses reported positive changes on their stress levels (P</=0.05) and on their attitudes (P</ =0.05). Positive training effects were found on CS used during the sim- ulated interview: a significant P</=0.05). Less positive training effe cts were found regarding interviews with a cancer pa- tient: a significant increase in educated guesses (P</=0.001) was noticed. No training effect was observed on nurses' satisfaction levels, but a positive training effect was found on patients' satisfaction levels (P</=0.01). Although results outline PTP efficacy, they indicate the ne ed to design PTP, amplifying the transfer of learned CS to clinical practice. Ewers P, Bradshaw T, McGov- ern J, Ewers, B. Does training in psychosocial interventions reduce burnout rates in foren- sic nurses? J Adv Nurs 2002;37(5):470-6 Aim: To evaluate the effect of Psychosocial Intervention Training (PSI) on the know ledge, attitudes and levels of clinical burnout in a group of fo rensic mental health nurses. Design: Baseline assessments of knowledge, attitude and burnout were co mpleted by asking a group of 33 nurses working in a medium secure psychiatric unit to complete questionnaires. Twenty of the nurses vo lunteered to be included in a PSI training course and were randomly allocated either to receive the training or to a waiting list control group. The duration of the training was 6 months and on completion subjects in the experimental and control group completed the ques- tionnaires again. Results: Staff in the experimental group showed significant improvements in their knowledge and attitudes about serious mental illness and a significan t decrease in burnout rates, whilst staff in the con- trol group showed a small but no significant improvemen t in knowledge and attitudes, and increase in burn- out. Conclusion: The findings suggest that providing forensic mental health nurses with a better understand- ing of serious mental illness and traini ng them in a broader range of interventions, helps them to be more pos- itive in their attitudes towards the clients that they work with and experience less negative effects of stress re- sulting from their caring role. The implications of this study for cl inical practice and future research will be discussed. Feicht T, Wittmann M, Jose G, Mock A, von Hirschhausen E, Esch T. Evaluation of a seven- week web-based happiness training to improve psycho- logical well-being, reduce Objective. We examined the impact of a web-based ha ppiness training on psycholo gical and physiological and an oc cupational health setting. Methods. Randomized con- trolled trial with 147 employees. Participants were di vided into intervention (ha ppiness training) and control groups (waiting list). The interventi on consisted of a seven-week online training. Questionnaires were admin- istered before, after, and four weeks after training. Th e following scales were included: VAS (happiness and satisfaction), WHO-5 Well-being Inde x, Stress Warning Signals, Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory, Recovery 48 stress, and enhance mindful- ness and flourishing: a ran- domized controlled study. Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2013:676953. Experience Questionnaire, and Flourishing Scale. Subgro up samples for saliva cort isol and alpha-amylase de- terminations were taken, indicating stress, and Attent ion Network Testing for effects on attention regulation. Results. Happiness (P = 0.000; d = 0.93), satisfaction (P = 0.000; d = 1.17), and quality of life (P = 0.000; d = 1.06) improved; perceived stress was reduced (P = 0.003; d = 0.64); mindfulness (P = 0.006; d = 0.62), flour- ishing (P = 0.002; d = 0.63), and re covery experience (P = 0.030; d = 0.42 ) also increased significantly. No significant differences in the Attentio n Network Tests and saliva results oc curred (intergroup), except for one saliva value. Conclusions. The web-based training can be a useful tool for stabilizin g health/psychol ogical well- being and work/life balance. Haslam D, Sanders M, Sofron- off K. Reducing Work and Family Conflict in Teachers: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Workplace Triple P. School Mental Health. 2013;5(2):70- 82. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a workplace parenting intervention aimed at reducing work-family conflict and improving wo rk and family functioning in teache rs. One hundred and seven teachers (who were also parents) were randomly allocated to ei ther a Workplace Triple P intervention condition or a waitlist control condition. Analyses in dicated the intervention had a positive effect on a range of occupational variables including work-to-family conflict, family-to-wo rk conflict, occupational stress and teaching efficacy. Intervention effects were also found for family- and pe rsonal adjustment-related variables including dysfunc- tional parenting styles, child behaviour, parenting efficacy, and depression and anxiety. Small to large effect sizes were obtained (Cohen's d = .34-.85), and all intervention effects were maintained at 4-month follow-up. The results indicate that a parenting intervention can reduce work-family conflict and occupational stress and improve family functioning in teachers balancing work and family. The implicatio ns for supporting teachers with family interventions delivere d in the workplace are discussed. Horan AP. An effective work- place stress management in- tervention: Chicken Soup for the Soul at Work Employee Groups. Work. 2002;18(1):3- 13. Stress is a costly and significant source of health prob lems and mental distress--with work cited as a primary stressor. This pilot study supports the effectiveness of a new workplace stress inte rvention: Chicken Soup for the Soul at Work Employee Groups. In this program, employee-participant s met during nine weekly meetings to read inspirational workplace stories, comment, and sh are their own stories. A leader, chosen from and by the group, guided meetings. Utilizing a wait-list control group design, partic ipants were randomly assigned to 49 an experimental or wait-list group. Participants co mpleted pretests and posttests (Coping Resources Inven- tory, Occupational Stress Inventory-Revised, Job Descri ptive Index, Pressure Management Indicator, survey). Statistical interaction effect for subt ests was evaluated using a two-way repeated measures analysis of vari- ance. Participants exhibited improved total coping reso urces, cognitive/rational co ping, state of mind, confi- dence and home/work balance. Participant comments an d their continued participation in a similar company- sponsored program bolster these empirical results. Poulsen AA, Sharpley CF, Baumann KC, Henderson J, Poulsen MG. Evaluation of the effect of a 1-day interventional workshop on recovery from job stress for radiation therapists and oncology nurses: A randomised trial. Journal of Medical Imaging and Radiation Oncology. 2015;59(4):491-8. Introduction Cancer care workers experience high levels of occupational stress th at can have adverse mental and physical health consequences. Educating health prof essionals about self-care practices throughout their careers can potentially build resilience. Our study aimed to evaluate the effects of an educational intervention to improve recovery from job stress, increase satisfac tion with current self-care practices and improve sleep quality. Methods An equivalent, randomised comparison, pretest-post-test intervention design was used to investigate the effects of a 1-day workshop (plus educat ional material) compared with written educational ma- terial alone, on measures of recove ry experiences (i.e. psychological detachment from work, relaxation, mas- tery experiences and control over leisure), satisfaction with recovery-related self-care practices and perceived sleep quality of 70 cancer care wo rkers. Results Workshop participants reported greater mean changes 6 weeks post-workshop for total recovery experiences (F(1,69) = 8.145, P = .008) , self-care satisfaction (F(1,69) = 8.277, P = .005) and perceived sleep quality (F(1,69) = 9.611, P = .003). Th ere was a decline in the scores of the control group over the 6-week period for all measur es. Workshop participants not only avoided this de- cline, but demonstrated increased mean scores, with a significant main effect 6 weeks post-workshop, com- pared with the control group (F(3,63) = 4.262, P = .0 08). Conclusions A 1-day intervention workshop im- proved recovery skills, satisfaction with self-care prac tices and perceived sleep qual ity of oncology nurses and radiation therapists. Outcomes were enhanced when part icipants actively participat ed in experiential group- based learning compared with receiving written material alone. This intervention has the potential to enhance resilience and prevent burnout at different points in a cancer worker's career. 50 Redhead K, Bradshaw T, Braynion P, Doyle M. An evaluation of the outcomes of psychosocial intervention training for qualified and unqualified nursing staff working in a low-secure mental health unit. Journal of psychiatric and mental health nursing. 2011;18(1):59-66. Psychosocial intervention (PSI) training results in en hanced knowledge, more positive attitudes, increased confidence and lower levels of clinical burnout for qual ified mental health professi onals and better outcomes for service users who they work with. This paper describe s an evaluation of a PSI training course for qualified and unqualified nurses working in a lo w-secure unit. Forty-two staff (21 qualified) were randomly allocated to an experimental training group or a waiting list cont rol group. Knowledge, attitudes and burnout were as- sessed before and after the training. In addition, a rand om sample of 44 care plan s written by the qualified nurses were audited before and after to examine evidence of implementation of PSI in practice. Qualified and unqualified nurses in the experiment al group showed significant improv ements in knowledge and attitudes compared with the control group. Care plans showed a significant increase in the implementation of PSI. The only significant change in burnout was a reduction in depersonalization for qualif ied nurses in the experi- mental group. The PSI training may result in improvements in knowledge, attitude and practice in qualified and unqualified nurses working with seve rely mentally ill patients in low-secure settings, but in this study the training did not incur protection against burnout. Ruehl BD. The psychological and physical heatlh effects of written emotional expression in pediatric hematology/oncology, intensive care, and neonatal intensive care nursing staff: Alliant International University; 2013. The primary goal of this randomized, controlled study was to determine the effects of expressive writing on physical and psychological stress, occupational burnout, absenteeism, and coping beha viors in a population of nurses, considered to be most at risk for negative ph ysical, psychological, and be havioral outcomes. The study applied the written emotional expression intervention developed by Pennebaker (1986) to a group of nurses as compared to a control group condition of similar nurs es. Outcome measures of depression, physical illness and physician visits, work absenteeism, mood, job satisf actions, and secondary traumatic stress were exam- ined. There were no significant inte raction findings in any of the abov e constructs, however examination of group means indicate trends of impr ovement over time in the experiment al condition on depression, physical health symptoms, and intrusive sympto ms of secondary traumatic stress.

Free choice access to multipoint wellness Objective: Examine effects of volunt ary participation in employer-spons ored, multipoint wellness education programming on employee wellness. Methods: A random ized and controlled design was used to organize 96 participants into an education + access group; an access-only group, and control group. Outcome measures 51 education and related services positively impacts employee wellness: a randomized and controlled trial. J Occup Environ Med. 2012;54(4):471- 7. were made at start and end of a 12-week intervention period. Results: Education + access improved wellness knowledge, which, in turn, enhanced life satisfaction, employee morale, and energy, and nearly improved stress level. Those who rece ived facility access without educational programming did not reap health benefits. Employees voluntarily used the fitness facility and heal thy meal cards only 1.3 and 1.5 times per week, respec- tively. Conclusions: Participants made limited and likely inadequate use of wellness opportunities. As a result, physical health benefits (e.g., blood pr essure, fitness parameters) were not se en in the present study. However, multipoint wellness education re sulted in psychosocial health benefits in 12 weeks. Takao S, Tsutsumi A, Nishiuchi K, Mineyama S, Kawakami N. Effects of the job stress education for supervisors on psychological distress and job performance among their immediate subordinates: a supervisor- based randomized controlled trial. Journal of occupational health. 2006;48(6):494-503. As job stress is now one of the biggest health-related problems in the workplace, several education programs for supervisors have been conducted to reduce job stress. We cond ucted a supervisor-based randomized con- trolled trial to evaluate the effects of an education program on their subordinates' psychological distress and job performance. The subjects were 301 employees (46 supervisors and 255 subordinates) in a Japanese sake brewery. First, we randomly allocated supervisors to th e education group (24 supervis ors) and the waiting-list group (22 supervisors). Then, for the allocated supervis ors we introduced a single-session, 60-min education program according to the guidelines fo r employee mental health promotion along with training that provided consulting skills combined with ro le-playing exercises. We conducted pre- and post-intervention (after 3 months) surveys for all subordinates to examine psycho logical distress and job performance. We defined the intervention group as those subordinates whose immediate supervisors received the education, and the control group was defined as those subordinat es whose supervisors did not. To ev aluate the effects, we employed a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Overall, the intervention effects (time x group) were not sig- nificant for psychological distress or job performanc e among both male (p=0.456 and 0.252) and female (p=0.714 and 0.106) subordinates. Ho wever, young male subordinates en gaged in white-collar occupations showed significant intervention effects for psychologica l distress (p=0.012) and job performance (p=0.029). In conclusion, our study indicated a possi ble beneficial effect of supervisor education on the psychological dis- tress and job performance of subordinates. This effect may vary accordin g to specific groups. 52 Wallbank S. Effectiveness of individual clinical supervision for midwives and doctors in stress reduction: findings from a pilot study. Evidence Based Midwifery. 2010;8(2):65-70. Background. A recent study designed to examine the re sponses of maternity staff to loss experienced through their work, concluded that staff working in these areas can experience significant clinic al levels of stress (Wall- bank, 2007). Supporting staff to process and normalise their workplace experiences may help them better care for themselves and the women and families under their care. Aim. To examine the effectiveness of clinical su- pervision in reducing staff stress. Su pervision in this context was not desi gned to assess clinical competence, but a tool to assist staff with the emotional demands of their work. Methods. In total, 157 participants were invited to participate in this pilot study, 30 agreed and were randomly assigned to a control or treatment group. Participants within the contro l group received no intervention. Part icipants randomly assigned to the treatment group received clin ical supervision for an average of six sessi ons with a clinical psychologist. Partici- pants completed measures to assess levels of subjective stress, burnout, compassion fatigue and compassion satisfaction. Conclusion. Results for the treatment group showed significant differences in subjective stress, with average scores decreasing from 29 to 7 (p<.0001); compassion satisfaction average scores increased from 37 to 41 (p=.001); burnout average scores decreased from 27 to 14 (p<.0001); compassion fatigue average scores decreased from 16 to 12 (p=0.004). Systematic, individual clinical supervis ion appears to have a posi- tive impact on the reduction of stress for staff working in obstetrics and gynecology. Zhai F, Raver C, Li-Grining C. Classroom-based interventions and teachers' perceived job stressors and confidence: Evidence from a randomized trial in Head Start settings. Early Childhood Research Quarterly. 2011;26(4):442-52. Preschool teachers' job stressors have received increasing attention but have been understudied in the litera- ture. We investigated the impacts of a classroom-based intervention, the Chicago School Readiness Project (CSRP), on teachers' perceived job stre ssors and confidence, as indexed by th eir perceptions of job control, job resources, job demands, and confidence in behavior management. Using a clustered randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, the CSRP provided multifaceted services to the treatment group, including teacher training and mental health consultation, which were accompanied by stress-reduction services and workshops. Overall, 90 teachers in 35 classrooms at 18 Head Start sites pa rticipated in the study. Af ter adjusting for teacher and classroom factors and site fixed effect s, we found that the CSRP had signif icant effects on the improvement of teachers' perceived job control and work-related resource s. We also found that the CSRP decreased teachers' confidence in behavior management and had no statisti cally significant effects on job demands. Overall, we 53 did not find significant moderation e ffects of teacher race/ethnicity, educat ion, teaching experience, or teacher type. The implications for research and policy are discussed.

Coming to grips with challenging behaviour: A cluster randomised controlled trial on the effects of a new care programme for challenging behaviour on burnout, job satisfaction and job demands of care staff on dementia special care units. International Journal of Nursing Studies. 2015;52(1):68-74. Background: Caring for people with de mentia in dementia spec ial care units is a dema nding job. Challenging behaviour is one of the factors influe ncing the job satisfaction and burnout of care staff. A care programme for the challenging behaviour of nursing home residents with dementia might, next to diminishing the challenging behaviour of residents, improve job sati sfaction and reduce the care staff's feelings of burnout. Objectives: To determine the effects of a care programme for the challenging behaviour of nursing home residents with de- mentia on the burnout, job satisfacti on and job demands of care staff. Design: The care programme was imple- mented according to a stepped wedge design in which care units were randomly divided over five groups with different time points of starting with implementation. Setting: 17 Dutch dementia special care units. Partici- pants: Care staff members of the 17 units. Intervention: The care programme consists of an education package and of various structured assessment tools that guide professionals through the mu ltidisciplinary detection, analysis, treatment and evaluation of treatment of challenging behaviour. Methods: Burnout, job satisfaction and job demands were measured before implementati on, halfway through the implementation process and after all the care units had implemented the care prog ramme. Burnout was measured with the Dutch version of the Maslach burnout inventory (UBO S-C, three subscales); job satisfaction and job demands were measured with subscales of the Leiden Quality of Work Questionnaire. Mixed model analyses were used to determine effects. Care staff could not be blinded for the interven tion. Results: Of the 1441 questionnaires, 645 were re- turned (response 45%, 318 control measurements, 327 in tervention measurements) by 380 unique care staff members. Significant effects were found on job satisfac tion (0.93, 95% CI 0.48-1.3 8). On the other outcomes, no significant changes in the scores were found. Conclu sion: Positive effects of using the Grip on Challenging behaviour care programme were found on job sati sfaction, without an increase in job T, Roizen M. P02.63. Efficacy of an 8- week online mindfulness stress management program in a corporate call center. BMC Complementary and Al- ternative Medicine 2012, 12(Suppl 1):P119. Authors evaluated the effectiveness of an 8-week online mindfulness stress reduction (OSR) program in reduc- ing work related stress and burnout and in improving well -being in a corporate call center. We also evaluated whether 1-hour weekly group practice and experience sharing at the workplace would improve program reten- tion and engagement. Methods: 161 participants were wait-list control (CTL, N=37), (OSR+grp, N=70). The Perceived Stress Scale, Maslach Burnout Inventory (professional efficacy and exhaustion subs cales), Mindful Attention Awareness Scale and SF36 (emotional well-being and role functioning subscales) we re administered at baseline , post intervention and at 8-week follow-up. Results: We observed overall a greate r post intervention decrease in stress and exhaustion and increase in mindfulness, emotional well-being and ro le functioning in the OSR+gr p (cohen d=1.3, 0.8, 0.6, 1.4 respectively) compared to OSR (d=1 , 0.4, 0.5, 0.8) and wait-list contro l (d<0.4). This overall improvement was also maintained at follow-up fo r most measures. The improvement was significantly greater for the OSR compared to CTL for stress and emotional well-being, an d for OSR+grp compared to CTL for all outcomes ex- cept for professional efficacy. OSR +grp improved sign ificantly more than OSR for stress, emotional wellbeing and emotional role functioning. Weekly group practice significantly increased program engagement and re- duced dropout rate (13% for OSR +grp compared to 55% for OSR). Conclusion: An online mindfulness stress management program when combined with weekly group practice can offer a practical and cost-effective ap- proach to decrease stress and burnout and improv e mindfulness and well-being at the workplace. Ancona M & Mendelson T. Feasibility and preliminary outcomes of a yoga and mind- fulness intervention for school teachers. Advances in School Many public school teachers face formidable challenges, in cluding overcrowded classrooms, limited adminis- trative resources, and high numbers of students with behavioral and emotional problems. Mindfulness-based strategies are a potentially promising means of reducing teachers' stress and enhancing their ability to handle job demands effectively. This pilot ra ndomized study assessed the feasibility and preliminary outcomes of a 6- session yoga and mindfulness program for teachers developed by the Holi stic Life Foundation, a local non- profit organization. Seven urban public schools were randomly assigned either to receive the intervention or to 55 Mental Health Promotion. 2014;7(3):156-170. a no-intervention control condition. A volunteer sample of teachers within those sc hools participated in the study, with 21 teachers attending the intervention and 22 teachers in the control arm. Intervention feasibility was assessed by examining recruitment response and in tervention attendance and by gathering qualitative feedback from intervention instructor s and participants. Participants also completed self-report measures of stress and burnout at baseline and post-test to provid e preliminary information ab out intervention effects. Findings suggest the intervention may be beneficial for some teachers, but our recruitment response also high- lighted feasibility challenges. Reco mmendations are presented for enhancing program feasibility and for ad- vancing research on the use of yoga and mindfulness with teachers.

Effectiveness of a mindfulness education program in primary health care professionals: a pragmatic controlled trial. J Contin Educ Health Prof. 2014;34(1):4-12. Introduction: Burnout is a very prevalent type of stress among health professionals. It affects their well-being, performance, and attitude toward patients. This study as sessed the effectiveness of a training program for pri- mary health care professionals designed to reduce bu rnout and mood disturbance, increase empathy, and de- velop mindfulness. Methods: Pragmatic randomized cont rolled trial with pre- and post-intervention measure- ments of 68 primary health care professionals (43 in th e intervention and 25 in the control group) in Spain. The intervention consisted of presentations of clinically relevant topics, mindfulness-based coping strategies, mindfulness practice, yoga, and group discussions (8 sessi ons of 2.5 hours per week plus a 1-day session of 8 hours). Outcome measures included the Maslach Burnout In ventory, Profile of Mood States, Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy, Baer's Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire, and a questionnaire on changes in personal habits and mindfulness practice. Measurements were pe rformed at baseline and after 8 weeks. Results: The intervention group improved in the 4 scales measured. The magnitude of the change was large in total mood disturbance (difference between groups -7.1; standardized effect-size (SES) 1.15) and mindfulness (difference between groups 11; SES 0.9) and moderate in the burn out (difference between groups -7; SES 0.74) and empa- thy scales (difference between groups 5.2; SES 0.71). No significant differences were found in the control group. Discussion: Our study supports the use of mindfu lness-based programs as pa rt of continuing profes- sional education to reduce and prevent burnout, prom ote positive attitudes amon g health professionals, strengthen patient-provider relationships, and enhance well-being. 56 Bostock S & Steptoe A. Can finding headspace reduce work stress? A randomised controlled workplace trial of a mindfulness meditation app. Psychosomatic Medicine 2013;75 (3):A36-A37. We investigated whether mindfulness training using a smartphone app influenced work stress, blood pressure and hair cortisol. Methods: 120 healthy employees from a UK pharma company were recruited. At baseline participants completed a questionna ire assessing work stress (Karasek model), wellbeing (WEMWBS), anxiety and depression (HADS) and mindfulness (FMI). A hair sa mple was taken. BP was measured with a wrist mon- itor 5 times over a work day. Participants were rand omised to Group 1 (n=65, a pp group) or Group 2 (n=55, waitlist control). The app consisted of a 45-day pr ogramme of 10-20 minute audio mindfulness exercises (www. getsomeheadspace.com). After 8 weeks all measures were repeated at interview. Group 2 then received the app. An online questionnaire was distributed 18 we eks post baseline. Results: 8 weeks 115 participants (96%) completed follow-up. Group 1 spent an average 25 2min listening to meditati on (range 0-725min). The intervention was associated with significant improvem ents in job control, reduced anxiety and depressive symptoms (Table). There was a dose-res ponse relationship between time medi tating and gains in mindfulness, well-being and job control (p<0.01) but not with job demands. Mean BP fell by 1.7/2.1mmHg (SBP/DBP) in Group 1 and by 0.7/0.1mmHg in Group 2. In a model ad justed for age, sex and BMI, the difference in DBP over time between groups was significant (Figure). Hair cortisol concentration did not differ between groups. 18 weeks 75 (65%) completed a questionnaire. Psycholo gical measures were stable for Group 1 respondents. Group 2 responded to the app similarly to Group 1. Conc lusions: Self-administered mindfulness training with an app is a feasible method for improving psychologica l wellbeing at work and may reduce blood pressure. The employer in this trial is now using this app with other employees. Public downloads of the app exceed 150,000. Duchemin, A, Steinberg, B, Marks, D, Vanover K, Klatt M. A small randomized pilot study of a workplace mindful- ness-based intervention for surgical intensive care unit personnel: effects on salivary alpha-amylase levels. Journal Objective: To determine whether a workplace stress-red uction intervention decreases reactivity to stress among personnel exposed to a highly stressful occupation al environment. Methods: Personnel from a surgical intensive care unit were rand omized to a stress-reduction intervention or a waitlist control group. The 8-week group mindfulness-based intervention included mindfuln ess, gentle yoga, and musi c. Psychological and bio- logical markers of stress were measured 1 week before an d 1 week after the intervention. Results: Levels of sal- ivary alpha-amylase, an index of sympathetic activati on, were significantly decreased between the first and 57 of Occupational & Environ- mental Medicine 2015;57(4):393-9. second assessments in the intervention group with no changes in the control group. There was a positive cor- relation between salivary alpha-amylase levels and burnout scores. Conclusions: These data suggest that this type of intervention could decrease not only reac tivity to stress but also the risk of burnout. Flaxman P & Bond F. Worksite stress management training: moderated effects and clinical significance. J Oc- cup Health Psychol Oct 2010;15(4):347-58. Psychologically healthy participants may dilute the observed effects of worksite stress management training (SMT) programs, therefore hiding the true effectiveness of these interventions for more distressed workers. To examine this issue, 311 local government employees were randomly assigned to SMT based on acceptance and commitment therapy (SMT, n = 177) or to a waitlist co ntrol group (n = 134). The SMT program consisted of three half-day training sessions, and imparted a mixture of mindfulness and values-based action skills. Across a 6-month assessment period, SMT resulted in a signific ant reduction in employee di stress. As predicted, the impact of SMT was significantly modera ted by baseline distress, such that meaningful effects were found only among a subgroup of initially distress ed workers. Furthermore, a majority (69%) of these initially distressed SMT participants improved to a clinically significant degree. The study highlights the importance of account- ing for sample heterogeneity when evaluating and classifying worksite SMT programs. Flook L, Goldberg S, Pinger L, Bonus K, Davidson R. Mind- fulness for teachers: A pilot study to assess effects on stress, burnout and teaching efficacy. Mind Brain Educ. 2013;7(3). This study reports results from a randomized controlled pilot trial of a modified Mindfulness-Based Stress Re- duction course (mMBSR) adapted specif ically for teachers. Results suggest that the course may be a promising intervention, with participants showing significant re ductions in psychological symptoms and burnout, im- provements in observer-rated classroom organization an d performance on a computer task of affective atten- tional bias, and increases in self-compassion. In contrast , control group participants showed declines in corti- sol functioning over time and margin ally significant increases in burnou t. Furthermore, changes in mindful- ness were correlated in the expected direction with changes across severa l outcomes (psychological symptoms, burnout, and sustained attention) in the intervention grou p. Implications of these fi ndings for the training and support of teachers are discussed. 58 Klatt M, Norre C, White S. The efficacy of an English-to- Danish translation of a low- dose mindfulness workplace intervention for Scandinavian bank employees on stress. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine. 2012;12. Purpose: To determine the impact of a low-dose mindfulness based intervention, translated from English to Danish, delivered at the worksite on stress, sleep, and work engagement, fo r a group of Scandinavian bank em- ployees. Methods: In a randomized, wait-list control lo ngitudinal design, employees from a large Scandinavian bank (n=57) were recruited for a standardized worksite low-dose Mindfulness-Based Intervention (MBI). Par- ticipants, randomized and stratified to group by gender, were 39% midd le-upper management employees, 41% support staff or consultant status. Mean age was 43 years with 31% males and 69% females. Changes in stress were evaluated pre/post intervention and 8 weeks post intervention via the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), sleep quality via the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and work engagement, using Utrecht Work Engagement Scale-9 (UWES-9). Results: A signific ant group x time effect was observ ed for PSS scores (p<0.001) as the treatment group decreased from 19.00 (sd = 5.46) to 14.07 (sd=4.92) after treatment while the control group showed virtually no change during th at time period. There was also a significant decrease (increase in sleep quality) in the PSQI (p=0.005) for the intervention gr oup only, as scores decrease d from 5.93 (sd=1.80) to 3.89 (sd=1.60) after treatment. In sleep quality sub scal es, significant shifts in th e treatment group were noted in the subjective sleep quality component (p=0.007) an d daytime dysfunction (p=0.0 04). At 2 months after the intervention ended, no additional significant change s in the PSS, PSQI or the PSQI components were ob- served, but nor did scores return to pre treatment valu es for the intervention grou p. Conclusion: A low-dose standardized MBI translated into Danish was effect ive in helping Scandinavian bank employees manage stress, have better quality of sleep, and be more awake and functional during work hours. This standardized MBI was effective beyond its cultural/languag e origin in addressing workplace stress. Moody K, Kramer D, Santizo RO, Magro L, Wyshogrod D, Ambrosio J, et al. Helping the helpers: Mindfulness training for burnout in pediatric oncology-a pilot program. Background. Burnout, a syndrome of em otional exhaustion, depers onalization, and dimini shed feelings of ac- complishment, is common among pediat ric oncology staff. This study explores a mindfulness-based course (MBC) to decrease burnout in a mult idisciplinary group of pediatric onco logy staff members in the United States and Israel. Materials and methods. Forty-eight pa rticipants, mostly nurses, were randomized to either the MBC intervention or a control grou p. MBC participants received eight weekly sessions of mindfulness edu- 59 Journal of Pediatric Oncology Nursing. 2013;30(5):275-84. cation. The primary outcome studied was burnout. Secondary outcomes studied included depression and per- ceived stress. Results. Nearly 100% of the subjects ex hibited signs of burnout at baseline and MBC did not re- sult in any significant improvement in scores on burnou t, perceived stress or depr ession scales. Qualitative analysis of diaries kept by subjects revealed reduced st ress, improved inner peace, compassion and joy, better focus and self-awareness and less somatic symptoms in the intervention arm. Conclusi ons. Burnout is a major problem in pediatric oncology staff. Mindfulness practice s can be taught in the workplace and may be a useful component of a multidimension al strategy to reduce burnout in this population.

Mindfulness training and reductions in teacher stress and burnout: Results from two randomized, waitlist- control field trials. Journal of Educational Psychology. 2013;105(3):787-804. The effects of randomization to mindfulness training (MT) or to a waitlist-control condition on psychological and physiological indicators of teachers' occupational stress and burnout were examined in 2 field trials. The sample included 113 elementary and secondary school teachers (89% female) from Canada and the United States. Measures were collected at baseline, post-pro gram, and 3-month follow-up; teachers were randomly assigned to condition after baseline assessment. Results showed that 87 % of teachers completed the program and found it beneficial. Teachers ra ndomized to MT showed greater mind fulness, focused attention and work- ing memory capacity, and occupational self-compassion, as well as lower levels of occupational stress and burnout at post-program and follow-up, than did those in the control condition. No statistically significant dif- ferences due to MT were found for physiological measur es of stress. Mediational analyses showed that group differences in mindfulness and self-compassion at post-p rogram mediated reductions in stress and burnout as well as symptoms of anxiety and depression at follow-up . Implications for teaching and learning are discussed. Shapiro SL, Astin JA, Bishop SR, Cordova M. Mindfulness- Based Stress Reduction for Health Care Professionals: Results From a Randomized Trial. International Journal of The literature is replete with evidence that the stress in herent in health care negatively impacts health care professionals, leading to increased de pression, decreased job satisfaction, an d psychological distress. In an at- tempt to address this, the current study examined the effects of a short-term stress management program, mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), on health ca re professionals. Results from this prospective ran- domized controlled pilot study suggest that an 8-week MBSR intervention may be effective for reducing stress and increasing quality of life and self -compassion in health care professional s.

Examining ways that a mindfulness-based intervention reduces stress in public school teachers: A mixed-methods study. Mindfulness. 2015:No Pagination Specified. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) can reduce teache rs' stress. The purpose of this mixed-method study, conducted within the context of a randomized-control tr ial of an MBI for teachers, was to examine four poten- tial ways by which the MBI reduced teacher stress, includ ing by (1) increasing thei r efficacy for regulating emotion on the job; (2) improving their ways of coping with stress at work; (3) increasing their efficacy for for- giving colleagues and students at work following conflict , as well as the tendency to do so; and (4) increasing teachers' tendency to feel compassion for people genera lly, and for challenging stud ents in particular. Public school teachers (n = 59) were randomized to an MBI or a waitlist control condition. They completed surveys at pre/post/follow-up and interviews at post-program desi gned to assess their coping with work stressors and their appraisals of their most challenging students. Survey data showed that efficacy beliefs and the tendency to forgive changed from pre/post for teachers in the MBI, and partially mediated reductions in stress from baseline to 4-month follow-up. Interv iew results showed a trend for teachers in the MBI to report more adap- tive strategies for coping with job stress, and a tendency to evaluate challenging students in a more positive affective light. Implications for MBIs in te acher professional discussed. A, Dove DC. A web- based approach to managing stress and mood disorders in the workforce. J Occup Envi- ron Med. 2008;50(8):960-8. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based multimedia health promotion program for the work- place, designed to help reduce stress and to prevent depression, anxiety, and subs tance abuse. Methods: Using a randomized controlled trial design , 309 working adults were randomly assigned to the web-based condition or to a wait-list control condition. A ll participants were assessed on multiple self-reported outcomes at pretest and posttest. Results: Relative to controls, the web-based group redu ced their stress, increased their knowledge of depression and anxiety, developed more positive attitudes toward treatment, and adopted a more healthy approach to alcohol consumption. Conclusi ons: We found that a brief and easily adaptable web- based stress management program can simultaneously reduce worker stress and address stigmatized behav- ioral health problems by embedding this prevention material into a more positive stress management frame- work.

The impact of consultation skills training in shared decision making on doctor behavior, confidence and stress and burnout: A ran- domized controlled trial. Psy- cho-Oncology / 2014;23:148- 149 difficult to achieve. Our aim was to train doctors in clear, collaborative and ethical communication about in- formed consent, and evaluate the impact of training on the doctors' communication behavior and their levels of stress and satisfaction with traini ng and confidence in information prov ision. Method: Participants 21 oncologists from 10 Australian/New Oncologists were randomized to participate in a 1-day workshop or not. Patients were re- cruited before and after the training. Doctors submitte d 1-2 audiotaped consultations and completed outcome measures before and after training. Th e training consisted of a seven-hour interactive face-to-face workshop with a follow-up telephone call one month later. The training incorporated written and oral materials (2 hours), a video modeling ideal behavior (30 minutes), ro le-play practice (4 hours), and individualized feed- back on audio-taped consultations with actual patients (30 minutes). Results: Ninety-five consultation interac- tions were audiotaped. Doctors strongly endorsed the trai ning. Coding of all consultation transcripts, using the Decision Analysis System for Oncology , revealed that ANZ intervention doctors demonstrated a significant increase in collaborative co mmunication after training while those in the control declined in their use of col- laborative behaviors during the study period. (p = 0.03). There was no effe ct of training on other doctor com- munication behaviors. Trained doctors did not demonstr ate increased confidence in their information provi- sion or reduced stress and burnout. Conclusions: Targete d skills training about shared decision making can facilitate positive changes in oncologists' communicati on behaviors. Perhaps doctor s in the control group at- tempted to appear as skilled as possible at pre-training assessment, but relapsed into more usual behavior at post-training assessment as motivation to conform to socially desirable communicati on decreased. Confidence in providing clear and unbiased information did not improv e. This may have been due to a ceiling effect, with most participating doctors scoring well on these subscale s prior to randomization. Finally, it may not be sur- prising that targeting one factor (co mmunication efficacy) was not sufficient to reduce stress and burnout. Re- search implications: Our finding in th e control group suggest that measuring behavior at two time points is not sufficient, and rather an averaged baseline over several assessment points is required to overcome social desir- ability effects. Oncologists were able to take up colla borative communication skills but struggled with more subtle skills related to avoiding coercion and informat ion giving. Perhaps more attention should be directed towards these latter skills and would be better practice d within more challenging sc enarios. Clinical implica- tions: Finding a balance between practi cality and efficacy is always a challe nge, and many clinicians struggle to 63 find time to attend longer workshops. Nevertheless, achievement of extensive change may require a longer commitment. Shorter, but more frequent sessions (short workshops once a month, or weekly 1-hour webinars) may be an effective but feasible way of delivering traini ng. Alternately, increasing the saliency of training by targeting specific challenging scenarios may im prove efficacy beyond generic SDM workshops.

Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine. 2013;55(10):1186-90. Objectives: It is unknown whether workplace interventions successfully improving health outcomes can also provide concurrent improvements in presenteeism and absenteeism. Methods: A 1-year cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted on 144 employees at a care unit in Denmark. The inte rvention consisted of calo- rie-limited diet, physical exercise, an d cognitive behavioral training during working hours 1 hour per week. The reference group was offered presentations about healthy lifestyle. Absenteeism and presenteeism (produc- tivity, workability, and sickness absence) were recorded at baseline and after 3 and 12 months of intervention. Results: In intention-to-treat analysis, a significant effect of the interventi on was found for productivity after 3 months. Nevertheless, after 12 months no significant effects on absenteeis m or presenteeism were found. Con- clusions: This study suggests that a worksite interventi on, despite successfully reducing overweight, does not induce lasting improvements on absenteeism or presenteeism. Deitz D, Cook RF, Hersch RK, Leaf S. Heart healthy online: an innovative approach to risk reduction in the workplace. J Occup Environ Med. 2014;56(5):547-53. Objectives: To examine whether a Web-based cardiovasc ular health promotion prog ram was associated with changes in self-reported behaviors, attitudes, and biometric indicators in a population of working adults. Methods: Employees (n = 210) were recruited and random ized into either an Internet-based or control condi- tion. Participants completed pre- and post-interventio n self-report assessments on diet, exercise, smoking, and mental health. Pre- and post-intervention biometri c screenings were also ob tained on blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and hip/waist circum ference. Results: The intervention was associated with significant im- provements in dietary attitudes (P = 0.003; F = 8.83), dietary intentions (P = 0.031; F = 4.72), dietary self- efficacy (P = 0.015; F = 5.97), exercise self-efficacy (P = 0.002; F = 9.51), exercise ha bits (P = 0.016; F = 5.94), and coping with stress (P = 0.003; F = 8.85) and depressi on (P = 0.036; F = 4.46). Conclusions: The program showed promise for promoting cardiovascular risk reduct ion behaviors. These results are consistent with simi- lar Web-based interventions. 64 Eriksen HR, Ihlebaek C, Mikkelsen A, Gronningsaeter H, Sandal GM, Ursin H. Improving subjective health at the worksite: A randomized controlled trial of stress management training, physical exercise and an integrated health programme. Occupational Medicine. 2002;52(7):383-91. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of 12 weeks of stress management training (SMT), physical exercise (PE) and an integrated health programme (IHP) in a work site setting on subjective health complaints. To do this, we randomly split 860 employees into the following groups: control (n = 344), PE (n = 189), IHP (com- prising physical exercise and health information) (n = 165) and SMT (n = 162). Ther e were no significant ef- fects on subjective health complaints, sick leave or jo b stress. However, strong and specific positive effects were experienced for the particular goal areas defined for each intervention. The PE group showed improved general health, physical fitness and muscle pain, while the SMT group showed improved stress management. The IHP group showed the strongest effects, affecting most goals set for treatment. Fujimori M & Uchitomi Y. Ef- fect of communication skills training program for oncolo- gists on their burnout and psychiatric disorder. Psycho- oncology 2015;24:281 Background/purpose: A communication skills training (CST) program for oncologists has been developed and shown to be effective for both their communication pe rformance during simulated consultation, their confi- dence in communicating with patients and patients' psyc hological distress. The aim of this study was to iden- tify the effects of the CST program on oncologists' burnout and psychologica l distress. Methods: Thirty oncolo- gists were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (IG; 2-day CST workshop) or control group (CG). Participants were assessed regardin g their burnout using the Maslach Bu rnout Inventory (MBI) and their psy- chological distress using the Gene ral Health Questionnaire 12-item ve rsion (GHQ-12) at baseline and 3 months after CST as a follow-up. The MBI consists of 22 items grouped into three factors: emotional exhaus- tion (EE, 9 items), depersonalizatio n (DP, 5 items) and personal accomp any (PA, 8 items). The GHQ-12 con- sists of 12 items. Time change in the baseline and follow-up surveys of the fact ors related to MBI and the GHQ-12 were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with controlled ba seline data. Results: At follow-up, the mean scores (+/-SD) of the EE, DP and PA factors of MBI and the GHQ-12 were 20 +/-14, 4+/- 4, 29+/- 9, 2 +/-3 IG 4 +/-4, 27 +/-12, 1 +/-2 in CG, respectively. The prevalence of them was 10-40%. There were not significant differences between groups by one-way ANOVA in the mean difference 65 scores (+/-SD) of the factors of MBI (EE: up, low scor es of EE, DP, and GHQ-12 we re associated with older and low scores of them at baseline, and high score of PA was associated with high er confidence in communica- tion skills, high score of it at baseline and female. Co nclusions: A CST program for oncologists is not shown to be effective in decreasing the level of burnout and psychological distress at 3 months after CST. Research Im- plications: Future study needs to explore the communic ation related factors associated with burnout and psy- chiatric disorder of oncologists. Prac tice Implications: There is a need for showing that a CST is not effective in decreasing the level of burnout and psychological distress at 3 months after CST to oncologists who participate F. Effect of zinc supplement on job stress of ICU nurses. (Per- sian) Journal of Babol Univer- sity of Medical Sciences 2013;15(1):38-45. Background and objective: Nursing is one of the stressful jobs and its empl oyees have high ranking in visit the doctor because of psychological prob lems. On the other hand stress caus es reduced level of serum zinc and complications related to its deficiency. So the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of zinc supplement on ICU nurses under job stress in educational hospital, Sari-Iran in 2011. Methods: In this double-blind random- ized clinical trial (RCT), 90 female ICU nurses who completed Osip ow job stress questionnaire and had job stress and had been qualified for study entry, randomly allocated in two equal intervention and control groups. At the beginning of the study, five milliliter blood wa s sampled from antecubital vein for measuring of serum Zinc. Intervention group received one capsule zinc sulfate 220 mg per 72 hours for four weeks and control group received one capsule placebo in the same way. Again at the end of the 4<sup>th</sup> week, job stress and serum Zinc level was measured in both groups and compared. Findings: In intervention group serum zinc level at the end of the study (88.25+1 3.2 mcg/dl) was significantly increased in comparison to before the study (56.63+15.8 mcg/dl) (p<0.05) . But in control group the difference betw een serum zinc level before (54.72+15.1 mcg/dl) and after the study (59.35+14.7 mcg/dl) was not si gnificant. There was no si gnificant change in over- all value of job stress before (208.39+31) and after the intervention (206.65+29) in both study groups. In in- tervention group, in three dimensions of job stress (role overload, role ambiguity and responsibility) signifi- cant reduction was seen (p<0.05) but in control group there was no significant change in any dimensions of 66 job stress. Conclusion: Considering to th e finding of the present study, to re duce some dimensions of job stress in ICU nurses, zinc supplement usage seems logical. Jacquet A, Grolleau A, Jove of 1) on professional fatigue tal and Clinical Pharmacology. 2014;28:24. Background: The professional fatigue or burnout syndrome is the result of severe professional stress, and car- ries a considerable societal burden. To date, treatments have shown little evidence of efficacy. We tested a die- tary supplement combining products purported to have effects. Methods: Double- blind randomized placebo-co a dietary su pplement including caso zepine, a melon ex- tract, taurine, and Eleutherococcus senticosus (Target-1), given daily for 12 weeks. Main outcome was differ- ence of change between treatment groups in the 7-poin t BMS-10 burnout scale. Secondary outcomes included the MBI-HSS burnout scale, Beck Depression inventory, an d visual analogue scales for professional and family quality of life, quality of sleep and perceived energy. Re sults: After 12 weeks of treatment or placebo, the BMS- 10 went from a mean of 5.0 (SD 0.5) to 2.7 (SD 0.9) in the active group (n = 44) vs. 4.9 (0.5) to 4.3 (0.8) in the placebo group (n = 43). Treatment effe ct size was 1.7 points (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.3-2.1), P < 0.001. Relative improvement was 34.2% (95% CI 26.9-41.5), P < 0.001. Initially 86% of active group patients were classified as severe/very severe burnout compared to 4% at 12 weeks. In the placebo group these figures were 78% and 44%, respectively (P < 0.0001 vs. active). Se condary outcomes showed similar results. Conclusion: This dietary supplement was associated with significant improvement of the symptoms of professional stress or burnout, after 12 weeks' tr eatment, compared to placebo.

A Cluster Randomized Trial of Interventions to Improve Work Conditions and Clinician Burnout in Primary Care: Results from the Healthy Work Place (HWP) Background: Work conditions in primar y care are associated with physician burnout and lower quality of care. Objective: We aimed to assess if im provements in work conditions impr ove clinician stress and burnout. Sub- jects: Primary care clinicians at 34 clinics in the upper Midwest and New Yo rk City participated in the study. Study design: This was a cluster randomized controlled trial. Measures: Work conditions, such as time pres- sure, workplace chaos, and work control, as well as clin ician outcomes, were measured at baseline and at 12-18 months. A brief work life and work conditions summary measure was provided to staf f and clinicians at inter- vention sites. Interventions: Diverse interventions were grouped into three categories: 1) improved communi- 67 Study. Journal of General Internal Medicine. 2015;30(8):1105-11. cation; 2) changes in workflow, and 3) targeted quality improvement (QI) projects. Analysis: Multilevel regres- sions assessed impact of work life data and interven tions on clinician outcomes. A multilevel analysis then looked at clinicians whose outcome scores improved an d determined types of interventions associated with improvement. Results: Of 166 clinicians, 135 (81.3 %) completed the study. While there was no group treat- ment effect of baseline data on cl inician outcomes, more intervention clinicians showed improvements in burnout (21.8 % vs 7.1 % less burned ou t, p = 0.01) and satisfaction (23.1 % vs 10.0 % more satisfied, p = 0.04). Burnout was more likely to improve with workflow inte rventions (Odds Ratio (OR) of improvement in burnout 5.9, p = 0.02), and with targeted QI projects than in controls (OR 4.8, p = 0.02). Interventions in communica- tion or workflow led to greater improvements in clinic ian satisfaction (OR 3.1, p = 0.04), and showed a trend toward greater improvement in intentio n to leave (OR 4.2, p = 0.06). Limitations: We used heterogeneous in- tervention types, and were uncertain how well interven tions were instituted. Conc lusions: Organizations may be able to improve burnout, dissatisfaction and rete ntion by addressing communication and workflow, and initiating I. Does aroma- therapy massage reduce job- related stress? Results from a randomised, controlled trial. International Journal of Aro- matherapy 2006;16(2):89-94. The aim of this study was to test whether aromatherapy massage has a positive effect on job-related stress. The study was a randomised controlled trial. Eighteen nurs es from two psychiatric hospitals were given six aroma- therapy massage treatment sessions on a once-a-week basis. Fourteen nurses from the same hospitals formed a control group. The effect of the treatment was measured by Cooper's Job Stress Questionnaire. There was a significant decrease in reported stress in the experime nt group. The result may have implications for job-re- lated stress in the workforce and be of significant economic value. 68 Kurebayashi LFS, Gnatta JR, Borges TP, da Silva MJP. Applicability of auriculotherapy in reducing stress and as a coping strategy in nursing professionals. Revista Latino-Americana de Enfermagem. 2012;20(5):980-7. Aims: randomized clinical tria l aimed at evaluating the auriculotherapy in reducing stress levels in 75 nursing professionals and analyze the coping domains that ha ve changed after treatment. Methodology: volunteers were divided into 3 groups (Control, Needles and Seeds) and received eight sessions at Shenmen, Kidney and Brainstem points. The Control Group didn't receive any intervention. Results: ANOVA test showed statistical differences in stress levels for Needle/Control Groups in the third and fourth assessments, according to Stress Symptoms List when compared the three groups in fo ur assessments. For the Inve ntory of Folkman/Lazarus, a significant difference was obtained for Spacing domain between needle/con trol. In analysis within the same group, differences were found for Confrontation in four th assessment between Need le/Control Groups and for Social Support in the third one between Seeds/Contro l Groups. Conclusion: The auriculotherapy decreased stress levels, changed Coping domains after treatment, suggesting that both Auricu lotherapy with needles and seeds can produce positive impact to improve strategy Coping in the nursing team. However, more studies are needed to conceive the ex tent of the technique. Lai HL, Li YM. The effect of music on biochemical markers and self-perceived stress among first-line nurses: a randomized controlled crossover trial. Journal of advanced nursing. 2011;67(11):2414-24. Aim: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of music on stress indices and to examine the association between music preference and stress. Background: Although clinical studies have demonstrated the effective- ness of music on stress, study results have been incons istent. At the time of writing, no known publications had investigated the effects of preferred music on work ers in high-stress professions such as nursing. Meth- ods: Using a randomized crossover controlled trial, 54 nurses were randomly assign ed to a music/chair rest sequence or chair rest/music sequence during the period February to June 2006. Each intervention lasted for 30 minutes. Participants in the musi c condition listened to self-selected soothing music using headphones for 30 minutes. In the chair rest conditio n, participants sat quietly for 30 minu tes. Serial measurements of partici- pants' heart rate, mean arterial pressure, finger temper ature and cortisol levels were taken with a BP monitor and chemillumincent immunoassay every 15 minutes throughout the procedure. Findings: Compared with chair rest, participants had a lower perceived stress level, cortisol, heart rate, mean arterial pressure and higher finger temperature while listening to music (P < 0\u00b705). Significant differences were also found between the two conditions in terms of post-test heart rate, cort isol levels, finger temperature and mean arterial pres- sure (P < 0\u00b705). Music preference sc ores ranged between 7 and 10, with a mean score of 8\u00b781 (sd = 1\u00b705), and 69 was significantly associated with mean arterial pressure , cortisol levels, self-perceived stress and finger tem- perature. Conclusion: The findings provided evidence for nurses to use soothing music as a research-based nursing intervention for stress reduction. Mehrabi T, Gorji S, Zolfaghari B, Razmjoo R. The effect of Rosmarinus herbal tea on occupational burnout in Iran Chemical Industry Investment company employees. Iranian Journal of Nursing and Midwifery Research. 2015;20(4):460-4. Background: Burnout is one of the most important proble ms that the employees encounter. Many health prob- lems arise due to burnout which is to be dealt with by the employees and the owners in the industry. Among many different ways of dealing with this problem, he rbal therapy seems to be a promising solution. The pre- sent study intended to investigate th e effect of Rosmarinus officinalis (R O) on burnout in employees who work in industrial environments. Materials and methods: An experimental study was performed to see whether RO has an effect on burnout or not. A to tal of 66 employees, aged between 20 and 60 years, who had worked for at least 1 year in the technical wards of Iran Chemical Indu stry Investment Company took part in the study. The participants were randomly assigned to two groups of control (n = 33) and RO (n = 33). The RO group re- ceived 4 g of Rosemary in 150 cc water per day for 2 mo nths. The control group, on the other hand, did not re- ceive anything. The data were collected via Geldard (1989) Burnout Inventory before and after the treatment. A t-test was performed to analyze the collected data. Resu lts: The results of statisti cal tests showed that after intervention, the score of occupation al burnout in RO group was better, and a significant difference was found between the control and experimental groups (P = 0.03), in favor of the experimental group. Conclusions: The results of the study revealed that Rosm arinus had a positive effect on burn out in employees in this study. Fur- ther studies in this field are suggested. Plodek JL. The effects of daily Usui Ryoho Reiki self- treatment on the perceived stress of staff nurses: Saybrook Graduate School and Research Center; 2011. Stress and stress-related diseases have reached epidemic proportions in contemporary society, yet there is lit- tle research on how self-care methods might be used to reduce the work-related stress of nurses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of usin g daily Usui Ryoho Reiki self -treatments as self-care to reduce perceived stress among nurses. The research was guided by two hypotheses: (a) daily use of Usui Ryoho Reiki would reduce cortisol levels, an d (b) daily use of Usui Ryoho Reiki would reduce the perceived level of stress. This study used a mixed-method approach consisti ng of an experimental group (n = 11) and a wait=list control group (n = 11) for a total of 22 subjects. The mixed-method design included a randomized control trial, 70 and utilized the Perceived Stress Scale, salivary cortisol samples, and daily practice logs, along with qualitative focus group interviews, with nurses using Usui Ryoho Re iki as self-care and with a control group. The sample size was smaller than planned and extraneous variables made continued participation in the study difficult. As a result, the findings of this study are inconclusive. The quantitative find ings did not support the hypotheses; however, the qualitative focus groups findings evidenced a decrease in perceived stress, an increase in relaxa- tion, and a decrease in physical symptoms such as palpit ations. The marginal trending revealed in the results of the Perceived Stress Scale and cortisol testing, alon g with the focus group data, supports the need for fur- ther research. Research using a larger group sample over an extended period of time has the potential to deter- mine whether Usui Ryoho Reiki for self-treatment is an effective self-care intervention, reducing stress among nurses. Rosada RM, Rubik B, Mainguy B, Plummer J, Mehl- Madrona L. Reiki reduces burnout among community mental health clinicians. Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine. 2015;21(8):489-95. Background: Clinicians working in commu nity mental health clinics are at high risk for burnout. Burnout is a problem involving emotional exhaustion , depersonalization, and reduced pe rsonal accomplishment. Reiki is a holistic biofield energy therapy beneficial for reducing stress. The purpose of this st udy was to determine if 30 minutes of healing touch could reduce burnout in commun ity mental health clinicians . Methods: We utilized a crossover design to explore the efficacy of Reiki versus sham Reiki, a pseudo treatment designed to mimic true Reiki, as a means to reduce symptoms of burnout. Su bjects were randomized to whether they started with Reiki or sham. The Maslach Burnou t Inventory-Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS) and the Measure Your Medical Outcome Profile Version 2 (MYMOP-2) were used as outcome measures. Multilevel modeling was used to represent the relations among variables. Results: Reiki was statisti cally significantly better than sham Reiki in reducing burnout among commu nity mental health clinicians (p=0 .011). Reiki was significant in re- ducing depersonalization (p<0.001), but only among single people. Reiki reduced the primary symptom on the MYMOP also only among single people (p=0.03). Conclu sions: The effects of Reiki were differentiated from sham Reiki. Reiki could be helpful in community mental health settings for the mental health of the practition- ers. 71 Saeedi M, Malekhosseini A, Hekmatpou D, Ghafarzadegan R, Hajiaghaee R. The effect of Ginkgo on stress level of nurses. (Persian). Journal of Medicinal Plants. 2014;13(50):64-72. Background: Mental Health of Nurses in recent decades, attracted more at tention. Therefore strategies to re- duce stress level is essential. Objective: Ginkgo biloba is one of thes herbs that has widely usage in complimen- tary medicine.With regard to the these points and consid er of positive effects of Ginkgo biloba, this study aimed to assess the effect of Ginkgo biloba on nurses stress levels. Methods: This clinical trial was a double blined cross sectional study that nurses eligible to pa rticipate in the study using sampling methods were se- lected and Then randomly given drug or placebo to nurses. The medicati on and placebo was 40 mg, twice a day. After the two -week, the experimental and control gr oup were switched. Result: In this study 62 nurses for two weeks consume ginkgo. Sum score of occupational stress questionnaire in case group after intervention was 40.15 with standard deviation 10.26. sum score of oc cupational stress questionna ire in control group after intervention was 34.55 with standard deviation 12. Conclu sion: With regard that stre ss in nurses has problems such as decrease quality of care and unsatisfaction an d unefficacy and fatigue and these factors lead to emo- tional disorder then intervention for control them is necessary. Therefore with regard that this research iden- tify positive effect of ginkgo on stress levels and gink go is a part of complimentary therapy has a wildly appli- cation then we can use that for in crease quality of life in nurses. Varney E, Buckle J. Effect of inhaled essential oils on mental exhaustion and moderate burnout: A small pilot study. Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine. 2013;19(1):69-71. Objectives: The objective of this pilot study was to determine the effectiveness of a mixture of essential oils (peppermint, basil, and helichrysum) on mental exhaustion, or moderate burnout (ME/MB) using a personal inhaler. Design: This was a randomized , controlled, double-blind pilot study. Data were collected 3 times a day for 3 weeks (Monday-Friday). The first week was baseline for both groups, the second week was intervention (aromatherapy or placebo), and the third week was washou t. Settings/location: Part icipants used a personal inhaler at home or at work. Subjects: The subjects comprised a convenience sample of 13 women and 1 man who each had self-assessed ME /MB. Interventions: Participants were ra ndomized to receive a personal inhaler containing either a mixture of essent ial oils or rose water (as used in Indian cooking). Outcome measures: The outcome measures were a 0-10 scale with 10=worst feel ing of burnout, 0=no feelin g of burnout. There was a qualitative questionnaire rating aroma and a questionna ire listing perceived stresso rs. Results: While both 72 groups had a reduction in perception of ME/MB, the aromatherapy group had a much greater reduction. Con- clusions: The results suggest that inhaling essential oils may reduce the percei ved level of mental fa- tigue/burnout. Further research J, Valenzuela M. Putting brain training to the test in the workplace: a randomized, blinded, multisite, is effective at improving cognitive outc omes in children with and without clinical impairment as well as older individuals. Yet whether CT is of any preventative health benefit to work- ing age adults is controversial. Our objective was therefore to investigate the real-world efficacy of CT in the workplace, involving employees from across the working-age spectrum and addressing many of the design is- sues that have limited trials to date. Methods and fi ndings: 135 white collar employees of a large Australian public sector organization were randomised to either 16 weeks (20 minutes three times per week) of online CT or an active control (AC) program of equal length an d structure. Cognitive, wellbeing and productivity out- come measures were analysed across three timepoints: baseline, immediately after training and 6 months post-training. CT effects on cognitive outcomes were limited, even after planned subgroup analyses of cogni- tive capacity and age. Unexpectedly, we found that our AC condition, which comprised viewing short docu- mentaries about the natural world, had more impact. Compared to the CT group, 6 months after the end of training, those in the AC group experienced a significant increase in their self-reported Quality of Life (Effect Size g = .34 vs -.15; TIMExGROUP p = .003), decrease in stress levels (g = .22 vs -.19; TIME x GROUP p = .03), and overall improvement in Psychological Wellbe ing (g = .32 vs -.06; TIMExGROUP p = .02). Conclu- sions: CT does not appear to positively impact cogn ition or wellbeing amongst white collar office workers; however, short time-out respite activities may have va lue in the promotion of psyc hological wellbeing. Given looming challenges to workplace productivity, further work-based interventional research targeting employee mental health is recommended. 73 Cheng C, Kogan A, Hin-man C. The effectiveness of a new, coping flexibility intervention as compared with a cognitive- behavioural intervention in managing work stress. Work & Stress 2012;26(3):272-289. In typical stress management programmes, working adults acquire various coping skills for managing work stress. In addition to building coping skills, we propose the in clusion of a \"meta skill\" of coping flexibility, which helps individuals to recognize the distinctions among the coping requirements of diverse stressful events and to facilitate employment of appropriate skills for handling the specific demands of those events. Our study tested this proposal by comparing the efficacy of a new coping flexibility in tervention with that of a commonly adopted cognitive-behavioura l intervention in reducing depre ssion. We randomly assigned 161 healthy Chinese working adults (55 men, 106 women, Mage = 32 years) to (1) attend a coping flexibility inter- vention for acquiring both coping skills and coping flex ibility, (2) attend a cognit ive-behavioural intervention for acquiring coping skills only, or (3) a waiting list to receive an intervention after the study had been com- pleted. Participants were followed up four months later. Those who had attended the coping flexibility inter- vention reported the largest increase in levels of coping flexibility, and such an increase corresponded to a re- duction in depression immediately and four months afte r the intervention. These results indicate the value of teaching individuals to adapt their coping strategies to specific requirements of stressful situations. Eisen KP, Allen GJ, Bollash M, Pescatello LS. Stress manage- in the workplace: A com- parison of a computer-based and an in-person stress-man- agement intervention. Com- puters in Human Behavior. 2008;24(2):486-496. Work stress contributes significantly to corporate health costs. Outcomes from a stress-management interven- tion provided via an instructor led versus a computer -presented format were comp ared through a randomized, controlled design. Brief relaxation procedures presented in both formats led to highly significant reductions in immediately-reported stress . Stress reduction, however, was not asso ciated with improvement in longer-term indices of workplace stress following completion of th e intervention and at a one-month follow-up. Attrition was significantly higher in the comp uter-presentation format . Across both presentation formats, however, more frequent use of stress-reduction techniques was correlated significantl y with greater reductions in stress indices (e.g., nervousness, social isolat ion, overall work stress) at follow-up. Lloyd J, Bond FW, Flaxman PE. The value of psychological flexibility: Examining psychological mechanisms Little is known of the mechanisms by which interventi ons for burnout work. Employ ees of a UK government department were randomly assigned to either a worksi te group-based CBT intervention called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT; n = 43 ), which aimed to increase participants ' psychological flexibility, or a wait- ing list control group (n = 57). The ACT group received th ree half-day sessions of training spread over two and 74 underpinning a cognitive behavioural therapy intervention for burnout. Work & Stress. 2013;27(2):181-99. a half months. Data were collected at baseline (T1), at the beginning of the second (T2) and third (T3) work- shops, and at six months' follow up (T4). Consistent with ACT theory, analyses revealed that, in comparison to the control group, a significant increa se in psychological flexib ility from T2 to T3 in the ACT group mediated the subsequent T2 to T4 decrease in emotional exhaustion in that group. Consistent with a theory of emotional burnout development, this significant decrease in emotional exhaustion from T2 to T4 in the ACT group ap- peared to prevent the significant T3 to T4 increase in depersonalization seen in the control group. Strain also decreased from T2 to T3 in the ACT group only, but no mediator of that improvement was identified. Implica- tions for theory and practice in the fields of ACT and emotional burnout are discussed. Mazaheri MA, Darani FM, Eslami AA. Effect of a brief stress management intervention on work-related stress in employees of Isfahan steel company, Iran. Journal of Research in Medical Sciences. 2012;17(1 SPL.1):S87-S92. Background: Work-related stress has increased during recent years throughout the world. Studies demon- strate that Work-related stress can have a negative effect on the quality of life, productivity, and as a result lead to considerable socioeconomic consequences. The pu rpose of the current study was to examine the effects of a brief stress management interven tion on work-related stress in em ployees of Isfahan Steel Company in Iran. Methods: A quasi-experimental design was used to compare the intervention group with the control group. Eighty-eight employees of Blas t Furnaces were randomly allocated to intervention (n = 44) and control groups (n = 44) and completed Occupa tional Role Questionnaire before and after A brief three-session CB (Cognitive behavioral) stress manageme nt. Results: After the intervention significant differences were de- tected between the control and intervention groups in ro le overloud, role insufficiency, role boundary, and re- sponsibility but not in role ambigu ity and physical environment. Conclusi ons: Results suggest that the brief stress management intervention can be considered as a preliminary education for employees to develop skills to cope with role overloud, role insufficiency, role bo undary, and responsibility, which are some of the factors of work-related stress. Weingardt KR, Cucciare MA, Bellotti C, Lai WP. A randomized trial comparing two models of web-based This study compared training outcomes obtained by 14 7 substance abuse counselors who completed eight self- paced online modules on cognitive-behavioral therapy (C BT) and attended a series of four weekly group super- vision sessions using Web conferencing software. Particip ants were randomly assigned to two conditions that 75 training in cognitive- behavioral therapy for substance abuse counselors. Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment. 2009;37(3):219- 27. systematically varied the degree to wh ich they explicitly promoted adherence to the CBT protocol and the de- gree of control that they afforded participants over th e sequence and relative emphas is of the training curricu- lum. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and immediat ely following training. Counse lors in both conditions demonstrated similar improvements in CBT knowledge an d self-efficacy. Counselors in the low-fidelity condi- tion demonstrated greater improvemen t on one of three measures of job- related burnout when compared to the high-fidelity condition. The study concludes that it is feasible to im plement a technology-based training intervention with a geographically diverse sample of pr actitioners, that two traini ng conditions applied to these samples of real-world counselors do not produce statistically or cl inically significant differences in knowledge or self-efficacy, and that further research is needed to evaluate how a fl exible training model may influence clinician effects of a randomized controlled worksite relaxation intervention in Greece. Ann Agric Environ Med. 2014;21(2):382-7. The study aimed to evaluate the short-term benefits of simple relaxation techniques in white-collar em- ployees. The study was a two-arm parallel group rand omized controlled trial. 152 employees were ran- domly assigned to receive the 8-week programme (N =80) (relaxation breathin g and progressive muscle relaxation, twice a day) or not (wait-list group N=72). Self-reported validated measures were used to eval- uate perceived stress, health locus of control, job and lifestyle related variables. Saliva cortisol were also sampled and measured. Adjusted mean changes on outcomes were estimated by linear mixed model anal- ysis. 127 employees were finally analyzed (68 in the intervention and 59 in the control group). Specific stress-related symptoms, psychologica l job demands and cortisol levels we re found to be significantly de- creased after 8-weeks in the intervention group. The result was probably affected by the general socio-eco- nomic condition during the study period. Cortisol levels were also significantly related with age, family 76 situation, gender and sampling time . Simple relaxation training (dia phragmatic breathing and progressive muscle relaxation) could benefit empl oyees and it is strongly proposed that these and other similar tech- niques should be tested in various labour settings. Elder C, Nidich S, Moriarty F, Nidich R. Effect of Transcendental Meditation on Employee Stress, Depression, and Burnout: A Ran- domized Controlled Study. Perm J. 2014;18(1):19-23. Objective: To evaluate the effects of the Transcendental Meditation program on psychological distress and burnout among staff at a residential therapeutic school for students with severe behavioral problems. De- sign: A total of 40 secondary schoolteachers and suppo rt staff at the Bennington School in Vermont, a therapeutic school for children with behavioral problems, were randomly assigned to either practice of the Transcendental Meditation program or a wait-list co ntrol group. The Transcendental Meditation course was provided by certified instructor s. Main outcome measures: Outcome measures were assessed at base- line and four months, and included perceived stress, depression, and burnout. A multivariate analysis of covariance was used to determine overall effects. Resu lts: Analysis of the 4-month intervention data indi- cated a significant improvement in the main outcomes of the study resulting from practice of the Tran- scendental Meditation program compared with contro ls (Wilks LAMBDA = 0.695; p = 0.019). Re- sults of univariate F tests indicated a significant re duction of all main outcome measures: perceived stress (F(1,32) = 13.42; p = < 0.001); de pression (F(1,32) = 6.92; p = 0.01 3); and overall teacher burnout (F(1,32) = 6.18; p = 0.018). Effect si zes ranged 0.40 to 0.94. Conc lusions: The Transcendental Medi- tation program was effective in reducing psychologica l distress in teachers and support staff working in a therapeutic school for students with behavioral prob lems. These findings have important implications for employees' job performanc e as well as their mental and physical health. Hartfiel N, Burton C, Rycroft- Malone J, Clarke G, Havenhand J, Khalsa SB, et al. Yoga for reducing perceived stress and back pain at work. Occupational Medicine 2012;62:606-612. Aims: To determine the effectiveness of a yoga-based intervention for reducing perceived stress and back pain at work. Methods: Participants were recruite d from a British local gove rnment authority and ran- domized into a yoga group who received one 50 min Dr u Yoga session each week for 8 weeks and a 20 min DVD for home practice and a control group who rece ived no intervention. Baseline and end-programme measurements of self-reported stress, back pain and psychological well-being were assessed with the Per- ceived Stress Scale, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire and the Posi tive and Negative Affect Scale. 77 Results: There were 37 participants in each group. Analysis of variance and multiple linear regression showed that in comparison to the control group, the yoga group report ed significant reductions in per- ceived stress and back pain, and a substantial improvement in psychological well-being. When compared with the control group at the end of the programme, the yoga group scores were significantly lower for perceived stress, back pain, sadness and hostility, an d substantially higher for feeling self-assured, atten- tive and serene. Conclusions: The results indicate that a workplace yoga interven tion can reduce perceived stress and back pain and improve psychological well-being. Larger randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the broader efficacy of yoga fo r improving workplace productivity and reducing sick- ness absence. Kaspereen, D. Relaxation inter- vention for stress reduction among teachers and staff. International Journal of Stress Management. 2012; 19(3):238-250. The present study examined how relaxation therapy (RT) can be effective in helping high school teachers and staff members reduce stress. Specifically, I examined the effectiveness of RT on overall perceived stress, perceived work stress, and life satisfaction. This quantitative, experimental study randomly as- signed 54 teachers and staff members from a selected high school to an interven tion relaxation group and a control group. RT was conducted once a week for 30-45 min per session for 4 consecutive weeks for the intervention group, and both groups were evaluated before and after the intervention. A mixed analysis of variance demonstrated that the intervention was effective. Overall stress and perceived work stress de- creased and life satisfaction scores increased for th e intervention group. No changes occurred on these three measures in the control group. Relaxation trai ning programs could be one method to improve em- ployee satisfaction. Oman D, Hedberg J, Thoresen CE. Passage meditation reduces perceived stress in health professionals: a randomized, controlled trial. Journal of The authors evaluated an 8-week, 2-hr per week trai ning for physicians, nurses, chaplains, and other health professionals using nonsecta rian, spiritually based self-managem ent tools based on passage medi- tation (E. Easwaran, 1978/1991). Participants were rand omized to intervention (n = 27) or waiting list (n = 31). Pretest, posttest, and 8- and 19-week follow-u p data were gathered on 8 measures, including per- ceived stress, burnout, mental health, and psycholo gical well-being. Aggregated across examinations, ben- eficial treatment effects were observed on stress (p = .0013) and mental health (p = .03). Treatment effects 78 consulting and clinical psychology. 2006;74(4):714-9. on stress were mediated by adherence to practices (p = .05). Stress reductions remained large at 19 weeks (84% of the pretest standard deviation, p = .006). Evidence suggests this program reduces stress and may enhance mental health. Sutarto AP, Wahab MN, Zin NM. Resonant breathing biofeedback training for stress reduction among manufacturing operators. Int J Occup Saf Ergon. 2012;18(4):549-61. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of resonant breathing biofeedback training for reducing stress among manufacturing operators. Resonant brea thing biofeedback works by teaching people to rec- ognize their involuntary heart rate variability and to control patterns of this physiological response. Thirty-six female operators from an electronic manufacturing factory were randomly assigned as the ex- perimental group (n = 19) and the control group (n = 17 ). The participants of th e intervention received 5 weekly sessions of biofeedback training. Physiological stress profiles and self-perceived depression, anxi- ety, and stress scale (DASS) were assessed at pre- and post-intervention. Results indicated that depres- sion, anxiety, and stress significan tly decreased after the training in the experimental group; they were supported by a significant increase in physiological measures. Overall, these results support the potential application of resonant biofeedback training to reduce negative em otional symptoms among industrial Tabell of cardiovascular and resistance exercise. PeerJ. 2015;2015(4). Objectives: The global burden of burn out cost is in excess of $300 billio n annually. Locally, just under half of working Australians experi ence high levels of occupational burn out. Consequently, burnout interventions are paramount to organisational productivity. Exercise has the potential to provide a multilevel and cost ef- fective burnout intervention. The curre nt study aims to extend the literature by comparing cardiovascular with resistance exercise to assess th eir relative effectiveness against well-being, perceived stress, and burn- out. Design: Participants were 49 (36 females and 13 males) previously inactive volunteers ranging in age 79 from 19 to 68 that completed a four week exercise pr ogram of either cardiovascular, resistance, or no exer- cise (control). Randomised control trial design was employed. Method. Participants were measured against the Subjective Exercise Experience Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale, and theMaslach Burnout Inventory. Results: After four weeks of exercise participants ha d greater positive well-being and personal accomplish- ment, and concomitantly less psychological distress, pe rceived stress, and emotional exhaustion. Cardiovas- cular exercise was found to increase well-being and decrease psychological distress, perceived stress, and emotional exhaustion. Resistance training was noticeab ly effective in increasing well-being and personal accomplishment and to reduce perceived stress. The pr esent findings revealed large effect sizes suggesting that exercise may be an effective treatment for burnout. However, given a small samp le size further research needs to be conducted. Conclusion: Exercise has potent ial to be an effective burnout intervention. Different types of exercise may assist employees in different wa ys. Organisations wishing to proactively reduce burn- out can do so by encouraging their employ ees to access regular exercise programs. Brox JI, Frooystein O. Health- related quality of life and sickness absence in community nursing home employees: Randomized controlled trial of physical exercise. Occupational Medicine. 2005;55(7):558-63. Background: It is a common belief that physical exercise at the workplace decreases subjective health com- plaints and reduces sickness absence, but this is not supported by prev ious randomized studies. Aims: To evaluate the effectiveness of physical exercise at the workplace. Methods: One hundred and twenty-nine employees in a community-based nursing home for the elderly were randomized into physical exercise or control groups. A weekly exercise class consisting of light aerobic exercise, muscle strengthening and stretching was held for a 6-month period. The control group was told to continue their ordinary activity. The main outcome measures were aerobic fitness (UKK , walking test), health-related quality of life (COOP/WONCA) and sickness absence. Blinded assessment s were carried out at baseline and following the 6-month intervention. Complete sickness absence data were collected from a community register for two comparable 7-month periods. Results: The average numb er of exercise sessions was 12 (0-26). Self-reported physical activity increased in the intervention group compared with the control group (P < 0.01). Aerobic fitness improved in both groups (P < 0.01). Mean si ckness absence increased from 6.8 to 15.6 days in the exercise group and from 10.4 to 14.5 in the control group. No differences betw een groups were found for 80 aerobic fitness, health-related qualit y of life or sickness absence. Conc lusion: The intervention neither im- proved health-related quality of life nor reduced sickness absence. Gram B, Holtermann A, Bultmann U, Sjogaard G, Sogaard K. Does an exercise intervention improving aerobic capacity among construction workers also improve musculoskeletal pain , work ability, productivity, perceived physical exertion, and sick leave?: a randomized controlled trial. J Occup Environ Med. 2012;54(12):1520-6. Objective: To investigate whether an exercise intervention shown to increase aerobic capacity, would also lead to less musculoskeletal pain; improved work abil ity, productivity, and perc eived physical exertion; and less sick leave. Methods: Sixty-seven construction work ers were randomized into an exercise group training 3 x 20 minutes per week and a control group. Question naires and text messages were completed before and after the 12-week intervention. Results: No significan t changes were found in musculoskeletal pain, work ability, productivity, perceived physical exertion, and sick leave with the intervention. Questionnaires and text messages provided similar results of pain and work ability. Conclusions: Alth ough the intervention im- proved aerobic capacity, it was not successful in im proving musculoskeletal pain and other work-related factors. A detectable improvement presumably requires a more multifaceted intervention, larger sample size, or longer follow-up. Text messages may be a co nvenient data-collection me thod in future studies. Griffith JM, Hasley JP, Liu H, Sev- ern DG, Conner LH, Adler LE. Qigong stress reduction in hospital staff. J Altern Complement Med. 2008;14(8):939-45. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a qigong training program in reduc- ing stress in hospital staff. Methods: Subjects were ra ndomly assigned to a 6-week intervention of either qigong practice (n = 16) or a waiting list (n = 21). The primary measure of stre ss was the Perceived Stress Scale. Secondary measures included the Short Form 36 (SF-36) quality-of-life measure and a 100-mm ana- log pain scale. Results: The qigong group demonstrat ed a statistically significant reduction of perceived stress compared to the control group (p = 0.02). On th e Social Interaction subscale of the SF-36, the qigong group demonstrated greater improvement compared to controls (p = 0.04). Within-groups analyses demon- strated that the qigong group (p = 0.03), but not the control group, experienced a significant reduction of pain intensity. A regression analysis demonstrated an association between higher ba seline stress levels and greater improvement within the qigong group (R(2) = 0.34; p = 0.02). Conclusions: These results suggest that short-term exposure to qigong was effective in re ducing stress in hospital staff. Further studies are needed to evaluate the possible effectiveness of qigong in reducing pain and in improving quality of life. 81 Nurminen E, Malmivaara A, Ilmarinen J, Ylostalo P, Mutanen P, Ahonen G, et al. Effectiveness of a worksite exercise program with respect to perceived work ability and sick leaves among women with physical work. Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment & Health. 2002;28(2):85-93. Objectives: This multicente red randomized controlled trial evaluated the effect of worksite exercise inter- vention on perceived work ability an d sick leaves. Methods: Women (N = 260, mean age 40 years) engaged in physically demanding laundry work were individually randomized into an interv ention (N = 133) or con- trol (N = 127) group. Perceived work ability was assessed with questionnaires at 3, 8, 12, and 15 months. Sick leave information was obtained from the personnel administration. Follow-up attendance was 100% at 3 months but declined gradually to 90% by 15 months. Both the interventi on and control subjects received a 30-minute feedback on their physical capacity from a physiotherapist and individual exercise prescription and counseling. The intervention subjects also participat ed in worksite exercise training guided by a physio- therapist. Sixty-minute sessions (N = 26) were held once a week for 8 months. About 50% of the interven- tion group participated in at least two-thirds of th e sessions. Results: According to a dichotomized work ability index, at 12 months, workers with \"good\" or \"e xcellent\" work ability increa sed more in the interven- tion group than in the control group (11.0%, 95% CI 0. 2-21.9), as did the health-r elated prognosis of work ability at 8 months (8.1%, 95% CI 0. 5-16.3). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups as regards job satisfaction, work ability inde x (including series of ques tions on 7 items), or sick leaves. Conclusions: Physical activity once a week at worksites improves the perceived work ability of women with physically demanding work only slightly. Perceived work ability and sick leaves cannot be af- fected very positively using single-component exerci se intervention. Work abil ity promotion may need a more multiprofessional approach. Palumbo MV, Wu G, Shaner- McRae H, Rambur B, McIntosh B. Tai Chi for older nurses: a workplace wellness pilot study. Applied nursing research : ANR. 2012;25(1):54-9. Purpose: The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility of a Tai Chi workplace wellness pro- gram as a cost effective way of improving physical and mental health, reducing wo rk related stress, and im- proving work productivity among older nurses in a hosp ital setting Design A random ized control trial of two groups (control and Tai Chi group). Design: A randomized control trial of two groups (control and Tai Chi group). Settings: Northeastern academic medical center. Subjects: A convenience sample of eleven female nurses (mean age 54.4 years). Intervention: The Tai Chi group (n = 6) was asked to attend Tai Chi classes once a week offered at their worksite and to practice on their own for 10 minutes each day at least 4 days per 82 week for 15 weeks. Controls (n = 5) received no intervention. Measures: SF-36 Health Survey, Nursing Stress Scale (NSS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Sit-and-Reach test, Functional Reach test, the Work Limi- tations Questionnaire, workplace injury and unschedu led time off. Analysis: The two study groups were compared descriptively and changes across time in the intervention versus control were compared. Results: The Tai Chi group took no unscheduled time-off hours, whereas, the control group was absent 49 hours dur- ing the study period. There was also a 3% increase in work productivity and significant improvement in functional reach (p=0.03) compared to the control group. Other outcomes were not statistically significant. Conclusion: This pilot study demonstrat es the feasibility of Tai Chi with older female workers as a cost ef- fective wellness option in the workpl ace; thus encouraging replication with a larger sample. Methodological were also addressed. Tabell 12: RCTer sortert Rusby JC. The Value of Workshops on Psychological Flexibility for Early Childhood Special Education Staff. Topics Early Child Spec Educ. 2013;32(4). High stress and burnout are common for early childhood sp ecial educators, contributing to high rates of at- trition, diminished educational e ffectiveness, and high turnover. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a promising approach for the prevention and treatment of a wide variety of problems. Using a ran- domized wait-list control design, this pilot study ev aluated whether ACT workshops delivered to preschool teachers who serve children with developmental disa bilities would improve stress-related problems of teachers (i.e., stress, depression, and burnout) and increase collegial support. At pretest, measures of expe- riential avoidance (EA) and mindful awareness (MA) sh owed significant relationsh ips to reports of depres- sion, stress, and burnout. The intervention reduced st aff members' EA, increased teachers' MA and valued living (VL), and improved teachers' sense of efficacy. This suggests that ACT workshops can help influence factors affecting depression, stress, and burnout in an early childhood special education setting. 83 Bond FW & Bunce D. Mediators of Change in Emotion-Focused and Problem-Focused Worksite Stress Management Interventions. Jour- nal of Occupational Health Psy- chology 2000;5(1):156-163. Ninety volunteers in a media organization were ra ndomly allocated to an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT, n = 30) group that sought to enhance peop le's ability to cope with work-related strain, an Innovation Promotion Program (IPP, n = 30) that help ed individuals to identify and then innovatively change causes of occupational strain , or a waitlist control group (n = 30). Both interventions lasted 9 hr, spread over 3 months. Improvements in mental health and work-related variables were found following both interventions. As hypothesized, changes in outcom e variables in the ACT condition were mediated only by the acceptance of undesirable thoughts and feelings. In the IPP condition, outcome change was mediated only by attempts to modify stressors. Discussion focused on the importance of understanding the mecha- nisms underpinning change in occupation al stress management interventions. Brinkborg H, Michanek J, Hesser H, Berglund G. Acceptance and commitment therapy for the treat- ment of stress among social work- ers: a randomized controlled trial. Behav Res Ther. 2011;49(6- 7):389-98. Chronic stress increases the risk of health problems an d absenteeism, with negative consequences for indi- viduals, organizations and society. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of a brief stress management intervention based on the principles of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) on stress and general mental health for Swedish social workers (n = 106) in a randomized, controlled trial. Partici- pants were stratified according to stress level at base line in order to examine whether initial stress level moderated the effect of the intervention. Two thirds of the participants had high st ress levels at baseline (Perceived Stress Scale; score of >25). The results showed that the intervention significantly decreased lev- els of stress and burnout, and increased general mental he alth compared to a waiting list control. No statis- tically significant effects were, howeve r, found for those with low levels of stress at baseline. Among partici- pants with high stress, a substantial proportion (42%) reached criteria for clinically significant change. We concluded that the intervention succ essfully decreased stress and symptoms of burnout, and increased gen- eral mental health. Evidence is, thus , provided supporting ACT as brief, stress management intervention for social workers. Luoma JB, Vilardaga JP.

In this study, counselors taking a 2-day ACT workshop were ra ndomly assigned to either six 30-min phone consultation sessions (n = 10) or no additional co ntact (n = 10). The results show that those in the consultation condition reported higher psychological flexibility at the 3-month follow-up com- pared to the workshop-only condition. Improvements in ACT knowledge, overall bu rnout, and personal ac- complishment were found in both groups, independent of whether they received phone consultation, and this increase was maintained over time.

The impact of online resilience training for sales manag- ers on wellbeing and performance. E-Journal of Applied Psychology. 2009; 5(1):89-95. In a randomised controlled trial, the internet-based ResilienceOnline (ROL) program was evaluated among lubricant sales managers at BP Australia. This program is designed to enhance resilience by teach- ing seven skills to help improve ability to cope wi th challenges and setbacks and maximise potential achievements. Sales managers were allocated to complete the ROL program (n = 26) or to be in a waitlist- control condition (n = 27) and were compared on pre- and post-intervention measures of happiness, qual- ity of life, depression, anxiety, stress and work perf ormance. Sales managers foun d the resilience training very enjoyable and believed it would improve their work performance and life skills. However, a high pro- portion of sales managers did not co mplete the ROL program and it was not found to significantly reduce distress or improve quality of life or work performance. 85 Mealer M, Conrad D, Evans J, Jooste K, Solyntjes J, Rothbaum B, et al. Feasibility and acceptability of a resilience training program for intensive care unit nurses. Am J Crit Care. 2014;23(6):e97-105. Background: The critical nurs ing shortage is particularly apparent in specialty areas such as intensive care units (ICUs). Some nurses develop resilient coping stra tegies and adapt to stressful work experiences, mit- igating the development of common maladaptive psycho logical symptoms. Objectives: To determine if a multimodal resilience training program for ICU nurs es was feasible to perform and acceptable to the study participants. Methods: In a randomized and co ntrolled 12-week intervention study, treatment and control groups completed demographi c questions and measures of resili ence, anxiety, depression, post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), an d burnout syndrome before and afte r the intervention. The interven- tion included a 2-day educational workshop, written exposure sessions, event-triggered counseling ses- sions, mindfulness-based stress reduction exercises, an d a protocolized aerobic ex ercise regimen. Nurses in the intervention arm also completed satisfaction surveys for each component of the intervention. Re- sults: This mulitmodal resilience training program wa s feasible to conduct and acceptable to ICU nurses. Both nurses randomized to the treatment group and nurses randomized to the control group showed a significant decrease in PTSD sympto m score after the intervention. Conclusions: A multifaceted resilience training program for ICU nurses was both feasible and acceptable. A sufficiently powered, randomized clinical trial is needed to assess the effect of the inte rvention on improving indivi duals' level of resilience and improving psychological outcomes such as sympt oms of anxiety, depression, burnout syndrome, and PTSD.

Journal of General Internal Medicine. 2011;26(8):858-61. Background: Physician distress is common and related to numerous factors involving physicians' personal and professional lives. The present study was designed to assess the effect of a Stress Management and Resiliency Training (SMART) program for increasing re siliency and quality of life, and decreasing stress and anxiety among Department of Medicine (DOM) physi cians at a tertiary care medical center. Partici- pants: Forty DOM physicians were randomized in a wait -list controlled clinical trial to either the SMART intervention or a wait-list control group for 8 weeks. The intervention involved a single 90 min one-on- one training in the SMART program. Primary outcome measures assessed at baseline and week 8 included the Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CDRS), Perc eived Stress Scale (PSS), Smith Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Linear Analog Self Assessment Scale (LASA). Re sults: Thirty-two physicians completed the study. A 86 statistically significant improvement in resiliency, perceived stress, anxiety, and overall quality of life at 8 weeks was observed in the study arm compared to the wait-list control arm: CDRS: mean+/-SD Conclusions: A brief trai ning to enhance resilience and decrease stress among physicians using the SMART program was feasible. Furthe r, the intervention provid ed statistically signifi- cant improvement in resilience, stress, anxiety, and overall quality of life.

G Ital Med Lav Ergon. 2009;31(3 Suppl B):B25- 30. Aim: effects of workplace-based massage th erapy on physiological an d psychological outcomes. Methods: We used afield experiment in which 28 participants were rand omly assigned into either an ex- perimental (n = 14) or control (n = 14) group. Th e experimental group received weekly massage treat- ments at work for a four week period while the contro l group did not. Results: Both strain and blood pres- sure were significantly reduced duri ng treatment for the experimental group but not for the control group. Conclusions: This study provides initial support for the effectiveness of workplace-based massage therapy as part of a comprehensive workplace health strategy.

The Aickin separation test was used to assess feasibility of further research. Overall, 90% (337/375) of massage appointments were used. No significant effects were observed, but the Aickin sepa- ration test supported further resear ch on massage therapy for fatigue, pain, relaxation, and tension/dis- comfort. Conducting massage therapy in the workplace is logistically feasible. La rger, longitudinal trials are warranted to better evaluate its effects on staff. Pan W-Y, Xu G-X, Zeng F-L, Hao X-C. Effects of Daoistic cognitive therapy and acupoint massotherapy on job burnout in employees. Chinese Mental Health Journal. 2010;24(9):711-5. Objective: To explore the effects of Daoistic cognitive therapy and acupoint massotherapy on job burnout in employees. Methods: A total of 104 employees in three real estate companies were randomly divided into three intervention groups or a control group. The experimental group A, B and C received Daoistic cognitive therapy, acupoint massotherapy, and Daoist ic cognitive therapy combin ed with acupoint masso- therapy respectively for 4 weeks (twice a week). The control group received no treatment All the subjects were assessed with the Chinese Maslach Burnout Inventory (CMBI) before and after treatment, and one month after treatment Results: Sixty-nine subjects in three experimental groups completed the treatment The drop-out rate was 11.5 % (9/78). After intervention , the scores of emotional exhaustion were lower in the experimental group A, B and C than in the control gr oup ((22.-12 +/- 3. 2 3), (21. 16 +/-4. 01), (21. 13 +/- 3. 12) vs. (24.12 +/- 3.31), Ps < 0. 05). One mont h later, the scores of emot ional exhaustion was lower in the experimental group C than in the control group ( (2 1. 14 +/- 3. 71) vs. (24. 08 +/- 4. 21), P < 0. 01 ). But there was no significant difference in the scores of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization be- tween the other experimental groups and the control group. Conclusion : Both Daoistic cognitive therapy and acupoint massotherapy are effective on reducing emotional exhaustion, while Daoistic cognitive ther- apy combined with acupoint massotherapy may have the Work- place Improve Pe rceived Stress Reactivity of Men at Higher Risk.

Stress management interventions in the workplace improve stress reactivity: a randomised controlled trial. Occupational and environmental medicine. 2011;68(2):126-33. Objective: To examine the long-term effects of a stress management intervention (SMI) based on the ef- fort-reward imbalance (ERI) model, on psychological and biological reactions to work stress. Methods: 174 lower or middle management employees (99% male) were randomly assigned to an intervention or a waiting control group. The programme comprised 24 \u00d7 45 min group sessions (2 full days followed by two 4 \u00d7 45 min sessions within the next 8 months) on indi vidual work stress situations. The primary endpoint was perceived stress reactivity (Stress Reactivity Scal e, secondary endpoints were salivary cor- and -amylase, anxiety and depression, and ERI. Asse ssments were repeated in 154 participants 1 year later. Results: SRS score decreased in both groups. A two-factor ANOVA with repeated measures showed a significant time \u00d7 group effect (F=5.932; p=0. 016) with the greater redu ction in the intervention group. For SRS, the effect size (Cohen's d) after 1 ye ar was d=0.416 in the intervention and d=0.166 in the control group. -Amylase as a measure of sympathetic ne rvous system activation, decreased more strongly in the intervention group (area under the daytime curve and daytime slope: time \u00d7 group effect p=0.076 and p=0.075). No difference was observed fo r cortisol. For depression , anxiety and ERI, im- provements were higher in the intervention group bu t did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: 89 SMI based on work stress theory, is effective in redu cing perceived stress reacti vity and sympathetic acti- vation in lower and middle management employees. Other mental health parameters and ERI show a ten- dency towards improvement. These benefici al effects are present 1 year later. Logan MS, Ganster DC. An Experimental Evaluation of a Control Intervention to Alleviate Job-Related Stress. Journal of Management. 2005;31(1):90-107. This article reports the results of a randomized field experiment that tested the effects of a control-en- hancing stress intervention among unit managers of a trucking company. Individuals who managed geo- graphically dispersed profit centers were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (N=34) or a no-intervention group (N=30). The intervention increa sed perceptions of control after 4 months, but only for those managers with supportive supervisors. In co njunction with supervisory support, the intervention produced improvements in job satisfaction, but not general well-being outcomes. The impact of the inter- vention and supervisory support on satisfaction was fully mediated by control perceptions. Tabell A, et al. Effect of a par- ticipatory ergonomics intervention on psychosocial factors at work in a randomised controlled trial. Occup Environ Med. 2010;67(3):170-7. Objectives: To study the effect of a participatory er gonomics intervention on psychosocial factors among kitchen workers. Design: A cluster randomised controlled trial. Setting: Four cities in Finland, 2002- 2005. Participants: 504 workers in 119 municipal kitchens. Intervention : Kitchens were randomised to intervention (n=59) and control (n=6 0) groups. The intervention lasted 11-14 months and was based on the workers' active participation in work analysis, planning and implementing the ergonomic changes aimed at decreasing the physical an d mental workload. Main outcome measures: Mental stress, mental strenuousness of work, hurry, job sa tisfaction, job control, skill disc retion, co-worker relationships and supervisor support. Data were collected by questionnaire at baseline, at the end of the intervention, and at a 12-month follow-up (PI(12)). Resu lts: At the end of the intervention, the OR of job dissatisfaction for 90 the intervention group as compared with the control gr oup was 3.0 (95% CI 1.1 to 8.5), of mental stress 2.3 (1.2 to 4.7) and of poor co-wor ker relationships 2.3 (1.0 to 5.2). At the PI(12), the OR of job dissatis- faction was 3.0 (1.2 to 7.8). Analysis of the independ ent and joint effects of the intervention and uncon- nected organisational reforms showed that advers e changes were accentuated among those with expo- sure to both. Conclusions: No favourable effects on psychosocial factors at work were found. The adverse changes were due to a joint effect of the intervention and the unconnected organisational reforms. The findings do not support the usefulness of this kind of intervention in changing unsatisfactory psychoso- cial working conditions. Ekl\u00f6f M & Hagberg M. Are simple feedback interventions involving workplace data associated with bet- ter working environment and health? A cluster randomized con- study among Swedish and discussion of ergonomic and psychosocial working environment data during 1 short session with in dividual, groups, or supervisors of VDU workers had effects on (1) the quality of implemented modification s in workplace design, working tech nique, or psychosocial aspects; (2) psychological demands, decision latitude, and social support; (3) comfort during computer work, emotional stress, and prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms or eye discomfort. Methods: Thirty-six workgroups from 9 organizations were randomized to 3 feedback conditions (individual, workgroup, su- pervisor) or control. Follow-up was 6 months after intervention. Questionnaire data aggregated on the workgroup level were used. Results: Effect (positive) on social support was indicated from feedback to supervisors. Conclusion: Feedback and discussion of ergonomic and psychosocial working environment data with supervisors of white-colla r VDU workers may have positive e ffect on social support measured as a group characteristic. Sources of potential bias are discussed. 91 Tabell PK, Lam JH. Im- mental health in health care practitioners: randomized con- trolled trial of Consult Clin Psychol. 2015;83(1):177-86. Objective: Chronic occupational stress is common am ong health care practitioners, with potential im- pacts on personal mental health and staff turnover. This study investigated wh ether directing practition- ers' attention to thankful events in work could reduce stress and depressive symptoms. Method: A dou- bleblind randomized controlled trial was conducted in 5 public hospitals with follow-up to 3 months posttreatment. One hundred two practitioners were randomly assigned into 3 conditions: gratitude, has- sle, and nil-treatment. Those with scheduled long leaves were excluded. Participants in the gratitude and hassle group wrote work-related gratitude and hassle diaries respectively twice a week for 4 consecutive weeks. A no-diary group served as control. Depr essive symptoms (primary outcome) and perceived stress (secondary outcome) were collected at base line, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up. Intent-to- treat analyses were performed with mixed-effects re gression. Results: Signific ant Treatment x Time in- teraction effects were found for the gratitude interven tion, whether it was compared with control or has- sle; the general pattern was a decline in stress and de pressive symptoms over time, but the rate of de- cline became less pronounced as ti me progressed. Hassle and control were basically indistinct from each other. Relative to control, the gratitude group repo rted lower depressive sympt (-4.00, -1.30); d = -0.95) at follow- up. Results for the comparison between gratitude and hassle were similar. Conclusion: Taking stock of thankful events is an effective approach to reduce stress and depressive symptoms among health care practitioners. Duijts SF, Kant I, van den Brandt PA, Swaen GM. Effectiveness of a preventive coaching intervention for employees at risk for sickness ab- sence due to psychosocial health Objective: To assess the effectiveness of a preventive coaching intervention on sickness absence due to psychosocial health complaints and on general wellbeing of employees. Methods: Employees at risk for sickness absence were identified and randomized. The intervention group received the preventive coach- ing program; the control group received usual care. Primary outcome measure of the trial is sickness ab- 92 complaints: results of a randomized controlled trial. J Occup Environ Med. 2008;50(7):765-76. sence due to psychosocial health complaints; second ary outcome measures are related to general wellbe- ing, such as psychological distress, fatigue, and coping. Results: No effect of coaching on self-reported sickness absence due to psychosocial health complaints was found. The intervention group reported sta- tistically significant improved heal th, declined psychological distress, less burnout, less need for recov- ery, and an increased satisfaction with life. Conclusi ons: This study shows that the coaching intervention primarily has an effect on ge neral wellbeing of employees. Gunasingam N, Burns K, Edwards J, Dinh M, Walton M. Reducing stress and burnout in junior doc- tors: the impact of debriefing ses- sions. Postgrad Med J. 2015;91(1074):182-7. Internship and residency are difficult times with novi ce practitioners facing new challenges and stress- ors. Junior doctors may experience burnout, a syndrome that encompasses three dimensions: emotional exhaustion, depersonalisatio n and reduced personal accomplishment. While there is some existing liter- ature on the prevalence of burnout in junior doctors, there are few studies on interventional strategies. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of burn out in a cohort of junior doctors and whether de- briefing sessions reduced levels of burnout. A prospective randomised controlled study of a convenience sample of postgraduate year 1 doctors in a single hosp ital was undertaken during a rotation term in 2011. All participants completed a questionnaire using a va lidated tool, the Maslach Burnout Inventory, to de- termine the prevalence of burnout. They were then randomly assigned to a group who were to receive four debriefing sessions over 2 months, or, to the control group, who had no debriefing sessions. Quanti- tative and qualitative analyses were conducted. Thir ty-one postgraduate year 1 doctors participated in the study, with 13 being assigned to the group rece iving debriefing sessions and 18 assigned to the con- trol group. At baseline, 21/31 (68%) participants disp layed evidence of burnout in at least one domain as measured by the Maslach Burnout In ventory. Burnout was si gnificantly higher in women. There was no significant difference in burnout scor es with debriefing. The intervention was well received with 11/18 (61%) suggesting they would recommend the strategy to future junior doctors and 16/18 (89%) found that the sessions were a source of emotional and so cial support. Burnout is prevalent among postgradu- ate year 1 doctors, and they value the emotional and social support from attending debriefing sessions. A larger study is required to determin e if debriefing can reduce the incide nce of burnout in junior doctors. 93 Helms-Lorenz M, Bert S, van de Grift W. First year effects of induc- tion arrangements on beginning teachers' psychological processes. Eur J Psychol Educ. 2013;28:1265- 1287. This study examined the (1) effects of a supportive program (i.e., indu ction arrangement) on beginning teachers' (BTs') psychological processes after a period of 1 year and (2) psychological paths of influence of the arrangement. Participants (56 Dutch secondary schools with 143 BTs) were randomly allocated to two conditions. Experimental schools provided a carefully developed and implemented induction ar- rangement to their BTs. Control schools followed th eir regular (induction) a rrangements. BTs perceived stress causes, self-efficacy, and job strain were measured with a pre-test post-test design. Condition ef- fects were examined by means of independent sample t tests. The perception of the provided support was measured, and its psychological path of influence was investigated by conducting standard multiple regression analyses. BTs in the experimental condition indicated that they (1) received more support, (2) experienced fewer stress causes (i.e., lack of learning opportunities and lack of regulating possibilities), and (3) experienced more self-efficacy in the classroom at the end of the school year. Furthermore, fewer BTs left the experimental schools after 1 year. Reduci ng BTs' workload and suppo rting their professional development are the most influential induction arrangement elements provided in this study. Providing carefully developed and implemented induction arrang ements may soften the harshness of the context in which BTs operate, by decreasing their perceived stress causes and increasing their level of self-effi- cacy in the classroom. This, in turn, could positively affect BTs' decision to stay in the teaching profes- sion and might, therefore, add to a solu tion to the teacher shortage problem.

Structured Early Con- sultation with the Occupational Physician Reduces Sickness Absence Among Office Workers at High Risk for Long-Term Sickness Absence: a Objective: To examine the efficacy of structured early consultation among employees at high risk for fu- ture long-term sickness absence, in the prevention and/or reduction of sickness absence. The focus of the experiment was the timing of the intervention, that is, treatment before sickness absence actually oc- curs. Methods: In the current prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT), empl oyees at high risk for long-term sickness absence were selected based on responses to a 34-item screening questionnaire in- cluding demographic, workplace, health and psychoso cial factors associated wi th long-term sickness ab- sence (>28 days). A total of 299 subj ects at risk for future long-term sickness absence were randomized in an experimental group (n = 147) or in a control group (n = 152). Subjects in the experimental group 94 Randomized Controlled Trial. Jour- nal of Occupational Rehabilitation. 2008;18(1):79-86. received a structured early consult with their occupa tional physician (OP), in some cases followed by tar- geted intervention. The control group received care as usual. Sickness absence was assessed objectively through record linkage with the company registers on sickness absence over a 1 year follow-up period. Results: Modified intention-to-treat analysis revealed substantial and statistically significant differences (p = 0.007) in total sickness absence duration ov er 1 year follow-up between the experimental (mean 18.98; SD 29.50) and control group (mean 31.13; SD 55.47). Per-protocol anal ysis additionally showed that the proportion of long-term si ckness absence spells (>28 days) over 1 year follow-up was signifi- cantly (p = 0.048) lower in (9.1%) versus control group (18.3%). Conclusions: Struc- tured early consultation with the OP among employees at high risk for future long-term sickness absence is successful in reducing total sickness absence. Karatzias T, Choulia ra Z, Power K, Kilfedder C. Predicting outcome of face-to-face and telephone counsel- ling for occupational stress, British Journal of Guidance & Counselling. 2011;39:3, 197-208. The aim of the present study was to investigate predictors of outcome of counselling, using mean change scores of three outcome measures, at treatment completion and at 4-months follow-up, in a randomised trial of face-to-face (n = 30) versus telephone counselling (n = 30 ) for occupational stress. Factors asso- ciated with treatment outcome were investigated using regression analyses with the mean change scores in three self-rated measures, including the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation Scale (CORE), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) from pre- to post-interven- tion and pre-intervention to 4-months follow-up as the dependent variables and demographics, inter- vention-related and personality measures as independ ent variables. Irrespective of outcome measures and assessment points, it was found that the more severe the baseline sympto matology, the higher the degree of change was achieved. Clinical relevance of the present results and directions for future re- search are discussed. Kawakami N, Takao S, Kobayashi Y, Tsutsumi A. Effects of web-based supervisor training on job stressors and psychological distress among Using workplaces as a unit for randomization, a rand omized controlled trial wa s conducted to determine the effects of web-based supervisor training on the su bject of worksite mental health on job stressors, supervisor support and psychological distress among su bordinate workers. A total of eight workplaces of 95 workers: a workplace-based ran- domized controlled trial. J Occup Health. 2006;48(1):28-34. a sales and service company were randomly assigned to either training workplaces or non-training work- places. Supervisors (n=23) at the training workplaces participated in web-based self-learning training on worksite mental health; supervisors (n=23) at the non- training workplaces did no t. A total of 81 subordi- nate workers under the trained supervisors (the intervention group) and 108 subordinate workers under the non-trained supervisors (the control group) comp leted the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire (BJSQ) at baseline and at a three-month follow-up. No significan t intervention effect was observed for any scale of the BJSQ measuring job stressors, supervisor or co worker support, or psycho logical distress among sub- ordinate workers (p<0.05). The item score of work autonomy changed very little in the intervention group, while it decreased in the co ntrol group during the follow-up pe riod, yielding a significant inter- vention effect (p=0.02). The item sc ore for a friendly atmosphere in the workplace increased in the inter- vention group, while the score remain ed stable in the control group, yi elding a significant intervention effect (p=0.02). While the present study failed to show any clear effect of the web-based training of su- pervisors on reduction of job stressors, it may be useful for maintaining worker autonomy and improv- ing the friendliness of the worksite atmosphere.

A randomized trial of face-to- face counselling versus telephone counselling versus bibliotherapy for occupational stress. Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice. 2010;83(3):223-42. Objective: The aim of the present study was to compare the effectiveness and acceptability of three inter- ventions for occupational stress. Methods/design: A to tal of 90 National Health Service employees were randomized to face-to-face counse lling or follow-up. Clinical Outcomes in Ro utine Evaluation (CORE), General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) were used to evaluate in- tervention outcomes. An intention-to-treat analyses was performed. Results: Repeated measures analy- sis revealed significant time effects on all measures with the exception of CORE Risk. No significant group effects were detected on all outcome measures . No time by group signif icant interaction effects were detected on any of the outcome measures with the exception of CORE Functioning and GHQ total. With regard to acceptability of in terventions, participants expressed a preference for face-to-face coun- selling over the other two modalities . Conclusions: Overall, it was conc luded that the three intervention 96 groups are equally effective. Given that bibliotherapy is the least costly of the three, results from the pre- sent study might be considered in relation to a st epped care approach to oc cupational stress manage- ment with bibliotherapy as the firs t line of intervention, followed by telephone and face-to-face counsel- ling as required. Lucas BP, Trick WE, Evans AT, Weinstein RA, Varkey A, Smith J, et al. Four-vstwo- weekrotationsformedicinewardatten ding physicians: A cluster randomized cross-ov er trial. Journal of General Internal Medicine. 2011;26:S333. Background: Rotations for medicine ward attendin g physicians have become shorter. Whereas month- long rotations had been standard, two week rotations are now the norm. One driver for this change is the perception that shorter rotations improve physicians' work-life balance. Yet the psychological impact of rotation duration on physicians is not known. Nor is it known how rotation duration impacts patients or trainees. Methods: We conducted an unblinded, clus ter randomized crossover trial on the general medi- cine inpatient teaching service of a 450- bed public hospital during the 2009 academic year. We allo- cated random sequences of four- and two-week rotati ons to attending physicians who were scheduled for at least 6 weeks of inpatient service. All patients who were discharged from enrolled physicians' ward services throughout the study period constituted clus ters, and each cluster comp rised a random series of four- and two-week cluster-periods. The primary ou tcome was unplanned visits to our health care sys- tem within 30 days of discharge. Secondary outcomes were unplan ned readmissions to our hospital within 30 days of discharge (a subset of our primary outcome) and length of hospital stay. In addition, attending physician performance and work-life balance were measured on the last day of each rotation with confidential questionnaires. Resident questionnaires comprised 5 domains of attending physician performance: patient care, professionalism, clinical judgment, teaching skills, and feedback of resident performance. Attending physician questionnaires comp rised 3 domains of work-life balance: life stress using 4 items from the Cohen Perceived Stress Scale; emotional exhaustion using 9 items from the Hu- man Services Survey of the Maslac h Burnout Inventory; and perceived control in the workplace using 8 items from the Clinic Provider Survey of the Physic ian Worklife Study II. We generated summary scores for each questionnaire by transformi ng the sum of domain-specific z-scor es in to a single z-score; 1 z- score unit is equal to 1 standard deviation. We constructed multilevel models for each outcome, treating attending physician and the interact ion term attending physician-by-clu ster-period as random effects. 97 Models were hierarchically three-tiered with either patients or questionnaires (level 1) nested within cluster-periods (level 2) that were nested within at tending physicians (level 3). Results: Attending physi- cians (n=62) completed a median of 3 rotations (range 2 to 8) per physician. Median duration between rotations was 10 weeks (interquartile range 4 to 14 weeks). Among 77 four-week and two-week rota- tions, 6692 patients in an as-treated analysis. The unad- justed proportions of patients with 30-day unplanned visits was the same among patients from either four- or two-week rotations (25 %, 95% CI 24 to 26%) . The similarity of these proportions did not change in multilevel models that adjusted for clustering and allowed di rect within physician comparisons of four-week vs two-week rotations (odds ratio (OR) 0.98 , 95% CI 0.90 to 1.07). Secondary outcomes of 30- day readmissions (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0. 88 to 1.12), length of stay (0% change, 95% CI -4 to 3%), and resi- dents' of attending physi cians' performance (+ 0.01 SD, 95% CI -0.06 to +0.04 SD) were also not statistically different between fo ur- and two-week rotations. Attend ing physicians' reported work-life balance, however, worsened with four-week rotations (- 0.4 SD, 95% CI -0.6 to -0.3 SD); this effect re- mained after adding attending physic ian characteristics to the multilevel model. Whereas years of expe- rience, sex, number of dependents, and the interactio n term sex-by-number of dependents had no statis- tical association with work-life balanc e, being a hospitalist (0.7 SD 95% CI 0.3 to 1.0) and a graduate of an international medical school (0.6 SD95%CI 0.2 to 1.0) were associated with better work-life balance. Conclusion: Shorter attending physici an ward rotations did not affect 30-day unplanned revisits, length of hospital stay, or evaluations of attending physicians' performance. Shorter rotations did, however, im- prove attending physicians' work-life balance, part icularly among non-hospit medical Del Valle MP, Di Lalla S, Dom\u00ednguez P, Ormando L, et al. Impact of a brief intervention on the burnout levels of Objectives: To estimate burnout prevalence among pe diatric residents and to evaluate the impact of a brief intervention aimed at contro lling burnout. Methods: A randomiz ed controlled trial was conducted on 74 pediatric residents. The Maslach Burnout Inventory was administered to all subjects, and demo- graphic information was gathered (a ge, gender, children, cohabitants, and residency year). The experi- mental group (n = 37) participated in self-care work shops over the course of 2 months, and the control 98 pediatric residents. Jornal de pediatria. 2011;87(6):493-8. group (n = 37) did not receive any intervention. Af ter the intervention, the Maslach Burnout Inventory was administered again to all participants. All potentia l predictors of burnout were included in a logistic regression model. The efficacy of the intervention wa s evaluated by the chi-squa re test. P values < 0.05 were considered significant. Resu lts: The burnout prevalence among pediatric residents was 66%. After controlling for age, gender, children, and cohabitants, the prevalence of burnou t was significantly higher among third-year residents (odds ratio = 11.8; 95% co nfidence interval 2.3-59.3 ; p = 0.003). There were no significant differences regardin g burnout prevalence in the experi mental group between the baseline and post-intervention periods (p = 0. 8) or between the two groups after intervention (p = 0.8). The only difference observed was an improvement regarding \"depersonalization\" in the experimental group (p = 0.031). Conclusions: The burnout prevalence among pediatric residents was 66% and was higher among third-year residents. A brief interv ention was not effective in reducing burnout prevalence, despite the achievement of an improvement in \"depersonalization.\" Muller A, Heiden B, Herbig B, Poppe F, Angerer P. Improving Well-Being at Work: A Randomized Controlled Intervention Based on Selection, Optimization, and Compensation. Journal of Occupational Health Psychology. 2015:No Pagination Specified. This study aimed to develop, implement, and evaluate an occupational health intervention that is based on the theoretical model of selection, optimization, and compensation (SOC). We conducted a stratified randomized controlled intervention with 70 nurses of a community hospital in Germany (94% women; mean age 43.7 years). Altogether, the training consis ted of 6 sessions (16.5 hours) over a period of 9 months. The training took place in groups of 6-8 empl oyees. Participants were familiarized with the SOC model and developed and implemented a personal project based on SOC to cope effectively with 1 im- portant job demand or to activate a job resource. Co nsistent with our hypotheses, we observed a mean- ingful trend that the proposed SOC training enhanced mental well-being, particularly in employees with a strong commitment to the intervention. While highly committed training partic ipants reported higher levels of job control at follow-up, th e effects were not statistical signif icant. Additional analyses of mod- eration effects showed that the training is particul arly effective to enhance mental well-being when job control is low. Contrary to our a ssumptions, perceived work ability was not improved by the training. Our study provides first indications that SOC traini ng might be a promising approach to occupational health and stress prevention. Moreover, it identifies critical success factors of occupational interventions 99 based on SOC. However, additional studies are needed to corroborate the effectiveness of SOC trainings in the occupational contexts. Shipley P, Baranski JV. Police officer performance under stress: A pilot study on the effects of visuo- motor behavior rehearsal. International Journal of Stress Management. 2002;9(2):71-80. Examined the effectiveness of visuo-motor behavior rehearsal (VMBR) as a method of reducing acute stress and improving police officer performance. 54 recruits (mean age 27 yrs) were randomly assigned to a treatment and a non-treatment condition prior to undergoing a highly stressful, critical event train- ing scenario involving \"live fire\". A manipulation check showed that particip ants who received VMBR displayed significantly lower scores on the cognitive state anxiety subscale of the Competitive State Anxi- ety Inventory-2; somatic state anxi ety and self-confidence were unaffected by the VMBR treatment. Most importantly participants in the VMBR training condition displa yed better performance on the criti- cal event scenario, including signific antly more assailant \"hits\". The fi ndings are discussed with respect to the four-stage model of stress and human pe rformance of E. Salas and colleagues (1986). Torsney KM. Empowering lower status workers in long-term care: The impact of including CNAs and LPNs in interdisciplinary team meetings on their levels of turnover, stress, coping, and self-esteem: Columbia University; 2000. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impa ct of including certified nursing assistants (CNAs) and licensed practical nurses (LPNs) in interdisciplin ary team meetings at a long-term care facility on the variables of stress, turnover, coping, and self -esteem. Researchers examining organizational effec- tiveness and management in long-term care have sugg ested that a participatory collaborative approach to management leads to greater employee satisfacti on, performance, less stress and burnout, and im- proved patient care. The hypotheses tested in this study were that when CNAs and LPNs were included in interdisciplinary team meetings they would have less stress, greater self-esteem, more task-focused coping, and less turnover than those who did not pa rticipate in treatment team meetings. Stress was measured by the Care Provider Questionnaire (Mahairas, Oleasrsek, Bristol, Gurule, Kovacs, Peters, Uber, Joyce, Robinson, & Fagan, 19 90). Self-esteem was assessed by the Global Self-Esteem Scale (Ros- enberg, 1965) and coping was measured by the Multidimensionality of Coping Scale (Endler & Parker, 1990). Turnover was measured through examination of the numbers of individuals leaving the long-term care facility while the study was be ing conducted. Subjects were random ly assigned to conditions of par- ticipation in interdisciplinary treatment team meetings or to a control group. All subjects completed pre- 100 test and post-test assessments. The results were analyzed through anal yses of covariance, with the pre- test serving as the covariate. Within and between gr oup differences were also evaluated through analysis of variance tests. Correlations be tween the instruments were assessed through Kendall correlation coef- ficients. In addition, turnover was examined with Chi Square tests. The statistical analyses suggest that when CNAs and LPNs participate in treatment team meetings, although their levels of self-esteem, stress, and turnover do not significantly change, the amount of task centered coping which they employ is affected by the status of the worker (e.g. CNA or LPN). That is, the impact of being included in a treat- ment team meeting was more powerful for the lower st atus worker (CNA) than it was for the worker who had more status (LPN). Several factors such as smal l sample size, few behavioral measures, and the lack of a treatment control group may compromise the stre ngth of the study. Howeve r, several units at the long-term care facility noted that the inclusion of lo wer status workers led to improved patient care and that they would continue to include CNAs and LPNs in their team meetings in th e future. It is suggested that further investigation of this subject examine the variables of un it atmosphere, management style, and leadership style. West CP, Dyrbye L, Satele D, Shanafelt T. A randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of compass (colleagues meeting to promote and sustain satisfaction) small group sessions on physician well-being, meaning, and job satisfaction. Journal of General Internal Medicine. 2015;30:S89. Background: Burnout and low job sa tisfaction are all too common am ong physicians. However, studies evaluating interventions to address these issues have been limited. A pplication of validated instruments has been uncommon, and prior studies have been larg ely observational. A recent randomized study of facilitated physician meetings (West CP et al., JA MA Intern Med 2014;174(4)5 27-33) demonstrated im- provement in meaning and reduced depersonalizatio n in the intervention arm, but it is unknown whether less intensive and less structured forms of th is intervention would also be beneficial for physi- cian well-being. Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled a 6-month intervention involv- ing 12 biweekly one-hour oups of 6-8 academic inte rnal medicine physicians, termed COMPASS Groups (Colleagues Meeting to Promote And Sustain Sa tisfaction). Each intervention session consisted of a brief 15-min gr oup discussion of an assigned topi c relevant to the physician experi- ence and drawn from prior physician well-being literature , followed by 45 min for a shared lunch or other group activity as determined by each group itself. Each partic ipant received $20 per session for 101 meal expenses. Control participants were wait-listed to complete their own small groups after the initial 6 months to ensure equity in study reimbursement o pportunities. The small grou p topics included work- life balance, medical mistakes, meaning in work, and resiliency, among other topics relating to the physi- cian experience. Participants completed surveys at ba seline and then quarterly. Surveys included linear analog self-assessment of overall quality of life (QOL), the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the 2-item PRIME-MD depression screen, the Empowerment at Work Scale assessing meaning from work, the So- cial Isolation PROMIS instrument, and the Physician Job Satisfaction Scale. The trial groups were com- pared using generalized estimating equations for repe ated measures. Results: Of 125 study volunteers, 64and 61 participants were randomized to the interv ention and control arms of the study, respectively. At baseline, no statistically signif icant differences were observed between the study groups for any well- being variable. Results are shown in the Table (p<0.05 designated with an asteri sk in the Table for rele- vant outcome variables). Preliminary data also suggest sustai ned benefits up to 6 months after the end of the study intervention period for each outcome. Co nclusions: Study participants engaged in biweekly meetings with colleagues supported by modest study funds experienced st atistically and clinically signifi- cant improvements in multiple domains of well-being and satisfaction, including overall QOL, the deper- sonalization and personal accomplishment domains of burnout, meaning from work, social isolation, and job satisfaction. These results suggest that a rela tively non-intensive interv ention involving self-se- lected physician small group meetings can be effect ive in promoting physician well-being, meaning from work, and job satisfaction.

Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMD R) has been shown to be effective for treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but its efficacy as a stress management tool for normal individuals in highly stressful occupations has not been demonstr ated. 62 police officers (aged 23-53 yrs old) were randomly assigned to either EMDR or a standard stress management pr ogram (SMP), each consisting of 6 hours of individualized contact. At completion, officers in the EMDR condition provided lower ratings on measures of PTSD symptoms, subj ective stress, job stress, and anger; and higher marital satisfaction ratings than those in SMP. The effects of EMDR were maintained at the 6-month follow-up, indicating 102 International Journal of Stress Management, 2001;8(3):179-200. enduring gains from a relatively brief treatment regime n for this subclinical sample of officers who were experiencing some level of stress from their job.
