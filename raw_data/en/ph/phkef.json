acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Herbal Remedies can be of great benefit. It can restore balance to your reproductive and endocrine system by enhancing blood flow to the reproductive organs, regulating menstruation, ovulation, and improving egg quality. An experienced TCM acupuncturist would analyze all the information and body signs provided by the patient, such as pulse, tongue reading, and menstrual history, and then formulate a treatment strategy that is customized for this particular patient. TCM can also provide relief from morning sickness and fatigue. Acupuncture treats high blood pressure, edema, sciatica, and back pain in the second and third trimester. Acupuncture is reducing stress, which is often a critical factor in the infertility of men and women. Stress releases cortisol in the brain, which disrupts the brain neurochemical balance, changes hormonal level, and disrupts the pituitary balance that is key to the reproductive cycle. Acupuncture is a part of Traditional Chinese Medicine and has been practiced for thousands of years. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, our body has unique pathways for energy flow called Meridians. They conduct the energy (called Qi) between the surface of the body and internal organs. Qi regulates spiritual, emotional, mental, and physical balance. Disruption of the energy flow through poor health habits or other circumstances leads to pain or disease. Acupuncture helps to keep the normal flow of Qi unblocked, thereby increasing a couple's chances of conceiving.

They now use their proven herbal formulas from years of experience and protocols to treat women and men's fertility problems. They often work with MD OBGYN specialists in co-treating patients.
