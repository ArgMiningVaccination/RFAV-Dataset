No. I'm Waiting Last updated: 8th May 2023 Some simple statistics to begin with: - We have had over 11,472,000 positive cases of Covid here in Australia. - Nearly 30% of those cases have been asymptomatic where the person was not even aware that they had the virus. - There have only been 980 deaths DIRECTLY related to Covid viral infection ('from' not 'with'). - Only 80 people have died directly from Covid in Australia under the age of 70. - The median age of death from/with Covid here in Australia is 86.7 years of age. - Novavax is the injection to wait for - it is closer to the traditional vaccines we have used over the past 40-50 years. It is far safer than Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca. - Don't fall for the fear mongering about new variants - we know that as a virus mutates, each variant can become more transmissible (easier to spread) but they always become less deadly. Coronaviruses will be around for a long time to come but they will kill fewer people as mutations and new variants are discovered. - Omicron - the current injections available have very little effect on this new variant. Studies on this variant over the last 2 months have shown it to only produce mild symptoms and no deaths. Oxford Naturopathics has three COVID protocols to choose from: [Foundation Heart Recovery and Repair Protocol](https://naturopathics.com.au/covid-protocol/foundational-heart-recovery-repair-protocol/)- for those who have a wide variety of injuries from Covid Vaccines [COVID Jab Protection/Detox Pack](https://naturopathics.com.au/covid-protocol/vaccine-detox-protection-protocol/)- for those who have taken the Covid Vaccine [Clinical 'No Vaccine' Pack](https://naturopathics.com.au/covid-protocol/no-vaccination-protocol/)- for those who have not taken the Covid Vaccine Important tips There are health risks with getting the jab and there are health risks with not getting the jab. The only way of controlling all the risks is by building a strong and resilient immune system. Whatever your decision - it all comes down to how well your immune system functions. Be wise and follow the steps below to keep yourself and those around you safe: - Take your Covid Protocol every day - Keep 1.5 meters away from others - Take your hand sanitiser with you everywhere - Don't go out if you feel any symptoms of sickness "}
