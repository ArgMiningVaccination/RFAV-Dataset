Besides those conditions, Bulgaria's location amid the constant turmoil oftheBalkans alsoshaped domestic lifeand for- eign policy, even years.

Despite thisprocess, however, thetraditional visible inthenational of1990and1991: Bul- garia's urban population largely supported economic andpolitical reform platforms, whereas therural regions expressed skepticism about reform bysupporting themore conventional programs of theBulgarian Socialist Party (BSP, formerly theBulgarian Com- munist Party (BCP)). Besides speeding urbanization, postwar industrial policy putmost means ofproduction under centralBCP control. The state alsotook over theBulgarian financial system, andagriculture underwent a series ofcollectivization phases between 1947and1958. Follow- ingthestandard recipe forcentralized economic planning, heavy industry received ofstateinvestment compared with agriculture andconsumer production. Theever-increasing quotas offive-year plans forallthose sectors, however, reflected unrealistic expectations. Although later five-year plans aimed at more realistic goals, thecentralized Bulgarian economic system failed consistently toincrease output, although itdevoted huge amounts ofresources totheeffort. Throughout thecommunist era, heavy industries lacked incentives because ofstate subsidies, and state-run agriculture never matched theproductivity ofsmall advancement. Asintheother EastEuropean countries, central planning ofthe economy produced severe environmental damage inBulgaria. Damage wasmore localized because industries\" than thatof Poland, Czechoslovakia, ortheGerman Democratic Republic (East Germany). Nevertheless, cities such asRuse, Dimitrovgrad, and Srednogorie suffered severe environmental deterioration from manufacturing activities under thecommunist regimes, which dis- regarded pollution inthename ofprogress.

Thecommunist erahadprovided very basic health care instate regional clinics available tomost Bulgarians. Under thesocialist health system, indicators such asaverage lifeexpectancy, infant mortality rate,andphysicians percapita improved steadily adifficult transition period thatyielded uneven results. Theoverthrow ofZhivkov's orthodox communist regime in1989 produced especially dramatic changes inBulgarian political and economic life.Bythemid-1980s, theZhivkov regime already had inability todealwithnew political many Bulgarians, especially theeducated classes. Zhivkov took token political restructuring measures inthelate1980s, butby1988 formidable opposition groups wereforming around such issues as andthechronic failure thelabor forceandevoked strong protest from theinternational community andmany groups within Bulgaria.

Privatization brought many difficult dilemmas forasystem that until recently hadbeen centrally planned. Thenewgovernment hadtodistinguish state enterprises worth ofclaims proved ex- tremely complex. Andrapid privatization inevitably displaced large numbers ofworkers from former state enterprises, damaging productivity, national morale, andearning power. InFebruary 1992, theWorld Bank cited thelackofprivatization legislation theSoviet Union firstended coal supply andlaterwhen subsidized electric power supply toBulgaria following thedissolution oftheSoviet Union. Because Bulgaria's domestic energy basewasquite inadequate tosupport anindustrial system designed when outside energy supplies were plentiful andcheap, economic recovery depended onthesingle nuclear power plant atKozloduy\u2014afacility judged unsafe byboth domestic andinternational authorities in1991. Lacking foreign cur- rency toprovide asmuch ashalfthecountry's in1991made accelerated likely.

Although Bulgarian society wasethnically relatively ous, especially itybyappealing toethnic Bulgarian fears thatempowering Turks within Bulgaria would once again threaten Bulgarian security. xxxvn When Zhivkov fell,restoration oflong-withheld civil rights became acentral issue inthenewly open political atmosphere. Minority rights found expression inthenew political order; the MRF wasformed toadvance rights forallTurkish citizens ofBulgaria. Especially ineastern Bulgaria where theTurkish population was largest, a strong undercurrent ofhostility grew in1991and1992between ultranationalist Bulgarians and theirTurkish neighbors. Only a Supreme Court the1991 election, majority, foreign domination. thepolitical with only partially rights, andschool boycotts were called insome areaswhere theuseofTurkish remained restricted. On this issue, theBulgarian court system, which hadbeen apurely political institution under thenewantidiscrimi- nation language ofthatdocument hadnever before been tested and partly because ofthelingering tradition ofjudicial dependency on political officials. Meanwhile, politicians generally treated theTurk- ishissue with great caution in1991andearly 1992. Nationalist factions UDF for itslegislative \"alliance\" with theMRF, suggesting thatUDFcompromises would jeopardize national security. These conditions lessened thelikelihood thatthe National Assembly would finally attack andresolve to po- litical relations butalsoensure continued supply ofrawmaterials, especially fuels. Negotiations with theSoviet government yielded promises ofcontinued supply, butby1991 theSoviet republics responsible fordelivery were able toignore thecommitment. This situation deteriorated further when theSoviet Union dissolved into constituent republics inthe fallof1991.ByJanuary 1992, Bul- gariahadestablished relations with Belarus, Russia, theBaltic inaneffort toreestablish aswell asinRussia, Kazakhstan, andUkraine.

Environmental Problems Although Bulgaria hashadserious environmental problems for some time, theywere notopenly discussed until theoverthrow of Zhivkov. Ecological groups were attheforefront ofanti-Zhivkov demonstrations in1989,when anall-European ecology conference focused world attention onSofia. After acknowledging theproblem, post-Zhivkov policy makers rated degradation oftheair,water, and soilasoneofthemost serious problems facing Bulgaria.

Economic Structure Mechanisms Until late1989, Bulgaria hadacommand economy based oncen- tralized planning rather thanonmarket ofoutput, industrialization, large-scale investments, andother resource allocation toheavy industry atthe faroutweighed toavoid. Theoretically, CPEs weredesigned atedwitheconomic downturns. (Astheir national economies be- camemore interrelated with international markets, however, CPE proponents admitted thedifficulty ofisolating themselves from swings inworld economic conditions.) Another theoretical advan- tagewasthateconomic decisions could ofscale could beincorporated intotheplanning process. Western economists were generally critical oftheCPE, however. Their criticisms hadtwoessential components. These general assertions proved much, lesthigher targets besetinthenext over theproducer when quality waslow,andtheartificial price structure prevented price signals from alerting producers toconsumer preferences. Also, because enterprises werejudged ontheir producers geared production levels forsatisfying theplan, notconsumers. TheCPE could induce technical progress from itcould notstimulate itfrom below.

ThePlanning System Prior to1990, theplanning hierarchy inBulgaria included several levels. Theultimate economic authority wastheBCP.Theparty determined general economic policies, identified economic reforms and their structure, andmonitored economic activity. Planning andcontrol were theState Planning Committee (SPC). Within theCouncil of were specialized ministries, such powers were eliminated and fivecabinet-level \"voluntary associations\" were The after- math fewnewpower relation- ships.

After theinitial postwar climb, four decades ofsocialist central planning had lefttheindustrial sector inaverypoor state. Industrial Centers Bulgarian heavy industries, mostly machine building, chemicals, and electronics, were concentrated inrelatively fewproduction centers. Important machine toolplants were Vaptsarov Combine atPleven, and theRadomir Heavy Equipment Plant insouthwest Bulgaria.

Atthat point, theonlyfunds thestate received from agriculture were 60 percent offoreign currency from exports. Even then,government delivery prices remained solowthat state foodstuff monopolies received only theabsolute minimum supply. In1989 theexodus of310,000 ethnic Turks, many ofwhom hadcultivated personal plots, alsohurt agricultural output. Despite these handicaps, theUnited States Department of Agriculture estimated thatwithin Eastern Europe Bulgaria was sec- ondonly toHungary inagricultural trade surpluses through 1987. After thattime, however, products wasbanned in1990. Agricultural Products Two long-term policies strongly determined priorities inBul- garian agricultural production after 1960.

Trade with theWest andtheThird World After 1960 Bulgaria's trade with theWest increased, partly be- cause Bulgaria needed Western machinery tosupplement theout- dated, overpriced manufacturing equipment supplied byComecon. Between 1960and1975, theWestern share ofBulgarian imports went from 13.6 percent to23.6 percent. Inthesame period, however, exports dropped from 12.4 to9.3percent, creating an external debtproblem with theWest. Increased exports toThird World nations did little tohelpBulgaria reduce thistrade deficit because mostThird World tradewasnotinconvertible currencies.
