The practice of holistic medicine integrates conventional and alternative therapies to prevent and treat disease, and most importantly, to promote optimal health. This condition of holistic health is defined as the unlimited and unimpeded free flow of life force energy through body, mind, and spirit. Holistic medicine encompasses all safe and appropriate modalities of diagnosis and treatment. It includes analysis of physical, nutritional, environmental, emotional, spiritual and lifestyle elements. Holistic medicine focuses upon client education and participation in the healing process. Holistic treatment is more of an approach rather than a treatment; it focuses on the person's whole being - his physical, emotional, mental and spiritual wellness that need to be addressed. The holistic treatment is into more of the lifestyle of the person and identifies the imbalances which may cause some negative effects to the person's health. It focuses on the root cause of the ailment and counter it by encouraging the person to strive for wholeness and healthy living.
