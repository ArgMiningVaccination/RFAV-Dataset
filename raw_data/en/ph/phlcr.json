Both Humic Acids and MSM are taken up by plants from soil and water for growth. Both are also natural sources of minerals. Humic Acids contain 70+ minerals including potassium, magnesium, sulfur, calcium, boron and silicon, while MSM is a potent source of organic sulfur. In combining these two ingredients in one supplement, your body has access to a complete range of natural digestible minerals. Minerals need to be taken together for best effect - they work synergistically for healing. Humic Acids and MSM are believed to have similar modes of action - alleviating inflammatory conditions by inhibiting the production of cytokines(1,10,11). MSM also acts as a nutrient delivery system. MSM has shown the ability for increasing the permeability of other nutrients when taken at the same time(13). Healing Earth is the only supplement that combines MSM with Humic Acids to optimize the absorption of its wide variety of nutrients. Both Humic Acids and OptiMSM\u00ae have very established safety profiles for human health use. For more details "}
