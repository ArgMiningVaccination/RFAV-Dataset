You might like to close your eyes and count backwards from 30 to help to still your thoughts, or take a few unforced, deep, slow breat hs. Then, hold the scent to your nose; sniff a few times to gain an initial impression. Focus your attention on your sense of smell, and continue to sniff, as needed, for a few moments. Notice the different notes that emerge, and then let them go. The s cent will keep changing, sometimes obviously, sometimes this will be subtle. Discard any mental distractions that arise and keep returning to the scent. Then, holding the scent to your nose again, inhale deeply three times. Imagine your consciousness dis solving outward to the scent, feel as though you can touch it, merge with it, flow into it. When you feel you have reached the point of saturation, detach yourself from all senses but smell. Descend deeply inside, bearing the essence of the scent you have chosen, and touch it with your vision of the scent. Build an inner picture of the essence - the essence of the essence. Imagine it as an object, or something abstract, a sound, a color or shape, a plant, an animal, a scene, a place - anything that seems t o you to be conjured by the deep impression of the scent. Focus on the heart chakra and notice if the scent brings up any emotions for you. If these are negative emotions, try tapping with your finger pads on the 'tender spot' near the collar bone. Find t he notch in your neck and travel over (to either side) about 2 inches and put your fingers slightly under the collar bone. Tap there vigorously as you silently say the emotion, such as 'fear' or 'anger'. Focus on the third eye and notice if the scent brin gs up any thoughts for you. If these are negative thoughts, try tapping with your finger pads at inner eyebrow near the center of the third eye (either right or left eyebrow is fine). As you tap, silently repeat the thought, such as 'greed' or \"blame\". Tapping on these Acupoints creates a beneficial subtle energy flow while saying the negative emotion or thought, which can break the chain of negativity between the scent and the emotions or thoughts. Turn outward again, and consciously smell the scent agai n. Repeat the outer phase and inner phase until you feel that the experience has reached a natural conclusion. You will find that each scent you meditate upon creates a different internal image and meditative experience. "}
