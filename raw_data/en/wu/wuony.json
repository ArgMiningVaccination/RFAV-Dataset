ADAMS, Plaintiff, vs. HEAL TH PROF ESSIONALS, LT D., WEXFO RD HEALTH SOURCES, INC., ADRIAN F EINERM AN, and AND ORDER REAGAN, District Judge: A. Introduction & Procedural Overview John K. Adams, an inmate in the custody of the Illinoi s Department of Corre ctions (IDOC), presents deliberate indifference claims herein. His comp laint survive d threshold revi ew in December 2008. Prior Orders of th is Cour t dismiss ed va rious claims, leaving four rema ining Defen dants scheduled to proceed to final pretrial conference Februa ry 5, 2010 and jury trial March 1, 2010: (1) Health Profe ssionals, Ltd., (2) Wexford Health So urces, Inc ., (3) Ad rian Fein erma n, and (4) Seth Osafo. Those four Defen dants moved for summary judgment on Octob er 5, 2009 and supplemen ted their suppor ting memor andum three days later with leave of Court. Repre sente d by counsel, Plaintiff Adams obtained an extension of time to respon d thereto and filed a memor andum opposing summary judgment on November 30, 2009. The issues have be en thorough ly briefed. For the reasons state d below, the undersigne d District Judge grant s in part and denies in p art Defen dants' moti on fo r summary jud gment (Doc. 30). B. Applic able L egal Sta ndards John Adams proceeds herein under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. His claims relate to the conditions of his prison confinement at Pinckneyville Corre ctional Center and Illinoi s River Corre ctional Center. Adams alleges that he suffers from serious medical ailments and that Defen dants responded to those serious medical needs with deliberate indifference. Noting that summa ry judgment is the \"put up or shut up mome nt in a laws uit\" (Doc. 30, p. 12), Defen dants maintain that the evidence utterly fails to suppor t any of Adams' allegati ons, entitling all four of th em to judgment on all claims. Summar y judgment is proper where the plead ings, de positions, answers to interrogat ories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genui ne issue as to any mate rial fact and that the movin g party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). Accord Durable Mfg. Co. v. U.S. Department of Labor, 578 F.3d 497, 501 (7 Cir. 2009); Twenhafe l v. State Auto Prop.th and Cas. Ins.

In ruling on a summary judgment motion, this Court must construe the facts and draw all reasonab le inferences in the light most favor able to the non-movi ng party. Tas Distri buting Co., Inc. v. Cummins Engine Co., Inc., 491 F.3d 625, 630 (7 Cir.th 2007); Reynolds v. Jamiso n, 488 F.3d 756, 764 (7 Cir. 2007); Anderson v. Libertyth Lobby, Inc ., 477 U.S. 24 2, 255 (1986). -2-To survive a summary judgment motion, the nonmovan t (here, Plaintiff Adams) must set forth speci fic facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. Vana sco v. Nat'l-Lou is Univ., 137 F.3d 962, 965 (7th Cir. 1998). Stated another way, the party opposing summary judgment must provi de evidence on which the jury could find in his favor . See Maclin v. SBC Ameritech , 520 F.3d 781, 786 (7 Cir. 2008). As theth United States Court of Appe als for the Sevent h Circu it dec lared six mont hs ago in Trade Finance P artners, LLC v. AAR Corp., 5 73 F.3 d 401 , 406-07 (7 Cir. 20 09):th To survive summary judgment , \"ther e must be evidence on which the jury could reasonab ly find for the nonmovin g party, ... and the nonmoving party must point to speci fic facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial; inferences relying on mere specu lation or conjecture will not suffice.\" Argyropo ulos v. City of Alton , 539 F.3d 724, 732 (7 Cir. 2008).th Adams claims deliberate indifference by Defen dants. In Estelle v. Gamble , 429 U.S. 97 (1976), the Supre me Court held that the Eighth Amen dmen t's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishme nt imposes a duty upon state s to provi de adequate medical care to inmate s. Failure to provi de medical care violat es the Eighth Amen dmen t when there is \"delibe rate indifference\" to a substan tial risk of harm. Farmer v. Brennan , 511 U.S. 8 25, 834 (1994); Sherrod v. Lingle , 223 F.3d 60 5, 610 (7th Cir. 2000). Delibe rate indifference is \"more than ordinary lack of due care for the prisoner' s inte rests or safet y.\" Whitley v. Albe rs, 475 U.S. 312, 319 (1986 ). Instead, the plaintiff must estab lish: (1) his medical condition was objectively serious, and (2) the defendants were subje ctively aware of the medical need and disregarde d an excessive risk to the inmate's health . Wynn v. Southwa rd, 251 F.3d 58 8, 593 (7th Cir. 2001). -3-The Seventh Circuit has explai ned it this way. States have an affirmative duty to provid e medic al care to their inma tes. The upshot of thi s duty is that deliber ate indifference to a prisoner' s serious medical needs constitutes the unnecessary and wanto n infliction of pain, whi ch violat es the Eighth Ame ndme nt. To demo nstrate deliberate indifference, a plaintiff must demo nstrat e an objectively serious medical condition to which a state official was deliberately, i.e., subjecti vely, indifferent. Duckworth v. Ahma d, 532 F.3d 675, 678-79 (7 Cir. 2008). th See also Greeno v. Daley , 414 F.3d 645, 652-53 (7 Cir. 2005). In certainth circumstanc es, delays in treating painful non-life-threatening conditions also can suppor t Eighth Amen dmen t claims. Johnson v. Doughty , 433 F.3d 1001, 1017 (7th eters , 111 F.3d 13 64, 1371 (7 Cir. 19 97).th When considering whether an inmate's medical care demo nstrat es delib erate indifference to his serious medical needs, the Court looks at the inmate 's medical care as a whole . Gutierrez, 111 F.3d at 1374. With respe ct to medical personne l, the Court will infer deliberate indifference if poor treatme nt decisions represen t a substan tial McCaughtry , 266 F.3d 724, 734 (7th Cir. 2 001). C. Analysis \u00feFACTUAL BACKGROUND Adams ha s been in and out of the IDOC n umerous times. He has served h is sente nces at a variety of facilities, including Pontiac Corre Center, and Corre ctional Center. The issues in this case pertain to Ada ms' con finement at different periods of time at different locat ions. Specifically, Adams alleges that he suffere d from sever al \"pre-existing debilitating medical conditions and disab ilities, that kept him in severe and chronic pain, and that ... required speci al orthopedic treatme nt and intensive, ongoi ng pain manageme nt,\" including a knee replacement, a degenerative bone condition, nerve dama ge to his left leg, and the fact his left leg was approxima tely two inches shorte r than his right leg (Comp laint, Doc. 2, p. 5). Adams contends that during his incarceration with IDOC, he was subje cted to \"ongoi ng and continuous acts of deliberate indifference\" that were \"gener ally attributable to\" a custom or policy (established or encouraged by Defen dants) to delive r only nominal health care to IDOC inmate s through private provi ders at the cheapest possible cost (Doc . 2, p. 6). \u00feDELIBERATE INDIFFERENCE To estab lish deliberate indifference in the instant case, Adams must show that Defen dants knew about and disregarde d a serious medical condition posin g a risk to his health. Burks v. Raemisch, 555 F.3d 592, 593-94 (7th Cir. at 679. As noted above, Defen dants must have actually drawn the inference of a substan tial risk of serious harm. See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837; Duckworth, 532 F.3d at 679. Accord Dale 569 (7 Cir. 2008)(\"an inmate has noth [deliberate indifference ] claim 'unles s the official knows of and disregards an excessive -5-risk to inmate health or safety;'\" there must be both a grave risk and actual knowled ge by the Defenda nt of that ri sk). Because Adams has targeted treatme nt decisions, an inference of deliberate indifference will be drawn if the evidence shows a substan tial departure from accepted profe ssional judgment , Sain v. Wood, 512 F.3d 886, 895 (7th Cir. 2008 ), or a deci sion to withh old treatme nt v. Benjamin, 293 F.3d (7th Cir. 2002). In other words, Defen dants must have acted with intentional or criminally reckless disregard whe n they mad e treatme nt decisions regardi ng Ada ms. \u00feEVIDENTIARY MATTERS The record before this Court is volumin ous, and the parties have not been selecti ve in submit ting informa tion. After reviewing the exhibits and affidavits, the Court finds it necessary to note that any findings under Rule 56 must be based on documents and testimony having evidentiary quality. FED. R. CIV. P. 56(e). The undersigne d Judge has focused on the evidence that is releva nt to the claims and defe nses in t his case. \u00feDEFENDANT FEINERMAN Adrian Feinerman is a medical doctor who speci alizes in internal medicine and has training in orthopedics. As an employee of Wexford Health Sourc es, Inc.,1 Feinerma n worked at Pinckneyville Corre ctional Center. He was the medical director of that facility, whi ch is designa ted as a di sabled i nmates. Wexford Health Sourc es, Inc. and Health Professionals, Ltd. are1 vendors of health c are servic es to seve ral IDOC facilities. -6-Adams' c laim a gainst Dr. Feine rman pertains to a period of time beginning in July 2004 and conti nuing through April 2005. Durin g tha t period, Ada ms was confined at Pinckneyville Corre ctional Center (Pinckneyville). Adams had serious medical needs arising from his history of traumatic injury in a moto rcycle accident. Adams' left leg and knee are fused. A rod a nd seve ral pin s conn ect his left leg bo nes to his left hi p. Adams has \"foot drop,\" cha racterized b y an i nability to suppo rt his left fo ot. Adams also h as a leg length di screp ancy. His left leg i s roughly 2 \u00bd inch es shorte r in length t han his right leg. As a result of these conditions, Adams' ability to walk unassisted is impaired. Adams also has subje ctive complai nts of ba ck pai n and oth er pa in. Shoe lift. In July 2002, before the period in question, Adams was evaluate d by a physic al therapist. The physic al therapist prepared a report which became part of Adams' medical file. A 2-inch shoe lift was recommen ded, based on the therapist's finding tha t Ada ms' leg l ength di sparity altere d his gait a nd aggrava ted his symptoms of back pain. Adams was relea sed from prison in August 2002. He purchased a shoe lift from Carle Hospi tal in Champaign, Illinoi s. On arrival at Pinckneyville in Octob er 2004, Adams had a lift in his shoe, which may have been the one purchased through Carle Hospita l. When Adams learn ed2 that this shoe lift was constructed with a meta l stave and did not meet prison security Evidenc e on this point is confusing. For purposes of this motion,2 the Cour t infers that Ad ams purchased but did not rec eive a shoe lift during his 2004- 2005 c onfinement at Pinc kneyville. -7-restri ctions, he ordered a replacement lift through a prosth etics vendor. Delay in the delive ry of the re place ment resulte d in Adams spend ing many mon ths walking witho ut a lift in his left shoe . At some point, Feinerma n evaluate d Adams' request for a state -issued shoe lift. Feinerma n reviewed Adams' medical file and learn ed about the physic al therapist's recommen dation in favor of a 2-inch shoe lift. Feinerma n declined to order a shoe lift based on his belief that Adams would not be walking long distances or walking on uneven surfac es in the prison environment. At the time, Feinerma n was aware that persons who regular ly walk with an uncorrected leg length discrepancy can develop spinal or back problems. Durin g this period of confinement, Adams experienced tremendous pain in his back, hip , leg and foot. His s ymptoms worsene d after he walked with out a shoe lift. Leg brace. On August 6, 2004, Feinerma n approved Adams' use of an ankle- foot orthotic device or \"AFO.\" Pain medication. In January 2005, Feinerma n admitted Adams to the prison infirma ry after Adams said he had too much pain to walk. Feinerma n ordered \"light\" medicines for pai n relief a nd approved a diagnostic test. In Februa ry 2005, Feinerma n reviewed the test results. He thought the tests showed norma l spina l changes for persons in Adams' age group and did not identify objective suppor t for Adams' subje ctive comp laints of pain. In particular, Feinerma n determined that an old fracture was well-healed and would not cause severe pain. He also thought a prior bone infection (oste omyeliti s) was not an active problem. Adams was -8-disch arged from the infirma ry witho approxima despi te his comp laint of immobi lizing pa in. On another occasion in 2005, Feinerman evaluated Adams' comp laints of severe pain and ordered diagnostic tests. Feinerma n did not notify Adams of the test results and did not order pain relief medications. Adams did not see Feinerma n again3 before he was tran sferred to Po Corre ctional Cente r in April 200 5. Physica l therapy. On several unknown dates, Feinerma n declined to order physic al therapy. He recommen ded self-admi nistere d stretc hing, exercise, and walking. Adams walked to the prison gymnasium and lifted weight s; howeve r, these efforts at self- rehabilitation were n ot suc cessful. Eggcra te mattress. In August 2004, a doctor evaluate d Adams' comp laints of sleep issues and denied his request for a speci al \"eggcrat e\" mattress. The decision was likely based on Feinerma n's view that this type of mattress would create a fire hazard in a prison s etting. The re port gene rated re flects th at Ad ams had no medi cal need for the speci al matt ress. Special use permits. On August 6, 2004, Feinerman approved a medical permit restri cting Adams to a low bunk assignmen t. He also approve d a permit giving Adams access to a speci al exercise yard reserve d for physic ally challenged inmate s. The Court has consider ed information suggesting that Adams was3 addicted to pain medic ations in the past. The evide nce does not link this aspect of Adams' medic al histor y to Feinerman' s treatment dec isions in 2004 and 2005. -9-Feinerma n felt th e spec ial yard would presen t fewer dangers from oth er inmates. Refer ral for consultat ion. Feinerma n did not refer Adams to an orthopedic speci alist for a consultati ve examination. Feinerma n argue s that the evidence could not suppor t a finding that he respon ded to Adams' serious medical ailments with a suffic iently culpable state of mind. He relies primarily on Greeno v. Daley , 414 F.3d 645 (7th Cir. 2005), in which a failure to pursue furth er testing for a possible ulcer for 2 years was held to suppor t a deliberate indifference claim. In particular, the defendants in Greeno \"doggedly persisted in a course of treatme nt known to be ineffective.\" Id. at 655. Feinerma n argue s that any incorrect diagnosis or trea tmen t would de monstra te - at worst - n egligen t conduct. In response, Adams also relie s on Greeno , posit ing tha t the evide nce could suppor t an inference that Feinerma n actu ally knew that he had signifi cant levels of pain and refu sed to t ake step s to obta in or pro vide effective tre atme nt. The Court is not persuade d that the holding in Greeno logica lly extends to this fact pattern. In Greeno , the defendants banned treatme nt, gave medicine known to be ineffective, and gave medicine known to aggrava te the inmate 's condition. They also refused to approve a diagnostic test (endosco py) that ultima tely led to imme diate, successful treatme nt. Feinerma n did not ban treatment but provi ded severa l forms of treatme nt, including recommen ded exercises, over-the-counter medicine, a low bunk permit, a physic ally challenged yard permit, temp orary place ment in the infirma ry, diagnostic tests, an d access to an ankle-foot orthotic device. -10-No facts suppor t a finding that Feinerman refused to approve a test that would have led to a quick diagnosis of Adams' pain and effective treatme nt. The evidence could suppor t the inference that some of Feinerma n's treatme nt choi ces (self-regu lated exercise, over-the-counter pain medicine) were not effective and may amou nt to an error in medi cal judgmen t. Bu t the evidence consid ered as a whole d oes no t show delib erate indifference. That is, the materi als on file could not suppor t a finding that Feinerman 's treatme nt choices fell far afield of the profe ssional norm for treatme nt of Adams' ailments or that Feinerma n deliberately selecte d poor treatme nt choices as a form of gratu itous cruelty. On the se fac ts, Fein erma n is en titled to j udgme nt in his favor.4 \u00fe Defendant Dr. Osafo Seth Kwabe na Osafo is a medical docto r with a specialty in internal medicine. Osafo served as medical director of the Illinoi s River Corre ctional Center from 2004 to 2008. While working at Illinoi s River , Osafo was an employee of Wexford Health Services. Plaintiff Adams arrived at Illinoi s River around May 24, 2006, and on severa l occasion s was seen by Dr. Os afo. Osafo a rgues th at his respon se to Adams' medical ailments doe s not qualify as delibe rate indifference. Adams' claims against Osafo relates to Adams' confinement at Illinoi s River between May 24, 2006 and Septembe r 5, 2007. Durin g this time, Adams continued to experience symptoms from the leg conditions discu ssed above and also experienced an In light of this finding, the Court does not reach the argume nt4 that Ada ms failed t o pro ve a detrimental effec t of de lay. -11-inguinal her nia. Ada ms w as disch arged from Illino is River ( relea sed from IDOC custody) in early Septembe r 2007, four mon ths ea rlier t han sche duled . Shoe lift. Adams had a shoe lift during this aspec t of his confinement but it was in poor condition. Osafo evaluate d the shoe lift on two occasion s. He initially felt that the lift had deteriorated. He participated in a review with the regional medical director. As a result, Adams was approved for an orthotic device evaluation and was fitted for a new shoe lift. When Adams did not receive a new shoe lift, Osafo informe d him that Wexford would not pay for the new shoe lift. Osafo again evaluate d Adams' shoes in March 200 7 and fo und the shoes to be in goo d shap e. Leg brace. In July 2007, Osafo evalua ted Adams' concerns about the deteriorating condition of his AFO. Osafo decided that the AFO was in disrepair and arranged for membe rs of the prison's maintenance staff to attempt repairs with glue and welding. Those efforts wer e not successful. Osafo advised Adams that a new leg brace would be ordered if the repairs did not work, but Wexford would not pay the cost. Eventually, Osaf o issued a cane for Adams' use. Adams tried the cane but did not find it helpful. Osafo did not arrange for Adams to be fitted for a new AFO. Two mont hs later, Adams was relea sed. At that time, the AFO was held together by a tiny piece of plastic . A few days later, Adams fell on the stree t when the AFO broke apart comp letely. Pain medication. Osafo evaluate d Adams' comp laints of pain and had difficulty determining an objective basis for his symptoms. Osafo tried different pain -12-relief medi cines, inc luding ibupropen, Tylenol, Tylenol with c odeine, and Ne urontin. Special use permits. Osafo evaluate d Adams' ability to perform daily prison functions and did not identify any deficiencies. Osafo personally observe d Adams walk back and forth from his cell to the dining hall using a crutch. Because Osafo felt that Adams was not restri cted, Osafo did not approve a \"slow walk\" pass, but he did grant speci al permi ssion for Ada ms to be a ssigned to a cell close to t he dining hall. Surgery. Aroun d July 2006, Adams suffere d an abdominal injury. Osafo evaluate d Adams' condition between November 2006 and August 2007. Initially, Osafo determined that Adams had a painful inguinal hernia that was small , stable, and not bulgin g. A truss or hernia belt was issued to Adams, and he was advised not to lift heavy objects. This mode of tre atme nt did not work. In July and August 2007, Osafo reevalua ted Adam' s comp laints. By that time, Adams' abdo minal ailment had worsened considerably. The hern ia was very pa inful and had desce nded, enlarged, and was bulgin g in a grote sque manner, creating a disfigu ration. A nurse attempt ed, witho ut success, to \"redu ce\" the hernia using pressure. A warde n was concerned or fright ened by the way the hernia looked. Despite these changes, Osafo stead fastly refused to consider Adams as a candidate for hernia repair surgery. Osafo told Adams that the hernia was reducible, because he was able to push it back in the abdomen with prolon ged effort. He also advised Adams on several occasion s that his employer \"would not pay\" for hernia repair surgery. When Adams was relea sed in Septembe r 2007, the hernia was approxima tely 12 inches wide and protruded severa l inches. Within a few -13-days afte r Adams' re lease, h e underwent e merge ncy hern ia repa ir surger y. A rea sonab le jury co uld not infer from th ese fa cts th at Osafo respon ded to plaintiff's leg length discrepancy with deliberate indifference. Evidence that Osafo allowed Adams to use a shoe lift and a brace that were in disrepair while attempt ing some level of repair, replacement, and alternative use of a cane does not permit the inference of de liberate indifference. But the same cannot be said about Adams' eventual demo nstrat ed need for hernia repair surgery. Construin g the facts and inferences in the light most favor able to Adams, the Court conclude s that a reasona ble jury confronted with this evidence could find that Osafo deliberately or intentionally refused to provi de needed medical servic es. Osafo argue s that Adams is unable to prove that the delay in surgica l repair caused a degre e of harm. It is true that an action based on a delay in the provi sion of medical treatme nt for a painful condition must be suppor ted by verifying medical evidence showing that the condition worsened because of the delay. See Knight v. Wiseman , - F.3d -, 2 009 WL 4912165, *7 (7 Cir. Dec. 22, 2009)(Action for delay in p rovision o fth medical treatment to prisoner \"will not lie unless the plaintiff intro duces verifying medical evidenc e tha t shows his c onditi on worsened b ecause of the delay\"). Accord Grieveson Anderson , 491 F.3d 710, 715 (7th Cir. 20 07). But, as Adams correctly points out, his claim is based on the denial of necessary medical servic es rather than a delay in furnishing medical treatme nt. Verifying -14-medical evidence is not required here, because Adams can show that Osafo refused to provi de a surgica l repair. Evidence that Adams' abdominal ailment was corrected by a different physic ian following his relea se from prison does not convert this from a claim of denial to a clai m of de lay. \u00fe Defendant Wexford Health Sources, Inc. (Wexford) and Defendant Health Professionals, Ltd. (HPL) Defen dants Wexford and HPL seek judgment in their favor on the basis that they did not adopt any policy or custom to refuse medical servic es to inmate s. Delibe rate indifference by the corporate Defen dants may be shown three ways: (1) an expre ss policy that, when enforced, causes a constitutional deprivation; (2) a widesprea d practice that, altho ugh not authorized by writte n law or express municipal policy, is so permanent and well settled as to constitute a custom or usage with the force of law; or (3) an allegati on that the constitutional injury was caused by a person with final policymaking authority.\" Baxter by Baxter v. Vigo County Sch . Corp ., 26 F.3d 72 8, 735 (7th Cir. Defen dants Osafo and Feinerma n have demo nstrat ed that they did not have final policymaking authority when they worked as medical directors. For a period of time, Feinerma n may have had policy makin g authority in a prior position as presiden t/medi cal director of HPL. But there is no correlation between that prior position and the issues in the insta nt case. The evidence regarding Wexford 's policies and customs is conflicting. Osafo and Feinerma n maintain that there were no rules or directives to control costs or restri ct -15-servic es. In 2006, Wexford approved guidelines for the repair of inguinal hernias. Those guidelines provi de that \"urgen t survei llance\" is requi red for he rnias such as the one Adams experienced. The conflicting evidence consists of Osafo's repeated state ments that Wexford would not purchase certain health care services, including hernia repair surgery. Defen dants' argument has merit with respe to HPL. evidence demo nstrat es that HPL had an expre ss policy of medical deliberate indifference, that HPL had a widesprea d practice of medical deliberate indifference, or that a person at HPL with final policymaking authority caused the deprivation at issue. HPL is entitled to summary judgment . By contrast, Adams has presente d some evidence suggesting that Wexford had an expre ss policy and/or customari ly refused to purchase certain health s ervices for inmate s. Adams can show that Defen dant Osafo made such represen tations and that Osafo was knowledge able of Wexford 's policies and customary practices due to his position as medical director. While the evid ence is dispu ted, the Court must resolve the conflic t in Adams' favor in the context of this summary judgment motion. Accordingly, as to the health care servic es vendors, the motion for summary judgment merits grant ing in part (as to HPL) and denial in pa rt (as to Wexford) . D. Conclusion Defen dants' motion for summary judgment (Doc. No. 30) is GRANTED in part and DENIE D in pa rt as follows . -16-The motion is grant ed as to Defendant Feinerman and Defendant HPL on all claims. No genuine issues of fact rema in, and these two Defen dants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. At the close of this case, the Clerk of Court shall enter judgment in favor of Defen dant Feinerma n and Defe ndant We xford and against Plaintiff Adams on all claims. The motion is furth er grant ed as to Defendant Osafo and Defendant Wexford on Adams ' claims relating to the leg ailments. Again , as to these claims, no genuine issues of fact rema in and Defen dants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Thus, at the close of the case, the Clerk o f Court shall en ter judgment in favor of Defen dants Osafo and Wexford and against Plaintiff Adams on the all claims relating to Adams' leg ailment - i.e., on all claims other than the deliberate indifference claims relating to the treatme nt of Adams' he rnia in July and August 2007 . Therefore, the motion is denied only as to Adams' claim of deliberate indifference relating to Dr. Osafo and Wexford 's treatme nt of his serious medical need for hernia repair surgery in July and August 2007. Those claims re main for tri al. Any fut ure plead ings (including the Final Pretrial Order) shall include the style of the case as John K. Adams, Plaintiff, vs. Seth K.
