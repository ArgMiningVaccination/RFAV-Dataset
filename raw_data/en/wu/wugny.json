Its aim is to identify and review the results of good quality health research and to disseminate actively the findings to key decision makers in the NHS and to consumers of health care services. In this way health care professionals and managers can ensur e their practice reflects the best available research evidence. The reviews will cover: the effectiveness of care for particular conditions; the effectiveness of health technologies; and evidence on efficient methods of or ganising and delivering particular types of health care.

Validity assessment 159 vEXECUTIVE SUMMARY Background Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)/ myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) is a debilitating condition characterised by fatigue on minimal exertion accom panied by a range of other symptoms such as headaches, sleep disturbance, cogn itive difficulties and muscle pain. Many different interventions have been used for the treatment, management and rehabilitation of patients with CFS/ME. A systematic review covering all available intervent ions was performed by CRD in 2001, but since that time many new studies have been published and there is a need for the report to be updated. Objective Our objective was to determine whether any particular intervention or combination of interventions is effective in the treatment, management and rehabilit ation of adults and children with a diagnosis of CFS/ME. Methods We searched eleven electronic databases, reference lis ts of articles and reviews, and textbooks on CFS/ME. Additional references we re sought by contact with expe rts. Randomised (RCTs) and non- randomised controlled trials of any intervention or combination of interventi ons were eligible for inclusion. Study participants could be adults or children with a diagnosis of CFS/ME based on any criteria. Decisions on inclusion and assessment of study quality were performed by two reviewers independently. Disagreements were re solved by discussion, with reference to a third reviewer if necessary. Data were extracted fr om study reports by one reviewer and checked by another. Any discrepancies were resolved by reference to the orig inal study, with a third reviewer being consulted if necessary. Only between-group co mparisons were considered. Data were grouped by intervention into pre-specif ied broad categories and synthesised qualitatively. A study was classified as showing some effect (pos itive or negative) of an intervention if any of the outcomes measured showed a significant (p < 0.05 ) difference between the treatment and control groups. Studies were classified as showing an ov erall effect of the intervention if there was a significant difference between the treatment and cont rol groups for more than one clinical outcome. Studies of pre-specified subgroups (children an d those with severe CFS/ME) were considered separately. Results The overall literature search identified 10,768 items, of which 70 met the inclusion criteria for the review. Two studies included in the review by Bagn all et al. were excluded from the updated review, one because it included patients with chronic mononucleosis and one because a full report was subsequently published. Fifteen papers that were ordered as potentially meeting inclusion criteria had not arrived at the time of writing. One paper in the Russian language was identified as potentially meeting inclusion criteria but has not been translat ed. The paper is about a yeast extract supplement but it is unclear whether patients all had CFS. Of the studies included in the review, 59 were RC Ts and the remainder non-randomised controlled trials. Of the newly included studies, 15 showed so me beneficial effect of the intervention and eight showed an overall beneficial effect. Validity scores ranged from 2 to 19 for the included RCTs and from 0 to 14 for the controlled trials. Controlled trials generally scored less well than RCTs on all validity criteria. A high degree of heterogeneity in interventions and outcomes was evident. Behavioural The evidence supporting the effectiveness of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) has been strengthened by one recent good quality RCT in ch ildren and adolescents, which found an overall positive effect of the intervention. CBT was associated with a signi ficant positive effect on fatigue, symptoms, physical functioning and school attendance. Most other new studies of CBT and modified CBT have also favoured the treatment for one or more outcomes but these were either lower quality RCTs or non-randomised studies. Graded exercise t herapy (GET) has recently been studied in two moderate quality RCTs. As with CBT, the overall results of studies to date suggest that GET may have positive effects on the symptoms of CFS/ME and on physical functioning. viImmunological Two new studies of immunological therapies (a controll ed trial of inosine pranobex and a relatively low quality RCT of staphylococcus toxoid) were added to the updated review. Both treatments showed benefits for some outcomes but were also associated wi th relatively high levels of adverse events. Overall there is still insufficient evidence about the effectiveness of therapies of this type. Pharmacological Treatment of CFS/ME with pharmacological therapies has given disappointing results in most cases. A recent large RCT of the acetylcholinestera se inhibitor galantamine hydrobromide found no significant differences between groups. An RCT of hydrocortisone published in 2002 found a significant difference between groups for fatigue, but this study scored poorly for validity. Two other recent studies of steroid treatment found no significant effect, in line with the mixed results reported in 2002. Complementary/alternative The only new study of complement ary/alternative therapies was an RCT of homeopathic treatment that showed significant differences favouring the tr eatment group for one of five measures of fatigue and one of five measures of functional limitations. Supplements A supplement of acetyl-L-carnitine and propionyl-L-ca rnitine showed an overall positive effect in one moderate quality RCT published in 2004. Other supplements (essential fatty acids and magnesium) have also given promising results in single st udies. The evidence base for supplements and miscellaneous interventions for CFS/ME remains very limited. Safety There is limited evidence about adverse effect s associated with behavioural interventions. Withdrawals from treatment in RCT s suggest that there may be an is sue but the evidence is often difficult to interpret because of poor reporting. New studies of behavioural interventions included in the update did not report any withdrawals caused by adv erse events, although again the reasons for withdrawal were often not reported. Several studies of immunological/antiviral, phar macological and nutritional interventions have reported withdrawals because of adverse effects, in cluding recent studies of Staphylococcus toxoid, galanthamine hydrobromide, and hydrocortisone/fludrocortisone. Subgroups Recent studies of CBT and modified CBT in ch ildren and young people both reported that school attendance was significantly better in the treat ment group compared with controls. One study supports the effectiveness of immunoglobulin treatment in children but this intervention may also have harmful effects. There is a lack of new studies ev aluating interventions for patients severely affected by CFS/ME. Conclusions Over the last 5 years, t here has been a marked increase in the size and quality of the evidence base on interventions for CFS/ME. CBT and GET have show n promising results in reducing the symptoms of CFS/ME and improving physical functioning. T here is a need for research to define the characteristics of patients who wo uld benefit from specific interventions and to develop clinically relevant objective outcome measures . 1INTRODUCTION We have undertaken a systematic review to update t he previous review on interventions for the management/ treatment/ rehabilitation of people with CFS/ME.1 This report of the updated review should be read in conjunction with the origi nal CRD Report 22, which provides background information on the condition, interventions and out comes and a fuller discussion of studies published up to 2001. The project was funded by the Nati onal Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), which commissioned the National Collaborating Centre for Primary Care (part of the Royal College of General Practitioners) to produce guidelines for 'The diagnosis and management of chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (or encephalopat hy) in adults and children'. The review formed part of the independent synthesis of research evidence to suppo rt the development of these guidelines. The views expressed in this report ar e those of the authors and not necessarily those of the NCC-PC, RCGP or NICE. Review question Does the evidence show that any particular interventi on or combination of interventions is effective in treatment, management or rehabilitation of adults and children with a diagnosis of CFS/ME? Review methods Literature search The literature search was updated form 2001 to 2005. The search was broad and not restricted by intervention or outcome. The search aimed to pick up all studies of CFS/ME and related synonyms. Individual search strategies were developed for eac h electronic database searched. The following databases were searc hed: MEDLINE (1966 to May 2005), EMBASE (1980 to May 2005), PSYCINFO (1887 to May 2005), CCTR (March 2005), Social Science Citation Index (1981-2005), Science Citation Index (1981-2005), Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings (1982-2005), PASCAL (1973-2005), MANTIS (1880 - January 2005), JICST (1985 - 2005), Conference Proceedings Index (1973 - January 2005), AMED (1984 - January 2005). The full search strategies are listed in Appendix 1. Via the NICE Guideline Development Group (GDG) consultation process, we attempted to make contact with individuals who are experts in the fi eld to identify any unpublished literature or ongoing studies. The bibliographies of included studies were also scanned for any additional references. Study selection Two reviewers independently assessed all titles and abstracts identified from the searches of electronic databases for potential rele vance to the review question. Al l papers that looked potentially relevant were retrieved in full. Two reviewers in dependently assessed all retrieved studies for possible inclusion, using the inclusion criteria listed below . The use of two reviewers is a method which is commonly employed in systematic reviews, to minimise the risk of introducing bias to the results of the review. If the two reviewers cannot agree, a third reviewer is consulted to resolve the differences. Inclusion criteria Intervention - any intervention or combination of interv entions used in the treatment, management or rehabilitation of people with CFS/ME Population - adults or children aged 5 years or more with a diagnosis of CFS/ME based on any criteria Outcomes - all outcomes reported in included studies were considered. Study design - only randomised or controlled c linical trials were included. Data extraction, validity assessment and data synthesis For all review questions, data were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Discrepancies were resolved by referral to the orig inal studies. If necessary, ar bitration was by a third 2reviewer. Duplicate publications were actively screened for and where found the latest or most complete report was used. The following categories of data were extracted: st udy author; year of publication; country study was carried out in; number of study participants; parti cipant details paying particular attention to the following - inclusion/ exclusion criteria (if any), information relating to subgroups (age/ severity) if reported, baseline functioning and diagnostic criteria used; setting; study design; level of evidence; intervention details (according to whether the inte rvention is pharmacological or non-pharmacological e.g. drug dose, frequency, duration, content, persons delivering the intervention, setting of intervention (e.g. Group or Individual CBT), co-int erventions); comparators (if any, details as for interventions); outcomes measured; results. Validity assessment was carried out, using an exis ting validity assessment tool, by two reviewers independently, using predefined criteria. Discrepan cies were resolved by discussion or, when agreement could not be reached, by consultation with a third reviewer. The information was tabulated and summarised narrati vely, grouped by intervention. Interventions were broadly grouped into the following categories: pharmacological immunological behavioural (including graded exercise, grade d activity, pacing, CBT, psychotherapy, counselling, family therapy, rehabilitation) complementary other (e.g. multicomponent interventions tailo red to symptoms of the individual; buddy programmes, dietary) supplements In evaluating the effects of intervent ions, a study was classified as showing some effect of treatment if any of the outcomes measured showed a significant (p < 0.05) difference between the treatment and control groups. Studies were classified as showi ng an overall effect of treatment if there was a significant difference between the treatment and cont rol groups for more than one clinical outcome. Information from stronger study de signs (with higher validity scores) was emphasised. In addition, where information was presented regarding subgroups (children or severely affected) this was summarised separately. The homogeneity/heterogeneity in terms of parti cipants, interventions and outcomes in included studies was assessed in a qualitative manner based on the judgment of the reviewers. 3RESULTS Seventy trials are included in this section. Deta iled data extraction and validity assessment tables are presented in Appendix 2 and 3. Additionally, four ongoi ng trials that have not yet been published were identified.2-5 Fifteen papers that were ordered as potentially meeting inclusion criteria had not arrived at the time of writing this report.6-20 One paper in the Russian language wa s identified as potentially meeting inclusion criteria but has not been translated.21 The paper is about a yeast extract supplement but it is unclear whether patients all had CFS. No RCTs, controlled trials, or good quality cohort studies, case-control studies before-and-after studies or interrupted time series were found for the following treatments which the GDG had identified a priori as being of interest: ent programme; amitripty line; gabapentin; injections. relating to adults with CFS/ME Main results of behavioural treatment trials (Table 1) CBT, given in weekly or biweekly sessions with the aim to increase activity and reduce rest time in a systematic manner, independent of symptoms, was evaluat ed in adults in four RCTs.22-26 A controlled trial of \"modified CBT\" used a different form of tr eatment without graded activity, which is normally considered an integral part of CBT for CFS/ME. The intervention used in this study aimed to promote shared coping through relaxation training and guid ed imagery, cognitive therapy techniques and behavioural prescription involving activity limitations.27 Other types of modified CBT, with occupational therapy/rehabilitation as pects, were examined in another RCT28 and two controlled trials.29, 30 All studies included people diagnosed with CFS according to one of the recognised case definitions, except one which included people with post viral fatigue syndrome.31 CBT was compared to routine medical care in two RCTs,25, 28 and two controlled trials,29, 30 to relaxation in one RCT,22, 23 to natural course (control) in another RCT,26 and to guided support in one controlled trial of \"modified CBT\".27 A further RCT compared CBT plus placebo inject ions to CBT plus leukocyte extract, a control clinic plus leukocyte extract and to a co ntrol clinic plus placebo injections.24 The RCT which investigated the effects of both l eukocyte extract and CBT showed a significantly greater effect on general health in the group receiv ing both leukocyte extract and CBT compared to the other groups. No differences were found between groups (including CBT alone) for the other outcomes investigated.24 The controlled trial of modified CBT found no difference between intervention and control groups for fa tigue, depression or symptom scores.27 This study scored very poorly on the validity assessment, scoring only 1 out of a possible 20. The remaining three RCTs reported a beneficial e ffect of CBT when compared to controls.22, 25, 26 All three RCTs found a significant short term impr ovement in physical functioning, fatigue, and global improvement, but neither of the two studies that assessed depression found any differences between groups.22, 25 One of these RCTs also followed patient s for five years after the intervention. At the five year follow-up assessment global improvement was greater in the intervent ion group, as was the proportion of participants who completely recovered,23 however, no differences were reported between the groups in terms of physical functioning, fatigue, general health, symptoms, relapses or the proportion of participants that no longer met the UK criteria for CFS. The three studies of modified CBT with rehabilitation 28-30 found significant differences between groups for symptoms (one RCT, one controlled trial), emoti onal distress (one controlled trial) and global health/ quality of life (3 controlled trials). In one RCT two participants dropped out of the CBT group because they felt a deterioration in their symptoms was due to the intervention. 25 A second RCT showed very high drop out rates of between 20 and 40% in all three treatment groups.26 Drop out rates were highest in the CBT group and lowest in the control group, reasons fo r drop-outs were not stated and no adverse effects from treatment were reported. 4The effects of graded exercise therapy (GET) were in vestigated in five fairly large RCTs of patients with CFS, all of which found significant improvem ents in the intervention compared to the control groups. Improvements in measures of fatigue and physical function were found in all five RCTs.32-36 Two also showed improvement in general health32, 34 and one in physiological measurements and symptoms.33 When exercise was combined with fluoxetine there was no additional effect.33 One RCT assessed different interventions to encourage graded exercise and found benefits of GET compared to standardised medical care for all outcomes inve stigated. However, there were no differences between the different intervention groups for any of the outcomes investigated. 34, 37 In one of the RCTs evaluating GET, one participant dropped out from each group due to worsening of symptoms.32 In another RCT of exercise (and exercise plus fluoxetine), 11 participants dropped out due to side effects but it is unclear which intervention group they were in.33 5Table 1 Results of behavioural treatment trials in adults Results in bold indicate statistically significant differences between treatment groups (p<0.05) Results Intervention Author (Year), number of participants Resource use Physical Psychological Physiological Quality of life and general health Drop-outs/Adverse effects Validity score Deale (1997)22 n=60 Physical functioning and fatigue (assessor and patient rating): greater improvement in treatment than control (p<0.01) Depression: No significant differences in change between groups Work and social adjustment, long term goals, self-rating of global improvement, patient satisfaction with treatment outcome and proportion employed: greater improvement in treatment than control (p<0.05) General health questionnaire, patient assessment of usefulness of treatment: no significant differenc es in change between groups Results at 5 year follow-up 23 n=53 Physical functioning and fatigue: no significant difference between two groups Global improvement and proportion completely recovered: greater improvement in treatment than control (p<0.001) General health and proportion that no longer meet UK CFS criteria: no significant differe nces between groups Symptoms and relapses: suggestion of greater improvement in treatment than control (p=0.05) 7 dropped out, 3 from CBT, no adverse effects reported 18 Lloyd (1993)24 n=49 Physical capacity & functional measure : no significant differences between groups Mood : no significant differences between groups Immune outcomes : no significant differences between groups General health : group in which DLE combined with CBT showed greater improvement than other intervention groups (p<0.05) 2 participants dropped, however, no participants dropped out due to adverse effects 13 Sharpe (1998)25 n=60 Physical functioning, interference with activities, number of days in bed, exercise and fatigue: greater improvement in treatment than control (p<0.05) Depression and anxiety: no significant differences between groups (p>0.05) Improvement in work status, global improvement: greater improvement in treatment than control (p<0.001) Illness beliefs: greater proportion of patients in treatment group reported reduction in strength of illness beliefs (p<0.05).

One RCT found greater improvements in the intervention group on symptom scores and functional capacity but not in depression, immune outcomes or quality of life.39 A second smaller RCT found improved immune measurements (physiological outcome) but not functional or symptom measures.40 A t h i r d R C T , which was the largest in the immunoglobulin cat egory, found no improvement in any of the outcomes investigated (functional status, mood, immune outcomes and quality of life).41 Other immunomodulators were investigated in four RCTs , all of which included participants with CFS. Two of these evaluated interferon, one of which su ggested some positive effect. In one very small RCT, treatment led to increased physical activity and recovery which remained after 8 months follow- up, however it is not r eported whether this was st atistically significant.42 In the other RCT, alpha- interferon led to an improvement in immune measurem ents (one outcome) but not in quality of life measurements.43 The effects of ampligen were investigated in one relatively large (n=92) RCT, which found an improvement in functional ability, activi ty, exercise, cognitive function and work measures but not in depression scores.44 In the same RCT, elective use of other medications by participants was reported to have increased significantly in the pl acebo group compared to the intervention group. One RCT assessed the combined effect of leukocyt e extract and cognitive behavioural therapy using a factorial design.24 A significant improvement in general health was reported for the group which received both interventions, compared to the other groups. No beneficial effects were reported for physical and functional capacity, mood or immune ou tcomes for any of the groups in this study. The effect of acyclovir, an antiviral , was investigated in one small RCT in those who fulfilled criteria for CFS and additionally had prior infection with Epstein Barr virus confirmed.45 A significant negative effect was reported for anxiety, depression and conf usion with the control group showing a greater improvement in symptoms than the treatment group, but not for the other outcomes investigated (rest, anger, vigour, fatigue, oral temperature and personal well-being). A very small trial of gancyclovir (n=11) found no beneficial effects, and the trial had to be stopped early due to bleeding during invasive investigations.46 A small trial of inosine pranobex (n=16) found significant improvements in immune function in the treatment group, but no di fferences between groups for other outcomes (symptoms, cognitive function, global severity, activity).47 One RCT of patients with CFS evalua ted the antihistamine terfenadine. 48 This study found no differences between the groups for any of the out comes investigated (functional status and symptoms). The effects of vaccination with staphylococcus toxoid were investigated in one small controlled trial of patients with CFS49 and one fairly large RCT.50 In the controlled trial, no differences were reported in depression, pain or psychological outcomes between the intervention and control group. However, a greater improvement in the clinical global impres sion in the treatment gr oup was found. In the RCT, the treatment group had a significantly better outco me than the control group for global impression and one item on the fibromyalgia impact questionnaire. Some severe adverse effects were noted in partic ipants in the immunological intervention groups. Three people had to withdraw from acyclovir treatment due to reversible renal failure45 and two people from immunoglobulin treatment due to severe constitutional symptom reactions.41 One recipient of immunoglobulin therapy also withdrew due to mild but transient liver failure39 and phlebitis has also been noted with immunoglobulin infusions.39 Transient elevation of serum uric acid was noted in the trial of inosine pranobex.47 In the RCT of staphylococcus toxo id, 13 patients in the treatment group and 7 in the placebo group experienced side effects.50 It should be noted that immunoglobulins and leukocyte extract are blood products. There ar e known risks associated with the use of blood products such as the possible transfer of infectious diseases. 9Table 2 Results of immunol ogical treatment trials Results in bold indicate statistically significant differences between treatment groups (p<0.05) Results Intervention Author (Year), number of participants Resource Use Physical Psychological Physiological Quality of life and general health Drop-outs/Adverse effects Validity score Antihistamine Terfenadine Steinberg (1996)48 n=30 Functional : no significant differences between groups Symptoms : no significant differences between groups 1 participant from each group withdrew due to non-improvement 12 Acyclovir Straus (1988)45 n=27 Rest: no significant differences between groups Mood : greater improvement in control group for anxiety, depression and confusion (p<0.05).

No benefit was found in patients with CFS from treatment with anticholinergic agents,51-53 antidepressants (either in treating symptoms of depression or any of the other outcome measures reported)33, 54, 55 or growth hormone.56 However some studies reported a positive effect on individual outcomes. Oral NADH led to a greater improvement in sy mptoms (the only outcome investigated) in the intervention group compared to the control group in one small RCT,57 but no significant difference in symptoms in another low quality RCT.58 A trial of melatonin versus phototherapy found significant improvements in sleep, vitality and mental health, but worsening of bodily pain in the melatonin group.59 The effects of steroid treatment were investigated in seven RCTs of participants with CFS. Three of these RCTs evaluated hydrocortisone.60-62 One found an improvement, of borderline statistical significance, in general health but not in ac tivity, depression, mood or symptom measures.60 T h e second smaller RCT found improvements in clin ical global impression, fatigue, symptoms and disability, although the improvement in disability was not significant.61 The third found improvement in fatigue and hormone levels.62 Two RCTs assessed fludrocortisone, and did not find any association between treatment and the outcomes investigated.63,64 One RCT of fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone combined found no significant benefit of treatment65 and a seventh RCT of topical nasal corticosteroids also found no effect of treatment.66 One RCT and one controlled trial investigated the effect of monoamine oxidase inhibitors in participants with CFS. 67, 68 The RCT evaluated moclobemide, and found no benefit of treatment.67 The small controlled trial of selegiline was associat ed with greater improvement in tension, anxiety and vigour in the intervention group compared to the control group, but not wi th functional capacity, fatigue, illness severity or symptom measures.68 A trial of dexamphetamine found significant impr ovements in fatigue in the treated group. 69 Reduced food consumption was a side effect in this group. One very small RCT (n=10) evaluated the effects of the antihypertensive drug clonidine and found no significant effect on cognitive function.70 Adverse events serious enough to cause people to withdraw from the study occurred with galanthamine hydrobromide,51, 52 phenelzine54, fludrocortisone64 and fluoxetine.55 13Table 3 Results of pharmacological treatment trials Results in boldindicate statistically significant differences between treatment groups (p<0.05) Results Intervention Author (Year), number of participants Resource Use Physical Psychological Physiological Quality of life and general health Drop-outs/ Adverse effects Validity score Pharmacological Galanthamine hydrobromide Snorrason (1996)51 n=49 Sleep disturbance, fatigue, myalgia: no significant differences between groups Cognitive function: no significant differences between groups Work capacity/satisfac tion: no significant differences between groups5 participants, 3 on treatment, 2 on placebo dropped out. 1 participant dropped out due to dizziness, 1 due to headaches.

This st udy also scored poorly on the validity assessment (6 out of 20). The other, high quality RCT reported significant improvements in one of five measures of fatigue and on some physical dimensions of the functional limitations profile in the treatment group.72 No adverse effects were reported in either group. Massage therapy improved measures of fatigue, pai n and sleep, depression and cortisol levels in one small RCT in those diagnosed with chroni c fatigue immune deficiency syndrome (CFIDS).73 Osteopathy also reportedly improved measures of fa tigue, back pain and sleep, anxiety and cognitive function and general health in a controlled trial of pati ents diagnosed with ME. However, the quality of this study was poor (score = 0 out of 20).74 18Table 4 Results of alternative therapy (homeopathy) treatment trial Results in bold indicate statistically significant differences between treatment groups (p<0.05) Results Intervention Author (Year), number of participants Resource Use Physical Psychological Physiological Quality of life and general health Drop-outs/Adverse effects Validity score Alternative Awdry (1996)71 n=64 Greater improvement with treatment than in control group (no figures presented) 3 participants dropped out, 2 in homeopathy group, however, no participants dropped out due to adverse effects 6 Homeopathy Any homeopathic remedy Weatherley- Jones (2004)72 n=103 Fatigue, functional limitations: significant differences in favour of treatment group for fatigue (p=0.04) and some physical dimensions of the Functional Limitations Profile (p value not reported) 11 withdrew from treatment arm (5 did not complete treatment) and 8 from placebo arm (6 did not complete treatment) 17 Massage therapy Field (1997)73 n=20 Fatigue, Pain and sleep: greater improvement in intervention group compared to control (p<0.05) Depression: greater improvement in treatment group compared to control(p<0.005) Laboratory measures: no difference in levels of norepinephrine or epinephrine, significant decrease in cortisol levels in treatment group (p<0.01) Not stated 9 Osteopathy Perrin (1998)74 n=58 Fatigue, back pain, sleep: greater improvement in intervention group compared to control (p value not reported) Depression : no difference between groups Anxiety and cognitive function: greater improvement in treatment group compared to control (p value not reported) General health and Nottingham health questionnaire : greater improvement in treatment group compared to control (p value not reported) 2 drop outs in treatment group, 17 in control, reasons for drop-outs not stated 0 (NB controlled trial) 19Main results of supplement treatment trials (Table 5) Two studies investigated the effect of essential fatty acid supplements. One RCT in patients with CFS found some non-significant improvement as perceived by the participant s, as well as non-significant improvements in depression, but not in general symptoms.75 A slightly larger RCT investigated the effect of essential fatty acid supplements in those diagnosed with post viral fatigue syndrome (PVFS).31 Improvement (as perceived by the participa nts) was reported in the intervention group, along with an improvement in symptoms and a greater shift towards normal levels of cell fatty acid concentration. Magnesium supplements led to improvements in measur es of energy and pain, emotional reactions, general health and laboratory measures but not in sl eep, physical mobility or social isolation in one small RCT of patients with CFS. 76 One very small RCT assessed the effects of liver extract in patients with CFS but found no difference in outco mes between the intervention and control groups.77 General supplements had no effect in two RCTs and one controlled trial of patients with CFS.78-80 These studies also scored poorly on the validity assessment (6-10 out of 20). RCTs of pollen extract81 and medicinal mushrooms82 reported no significant effects of treatment. A RCT of acclydine and amino acids83 reported significantly more improvement in IGF-1 levels in the intervention than control group, but no significant di fference in global improvement or symptoms. A RCT of acetyl-L-carnitine and propionyl-L-carniti ne found significant improvements in fatigue and cognitive function associ ated with treatment.84 Reasons for dropping out of the studi es were not well described in the supplement trials, however in the magnesium trial, two participants left the intervention group after experiencing a generalised rash.76 20Table 5 Results of supplement treatment trials Results in bold indicate statistically significant differences between treatment groups (p<0.05) Results Intervention Author (Year), number of participants Resource Use Physical Psychological Physiological Quality of life and general health Drop-outs/Adverse effects Validity score Warren (1999)75 n=50 Depression : trend for treatment group to show greater improvement (p=0.09) Symptom measure : no significant differences between groups Participant assessment of improvement: trend for greater improvement in treatment group (p=0.09) 2 in treatment group dropped out before trial started, 5 in each group withdrew during trial, felt that they were not getting any better 16 Essential fatty acids (36mg gamma-linoleic acid E.)

This study also scored very poorly on the validity assessment, receiv ing a score of three out of a possible 20 and so these results should be interpreted with caution. A controlled trial of 'broad-based management' (mai nly information and advice) in people diagnosed with post-infectious fatigue syndrome found signific ant improvements in the intervention group in measurements of fatigue, somatic symptoms and self-efficacy.86 Again, a low score on validity assessment (two points out of 20) indicates that these results should be treated with caution. A very small controlled trial of a buddy/mentor pr ogramme found significant improvements in the treatment group compared to control for fatigue se verity but not for any of the other six outcomes investigated.87 A trial of 'group therapy', which was not well descr ibed, found no significant effects of treatment. 88 An unpublished trial of a low sugar, low yeast diet, compared to healthy eating, also found no significant effect of treatment. 89 A RCT of multiple symptom-based treatments (inc luding supplements) found significant improvements in favour of the treatment group in symptoms sc ores, overall response and fibromyalgia-specific symptoms.90 This trial scored 19 points out of a pos sible 20 in the validity assessment. 23Table 6: Other treatment trials Results in bold indicate statistically significant differences between treatment groups (p<0.05) Results Intervention Author (Year), number of participants Resource Use Physical Psychological Physiological Quality of life and general health Drop-outs/Adverse effects Validity score Combination multitreatment Marlin (1998)85 n=71 Employment status : Greater number of participants returned to work in treatment group (significance not reported) 49/71 were not followed up.

The study reported no differences in response to fludrocortisone between the two groups.64 A controlled trial of broad-based management also found no differences in response between those who had been ill for shorter and longer periods of time.86 In the same study, participants were also grouped acco rding to degree of initial functional impairment, emotional distress, and fatigue. No differences in response were seen in those with a greater degree of initial functional impairment and emotional distress , however those who reported more initial fatigue showed greater improvements in self-efficacy scores (p=0.04).86 One study of rehabilitation treatment for i npatients found some benefits of treatment.30 Patients with high fatigue and disability scores were included in an RCT of a general supplement, but no significant treatment effects were seen.79 The inclusion criteria for the tria l of pollen extract state that only relatively serious cases were included.81 Very limited numbers of studies considered subgroup s of patients. For ex ample, no studies were found that compared the effects of treatment in bed and wheelchair bound patients with those who were less restricted by their illnes s, or that assessed whether treatment had different effects in those where the diagnosis had been made using criteria for CFS compared with those where the diagnosis had been made using criteria for ME. It was unclea r in many trials how severely affected the participants were. Evidence relating to children One RCT of immunoglobulin G included only children.91 A significant improvement in functional score (based on attempts and attendance at school or work and physical or social activities) was reported in the intervention group compared to the control group. Significantly more children in the intervention group had an improvement in score of 25% or more. A second RCT of immunoglobulin included both adults and children according to standard definiti ons, although no participants under the age of 16 were included.41 No significant improvements were se en in symptom scores and in functional capacity in the intervention group compared to the c ontrol group. The findings from both of these studies have also been presented in the main immu nological section. The use of blood products such as immunoglobulin is associated with known risks and so the use of this treatment should be carefully considered. One controlled trial of r ehabilitation/CBT in childre n reported significant impr ovements in the treatment group for measures of global wellness. 92 One RCT of CBT in children reported significant improvements in symptoms and attendance at school.93 In both, the intervention was compared to routine care. No evaluations of other interventions in vestigated in children were identified . 25Table 7 Treatment trials in children Results in bold indicate statistically significant differences between treatment groups (p<0.05) Intervention Results Author (Year), number of participants Resource Use Physical Psychological Physiologic al Quality of life and general health Drop-outs/Adverse effects Validity score CBT Stulemeijer (2004)93 n=69 Physical functioning, fatigue, symptoms: significant difference in favour of CBT group (p<0.003) School attendance: significant difference in favour of treatment group (p=0.04) 6 patients dropped out during treatment. 7 were missing from CBT group and 2 from control group at final assessment 16 Modified CBT Viner (2004)92 CFS severity: better result in intervention group, significance not reported Global wellness, school attendance: significantly better in treatment group (p<0.05) No withdrawals 2 (NB controlled trial) Immuno- globulin Rowe (1997)91 n=71 Functional : greater improvement in number improved and change in functional score in treatment group (p<0.04) No participants dropped out due to adverse effects, one participant in the placebo group moved away and so was withdrawn from the study 16 26Validity of included studies Most RCTs scored well on the objectivity and validit y of outcomes, blinding of investigators and participants, baseline comparability of groups, comple teness of follow-up and appropriate statistical analysis (Appendix 3). RCTs generally scored poorly on the concealment of treatment allocation and many failed to use an intention to treat analysis. Co ntrolled trials scored less well on the objectivity and validity of outcomes and on all other validity criter ia. Two of the eight controlled trials in which groups were not comparable at baseline did adjust for baseline differences or confounding factors. Only one of the controlled trials used a sample size calculation. No one intervention type scored more highly on the validity criteria than any other. Summary of results The results of each trial, ranked according to valid ity score, are presented in Table 8. Where studies presented their findings as within group differences rather than as differences between the intervention and control group, thes e results are presented but shoul d be treated with caution. The findings from each study should be consid ered alongside the methodological quality. Of the 70 included trials 36 (51%) showed some benefic ial effect of the intervention and 20 of these (29%) showed an overall beneficial effect, one study repo rted a negative effect of the intervention. Overall, of those studies that found some beneficial effect of the intervention, three studies (two of immunological interventions and one of supplemen ts) found a benefit for physiological outcome measurements only. Some studies investigated a large number of outcomes - the range across studies was from 1 to 15 - making it possible that any statistically signific ant differences could have arisen by chance. The results of those studies evaluating multiple outcomes should therefore be treated with caution. Behavioural In the behavioural category, cognitive behaviour al therapy showed positive results. Four22 259493 of the five RCTs evaluating CBT found a positive overall e ffect of the intervention and these studies also scored highly on validity assessment. One RCT which also included immunologic therapy24 and one RCT38 and two controlled trials of modified CBT,27, 92 did not find overall beneficial effects of CBT. These studies also scored lower on the validity assessment, especially one of the controlled trials which scored 1 out of a possible 20. Two studies ( one RCT, one controlled trial) of rehabilitation, including CBT, showed a positive overall effect28, 30 but scored less than 50% on validity assessment. An overall beneficial effect was also found in two controlled trials of two different multi-treatment approaches, one of which included CBT85 and one of which was based on providing information and advice.86 However, the methodological quality of both t hese studies was very poor. A controlled trial of a buddy/mentor programme found a beneficial effect for one of the seven outcomes investigated; this study scored poorly on the validity a ssessment and only included 12 participants.87 Graded exercise therapy (GET) al so showed promising results: f our of five RCTs found an overall beneficial effect of the intervention compared to t he control groups. Two of these RCTs scored highly in the validity assessment, (scoring 17 out of a possible 20).32, 34 Immunological In the immunological category two small RCTs eval uated interferon; one of these found no beneficial effect42 and the other showed some positive effects although this was in relation to physiological outcomes only.43 The methodological quality of both these studies was fairly poor; scoring 6 and 11 respectively, out of a possible 20 on the validity a ssessment. Four RCTs assessed the effects of immunoglobulin in patients with CFS; of t hese one showed an overall beneficial effect,91 one showed some positive effects39, and two found no effect.40, 41 All four of these RCTs scored reasonably well on the validity assessment, achieving scores of between 13 and 16 out of 20. Immunoglobulin is a blood product and so there is a risk of the possible transfer of, for example, infectious diseases. One immunological RCT of ampligen found an overall beneficial effect,44 and a positive effect was found in one small controlled trial of staphylococcus toxoid49 and one larger RCT.50 A small RCT of the antihistamine oral terfenadine reported no beneficial effects.48 These four studies scored between 9 and 14 on the validity assessment. 27A small RCT of acyclovir reported a greater improv ement in anxiety, depression and confusion in the control group compared to the treatment group, ho wever, no differences in treatment effect were found for the other six outcomes investigated.45 This study scored 15 out of 20 on the validity assessment. Small RCTs of gancyclovir46 and inosine pranobex47 showed no effect of treatment and a positive effect on laboratory outcomes, respectively. Pharmacological In the pharmacological category two RCTs of fludroc ortisone reported no effect of treatment. These studies were of reasonable quality.63, 64 Some beneficial effects of hydrocortisone were found in two RCTs.61, 62 One of these studies scored highly on the validit y assessment with a score of 18 out of 20, the other was of poor quality with a validit y score of 2. Trials of anti-depressants53-55, 67 reported no effects of treatment either on symptoms of depres sion or on any of the other outcome measures reported. One poor quality RCT showed an overall beneficial effect of oral NADH 57 and another of lower quality showed no effect.58 A poor quality RCT of melatonin59 reported an overall positive effect of treatment. One controlled trial of selegiline reported some po sitive effects of treatment but found no overall effect.68 Alternative / complementary Homeopathic therapies were evaluated in two RCTs, one of poor quality71 and one of good quality.72 Some positive effects of homeopathy were seen in t he better quality trial. One controlled trial of osteopathy found some non-significant improvements in the intervention group, but the values were estimated from graphs and so the results may not be entirely accurate.74 This study scored very poorly on the validity assessment, scoring 0. A poor quality study of massage therapy found an overall positive effect.73 Supplements In the supplements category one good quality RCT of essential fatty acids reported no beneficial effects of the intervention75 and one found an overall beneficial effect.31 Magnesium supplements were found to have an overall beneficial effect in the one good quality RCT where these were evaluated, but this result has never been replicated.76 Three fairly poor quality trials evaluated general supplements, but none found a positive effect.78-80 Poor quality RCTs of liver extract,77 pollen extract81 and medicinal mushrooms82 also reported no beneficial effects. A poor quality RCT of acetyl-L-carnitine84 reported overall beneficial effects, and a poor quality trial of acclydine and amino acids reported benefi cial effects in physiological measures.83 Other Two controlled trials85, 86 and one high quality RCT90 of combined treatments showed mixed results, only the RCT reporting overall beneficial effects of treatment. A small controlled trial of a buddy/ mentor programme showed some positive effects.87 It must be noted for most of the interventi ons the results are based on one or two studies, which may limit the generalisability of the fi ndings. Another factor which may limit the applicability of the findings is the inclusion crit eria specified in some trials. For example, in some studies participants were only eligible if they could physically get to the clinic, which implies a certain level of fitness. Those people who were unable to walk or to get out of bed were automatically excluded and so it is not possible to assess whether the interventions investigated would be effective, ineffective or even hazardous for a more severely disabled group of people. However, in many of the trials very limited information was given about participants who were ineligible or indeed a bout the baseline functioning on many of those who were included. Therefore, it is difficult to extrapolate how the findings might transfer to other people with CFS and/or ME. 28Table 8: Summary of study results Treatment Number of patients Outcomes investigated Any effect Overall effect Validity score (Maximum 20) BEHAVIOURAL CBT22 60 PH; PS; QOL + 15 QOL + 9 GET36 61 PS; PH: LAB + + 9 Rehab28 9 <> <> 5 Melatonin59 30 PH; PS + 5 nasal corticosteroids66 28 PH <> <> 3 PH; LAB <> 2 ALTERNATIVE Homeopathy72 PH + <> 17 Massage therapy73 20 PH; PS; LAB and amino acids83 90 PH; <> 3 Medicinal mushrooms82 70 PH <> <> 3 OTHER Combination90 72 PH + + 19 Low sugar low yeast diet89 57 PH; QOL <> 1 + indicates a positive effect of treatment; indicates a negative effect of treatment; <> indicates no effect of treatment *Essential fatty = 255mg linol eic acid (LA), plus 10 IU vitamin E.

Outcomes which showed a significant difference between intervention and control groups are highlighted in bold Controlled studies are shaded in the table, all other studies are RCTs. 30 31DISCUSSION Methodological quality of included studies There are now a considerable number of studies evaluating interventions for the treatment and management of CFS/ME and many of them have used robust research methods; the majority of the included studies were RCTs and many of these we re of high methodological quality (Table 8). However, RCTs generally scored poorly for concealme nt of treatment allocation and many failed to use an intention-to-treat analysis. These issues shou ld be addressed in designing future clinical trials of interventions for CFS/ME. Outcomes A fundamental problem in evaluating interventions fo r CFS/ME is that the wide variety of outcome measures used in the included studies makes it difficult to compare the effects of interventions across studies. Even when studies evaluated the same outcome , they used a variety of scales and measures to do so. This heterogeneity made it impossible to combine studies by meta-analysis. We have summarised our results (Table 8) in a way designed to convey as much information as possible in a relatively small space, but this presentation has limitations. Achievem ent of statistically significant differences between groups may be influenced by sample size and results may be statistically but not clinically significant. Our measure of 'overall effect' represents an attempt to deal with this issue by showing which studies reported a statistically signif icant treatment effect on two or more clinical outcomes. Interventions Although we have discussed all the studies evaluating a particular intervention together, the treatment offered to patients receiving a particular type of therapy in practice may vary c onsiderably, particularly for behavioural interventions. For example, in the CBT study by Stulemeijer et al.93, participants in the intervention group received ten individual therapy sessions over 5 months in a hospital child psychology department, whereas in the study by Whitehead et al.95 the intervention was a form of 'brief CBT' delivered by general practitioners. Further standardisa tion of methods for delivering behavioural interventions in research and practice would be desirable. Participants in included studies and diagnostic criteria The studies included in our review also show a lack of uniformity in terms of case definitions for CFS/ME, study inclusion and exclusion criteria and the basic information provided about the participants. For example, baseline functional status and duration of illness are not always reported. This makes it difficult to asse ss the generalisability of the findi ngs of many of these studies. Withdrawals and drop-outs Some studies of behavioural interventions have r eported significant rates of withdrawal from treatment or loss to follow-up, as high as 20-40% in some studies9596. This update did not find any new evidence of adverse effects (sufficient to caus e withdrawal from treatm ent) associated with GET or CBT. However, reasons for withdrawals were o ften poorly reported and should be investigated in more detail in future studies. The new studies inclu ded in the update confirmed previous reports of withdrawals because of adv erse events associated with immunol ogical/antiviral and pharmacological interventions. Duration of follow-up There remains a lack of long-term follow-up data for most interventions, although a 5-year follow-up of the RCT of CBT by Deale and colleagues showed main tained benefit of the intervention for several outcomes23 and a 2-year follow-up of one RCT of GET was published in 2004.34 Children The pre-specified subgroups investigated in this update were children and adolescents and those severely affected by CFS/ME. Guidelines for t he management of CFS/ME were published by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health in 2004.97 The recommendations were largely developed by consensus because of a lack of spec ific evidence for this age group. GET and CBT were recommended for consideration based on extrapol ation from studies in adults. The effectiveness of CBT for adolescents is support ed by a recent high-quality RCT,93 although this had only 69 participants. 32Patients with severe CFS/ME There remains a lack of studies evaluating the effe ctiveness of interventions for patients severely affected by CFS/ME. The protocols for many clinical studies require patients to attend a clinic for treatment and/or assessment. These conditions ma y exclude people severely affected with CFS/ME from taking part. The balance between effectiv eness and adverse effects of interventions may be different in more severely affected compared with less severely affected patients and methods of delivery/doses may need to be different. Research to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for severely affected patients should be considered a priority. Combination therapy No new studies of combination therapy were added to the updated review. Given that it is likely that many patients with CFS/ME have tr ied a number of different interventions, this remains a notable gap in the research literature. 33CONCLUSIONS A total of 70 trials investigated the effectiveness of seven different categories of intervention: behavioural, immunological, antiviral, pharmaco logical, supplements, complementary/ alternative and other. Overall the interventions demonstrated mix ed results in terms of effectiveness. All conclusions about effectiveness should be considered together with the methodological inadequacies in some of the studies. Interventions which have shown evidence of effectiveness include CBT and GET. There is insufficient evidence about how sub-gr oups of patients may respond differently to treatments and further studies investi gating additional subgroups are needed. In some of the included studies bed or wh eelchair restricted patient s and children have been excluded, which raises questions about the applicability of findings to all people with CFS/ME. CBT and immunoglobulin G are the only intervent ions which have been investigated in young people. There is insufficient evidence for additive or combined effects of interventions where more than one therapy is used. Future research could usefully compare CBT and GET and there is a need to evaluate the effectiveness of pacing, ideally in comparison to CBT and GET. Future research needs to combine scien tific rigour with patient acceptability. The large number of outcome measures used makes standardisation of outcomes a priority for future research. 34 35REFERENCES 1. Bagnall A-M, Whiting P, Wright K, Sowden AJ.
