Starting out in nursing, Dr. Aurore's life path was changed drastically by her own debilitating illnesses and diagnosis of her first born son with autism. Leaving no stone left unturned she courageously healed her life long depression, anxiety, adult onset diabetes and even her son's autism. \"I believe, that I myself was on the verge of death besides suffering from difficult emotional disorders and typical American style chronic health complaints, I almost died from chicken pox, pneumonia and meningitis as an adult. I was very weak and sickly as a child and as an adult I feared for my life and for the lives of my children. I knew that just living a healthy lifestyle would not be enough-that I had chronic constitutional immune deficiency from an unhealthy childhood, I refused to accept it was just \"bad\" genetics.

I feel honored to bring this back to Michigan and through the web!\" Dr. Aurore believes in living a complete healthy lifestyle in all areas of ones life. This is why she home birthed her last two children, breast fed and utilizes natural education such as the Waldorf method and unschooling. \"All of my books coincide with different areas of life; [Beyond Natural Cures](http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/aurore33) is about children and parents, [ Beyond Natural Skincare & Weight Loss](http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/aurore33) is about those things along with diet and nutrition, and [ Til' Love Do Us Part ](http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/aurore33)is about sex and relationships.
