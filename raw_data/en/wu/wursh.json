Dahinden / M.-G. Ineichen-FleischSub-Saharan Africa Many regions in Sub-Saharan Africa possess enormous potential for economic development and the reduction of poverty. Weak structures, confl icts and climate-induced environmental changes hinder this potential from being tapped. North Africa and the Middle East The Arab uprisings are leading to profound changes in the entire region. The violent confl ict in Syria and volatile democratisation processes in North Africa have cast a dark cloud over the hopeful beginning. Asia The impressive economic growth in many Asian countries continues. And yet, over 40% of the world's poorest people and one-third of all refugees worldwide are living in this region. Cultural window Latin America Less poverty, less undernutrition and positive economic growth in resource-rich countries: good news from Latin America. And yet, enormous disparities persist. Eastern Europe and the CIS The remittances sent home by migrants have eased the economic hardship in many countries in the Western Balkans, the Southern Caucasus, and Central Asia. However, over the long term, local jobs are needed - particularly for young people. Global challenges Climate change, water, food security, migration, fi nance and trade Multilateral Cooperation In order to achieve sustainable development and greater social justice, the agendas for poverty reduction, climate change mitigation and the pursuit of a green economy must converge. Swiss partnerships SDC and SECO at a glanceStatistics 2012Annual Report 2012 Table of contents 09 16 22 26 30 34 40 46 49 50 5104 07 23A Glimpse at 2012 Despite diffi cult condi- tions on the ground, Swiss humanitarian aid efforts in 2012 eased the suffering of victims of the Syrian confl ict: the SDC mainly provid-ed assistance to Leba- nese families that had agreed to host Syrian refu-gees, thereby avoiding their having to remain in a refugee camp. The 2012 budget for the victims of the Syrian confl ict was increased to CHF 20 million. 80% of the water re- sources consumed in Switzerland come from outside the country. In 2012, the SDC and the WWF published a report on Switzerland's water footprint that raised pub- lic awareness of this issue. With SDC support, 14 large-sized companies in Colombia and 400 coffee bean producers in Vietnam successfully reduced their water footprints. Both experiences have contribut-ed to the elaboration of a new ISO water footprint standard. Switzerland's contribution to market-based voca-tional education and trai-ning (VET) systems in Eastern Europe is opening true employment pros-pects for young people. Activities pursued in Ko- sovo are a good example: of the 5,000 young people who attended a Swiss-sponsored vocational school in the 2010-2011 academic year, nearly half had already found employment or were working in a self-employed capacity by the spring of 2012. Most of the companies that provided traineeships to these young people were pleased with the level of training reached.Since 2012, the SDC has been able to move be-yond humanitarian aid to pursue a major develop-ment programme in My-anmar. Positive political, economic and social de-velopments have made this step possible. The SDC's activities are centred on vocational education and training (VET), health, ag-riculture and civic participation. In November 2012, Federal Councillor Didier Burkhalter opened an em-bassy in Yangon. In 2012, SECO included the development of inte-grated urban infrastruc-ture among its priorities. This is part of Switzer-land's efforts to address one of the main poverty reduction challenges: the urban population in developing countries is expected to increase by 2.7 billion people between now and 2050. The need to prepare and fund the necessary climate-friendly infrastructures is now. In 2012, Switzerland was very actively involved in efforts to improve the sexual and reproductive health of young people worldwide: on 27 April 2012, under Swiss chair-manship, United Nations ECOSOC's Commission on Population and Develop-ment adopted a groundbreaking resolution that rec-ognises the rights of young people and empowers them to take control over all aspects of their sexuality. Switzerland received international praise for its com-mitment to this issue.

For the fi rst time, there is a comprehensive strategy cov- ering humanitarian aid, development cooperation, cooperation with Eastern Europe as well as economic and trade policy measures. A total credit commitment of CHF 11.35 billion has been set aside for implemen-tation over the 2013-2016 budgetary period. Swiss international cooperation is more than the sum of individual country programmes: Switzerland infl u- ences the development policies of OECD countries, takes part in global thematic initiatives, engages in multilateral development cooperation and provides humanitarian aid. It also supports dialogue between governments and the donor community. The most important themes in 2012 included promotion of a green economy and the start of consultations on new global development objectives. Diffi cult climate for the green economy The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Devel-opment in Rio de Janeiro (Rio+20) was held in June 2012. For the fi rst time, the green economy - i.e. an approach to economic activities that preserves natural resources and upholds social standards - received in-ternational recognition as an important instrument of sustainable development. For Switzerland, which has been a major proponent of the green economy, this is a satisfying outcome because there had been palpable resistance to the green economy in Rio: many devel-oping countries are sceptical of the green economy or completely reject it altogether. Among other things, they are afraid that industrialised countries will use compliance with environmental standards as a techni-cal trade barrier. At the same time, industrialised coun-tries such as the United States, Canada and Australia reject any form of binding conditions. In the future, Switzerland will continue in its efforts to marshal sup- port for economic activities that preserve natural re-sources. Revision of global development objectives Another important result of the Rio+20 conference was the decision to establish Sustainable Develop-ment Goals (SDGs). A proposed draft will be submit-ted to the UN General Assembly by September 2014. With the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set to expire in 2015, Rio+20 participants reached a con-sensus to link the SDG elaboration process to work being done on the post-2015 United Nations develop-ment agenda. Switzerland is working hard to ensure that the new agenda adequately includes all three aspects of sustainable development: economic, social and environmental. Global objectives should also take national realities into account. 20 years of membership with Bretton Woods InstitutionsIn September 2012, the Swiss constituency met to commemorate Switzerland's twenty years of member-ship with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. In addition to Switzerland, the mem-bers of this constituency include Azerbaijan, Kazakh-stan, Kyrgyzstan, Poland, Serbia, Tajikistan, Turkmeni-stan and - in the World Bank - Uzbekistan. Topics of discussion included the effects of the sovereign debt crisis on member states within the constituency. The IMF has played an important role in helping nations to overcome this crisis: in addition to monitoring the monetary and fi nancial policies of its members, the IMF also provides assistance with balance of payment problems. Funding successfully committed In 2012, additional funding was fully committed for water and climate change as part of the increase in of-fi cial development assistance to 0.5% of gross national income. This additional funding can be used for such Development policy environment Sustainable development to counter instability In the autumn of 2012, the Swiss Parliament adopted the Federal Council Dispatch on International Cooperation for 2013-2016 by a clear majority. This is not only a sign of trust but also a commitment: Switzerland has set ambitious targets - precisely in unstable countries where challenges are particularly great.

Nearly 50% of the world population living below the poverty threshold can be found in a fragile context. In the Federal Council Dispatch for 2013-2016, the SDC has therefore increased its commitment in unsta-ble regions such as the Hindu Kush-Himalayan Re-gion, the Horn of Africa, and Tajikistan. In 2012, an independent evaluation team conducted country studies, interviews and focus group discussions to gather information about previous experiences. This evaluation paved the way for differentiated and rapid adjustments of the SDC's commitment in fragile con-texts. It showed fi ve steps that the SDC can take to prepare for future challenges: 1. Focussing greater attention on the causes of fragility 2. Strategically embedding activities within multilateral processes 3. Encouraging closer cooperation between stakeholders 4. Improving risk management, aligning modalities and instruments 5. Providing solid support to programmes and personnel As a learning organisation, the SDC has taken these fi ndings on board: it has revised its policy for fragile contexts, embraced the whole-of-government ap-proach, adapted criteria for country strategies on the basis of challenges in fragile contexts, improved risk analysis capabilities, introduced security reforms and devised a strategy for deployment of personnel in fragile contexts. things as innovative projects to adapt to global warm- ing and should enable Swiss experts to exert greater infl uence at the international level when it comes to water. Existing programmes in the water sector, e.g. in the area of hygiene, have also been expanded. In 2012, a milestone was reached in Switzerland's contribution to EU enlargement, which has helped to further the development of the countries that have joined the EU since 2004: Between 2007 and 2012, Switzerland contributed CHF 1 billion in funding for a total of 210 approved projects in ten new EU member states. Switzerland therefore lived up to its commit-ment within the prescribed period. The purpose of this aid has been to reduce economic and social disparities within an enlarged EU and to strengthen bilateral ties between Switzerland and these countries. Individual projects will continue until June 2017. OECD commends Switzerland Within the scope of a mid-term review, the OECD's Development Assistance Committee (DAC) com-mended Switzerland for its international cooperation activities in 2012. The OECD/DAC highlighted in par-ticular the improved strategic direction resulting from the Federal Council Dispatch for 2013-2016 as well as the overall strategy presented therein. According to the OECD/DAC, the new Federal Council Dispatch is a suitable response to current international cooper-ation challenges. In addition to the pursuit of greater \"policy coherence for development\", which is ex-plicitly mentioned in the Federal Council Dispatch 2013-2016, the OECD/DAC also praised the strong-er focus within the domain of multilateral activities as well as the overall improvements in the manage-ment-by-results approach.

And yet, not every migr ant's story has a happy ending.7Interview Interview with Martin Dahinden and Marie-Gabrielle Ineichen-Fleisch \"We are not afraid to face diffi cult issues.\" Mr Dahinden, the Swiss Parliament adopted the Federal Council Dispatch on International Coop-eration for 2013-2016 by a clear majority in 2012. What do you consider to be its strengths? What are the main challenges? (M.D.) \u2014 For the fi rst time, Switzerland now has a consolidated strategy covering humanitarian aid, de-velopment cooperation, cooperation with Eastern Europe and the CIS as well as economic and trade policy measures. This is a milestone that has been rec-ognised by both the Swiss Parliament and the gen-eral public. We are not afraid to face diffi cult issues: Switzerland has increased its commitment in countries where confl ict is raging as well as in countries whose state institutions are collapsing. These are the places where hardship is most keenly felt. Many of today's challenges affect all countries, albeit to a greater or lesser extent: migration, climate change, health, food insecurity, water shortages, but also governance and challenges in the area of fi nance and trade. The SDC and SECO complement one another. Through our global programmes, we will fi nd new ways for Swit- zerland to help fi nd solutions. Along the way, we shall not lose sight of the living conditions of the destitute to the south and to the east. At the same time, we are also shaping our own future. Ms Ineichen-Fleisch, what steps did SECO take in 2012 in preparation for the new Federal Council Dispatch? (M.-G. I.-F.) \u2014 We have set new priorities with re- gards to urbanisation and labour markets. Our aim is to strike an optimal balance between development policy and economic policy objectives while work-ing to create local jobs. This should also enable us to better respond to challenges in our partner countries - middle income developing countries. These coun-tries in particular play a key role in addressing global challenges such as fi nance and trade, climate change or water shortages. However, their development re-mains fragile: rapid economic growth has done little to eradicate poverty and social disparities. In 2012, we developed new Country Strategies for all our partner countries in the South with tailored economic and trade policy measures. At the same time, we re-structured our organisation to more effectively handle results-based management, quality control and risk management. In 2012, you travelled to partner countries or met with foreign partners in Switzerland. What do you remember most about these experiences? (M.D.) \u2014 In Mongolia, I met shepherd families that lived a hard life and small groups of people looking for gold to break out of poverty. I was impressed at how much SDC employees managed to achieve with little money, great commitment and positive ideas. I was also able to share these impressions with the President of Mongolia. (M.-G. I.-F.) \u2014 Sometimes even a trip to Interlaken is enough for an unforgettable experience: in 2012, Switzerland hosted the 71st Plenary Meeting of the International Cotton Advisory Council (ICAC). I was impressed by the open and constructive dialogue between NGOs, industries, trading companies and government agencies. In addition, SECO's decision to place sustainability on the agenda for the fi rst time generated considerable interest.

Two-thirds of the inhabitants of Sub-Saharan Africa are younger than 25 years of age. Although the introduction of universal access to basic schooling is moving forward, youth unemploy-ment still remains a huge challenge.9Sub-Saharan Africa Sub-Saharan Africa Tapping into one's own resources Sub-Saharan Africa has potential: arable land can be used for agriculture, strong civil society organisations can drive change and rich natural resources can sustain development. The challenges include weak structures, confl icts and climate-induced environmental change. Economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa has been above 5% in recent years and direct investment has surpassed offi cial development assistance (ODA) for the fi rst time. Nevertheless, the uneven distribution of income has prevented economic growth from hav-ing more than a marginal effect on poverty reduc-tion: the world's greatest disparities can be found in Southern Africa, for instance. Poverty, food insecurity and the HIV-AIDS epidemic are the three main risks for development. Climate change also has a major impact on sustainable development and access to water is now a crucial concern. Here, the abundant natural resources in Sub-Saha- ran Africa could be used for development purposes. However, infrastructure and the general conditions needed for growth remain inadequate despite mod-est improvements. Prospects for democratisation are slim. Corruption, clientelism and nepotism erode progress towards good governance and democrati-sation, particularly when raw materials are at stake. There is some room for action in agriculture: Sub- Saharan Africa could double or even triple its output of staple foods and improve food security. And yet only 23% of all arable land is currently being used for agriculture. Greater agricultural productivity is need-ed in response to population growth. Rising food prices, urban demand and improved means of trans-port and communication have created opportunities for farmers. However, since government employees and municipal business people are also interested in land resources, some rural inhabitants may fi nd it dif- fi cult to gain access to land. Likewise, the sharp rise in prices for agricultural products caused by specula-tors or specifi c climatic events place food security and social peace at risk. There have been positive developments in the area of health: child mortality has fallen sharply and the ma-ternal mortality situation has improved somewhat. Infection rates for HIV-AIDS have levelled out. How-ever, access to triple therapy is very uneven. In some countries, people have access and in others they do not. Generally speaking, rural inhabitants are at a dis-advantage compared to urban dwellers. This unjust situation has given rise to awareness campaigns and social movements. The general conditions for true social control are often not present. Civil society is gaining momentum. This trend com- bined with the decentralisation processes should help to bring about change in countries from the grassroots level upwards. There has also been progress in the area of education: more children are completing primary education. Universal access to primary education is becoming a reality and enrolment rates among young girls have increased. At the same time, women are becoming more self-suffi cient. Nevertheless, youth unemploy- ment and demographic imbalances pose major chal-lenges: two-thirds of the inhabitants of Sub-Saharan Africa are below the age of 25. With around 3.2 million people in need, Darfur re- mains the most serious humanitarian challenge. Events transpiring in the Great Lakes Region gave rise to a humanitarian disaster and the situation remains unstable today: violence in the eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo has renewed its downward spiral since April 2012. Clashes between the Congolese army and rebels have resulted in the internal displacement of some 2.4 million inhabit-ants. In the Sahel Region, over 18 million people suffered chronic food shortages in 2012. In contrast, the rainy season in the Horn of Africa was relatively produc-tive. However, refugee camps that were already fi lled to capacity had to accommodate even more refugees and the Dadaab camp in Kenya had to contend with a cholera epidemic. For a long time, Mali was a model of democratisa- tion in Sub-Saharan Africa. Weakened by internal \"There is room for action in agriculture: Sub-Saharan Africa could double or even triple its output of staple foods and improve food security.\"1010Sub-Saharan Africa \"The numer- ous fragile contexts in Sub-Saharan Africa require Swiss inter- national coop- eration to be highly fl exible.\"tensions, Mali was no longer able to stop the rise of fundamentalist groups. Islamists managed to gain control over sizeable portions of Mali and consolidate their control over the northern part of Nigeria and Mauritania at the expense of Tuareg freedom fi ght- ers. The withdrawal of the Al-Shabbaab group from Somalia and the election of a new government are encouraging developments. Ghana also managed to successfully organise its fi fth democratic elections. The SDC's activities in Sub-Saharan Africa are ex- tremely broad, covering such areas as health, rural development and local governance. SECO has been working with partner countries Ghana and South Af-rica to achieve more sustainable and climate-friendly economic growth and to help these two countries become a part of the global economy.The numerous fragile contexts in Sub-Saharan Africa require Swiss international cooperation to be highly fl exible, as is the case in Mali. Unlike other inter- national donors, the SDC chose to remain in Mali, even during the crisis. It intensifi ed its activities in the southern part of the country, where it works with lo-cal communities in decentralised structures. 10I grew up without a father. My mother nevertheless gave me full support during schooling. I studied hard to become one of the best pupils in my class. Tradition requires young girls to de-vote their time to household chores and work in the fi eld, not studying. I wanted to change this image and worked relentlessly until I obtained my baccalaureate in 1996. The following year, I began my studies at university. When my mother died, I went through a hellish pe-riod: in addition to my own problems, I also had to make sure that my sister and brother completed their schooling. For two years, we experienced severe hard-ship. I had to interrupt my university studies in order to earn a living. I began working for the NGO \u00abDignit\u00e9 F\u00e9minine\u00bb in our village. There I heard about a new local development programme called \u00abL'appui suisse \u00e0 la promotion de l'education des fi lles\u00bb (Swiss pro- gramme to encourage the education of young girls, ASPEF). I applied for and obtained a scholarship. In the year 2000, I was able to resume my university studies and obtain a degree in sociology. It was thanks to this scholarship that I was also able to help my sister and brother fi nish school. After completing an ASPEF-organised traineeship, I was hired to work as coordination assistant. In 2003, I led a group of former scholarship recipients to cre-ate a new non-profi t organisation: the action group for the development and self-fulfi lment of women and children. Our aim was to use our own experiences from the ASPEF programme to help young girls and women in our villages. I was chosen to run this organi-sation and have been fully committed to it since 2009. Thanks to our work at the grassroots level, today over twenty students from my home village are now enrolled in the University of Abomey-Calavi in south-ern Benin. Everything that I am able to do now can be traced back to my experiences from ASPEF programme.

Young men working in a goldmine in Obuasi, Ghana. Sub-Saharan Africa's wealth of mineral resources could be used to provide monet ary resources for d evelopment; h owever, v ery often the poor segments of the population hardly even draw any bene t from the lucrative trade in raw materials. The young persons, often working illegall y, expose themselves to enormous health risks. 12nIn Burkina Faso, the work of the SDC and other donors enabled 15,000 pedagogical advi-sors to undergo training in 2012. Around 220,000 adults, mostly women, learnt how to read and write and how to handle important texts. nIn the areas of Mali where the SDC is active, tax revenues increased by 20%. To achieve this objective, the SDC con-solidated the position of traditional representatives of the people. nIn Somaliland, the SDC's Humanitarian Aid and SHA Domain worked with a partner organisation to demine 206 hectares of landand make this land safe to use. In addition, over 70,000 people were made more aware of the dangers of unexploded ordinance and mines. nSince 2009, SECO has lent support to the Ex-tractive Industries Trans-parency Initiative (EITI). The EITI label confi rms that the population of a country has access to information regarding state revenues from mining and oil industries. In 2012, Mozambique and Zambia both met the conditions for obtaining the EITI label. nIn Niger, 930 km 2 of grassland was included Since 2010, maternal mortality rates in areas where the SDC runs projects have fallen from 120 to 80 deaths per 100,000 live births. nThe Private Infra- structure Develop-ment Group (PIDG) has secured private venture capital for infrastructure projects. Since 2002, 100 million people in developing countries now have access to new or better-quality infrastructure. In 2012, SECO decided to contribute an ad-ditional USD 62 million to the PIDG. nWith SDC support, the fi shery association \"Mwaloni\" in Tanzania managed to convince the local authorities that the fi sh market is an important source of tax revenues for the town of Mwanza. The local authorities went on to recognise the fi shermen as part of civil society and provided them with fi nancial support to re- habilitate the market infrastructure. nIn South Sudan, mortality rates and undernutrition in the \"Unity\" and \"Upper Nile\" refugee camps have fallen sharplythanks to good coop-eration between the SDC's Humanitarian Aid and SHA Domain, the Offi ce of the United Nations High Commis-sioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). nWith bilateral projects to introduce taxation reform in Ghana, Burkina Faso and Mozambique, SECO has helped to generate higher tax revenues , create fairer taxation systems and improve conditions for the private sector, which should lead to long-term sustainable economic growth. in a distribution plan and made available to shepherds. Signs were placed along 1,350 km of shepherd routes to facilitate herding. nWith SECO support, South Africa has already brought six fair trade travel packages to the European market. The opening up of new markets has led to the creation of 34 new tourism companies in South Africa, which employ 900 people. nIn northern Mozam- bique, 844 smallholder farmers were able to double their soybean output and more than triple their income.Through the transfer of technology, the SDC has helped farmers to improve the quality and quantity of their soybean production to satisfy the needs of the private company that buys the soybeans. nIn the Great Lakes Region, the SDC has been instrumental in providing two million people with access to good-quality basic healthcare services.

At the end of December, the Islamists began destroying historical mausoleums in Timbuktu, amputating people's limbs in Gao and pushing separatists to the Algerian border. In doing so, they have demonstrated their complete control over an immense territory that they now consider to be their laboratory. Countless metaphors do not even come close to expressing the depth of the abyss created by the withdrawal of Malian authori-ties from two-thirds of the country. The population of the northern part of Mali is less than half that of the country's capital, Bamako, and the area has very little impact on the country's overall balance of trade. And yet, the situation poses an exis-tential threat to the country and the entire region. At stake is the Sahel, a belt of territory stretching across the entire African continent from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea. The Sahel, which means \u00abshore\u00bb or \u00abcoast\u00bb in Arabic, has become a wild no-man's land, entirely off limits to Western tourists and even the most daring of humanitarian aid workers. The Sahel has become a lawless place where organised crime groups are free to act with impunity, from kidnap-ping and ransom to drug traffi cking. In this particu- lar case, cocaine arrives from South America to the West African coast where it is then transported along Trans-Saharan routes to Europe. This criminal econ-omy further undermines legitimate business in the entire sub-region. The Malian economy, which used to grow at constant rates, has now entered a reverse spiral as investments have dried up. Cultural tourism used to draw some 400,000 visitors each year. The sector created jobs for young people in parts of the country where no other employment prospects existed. Prestigious sites such as Djenn\u00e9, Timbuktu and the Dogon area were essential stops along tourist circuits for travellers in the sub-region. Tour operators used to include Malian sites in their tour packages. Long hoped for projects such as the Timbuktu route or the laying of fi bre optic cables in northern Mali have been interrupted. So, in addition to having to contend with terror, populations have also lost bud-ding infrastructures. War has come to complete this bleak picture. None of these indications are encouraging. Nevertheless, social ties remain dense in Mali and the promise of justice could lead to even greater consolidation. This is because Malian society has not collapsed. There is room for remarkably diverse exchange. The re-silience of occupied populations can be seen on a daily basis in their rejection of extremist sentiment. New frames of reference have emerged around values such as solidarity, protecting neighbours, the physical courage of young people and women who stand up against unjust rules, the determina-tion of religious people who challenge obscurantist orders, the commitment of volunteer teachers, the resurgence of gardening and local medicine. The structures created during the decentralisation pro-cess - a process that was assisted by Switzerland - have made all of these dynamics possible. They have helped public services to be reorganised from the ground up. Faced with armed aggression, the population practices civil disobedience. Justice re-mains the preferred option over vengeance. The challenge is now for those who have helped the country in the past. Will they be tempted to con-clude that any new investments will lead nowhere? Although understandable, such a response would equate to punishing the victims rather than recog-nising their enormous capacity to bounce back from hardship. It would amount to denying the existence of a formidable spirit of vitality and hope in the face of adversity. Mohomodou Houssouba is a writer and scientist from Mali. He lives in Basel. Casting a retrospective glance at the year 2012Twelve-year-old Saleha fl ed from Syria with her parents to a refugee camp in Turkey. She always carries the identity card of her slain brother with herself. By the beginning of 2013, well over one million persons had fl ed to neighbouring countries, in addition to the over two million internally displaced persons within Syria. 16Northern Africa and the Middle East Northern Africa and the Middle East Between revolution and transition Violent confl ict in Syria and volatile democratisation processes in North Africa have cast a dark cloud over hopeful developments in the region. From Morocco to Yemen, refugees and IDPs are in need of protection. Switzerland is working to create new prospects. The situation in countries of North Africa and the Middle East is fragile and unstable, with differences from country to country. While North Africa has mo-ved beyond revolution to its current state of transiti-on, bloody confl icts are still raging in places like Sy- ria and elsewhere in the Middle East. Islamic groups and parties enjoy considerable support in most of the countries, winning democratic elections in seve-ral places. Profound changes are sweeping across the entire region. The people have placed enormous expecta-tions on the new governments. And yet, the tran-sition from revolution to democracy has not been without major diffi culties: revision of the social con- tract, economic and political reforms and securing the social welfare system. Through Switzerland's programme in North Afri- ca, the SDC, SECO, the Directorate of Political Affairs, the Directorate of International Law and the Federal Offi ce for Migration are all working to help Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and Morocco in three key areas: the transition to democracy and strengthening of human rights; economic development and job cre-ation; migration and the protection of people who are particularly at risk. The programme in North Africa has allowed Switzerland to make considera-ble progress since 2011. New structures have been established to better coordinate activities through Switzerland's embassies in Cairo and Tunis. The SDC also works with partners to achieve peaceful and constructive progress through a confl ict-sensitive approach. Working to create economic prospects in Egypt, SECO is pursuing projects to develop and support small- and medium-sized enterprises. These projects seek to improve competitiveness and create jobs. In addition, SECO is helping the government to impro-ve its management of public fi nances as well as the water infrastructure and healthcare system.In Tunisia, SECO activities are centred on improving the urban infrastructure as well as on improving the value-added chain and exports. SECO also works to enhance the competitiveness of local companies by helping them to gain access to credit and investment and by improving the fi nancial sector. Switzerland gives priority to achieving stable and democratic conditions - not the least because of the region's close proximity to Europe. For the longest time, current migration fl ows have been caused by humanitarian, social and economic cri-ses. These migration fl ows continued within the en- tire region in 2012 and in some cases - as with the Syrian crisis - even intensifi ed. The United Nations estimates that in December 2012 alone, around 2 million Syrians were internally displaced and over half a million fl ed to neighbouring countries. In Ye- men, the migration fl ow from the Horn of Africa has not diminished. In North Africa, migrants from countries south of the Sahara are still in need of protection and basic services. From North Africa, migration fl ows towards Europe require new solu- tions. In the entire region, people are exposed to natural hazards such as earthquakes, fl oods, lands- lides, droughts and desertifi cation. The sudden crisis in Syria and growing humanitari- an need posed major challenges to the internatio-nal community and Switzerland in 2012, especially since the deteriorating security situation prevented aid workers from gaining direct access to people in need. In February 2012, the decision was reached to move the Swiss Embassy and the SDC's cooperation offi ce in Damascus to Beirut and Amman respec- tively. This meant that the SDC had to coordinate hu-manitarian activities from the regional cooperation offi ce in Amman. On the positive side, the SDC has been able to rely on a network of partner organisa-tions built gradually over the years. This network can identify needs on the ground and monitor activities co-funded by Switzerland. \"The sudden crisis in Syria and growing humanitarian need posed major chal- lenges to the international community and Switzerland in 2012.\"17Northern Africa and the Middle East In response to the escalation in Syria, the SDC in- tensifi ed its emergency relief activities and devoted its attention to protecting refugees and providing psychosocial support to victims of trauma. From the start of the crisis to the end of 2012, the SDC has spent CHF 20 million on over thirty projects to help populations affected by the confl ict. 40% of these funds have been used in Syria and 60% in neigh-bouring countries Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. In Lebanon and Jordan, the SDC continues to play a leading role in building national and local capacities in the area of disaster risk reduction (DRR), particu-larly with regards to prevention, readiness and rapid response. In Yemen, the SDC has worked with part-ner organisations to improve the living conditions of refugees and IDPs. Families hosting refugees Hassan Kanaan lives in the village of Al Saleh in the Lebanese region of Akroum. Despite having to contend with their own modest means, many families in northern Lebanonhave taken in refugees from S yria. In order to improve their nancial situation, the SDC has provided funding to host families in the Lebanese towns of Akroum and Wadi Khaled. They arrived in the night, in tears and as-ked us to take them in. They had brought nothing with them and didn't know anyone. I im-mediately accepted them into my old house. Oum Omar, the mother, had paid 5,000 Syrian pounds for her and each of her family members to cross the bor-der into Lebanon. This border area is mined. She told me that before that she had had to pay 150,000 Sy-rian pounds in Homs to secure the release of her son who had been abducted. On the return trip home, neighbours repeatedly fi red shots at them. Fortuna- tely, she was not injured. The same neighbours had attacked her house on several occasions and stolen all of her belongings. On the last occasion, they had set her house on fi re. The family had no other choice but to fl ee. The situation of Oum Omar is similar to that of many other Syrian families here in Akroum. I was worried about them, but also about my own family since our fi nancial resources were already limited before they arrived. Monthly support from the SDC has helped to ease the fi nancial burden and I am very thankful that we can continue to host them in decent conditions. I hope that the confl ict will end soon so that the Sy- rian families can return to their villages. After all, there's no place like home. 1818Results in 2012 in Northern Africa and the Middle East Northern Africa and the Middle East Northern Africa: SECO by themes 2012(in %)Northern Africa and the Middle East: SDC by themes 2012(in %) Private sector development Financing of infrastructuresMacroeconomic support Trade promotion 18nThe fi nancial support provided by the SDC has enabled 10,000 inter-nally displaced persons (IDPs) in the Syrian town of Aleppo to eat one warm meal each day. Due to the increasing lack of food security, poor shepherd families have also been provided with support so that they can maintain their sources of income and food production. nIn Tunisia, SECO has been working to intro-duce cleaner produc- tion methods. National experts have already undergone training and twenty companies (out of a total of seventy-fi ve) specialised in road construction, leather and textile produc-tion, agriculture and tourism were able to signifi cantly improve their environmental footprint. nIn northern Lebanon, the SDC gave cash con-tributions to 500 poor Lebanese host families so that they could host around 3,500 Syrian refugees. Thanks to this project, no refugee camps have thus far had to be built in Lebanon for the people of Syria. nIn Tunisia, SECO and the \"International Trade Centre\" have helped to devise an export strat-egy for the vegetable ment plants, serving more than one millions people. nIn Morocco, the SDC's disaster preven- tion efforts have been recognised at the highest level. The King gave his approval for improved civil protection. With certifi cation from the International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG), the civil pro-tection service has now reached an internation-ally recognised level of quality. nIn Gaza, the SDC sponsored a training programme for young people with scholastic diffi culties.

The gathering was organised as part of a SECO-sponsored regional programme run by the International Finance Corporation (IFC). The greater exchange of knowledge should serve to better anchor this pro-gramme in the region. nIn Tunisia, an SDC programme to encour-age small enterprises in 12 economically chal-lenged provinces has so far led to the creation of around 3,000 jobs and the formation of 1,000 small enter-prises. Short-term jobs were also created as a result of projects to im-prove the water supply and rehabilitate school buildings. nThe SDC provided the Geneva Centre for the Democratic Con-trol of Armed Forces (DCAF) with the funding needed to set up a multi-donor trust fund to reform the security sector in North Africa.

The changes taking place in the region are profound, and the people are placing high expectations on their govern- ments. Yet revolutions do not always immediate ly lead to democratic conditions, but are rather the starting point for demanding processes of transition.21Northern Africa and the Middle East Carte Blanche for Perihan Abou-Zeid Shaping Egypt's Future through Social Media In 2008, a labour activist named Wael Habib called for a labour strike on April 6, to defend the rights of textile workers in El-Mahalla El-Kubra (an industrial city in the Nile Delta). To his surprise the strike was joined by 60 to 80 thousand workers from different industries, to become the largest labor strike Egypt had ever witnessed since Mubarak became Presi-dent. A few days before the Mahalla strike, a group of young activists followed Habib's calls and called for a general strike on social media and through text messages. And that was the birth of the political movement now known as 6 April, and indeed the fi rst time Social Media was effectively utilized for political mobilization. There are a lot of examples of initiatives that depen- ded heavily on Social Media, over the past 2 years. I am proud to be part of one of the rising start-ups in Egypt that were born out of the revolution, on YouTube, QabilaTV. We focused on creating apoli-tical content that educates people about politics, economics, human rights and civic engagement in an entertaining way. There are further examples of successful cyber- activism. The \"We are all Khaled Said\" page is by far the most successful example of cyber activism that followed the typical cycle and resulted in histo-ric mobilization. In his book \"Revolution 2.0\" Wael Ghonim explains how he used the page to mobilize the people. He told the story of Khaled Said and how he was unjustly tortured to death by members of the Police force. But what was certainly untypi-cal about that page was the non-aggressive tone they adopted, to appeal to mainstream Egyptians. They highlighted cases of corruption but also stories of good deeds by police offi cers. They were simply speaking the language of the people, and when they called for peaceful action, people simply com-plied. Rassd is a news network that was launched on Face- book in January 2011 by young activists that wanted to report the truth out of Tahrir Square. Now Rassd receives millions of hits every day on their website, and by many it is considered a credible source of informa-tion. Additionally, two young computer scientists deci-ded to use their skills in creating two online reporting initiatives, Zabatak.com, a crowdsourcing platform for users to report on any misbehaviour or illegal practices during parliamentary elections, and Morsimeter.com, a tracker of President Morsi's performance in reference to the promises he made for his fi rst 100 days in offi ce. However, Social Media has not always been effec- tive. When activist groups started online campaigns calling upon the people to vote \"No\" for the con-stitutional amendments, their calls failed miserably. And so did the campaign for voiding votes in the second round of presidential elections. Why is that? The answer, though too simple, seems to be too diffi cult to be put into action by the majority of po- litical groups, especially current opposition parties. Simply, Social Media is a tool, a very effective one, but is only a channel that can act as a catalyst on certain occasions and most importantly with specifi c audience; the most important element in any story is the people. It is the people that look for infor-mation, consume it and act accordingly. The trick is to know when to use Social Media to tell the truth or mobilize young audiences, and when to depend on direct communication through fi eld operations - most adopted by the Muslim Brotherhood - to listen to people and convince them with one's viewpoints.

And yet, over 40% of the world's poorest people and one-third of all refugees live in this region. Switzerland works to reduce poverty and address environmental issues. Asian countries have become less dependent on western countries. At the same time, trade fl ows within the continent have risen sharply. China still massively invests in transport infrastructure, hydro-electric power, mining and commercial agriculture as well as in countries where Switzerland carries out development cooperation activities. The working-age population in Asia is expected to increase by 40% between now and 2040. By 2030, an additional 15 million people will enter the labour market each year. The opening up of borders to goods, services, capital and workers offers new opportunities but also cre-ates two major problems: for one thing, many peo-ple lack adequate training and are therefore unable to rise above their current low-income status. This is particularly the case in the Mekong region; secondly, pressure on land resources is increasing. In some in-stances, this is having a negative impact on ethnic mi-norities, the poorest population segments and food security. The SDC focuses primarily on programmes relating to agriculture, food security and governance. For its part, SECO devotes its attention to issues such as good economic governance, environmental issues and climate aspects. In Mongolia, the mining industry has contributed to a rapid economic boom. Demand for a wide range of occupational skills is increasing and young peo-ple in particular require suitable vocational education and training. In some cases, the granting of unlimited land use rights has had a negative impact on food security and the management of natural resources, posing major development challenges both from an economic and legal standpoint. In Cambodia and Myanmar, Switzerland is currently expanding its commitment. In the new priority coun-try Myanmar, Switzerland has provided humanitarian support to people affected by Cyclone Nargis and previous confl icts. At the same time, a development programme has been launched. Following recent po-litical, social and economic reforms under the new government, Switzerland - like many other European countries and the United States - has lifted its sanc-tions against Myanmar and opened up an embassy in Yangon. This embassy also houses an SDC fi eld offi ce. Vietnam has closed the gap with middle-income countries. The SDC intends to gradually phase out its activities between now and 2016. SECO still has a comprehensive economic development programme in both Vietnam and Indonesia, which is SECO's sec-ond priority country in Asia. Sustainable trade, de-velopment of the fi nancial sector, improvement of the business environment and the creation of basic infrastructures are key pillars of both programmes. In Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam, the SDC seeks to close the development gap with other countries of the region and prepare these countries for the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), which will come into existence in 2015. With support from SECO, Laos successfully completed its negotiations for membership to the World Trade Organization (WTO). The offi cial registration of 75 non-profi t or- ganisations in 2012 contributed greatly towards encouraging Laotian civil society. This positive devel-opment was nevertheless overshadowed by the \u00abdis-appearance\u00bb of a prominent fi gure of Laotian civil society in December 2012 and the increasing fear of the population to freely express its views. The Hindu Kush-Himalayan Region is threatened by climate change. Ten of the largest river systems in the region originate from this region, which supplies wa-ter to over 210 million people living in the lowlands. The cross-border management of water resources is therefore of crucial importance. Nepal has taken important steps towards lasting peace. The former Maoist rebel fi ghters have been integrated into the regular Army. However, the peace process is not yet complete. The main problem lies at the governmental level where political parties have found it diffi cult to agree on common objectives. Bangladesh is on its way to becoming an emerging country. Despite political and economic stability, vio-lent protests over the fi lm \"Innocence of Muslims\", \"By 2030, an additional 15 million people will enter the labour market each year.\" 23Asia 2323which resulted in the killings of members of the Buddhist minority, are to be taken seriously. Greater efforts are needed from government and civil society organisations to achieve a viable and stable democ-racy. In Sri Lanka, the last of the refugee camps were closed. While most of the internally displaced per-sons (IDPs) have returned to their homes, some IDPs have settled down in state-allocated areas or con-tinue to live with host families. Demining efforts in the northern part of the country are expected to take years. The rebuilding of villages in the northern and eastern parts of the country has begun thanks to the involvement of international actors.Work in an increasingly fragile context such as Paki- stan and Afghanistan remains particularly challeng-ing. Tasks such as constantly monitoring the security situation, using confl ict-sensitive instruments and working closely with local inhabitants, particularly women, have enabled the SDC to remain in these countries. In Afghanistan, western troops are sched-uled to withdraw by the end of 2014, which could have a negative impact on stability in the entire region, including neighbouring countries. In 2007, I began working on our family's cocoa farm without the requisite exper- tise. The price per kilo was good at the time. I de-cided to stop growing chilli peppers, onions, ginger and other plant varieties and began growing cocoa plants. The yield per hectare was as high as 400 kg of cocoa per year. However, I wasn't satisfi ed with this level of produc- tion. So, in 2010, I began attending a fi eld school for smallholder farmers, which is sponsored by Swiss-contact. There I learned about proper cocoa farming methods and how to use them. Among other things, they showed us how to properly trim cocoa plants. I applied this knowledge on my own farm. Initially, my neighbours couldn't understand why I was remov-ing so many stems and leaves from my cocoa plants. They thought I had lost my mind. However, cutting away all of the foliage allowed more sunlight to shine on the plants. Today, my neighbours still think I am crazy but in the good sense: the harvest from my cocoa farm has grown enormously - from an annual yield of 400 kg per hectare to 1,000 kg per hectare. The techniques taught in the fi eld school made this improvement pos- sible: frequent harvests, pruning of plants, proper fer-tilisation and better-quality seeds. I also learnt how to build an organisation. A group of 29 cocoa farmers and I formed an association of cocoa producers. This association supplies farmers with young plants and of-fers microfi nance services. In 2011, in recognition of the strong commitment of our members, the provin-cial government of Aceh commended our association as the second best association of cocoa producers. Family incomes have improved thanks to the higher levels of cocoa production. I can now send my three children to a baccalaureate school to prepare them for university. In recognition of my hard work, I was given the Best Cocoa Farmer of the Aceh Prov-ince Award in November 2012.

Measures to prevent soil erosion and deforestation in an area of over 50 km 2 have helped to protect over 75,000 people from dangerous spring tides. nIn Vietnam, SECO successfully completed a pilot project to train thirty fi nance ministry experts on how to use the new macroeco- nomic forecasting model. The knowledge gained from this will now be applied in the fi eld. SECO has also contributed to reforms in the management of public fi nances. nIn Pakistan, the SDC introduced new farming and irriga-tion methods in 330 villages. This enabled around 4,000 families to increase their pro- duction . By restoring a clean water supply for over 46,000 people, the SDC's Humanitarian Aid and SHA Domain has helped to reduce waterborne diseases. nIn Cikarang, one of the largest indus-trial parks in Indonesia, SECO has helped to build the country's quantity of cocoa har- vests as well as greater income for farmers. 1,520 cooperatives also received training in the area of organisational and fi nancial manage- ment. nIn Bangladesh, civic participation has in- creased tremendously. 200,000 people, mostly poor, now have access to more transparent and better-quality ser-vices. 300,000 people, 40% of whom women, play an active role in local decision-making processes. nThe SDC's Hu- manitarian Aid and SHA Domain provides families in northern Sri Lanka with technical and fi nancial support to help them rebuild 2,750 houses. It has also contributed to the rehabilitation of infra-structure, particularly schools. These efforts set the stage for a return to normal. nIn Mongolia a total of 2.1 million custom-ers handled their administrative affairs in one of thirty-fi ve \"one- stop shops\" in 2012. The simplifi ed access to public services was particularly benefi cial for women and inhabit-ants of rural areas. Customer satisfaction was 94.5%. nIn Mongolia, all state institutions in the District of Khovd have been equipped with electric stoves. This has enabled food to be provided to 12,000 people each day. At the same time, the measure has served to protect 1,485 hectares of vegetation, which would otherwise have been used as fuel. nIn Vietnam, SECO modernised quality control equipment in four testing labora-tories. These facilities are now able to issue internationally rec-ognised certifi cates (e.g. for agricultural export products). This is important in ensur-ing that Vietnamese products gain access to international markets. fi rst dry port. The new dry port should divert some of the work-load associated with customs clearance and cargo handling away from Tanjung Priok, Indonesia's largest port.

It determines how modern a society wishes to be-come. It gives the weak a voice and sets the pace of social progress. Artists speak to the rational mind but also awaken emotions. They are the catalysts of social change. Swiss international cooperation efforts recognise the crucial role of art and culture in development, particularly in countries experienc-ing unrest and instability. Switzerland supports the cultural sector in partner countries and helps artists and cultural productions from the southern hemi-sphere, Eastern Europe and the CIS to gain access to the Swiss cultural market and to the general public. In so doing, Switzerland helps to maintain the diversity of cultural forms of expression and fosters intercultural dialogue. These two aspects are important in ensuring development-friendly globalisation. The image that the media has portrayed of Af- ghanistan over the past decade does not do jus-tice to the country. In cooperation with \"3rd Eye\", Afghanistan's fi rst professional photojournalism centre, the SDC organised a photo exhibition that casts the country in an entirely different light. Por-traying the daily lives of millions of Afghani people was a major challenge. 50,000 people visited the travelling exhibition in Afghanistan. In the autumn of 2012, it was shown at the Kornhausforum Bern in Switzerland for the fi rst time, and became one of the most popular exhibitions of the year there.At the heart of social change: art and culture27\"Notre-Dame du Nil\" is a novel set in Rwanda in the early 1970s.

Ms Mukasonga later received France's Renaudot Prize for litera- ture. For the author, these awards are an important step towards recognition of the history of her people.

Digital technology is leading to a reversal of this trend. In 2012, two SDC-funded projects helped to revive African cinema: the fi rst was a funding mecha- nism to foster local fi lm production and distribu- tion in Burkina Faso (called \"Succ\u00e8s cin\u00e9ma Burkina Faso\"); the second involved the strong presence of African cinema at the Locarno Film Festival. Over twenty African fi lmmakers and producers were present and took advantage of the opportunity to strengthen their skills and secure funding for future fi lm projects.Asia 28Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries on Earth. Covering an area roughly three and a half times the size of Switzerland, it is home to 150 million people. Around 60 million people work in the agricultural sector alone, many earning less than CHF 2 per day. One of the main causes of poverty in this country is the lack of access to up-to-date information on market prices and prod-ucts to control pests and diseases. With only around 14,000 agricultural consultants, the public sector is unable to address the needs of farmers. At the same time, the mobile phone industry is growing at a breath-taking pace in Bangladesh. The country currently has roughly 100 million cell phone subscribers and the network covers nearly 100% of the national territory. For workers involved in the SDC co-funded Catalyst project, the rapid spread of cell phone use was per-ceived as an innovative and potentially sustainable way to provide better services to farmers: In part- nership with private mobile phone operator Bangla-link, Catalyst set up a telephone advisory service for farmers. By calling the number 7676, farmers are connected to a call centre where they can obtain Internet-based information on agriculture. Bangla-link has signed an income distribution agreement with the call centre, which keeps agricultural infor-mation up-to-date. The telephone advisory service 7676 was launched in 2008. Since then, a total of around 250,000 calls have been received. It is estimated that the informa-tion service has enabled farmers to earn approxi-mately CHF 3.8 million more in income than would otherwise have been possible. The call centre now works independently and its activities have gener-ated a suitable income for Banglalink. Other mobile phone operators have expressed interest in similar business models. In 2009, the 7676 initiative re-ceived the GSMA Asia Mobile Award. 7676 - reducing poverty four digits at a time \"My children now have a roof overtheir heads and food on the table.\" Rasa Selvarani is 44 years old and lives in the village of Kaithadi (Navatkuli, Jaff na) in Sri Lanka. Since the war ended in May 2009, the SDC has provided support to families returning home to northern Sri Lanka. This support includes both nancial contributions and technical advice on how to rebuild houses and schools as well as how to establish small enterprises. I am a mother of eight children - six girls and two boys. I lost my husband in 2009, towards the end of the confl ict. I initially arrived with my children at the Menik Farm for internally displaced persons (IDPs). We stayed there for nine months. In 2010, we were fi nally able to return to our village in Jaffna, after having lived as IDPs for ten years. One of my daughters was forcefully recruited to fi ght for the rebels and was injured in battle. Later, her hus-band abandoned her. After her release from a prison camp, she returned to me. Another daughter now works as a demining specialist in Nagarkovil, and one of my sons is a bricklayer. The three youngest children are still in school. As for me, I attended school only until I was ten years old. My only source of income came from raising chickens. We lost our home and land during the con-fl ict. After returning to the village, I received fi nan- cial support from an SDC housing construction pro-gramme. Working with my two sons, we were able to build a house with three bedrooms, a kitchen and a living room. In addition to the funding received to build our new house, I also received fi nancial contri- butions to set up a business. With a loan of USD 400, I bought 30 chickens as well as a small chicken pen and fodder. I am now able to sell around 15 eggs per day. I earn about USD 2 per day. I am very happy to earn this regular income. In addition to SDC support, I took out another loan for USD 1,500 to fi nish the house. This income allows me to pay back the loan in month-ly instalments. My daughter, who lives with me, also received funding from the SDC to earn a living. She used the money to buy four cows and contributes to the family's costs.A monk at an open-air stand in Yangon, Myanmar, seeks out a new cell phone for himself.

And yet, enormous disparities persist. Uncertain land rights are a major concern for indigenous people in particular and climate change remains a poverty risk. With an economic growth rate of 4.2% in 2012, the positive trend in Latin America continues. The eco-nomic dynamics in Latin America have nevertheless become even more uneven: while the economies of resource-rich countries in South America are boo-ming, economic growth in Central America and in the Caribbean has been only moderate. In order to consolidate positive economic development, the re-gion needs to close the signifi cant productivity gap and move beyond its unilateral dependence on raw material exports. Poverty and undernutrition in Latin America are the lowest that they have been in the past twenty years. Back in 1990, the proportion of poor people in the population stood at around 48%. By 2010, this pro-portion had fallen to 31%. Over the same period, undernutrition fell from 15% to 8%. Social dispari-ties persist, however: in no other part of the world is the concentration of income greater than in Latin America. Ten Latin American countries are among the fi fteen countries worldwide with the highest income disparities. Colombia, in which a civil war has been raging for over four decades, is a prime example. While the richest 10% of the population shares 50% of the gross domestic product (GDP), the poorest 10% share just under 0.6% of GDP . Remittances from friends and family working ab- road are important for the whole of Latin America and the Caribbean. These money transfers often compensate for the inadequate or non-existent so-cial safety net in countries of origin. After falling somewhat in 2011 , remittances have now returned to pre-crisis levels of around USD 69 billion. Re-mittances are also an important source of foreign currency. In Haiti, for instance, remittances account for more than 20% of GDP and are the country's main source of foreign currency. The volume of re-mittances is twice as high as income derived from exports. Indigenous people are particularly affected by poverty and have considerably less access to pub-lic services such as education and health. According to estimates, there are around 50 million indigenous people (roughly 10% of the total population) in La-tin America and the Caribbean. Although the rights of indigenous people have been recognised since the 1970s and enshrined in international treaties and national constitutions, their living conditions have remained practically unchanged. Uncertain land rights, inadequate access to land and usage of land are the main challenges and increasingly the source of confl icts. The unilateral dependence of Latin American growth on land-hungry and less labour-intensive mining activities creates particular challenges for development policy. Despite a certain degree of progress towards po- verty reduction, the effects of climate change and natural disasters in many countries of the region are still a signifi cant poverty risk. The recent exceptio- nally high rainfall, which was caused by the ocean-atmosphere phenomenon \u00abLa Ni\u00f1a\u00bb, has had an above-average impact on the poorest population segments. Colombia is among the countries most at risk. Although Central America remained free of major natural disasters in 2012, it is still expo-sed to major weather events: in 2012, the poorest had to contend with both hurricanes (Isaac, Sandy) and droughts. Haiti and Cuba have been unable to address food security concerns or restore damaged buildings and infrastructures. Central America is among the regions most affected by climate change. The SDC's development cooperation activities are focussed on Bolivia, Central America (Honduras and Nicaragua) and Cuba. Andean countries have also received support from the SDC's Global Programme Climate Change Section and the SDC's Water Initia-tives Section. Since 2010, the SDC's commitment in Haiti has increased both in terms of reconstruction and development activities. SECO helped its partner countries Peru and Colombia to reduce disparities, create jobs and diversify into niche products. One problem often faced by workers involved in SDC projects in Latin America is the rapid change of \"Social disparities persist: in no other part of the world is the concentra- tion of income greater than in Latin America.\"Latin America contact persons within local governments. The SDC therefore works with a broad spectrum of partners at both national and grassroots levels to ensure that work on individual projects remains both effi cient and uninterrupted. 31Latin America 31 A life of freedom Lenny Visalla Villalba was born on the \u00abLa Abra\u00bb estate in the Gran Chaco region of Bolivia in 1982. In Bolivia, there are still around 750 Guarani families who live in conditionsof exploitation on large estates. The SDC has provided funding to the human rights offi ce since 1999. This offi ce, which is part of the Bolivian Ministry of Justice, seeks to help the Guarani people defend and assert their rights. I began working on the large estate where I was born as soon as I turned eight. Together with my parents and younger sib-lings, I worked in the fi eld, took care of pigs and also looked after the children of the estate owner. When I turned sixteen, I was entitled to a wage of fi ve bolivianos per day (around CHF 0.50). At the end of each year, however, the estate owner de-ducted costs such as food and clothing provided to us. Most of the time, these costs exceeded the wage itself and so the wage was either not paid or the workers accumulated a debt with the estate owner. We lived in a small hut, which belonged to the es- tate owner, and did not own our own land. We thought that we would spend our entire lives on this estate. We were blind because we were una-ware of our rights. In 2001, the NGO Medicus Mundi helped us to gain our freedom. It acquired land that we and twenty other families could live on. In the years that followed, the human rights of-fi ce helped us to formalise our land rights. After I turned twenty-four, I decided to continue with my schooling, which I had had to interrupt when I was thirteen because the estate only offered an educa-tion up to grade 4. When I turned twenty-seven, I obtained my baccalaureate (school-leaving certifi - cate) and am currently studying pedagogy so that I can teach children in my home region. Despite considerable hardship, I have managed to pay for my own studies. I work evenings and weekends as a household employee. I recently obtained a schol-arship. I am very grateful for everything that the human rights offi ce has taught me. Today, I am more self-confi dent and obtain good marks. I look forward to becoming a teacher and helping my people. 32Latin America Results in 2012 in Latin America Latin America: SECO by themes 2012(in %)Latin America: SDC by themes 2012(in %) Private Financing of infrastructuresMacroeconomic support Trade promotionHealth (<1%) EducationAgriculture, water and environment Rule of law, democracy Other (economy and employ- ment/confl ict prevention) Humanitarian aid 32nIn Peru, SECO helped the Ministry of Finance to improve its manage-ment of public fi nances. This included improve-ments to planning processes, implementa-tion, as well as budget control. This has led to a more effi cient use of public funds and greater transparency. nSince 2011, the SDC has worked in Haiti to develop microinsur-ance services for small enterprises. 12,000 of the total of 59,000 clients benefi tted from these services in 2012: they lost everything due to hurricanes Isaac and Sandy. These microinsur-ance policies protect them from having to go deeply in debt and become even more impoverished. nIn Cuba, over 50,000 farmers - nearly one-fourth of all of the country's farmers - increased their yield of beans, corn and other vegetables by about 30% to 80%. For the past four years, the SDC has helped them to diversify their crops and use better-quality seeds. nIn Peru, SECO has played a pivotal role in the drafting and enact-ment of an ordinance on the recovery and disposal of old electri- nIn Nicaragua, the SDC has helped local governments and civil society partners in com-munities to improve governance, increase community incomesby 35% and achieve greater civic participa-tion in political pro-cesses. nProcess and quality management is impor-tant for the optimisa-tion of operational procedures: SECO has helped 30 small- and medium-sized enter-prises in Colombia to improve their capabilities in this area. As a result, production errors and energy consumption has fallen along with the incidence of work-related accidents. nIn Nicaragua and Honduras, Swiss efforts over the past four years have led to signifi cant progress in the area ofdrinking water and settlement sanitation:54,000 people now have access to drinking water, 33,000 people now use latrines. In 43 schools, 5,100 children have access to clean wa-ter and toilet facilities. nIn Colombia, the SDC's Humanitarian Aid and SHA Domain has helped to protect the civilian populationin the armed confl ict. Priority has been given to achieving greater respect for fundamental rights. The SDC's Hu-manitarian Aid and SHA Domain is also working closely with the ICRC, UNHCR and other part-ner organisations and provides assistance to United Nations experts. nAt the Competence Centre for Reconstruc-tion (CCR) in Haiti, which was established by the SDC's Humani-tarian Aid and SHA Domain, construction workers acquire practical knowledge on how to build structures that are capable of withstand- ing earthquakes and tropical cyclones. The CCR teaching staff includes experts from local private businesses as well as from the SHA. These experts use train-ing modules that were developed in-house. nThanks to SECO's commitment, around 100 small- and medium-sized enterprises from regional chambers of commerce in Colombia were provided with training in corporate governance. The aim of the programme is to make these companiesmore competitive,reduce the risk of bank-ruptcy and improve ac-cess to fi nancial services.cal appliances. The new ordinance requires manufacturers and dealers to comply with requirements by the end of 2013. nOver the past three years, and with the help of the SDC, the Ombudsman for human rights in Bolivia has managed to introduce the rights of vulnera- ble population groupsin national policies. It was also successful in enforcing compliance with labour and land rights and protecting the right of around 12,000 people to physi-cal and mental integrity. nIn Bolivia, the SDC runs a project to en-courage the sustainable use of natural resources. Thanks to this project, which includes erosion protection and improved farming techniques, around 20,000 farmer families have avoided crop loss in the wake of natural disasters. Their incomes have increased by 15% and they now enjoy better food security. 16 19495 11 45 2514 1633HAITI PERU BOLIVIACOLOMBIACUBA REGIONAL PROGRAMME CENTRAL AMERICALatin America 33SDC Priority countries and regions, special programmes SDC Humanitarian Aid Focus Area SECO Priority countries and programmes34Eastern Europe and the CIS Eastern Europe and the CIS Different responses to system change While the EU integration process has driven reforms in the Western Balkans, democracy has failed to take hold in Central Asia and unresolved confl icts are brewing in the Southern Caucasus. Money transfers from migrants have eased economic hardship in many locations. However, over the long term, local jobs are needed - particularly for young people. Countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) have progressed at different speeds: some have managed to move towards democracy with transparent elections and peaceful changes of government; others continue to be ruled by more autocratic governments. Corruption remains a major problem. The economic situation is gradually improv-ing even though no long-term jobs have yet been created. In several countries, gross national product (GNP) is still overly reliant on money transfers from migrants. Little progress has been made towards solving certain confl icts that have been simmering for some time. The Republic of Moldova is an exception, where the new government of Transnistria has made overtures for dialogue with Chisinau. It is mainly internally displaced persons (IDPs) that are most affected by confl icts in the Southern Caucasus and Central Asia. In Georgia alone, there are around 200,000 IDPs, many of whom are in need of sup-port. In some parts of Central Asia, as in the South-ern Caucasus, natural disasters have the potential of destroying livelihoods and infrastructure. Swiss transition cooperation activities are focussed on fi ve countries of the Western Balkans and in three regions of the former Soviet Union. Emphasis is placed on promoting the rule of law and democracy as well as on furthering economic and social develop-ment based on market principles and protection of natural resources. Switzerland's new cooperation strategy with Central Asia is focused on Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbeki-stan. Priority is given to health and infrastructure as well as to development of the private sector, the justice system and decentralised public services. In Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, the SDC supports efforts to achieve political stability and SECO encourages ex-ports from various sectors. The SDC's Humanitarian Aid and SHA Domain works on disaster prevention in Tajikistan. Switzerland's new cooperation strategy with the Southern Caucasus is centred on economic devel-opment, creation of jobs, good governance, peace-building and reducing the risk of natural hazards. In the Republic of Moldova, the SDC works to pro- vide greater access to drinking water and healthcare services. In Ukraine, it supports reforms to improve maternal and child health, greater access to decen-tralised public services and effi cient energy manage- ment. In the Western Balkans, the EU integration process has been a driver of change. Serbia managed to se-cure EU candidate status in the spring of 2012 and Albania will possibly follow suit shortly. For their part, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo are still a long way off from this objective. Macedonia still needs to make serious progress towards implement-ing essential reforms before it can initiate accession negotiations with the EU. On a macroeconomic lev-el, the region has remained stable with reasonable growth rates and slightly increasing foreign direct investment. However, this has not been enough to decisively slash unemployment rates, which have af-fected women and young people the most. Unequal access to public services and the conse- quences of high unemployment remain major chal-lenges. The SDC priority themes relating to democ-ratisation, decentralisation and local governance as well as improving the employability of young people are still as important as ever. In the future, greater attention will also be paid to encouraging healthcare reform. Since a strong private sector is important for job creation, SECO will continue to strive for better general conditions for entrepreneurship. Emphasis will be placed on remedying limited access to fi - nance, overcoming regulatory hurdles and improving the macroeconomic environment. In addition, SECO gives considerable importance to ensuring effi cient energy and water supply. Breakdown of the enlargement contribution among the EU 10 by project goal (in %) Economic growth and working conditions Social security EnvironmentPublic safety and security Civil society Project preparation and technical assistance9 39 167 27235Eastern Europe and the CIS Transition support continues to encounter obstacles: in many countries, the public sector needs to undergo major reforms; institutional, fi nancial and technical capacities are limited; there is a lack of transparency; and individual ministries do not really work together. The SDC and SECO maintain constant dialogue with state institutions in an effort to address these issues and set reform processes in motion. With its contribution to EU enlargement, Switzerland has helped to reduce social and economic disparities in a larger European Union since 2008. Despite high-er economic growth rates in the years immediately following accession to the EU, the level of prosper-ity enjoyed by the new EU member states has been relatively low and the gaps with respect to EU-15 member states has widened. Some partner countries were hit hard by the fi nancial and economic crisis and therefore welcome Switzerland's contribution to EU enlargement, which is an expression of solidarity. At the same time, Switzerland's contribution lays the foundation for solid bilateral relations with the new EU member states. Switzerland's contribution is joint-ly implemented by the SDC and SECO, which pursue the following fi ve objectives: 1. Encourage economic growth; 2. Improve social security; 3. Protect the en-vironment; 4. Improve public safety, 5. Strengthen civil society. By June 2012, a total of CHF 1 billion in enlargement contribution funding had been allocat-ed to 210 successfully completed projects in the new member states that joined the EU in 2004 (EU-10). Cooperation initiatives with Bulgaria and Romania (CHF 257 million) were launched in 2010. \"In many countries, the public sector needs to undergo major reforms.\" 35 Finding happiness in one's own village Artak Manucharyan is 27 years old and grew up in Qarahunj (South Armenia). After completing upper-secondary school, he did his military service and then returned to his village. The SDC supports Artak through a livestock-breeding programme in the Syunik Province. After military service, many of my friends went to Russia in search of seasonal work. Many avoided agriculture because it involves hard manual labour for minimal earnings. As for me, I decided to return to my village with my family and see if I could make a living in agriculture. It was my neighbours who told me about a develop- ment programme for cattle farmers. I was particularly interested in the animal purchasing system. In early 2009, following the advice of a project specialist, I bought a cow and two calves. I was able to pay off the debt through the sale of milk - without delay. Thanks to the support I received from the project, I was also able to travel to other farms to study new techniques. This enabled me to learn more about livestock breeding and the benefi ts of artifi cial insem- ination, a technique that I am now using on my own farm. So far, two calves have already been born using artifi cial insemination. And the difference is obvious: calves born from artifi cial insemination produce more milk and more meat. Some of the milk is used for our own needs and the remainder is sold at a profi t to the local milk proces- sor Elola. I now want to expand meat production: I intend to sell bull's meat for New Year's and then buy a cow. I have recently married. We now expect our fi rst child. The project has helped us to remain together as a family. Of course, working on a farm is not easy, but I like what I do. If you plan carefully and work seriously, then it's possible to earn a decent income from livestock breeding. I much rather prefer this to having to live far away from the family and only working a seasonal job. 35Eastern Europe and the CIS Results in 2012 in Eastern Europe and the CIS Eastern Europe/CIS: SECO by themes 2012(in %)Eastern Europe/CIS: SDC by themes 2012(in %) Private sector development Financing of infrastructuresMacroeconomic support Trade promotionHealth EducationAgriculture, water and environment Rule of law, democracy Other (economy and employ- ment/confl ict prevention) Humanitarian aid 36nLocal municipalities in Macedonia describe their SDC-sponsored associa-tion as their most impor-tant cooperation partner. Thanks to a successful representation of local community interestsby the association, 25% of fee income from the hydroelectric power station now fl ows into local municipality ac-counts. nIn Bosnia and Herze- govina, SECO provided funding for the rehabili-tation of parts of the hydroelectric power station in Jablanica. This plant is essential for the country's national power grid. By the end of the project in 2012, power output had increased by 25 Mega-watts to a total of 186 Megawatts. nIn Serbia, the SDC helped to build ten regional teacher train- ing centres, which had provided continu-ing training courses to around 80,000 teachers by 2012. The SDC initiative has already been adopted by two local municipalities, which have allocated their own funding to establish local teacher training centres. nKyrgyzstan received support from SECO in its efforts to counter money launderinginitiatives, Switzerland has helped to integrate internally displaced persons (IDPs) and vic- tims of natural disasters. nIn Azerbaijan, the e-government reform launched in 2011 has led to improvements in the business envi-ronment. Companies have been able to save around CHF 12 million per year. With support from SECO, a website was set up enabling the issuance of business permits as well as the electronic registration of inspections. nIn Tajikistan, the SDC has established an early warning system to protect the population from fl ash fl oods. The precautionary measures devised with the par-ticipation of inhabitants ensure that the popula-tion can be taken to safety and provided with lifesaving supplies if a serious situation arises. nAt the River Theiss in Hungary, Switzerland's contribution to EU en-largement has enabled new hydrogeological data to be used to adapt the country's fl ooding strategy. Two telemetric stations and thirty digital radio systems have con-tributed to the develop-ment of an effective fl ood monitoring system. nIn Slovenia, a primary focus of Switzerland's contribution to EU enlargement has been renewable energies. Among other things, solar panels have been placed on a 600 metre-long noise protection wall built along a sec-tion of the motorway to Italy. These solar panels produce enough electricity for around 46 households. nIn Ukraine, SECO sponsors a programme for homeowners. Thanks to a new fund-ing system, houses are being renovated so that they become more energy effi cient. The costs are covered by the homeowners them-selves (10%), the local communities (30%) and a commercial bank (60%).and terrorism fund- ing. The authorities underwent training to better identify suspi-cious transactions. As a result, Kyrgyzstan was able to bring its prac-tices up to international standards. nSwiss support for healthcare reform in Kyrgyzstan has enabled 95% of the population to gain access to basic services. In the Republic of Moldova, the SDC helped to open four paediatric urgent care centres . These centres now cover all of the country's needs. nSince 2010, an ad- ditional 50,000 persons in Ukraine have gained access to good-quality public services, particu-larly drinking water. In Tajikistan and Uzbeki-stan, where SDC projects are being carried out, waterborne diseases have fallen by 30%. nIn Georgia and Arme- nia, the SDC has worked to build or renovate houses, which has im-proved the living condi-tions of 390 families.

However, the rehabilitation of the water infrastructure was quickly taken care of. Seven regional water companies were soon founded. Initially, I monitored institutional re-forms as head of unit within the Department of Public Utilities under the United Nations Interim Administra-tion Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). Later, I was appoint-ed as Water Department Director within the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning (MESP) of the Republic of Kosovo. Shortly after Kosovo declared its independence in 2008, the government recognised the vital importance of water for socio-economic de-velopment and created a Water Task Force (WTF): this is a high-ranking committee comprised of the heads of four ministries and chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister. It was there that I learnt that SECO intended to provide the WTF with funding as part of its water programme in Kosovo. I applied for and obtained the position of Water Policy Advisor (WPA). My work consists of coordinating a large number of often confl icting approaches, rules and regulations. For example, we are currently working on new wa-ter legislation that addresses aspects of ownership and management. The WTF has helped to bring together important stakeholders - government agencies, donors and local communities. I would now like the government to transform the WTF into a permanent inter-minis-terial water council. I am pleased to see that the sit-uation in the water sector has also improved thanks to SECO's commitment and that the ministries have become more aware of water-related issues. At present, 76% of the population of Kosovo has access to drinking water. However, there are only a few wastewater treatment plants. So, there is still a lot left to do, but I like facing chal-lenges. With my background as an agronomist, I developed extensive expertise in medici- nal plants, herbs and bioproducts. In Albania, there are many such products. However, the right methods have not yet been developed to produce them prop-erly and to full capacity. I realised that I could very easily create a profi table company. And, in 1998 - seven years after the transition from communism to democracy - I founded my own business producing rare plants, herbs and bioproducts. In the beginning I gathered the plants and herbs that were growing in the wild. Later I planted seeds for numerous other plants. A very valuable plant is Mo-narda, which is used in the food industry as well as in cosmetics. Larger companies had tried unsuccessfully to grow and sell these plants. In fact, the production of Monarda is complex. My problem was that I didn't have any buyers yet.Nevertheless, the great potential motivated me to push forward. I received fi nancial support from the sustainable agriculture programme, which I used for equipment purchases, marketing, packaging and training of employees as well as sales contacts. And my efforts were rewarded: I now have a long-term contract with a Swiss importer for the delivery of Monarda. Swiss support allowed me to expand production to include other valuable bioproducts, including Edel-weiss and elderberry. In 2012, I also began producing saffron. I currently export products to Switzerland, Germany and Canada. The greater turnover has ena-bled me to increase employee salaries by 30%. The challenge right now is to increase production with-out reducing quality. After all, quality is what keeps me in business. Better water supply for Kosovo Successful exporter Agim Pudja is an agro-business entrepreneur in Albania.

The quality of education systems in Central Asia, particularly in the poorest countries, is not what it once was. Many young people lack the quali cations to enter and compete in the labour market.40Global challenges Climate change Greater consolidation of climate funding The United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Durban at the end of 2011 led to the somewhat diffi cult launch of the Green Climate Fund (GCF). At the second Meeting of the GCF Board in Korea, it was decided that the GCF would be based in the South Korean town of Songdo in 2014. Switzerland shares a seat with Russia on the GCF Board. The SDC, SECO and the Federal Offi ce for the Environ- ment will coordinate Swiss participation. During an initial phase, the SDC will represent Switzerland on the GCF Board. The SDC's Global Programme Climate Change is ac- tively working on the GCF structure with both na-tional and international partners. However, given the limited progress achieved thus far, it is rather unlikely that the GCF can be funded in 2013. Before the GCF will be able to exert the - hoped for - consolidat-ing infl uence on multilateral climate funding, existing funding mechanisms will need to be extended and redefi ned: the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the World Bank's Climate Investment Funds. n Building from the experiences of an SDC partner organisation, the government of the Indian state of Maharashtra has enacted a decree that en-courages and regulates the use of rainwater har-vesting for agriculture. This measure to adapt to climate change covers 43,000 villages and 10 million farmers. n The Interdepartmental Platform for Renewable Energy and Energy Effi ciency Promotion in Inter- national Cooperation (REPIC) is a joint initiative of the SDC, SECO, the Federal Offi ce for the Environment (FOEN) and the Swiss Federal Offi ce of Energy (SFOE). In Ethiopia, the REPIC helped fund the construction of four of Ethiopia's 14 solar centres. In 2012, these solar centres sold 4,050 solar power systems for lighting and charging of cell phones. n Peru and Switzerland launched a meteorological partnership. The aim for policymakers is to have access to good-quality weather and climate data and improve climate change adjustment capacities in the Andes region. n With Swiss support, China is currently revising its Air Pollution Control Act and is working to develop a national Climate Act. Building from a successful pilot project launched by Switzer-land, China is forming a pool of experts for the \"10,000 Enterprise Pilot Programme\", which encourages more energy-effi cient and resource- saving production methods. n Swiss contributions to the \"Forest Carbon Partnership Facility\" increased by CHF 4.5 million in 2012. So far, nine countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Asia have signed contracts worth a total of USD 64 million with the World Bank for sustainable rainforest management. n The SDC's project to encourage energy effi ciency in brick production in South America was selected by the \"Momentum for Change Initia-tive\" of the United Nations Framework Conven-tion on Climate Change as one of nine pioneer-ing activities and was discussed in Doha in the presence of United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. n In Tunisia, SECO presented twenty companies with analysis of resource-saving production methods. National experts also underwent training and information was provided on sources of funding for climate investment. The international community fi nds it diffi cult to reach global agreements and action plans to fi ght climate change. At the same time, there is increasing pressure from civil society in most countries for greater climate protection. The creation of stronger international funding mechanismsis a top priority. 41Global challenges Water Rising demand, dwindling resources Establishing a reliable supply of clean water is among the main development priorities. Water is crucial in the production of food and energy, in maintaining economic growth, in securing rural livelihoods, in raising the status of women and in preserving eco-systems. The demand for water is constantly rising under the infl uences of population and economic growth. The combined burdens of climate change, greater use of water for food production and water pollution is taking the situation past the breaking point. As water shortages become more frequent, the risk of confl icts increases. The main challenges include fi nding ways to strike the right balance between growing water needs and available water resources; introducing more effi cient water consumption in agriculture; securing urban water supply; distribut-ing water as fairly and effi ciently as possible to com- peting users. n In the area of water diplomacy, Switzerland is seen as a strong and credible partner. In the Middle East, the Blue Peace concept enjoys full support from Iraq, Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon: enabling linkages to be established between sound stewardship of water resources and peacebuilding. n Since 2012, SECO has leveraged infrastruc- ture projects to further business activities in Macedonia. The management capacities of providers of public services have improved, which has led to better quality services for users. So far, a total of 200,000 customers have benefi ted from these activities. n In early 2012, the SDC organised the fi rst General Meeting of the \"Swiss Water Partnership\". This partnership brings public and private stakeholders, NGOs and research-ers together to address water-related issues. Improved coordination should lead to a more effi cient, sustainable and fair management of water resources and provide universal access to drinking water and sanitation facilities. n With SDC support, initial results were achieved through the global project \"Payments for Watershed Services\": alliances were estab- lished with key local partners in six pilot coun-tries and considerable progress was made on the demonstration project portfolio. In 2012, a project was also launched to protect water catchment areas in Peru. n Following successes in Colombia, the SDC decided to expand its water footprint concept to Peru and Chile. In Vietnam, the water foot-print concept was introduced for coffee bean production and offi cially adopted by the Coffee Task Force. n In the town of Chudschand in northern Tajik- istan, SECO helped to rehabilitate the water supply and institutionalise urban water com- panies. Between 2005 and 2012, an additional 165,000 inhabitants were provided with access to drinking water. At the same time, losses along the water supply network were reduced by half.Water is the key to sustainable development and is closely linked to a range of global challenges. Clean water is the key not only to food security but also to health, since many diseases are waterborne in nature. 42According to the Food and Agriculture Organiza- tion's State of Food Insecurity in the World Report 2012, around 870 million people worldwide are chronically undernourished. The vast majority of these people live in developing countries, where the average prevalence of undernutrition stands at 15% of the total population. Between 1990 and 2012, the proportion of undernutrition worldwide fell from 18.6% to 12.5%. However, during the same period, the absolute number of undernourished people in Sub-Saharan Africa increased from 170 million to 234 million people. Likewise, the preva-lence of undernutrition in that region rose to 26.8% of the total population. While the situation in Asia has improved in absolute terms, 60% of the world's chronically undernourished people live in Asia. The fi nancial crisis not only led to cutbacks in public expenditure for development cooperation. It creat-ed speculative interest in soft commodities or land. This factor, combined with drought in the United States and Russia, resulted in a sharp increase and turbulent short-term fl uctuations in food prices. n Switzerland played an active role in the drafting of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsi- ble Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security, which was endorsed by the United Nations Commission on World Food Security in May 2012. Further support will be given for implementation at country level. n Thanks to a strong Swiss commitment, food security and sustainable food systems were recog-nised as key aspects of sustainable development at the United Nations Conference on Sustain- able Development (Rio+20) held in June 2012. n SDC expertise acquired in the area of organic agriculture will be integrated directly in national and regional investment plans in Africa through the Ecological Organic Agriculture Initiative. n The SDC's Global Programme Food Security strengthens linkages between international agricultural research, advisory and education systems and farmers' organisations. As a case in point, a new water irrigation method enables the same quantity of rice to be produced with 30% less water. n Innovative advisory projects, made possible thanks to the widespread use of cell phones in rural areas, offer a very promising alternative to traditional state advisory systems. These projects can potentially reach millions of small-holder farmers. n In Asia, advances in satellite technology have led to more precise crop forecasts for rice produc- tion. These forecasts can then be used as the basis for microinsurance policies covering crop loss to be sold to millions of smallholder farmers.Global challenges Food Security Reducing hunger through responsible governance of the tenure of land Improving food security is not just a matter of fi nding the right farming techniques or securing better-quality fertilisers. Responsible governance of agricultural land, fi sheries and forests is equally important: various water usage interests confl ict with one another. 43 Remittances from migrants abroad and knowledge transfers by migrants returned home are both impor-tant means of reducing poverty and furthering devel-opment in countries of origin. If migrants lose their employment as a result of economic changes - e.g. following the global economic and fi nancial crisis - or as a result of armed confl icts, then the resulting interruption of money transfers has a major impact on social and political developments taking place in their countries of origin. Switzerland remains an important participant in inter- national discussions on migration and development. It has helped to make migration a more prominent theme in the development agenda. As a result, impor-tant migration and development programmes have either been launched or are in the planning stage in North and West Africa, South Asia, the Horn of Af-rica, the Western Balkans and the Middle East. These programmes seek to improve general conditions for labour migrants and strengthen migrant organisations. Efforts will also be made to help these migrants con-tribute more to the development of their countries of origin through money transfers. With preparations un-derway for the post-2015 global development agen-da, Switzerland has initiated a global consultation on the topic of population dynamics. It will leverage this theme to draw even greater attention to correlations between development and migration. The SDC's Hu-manitarian Aid and SHA Domain will also continue to work at the global, regional, national and local levels to protect internally displaced persons (IDPs). n Within the context of labour migration from South Asia and the Middle East, the SDC has helped migrant organisations, lawyers and NGOs to establish interregional networks so that they are in a better position to defend and enforce the rights of migrants. n In West Africa, the SDC provided funding for a handbook describing standards for the protec- tion and reintegration of young migrants. This practical handbook was jointly developed by state and non-state actors and should en-hance the quality of advisory services provided by government authorities and NGOs. It is also intended to improve cooperation between states over the long term. n In the Western Balkans, the SDC has supported migration dialogue with Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as with Kosovo. This has been done to pave the way for a comprehensive solution-oriented migration policy. The vari- ous themes addressed include return and inte-gration, migration and development, prevention of irregular migration and regional cooperation in the area of migration. n In Ghana, SECO has helped to simplify money transfers: through the use of mobile technol-ogy, migrants are now able to make low-cost money transfers to their home provinces. n Thanks to SDC support to the Sri Lankan Minis- try of Labour, labour migrants now have better access to services. In addition, women and men who are interested in leaving their country of origin are provided with better information regarding the opportunities and risks of migration. n In Tunisia, thousands of internally displaced persons in the Shousha camp now have better access to healthcare services. These IDPs had fl ed from the Libyan confl ict. The SDC's Humanitarian Aid Domain and the SHA lend support to IDPs and other persons in need of protection. Global challenges Migration Leveraging migration for development In many developing and transition countries, money transfers from migrants are the main source of currency. And yet not all cases of migration can be described as success stories. Many migrants are among the most vulnerable population groups, requiring both protection and legal advice wherever they are in the world.44SECO lends support to the governments of partner countries so that they can defend their interests in mul-tilateral trade negotiations. The aim is to make it easier for these countries to join the World Trade Organization (WTO), increase their share of international trade, create more favourable general conditions for investment and encourage the transfer of technology. The development of fairer and more effi cient taxation systems is also an essential task. SECO guides and ad-vises partner countries in matters pertaining to fi nancial and budgetary policy and regulation of the fi nancial sec- tor. Through its Financial Sector Reform and Consolida-tion Initiative (FIRST), SECO helps banks and fi nancial regulation bodies in partner countries, thereby improv-ing their ability to respond to crises. Access to fi nancial services for all population segments is a key instrument in the fi ght against poverty. Agricultur- al and microinsurance policies are becoming more com-monplace, offering greater peace of mind for the poor-est population segments in particular. The SDC works at the international level to ensure that microfi nance institutions award credit on the basis of both fi nancial and social criteria. n SECO helped to launch the African Tax Adminis- tration Forum (ATAF), which serves as a platform for the exchange of experiences and best practices as well as a means of facilitating cooperation. In October 2012, the ATAF was offi cially recognised as an international organisation. n The Confederation's Swiss Investment Fund for Emerging Markets (SIFEM) successfully invests in private sector projects in developing and emerging countries. An independent evaluation conducted by SECO in 2012 showed that SIFEM created around 5,700 new jobs per year and helped to maintain over 25,000 existing jobs. n Thanks to SECO funding contributions to the activi- ties of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) (e.g. introduction of pledge registry entries or credit bureaus), a signifi cantly higher number of SMEs in Ghana were provided with access to credit. In this manner, SECO made an important contribution to achieving sustainable economic growth. n With support from SECO, thirteen textile and cloth- ing companies in Tajikistan were able to take part in trade fairs in Turkey and Russia for the second time. At these trade fairs, export contracts worth a total of USD 3.6 million were prepared or signed, which corresponds to 18% of the export volume for this branch. n In the Western Balkans, the IFC and SECO worked together on a business management project. Between 2009 and 2011, twenty-one companies invested over USD 250 million. In 2012, SECO approved a follow-up phase to expand the project to the supraregional level (Western Balkans, Caucasus and Central Asia). n Through the Swiss Import Promotion Programme (SIPPO), SECO lent support to a new company in Macedonia that sells a range of furniture based on elegant multifunctional designs. This company managed to increase its sales by 70%. In 2012, one of its sofa models was also awarded a prize at a furniture trade fair.Global challenges Finance and trade Strengthening the backbone of the economy Finance and trade play a key role in ensuring prosperity, economic growth and - associated - reduction of poverty. SECO helps partner countries develop their international trade activities, introduce more effi cient taxation systems and generate productive investments.

During this time Switzerland has played an active role in multilateral institutions and has helped to face global challenges. It has provid-ed fi nancial contributions to these institutions and is represented on their governing bodies. The SDC and SECO also help to shape the strategies, poli-cies and projects of these institutions, which seek to alleviate poverty and need, overcome crises and fi nd solutions to global challenges. The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) was held in Rio de Janeiro in 2012. This was a landmark event because en-vironmental aspects and climate change were fi nally included as part of a sustainable development agenda. Nevertheless, not enough attention was given to the balancing effects of justice and social development. Switzerland managed to bring issues to the ta- ble that it considers important. It also infl uenced negotiations on matters pertaining to equal oppor-tunities for men and women, sustainable economy, food security, health, labour standards and natural hazards. Through policy dialogue and specifi c actions, Swit- zerland actively works to improve the effectiveness of international organisations. In 2012, for instance, Switzerland supported a joint fund of the World Bank and the United Nations that should make it easier for these two institutions to coordinate their activities on the ground, particularly in fragile contexts. Among other things, Switzerland seeks to encourage devel-opment of the private sector. Switzerland also wishes to strengthen the institution- al capacities of international organisations. It helps them to improve their evaluation activities and ana-lyse their performance potential. Here, Switzerland plays an active role in the Multilateral Organisation Performance Assessment Network (MOPAN). Together with 16 other donor countries, Switzerland weighs the strengths and weaknesses of international organ-isations and leads policy dialogue. In 2012, Switzer-land led MOPAN evaluations in Niger and Honduras. In the area of multilateral humanitarian aid, Swit- zerland seeks solutions to larger-scale humanitarian challenges, which helps to greatly broaden the scope of its humanitarian commitment. As a member of international humanitarian organisations, Switzer-land makes monetary and material contributions and sends in experts to alleviate needs in areas hit by natural disasters or where confl ict is raging. In this manner, Switzerland has helped implement solutions to global challenges such as disaster prevention and reduction of natural hazards. Switzerland's main partners in the area of multilateral humanitarian aid include the International Commit-tee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), the World Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations International Strategy for Dis-aster Reduction (ISDR). As a member of the United Nations, Switzerland actively supports International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and promotes humanitarian principles such as neutrality, independence and impartiality. Within the context of United Nations reforms, Switzerland is part of efforts of the international community to improve coordination of humanitarian activities, improve aid mechanisms at the international, national and local levels and make aid more effective. Switzerland also works with 38 other donor countries to implement Good Humanitarian Donorship principles, which are intended to ensure that aid is provided in the most coherent and coordinated manner possible. Once again in 2012, two-thirds of Switzerland's humanitarian aid budget was devoted to multilateral activities. In order to achieve sustainable development and greater social justice, the agendas for poverty reduction, climate change mitigation and the pursuit of a green economy must converge. This will require strong multilateral institutions. Switzerland contributes to this endeavour. \"In Rio, environ- mental aspects and climate change were nally included as part of a sus- tainable develop- ment agenda.\" n The European Bank for Reconstruction and Devel- opment (EBRD) and SECO launched a programme for fi ve low-income countries in Eastern Europe. The new programme seeks to reform the local capital market and increase the amount of credit granted to SMEs. In 2012, 25 local banks and microfi nance institutions provided credit services to 400-500 companies. n Together with the Offi ce of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Switzerland co-chaired a conference in Geneva to fi nd a lasting solution to the Afghan refugee problem. In doing so, Switzerland underscored its commitment to addressing the largest and longest-standing refugee situation in UNHCR's history and contributed to a solutions strategy that has re-ceived considerable support from the international community. n With support from SECO, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) funded an education project in Paraguay to improve basic mathemati- cal skills in 131 schools. In less than fi ve months, children improved their math skills by around 9%. In 2013, the programme in Paraguay will be expanded to cover more schools. n With SECO support, the African Development Bank (AfDB) and InfraCo Africa funded construc-tion of a wind farm in Cape Verde with a capacity of 26 Megawatts. This should cover 25% of the country's energy needs while lowering production costs by 20%, thereby reducing the country's reliance on oil imports in the future. n In 2012, Switzerland was instrumental in preparing the most important Resolution on development cooperation adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. The Quadrennial Comprehen- sive Policy Review will be negotiated at four-year intervals and will be used to guide development cooperation policies and working principles within the entire United Nations System. In addition, measures to increase the effectiveness of individual agencies and funds were identifi ed. This example illustrates the extent to which the United Nations recognises Swiss expertise and its commitment. n Switzerland is strongly committed to improving the impact of international organisations. In 2012, Switzerland worked with other donor countries to signifi cantly improve the evaluation policies of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women). n At the United Nations Conference on Sustain- able Development (Rio+20) in Brazil, Switzerland and other partners helped to anchor disaster prevention in international humanitarian aid and development cooperation, thereby encouraging a more comprehensive understanding of risk in the area of international cooperation. n In 2012, Switzerland provided support in the do- main of training and job creation to two pio- neering multilateral reports published by UNESCO and the World Bank. The Education for All Global Monitoring Report centered on the issue of how to increase opportunities for a dignifi ed job and a better life, examining, for instance, the role that basic schooling can play. The World Develop- ment Report shed light on the role of the private sector in the creation of jobs and illustrated how jobs can galvanize the development of a country.Multilateral cooperation Results of multilateral cooperation in 2012 SECO: multilateral partners - for sustainable growth and poverty reduction 47Swiss multilateral ODA 2012 (in %) United Nations organisations International Financial Institutions Other international organisations15 5035 4848Multilateral cooperation Alternatives to work in the mines Daniel Kapungwe is 16 years old and lives in the Democratic Republic of Congo. UNICEF supports projects to off er child labourers a way out of the mines. This money has helped child labourers and their families to escape the hazardous working conditions in cop-per mines. UNICEF provides families with a \"Starter Kit\" to develop alternative sources of income. They are provided with fertiliser, a sewing machine or tools and undergo an apprenticeship of several months to learn how to make clothes or repair engines. Switzerland contributes CHF 20 million to UNICEF each year. My parents no longer knew how they were going to feed all of us. So, me and a neighbour's son headed down to the copper mines in Likasi (Democratic Republic of Congo) and began to work there on a daily basis. I sifted through stones from morning till nightfall. Soon I began hauling 30 kg sacks down the mine hill to the sifters working in the stream and then carried the cleaned material to the nearest merchant. We used hoes to hack at the ground, laid the copper cable, made a human chain, and carried sack after sack to the surface. It was pitch black, dusty and hot down there. As time went by, more and more people would pass out and we started coming across more and more human bones. Nobody checked the tunnels and nobody counted the dead. I was really scared. The only way to feel better was to place dried cannabis leaves in your shoes, which were rubbed with oil beforehand so that the drug could seep through the skin. And suddenly you had the feeling that you were back in the village, only you just didn't know which one. Everything then felt fi ne and so we kept prospect- ing. My longest uninterrupted job lasted a week. On a good day, I was able to make 9,000 Congolese francs (CHF 7.5) and on a bad one 2,500 francs (CHF 2). You had to pay for everything: for the man who pumps oxygen into the hole; for drinking water and food; and for the cannabis and alcohol after work. At some point, my parents managed to obtain help from an NGO, which showed us how to grow our own food and generate other minor sources of income. I am now in grade 6 of lower-secondary school. I am the third best pupil in a class of 46 classmates. After receiving my school-leaving certifi - cate, I want to continue studying: construction, stat-ics and architecture. I want to build my own mining works - solid, safe, big. I want to be a part of efforts to ensure that my country's great wealth is more evenly distributed among the Congolese population rather than remaining in the hands of only a few. 4849Swiss partnerships International cooperation is not just the SDC and SECO Close cooperation is the only means of addressing poverty and inequalities as well as global challenges such as climate change or the preservation of global public goods. The public sector, civil society, the private sector and the researcher community all complement one another. An overview. Partnerships with Swiss partners outside the Federal Administration are a key pillar of international coop-eration. This is why the Federal Council and the Swiss Parliament give strategic importance to partnerships with non-governmental organisations (NGOs), the private sector and research institutes in the Bill on International Cooperation for 2013-2016. Partnerships are not an aim per se, but rather a stra- tegic means for achieving development policy objec-tives. Competences, knowledge and resources are combined to bring about social, economic and politi-cal change. Different competences complement one another and produce common results. NGOs have extensive knowledge and experience in humanitarian aid, development cooperation and cooperation with Eastern Europe and the CIS. They understand the situation on the ground and maintain international networks; they also have easy access to grassroots organisations and are able to intervene at many different levels, and thus complement state in-stitutions. Private companies shape economic and social struc- tures and developments. It is crucial for social, en-vironmental and economic sustainability to make use of private sector expertise and to adapt business models, markets and supply chains. Swiss interna-tional cooperation partnerships with the private sec-tor lead to the productive exchange of knowledge and the development of innovations. They also con-tribute to reducing poverty. Research institutions can deepen existing knowledge and generate new knowledge. This knowledge is vi-tal in gaining a clearer understanding of global and local development challenges and fi nding adequate solutions.Swiss cantons and communes have practical compe- tences in the area of decentralisation, local govern-ance and the provision of public services. These com-petences are valuable in the strengthening of basic services or of local governance systems. Partnerships are challenging. They involve negotia- tions and require participants to continuously adapt their competences in response to new challenges. In 2012, the SDC led negotiations on programme con-tributions to Swiss NGOs for 2013-2016. Emphasis was placed on enhancing the effectiveness of pro-grammes and improving the exchange of knowledge and experience. These programme contributions are not just funds disbursed, but rather investments in the competences of these NGOs and the substance of their programmes, in view of achieving the objec-tives of Swiss international cooperation. SDC: Facts and gures SECO: About us Restructuring process complete At the end of 2012, the SDC reached the end of an over-four-year restructuring process. The most important measures taken included the following: placing greater emphasis on achieving re-sults from its activities; streamlining of the organi-sational structure; allocating roles more clearly between SDC Headquarters and fi eld offi ces; and greater decen- tralisation of tasks to fi eld offi ces in partner countries. SECO also underwent re- structuring in 2012: amongst other adjustments a new \"Countries and Global Port-folio\" unit was created. This was done to facilitate man-agement of country portfo-lios and fi eld offi ces in the South and in the East. In addition, the newly formed \"Policy and Quality\" section will focus on aspects pertain-ing to policy and strategy as well as quality control and administration of fi nances. The SDC and SECO now have the organisational, operational and fi nancial management tools needed to effectively implement the Federal Council Dispatch for 2013-2016.The SDC and SECO at a glance The SDC and SECO at a glance State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) SECO is part of the Federal Department of Eco- nomic Affairs, Education and Research (EAER). SECO's Economic Cooperation and Development Division designs and implements economic and trade policy measures with selected advanced developing and transition countries. It also works with new EU member states (Swiss con-tribution to EU enlargement). The main priority of SECO's Economic Cooperation and Development Division is the promotion of eco- nomically, environmentally and socially sustain-able growth, which creates new jobs, encourages greater productivity and helps to reduce poverty, ine-quality and global risks. The division also coordinates Swiss relations with the World Bank Group, regional development banks and United Nations economic in-stitutions. In order to help partner countries become a part of the global economy and make them more competitive, the activities of the division are focussed on strengthening economic and fi nancial policy, expanding urban infrastructure and supply, supporting the private sector and entrepreneurship, encouraging sustainable trade and providing stimu-lus for climate-friendly growth. SECO is run by State Secretary Marie-Gabrielle Ineichen-Fleisch. In 2012, SECO's Economic Coop-eration and Development Division had 87 employees both in Switzerland and abroad and spent CHF 300 million. This division is run by Ambassador Beatrice Maser.Swiss Agency for Develop- ment and Cooperation (SDC) The Swiss Agency for Development and Coop- eration (SDC) is part of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA). Its activities cover the following areas: Regional Cooperation helps people and organisa- tions in their own efforts to overcome poverty and development challenges in priority countries in Af-rica, Asia and Latin America. Regional development banks are important partners. Global Cooperation enables Switzerland to lend material and fi nancial support to United Nations institutions, international fi nancial institutions (i.e. World Bank, regional development banks) and global networks. Through its global programmes, the SDC helps to face global risks such as climate change, food and water shortages and migration, all of which severely affect the development prospects of poor countries. Humanitarian aid saves lives and alleviates suffering in the wake of natural disasters and armed confl ict. The SDC's Humanitarian Aid and SHA Domain seeks to help victims of crises and confl icts through emer- gency relief and reconstruction as well as through preventive action. Cooperation with Eastern Europe and the Com- monwealth of Independent States (CIS) is in- tended to support political and economic reform processes in the West Balkans, the Caucasus region and Central Asia. Support is also provided to new EU member states as part of Switzerland's contribution to EU enlargement. The SDC employs around 1,600 people in Switzer- land and abroad. In 2012, the SDC's budget stood at CHF 2 billion. Ambassador Martin Dahinden serves as SDC Director-General. 5051 Youth - Potential and Challenge for Development They challenge the political and social systems; they provide the major part of the labour force; they have new courage and new ideas: youth the world over are a key factor in development. And yet, in many countries in the South and East, the degree to w hich they can develop their potential is limited. There is an insuffi cient number of jobs available, too restricted an off er of professional-training opportunities, and too little space for them to have their say in shaping policy and society. The lack of job prospects and of hope for a better future give rise to frustration and are a breeding ground for confl icts. Fostering a pro-youth society has become all the more crucial. Switzerland's international cooperation is there to support its partner countries.

These rules define the activities and the contributions that are ODA-eligible and are being periodically adapted and updated. - Swiss ODA contributions contain mainly the SDC and SECO budgets, the two organs which are commissioned to execute the Federal Act on International Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid and the Federal Act on the cooperation with Eastern European countries. Other federal offices as well as 25 cantons and about 200 municipalities also participate in Switzerland's international cooperation. In conformity with DAC's reporting rules, Switzerland also declares since 2004 bilateral debt relief measures (within the framework of the Paris Club) as well as the costs for the assistance to asylum seekers from developing countries during their first year of stay in Switzerland. Technical notes - Not all annual SDC and SECO expenditures that appear in the Confederation account are auto- matically reproduced in the ODA statistics. Certain statistical adjustments are made in order to comply with the international directives (not included are disbursements intended for countries that are not on the DAC List, different notification practice for specific multilateral contributions). - The financial involvement of the SDC and SECO in the enlargement of the European Union (EU) is not reflected in detail in this booklet.

In 2012 it was CHF 126 million above the 2011 level ( +4.7%). This increase was mainly due to the additional funds allo- cated to SDC and SECO following the Parliament's decision to gradually scale up ODA to reach the target of 0.5% of gross national income (GNI) by 2015, as well as higher costs for the stay of asylum seekers in Switzerland. This growth was off- set by lower debt relief operations and a decrease of multilateral contributions. In 2012, expressed as a percentage of GNI, ODA was maintained at 0.45%.6Swiss official development assistance (ODA) Graph 1 Switzerland's performance compared with other countries 2012 (ODA as % of GNI) 1.1 1.00.90.8 0.7 0.60.50.40.30.20.1 0 Preliminary data published by OECD / DAC 3 April 2013 for all DAC countries.Luxembourg Sweden Norway Denemark Netherlands United Kingdom Finland Ireland Belgium Switzerland France Germany1.00 0.99 0.93 0.84 0.71 0.56 0.53 0.48 0.47 OECD's Development Assistance Committee ( DAC ) show that net ODA of the 24 member countries dropped for the second year in a row ( -4.0% in real terms ).

Swiss bilateral ODA is principally intended for low-income countries and regions and fragile states. In 2012, Africa and Asia were the main recipients (35% of bilateral ODA in 2012). Developing and transition countries in Latin America and Europe absorbed together 13% of total bilateral ODA. The bilateral ODA amount not geographically distributed amalgamates SDC's pro- gramme contributions to Swiss NGOs and to the ICRC (6%), costs for the assistance to asylum seekers during their first year of stay (27%), contributions to research or train- ing institutes, mandates for thematic advice, as well as operating costs and logistics in Switzerland (19 %).\u00a2 Africa \u00a2 Latin America \u00a2 Asia \u00a2 Europe \u00a2 Programme contributions to Swiss NGOs and ICRC \u00a2 Costs for asylum seekers in Switzerland \u00a2 Other contributions not distributed by continent19 19 16 276 7 612Swiss official development assistance (ODA) Table 3 Geographical breakdown of bilateral ODA by continents and countries 2011-2012 (mil.

See details: www.sdc.admin.ch/en/Home/About_SDC/Facts_and_figures/ODA/Multilateral_ODA15Table 4 Swiss multilateral ODA by organisations 2011-2012 (mil. CHF) Multilateral ODA includes general contributions paid by SDC and other federal offices to interna- tional development institutions. Contributions to international non-governmental organisations (including the ICRC) are included in bilateral ODA. Multilateral cooperation has three pillars: As in previous years, the international financial institu- tions (IFI) were the main recipients of multilater - al ODA in 2012, but in a lower proportion than in 2011 (50% against 57%). The United Nations agencies and the other international organisations absorbed 35% and 15% of multilateral ODA, re- spectively. Lower contributions to IFIs constituted a gener - al trend in most DAC countries in 2012. Con- tributions to IFIs are registered in ODA at the time of the deposit and not upon encashment of the \"promissory notes\" (sight drafts). This notifica- tion practice explains on one hand the variations which may result from one year to another and on the other hand the differences observed with the state accounts for SDC, where drawings de- riving from prior promissory notes will spread over many years.2012 2011 UN organisations 191.2 175.2 UN Development Programme (UNDP) 54.0 Fund (UNICEF) 20.0 20.0 Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 14.0 13.0 United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) 12.0 - UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) 8.0 13.0 International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) 7.2 7.0 Special programmes of the World Health Organisation (WHO) a5.5 5.5 Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) 5.5 5.5 UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) 5.0 5.0 World Food Programme (WFP) 4.8 2.5 UN Environment Programme (UNEP) 4.1 4.0 Contributions to UN organisations reportable in part in ODA b20.2 25.5 Other UN organisations 6.3 6.2 International Financial Institutions 268.5 342.7 African Development Fund (AfD) c43.3 52.4 Asian Development Fund (AsDF) 13.3 13.3 International Development Association (IDA) c198.4 280.6 Other development funds and banks 13.6 17.6 Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) - recovery d-0.1 -21.2 Other international organisations 82.0 83.3 Global Environment Facility (GEF) 28.5 29.2 Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) 14.0 14.0 Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF) 10.6 10.3 Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD) 8.1 7.3 The Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria 8.0 8.0 International Organisation of La Francophonie (OIF) 5.2 5.8 Other institutions 7.6 8.8 Total multilateral ODA 541.8 601.217 SDC/SECO expenditures18SDC/SECO expenditures Table 5 Overview of SDC/SECO expenditures 2008-2012 (mil.
