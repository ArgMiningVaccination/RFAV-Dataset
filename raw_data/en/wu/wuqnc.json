Unanimedicine is an ancient form of medicine first developed by the Greeks in 460 BC. It then spread throughout the Roman empire by notable scientists such as Galen (201 AD). With the fall of the Roman empire came the decline in unani medicine. It re-emerged later in Iran, where Muslim physicians translated the unani texts into Arabic. While in the middle east, Muslim physicians begin to refine and further develop unani medicine. India was then introduced to unani medicine in the 13th century through the numerous Muslim invasions. Today, unani medicine is practiced mainly in India by Muslim physicians (called \"Hakim\"). Introduction Brought to you by The Nurses and attendants staff we provide for your healthy recovery for bookings Contact Us:- Unaani (in Arabic, Hindustani, Persian, Pashtu, Urdu, etc) means \"Greek\". It derives from the Greek word Ionia, the Greek name of the Asia Minor coastline, from the Arabic word for Greece: \"al-Yunaan\".Hippocrates are the people who freed the medicine from realm of Superstition and Magic and gave it the status of Science.Hippocrates are regarded as the \"Father Of Unani Medicine\" The word \"Unani\" (meaning \"Ionian\") reflects the strong Greek influence to this tradition of medicine, but the origins of the traditional Oriental medicine known as \"Unani - Tibb\" begin with the famous physician, Avicenna. Also known by the name Hakim Abu Ali Abdullah HusaynIbnSina, this physician and naturalist was so advanced in his insights and dedicated to his studies that he mastered a great deal of the medical knowledge of his day when he was barely a teenager. Understanding Avicenna's writings in depth would tax the resources of the greatest intellects of our time. Now Unanipathy has become a part of Indian system of Medicine and India is one of the leading countries so far as its practice is concerned. It is very much similar to our Ayurveda.

The ingredients are mainly herbs and honey. It must be noted that the honey used will be raw and unadulterated, rather than the type found in supermarkets, which is usually heat- treated.A famous and widely used medicinal herb is black cumin (Nigella sativa), also known as Hab Al Baraka in Arabic, which means blessed seed. Black cumin has been cultivated since Assyrian times and it is beneficial for a very long list of ailments. It is widely mixed with other herbs for greater beneficial effect and is said to strengthen the immune system when taken over a period of time. Research has proved that it has the ability to slow the division of cancer cells.

The choices of foods and the manner in which they are prepared are considered to be among the most important issues to consider when choosing a diet to improve or maintain health. Skillful use of warming and cooling spices and herbs contribute heavily to the appropriateness of the meal to correct the root causes of imbalances.Each ingredient in a meal affects the heat or cold balance of the body differently and may also influence factors of the humouralsystem. The tastes, salty, sweet, bitter, pungent, and sour also affect the humoural system, as do various qualities that are more subtle than the five tastes normally considered. The aromas which are given off during the preparation and cooking phase, as well as those emitted during the consumption of the meal, and even some post digestive transformations, contribute to the healing benefit of a well conceived meal. It is in this way that Hippocrates intended physicians to \"make food your medicine\".

From a traditional perspective, the primary agenda for any meal is to benefit from the medicinal quality of food. Any factor which interferes with this agenda degrades the value of the meal inasmuch as nutrition is concerned. Multi tasking does not enhance Digestion-anothr modern habit which had caused a deterioration in the health value of a meal is attempting to combine the experience with that of work, entertainment, or travel. Eating while reading, watching television, driving, or talking on the phone will all detract from the nutritional value of a meal, according to the traditions of Unani-Tibb. I have also observed that when patients engage in these distractions, they not only fail to observe the pleasure and satisfaction of eating, but there is also a tendency to overeat. Brought to you by The Nurses and attendants staff we provide for your healthy recovery for bookings Contact Us:- DIAGNOSIS The diagnosis of diseases in Unani system of medicine is through examination of pulse(nabz), urine(baul) and stool(baraz). This system observes the influence of surroundings and ecological conditions such as air, food, drinks, body movement and repose, psychic movement and repose, sleep and wakefulness and excretion and retention on the state of health. This influence causes a dominance of one of the four humours in every human body. Unani believes that it is this dominance which gives a man his individual habit and complexion i.e his temperament.

Keeping this in mind, hakims advocate 6 methods to keep these humors in balance: Inhalation of pure air. Moderate intake of foods and drinks -- too much or too little of certain foods and drinks can stimulate an imbalance in the proportions of the humors. Proper excretion is necessary. Adequate sleep is needed -- excess or deficiencies can both lead to poor health. Moderate exercise -- can be accomplished through yoga. Mental peace -- can be accomplished through meditation.

Diet-o-therapy (hajbilghiza)- this covers a normal diet, liquid diet for flushing out the system, and a semi-solid diet that will allow the digestive system a rest without resorting to the comparative extreme of a liquid diet. Pharmacotherapy (haj bid dawa) - the prescription of medicines derived from animal, mineral or plant sources.Most of the drugs are of herbal origin. These are prepared such that there are no side- effects. Surgery (jarahat) - this includes venesection, cupping, leeching and cauterization.

These factors are: air, food and drink, physical activity and rest, mental activity and repose, sleeping habits, and retention & evacuation.
