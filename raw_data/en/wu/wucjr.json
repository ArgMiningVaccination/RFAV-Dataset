Dao Yin is a form of exercise combining physical movements, mental focus, and breathing originated in ancient China. In this review, we introduce the history in the development and the scope of Dao Yin, the relationship between Dao Yin with Taoist culture and Qigong, and the potential mechanisms of how Dao Yin promotes health and alleviate illnesses. Empirical research studies using Dao Yin for treatment of lumbar spondylosis, peripheral musculoskeletal diseases, cervical spondylosis, heart diseases, central nervous system disorders, immunological dysfunction, and psychological disorders are detailed. 1.Introduction ChineseDao Yin()exercisehasbeenwidely appliedto medical treatment and health preservation since ancienttimes, and it is also acknowledged as an eective traditionalorthopaedictherapybybothancientandmoderntraditional Chinesemedicine.\"Dao\"()meanstoguide qi,theinternal vital energy of the body, so as to create an internal balance, and \"Yin\" () means to stretch the body so as to flexibility [1]. f+_hrough physical movements,practicingDaoYinexercisecancreatetheharmonyof qiand improving health and accelerating the recovery oflimb function. Dao Yin is a kind of body exercise that in-volvesbreathing,massagingthroughstretchingandtwistingarmsandlegs,andmentalfocuswhichacttogethertodirectthe flow of qi[2-5]. Dao Yin exercise has a broad and a narrow meaning. In the broad sense, any active Chinese exercise theory ormethod that aims to achieve the \"harmony between theinternal direction of vital energy and the external stretchingof the body\" can be considered as a form of \"Dao Yin ex-ercise.\"f+_hiscanbepracticedthroughTuNa(expirationandinspiration), body stretching, massaging, Lian Dan (inneralchemy), Zuo Chan (sitting in meditation), inward con-templation, and so on. f+_hese methods are habitually cate-gorized into \"Dao Yin\" and \"Xing Qi (promoting the circulation of qi)\" in line with the traditional standards in ancient times. Both \"Dao Yin\" and \"Xing Qi\" take the cultivation of essence (the fundamental substance whichmaintains the functioning of the body), qi,and spirits as their core, but they require dierent proportions of thesethree elements. Laying a foundation for the so-called \"staticexercise\" developed by later generations, Xing Qi is mainlybased on breathing exercises aided by body and mentaltraining. In contrast, as the forerunner of the so-called\"dynamic exercise\" developedby later generations,Dao Yincenters on body exercise supplemented by breathing and mentaltraining,whichisconsideredas\"DaoYinexercise\"in its narrow sense. f+_he objective of this research, especially inits discussion of therapeutic eects of Dao Yin exercise,refers to Dao Yin exercise in its narrow sense, that is,Hindawi Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Volume 2019, Article ID 3705120, 11 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/3705120\"dynamic exercise\" mainly based on body movements aided bybreathingandmentaladjustments.f+_hus,DaoYinexercise hereinafter can be extended to traditional Qi Gong (),health Qi Gong, and traditional martial arts represented byTai Ji Quan with health-preservation eects and so on. 2.Origin of Dao Yin Exercise As the most indigenous health-preservation method inChina,DaoYinexercisecanbetracedbacktoancienttimes(about 2146 BC). In that era, as recorded in L\u00a8u's Spring and AutumnAnnals \u00b7\u00a8T_heOldTunes,\"whenthetribeofTaoTang began to govern the world, Yin (here \"Yin\" refers to theopposite of Yang) was blocked and stagnant, the watercourses were silted and there was a huge flood. As a result,peopleweredepressedandtheirbonesandmusclesbeganto atrophy. f+_herefore, grand dance was created to reinvigorate the bones and muscles of people.\" In other words, a kind ofdance was created to let patients move their limbs so as topromote the flow of their qiand blood as well as to rein- vigorate their bones and muscles, which is exactly theoriginal of \"Dao Yin.\" f+_he term \"Dao Yin\" in Zhuangzi: Chapter 15 Rigid and Arrogant [6]\u2014\"Hung,pung;gruntingandgroaning;expellingtheold breath and taking in the new; undertaking physicalexercise like a bear or a bird to preserve the body and soul;longlifehissoleconcern:thisiswhatisapproved,thisisthe Tao of the scholar who infuses his self with breath, feeding his body, hoping to live as long as Peng Zu.\" It is believedthat long life can be achieved through physical exercise byimitatingthelimbmovementsofanimals,suchasabearorabird, meanwhile with the aid of Tu Na. Compared withgeneral physical activities, Dao Yin has its special features.AsstatedinXuanJianDaoYinexercise[7],whichisthe36 th volumeof YunJiQiQian,ananthologyofthe TaoistCanon\", \"Dao Yin must follow the principle of peace; head must beraised slowly and the body must be stretched rhythmically.f+_hat is to say, when practicing Dao Yin, one is supposed to keep himself peaceful, and all the physical movements should be performed with a moderate rhythm [1]. During the Qin and Han Dynasties (221 BC-220 AD), the continuous development of traditional Chinese medi-cine brings about further progress in Dao Yin exercise.According to Synopsis of Prescriptions of the Golden Chamber by Zhang [8], \"one should carefully protect one's body resistance and avoid the attack of climatic pathogenicfactors. Otherwise, channels and collaterals will be violatedand health endangered. In case pathogenic factors haveinvaded the channels and collaterals, medical treatment should be given in time to stop the transmission of path- ogenic factors into the viscera and bowels. If there isheavinessanduneasinessintheextremities,DaoYin,TuNa,acupuncture, and ointment rubbing should be practiced toclearthenineorices.\"[8]Here,DaoYinisjuxtaposedwithTu Na, which coincides exactly with the advocation of\"hung, pung; grunting and groaning; expelling the oldbreathandtakinginthenew;undertakingphysicalexerciseslike a bear or a bird to preserve the body and soul\" inZhuangzi:Chapter15RigidandArrogant [6],suggestingthatDao Yin should be practiced together with breathing ex-ercise and can yield signicant influence on man's channelsandcollaterals.Furthermore,itisalsopointedoutin Central TreasuryCanon [9]byHua(alegendarydoctorattheendof the Han Dynasty), \"practicing Dao Yin could drive outpathogenic factors in one's joints\"; \"if one does not practice Dao Yin when he or she should, pathogenic factors will invadehisorherjoints,resultinginincurablepain.\"AncientChinese doctors in the Han Dynasty began to have a morecomprehensive understanding of therapeutic eects of DaoYinexerciseondiseases,whichleadtoabroaderrangeofitsapplication to the medical eld. f+_heSuiandTangDynasties(581AD-907AD)witnessed the advent of the four classics of traditional Chinese med-icine, among which General Treaties on Causes and Mani- festations of All Diseases has the greatest influence on later generations. After sorting out and categorizing the Dao Yin methods recorded in this book, Dai Jin-gang in his doctoral dissertation has named these Dao Yin methods, concludedtheir functions, explained their movements, and elucidatedtheir principles. According to his research results, General TreatiesonCausesandManifestationsofAllDiseases consists of a total of 50 volumes, expounding on 1739 syndromes,which fall into 71 types of internal medicine, surgery, gy-naecology, and paediatrics, providing all together 287 DaoYin methods for specic treatment of some syndromes. Inthis book, thehealth-preservation Dao Yin therapies for thetreatment of dierent syndromes can be regarded as theearliest exercise prescription in the world [10]. In summary, Dao Yin exercise has prevailed in the traditional Chinese medical eld for thousands of years.Accordingtorelatedrecordsinancientbooksandliterature,Dao Yin exercise is a unique system of health-preservationand disease-treatment methods with specic contents andfunctions, cultivated in the profound and time-honouredculturalsoiloftheChinesenation[1].Dierentfromgeneralphysical exercise, Dao Yin exercise integrates the body withbreathing, mental focus, and emotional regulation; it is notstrenuous but requires the control of rhythm and temper-ament, which aims to promote health, prevent disease, and treat illness by actively practicing this exercise. 3.RelationsofDaoYinExercisewiththeTaoist Culture and Qi Gong 3.1. Dao Yin Exercise and Taoist Culture. As dened by Ci Yuan(the earliest modern encyclopaedic Chinese phrase dictionary), \"Dao Yin\" refers to \"a Taoist health care technique, which aims to enrich qiand blood as well as relieve the body by doing breathing exercise, raising thebody up and stooping down, and bending and stretchinglimbs.\" [11]. In Ci Hai(a large-scale dictionary Mandarin Chinese), \"Dao Yin\" isdenedas\"anancientChinesemethodforhealthpromotionand disease treatment,\" which is also referred to as \"TaoistYin\" [12]. It is thus clear that Dao Yin exercise has a closeconnection with the Taoist culture. From a Taoist point ofview, Tao is everything (\"From Tao there comes one. Fromone there comes two. From two there comes three. From2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicinethreethere comeseverything\"[13]),and everythingistaken as a whole characterized by interconnection, in-terdependence,andconstantchange.f+_hisTaoistphilosophyhas a direct impact on the theoretical framework of Inner CanonoftheYellowEmperor [14](oneofthefourclassicsof traditional Chinese medicine as mentioned hereinabove), manifested by its statement \"as the heaven has sun and moon, man has two eyes; as the earth has nine regions(according to ancient Chinese territory division), man hasnineorices;asayearhasfourseasons,manhasfourlimbs;as music has ve notes (according to traditional Chinesemusicology), man has the ve internal organs (heart, liver,spleen,lungsandkidneys);astheheavenhassixterms,manhas the six hollow organs (gallbladder, stomach, large in-testine,smallintestine,bladder,andSanJiao),\"\"astheearthhas twelve major rivers (according to ancient Chinese ge-ography),manhas twelveconduitvessels (passagesthrough which vital energy circulates).\" f+_hese descriptions in Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor demonstrate the close con- nection between the macrocosm and the microcosm in the Taoistculture.BasedontheTaoistcosmology,theoriesofthetwoqi(Yin and Yang) and the ve agents (metal, wood, water, re, and earth)were further developed, and an entiresystem of religious doctrines, theories, and methodologieswere also established on thebasis of Taoist concepts such as\"Tao,\" \"Tai Ji\" (great ultimate), \"Liang Yi\" (the two primaryforms, Yin and Yang), and \"Ba Gua\" (the eight symbolsin the Taoist cosmology) [14]. including in line with Tao\" [15], have laid arelatively complete theoretical foundation for the of Dao Yin health-preservation exercise. 3.2.DaoYinExerciseandQiGong. Despiteitslongexistence sinceancienttimes,itisnotuntilmoderntimesthattheterm QiGong(Gong,or\"Kung,\"isoftentranslatedascultivation,work, or exercise) has been widely used to refer to the self-exercise method, which is also a complex system, that aimsto improve the body and mind through the utilization ofconsciousness. In ancient times, there were no less than 30namesforQiGong,suchasTuNa,XingQi,BuQi(infusingqi), Fu Qi (absorbing qi), Dao Yin, Lian Dan, Xiu Tao (cultivating oneself according to the Taoist doctrines), andZuo Chan. Actually, Qi Gong has many forms, and thosemany forms called by the various names hereinabove are dierentsubtypesofQiGongandcanbefurthercategorized intoMassageGong,DaoYinGong,andHealth-PreservationGong,accordingtotheirdierenteectsonhumanbody.Inthe 1950s, due to the vigorous promotion of the famousChinese Qi Gong expert Liu Gui-zhen, the term Qi Gongwas ocially acknowledged by the government [16]. In recent times, some scholars pointed out that the congruence of \"Qi Gong\" and \"Dao Yin exercise.\" For ex-ample, as Guo pointed out inhis Slavery Age, \"what ancient people called Tao (or Dao) Yin is exactly what we call QiGong now [17].\" Qu [18], professor at Beijing University ofChinese Medicine, also holds the same view, arguing thathealthQiGongisthemodernversionofDaoYinexercise.Inherdoctoraldissertationbasedonascrutinyofliteratureandarigorouslogicalanalysis,Wei[19]concludesthat\"DaoYinexercise, Qi Gong, and health Qi Gong are cultural phe- nomena of health preservation in dierent times, andhealth Qi Gong has been a new form of Dao Yin regimen sinceChina's reform and opening up and meanwhile a carrier oftraditional Chinese culture.\" 4.Modern and Contemporary Development of Dao Yin Exercise f+_he periodfromtheOpium Warin1840tothefoundingofthe People's Republic of China in 1949 witnessed a slow down in the development of Chinese Dao Yin exercise, but some achievements were still made. In 1858, the doctorandgovernment ocial Pan Wei nished Arts for Health, a monographonQiGongwhichadvocatesthat,inthefaceofdisease, \"prevention\" is more important than \"treatment,\"andthatQiGongisthemethodfortheformer[20].In1881,Arts for Health was facsimiled and illustrated by Wang f+_he new edition was entitled Illustrated Handbook on Nei Gong (innerexercise),whichelaboratesonthepracticeofdynamicexercise, explains some specic methods, and providescorresponding illustrations [21]. Wu Shang-xian, an expert in external treatment, and Liu and Zhang, who mastered both traditional Chinese and Western medicine, also madecertain contributions to the study of Qi Gong during thisperiod of time [22]. Since the early years of the Republic ofChina(1912-1949),JingZuo(sittinginsilence)waspopularamong the intellectual class. Jiang Wei-qiao's Jing Zuo Handbook byYin Shi Zi (\"YinShi Zi\"istheTaoist monastic name of Jiang Wei-qiao) is a masterpiece on sitting in si-lence. It was also during this period of time that China's QiGong began to spread in Europe [23]. In 1974, China unearthed Pictures of Dao Yin Exercise fromtheMawangduiTombs,ndingouttheearliestChinesehealth-keepingexerciseillustratedby44picturesofmenandwomenpracticinggesturesofDaoYin.Eachillustrationhasa title, which is the name of the corresponding gesture,followed by an explanatory note which often mentions thetherapeutic eect on disease. f+_he Dao Yin exercise illus-trated by these pictures basically falls into four forms,namely, breathing exercise, limb exercise, exercise withequipment, and therapeutic exercise. f+_hese all demonstratehow Chinese people practiced exercise to promote healthmore than two thousand years ago. In1984,overathousandbambooandwoodenslipswere excavated from the Western Han Dynasty Tombs inZhangjiashan, Jiangling, Hubei Province. Among them,there are two medical documents: On Conduit Vessels and OnYin.OnConduitVessels waswritteninclericalscript(an ancient style of calligraphy current in the Han Dynasty) inthree parts: part one talks about how to promote the cir-culationof qi(XingQi)andregulatedailylifeinresponseto dierent seasons; part two introduces gestures and move-ments of Dao Yin; part three discusses how Dao Yin andEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3Xing Qi are connected with health preservation and disease treatment [24]. According to On Yin, Dao Yin exercise has both repetitive movements, which are easy to practice, andserial movements, which requires the performance of var-ious gestures in succession. On Yin also concludes the benecial eects of Dao Yin exercise on 24 parts of the human body [25]. Under the organization and promotion of the Health Qi Gong Management Centre of China's General Administra- tion of Sport, which was established in June 2001, four formsof Qi Gong, namely, Yi Jin Jing (muscle change classic), WuQinXi(ve-animalexercise),LiuZiJue(sixhealingsounds),and Ba Duan Jin (eight silken movements) have been rec-reated and have gained worldwide popularity [23]. In order to adapt more forms of excellent traditional health Qi Gong into versions that are suitable for commonpeople's daily exercise, the Health Qi Gong Management CentreofChina'sGeneralAdministrationofSportstartedto create new forms of health Qi Gong in 2007. Strictly in theform of academic study, ve forms of health Qi Gong,namely, Tai Ji Yang Sheng Zhang (Tai Ji Stick HealthPreservation Exercise), Shi Er Duan Jin (twelve silkenmovements), Dao Yin Health Preservation 12 Methods,Mawangdui Dao Yin Exercise, and Grand Dance, wereeventually created [26]. 5.Potential Mechanism ofDao Yin Exercise on the Body 5.1. Potential Mechanisms from a Traditional Chinese Med-icine Perspective. Traditional Chinese medicine has a close connection with and laid a solid theoretical foundation forDao Yin exercise, whose principles of health preservationand disease treatment are mainly based on theories of tra-ditionalChinesemedicine,thosebeingon\"YingandYang,\"\"qi,\" \"main and collateral channels,\" \"essence, qi, blood, and body fluid,\" etc. Ruholds that practicing Dao Yin exercise will enhance the flexibility of limbs and stretch the movements of the body, thusdredgingtheinnerpassagesthroughwhich qiandblood circulatesoastopromotethecirculationof qi.Inthisway, qi is guided through these passages and inner harmony iscreated, eventually reaching a healthy state characterized bystrong muscles, bones, flexible joints, and smooth circula-tionofqiandblood[5].Basedonscienticresearch,Quand Zheng believed that stretching and relaxing muscles alongthe regular meridians by physical exercise will clear conduitvesselsinthewholebodyandmakethecirculationof qiand blood smooth. Free circulation will dispel pains, which - nally leads to improvement in movement functions [2]. Zhang Guang-de, a famous Chinese Dao Yin expert, categorized principles of health preservation and disease treatment by dierentiating Dao Yin exercise into the\"regulation of breathing\" and the \"regulation of the body.\"f+_he \"regulation of breathing\" Dao Yin exercise emphasizesthe close coordination between movements and abdominalbreathing that is soft, even, deep, and long. Abdominalbreathingwithsuchcharacteristicscanincreasetherangeofcontractionandrelaxationofthediaphragm,bringingaboutbenets such as a massaging of the liver, stomach, spleen,andintestine,toincreasecirculationofbloodandstrengthentheligamentsbetweenthesmoothmusclesoforgans.Duringthis type of breathing, due to the wide range of diaphragmcontraction and relaxation, the diaphragm can be exercisedand strengthened, thus deepening as well as slowing down thebreathingandleadingtothestateofbreathingeconomy. Inthis way,thelungscangetalongerrestaftereachbreath,whichnotonlyhelpstoinhalemorefreshairbutalsomakesthe lungs and respiratory muscles less prone to fatigue,thereby making the ventilatory function thus improved. f+_he \"regulation of body\" exercise has specic parameters: rstly, \"every movement involvesspins.\" During spinning movements, the area of force ap-pliedtothespinnedpartcanbeexpanded,andchannelsandcollaterals in the corresponding part can be stimulated.Secondly, \"relaxation is combined with tension and domi- natesthewholeprocess.\"Mentalrelaxationcanletthebrain rest,dispelalldistractingthoughts,andhelpthelimbsrelax;limb relaxation can increase the number of open musclecapillaries, relax the blood vessel walls, accelerate bloodcirculation,andchangethefunctionalstateofthevasomotorcentre. f+_hirdly, \"joints, ngers, and toes should be exer-cised.\"Rhythmicallymovingthejointsoftheelbowsandthelowerpartoftheknees,thengersandthetoescanpromotethecirculationof qiandbloodintheconduitvesselssoasto achieve lateral balance and treat diseases. Fourthly, \"oneshould maintain soft, slow, coherent, and flexible.\" WhenpracticingDaoYinexercise,oneshouldkeepthemovements soft, slow, coherent, and elastic rather than sti, slack, in- flexible, and disjointed.Such movementscanclear channelsand collaterals, regulate as well as nourish qiand blood, improvefunctionsoftheveinternalorgans,eliminatefoodstagnationandbloodstasis,andnallyachievetheeectsofdisease treatment when one is sick as well as health pres-ervation when one is well [27]. 5.2. Potential Mechanisms from Neuropsychological and Im- munological Perspectives. Studies of mind-body in- terventions may shed light on the mechanisms of Dao Yin'seect on the body. f+_hough various forms and styles of DaoYin have developed throughout the years, we believe thatDao Yin may modulate health through three key mecha-nisms (Figure 1). f+_he rst mechanism works through thebrain, i.e., enhancinginteroception, regulatingthecognitivecontrol network, and modulating emotion processing toboost well-being [28, 29]. In support of this hypothesis,studieshavefoundamodulationeectofmeditationonthe structure and function of the anterior insula and ACC [27-32], key regions involved in interoception. In addition,studies have shown that Tai Chi and Baduanjin, two tra-ditional Dao Yin methods, can signicantly modulate thecognitive control network in both healthy subjects [33] andchronic pain patients [34], as well as the default modenetwork,anetworkassociatedwithself-inferencinginolderadults [35]. f+_he second mechanism is through the attenuation of (HPA) axis reaction to4 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicinestress. Under stress, the amygdala is excited, which leads to the activation of the hypothalamus, which triggers the pi-tuitary gland to which increases blood pressure and bloodsugarlevels,turnsfattyacidsintoenergy,andsuppressestheimmune system. At the same time, stress triggers thesympathetic nervous system to stimulate the adrenal me-dulla to produce catecholamine hormones, such as adren-aline(epinephrine)ornoradrenaline(norepinephrine).f+_hispathway prepares the body for ght or flight actions. f+_hesympathetic nervous system leads to pupillary dilation,increasedheartrateandbloodpressure,bronchialdilatation,and decreased movement of the large intestine. We believe that Dao Yin counteracts many of the stress responses, presumably by activating the parasympathetic nervoussystem, and leads to the \"relaxation response\" 38]. Forinstance, Jin [39] found that the practice of Tai Chi candecrease salivary cortisol concentrations. Compared tobaseline levels, subjects reported less tension, depression,anger, fatigue, confusion, and state anxiety and had also felt more vigorous. Irwin and Olmstead [40] evaluated the ef- fects of Tai Chi on circulating markers of inflammation inolder adults and found that, among those with high IL-6levelsatentry,TaiChiproducedadropinIL-6levelstolevelscomparable to those found in Tai Chi and health educationsubgroups with low IL-6 levels at entry. Meanwhile, IL-6 inthe health education (HE) subgroups remained higher thanthe Tai Chi subgroup with low IL-6 at entry. Decreases indepressivesymptomsinthetwotreatmentgroupscorrelatedwith decreases in IL-6.It is worth noting that the three mechanisms may not function independently but rather interact with each other.For instance, literature suggests that long-term stress may initiatecognitive,aective,andpossiblybiologicalprocesses that increase one's risk for depression and other disorders[41, 42], and inflammation may play an important role inthis process. Specically, neuroinflammatory sensitizationprovoked by stress elicits profound changes in human body[41,42].Asmentionedabove,DaoYinmayreducestressbyfocusing on the internal status of the human body (inter-oception) and enhancing well-being. f+_he hypothalamus,anterior insula, and ACC may be involved in this process[41]. f+_hus, the three mechanisms may work together toimprove and maintain health. 6.Therapeutic Effects of Dao Yin Exercise DaoYinexerciseisaseriesofexercisesthatareverysuitablefor the health preservation of middle-aged and elderlypeople.Itisnotonlyanaerobicexercisebutalsoatreatmentmethod for a variety of diseases. According to the catego-rization of experts in this eld [1], the practice of Dao Yinexercise mainly falls into four forms: mental activities,breathingregulation,limbmovements,andself-massage.Asatraditionalexercisetherapy,DaoYinexerciseintegratesthe above four exercises into a whole. f+_he medical value and therapeutic eects of Dao Yin exercise on various diseases have been fully recognized by doctors for many generations. With constant enrichment,development, and improvement, the combination of DaoYin and modern exercise therapies has been explored inclinical research and applied to the prevention and in-terventionofphysicalandmentalillnesses.Existingresearchinto the therapeutic eects of Dao Yin exercise on (i) Modulates the attention network (ii) Enhances interoceptive experience (iii) Reduces stress boosts well-beingFigure1: Diagram of the interaction of Dao Yin exercise with inflammatory markers and particular brain mechanisms.Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 5cervical diseases, heart disease, central nervous disorders, immunedysfunction,andsoon[7].Asforitsinterventionastreatment of limb joints, lumbar vertebrae, cervical verte-brae, mental illness, and the physique, the research subjectstend to be middle-aged and elderly people, while the re-search results are quite fruitive. As a great amount of re- search has proved the eectiveness of Dao Yin exercise, its philosophy, forms, methods, and therapeutic eects havegradually gained people's recognition. 6.1. \u00a8T_herapeutic Exercise on Lumbar Spondylosis. Lumbar spondylosis is mostly caused by acute or chronic injuries of the spinal column or its surroundingsoft tissues, the degeneration of the lumbar intervertebraldisc,lumbarhyperosteogeny,etc.[43].Clinically,itismainly manifestedbylowbackpain,lumbarmotordisturbance,and pain in waist and lower extremities. Excessive sitting causesthe imbalanced strength of the lumbar joints and muscles;that is, the tense muscles are always tense, while the relaxedmuscles are always relaxed, resulting in poor blood circu-lation and decreased metabolic function. Dao Yin exercisegenerally involves wide stretches to exercise and relaxmuscles.Asprovedbyawealthofresearchresults,practicingDao Yin exercise does have therapeutic eects on the re-habilitation of lumbar spondylosis and the enhancement oflumbar and abdominal strength. According to Qu and Zheng [2], practicing Dao Yin exercise, through its strengthening of muscles of the back,enhances muscle strength and endurance, provides stablesupportforthelumbarvertebrae,stimulatesthenerves,andthereby maintains the stability of the spinal column andprevents low back pain. Baietal.[44]believedthattheWuQinXi,orve-animal exercise, can eectively stretch the spinal column in alldirections.f+_hisis donesothatthemultidus musclecanbeeectively exercised, thereby strengthening the function ofthe multidus muscle, increasing the stability of the spinal column and alleviating low back pain. f+_he research conducted by Ding and Wang [45] shows that practicing Ba Duan Jin, or eight silken movements, enhances the strength of the back and abdominal muscles,thereby signicantly improving lumbar lordosis and sacralinclination. In other words, practicing Ba Duan Jin eec-tivelycontrolsthemovementofthespinalcolumnandpelvisandmaintainstheirstability,therebyrelievinglowbackpainand promoting lumbar activity. Li et al. [46] randomly divided the middle-aged and elderlypatientswithchroniclowbackpainintotwogroups. f+_heexperimentalgroupwastreatedbylettingthempractice standing-position Ba Duan Jin for 12 weeks, while thecontrol group was treated with painkillers. Visual analoguescale (VAS), Oswestry dysfunction index, lumbar lordosis,sacral inclination, and lumbar activity of the patients in thetwo groups before and after the treatment were compared.f+_he results showed that, before the treatment, there was nodierence between the two groups in all the indicators, andthat after the treatment, all the indicators of the two groupswere improved, with more signicant improvement foundin the experimental group (P <0.05 or P<0.01). f+_herefore, it is concluded that standing-position Ba Jin exercisecan improve lumbar lordosis and sacral inclination, therebysignicantly relieving chronic low back pain and improvinglumbar activity. Chen et al. [47] sifted out 60 patients with chronic low back pain from cases that met the selection criteria. f+_hesepatientswereaskedtopracticelumbarDaoYinexercise,andthe clinical eects were assessed by VAS and the JOA(Japanese Orthopaedic Association) scales for spinal cordfunction. After assessing the spinal cord function of thepatients, it was found that practicing lumbar Dao Yin ex-ercisehadletthebackmusclesfullyrelaxandstretch,whichhelpedeliminatethefatigueofthebackmusclesandtrainedthe muscles with load. f+_his eect contributed to the en-hancement of muscle strength and endurance as well as theimprovement of lumbar function. 6.2. \u00a8T_herapeutic Eects of Dao Yin Exercise on Peripheral Musculoskeletal Diseases. People with musculoskeletal dis- eases often do not want to move the area where pain islocated.f+_helackoflimbmotionsleadstodecreasedactivityand flexibility of the joints and even the possibility of in-flammation [48]. Dao Yin exercise is practiced slowly at aconstant speed, mainly involving the movements of thelimbs and requiring a certain amount of exercise. Due to its benets in physicalcoordination improvement [49] and the balance between the limb muscles and muscle groups [49],Dao Yin exercise can be well applied to the treatment ofperipheral musculoskeletal diseases with therapeutic eects. In the article \"Characteristics of Traditional Dao Yin LimbExercisefromtheAngleofJointMotions\"byYouandWang [50], the movement characteristics of Dao Yin ex-erciseisconcludedasthestretchingtrainingofthelimbsandthe isometric contraction of the opposing muscle groups. According to Ru [5], a Dao Yin exerciser stretches the body under the guidance of his or her active consciousness. Such activity stretching the body not only balances the muscle contraction force around the joints of the limbs butalso increases the volume of the limb tissue fluid, thusformingastretch-fluidloop.Suchexercise,ifpracticedforalong term, also brings about benets to the central nervoussystem's ability to regulate and control the muscles, therebyenhancing limb flexibility and physical agility. Chenetal.[51]recruited80patientswithkneearthritis fromthosewhomettheselectioncriteria(aged40-75)andrandomized them into the control group and the experi-mental group; all the patients were treated with the oral administration of \"Yangxue Ruanjian Capsule,\" Chinese herbal fumigation and washing. f+_he experimental groupadditionally practiced a self-created set of Dao Yin exer-cises, including the forms of Pushing Eight Horses For-ward, Up-and-Down Stance, Standing Stance, and HorseStance. f+_he JOA Functional Assessment Scale of KneeJoints and VAS were used to evaluate the eects, and theresultsofthetwogroupsobtainedbystatisticalcomparisonwere signicantly dierent (P <0.01). thattheadditionofDaoYinexercisetoconventionalbasic6 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicinetreatment has signicant therapeutic eects on knee arthritis. In two more recent studies [52, 53], Liu and colleagues compared the eect of Tai Chi, Baduanjin, and cycling inpatients with knee OA and found (1) all three exercises canrelievepainsymptomsandincreaseserumprogrammedcell death protein 1 (PD-1) levels and (2) dierent exercises can modulate both common and unique brain pathways. 6.3. \u00a8T_herapeutic Eects of Dao Yin Exercise on Cervical Spondylosis. f+_here is evidence that cervical spondylosis is becominganincreasinglycommondiseaseamongmoreandmore young people, and that, in the next 50 years, it will bebecome a clinically important disease similar to low backpain.People whowork atthedeskfor longhours have their neckmusclesinalong-termstateoftensionwithoutenough relaxation, resulting in decreased elasticity of the musclesand thereby leading to adhesion. Tissue adhesion irritatesandoppressesthenervesofthespot,whichcausespain.f+_heslow-paced stretching of Dao Yin exercise promotes bloodcirculation, increases blood supply to the neck, and bringsabout benets to nutrition and recovery. f+_here are certainresearch results, indicating the clinical ecacy of Dao Yinexercise on cervical spondylosis. In the controlled trials conducted by Jing et al. [54], 120 patients who were diagnosed with cervical spondylosis and met the trial inclusion criteria were taken as research sub- jects and randomly divided into the control and the ex-perimental groups, each consisting of 60 patients. Bothgroups were treated with spinal manipulation in a lyingposition,whiletheexperimentalgroupadditionallyreceivedDao Yin therapy. f+_he results showed that there was sig-nicant statistical dierence before and after the treatmentof each group and between the two groups after the treat-ment; compared with pure spinal manipulation, its com-bination with Dao Yin exercise yielded more signicantclinical therapeutic eects on cervical spondylosis. Byconductingaprospectivecohortstudy,Zhuetal.[55] researched into the prevention and treatment of cervicalspondylosisbycervical-vertebraDaoYinexerciseandhealtheducation. f+_he so-called cervical-vertebra Dao Yin exercisereferstothemovementsofleftward-rightwardandforward-backward stretching of the cervical vertebra, chestexpanding,andbodystretchingagainstthecervicalvertebra.Healthy software professionals were selected as the researchsubjects.f+_hose intheinterventiongrouppracticedcervical-vertebra Dao Yin exercise and received health education,while the control group received no intervention. Over the course of 3 years, the incidence rates were observed in both groups, with a statistically signicant dierence in the in-cidence rates between the two groups (P <0.01); the risk of cervical spondylosis in the control group was signicantlyhigher than that in the intervention group. By using the random number table, Wang et al. [56] randomlydivided60patientswithcervicalspondylosis,whowere treated in hospital, into the treatment group and thecontrol group, each consisting of 30 patients. f+_hose in thecontrol group were treated with manipulation therapy onceeveryotherday,thatis,3timesaweek,forthreeconsecutiveweeks. In addition to the treatment in the control group,those in the treatment group were further treated withcervical-vertebra Dao Yin exercise twice every day (once inthe morning and once in the evening), 5 days a week forthree consecutive weeks. Signicant improvement was found in the treatment group compared with the control group (P<0.05). 6.4.\u00a8T_herapeuticEectsofDaoYinExerciseonHeartDiseases.Practicing Dao Yin exercise also has positive eects onimproving the cardiovascular and immune functions ofmiddle-aged and elderly women. Based on a scrutiny ofliterature,itisfoundthatdierentformsofDaoYinexerciseproduce dierent curative eects on heart disease. For ex- ample, practicing Liu Zi Jue strengthens the internal functionsofthehumanbody,andintheprocessofbreathingexercise, the potential ability of the viscera can be fullytriggered and mobilized to resist the invasion of illness andpreventcardiovascularandcerebrovasculardiseasethatmayoccur with the increase of people's age [57, 58]. With theslowness and continuity of its movements, practicing WuQinXinotonlyincreasesbloodvolumeofvenousreturnbutalsostrengthensmyocardialcontractilitytoacertaindegree,therebyenhancingthepumpingforceoftheheartinthelongrun[59].AsbothtraditionalChineseandWesternmedicine attaches great importance to kinesitherapy in cardiac re- habilitation, existing research demonstrates that Dao Yinexercise, as a specic form of kinesitherapy in traditionalChinese medicine, produces signicant benets to the re-habilitation of heart disease. In the article \"Clinical Application of Strengthening YangGuidanceintheCardiacRehabilitation\"byLietal.[3],itisbelievedthatDaoYinexercise(referredtoas\"Guidance\"by Li et al.) emphasizes the integration of the dynamic andthe static which aims to regulate one's body, breathing, andmind. f+_hese \"three regulations\" will contribute to the bal- ance of autonomic nerves, relieve the stress of sympathetic nerves, and allow the heart rate, cardiac output, and bloodpressuretohaveamodestadjustment,thusyieldingpositiveeects on the prevention and adjuvant treatment of car-diovascular disease. Itwas proposedthat long-termpracticeof this method could elevate the spirits and emotions of apatient, reduce mental stress, and promote emotionalstability. Xi and Wang [60] took 80 middle-aged and elderly womenastheresearchsubjects,whowererandomlydividedinto the exercise group (n 40, 2 dropout cases) and the control group (n 40 patients); the patients in the exercise group practiced exercise together 3 times a week, one houreachtime,foratotalof20weeks,whilethecontrolgroupdidno physical exercise. Before and after the 20-week experi-ment,eachsubject'scardiovascularfunctionindicators,IgA,IgG, and IgM were tested, respectively. f+_he test resultssuggestedthat,after20weeksofexercise,theexercisegroupshowed dierent degrees of decrease in heart rate (HR),pulsepressure(PP),systolicpressure(SP),diastolicpressure(DP), signicant increase (P<0.05) in stroke volume (SV),Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 7cardiac output (CO), stroke index (SI), and cardiac index (CI),andnonsignicantincrease(P >0.05)intheIgMlevel. After 20 weeks of experiment, the control group showed nosignicant dierence (P>0.05) in all indicators. 6.5.\u00a8T_herapeuticEectsofDaoYinExerciseonCentralNervousSystem Disorders. f+_he central nervous system, which con- sistsofthebrainandthespinalcord,servesasthemajorpartof thehuman nervous system. Information from all partsofthebodyisreceived,integrated,andprocessedbythecentralnervoussystemintodierentcoordinatedactivitiesorstoredin the central nervous system to be the neural basis oflearning and memory [61]. f+_he treatment of motor dys-function caused by central nervous cellular necrosis shouldrstly focus on the functional recovery of central nervouscells. For instance, foot drop in the cases of stroke and cerebral palsy happens due to tibialis anterior palsy and plantarflexioncausedbythelossofvoluntarymovementoftibialis anterior controlled by the brain following the injuryof the contralateral brain motor centre or conduction path[62]. Research conducted by Zhao et al. [63] reveals that the regulation of form, in addition to the regulations of spiritsand breathing in traditional Chinese medicine, requirespatients to concentrate on the performance of specicmovements. In line with the principle of \"skillful use-de-pendence\" to promote the plasticity of the central nervous system, this process brings about greater benets to the functional reorganization of the central nervous system andthe recovery of motor function. Peng Master's thesis \"Clinical Study on Hemiplegia Treatment by Traditional Dao Yin Exercise Combined withModern Kinesitherapy\" [64] suggests that rehabilitationtechniques that integrate traditional Chinese medicine withWestern medicine produce benecial eects on the treat-ment of hemiplegia, especially old hemiplegia, and thetechnique used in traditional Chinese medicine here is DaoYin exercise. Peng Yue believes that reasonable practice of Dao Yin exercise based on specic conditions will help to establish a correct exercise model, thereby preventing andcuring diseases, enhancing physical tness, and acceleratingrehabilitation. During the recovery of brain injury, Dao Yinexercise may soothe nerves, reduce intracranial pressure,and cure edema in the acute phase, and during the chronicconvalescence,itmaycontributetotheformationofcerebralcollateralcirculationaswellasthereestablishmentoffociofexcitation in the central nervous system. f+_hese evidences suggest that Dao Yin exercise has re- markable therapeutic eects on central nervous system disorders, especially hemiplegia and related diseases. Prac- ticing Dao Yin exercise can better develop and functionallyreorganize the central nervous potential, thereby eectivelypromoting recovery. 6.6. \u00a8T_herapeutic Eects of Dao Yin Exercise on Immune Dysfunction. Immunity refers to the physiological balanced state of an organism having an immune system to tell itselffrom unwanted biological invasion and to defend againstantigenic foreign matters through immune responses. Withthe increase in age, middle-aged and elderly people aresubjecttorapiddeclineinimmunefunction,becomingmorelikely to be infected by various pathogens and inflicted withtumoursandimmunediseases.Eectivepracticeofphysicalexercise keeps biological function in a normal state, en- hancescognition,self-care,activity,andotherabilitiesofthe elderly, and improves their quality of life, thus delaying theprocess of aging [65]. f+_hearticle\"EectofHealthQigongMawangduiDaoyin onNKCellofOldandMiddle-agedWomen\"byWangetal.[4] probes into the eect of Dao Yin exercise on improvingimmune function of middle-aged and elderly women. f+_heresearchers believe that long-term regular practice ofMawangduiDaoYinexercisecanalleviatetensioncausedbyautonomic response, and that the decline of autonomicnervous activity can improve cell-mediated immunoregu- lation function as well as increase the quantity and viability of immune cells. Yu and Wang [65] observed the changes of T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of 100 healthymiddle-aged and elderly people before and after their 6-month practice of Wu Qin Xi, a form of health Qi Gong.After 6 months, compared with baseline levels, the malesubjects in the experimental group had signicantly de-creasedCD8+andsignicantlyincreasedtheratioofCD4+/CD8+(P<0.05);themalesubjectsinthecontrolgrouphad signicantly decreased increased the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ (P <0.01). f+_he research results indicate that the 6-month practice of Wu Qin Xi producedpositiveeectsonTlymphocytesintheperipheralblood of middle-aged and elderly people; therefore, suchexercisehasaregulatoryeectontheimmunebalanceofthemiddle-aged and elderly. 6.7. \u00a8T_herapeutic Eects of Dao Yin Exercise on Psychological Illness.Psychotherapy is a form of Dao Yin exercise re- quiring thoughtless awareness during the practice, which isactually an active psychological adjustment exercise. DaoYin exercise attaches importance to mental tranquilizationandproperlanguageinduction,whichallowtheexercisertoadjustemotions,smooththeinternalpathsfor qimovement, and thus return to the normal state with all annoyanceseliminated and all cares forgotten [29]. Furthermore,existing research has demonstrated that traditional ChineseDaoYinexercisesimultaneouslyimprovesthephysiological andpsychologicalfunctionsofthehumanbody,andthatits influences on these two functions are interdependent andmutually restrictive [3]. Lietal.[3]believedthatlong-termactivepracticeofDao Yin exercise can help a patient to adjust the mind, relivespiritual tension, improve emotional stability, and reducepsychological stress, thereby maintaining mental health. Liu et al. [66] selected 80 healthy women as research subjects and conducted a controlled experiment using theSelf-Generate Physiological Coherence System (SPCS). f+_he8 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicinesubjectsweredividedintothecontrolgroup(thosewhohad norecentexercisehabits)andtheexperimentalgroup(thosewho had no recent exercise habits but had begun to learnMawangdui Dao Yin exercise recently), each group con-sisting of 40 subjects. During the experiment, those in thecontrol group had irregular practice of physical exercise, whilethoseintheexperimentalgrouplearnedandpracticed Mawangdui Dao Yin exercise. f+_heir emotional and physi-ological indicators were analysed through the SPCS, andsignicant changes were found in the frequency- and time-domain indicators (mean heart rate, mean-square deviationof normal PR interval, and high frequency power) of theexperimentalgroup.f+_hus,itwasconcludedthatthepracticeof Mawangdui Dao Yin exercise can improve and ease theemotions of middle-aged and elderly women. Ma et al. [67] randomly divided 80 middle-aged and elderly female subjects into the exercise group and the control group, each consisting of 40 subjects. After the experiment started, the subjects in the exercise group wereaggregated and trained in Mawangdui Dao Yin exercisethree times a week, one hour each time, for 20 weeks; thosein the control group did not participate in any group orindividualplannedphysicalexercise.ByapplyingtheProleof Mood States (POMS) Scale [68] and the Self-RatingAnxiety Scale (SAS) [69] questionnaire surveys on thesubjects before and after the 20-week experiment, the re-searchers found signicant dierence (P <0.01) in the ex- ercisegroupwithregardtothesubjects'stress,anger,fatigue,depression, energy, sense of dignity, total scores, average total scores, good-quality average scores, and bad-quality average scores before and after their 20-week exercise. Allthe indicators and scores of the control group showed nosignicant dierence (P>0.05) before and after the experiment. Wan[70]researchedintothephysicalappearance,sense of happiness, sense of sadness, and psychological stress ofthe sophomores at Huaiyin Normal University in JiangsuProvince in a study utilizing the practice of Ba Duan Jin.f+_hroughquestionnairesurveysbeforeandaftertheir8-weekpractice of Ba Duan Jin, Wan found evidence that the practice of Ba Duan Jin played a signicant role in the promotion of students' psychological health. Liuetal.[71]randomlyselected69patientshavingtype 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with symptoms of depressionfrom a community in Beijing and divided them into twogroups. Using the self-rating depression scale (SDS) [72]and the quality-of-life scale for patients with type 2 di-abetes mellitus (DMQLS) [73], the two groups of patientswereassessedwithregardtotheirsymptomsofdepressionandqualityoflifebeforeandaftertheir12-weekpracticeofBaDuanJin.Meanwhile,theirvenousbloodwascollected to test the level of glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1c). As suggested by the research results, long-term regular practice of Ba Duan Jin can eectively relieve the de-pression symptoms of T2DM patients and improve theirquality of life, especially in the aspects of psychology andsense of satisfaction. f+_he results also indicated the benetof having kept the blood glucose of patients at a stablelevel.Zhong et al. [74] selected 74 women with climacteric syndrome as research subjects, whose physical and mentalstates were evaluated by the SCL-90 [75] and Kuppermanindex [76] before and after their 6-month practice of Yi JinJing.Basedonthecomparisonoftheirconditionsbeforeandafterthe6-monthcourse,itwasfoundthatthepracticeofYi Jin Jing can eectively relieve the physical and mental symptoms of menopause. 7.Conclusions Dao Yin exercise is one of the regimens dating back toancient China. f+_hrough breathing exercise, the flexing andstretching of the limbs, and the regulations of the body andconsciousness (i.e., regulating breathing, regulating theform, and regulating the mind), the practice of Dao Yinexercise leads to health preservation, body strengthening,disease prevention, disease treatment, and the developmentofpotentialandlongevity.AsoneoftheeectivetherapiesoftraditionalChinesemedicine,itpromotesthemetabolismofthe human body and facilitates the formation and trans- formation of essence, qi, blood, and body fluid. It also dredges the main and collateral channels, regulates qiand blood, balances Yin and Yang, and improves the immunity of the body. Recent basic science research has shed light onthepotentialmechanisms,andincreasingnumberofclinicaltrials has provided evidence on the eectiveness of Dao Yinon various disorders. f+_hese ndings have provided theempiricalsupportforthedisseminationofDaoYintothosewho can benet from these traditional healing practices.
