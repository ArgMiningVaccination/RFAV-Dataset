Re: Eyelid twitching Submitted by eowc on Sun, 2008-06-29 - 06:13 Besides, since I myself is not an acupuncturist, I really wonder if the same acupuncture mechanism that is to be applied onto other related acupuncture points would be applicable and work in the same way just like what I have explained in my articles in regard of my Risperdal-induced abnormally rapid non-stop twitching eyelids for the other parts of the human body such as arms, legs etc that are having the similar movement and neuromuscular disorders due to dopamine-disturbing side effects of certain modern medications too (by purging the dopamine-disturbing toxins out of the related nerves around the other related problematic body parts and the nervous system, please refer to the web reference included in my posts for those other acupuncture points). After all, there is just my personal opinion about the acupuncture mechanism based on my very own personal views and definitely a great deal of professional advices, consultancies, inquiries and confirmations would need to be obtained from the licensed acupuncturists who are in the actual and proper position to give clarifications and other related explanations to such views and suggestions .Next, please try to understand and take note that other acupuncture points may be located on the other parts of the human body that are either extremely vulnerable (such as near the eyes, ears, neck, head etc) or hardly reachable (such as the back, shoulder etc). Next, this suggested therapy is actually a simple-to-practice and definitely free-of-charge one, and that is why I am greatly inspired to share my experience with others over the net so that they will eventually get such eyelid twitching sickness finally cured like me and the others too. Besides, for the ones who are having such a sickness, especially in such countries like India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and certain countries in the middle east for which there are a greater number of people troubled by such eye-related problem whilst such acupuncture treatment and related physicians are hardly available in these areas, I believe that my articles that account for my healing experience and the suggested self-administered acupuncture therapy will be much more invaluable and useful to them especially in terms of strengthening their eye nerves against a variey of eye diseases. In addition, \"HE GU\" acupuncture point is located on both of the hands of a person. And for my case, my abnormally rapid non-stop eyelid twitching is caused by dopamine-disturbing side effects of Risperdal. I don't know about the cause of your eyelid twitchings, but if one were to apply that acupuncture method on the \"HE GU\" acupuncture point of both of the hands, the healing effect would definitely at least double. So, why not give it a try (I have tried that before as a matter of fact.) And I can tell you that my eye condition now is even better than the one before I get such Tardive Dyskinesia-induced abnormally rapid eyelid twitching in the sense that my eyelids never twitch abnormally anymore ever since I get fully cured through that suggested alternative acupuncture therapy and my eyes rarely get overstrained even after I get to work lots of overtime for my work commitments that involve lots of paperworks and workings in front of a deskstop. Lastly, I wish you a speedy and complete recovery for your eyelid-twitching sickness. Thank you. Have a nice day.

Next, I have found out from the neurosurgeon that such toxin-based Botox injections would just serve to sort of 'half-paralyse' the eyelid muscles to reduce such twitchings without being able to do anything curative to the problematic nerves around the non-stop twitching eye muscles that cause such a problem. Besides, each Botox injection would work for just 3-6 months and after that one would very probably need to get another injection one after another indefinitely in regard of such a treatment to continue to get the similar muscle-paralysing healing effect. Nevertheless, in regard of the Botox injections applied onto the facial muscles, one would very likely develop such undesired side effects like paralysed facial muscles, droopy eyelids (in some cases) etc when one gets such Botox injections over the long-term after quite a number of years.

Formal Therapies From Western Medication For Tardive Dyskinesia Submitted by eowc on Fri, 2008-08-08 - 10:05 In the case of prolonged neuromuscular eyelid twitchings, since it is the dopamine-disturbing substances / other 'contaminating agents' that disturb the eyes nerves and cause all the unwanted twitchings, spasms, tics etc, getting rid of them from the eyes nerves /related nerves around the particular organ having the twitchings would then naturally, reasonably, logically and obviously be the most clear-cut, direct and straightforward way of curing such a neurological / neuromuscular sickness. Unfortunately, in terms of the formal mainstream western medical science (in contrast to such alternative therapies as acupuncture etc), the particular technology of administering direct and effective treatments onto the peripheral nerves around a particular area of muscles having certain neurological movements / neuromuscular disorders (in order to cure them effectively) simply has not yet been found/invented/developed/discovered by the modern medical science of the formal western medication. Next, even such sophisticated medication as Botox injections could only deal with such neuromuscular disorders merely through indirect means of 'interception' by 'half-paralysing' the areas of muscles having the twitchigs (even in the case where the muscles themselves do not have any problems / simply are not the root cause of such twitchings) without being able to deal with the problematic nerves causing all those unwanted twitchings to those muscles. And that's the reason why the recipients of Botox injections would need to get such treatments over and over again when the muscle-paralysing effects of such medications lapse totally (after 3-6 months). Therefore, such an argument actually suggests the main reason why a person troubled with chronic prolonged eye twitching problems would hardly get their problems effectively solved by using such formal therapies as eye drops, vitamin / mineral pills, anti-muscle-spasms injections, medications etc as they simply do not or rather cannot deal directly and effectively with the underlying problematic nerves around the twitching eyes /other muscles & organs that cause all those unwanted twitchings. This is due to the underlying fact that the 'right technology' for the treatment of such neuromuscular disorders simply doesn't exist in the present day western medical science (which covers the those treatments mentioned above). I may appear to sound a little arrogant to you by making that remark, nevertheless, that's simply the truth. In this regard, I was caught in such a predicament / difficult situation too during the initial period when I firstly sought repeated but futile treatments from such formal medical personnel and specialists of the western medication to deal with my Tardive Dyskinesia-induced non-stop eyelid twitching before I finally got it totally cured once and for all through the acupuncture treatment which serve to deal with the root cause of the non-stop eyelid-twitching problem by purging / driving out the dopamine-disturbing substances / other contaminating agents that cause all the non-stop twitchings gradually and eventually out of my body enabling me to get healed in the end. A New Version For The Self-administered Acupuncture Cure Submitted by eowc on Fri, 2008-08-08 - 10:11 A New Version For The Self-administered Acupuncture Cure For Non-stop Persistent Eyelid-twitching Thanks for taking an interest in my posts made in this website. At the same time, I also have received lots of positive feedbacks from my email inbox from other persons (troubled by such annoying non-stop eyelid twitching sickness) giving thanks to me for the curative benefits they experience upon exercising the suggested alternative instrument-aided self-administered acupuncture method. In response to the additional enquiries about the suggested self-administered acupuncture method that these persons have made to me so far through the emails, I thus would like to provide to the intended readers a new version about this acupuncture therapy which contains other extra and more in-depth details as follows : - Well, regarding the 'He Gu' acupuncture point (as shown in the diagram below) I have mentioned in my prior articles for the suggested cure for non-stop eyelid-twitching, its exact location is at the back of the palm of one's right hand, which is 1.5 cm (applicable to the average grown adults only) measured vertically from the point of intersection (that would appear visibly when the fingers are closed loosely together) between the thumb and the forefinger. (Kindly take note that this point is located at a much 'fleshy' instead of a much 'boney' area - perhaps you would need to briefly explore that part of your right hand at the same time to locate that point, and I hope you will understand that the hand structures of each person differ from one another). When the acupuncture point is identified and marked accordingly, you can then re-open your hand , and then what you all can do is to sit down, and at the same time press that onto the surface of that acupuncture point (using just mild force) with any long blunt-pointed object such as toothpick, a normal writing pen (which is out of ink of course) etc against your chin (suggested for convenience purpose) for a continuous 2 hours (during any time in a day), and it's preferably to do that when you are about to go to sleep at night (so that you have more free time to do it). However , if you are eager to find out the very exact location of that particular acupuncture point to further verify the information given above, I would suggest you to seek consultancy from a licensed acupuncturist. In this regard, based on the acupuncturist, the blunt-pointed objects such as normal writing pen (which is out-of-ink of course) etc instructed to me for such self-administred therapy is actually intended as a substitute for the acupuncture needle to deal effectively with the particular acupuncture point. Unlike the other traditional method of acupressure which involves the use of fingers to press and massage the acupuncture points, the use of blunt-pointed object in such a case for the treatment of chronic eyelid-twtiching is actually meant as a 'leverage' to provide an adequately focused and hence a 'reflexology stimulus' that is strong enough to deal more precisely and effectively with that acupuncture point. Whereas, if that acupuncture point is to be treated with fingers, the stimulus effect generated would be very much smaller due to the fact that such pressings and massagings would reasonably not last long enough to provide any reliefs for the chronic eyelid-twitching. Besides, given the larger suface area of the fingers as well as their rounded physical shape (compared to the blunt-pointed objects), a large part of the forces produced from such pressings and massagings would then be reasonably applied onto the related muscles rather than directly onto the intended nerves through the related acupuncture point to deal effectively with such sickness. Please be reminded that a good sleep at night throughout the therapy period is essential for the healing to be effectively done. And a person shouldn't associate oneself again with the underlying causes such as over-straining of the eyes, excessive cafeine intake, allergy/overdosage of certain medication (with muscle spasms side effects) that causes this non-stop eyelid-twitching to the particular person in the first place to avoid a relapse of that sickness, especially after getting cured from it. Please take note that one should continually apply that method in the case where it proves to be effective in dealing with the eyelid twitching problem (after trying it for about 3 days' time). For your reference, I get my eyelid twitching stopped the next day after the acupuncture treatment. But when I stop the treatment for the next few days, the twitchings just come back again. Based on the acupuncturist, the explanation for the relapse is such that if one were to apply just one-off / short-term treatment, it would then only serve to disperse the dopamine-disturbing toxin / other 'contaminating agents' around one's eye nerves enabling the twitching to stop just temporarily (without totally purging such toxins / 'contaminating agents' out of the human body). So, it works just like doing a physiotherapy whereby one should complete the whole course of treatment (in this case, applying that self-administered technique persistently for weeks / a few months) to get the eyelid-twitching sickness totally cured effectively once and for all in the end. Next, the suggested duration of two-hour period/day (continuous non-stop healing process) for that self-administered treatment is just what I have recommended so far to other persons having the similar symptoms based on my very own healing experience from this eyelid-twitching sickness and the others who suffer from it (who eventually get it totally cured). All in all, it would acutally depend on one's healing progress for the eyelid twitching sickness upon applying that suggested self-administered acupuncture method.

Related References : Diagram of The 'He Gu' Acupuncture Point : Medical References For The 'He Gu' Acupuncture Point : How Do I Know That I'm Pressing On The Right Point ? Submitted by eowc on Sat, 2008-10-11 - 00:20 The information as follows is added accordingly in response to further additional feedbacks and enquiries made ever-increasingly by the ones troubled with chronic non-stop rapid eyelid-twitching / eye-blinking problems (especially the medication-induced ones) seeking helps from me through the emails. About the question of how would one know that he / she is applying the blunt-pointed instrument-aided pressure at the right point (the \"He Gu\" acupuncture point - please refer to the diagram added in the related prior post above), well, the nerves of our bodies especially the ones closely adjacent to each other, would tend to interwind, overlap and interconnect among one another. Whilst the 1.5 cm and its location on the wrist as portrayed in the diagram mentioned above for the 'He Gu' acupuncture point is actually a standard measure for the size of the hands of the average grown adults. Next, applying blunt-pointed instrument-aided pressings upon it (or any points around that 'He Gu' acupuncture point area) will actually generate direct stimulations to the other nerves surrounding that pressed point around the wrist area as well, and subsequently, produce a reflexology stimulus / 'qi' that will flow / travel right up to the 'final destinations'( [Acupuncture Point : LI4 He Gu Large Intestine 4](http://www.acuxo.com/meridianPictures.asp?point=LI4&meridian=Large%20Intestine)), which are the peripheral nerves attached to the muscles of the entire face, especially the eyelids to generate the desired healing effects to the intended areas by gradually restoring their bodily chemical balances. In my case and the others, that acupuncture technique actually serves to gradually and eventually drive out the risperdal toxins / other related contaminating substances that disrupt the normal functioning of the dopamine neurotransmitters chemicals of the neurons / nerve cells around our eyelid muscles and cause all those rapid unwanted eyelid-twitching / eye-blinking, totally out of our bodies and enable us to get totally cured once and for all in the end. Lastly, I hope that the information given above will be useful to the intended readers. Thank you. Additional Information From Q & A sessions about Blepharosp Submitted by eowc on Sat, 2009-07-18 - 08:18 Included below are some Q & A sessions between me and another person seeking helps from me for the chronic Blepharospasm and Hemifacial Spasm disorders of her mother living in India. And I hope that the extra information included in the Q & A webpage below will turn out to be useful to you. Thank you. Original Questions - First Session : Dear sir, I'm residing in india->tamil nadu->madurai city. My mother has been suffering HFS for around 9 years.she has the twitching in the right eye and the right corner of her mouth also twitches along and the right side has turned dark. She has been taking medicines for all these years.Now she has used Botox injections for five times within a span of 3 months interval. Relief lasts for only 75 days period and again she needs botox. Surgical methods are not 100% guaranteed and some websites say the patients lose hearing or eyesight. Then i tried some acupunture treatments and my mom feels better now.so i surfed the web that can there be a cure by acupuncture and found your website and its information were helpful. now i have some hope in recovering my mom. Now i would like to clarify certain doubts : 1.Is the backside of the right hand palm the only point to treat or any other points to include.if any please mention it with or without a diagram. 2.How many days of acupuncture treatment needed. 3.Where in the world can i have the best acupuncture treatment.if in india it would be more easier for frequent visits. 4.Is there any diet restrictions that can control the twitching. 5.Can there be 100% cure by acupunture method. 6.Is there any home remedies to control twitching. The answers to the questions will give us a right move towards the cure. Thank You. My Reply : Well, first of all, when you have mentioned, HFS, I belive that you are actually referring to Hemifacial Spasms. For your information, what you have described to me are also the most of the things that I have gone through before 5 years back when I was having the medication / Tardive Dyskinesia-induced Hemifacial Spasm - especially the eyelid-twitching / eye-blinking for countless times in a split second when it got worst (and at the same time, my mouth was badly twisted apart from having the twitchings). Besides, among the numerous others who have sought helps from me to deal with their similar eye-related disorders, well, most of the Hemifacial Spasms disorders are actually caused by the neurological and neuromuscular side effects of certain medications. Well, I have tried Botox as temporary reliefs (3- 6 months' period each) for each therapy session) for my chronic rapid non-stop eyelid-twitching / eye-blinking. However, it's actually not a conclusive solution to the related disorders. Whilst at the same time, I would also like to inform you and the others that the Botox medications are actually composed mainly of Botulinum toxin which are actually medical derivatives from Clostridium botulinum bacterium (which causes botulism) that have been intentionally abused before for the purpose of chemical warfare owing to its intense toxicity. [http://www.answers.com/topic/botox](http://www.answers.com/topic/botox) [http://wcbstv.com/seenon/botox.fda.injections.2.637330.html](http://wcbstv.com/seenon/botox.fda.injections.2.637330.html) [http://www.resource4defectivedrugs.com/topics/botox.html](http://www.resource4defectivedrugs.com/topics/botox.html) In respect of your inquiries, I would gladly like to give you the following details for your further references and clarifications : Excerpt From The Original Question : 1) Is the backside of the right hand palm the only point to treat or any other points to include.if any please mention it with or without a diagram ? My Answer : As to this question, please refer to the diagram below : Besides, there are also other acupuncture points that are related as well as cures for such eye-related problems. However, most of them are actually situated at the vulnerable parts around one's eyes. And hence, my opinion is that those acupuncture points wouldn't not be that suitable for the purpose of self-administered treatments. Apart from that, as far as Hemifacial Spasms disorder is concern (which affects the mouths and other parts of one's face etc), by applying blunt-pointed-object-mild-pressings onto that \"He Gu\" acupuncture point, which is located on the wrist of one's hands (both left and right), it would actually generate a reflexology stimulus around one's entire face (rather than the eyes alone). As such, I believe that it is thus a safe and practical acupuncture point for Hemifacial Spasm disorders, especially the chronic uncontrollable non-stop eyelid-twitching / eye-blinking. And in particular, for self-administered treatments. Excerpt From The Original Question : 2) How many days of acupuncture treatment needed ? My Answer : Well, that would depend on how serious is the Hemifacial Spasm disorders of your mother, especially the rapid eyelid-twitching / eye-blinking problems, as well as how long she has suffered from it right from the very beginning. As such, please refer to the detailed descriptions of the self-administered needleless free-of-charge acupuncture / technique / cure for non-stop persistent rapid eyelid-twitching / eye-blinking as included below : - [http://www.curezone.com/forums/fm.asp?i=1233341#i](http://www.curezone.com/forums/fm.asp?i=1233341#i) Honestly speaking, I obtained tremendous reliefs on the very next day after the acupuncture treatment (my abnormal eyelid-twitchings / eye-blinkings stopped completely). Whilst for the far less serious cases (non-Tardive Dyskinesia cases), most of them would just experience the effects within hours after applying that acupuncture technique. Whilst for the really and extremely serious ones, (the ones who have been suffering really chronically from such disorders for many years, eg. nine years - please refer to the original question above) , it would usually take 5 - 10 days for them to obtain the desired reliefs from that acupuncture technique in the very first place, and then, one would need to continue applying that acupuncture technique consistently and daily (for weeks / a few months' time) in order to get fully-cured once-and-for-all in the end.. Excerpt From The Original Question : 3) Where in the world can i have the best acupuncture treatment.if in india it would be more easier for frequent visits ? My Answer : As a matter of fact, for some reasons my skins are extremely sensitive to the conventional prolonged needle-piercing therapy of acupuncture. And since that therapy is not that suitable for me, the acupuncturist attending to me is kind enough to impart to me a simple needleless acupuncture method (without using needles at all) to enable me to deal with my Hemifacial spasms / rapid eyelid-twitching / eye-blinking problems. And well, since the acupuncture technique can be praciticed on one's own, it's thus a free-of-charge cure. So, given that I'm a part-time social worker working for the health cares of others, i thus feel that it's a part of my vocations to recommend this self-administered needleless acupuncture technique to the ones who need it. As such, please refer to the story behind the suggested self-administered acupuncture technique for abnormally rapid eyelid-twitching / eye-blinking described above [http://www.curezone.com/forums/fm.asp?i=1386471#i](http://www.curezone.com/forums/fm.asp?i=1386471#i) Besides, there are in fact many people all around the world seeking helps from me through emails ever since the beginning of 2008 for their chronic eyelid-twitching / eye-blinking problems, especially the medication-induced ones. Frankly speaking, for those areas like the ones in middle-east, and unfortunately India and the countries surrounding it, there are hardly any acupuncture clinics / treatments available (based on what they have told me). And so, I hope that the self-administered acupuncture technique will be helpful to your mother in totally solving her problems once and for all, just like the numerous others who have totally recovered once-and-for-all from such chronic disorders. Excerpt From The Original Question : 4) Is there any diet restrictions that can control the twitching ? My Answer : Well, there are certainly causes that lead to such muscle twitchings. They could be due to the neurological / neuromuscular side effects of certain medications, excessive caffeine intakes, overstraining of the eyes etc. Naturally, it would be in the best interest of the ones suffering from such disorders to make a clean break with the causes leading to such disorders. However, in the case of medication / Tardive Dyskinesia-induced chronic eyelid-twitching / eye-blinking, a switch to the better and more advanced medications with far lesser Tardive Dyskinesia / Hemifacial Spasms side effects would be quite an option (given that one may still need the related medications to deal with the other related disorders, and in my case, I switch from Risperdal to Seroquel after getting completely cured from the Hemifacial Spasm / chronic rapid non-stop eyelid-twitching / eye-blinking disorders). Excerpt From The Original Question : 5) Can there be 100% cure by acupunture method ? My Answer : Actually, in the case of me and the numerous others who get totally cured once-and-for-all for those disorders through the self-administered acupuncture technique, we have taken MRI, CT-Scannings and other related medical examinations before. And these medical examinations actually show nothing abnormal at all. And in fact, for the medication / Tardive-dyskinesia induced hemifacial spasms / rapid eyelid-twitching / eye-blinking, currently there are no medical examinations that would be able to conclusively and definitely detect and diagnose the interferrences of medications onto the synaptic activities of the neurotransmitter chemicals / neurons that are widely distributed in our miscellaneous bodily nervous systems to the point of muscle spasm / neuromuscular disorders . So, my comment is that, if your mother's medical scenario actually falls into the category that I have described above, well, then I believe that there is quite a good chance that she will get fully recovered once and for all from her disorders through applying that suggested self-administered, free-of-charge, needlleless acupuncture technique consistently and daily. Excerpt From The Original Question : 6) Is there any home remedies to control twitching ? My Answer : Well, that is actually not to my knowledge. Whilst the logic behind the self-administered needleless acupuncture cure is such that, well, since the related muscle-twitchings are caused by certain \"contaminating agents\", such as the undesirable remnants of certain medications that antagonize the normal functionings of the neurotransmitter chemicals (especially dopamine which is responsible for all the human body physical movements), then, getting rid of them from the related nerves around the twitching muscles (eyes / facial muscles) through the acupuncture treatment is thus the most direct and effective way of dealing with such neuromuscular / muscle-twitching disorders and to stop the related muscle twitchings. Original Questions - Second Session : First of all i would like to thank you for your answers.I found your problem being more severe than my mom and really glad that you are fully recovered. The information was very useful. some of the doubts my dad wants to clarify : 1.As you had twitching a countless times in a split second,its more serious than my mothers case,how many days or months did it take to recover completely.This would help me to calculate the recovering time for my mom. 2.Even after cure are you still continuing the acupuncture treatment these days. Thank you. My Reply : Thanks for the feedbacks. As such, I hope that my replies as follows will clear your doubts about the questions you have asked. Excerpt From The Original Question : 1) As you had twitching a countless times in a split second,its more serious than my mothers case,how many days or months did it take to recover completely ? My Answer : Well, actually I suffered from such chronic rapid uncontrollable eyelid-twitching / eye-blinking and other Hemifacial Spasms symptoms (from the Tardive Dyskinesia side effects of certain medications) for about more than one year. And eventually when I was instructed with that self-administered needleless acupuncture technique as a cure for all these neurological / neuromuscular disorders, it actually took me about 2 months' time exercising that acupuncture technique consistently and daily (in my case, 2 continuous hours / day) to enable me to get totally cured once-and-for-all in the end. Remark From The Original Person - Please refer to the Original Question Above : This would help me to calculate the recovering time for my mom My Reply : Honestly speaking, out of so many people seeking helps from me for their similar related disorders of different degrees of severities , well, for the mild and short-term cases (less than 6 months), some of them would totally recover once-and-for-all within weeks. Whilst for the really serious ones, especially those suffering from the like-disorders for many years (eg.nine years as mentioned in the paragraph above), it would certainly take about a few months' time applying that acupuncture technique consistently and daily for a final, complete and once-and-for-all recovery to be achieved in the end. All in all, that would actually depend on the healing progress of the individual people suffering from such disorders. In this regard, based on my personal experience as well as the feedbacks I have received from the ones seeking helps from me, it's such that once that self-administered needleless acupuncture technique is proven to be effective for them in the very first place, exercising them subsequently and consistently would then just serve the next-steps and the other purposes of reducing the muscle twitchings progressively (in terms of the really serious cases), to just prevent the related muscle-twitchings from coming back after the curative effects have taken place for the very first time (just like what me and some othes have experieced), and then, to get such disorders gradually and totally cured (in a realistic and practical way - please refer to my preceding post above) once and for all in the end. Excerpt From The Original Question : 2) Even after cure are you still continuing the acupuncture treatment these days ? My Answer : For your information, for me and the numerous others who have been suffering from the similar disorders, we would not need to exercise that acupuncture technique anymore once we are totally cured once and for all from them. As for my case, I no longer need to exercise that acupuncture technique anymore after I have achieved full and once-and-for-all recovery for the disorders ever since 5 years back. And well, the reasoning behind this is that, there is no relapse at all of such disorders at all ever since I get totally cured once and for all, and given that my pair of eyes are just as normal and healthy as and to any other people (I mean for anyone I meet), I simply need not do anything for those disorders / symptoms that have disappeared completely. Lastly, I would wish a speedy and full recovery for your mother's like-disorders and good luck. He Gu Acupuncture Point- Left or Right Hand ? Does That Matter ? Submitted by eowc on Sat, 2009-10-10 - 06:46 Well, as far as acupuncture treatment is concerned, the nerves of our bodies especially the ones closely adjacent to each other, would tend to interwind, overlap and interconnect among one another. Whilst the 1.5 cm and its location on the wrist as portrayed in the diagram added in my prior post above for the 'He Gu' acupuncture point is actually a standard measure for the size of the hands of the average grown adults. Next, applying blunt-pointed instrument-aided pressings upon it (or any points around that 'He Gu' acupuncture point area - please refer to the diagram added below) will actually generate direct stimulations to the other nerves surrounding that pressed point around the wrist area as well, and subsequently, produce a reflexology stimulus / 'qi' that will flow / travel right up to the 'final destinations' (please refer to the medical references weblink added below), which are the peripheral nerves attached to the muscles of the entire face, especially the eyelids to generate the desired healing effects to the intended areas by gradually restoring their bodily chemical balances. In my case and the others, that acupuncture technique actually serves to gradually and eventually drive out the risperdal toxins / other related contaminating substances that disrupt the normal functioning of the dopamine neurotransmitters chemicals of the neurons / nerve cells around our eyelid muscles and cause all those rapid unwanted eyelid-twitching / eye-blinking, totally out of our bodies and enable us to get totally cured once and for all in the end. Therefore, both the \"He Gu\" acupuncture points on both left and right hands would basically serve the similar purposes in this case. Diagram of The 'He Gu' Acupuncture Point : Medical References For The 'He Gu' Acupuncture Point : honestly speaking, applying that acupuncture technique on the \"He Gu\" acupuncture point of both left and right hands (alternately of course) may double the curative effects. However, the application of the acupuncture technique on the left hand side of the \"He Gu\" acupuncture point (compared to the recommended right-hand-side) is strongly recommended to be done under 2 circumstances : 1 ) One's Blepharospasm condition is really chronic and has been lasting for a couple of years (such as over a year) - and as such, applying the suggested acupuncture technique on the \"He Gu\" acupuncture point of both left and right hands (alternately) may naturally be necessary in this case. 2 ) The \"He Gu\" acupuncture point on the righ hand (which me and the numerous others suffering from the like-illness have been exercising extensively due to its much larger curative effects) has been skin-worn, and hence needs some time for its recovery. So, the left-hand \"He Gu\" acupuncture point will serve as a replacement in this case. And again for your information, during the time me and the others are suffering from such Blepharospasm disorder, we apply the acupuncture technique on the right hand of the \"He Gu' Acupuncture point most of the time due to its larger curative effects (based on empirical observations).

Submitted by eowc on ( [http://silkwise.com/content/viewthread_thread,4243](http://silkwise.com/content/viewthread_thread,4243) ) It's actually called Blepharospasm which is a symptom of involuntary and uncontrollable movements in the muscles around a person's eyes which in turn make them appear like 'blinking non-stop' to other people. In certain cases, this may be caused by myasthenia (muscular weakness) in the eyes organ as a result of stresses, overstraining of the eyes, lacks of sleeps, the serious lacks of certain nutrients / minerals to support the normal functionings / movements of your eyelid muscles etc. Next, in the case whereby no stress, any kinds of infections, overstraining of the eyes etc are involved whilst the eyelids and the entire organs just look superficially normal and ok, and at the same time, the eyelid-twitching / eye-blinking just get 'unexplainedly' from bad to worse from time to time, such medical scenarios could actually be caused by other neuromuscular disorders which are much more complicated. And in terms of such neuromuscular disorders, they may arise as a neurological / Tardive Dyskinesia side effect of certain medications, especially the powerful mind-altering tranquilizers of antipsychotics / neuroleptics, particularly when such medications are over-relied on to the point of sheer abuse.

Re: Twitching Eyelids Submitted by eowc on Tue, 2008-01-01 - 23:46 Non-stop Persistent Eyelid-twitching - My Comments Submitted by eowc on Wed, 2008-01-09 - 11:04 Eyelid twitching, which is lately referred to as Blepharospasm or Myokymia is actually a symptom of involuntary and uncontrollable movements in the muscles around a person's eyes which in turn make them appear like 'blinking non-stop' to other people. Generally, the movements of one's muscle is controlled by the nerves around them that in turn receive signals from the brains which ultimately dictate the variety of 'ways' in which such movements are to be conducted based on a person's will. The causes of such eyelid-twitching symptom in most common cases may just due to short-term stress, over-tiredness, over-straining of one's eyes, occasional anxiety, temporary panic fits and nervousness which in turn can be easily relieved and recover naturally by a good rest, more [relaxation](http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/387431#)and trying to calm oneself down to stop getting anxious, panic and worried and stressful over certain things. In this regard, such phenomena tend to be quite common among certain students and other professionals. However, in the cases of a persistent uncontrollable twitchings of the eyelids which only get aggravated rather than improved over time and last for months and even years, it may just probably imply that the nerves around the eyes organ are simply not 'properly functionable' enough to bring about the desired movements of the muscles based on the mental instructions from the brains of a person. Except for any brain and other eye muscle damages/eye muscle disorders caused by permanent lack of certain nutrients and minerals etc or other irritations to that organ like dry eyes, sore eyes, bacteria infections etc, such a chronic eyelid-twitching sickness may likely be caused by certain disturbances and disorders that affect or weaken the functionality of the nerves around the eyes to bring about the desired movements of this organ based on the person's will. In this regard, the possible reasons of such chronic eyelid-twitching sickness may probably due to the causes as mentioned above which is experienced by a person over a considerably long period of time rather than just temporarily. Apart from that, other likely causes maybe be certain traumas, especially the emotional ones, [allergy](http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/387431#)to or overdosage of certain medications that carry such side effects as muscle spasms, particularly photophobia in the case of eyelid-twitching symptom. In fact, I myself have also been suffering from such a sickness due to allergy and overdosage to such medications like Risperdal and other similar drugs (of which I have stopped taking and replaced with something else so as not to further worsen the eyelid-twitching problem and to prevent a relapse of that sickness after I get healed). As such, I would very much like to share my own genuine personal experience with you over the course of my treatment of such a sickness and I hope that it will somehow be helpful to a certain extent especially to those who have been having the similar experience as mine and I would to emphasize that it again only is meant as a reference material to anyone reading it. For your information, I have been suffering from this sickness in the past few years whereby my eyelids also tend to twitch both continuously and uncontrollably without me being able to do anything to control the twitchings at all. As a result, my eyes would seem like blinking all the while to anyone who looks at me and I totally could not drive, look directly and persistently at the pc or tv screens and most of the times, I simply can't read any books or newspaper properly. And I have sought lots of medical treatments and advices as well as apply various kinds of eye drops, taking various types of vitamins, mineral pills as well as many types of anti-muscle spasm medications from lots of eye specialists, neurosurgeons and psychiatrists (who explain the medical theories mentioned above to me), ENT specialists and other general practitioners, and even have the MRI examinations taken to get my eyes cured , but these efforts turn out to be in vain as they fail to yield any positive results and my eyes still keep on blinking non-stop. Luckily, just about a year after I suffer from such a sickness, I come across an acupuncture expert who studied and observed closely about my problems and then administer a therapy needle on the part of the flesh at the back of the palm which is about 1.5 cm vertically from the point of intersection between my thumb and my forefinger of my right hand (as per attachment in [http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/387431](http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/387431)) to strengthen the weakened and sensitive nerves around my eyes. After that, he just ask me to press (using just mild force) that acupuncture point using such objects like toothpick /normal writing pen or anything with a blunt-pointed end for at least 2 hours a day and then consistently for about 2 months. Having done that persistently based on his order, my eyelid-twitching that makes my eyes blinking all the while just totally recover in time and I can drive, work with the pc screens, watch tv, movies and read as well as work like any other normal persons. For your further information, I have also come across quite a couple of people in my real life annoyed by such an eyelid-twitching problem of different causes and degrees of severity, and accordingly, I just recommend the method as mentioned above to them and within weeks, they just experience significant improvements to their conditions after applying this therapy, and after a few months , they just recover totally from this sickness. . And I hope that by contributing this piece of article to you, it will somehow help you to in at least getting a clue about this sickness. Lastly, I sincerely wish that the ones troubled by such an annoying eyelid-twitching sickness can recover finally from their illness. Thank you.

I have the same problem i also have seizure disoder i was dianosed when i was 25 i am 32 years old now for 8 years i been seizing and my eye has been seizing as well . It happends to many people. i was told by my dr is to stay away from caffine if you have to drink a cola or coffee try the caffine free drinks and coffees or lay off the sugar based drinks in your coffee and colas. the caffine in the colas and coffee and any other kind of drinks that are consumed causes the body to over activate the muscles and it situlates it at a higher in crease. I was told a basic diet works nothing with high starches and carbs that also stresses the body out as well. also lay off chocolate and coco if nessary it also causes the body to over situlate its self . pleanty of sleep works and try a stress free day . The more stress a epilepic and seizure disorder person faces the more stress the body is impacted and the muscles twitch on their own regardless of taking medication or not. The eye twitches for one reason it is over stimulated and loses mucle control. I was told by my dr and my eye dr that the muscles in the eye lose strength as a person gets older. if you have vison problems wear your glasses more or contacts . If you are still worried about the eye twitching call your dr for a vision screening and take your medication. Eye twitching is normal if you have epilepsy or seizures disorder.

Re: Eyelid twitching Submitted by Naneki on Sat, 2008-03-08 - 13:03 Take a look at this website: http://www.askapatient.com/viewrating.asp?drug=20505&name=TOPAMAX There are quite a few Topamax users that report eye twitching. I just started taking Topamax, so far my side effects are mild: soda now tastes flat...can't taste the bubbles, occasional tingling sensation of my face AND twitching of eye. The twitching has become so annoying, it can be mildly painful and I can see it in my visual field; that the next time I see my MD I'm going to ask for a remedy ... Botox to stop the movements. BTW, I do not take Topamax for seizure, rather for migraines and am on the lowest doasge 25 mg a day. I've only experienced one HA since begining treatment and I'm not willing to stop the medication at this time.

Re: Eyelid twitching Submitted by kymmykins on Tue, 2008-06-17 - 13:22 I have JME and was experiencing the right eyelid twitching at small intervals throughout the day after i took keppra.
