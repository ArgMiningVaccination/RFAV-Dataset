I wanted to take some time to provide parents information that I believe may be helpful. Prior to May 2021, the Pfizer vaccine was approved for all those age 16 and older. Here are some details regarding the trial in ages 12-15: Phase 3 trial was completed in 2,260 adolescents (half received placebo, half received the vaccine) The dose and mRNA ingredients are identical to the vaccine already in use for those age 16 years and older It is still a 2 dose series, 21 days apart The vaccine demonstrated 100% efficacy and the most robust antibody response seen in any age group [(1)](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-biontech-announce-positive-topline-results-pivotal) The Pfizer vaccine is currently the only COVID vaccine with EUA for anyone younger than 18 years old in the United States Regarding the choice to vaccinate your adolescent age 12 or older, the data appears to show safety and efficacy of the vaccine, similar to and better than the response in adults. As a clinician I have been carefully watching the reports from the millions of Americans who have already received the two dose Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and I have been closely watching my own patient population here in Hawaii, where up to 60% of the adults in my practice have already received one of the mRNA vaccines. In general, this vaccine has been very well tolerated and safe, with specific side effects that I will say have mostly been minimal, although I have had a few patients who have needed some additional support to manage the side effects. Why are 12-15 year olds being added in so quickly? The first thing to realize is that 12 years old and older is considered adolescence and the immune system at puberty and post-puberty is similar to that of an adult. The vaccine trials for children under the age of 12 years old will take much longer, since the immune system is notably different in pre-puberty children. Why vaccinate a population that has such a low mortality rate? This is a valid question. It is true that the mortality rate of the COVID-19 infection in adolescence is extremely low. A recent study on 576 children hospitalized with the SARS-CoV-2 infection definitively shows a lower hospitalization rate compared with adults. However, children aged 12-17 years old accounted for 42% of the hospital admissions, reflecting potentially more severe illness in adolescents [(2)](https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n385). Additionally, the long-term consequences of the infection might still be something of a problem for this age group. It has to do with the fact that at puberty the immune system goes through specific hormonally-induced changes. Prepubertal children are more resistant to severe infections from viral, bacterial, and other diseases [(3)](https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/full/10.2217/fmb-2018-0221). Once our immune system changes, we are more prone to long-term health consequences from disease. As an example, I see this often with teenagers who get infected with Epstein-Barr Virus, the virus that causes mononucleosis. Many individuals will show consistent health struggles on and off following this infection. The status of post-covid syndrome or \"long-haulers\" is appearing to be similar in nature. Meaning, the viral disease may not kill you but it may significantly alter your health metrics for an unknown amount of time. I have multiple patients who have been dealing with post-covid syndrome over the past year and it has been debilitating in some ways for these patients. As adults who have experienced illnesses as a child and felt that they have \"never been well since\", we can understand these things. It is true that our bodies are amazing at healing and our natural immune system should be at its peak the younger and healthier we are. However, survival is not the only metric of health and the idea behind the vaccine in this population includes prevention of the long-term sequelae [(4)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mis-c-in-kids-covid-19/symptoms-causes/syc-20502550). Should my child receive the COVID-19 vaccine? As always, my practice and the practice of naturopathic medicine in general is always focused on the assessment of the individual patient. It is not a 'one size fits all' approach. For this reason, I cannot give a blanket statement as to whether all individuals in all age groups 12 years and older should get the vaccine. I have specific patients in my practice with whom I may recommend delaying the vaccine or I may recommend looking at a different type of vaccine instead of the mRNA. It is the same in my pediatric practice. While I am impressed so far with the success and tolerability of the Pfizer mRNA COVID vaccine, it does not necessarily mean I will recommend it to everyone. However, to give a general statement, I do believe it is safe and the side effects are far less than the potential side effects of the infection itself. If you choose to vaccinate your adolescent: Space any additional vaccines at least one month apart. My general recommendation for all vaccines is to space them apart instead of doing multiple types in one visit. This allows the immune system to focus on one vaccine response at a time. A discussion regarding the \"Foundations of Health\" would be very useful to have at this time. See my previous blog post for the importance of sleep, exercise, and gut health on the tolerability and success of vaccinations. I would recommend a 6 week time frame surrounding the course of the vaccine where you focus on high quality sleep, a very healthy diet, and additional time getting movement or exercise. Probiotics - see [my previous blog post (5)](http://colesnd.com/blog/covid19vaccine)for more data on probiotic usage. For adolescents I often recommend a dose between 15-30 billion organisms daily. Note: The information in this post is a general overview on the COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine in the adolescent population. Because it is a generalized discussion, it is not designed to provide treatment recommendations for those individuals who might be at higher risk for a vaccine side effect. This is something that I reserve for discussion in my one-on-one patient visits. I also think it is important to point out that the mRNA vaccines are entirely different from all other vaccines for other diseases, meaning what I discuss for the COVID-19 vaccine protocol may be slightly different from a pre and post vaccine protocol for other vaccinations.
