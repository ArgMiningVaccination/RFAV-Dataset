Lake of Banyoles Natural Feature, Park Nothing relaxes the soul quite like a picturesque lake. The Lake of Banyoles is Catalonia's largest, and a 90-minute drive from Barcelona, in the Girona region. The lake's soothing qualities have a long-standing reputation: the song 'El Monstre de Banyoles' tells the tale of how it transformed a terrifying man-eating dragon into a peaceful herbivore. Today, nature abounds above and below the shoreline. If you're feeling energetic, you can attempt a number of water sports and other activities in the area; if not, simply enjoy the quaint village nearby.
