A key element of naturopathic medicine is creating a level of health that prevents disease. Dr. Trojano offers many modalities that will assist her patients who desire this level of well-being Diet & Nutrition Counseling Nutrition is a cornerstone of naturopathic healing. What we put into our mouths has a profound effect on our physical, emotional, and spiritual health. Hippocrates said, \"Let thy food be thy medicine and thy medicine be thy food.\" Naturopathic doctors and their patients take this advice to heart and address many physical complaints through dietary adjustments. Using knowledge of physiology and biochemistry, ND's educate their patients about the dietary influences on disease symptoms and progression. Botanical Medicine Also known as herbal medicine or herbalism, botanical medicine involves the use of plants to treat disease and promote health. Animals and plants have evolved alongside each other for millennia, so it makes sense that our bodies respond readily to plant medicines. Like many of the naturopathic modalities, herbal medicine is a very old form of medicine used by cultures all around the world. "}
