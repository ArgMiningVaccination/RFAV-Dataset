In Chinese medicine, health is believed to result from the free flow of energy, called chi, in the body. Illness is attributed to blockages in this energy flow, which can be relieved by the placement of thin needles at various points in the body.

Evaluation You can make an appointment to see one of our acupuncturists directly, with or without a referral from your medical doctor. If you are uncertain about whether acupuncture may be right for you, consider scheduling an integrative medicine consultation as a first step in your treatment. At your initial consultation, the acupuncturist will discuss your health concerns with you and determine how your symptoms can best be treated with acupuncture. He or she also may analyze your pulse, which is an important method of diagnosis. Six pulses are felt on each wrist, which correspond to your major organs and their function. Each pulse is located at a specific position on your wrist. Your acupuncturist may also observe your tongue, facial and body coloring, and skin temperature and texture on different parts of your body. Treatment Acupuncture is an ancient form of Chinese medicine based on the principal of chi, or energy flow. In the Chinese medicine framework, the free flow of chi throughout the body produces optimal health. Chi is believed to flow along twelve defined pathways, called meridians, which are connected to specific organs. If chi is blocked in any way, illness may result. Acupuncture works to restore the flow of chi throughout your body by placing very thin, stainless steel, sterile needles at various points in your body. There are as many as 365 acupuncture points along the meridian pathways where needles can be inserted to restore a balance of energy. During your treatment, your acupuncturist will first start by selecting points along the appropriate meridians, which will be cleaned with cotton that has been dipped in alcohol. Sterilized needles are then placed on the selected points. Acupuncture needles are different lengths and gauges, but are generally hair-thin, solid and made of stainless steel. Some acupuncturists may use pre-sterilized, disposable needles. Typically needles are placed just below the skin's surface, but some may go deeper, depending on the points being treated. Usually, most patients only experience a brief sensation as the needle is first being placed. Once the needles are in place, they generally cannot be felt. Many patients find the treatment very relaxing and experience a feeling of well-being. Often patients are surprised at how comfortable they are during the treatment and how easily the needles are placed. Needles typically stay in place for about 30 minutes; however, this may vary depending on your individual needs. After your acupuncturist removes your needles, your insertion points are gently cleansed with cotton that has been dipped in alcohol. UCSF Health medical specialists have reviewed this information.
