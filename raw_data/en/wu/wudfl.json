From 1991 to 2012, the rate of autoimmune disease has nearly doubled. (NHANES). Even with medical advancements and improvements in dietary consciousness, many people continue to suffer with symptoms that are unexplained by medical professionals. I propose that the combination of a well-formulated ketogenic diet (WFKD) alone or with intermittent fasting could have dramatic improvements in these patients. In this talk I will explain the following: Key learning objectives/take-aways for attendees: - A very Brief and basic biochemistry and pathological review of deleterious effects of glucose and insulin - The importance of the mTOR signaling pathway as it relates to autophagy and autophagy dysfunction in complex illnesses - The scientific rational for implementing a well-formulated ketogenic diet in complex patients including discussion points on: - Inflammation and specific inflammatory cytokines triggered by a carbohydrate-rich diet - Concerns about blood lipid profiles (elevated CHOL, elevated LDL) and what the science says about this in terms of risk - Potential benefits of elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate in the blood - Brief review of dairy consumption and inflammation - Brief discussion on w-6 PUFAs and inflammation - Brief discussion of some literature on saturated fat intake and mortality - Specifically what the science defines as a well-formulated ketogenic diet - The potential benefits of intermittent fasting in patients with CCI - Non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical ways to induce or inhibit the mTOR pathway and the risks and benefits - How to initiate a WFKD and/or intermittent fasting in a patient with CCI and when NOT to use this as a therapeutic option. A fully licensed physician trained in both conventional and natural methods, Dr. Wakely's job is to \"add so much health\" to his patient's lives that there is \"no room for discomfort, pain or illness.\" His fascination with health and the human body led him to medicine after losing his mother and grandmother to cancer at a young age. He became disgruntled with the lack of cure and prevention in the conventional setting and decided to pursue naturopathic medicine. He graduated from Bastyr University in Seattle, WA, with a doctorate in naturopathic medicine (ND). He works with patients all over the USA experiencing complex chronic illnesses and immune dysregulation who have typically seen between 11-15 physicians before seeing him. His focus is on environmental medicine and infectious diseases including Lyme disease, cancer, POTS, mycotoxin illness, heavy metal exposure, mast cell activation, pain, PANS, PANDAs, and chemical sensitivity and leaky gut. He also has extensive training and clinical experience helping patients with autoimmune disorders such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis and rheumatoid arthritis using biologic and functional medicine. Because he is a wonder seeker, his current passions include orthopedic joint regeneration and metabolic issues like weight loss, type-2 diabetes, pre-diabetes, cardiovascular and metabolic syndrome and believes that it is possible to heal from these disorders. Dr. Wakely is a teacher by heart. He will teach you what is going on in your body, how the treatments work and how to optimize your terrain. He wants his patients to have a full understanding of how healing happens for them. He is passionate about teaching generations of people how to reclaim their true health, no matter how sick they are, it is possible! Dr. Wakely uses many tools to help patients get well including autonomic response technique (ART), depuration, drainage, herbal remedies, neural regeneration, homeopathy, peptide therapy, nutrients and pharmaceuticals. He lives in the greater Seattle area with his wife and two daughters and enjoys hiking, camping, music, weight lifting, reading and watching the Boston Red Sox, especially when they win. He has received post-doctoral training from, is a current or past member of the following organizations: i. American Academy of Environmental Medicine (AAEM) ii. American College for Advancement in Medicine (ACAM) iii. American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M) iv. International Peptide Society (IPS) v. Klinghardt Institute (KI) vi.
