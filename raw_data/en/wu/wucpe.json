NHSS, as stated in the introduction to the BIP, is the \"first comprehensive approach to galvanizing the [United States'] many efforts to minimize the health consequences associated with large-scale incidents, including natural disasters, disease outbreaks, hazardous materials spills, nuclear accidents, and biological and other terrorist attacks.\" The BIP's primary focus is on key outcomes that should be realized over the next 4 years and key activities for the next 2 years to put the country on a path toward realizing NHSS's goals and objectives.

Two of the cases have required hospitalization. The illnesses have been linked only to milk from the dairy, but several other products have been recalled by Umpqua as a precaution. All of the dairy's products are pasteurized, which could mean the contamination occurred during processing. Umpqua is cooperating fully with the investigation and is disinfecting the plant and reviewing processing procedures.

The survey includes young people 13 to 17years of age. Recommended vaccinations for this age-group, in addition to any childhood vaccines missed at an earlier age, include meningococcal conjugate(MenACWY), 1 dose; tetanus, diphtheria, a cellular pertussis (Tdap), 1 dose; and in females, human papillomavirus (HPV), 3 doses. The survey found that vaccination coverage among adolescents increased substantially from 2008 to2009. However, the report states that more effort is needed to continue to increase the number of adolescents vaccinated and to correct variations among states and localities. Aug "}
