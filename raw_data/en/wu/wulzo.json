The frustration of not being able to get a good night's sleep can make the situation worse.

Bed Linen Spray: Create a calming [bed linen spray](../recipes/aromatherapy-bed-linen-spray-recipe-with-essential-oils.php) and lightly spray your sheets before bedtime. Bathtime: Bathing is a wonderful way to relax, but avoid taking a bath immediately before bedtime. Hot water can increase your circulation and make it hard to fall asleep. Instead, plan to finish your bathing ritual about an hour before bed. For a moisturizing and more aromatic experience, try AromaWeb's [Bath Oil](../recipes/aromatherapy-bath-oil-recipe-blend-using-essential-oils.php) recipe. You can use this basic recipe and adapt it using your calming, skin-safe oils of choice such as [Roman Chamomile Essential Oil](/essential-oils/roman-chamomile-essential-oil.php) or [Lavender Essential Oil](/essential-oils/lavender-essential-oil.php). AromaWeb's [Aromatherapy Baths](aromatherapy-essential-oils-bathing.php) article provides additional information regarding aromatic bathing.

Be sure to select essential oils that are calming and safe for your skin. Massage: Like bathing, massage is stimulating to your circulation and should generally be avoided immediately before bedtime. Prior to bedtime, however, try gently massaging your feet and legs with a calming [massage oil](../recipes/aromatherapy-massage-oil-recipes-using-essential-oils.php) or lotion. Teatime: Borrowed from the field of herbalism, herbal teas using botanicals that have a natural sedative effect can be both soothing and relaxing before bedtime. Try natural chamomile tea. Teas made from passion flower and valerian are also considered to be very relaxing and help to encourage sleep, but do not have the familiar and pleasant flavor that chamomile tea offers. Avoid Stimulating Essential Oils Before Bedtime: Some essential oils can be particularly energizing and stimulating (i.e. cypress, rosemary, grapefruit, lemon, peppermint). Avoid using these oils and products containing them before bed or they may make your insomnia worse. The safest and most recommended course of action that you can take is to seek out the in-person guidance of a [ qualified aromatherapy practitioner](aromatherapists-aromatherapy-practitioners.php) in your area. Your particular health situation and the root cause of your insomnia can make a difference in the most suitable recommendations for you. A qualified practitioner should conduct a case history on you and guide you based on your personal background and recommend blends suitable for you and discuss suitable dosages and methods of administration. Other Naturally Based or Simple Ideas for Helping Ease Sleeplessness Include the Following: Exercise Regularly: Exercising right before bed isn't a good idea, but establishing a regular exercise routine can help ease stress, eliminate toxins from your system, improve your overall health and help you to sleep better at bedtime. Of course, the disclaimer has to be mentioned that you should talk to your doctor before starting a new health or exercise program. Avoid Eating Before Bedtime: Unless you have diabetes or a health issue that may require you to eat right before bedtime, avoid doing so. Carbohydrates, spicy foods and foodstuffs with caffeine are especially prone to making it hard to fall asleep easily. Avoid Stressful Activities and Situations Before Bedtime: Whenever possible, spend the last hour before bedtime unwinding and doing something that you find relaxing. If scary movies or tv shows gets your adrenaline racing, consider watching comedies instead. Right before bed also isn't the ideal time to finally work on your finances or call that relative who always upsets you. Tuning Out Noise: If a root cause of your insomnia is due to noise or distractions, try masking the noise by playing soothing music, using a natural noise machine (the kind that plays soothing natural sounds such as ocean waves or rain) or using ear plugs. These ideas should only be tried if you are in a sleeping situation in which you don't have to worry about masking out all noises. Tuning Out Light: If lights make it hard for you to fall asleep or stay asleep, make sure that your window treatments mask out all light, especially if your schedule requires you to sleep at times when it is light out. Eye masks are also available that filter out light. Some work better than others, so try them on first to ensure a good fit. "}
