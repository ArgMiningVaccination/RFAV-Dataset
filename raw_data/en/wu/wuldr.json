Acupuncture is a holistic health technique that stems from Traditional Chinese Medicine practices (TCM) in which trained practitioners stimulate specific points on the body by inserting thin needles into the skin. To keep the body working properly, Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that any excesses or deficiencies in yin or yang need to be corrected. By addressing the body as a whole, acupuncture is one way to bring the body back to its normal balance. Acupuncture is used to promote and restore the balance of energy, which flows throughout the body, to aid in overall wellbeing.

Vanessa M. is my go to person for my homeopathic healthcare needs. She practices acupuncture, energy mgmt., herbal remedies, skincare & wrinkle prevention. She even has simple & healthy techniques that I can do at home which help me with my healthcare needs. After every session I have with Vanessa, I leave feeling & looking better each time :) Also, the front desk is very helpful & responsive-- I text or call them to make all my appointments. They always have a time after work or on the weekends to fit my schedule. I will be a long term client at Saffron & Sage & I trust them with all my homeopathic healthcare needs. I am very grateful to have S&S & Vanessa in my life :) - Carly Whatever type of healing you need, they can most definitely provide. The vibe is SO good when you walk in and the staff is always very friendly. I went here a couple times for a massage, but ended up joining as a member for the savings and commitment to bettering myself. Not to mention they have many offerings and the massages I have gotten have been some of the best I've had. Since then I've expanded into trying things like Acupuncture and Reiki. I look forward to discovering their many other services as well. This place is a gem to say the least. - Ryan I immediately fell in love with this place from the moment I stepped into their boutique. There's a beautiful energy in the space. I had a great consultation with Kimberly, it was so refreshing to connect with someone and tell your story (and hear theirs!) without it feeling so clinical. She recommended Dr. Hilda and I've been getting acupuncture and massage with her for a few months now. She is fantastic! So caring and intuitive. And her knowledge seems to never end, she's helping me with nutrition and fertility next. I just attended my first moon circle and was so impressed with this center once again. Everyone I've met here just has a fantastic energy and really wants to help others. One final note - I LOVE the business model. I became a member which includes a certain amount of services and discounts on classes or products for a full year, and no tipping. It's just so refreshing to be able to not think about money every time I get a blissful treatment. - Melissa I came in for acupuncture and a massage from Vanessa, and I couldn't have been more pleased with the whole experience. The shop is so cute and very clean. All services are very covid-safe. There are so many types of services offered, so I will definitely be coming back! I would undoubtedly recommend Saffron & Sage, especially the acupuncture, massage, and sound bath services! Thank you so much to Kimberly Blair for organizing the whole experience and for being so awesome at your job! - Emily Chapter 2 Sometimes we get a small wake-up from the universe. Sometimes it's a really big one-those are the kinds I pay attention to. So, Vanessa M and Ashley J worked hard to get me functional....then the cosmos sent it's wake-up blessing. So I got to resume my treatments, once my doctor released me. I had lost 17lb and was very weak...add that to the groin and hernia..not a pretty picture of health. Another month of life assistance by Vanessa and Ashley.... Chapter 3 (Getting well for Fiji) is next. .... Wait, there is a Chapter 3.....thank you V and A,and all my family at S&S - Steven I never grow tired of this place! I have been coming for a few months now and the atmosphere is so serene. The staff is extremely helpful, and in particular I wanna give a shout out to Vanessa and her transformative acupuncture as well as Rob and his beautiful yoga sessions! They also provide numerous member only events such as book clubs and talk sessions that are always worth seeing. I cannot recommend this place enough :) - Lola Walking into Saffron & Sage feels like a big, warm hug! Everyone from the front desk team to management made me feel so welcome. After my complimentary consultation, I knew I had to get a membership for my wellness journey. Thank you, Kimberly! You're a rockstar! I had my first acupuncture treatment with Vanessa. Her graceful presence was extremely calming and she gently guided me every step of the way. Thank you, Vanessa, for taking care of me. I can't wait to come back for my next treatment with you. If you are looking for the perfect holistic wellness experience, this is your place. They have it all in one beautiful location. - Magda Thank you so much to the S&S staff - it was the highlight of my weekend in San Diego. I traveled to SD from the East Coast for a wellness weekend, specifically wanting to visit Saffron & Sage because of press articles and reviews I have read. It was such an amazing experience. It was my first experience with holistic therapies (did 4 over the course of the weekend) and it was the best experiences I've ever had. I feel a balance in myself that I haven't felt in years. Shout out to Vanessa, Cecelia and Jessie for the sessions and to everyone I met for your welcoming dispositions and for answering all my questions. I'll definitely be back! - Elizabeth Saffron & Sage is a God send. I have been a member now for over six months and go twice a month for cupping, acupuncture, and reiki. Cupping is my favorite (go see Vanessa!). The owner Cristen does an impeccable job of curating a healing experience for each person who walks in the door. I cannot say enough good things about this place - it is my healing home base. I am proud to call myself a Saffron & Sage member. If you are looking for healing or to up your spiritual game, this is the place to go to. - Gabrielle I simply adore the aesthetic and energy of this studio. A warm greeting awaits you as you enter! I have seen Vanessa for Acupuncture + Cupping and it is hands down a game changer. Coming here was my first experience with both and I highly recommend the combination facilitated by this wonderful practitioner. She is insightful, knowledgeable and carriers the most delightful energy to be around. Please go see her! I have had a few Reiki, energy therapy, sessions with Rachel and she too has a soothing energy that washes over you when in her presence. You will walk away on a cloud with inner peace and direction. Please enjoy her wisdom! The studio classes here are a treasure as well. The Sound Bath + Acupuncture class? I swear by Tiffany. Gabriel is a caring and magical creature who teaches yoga and more in the studio. They offer memberships, drop-in classes and non-member rates for services. Wellness services, studio classes and a wellness boutique. It's quite a treat to have all of that under one roof! Thankful for this team. - CT I have never gotten cupped or acupuncture before, till my first session at saffron and sage. Hilda made my feel super comfortable and left me informed and wanting to come back. Which I will! Thank you saffron for your healing powers! - Lorraine During my yearlong membership I would typically only see the same two practitioners for Acupuncture and Fire Cupping. Recently , I was recommended CECILIA For massage as she has a kinesiology background which would compliment the treatments I currently get at Saffron & Sage and hopefully alleviate the pain I suffer from arthritis . Before I had seen Cecilia I had 24/7 pain and love that she introduced me to Silicone cupping for my super tight Quads and IT bands. After applying this modality after just 2 days, the tightness and pain is completely gone and I have resumed my daily walks. Thank you Cecilia - Jade I had the most amazing experience with Tiffany. I was running late so I was a bit frazzled, but the calming energy hit me as soon as I walked in the front door. I had an acupuncture and cupping session and it was my first time doing cupping - it was incredible! I'll definitely be doing it on a more regular basis moving forward. Thanks, Saffron and Sage and Tiffany! - Sarah Today was my first experience at Saffron & Sage. I had the wonderful pleasure of receiving acupuncture and cupping from Vanessa. Vanessa took the time to listen and really get into my current health and psychical state. It was my first time cupping and she made the experience enjoyable and relaxing. I am very happy with the service and feel great. If your looking for a personal and tailored experience that goes below the surface this is the place. - Nick Cristin helped me develop a wellness plan to help me recover from some intense trauma that addresses my physical, emotional, and spiritual needs. It's only been a few weeks but I'm already feeling some big shifts and changes! Accupunture and cupping with Vanessa, and restorative yoga have all been incredible experiences! I'm so thankful for Saffron and Sage! - Laura Received acupuncture/cupping treatment for neck strain and arthritis in thumb joint. Very pleasurable experience (my first) and left feeling energized and reinvigorated. Everyone should do this on a regular basis. - Grady An amazing place for those wishing to work on themselves, whether physically or otherwise. Initially went in for acupuncture and cupping to address back pain. It was healing and invigorating! I've been back for massage, and began energy therapy for personal growth that has been transformative. Thank you Saffron & Sage. - Christian 6 months of chronic pain, 3 specialist, 10+ doctor visits, pain management clinic, x-rays, ultrasounds, MRI and 4 different pain medications. A friend recommended that I'll try Saffron & Sage. I was greeted by a lovely receptionist, she offered me tea and was very knowledgeable about the services and products, I was curious about. Vanessa, the acupuncturist was so sweet and I could tell that she was truly listening, to my story of aches and pains. After an amazing experience by her treatment, I had ZERO pain, it was like a miracle. I expected the pain to return any minute, but I had no pain for the rest of the day, a first in 6 months. I love this place. - Jaana My acupuncture session with Vanessa was life changing. I have been carrying around so much stress and tension I felt sluggish, constantly tired and overwhelmed. She knew exactly what to do and I walked out of her treatment room floating. I woke up this morning feeling lighter, more grounded and my skin was glowing. Thank you Vanessa, you are an actual magician! - Jessie Acupuncture session with Dr. Hilda was wonderful. She was attentive and extremely professional. I experienced a pain-free, relaxing treatment and afterwards felt much emotional release. The treatment room was pleasant in every sense as far as aesthetics and comfort. All staff I met were courteous and careful to adhere to safety regulations. I'm fortunate enough to live close enough to walk, but regardless there's plenty of free street parking. - Carol I visited Saffron & Sage for the first time yesterday; I arrived at the recommendation of my wife, who purchased a membership for me over the holiday. I suffer from chronic physical pain, specifically in my lower back, shoulders and IT bands. I've sought out many types of care: physical therapy, massages, dry needling, preventative treatments, among others, and had only temporary success at most. Today was my first experience with acupuncture and it was absolutely amazing. Tiffany was my practitioner and she was extremely knowledgeable, professional and asked the kind of questions that told me she knew what she was doing and care about my pain. An hour later, I left feeling exponentially better, with sensation and mobility in areas that I hadn't felt in years. When I asked about the process and healing, Tiffany took the time to explain the biology behind my treatment and backed it up with data, research and case studies. I absolutely recommend Saffron & Sage to anyone who is interested, as well as to those who suffer from chronic pain and haven't found a way to fix it. - Frankie Saffron & Sage is the best thing to happen to San Diego. Every aspect of being there is heavenly and meditative and I can't recommend it enough. From yoga to acupuncture, everything is so well done and every person that works there is so attentive, compassionate and well-versed in their trade. - Ava I am so happy I found Saffron & Sage! I've been seeing Vanessa since July for facial acupuncture and she is a miracle worker. Vanessa is kind, compassionate, and extremely professional. She is a calming presence and has been critical in my wellness journey toward finding balance & relaxation. It is clear that Vanessa is a master in her craft, and I cannot recommend her or Saffron & Sage more highly. Thank you team for everything that you do! - Jaclyn I had a WONDERFUL experience during my very first (ever) acupuncture and cupping session. I actually called to cancel my appt due to me being very sick, but they encouraged me to come in as it would be beneficial for my health and give me a better night's sleep. I have to say, I think it was serendipitous that I had an appt during this time. The experience was nothing short of relaxing and peaceful, I had the most soundest sleep that I've had in weeks, and I woke up feeling like a human again. I was out of work for 3 days and I woke up feeling like I could tackle my to do list. I can't wait to come back and continue my wellness journey, beginning with the inside out. A huge thank you to all of the staff that has made me feel so welcomed. - Angela I am a Member and have been to Saffron & Sage 3 times in the last two weeks and I am already yearning to go back. I am in the middle of grieving a heavy loss and realize that self-care is extra important for our mind, body, and soul during these times (and all times). I saw Vanessa for acupuncture and cupping, and Cecilia (twice) for massage. Both women are so lovely and welcoming, and wonderfully sensitive and in-tune. It has become a safe space for me to be with all of my emotions and I couldn't be more grateful. -Angela I go mainly to receive reiki and acupuncture with Vanessa. It was my first time having acupuncture with her back in August 2020. Vanessa made me feel safe throughout the entire treatment by asking me if any of the needles felt uncomfortable and explaining how acupuncture benefits the body. Then she did reiki and I swear after every session I feel more balanced, reflective, and overall relaxed. I keep coming back to Saffron & Sage because Vanessa's treatments renew my daily energy and help me sleep better at night. The practitioners and concierges are always so helpful and warm at Saffron & Sage. If you're curious to try this place out I'd recommend it. - Angela "}
