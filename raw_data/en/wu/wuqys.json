Unfortunately the therapeutic potential of these compounds is limited by their poor intestinal and intracellular bioavailability. Therefore this study sought to examine how combinations of quercetin, resveratrol, and curcumin, with and without piperine, 200 nM, affected an in vitro permeability and curcumin applied apically alone or in combination at 50 \u00b5M and measured in the basal chamber at 30 min. Results: Resveratrol received the greatest enhancement in permeability quercetin alone (147%) and both quercetin and resveratrol (188%), addition in a 229% increase in permeability. Quercetin permeability was not significantly affected using any combination, but showed maximal permeability when combined with resveratrol and the lowest permeability when combined with resveratrol, curcumin piperine together. Conclusion: Combination of quercetin, resveratrol curcumin may improve intestinal absorption of resveratrol and curcumin without affecting quercetin absorption. These data highlight the need for further research and suggest that developing combination therapies may improve intestinal absorption of these constituents. Our study also demonstrates that the apical-to-basal permeability across intact caco-2 monolayer model is a viable model to investigate absorption of natural compounds.

PhD Journal Compilation \u00a92014, AARM of Restorative Medicine 2014; 3: page Resveratrol Curcumin Absorption in Combination INTRODUCTION Quercetin, resveratrol and curcumin are increasingly being researched due to their apparent therapeutic activity in numerous disease states. 1-9 Quercetin, a ubiquitous flavonol found in most land-plants including many foods and dietary supplements, has demonstrated beneficial effects in inflammatory and immune conditions including cardiovascular disease, cancer, asthma/allergies and stress. 1-3 Resveratrol, a naturally produced stilbenoid found in Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica) and more famously in the skin of red grapes (Vitis vinifera), has displayed antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic effects and may be beneficial in preventing complications associated with diabetes, atherosclerosis, aging and metabolic disease. 4-6 Resveratrol appears to work through the activa-tion of SIRT1 (silent mating-type information regulation -adenosine kinase) in is inhibitor the inhibitory B alpha kinase (I B kinase), a key activator of nuclear-factor B (NF- B). 7 Blocking this central mediator makes curcumin therapeutically active in various inflammatory disease states including arthritis, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, neurodegeneration and tumerogenesis. 7-9 Unfortunately, despite the impressive therapeutic potential of these compounds, they have also demonstrated poor bioavailability when given orally. This feature limits their use as supple-ments because large doses are required to achieve therapeutic intracellular levels. 3, 10, 11 Curcumin bioavailability has been improved by delivering it in liposomal preparations or by coadministering it with piperine. 12, 13 Piperine is a piperidine alka- loid found in the fruit of the black pepper (Piper nigrum), and is responsible for the pungency of black pepper spice. Piperine's effect on curcumin bioavailability is believed to be due to its inhibition of phase II glucuronidation; 14 piperine may also improve intestinal epithelial uptake by inhibiting P-glycoprotein-1 (P-gp; a broad-acting xenobi-otic efflux transporter). 15 Interestingly, there is also evidence to suggest quercetin is also a P-gp inhibitor for some compounds; in fact, many herbs/constituents have demonstrated modulation of this efflux pump. 15, 16 Quercetin, resveratrol and curcumin, despite their various botanical origins, all share similar biosynthesis pathways originating with 4-hydoxy-cinnamic acid of the shikimate pathway - a major synthesis pathway utilized by plants to synthesize aromatic/phenolic secondary compounds and amino acids. The molecular topography of these three compounds also display similar features which suggests they may share targets for absorption or efflux and may alter each other's uptake (Figure 1).

MATERIALS AND METHODS REA gENTS Cell culture reagents: Eagle's minimum essential media (EMEM), Hank's and trypsin-ethylenediaminetet-raacetic acid (0.25%) were purchased (Corning, V A, USA); fetal bovine serum (FBS) was purchased from Atlanta Biologicals (GA, USA). High performance liquid chromatog-raphy (HPLC) reagents: acetic acid, sodium acetate, methanol and acetonitrile were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (MO, USA). Samples of quercetin, resveratrol and curcumin and a blend of curcumin and piperine (PC) were gifts from Gaia Herbs (NC, USA). Additional standards of quercetin, resvera-trol, curcumin and piperine were quercetin, resveratrol, curcumin and piperine were prepared in methanol at 1 mg/mL. Stocks were stored at 20\u00b0C and monitored regu-larly for stability. The PC blend was prepared as a 1 mg/mL stock solution and assayed to contain 148 \u00b5M curcumin and 0.6 \u00b5M piperine. CELL CULTURE Caco-2 cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Virginia, USA) were cultured in EMEM supplemented with and 1% in 75-cm tissue culture flasks and grown in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37\u00b0C and saturating humidity with media changes every 2-3 days. Cells were passaged by rinsing with PBS and detachment with 0.25% trypsin and 0.5 mM EDTA. In vItro ABSORPTION For in vitro absorption studies cells were harvested and seeded in 24-well plates fitted with polycar - bonate Transwell\u00ae inserts (6.5 mm i.d., 0.4-m pore size, 0.3 cm 2 of growth area, Corning Costar Co., NY) at a density of 75,000 cells/insert. Cells in the inserts were grown for 21 days and the transepithe-lial electrical resistance (TEER) measured regularly to monitor the monolayer integrity. Only wells that had a TEER value greater than 400 (cm 2) were used for absorption experiments (TEER = (Rmonolayer Rblank) \u00d7 Area). Inserts with intact monolayers were rinsed with HBSS and transferred to a clean 24-well plate and allowed to equilibrate in HBSS for 1 h. After equilibration TEER was verified and HBSS on the apical side was replaced with HBSS containing the treatments alone or in combination (quercetin, resveratrol and curcumin at 50 \u00b5M and piperine at 200 nM). After 30 min 700 \u00b5L of HBSS was removed from the basal compartment and imme-diately combined with an equal volume of 10 mM acetic acid in an HPLC sample vial. Samples were then immediately analyzed by HPLC. HPLC Quantitation of quercetin, resveratrol and curcumin an Alliance HPLC system with 2998 photodiode array (Waters Corporation, MA, USA) equipped with an Agilent Eclipse XDB-C18 column (4.6 \u00d7 50 mm, 3.5 \u00b5m) at 35\u00b0C. Mobile phase consisted of A: 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH 4.0) and B: acetonitrile. Flow rate was 0.6 mL/min and gradient conditions were 0 min, 75% A; 8 min, 55% A; 18 min, 55% A followed by 5 min of equilibration at 75% A. Detection was done using the 306 for each was calculated using the following equation: 17, 18 =*b app adC dTPCA where (dCb/dT) is the rate of appearance of the constituent on the basal side (nmol/s), Ca is the concentration of the constituent on the apical side (50 \u00b5M) and A is the area of the monolayer (0.3 cm 2). The apparent permeability coefficient is property of individual compounds which describes its ability Journal of Restorative Medicine 2014; 3: page 115 Quercetin, Resveratrol and Curcumin Absorption in Combination to pass through a cell monolayer under the experi- mental conditions. Each treatment or treatment combination was repeated three times in separate wells, using new caco-2 monolayers for each experiment. P app values (n = 3) between constituent alone and their combi-nations were compared using the Student's t-test (two-tailed, unpaired), statistical significance was assumed at a of = 0.05. RESULTS HPLC ANAL ySIS Quercetin, resveratrol and total curcumanoids were well resolved using this method and quantitation was linear in the range tested (0.15-110 \u00b5M) (Figure 2). Quercetin had a retention time of approximately 4.7 min, resveratrol 3.6 min and curcumin displayed the typical three curcuminoids: bisdemethoxycurcumin (11.4 min), demethoxyc-urcumin (12.1 min) and curcumin (12.9 min) (Figure 2). Only curcumin was detected in the basal chamber in the absorption experiments. Piperine, when included, co-eluted with demethoxycurcumin at 12 min and was detected in the basal chamber, but was not quantitated. CACO-2 MONOLA yER PERMEABILIT y Each of the three compounds tested showed consistent transport across caco-2 monolayers. When applied singly, quercetin showed the highest apparent permeability (P app \u00d7 106, cm/s) (10.09 \u00b1 0.77) followed 1.10) then (0.99 \u00b1 0.11) (Figure 3). In combi-nation, both resveratrol and curcumin achieved significantly higher permeability. Quercetin did not receive any significant benefit from combination, but showed the highest permeability when paired with resveratrol (11.90 \u00b1 0.52) and piperine (8.89 \u00b1 combined with quercetin and curcumin, showed a significant increase in P app (7.70 \u00b1 1.10 to 25.09 \u00b1 0.48), inclusion of piperine resulted in a further increase to 27.22 \u00b1 0.89. In order to determine if either quercetin or curcumin were responsible for this effect, they were applied singly with resveratrol; however both caused a similar increase in P aap (24.92 \u00b1 0.68 and 24.45 \u00b1 0.69, respectively) (Figure 3). Curcumin demonstrated a similar pattern to resveratrol when applied in combination, though the magnitude was not as great. When paired with quercetin or resveratrol alone, P app increased moderately but not significantly (1.46 \u00b1 0.15 and 1.25 \u00b1 0.07, respectively). When all three were combined there was a significant increase in P app (1.85 \u00b1 0.13), the addition of piperine increased the Papp to 2.26 \u00b1 0.21. Interestingly, the greatest effect was observed with curcumin and piperine alone which resulted in a P app of 2.33 \u00b1 0.12 (Figure 3). Together this suggests an additive effect of resveratrol and quer - cetin on curcumin absorption and that quercetin and resveratrol absorption are also affected by piperine and may compete with curcumin in these pathways. DISCUSSION The transepithelial permeability across intact mono-layers using caco-2 cells is a well validated and accepted method to model intestinal absorption. 17, 19 It is commonly employed as a preliminary screen to determine transport barriers in the development of pharmaceuticals and recently has been employed to investigate the absorption of natural compounds. 17, 20, 21 The current study demonstrates that this model may also provide a cost-effective method to screen absorption characteristics of naturally derived compounds singly or in combination therapies and to provide preliminary data to support in vivo studies. The main limiting factors of this experiment were 1) poor aqueous solubility of the test substances, and 2) poor aqueous stability of quercetin at physio-logical pH. 22 In order to prevent precipitation of the test substances alone or in combination, a concen-tration of 50 \u00b5M was chosen. This concentration was stable over the time-frame of the experi-ment, including analysis time (data not shown). In order to overcome the instability of quercetin in aqueous solutions at pH of 7.4, the treatments were prepared immediately before the experiment and the exposures were limited to 30 min. After 30 min the samples were immediately acidified which Journal of Restorative Medicine 2014; 3: page 116Quercetin, Resveratrol and and curcumin (428 nm). Seven point standard curves were calculated based on the average peak area \u00b1 SD (n = 3) at each concentration (0.15-110 \u00b5M); curcuminoid standard curve was calculated from the total peak area of the three major curcuminoids. stabilized the quercetin for analysis (Figure 4). An aqueous concentration (50 \u00b5M) was chosen in favor of higher concentrations in non-aqueous solvents (DMSO, dimethylformamide, etc.) in order to better approximate oral ingestion of these supplements (i.e. capsule taken with water).This study demonstrates that applying quercetin, resveratrol and curcumin in combination can signifi-cantly increase apical-to-basal uptake of curcumin and resveratrol. Although quercetin absorption did not significantly increase from these combinations, it did not decrease either - no significant change Journal of Restorative Medicine 2014; 3: page 117 Quercetin, quercetin (Q), (B) resveratrol (R) or (C) curcumin (C), alone or in combination across intact caco-2 monolayers. Compounds were applied apically at 50 \u00b5M (piperine (P) at 200 nM) and measured in the basal compartment at 30 min. Data is expressed as the average P app \u00d7 106 (cm/s) of three separate experiments \u00b1 SD. Bars labeled with different letters are significantly different from each other, P < 0.05. from quercetin alone was observed when combined with the other compounds. It is worth mentioning, however, that quercetin showed the lowest absorption in the PQRC combination suggesting piperine may adversely affect quercetin permeability. In contrast, adding piperine appears to have a positive effect on Journal of Restorative Medicine 2014; 3: page 118Quercetin, Resveratrol and Combination apical-to-basal permeability, with resveratrol and curcumin. This latter observation is consistent with a previous study that showed improved bioavailability of curcumin when applied with piperine. 12 Resveratrol absorption has been shown to be primarily passive, but suffers from extensive sulfate and glucuronidate conjugation reactions. 23, 24 The increases in resveratrol permeability observed in this study may be due to inhibition of these conju-gation reactions and blockade of resveratrol apical export. Regardless of the combination, resveratrol demonstrated a significant increase in permeability and there were no differences observed between combinations; this may suggest that there is overlap in the mechanisms and at the concentrations used the effect was saturated. Quercetin is known to affect the pharmacokinetics of various compounds by modulating transport and metabolism, some of the observed effects include: inhibition of CYP3A4 (IC sulfotransferase 1A1) inhibition the P-gp efflux pump.15, 16, 25, 29, 30 These activities could explain increased permeability of curcumin and resvera-trol in the presence of quercetin. Curcumin has also demonstrated inhibition of P-gp and CYP3A4; 15, 31, 32 however, resveratrol does not appear to be exported by P-gp, rather it is exported by the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2). 33, 34 Recent evidence also suggests that curcumin inhibits BCRP, which may explain the improved permeability of resveratrol observed with curcumin in the current study. 35 Similarly, piperine has demonstrated various activities which may contribute to its effect on permeability. Like quercetin and curcumin, piperine inhibits CYP3A4 and inhibits glucuronidation14 and may affect MDR1 and BCRP.36 These activities have been attributed to its effect on curcumin permeability, but this data shows that it may also contribute to absorption of resveratrol since there was a modest rise in P aap when piperine was included. As mentioned previously, these compounds are prod- ucts of the same biosynthetic pathway (shikimate) and share several structural elements (Figure 1). It is not surprising therefore that the literature suggests that these compounds utilize and modulate similar pathways for membrane transport and metabolism. Collectively they may cause a substantial effect on P-gp, BCRP, CYP3A4 and other enzymes of xenobiotic metabolism. It is likely that the concerted inhibition, competition or modulation of membrane transporter and biotransformation enzymes of 1.2 1.0 0.8 0.6Per Initial Peak Area0.4 0.2 0.0 05 0 100 150Aqueous 5 mM Acetic Acid 200 Time (minutes)2503 00 350 Figure 4: Stabilization of quercetin using acetic acid.

CONCLUSIONS Quercetin, resveratrol and curcumin may provide substantial therapeutic benefit especially in aging and chronic inflammatory diseases. This underscores the importance of investigating the bioavailability and efficacy of these compounds in order to maximize their therapeutic potential. These data suggest that delivering these compounds in combination may improve the acute bioavailability of curcumin and resveratrol compared to supple-mentation with single compounds, allowing for lower overall doses and simpler treatment protocols using combination therapies. The current study was able to show improved permeability of these compounds when applied in combination; however, future studies are needed to investigate the specific mechanisms including the use of inhibitors for export pathways such as P-gp, MRP2 and BCRP. Additionally, long-term or consistent exposure to these combinations is likely to affect absorption considering that previous studies have demonstrated changes in expression of meta-bolic and transport enzymes with longer exposures (i.e. UGT1A1, CYP3A4, P-gp). 16, 37 Further studies on the long-term modulation of biotransformation pathways of these combinations are warranted as well as in vivo studies using combination therapies.
