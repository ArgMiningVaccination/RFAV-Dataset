The acquisition was made possible by a $1 million grant through the Health Resources and Service Administration, whose programs include support of health infrastructure. The agency, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, serves communities that are geographically isolated and economically or medically vulnerable. The microscope is called the FLIM-FRET fast imaging system (fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and F\u00f6rster's resonance energy transfer). Christie Lacy, a senior research associate who manages the cellular and molecular imaging core at the institute, said the equipment will allow researchers in neuroscience, cardiovascular research and cancer research to gain a greater understanding of such interactions and how they affect human development and disease. * * * University of Lynchburg names new dean The University of Lynchburg has named Dr. Sabita Manian dean of the [Lynchburg College of Arts and Sciences](https://www.lynchburg.edu/academics/lynchburg-college-of-arts-and-sciences/).

He did his residency at Philadelphia's Temple University, where he was chief resident from 1989-90, and completed a cardiology fellowship at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire. * * * Emory & Henry gets grant for historical preservation Emory & Henry College has received a $25,000 grant to support local and regional history preservation from the Roller Bottimore Foundation. \"The Watershed Project: Civic Memory for a Citizenship of Place\" has a two-fold purpose - to preserve, index, and archive a wide range of historical material related to the history and operation of Emory & Henry College, the oldest institution of higher learning in Southwest Virginia. The Watershed Project is being undertaken by the Appalachian Center for Civic Life at Emory & Henry. The project is supported by an advisory panel composed of scholars and members of the community, which will meet regularly to offer feedback, ideas and assessments of the project. The initial discovery phase of this project has begun and more information can be accessed at the project web page, found here. The final result will be a virtual history of Southwest Virginia and Emory & Henry College that will be multidimensional, dynamic, and useful to scholars, students, teachers, and members of the community.
