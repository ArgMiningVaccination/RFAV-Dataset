Group III, DC, NP Wellness Driven by Innovation My story begins like so many - with personal challenges. But those challenges led me to the way of natural healing, and a lifelong pursuit of better, cleaner living. After having lost both of my parents to cancer early in life, I decided to pursue a path of optimum personal health. I began educating myself on clean eating and herbal remedies, and committed to a plant-based diet. It was transformative in how I felt, and I knew I needed to dedicate my newfound knowledge to helping others who wanted to change their lives. Global Healing was born. As a company, we now offer more than a quarter century of helping customers achieve better health. We are continually finetuning our product formulas, how we source supplement ingredients, and our manufacturing processes. After all that growth, we maintain our inclusive, friendly company culture; we're still 100% family-owned and operated. No big pharma here! I lead Global Healing with an entrepreneurial spirit, combining science with time-tested alternative and complementary natural health knowledge. If you want to change but aren't sure where to begin, think of your health as a journey. I encourage you to spend time learning more about how you can heal yourself from within. We're here to help, every step of the way. Wellness Driven by Innovation My story begins like so many - with personal challenges.
