Complicationsinclude publications suggesting a link between the MMR vaccine, autism, and bowel disordershave generated concerns about it, 2-3and the rate of vac- cination uptake has fallen. Since then, published scientificevidence has failed to confirm any link, 4-5yet parents are still declining the vaccine. The year 2000 saw a measles out-break in Dublin, with 1220 cases notified and two deaths,despite the availability of the vaccine. 6 Why are parents choosing or not choosing to have the MMR vaccine? It has been suggested that the media may bean important influence on patient choice. 7-8Some studies also indicate the importance of profile characteristics, suchas age, social class, number of children, and single parentstatus. 9-11Other studies have focused on an individual's beliefs. Bennett and Smith explored parents' beliefs aboutmumps, measles and rubella infections and noted concernspecific to the MMR vaccination even before the controver-sial publications. 12Qualitative studies have reported that some parents who chose not to vaccinate believed that vac-cinations could harm the immune system. 13-15 Research has also indicated that parents' attitudes towards health professionals and the attitudes of those giving social support may also have a role in parents' dec-isions about vaccinating their children. 16In particular, Evans et al carried out a focus group study of parents and concluded that many parents lack confidence in the rec-ommendations of health professionals as they know thatthese professionals have immunisation targets to reach. 17 This is in line with the recent emphasis on the importanceof trust in the doctor-patient relationship. 18 However, in a quantitative study, Ramsay et al reported that the large majority of the parents questioned believedthat the MMR vaccine was safe and carried only a slight riskto health, and nearly all stated that they would have theirchildren fully immunised against all childhood infections. 19 The decision to vaccinate may also be influenced by a fearof how they might feel if something went wrong. Kaiexplored this in a qualitative study of children's illness ingeneral, and reported that when children are ill parents arestrongly influenced by a sense of responsibility to act ascompetent parents and the fear of overwhelming guiltshould they fail to do so. 20 Finally, previous research exploring a multitude of health- related behaviours illustrates the importance of past behav-iour as being the best predictor of future behaviour. 21In line with this, the decision to vaccinate a child may also relate toM Flynn, MB BS, MSc , general practitioner, Ardingly Court Surgery, Brighton.

Design of study: Prospective questionnaire study. Setting: Brighton and Hove area of East Sussex. Method: Five hundred and eleven parents (response rate = 56.9%) completed a baseline questionnaire regarding their profilecharacteristics, beliefs about MMR and previous vaccination historyprior to receiving a letter to attend for their child's vaccination.Attendance data was collected at follow-up by the age of 2 years. Results: The majority of parents believed that measles, mumps and rubella were serious illnesses and stated that they would feel guiltyabout any adverse consequences of their decision aboutvaccination. Many responders were ambivalent about the benefit ofvaccinations and were unsure whether to trust either the medicalprofession or the media. Uptake of MMR vaccination at follow-upwas related to previous uptake for vaccination, increased faith inthe medical profession, increased faith in the media, and a lowerbelief that vaccination is unhealthy and can harm the immunesystem. Conclusion: Many parents hold mixed beliefs about the MMR vaccination and the doctors who administer it. Uptake relates topast vaccination and more positive their siblings' vaccination history. To date, most research examining vaccination uptake has eitherbeen qualitative and descriptive or cross-sectional in design.The present study uses a prospective design to firstdescribe baseline beliefs about MMR vaccine and then toassess the role of profile characteristics, beliefs and pastbehaviour in predicting actual uptake of the MMR vaccine atfollow-up. Method Participants The study population comprised all the parents of children in the Brighton and Hove area ( n = 898), who were due to receive an invitation for the MMR vaccination over a 3-monthperiod. Questionnaires were sent out prior to the letter ofinvitation and 513 responses were received, with 511responders having answered sufficiently for their responsesto be used for analysis (response rate = 56.9%). Follow-updata on uptake was collected for all 898 parents from thechild health records. Design The study involved a prospective design. Baseline measuresof profile characteristics and beliefs were assessed prior toinvitation to attend for vaccination for MMR, and actual uptakeof vaccination by 2 years of age was measured at follow-up. Procedure Parents of children born between 1 November 1997 and 31January 1998 were identified using the child health system,which maintains computerised data on the immunisationstatus of all the children in the area. The child health depart-ment sent out the questionnaire and covering letter in orderto comply with the Data Protection Act, and they also sentout reminders to non-responders. Uptake of vaccination waschecked at two years of age. The questionnaire The questionnaire was developed from themes taken fromthe qualitative literature and from previous questionnairesurveys. 7-22The questionnaire was piloted on parents whosechildren were above the age to be included in the study. Ethical approval was obtained from the East Sussex LocalResearch Ethics Committee. The questionnaire was broken down into the following sections: Profile characteristics and past behaviour. Participants record- ed their age, sex, ethnic origin, employment status, home-ownership and whether or not they were single parents, aswell as details about how many children they had andwhether or not they had previously received vaccinations. Beliefs. Participants noted their response to a series of state- ments (Box 1) on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 'strong-ly disagree' (1) to 'strongly agree' (5). Total scores were sum-mated and the reliability of the scores was assessed usingCronbach's . For descriptive purposes these scores were recoded as 'disagree' (1 to 2), 'somewhat agree' (3) and'agree' (4 to 5). Uptake. At the age of 2 years, actual uptake of the MMR vac- cine was accessed via the child health department, andentered as 'yes or no'.Original papers HOW THIS FITS IN What is known already Scares about the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination have resulted in a decline in its uptake. Cross-sectional and qualitative research highlights the role of patients' beliefs. What this paper adds Parents often have mixed and complex beliefs about theMMR vaccination and about doctors that may be difficult tochange. The best predictors of uptake were past vaccinationbehaviour, positive beliefs about the medical profession andthe vaccination, and an increased faith in the media. Byencouraging uptake of earlier, less controversial vaccinationsa culture of uptake could be created. British Journal of General Practice, July 2004 527Beliefs of others . This contained four items; for example, 'My relatives have encouraged me to vaccinate my child','My friends have encouraged me not to vaccinate my child'.A higher score reflected increased encouragement fromothers (Cronbach's = 0.4) Severity of illnesses. This contained four items; for example, 'Measles may be a serious illness for a child', 'Mumps maybe a dangerous illness'. A higher score reflected increasedbelief that measles, mumps and rubella are serious illnesses(Cronbach's = 0.54) Guilt about consequences. This contained three items; for example, 'I would feel guilty if my child caught an illness thatcould have been prevented by vaccination', 'I would feel itwas my fault if my child was damaged by vaccination'. Ahigher score reflected an increased concern about theconsequences of the decision (Cronbach's = 0.51) Experience of issues. This contained four items; for example, 'I have a friend/relative who has been affectedseriously by being vaccinated', 'I have a friend/relative whohas been seriously affected by catching measles or mumpsor rubella'. A higher score reflected increased experience ofthe issues involved (Cronbach's = 0.46) Vaccination is unhealthy. This contained six items; for example, 'Natural protection from catching the real illness isbetter than immunity from vaccination', 'Vaccination couldpossibly harm the body's immune system'. An increasedscore an increased belief that vaccination isunhealthy (Cronbach's = 0.83) Faith in the medical profession. This contained four items; for example, 'I have confidence that my doctor will alwaysdo what is best for my family and me', 'I would ask my[general practitioner] GP if I needed information aboutvaccinations'. An increased score reflected increased faithin the medical profession (Cronbach's = 0.65) Faith in the media. This contained four items; for example, 'I rely on information about health problems from magazines','Magazines have interesting stories about health but theyare not always accurate'. An increased score reflectedincreased faith in the media (Cronbach's = 0.40) Box 1. Details of the beliefs section of the study questionnaire. Data analysis The results were analysed using SPSS for Windows to describe the participants' profile characteristics, past behav-iour and beliefs using descriptive statistics, and to identifythe best predictors of uptake of vaccination using logisticregression with uptake entered as the dependent variable.Probabilities and confidence intervals are reported. Results Profile characteristics Participants' profile characteristics are shown in Table 1. The majority of the responses were from women. One question-naire was returned by both parents. The parents' medianage was 31 years, most responders had one or two childrenand were homeowners, and a fifth were single parents.There were very few responses from ethnic minorities, whichreflects the mainly white population of the area being stud-ied. The majority of responders' children had previouslyattended for all vaccinations. Beliefs Participants' beliefs are shown in Table 2. Over half of theresponders showed only moderate agreement that they hadbeen encouraged by others to have their children vaccinated,but only a very small minority stated that they had clearlybeen discouraged. A large majority felt that measles, mumpsand rubella were severe illnesses and reported concernsabout the consequences of their decision, although very fewhad any direct experience of the issues involved. In responseto questions regarding the beliefs about vaccinations, almosthalf of responders disagreed that they were unhealthy.However, almost as many were unsure. Finally, the majoritywere mixed in their confidence in doctors, and the majorityreported having little faith in the media. Predicting uptake of MMR vaccination The follow-up data showed that 22.3% ( n = 114) of the study sample did not have their child vaccinated by the age of2 years and that 77.7% ( n = 397) did. Logistic regression was used to assess the best predictors of uptake of theMMR vaccination. Profile characteristics and total beliefswere entered into the analysis as the independent variables,and uptake was the dependent variable (Table 3). Uptake ofMMR was related to previous attendance for vaccination,increased faith in the medical profession, increased faith inthe media, and a lower belief that vaccination is unhealthy. Discussion This study aimed to describe parents' beliefs about the MMRvaccination and to assess the best predictors of uptake. Thedata were collected in 1999 and 2000 and provide insightsinto beliefs and vaccination behaviour after a time of intensemedia coverage concerning the MMR vaccine and its poss-ible risks. Summary of main findings With regard to beliefs about MMR, the majority of the par-ents believed that measles, mumps and rubella are seriousillnesses and that they would feel guilty about any adverse consequences of their decision about vaccination. However,many responders were ambivalent about the benefit of vac-cinations and were unsure whether to trust either the med-ical profession or the media. Much previous research hasbeen qualitative and has involved small sample sizes. 13-17 The results from the present study provide support for thesestudies. These results indicate that, although measles,mumps and rubella are generally recognised as serious,concerns about vaccination and the medical profession arenot confined to a small minority of dissenters. Patients aresometimes considered to be either for or against medicineand for or against the medical profession. The results fromthis study suggest that this is a simplistic picture of patients'beliefs. Patients may believe that some illnesses have ser-ious medical complications, they may be sceptical of themedical solution and the medical professionals offering thissolution, and yet still follow the orthodox medical advice.Individuals can hold complex sets of beliefs that, althoughappearing inconsistent to the medical profession, makesense to the individuals themselves. In terms of understanding vaccination uptake, the best predictors of uptake for the MMR vaccination were previousattendance for vaccination, increased faith in the medicalprofession, increased faith in the media, and less concernthat vaccination is unhealthy. These results support previousresearch, which has highlighted an important role for pastbehaviour in predicting future behaviour and suggests thatvaccination uptake is similarly consistent. 20 The results also support a central role for trust in doctors and the need for agood doctor-patient relationship if uptake targets are to bemet. 18However, although biased media coverage was 528 British Journal of General Practice, July 2004M Flynn and J Ogden Table 1.

Strengths and weaknesses of the study Previous studies exploring uptake of MMR have mainlybeen descriptive and have used cross-sectional designs.The present study used a prospective design, enablingconclusions to be drawn about baseline predictors. This isthe main strength of the study, as it removes the possibilityof retrospective bias and post hoc justifications. However,some patients did not return the questionnaire, raising theproblem of responder bias. It is possible that those whoreturned the questionnaire had different beliefs and profilecharacteristics than those who did not. Owing to theanonymous nature of the questionnaire we do not have anyinfo-rmation about the non-responders. However, thedemographics of the responders reflect those of the popu-lation studied, and their beliefs are consistent with thosefound in previous research, indicating that generalisationsfrom this sample can be made. Implications for practice The results from the present study indicate concern aboutboth the MMR vaccination and the risks of related illnesses,and show mixed feelings towards the medical profession andthe media. Within the context of such beliefs, the deliberationsmade by parents about whether or not to vaccinate becomemore understandable, as they are often balancing a set ofcomplex and sometimes contradictory concerns. Theseresults provide a dilemma for doctors. By illuminating how parents think about vaccinations, these results could helpdoctors to understand and respect parents' beliefs and theirresulting decision not to vaccinate. Such an approach is intune with patient-centred care and makes the patient'schoice paramount. 20-22However, many GPs may not feel that this is in the best interest of the child or the community andmay wish to influence parents' choice. In contrast, therefore,these results could provide doctors with some insights intohow to change beliefs and increase uptake rates. If doctorswish to encourage parents to vaccinate their children theyneed to promote positive views about both themselves andthe MMR vaccination itself. However, this is not a novel con-clusion 17,19and simply repeating the need for such a change in views may not make such changes any more likely.26In contrast, perhaps the role of past behaviour does providedoctors with a window of opportunity for change. The results from this study show that past vaccination history predicts MMR vaccination uptake. This relates to all vaccinations, notjust to MMR. Doctors could, therefore, place more emphasison encouraging uptake for earlier, less controversial vac-cinations and use these earlier vaccinations as an opport-unity for discussing the issues about vaccination. Such anearly emphasis may create a culture of vaccination uptakewhich could itself become self-perpetuating. References 1. Salisbury D, Begg N (eds). Immunisation against infectious disease.
