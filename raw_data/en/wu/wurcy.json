How about claiming that the available real Covid-19 vaccines contain \"toxic ingredients\" and then offering fake Covid-19 Vaccine Record Cards to anyone who buys your product? That can make you a bunch of money, right? There's one ityy-bitty problem with such a fake it and make it scheme. It can get you arrested. And cause harm to people. OK, two itty-bitty problems. Arrested and charged is apparently what's happened to Julie Mazi, a licensed naturopath based in Napa, California. [According to Jennifer Huffman writing for the Napa Valley Register](https://napavalleyregister.com/news/local/napa-naturopathic-doctor-charged-with-faking-covid-vaccines-and-vaccination-cards/article_4b438774-fd7e-5e37-9d8e-11e), Mazi has made such \"toxic ingredient\" claims about the vaccines that over 160 million Americans have already received to become fully vaccinated against Covid-19. This \"naturopathic healer\" has reportedly been trying to discredit the vaccines that have undergone extensive testing and have received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). But that's not all. Take a look at this KPIX CBS news segment: As you can see, Mazi has allegedly been getting her patients to buy products that have not received any authorization from the FDA: namely her \"homeoprophylaxis immunization pellets.\" in the Joffrey Baratheon are these? Well, \"pellets\" are any small, rounded mass of a substance such as food or the stuff that comes out of gerbils' butts. So if someone want to give you pellets to consume, you'd best ask, \"pellets of what\" and \"why is that gerbil laughing?\" The second word \"immunization\" means make someone immune to infection. However, the first word may be a bit of a mystery. [Searching dictionary.com for the word \"homeoprophylaxis\"](https://www.dictionary.com/misspelling?term=homeoprophylaxis) yields the following: \"No found for homeoprophylaxis\" and \"did you mean [chemoprophylaxis?\"](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/chemoprophylaxis) Homeoprophylaxis is the controversial idea that ingesting a highly diluted dose of something that causes a disease can stimulate your immune system to confer immunity against that disease. It's controversial because there really isn't enough scientific evidence that such an approach works to protect you against something like Covid-19. The FDA certainly has not authorized the use of \"homeoprophylaxis immunization pellets\" or any pellets for that matter for protection against Covid-19. Yet, according to prosecutors, Mazi has claimed that her pellets contain very small amounts of the Covid-19 virus and that consuming such pellets could offer \"lifelong immunity\" against Covid-19. Hmm, how could you possibly say \"lifelong\" when the pandemic hasn't even been around for more than a year and a half, unless you mean something like \"gerbil-lifelong?\" Mazi has reportedly made such claims for not only adults but children including babies as well. Prosecutors have also said that Mazi provided fake Covid-19 Vaccination Record Cards to patients who bought her pellets. These Record Cards indicated that her patients had received doses of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine, even though they didn't. This would be like getting a driver's license after simply eating a bowl of macaroni-and-cheese. Now, you may wonder why the word \"prosecutors\" is being used here. After all, you don't tend to mention prosecutors when referring to everyday things such as \"prosecutors are saying that you ate my wheel of cheese\" or \"prosecutors are saying that you watched the movie Avatar seven times, which is seven times too many.\" No, prosecutors are involved in this Napa situation because Mazi is being charged with one count of wire fraud and one count of making false statements related to health care matters. Here's a tweet from the Office of Inspector General at the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services: With so much misinformation about Covid-19 out there, you've got to wonder how much of it is being motivated by specific agendas or maybe even multiple \"gendas.\" For example, when someone tells you that Covid-19 vaccines don't work or are harmful, what might they be offering as an alternative? Are they trying to get you to buy some kind of supplement, pellet, or magical potion instead? It is a common ploy in business and dating to try to discredit your competition. So it's not surprising that people pushing pellets and other pseudoscience would try to take down established science-based vaccines. It's one thing though if you make false claims about a handbag or a murse. It's something totally different if you make false claims about a health product. The latter can cause people real harm. Even when a fraudulent health product doesn't have side effects, it can keep people from getting real and appropriate health products and services such as vaccines. When someone claims that Covid-19 vaccines have \"toxic ingredients\" without providing real scientific evidence, what's really toxic are the claims themselves. "}
