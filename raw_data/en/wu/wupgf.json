One of the treatments a chiropractor offers for neck pain is spinal adjustments. They move the neck in safe ways to reduce pain and stiffness. This article will discuss the benefits, downsides, and techniques for chiropractic care for neck pain. SDI Productions / Getty Images Benefits of Chiropractic Care for Neck Pain Chiropractic care is a type of complementary medicine that uses a holistic approach to treating illness. Chiropractors use spinal adjustments, electrical stimulation, heat/ice, and general wellness advice to treat their patients. One of the greatest benefits of chiropractic care for neck pain is pain relief without medication. A 2012 study found that spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) was more effective than medication in providing pain relief. The other benefit of chiropractic care for neck pain is that treatment may improve neck mobility and range of motion. It can also increase the movement of surrounding muscles. The ultimate benefit is decreased neck pain and increased neck movement. The Safety of Chiropractic Adjustments Types of Neck Pain There are numerous types of neck pain. Someone can have mild pain or stiffness, neck muscle injuries, or skeletal issues that cause pain. These can lead to other symptoms, such as headaches, difficulty sleeping, and trouble performing daily activities. Chiropractic care may treat these issues through adjustment, massage, or other methods. Downsides of Chiropractic Care for Neck Pain Chiropractic care offers many benefits for relieving neck pain, and there are a few downsides to the practice. Not every condition or injury that causes neck pain should be treated by a chiropractor because the scope of their practice is limited. People who have neck pain caused by bone fractures, severe arthritis, infections, or severe osteoporosis should see a medical doctor for evaluation and treatment. A rare side effect of neck manipulation is blood vessel damage or stroke. There is also the risk that it can worsen the injury or condition. Chiropractors will ask questions to determine a person's risk for treatment side effects. Make sure to provide an accurate health history to give the chiropractor the whole picture. What Happens During a Chiropractic Adjustment for Neck Pain? The first time someone goes to a chiropractor for neck pain, the chiropractor will ask about their health history and goals for treatment. They will want to know about: Current health issues Past health problems Current medications and supplements Diet and lifestyle Alcohol or tobacco use After taking a thorough health history, the chiropractor will perform a physical exam. This could include examining spinal mobility, neck curvature, range of motion, and muscle development. The chiropractor may order diagnostic imaging like an X-ray to further evaluate the neck pain. If the chiropractor determines that manual manipulation (using their hands to adjust joints) is necessary, they will have you either sit upright or lay on a padded table. They will then use their hands to rotate or stretch the neck. This may make a popping or cracking sound. Chiropractors may perform a neck adjustment with instruments like an activator-adjusting instrument. This is a small, handheld instrument that uses fast, low-force pressure on the neck joints to regain range of motion. Needing more than one session to correct neck pain is typical. Chiropractic treatments can run for several weeks, starting with two or three sessions per week. As the neck pain improves, session frequency will decrease. Other Techniques Besides Chiropractic Neck Adjustments Chiropractors are known for their spinal adjustments but can also perform other treatments to alleviate neck pain. Other common treatments chiropractors perform include: Massage Cold and heat therapy Stretching Nutrition counseling Exercise advice Electrical stimulation Where to Get Chiropractic Care for Neck Pain Chiropractors work in many different kinds of healthcare settings. They can be in a private practice clinic setting or in hospitals. Finding a chiropractor who is covered by insurance and considered in-network may decrease out-of-pocket expenses. To do this, contact your medical insurance company and ask for a list of covered chiropractors in your area. Many insurance companies have this information on their website as well. First Visit to the Chiropractor The first visit to any healthcare provider, including a chiropractor, can cause anxiety and make people feel afraid. This is a normal response. To help ease these worries, go to the appointment with a written list of questions and concerns. When people are put on the spot, they can often forget their questions. Another way to ease fears is to research the chiropractor before the visit. Find out how long they have been practicing and what licensing they hold. Alternatives to Try for Continuing Neck Pain Neck pain that continues after chiropractic care needs to be evaluated by a medical doctor. The pain may result from an issue that needs additional attention that a chiropractor cannot provide. Alternatives to chiropractic care can include: Massage Medication Physical therapy Rest Rehabilitation exercise Summary Chiropractors are healthcare providers who take a holistic, conservative approach to neck pain treatment. They may use manual manipulation, massage, or one of their many other techniques to treat neck pain and help restore neck mobility. Based on the type of neck injury or condition, chiropractic care may not be the right medical treatment. It's important to take into account the type of neck injury, a chiropractor's experience, and if insurance covers their costs when choosing the right provider. 5 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.
