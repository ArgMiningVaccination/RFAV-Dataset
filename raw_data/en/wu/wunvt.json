She also offers numerous practical examples of its application and suggestions for treating patients at home. Anthroposophic medicine is an integrative system of medicine that combines scientific training and practice with a spiritual understanding of the human being. It primarily stimulates self-healing forces and directly supports recovery processes and innate capacities of resistance. Anthroposophic physicians\u2014who are registered general practitioners and specialists\u2014utilize the knowledge and skills of conventional treatments, anthroposophic and homoeopathic medicines, external applications, as well as eurythmy, arts, and physical therapies. Dr. Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler describes the current status of anthroposophic medicine and raises awareness of the social dimension of illness and health to address issues of fate and destiny and to show what individuals can do for their own health and that of others. She reflects on Steiner's call to \"make the health system democratic\" and clarifies why scientific pluralism of methods and freedom of therapy are essential for the future development of healthcare systems and today's understanding of diseases.
