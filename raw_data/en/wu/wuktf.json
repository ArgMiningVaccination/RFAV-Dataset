The least restrictive measures will be used to ensure patient and staff safety. Restrictive interventions shall be discontinued as soon as it is safe for the patient and staff. PURPOSE: The purpose of the Physical Restraints - Acute Unit policy is to ensure the use of restraints maintain a safe environment, prevents injury, and maintains dignity of patients and staff in the Laguna Honda Hospital (LHH) Acute Units (Acute Medical and Acute Rehab). The Acute Rehab unit is also known as the Inpatient Rehabilitation Faci lity (IRF). OVERVIEW: The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) defines patient's rights and choices regarding restraints. The CMS Condition of Participation standard in relation to restraint use states: \"Each patient has the right to be free from all form s of abuse and corporal punishment. Each patient has the right to be free from restraint or seclusion, of any form, imposed as a means of coercion, discipline, convenience, or retaliation by staff. Restraint or seclusion may not be used unless the use of restraint or seclusion is necessary to ensure the immediate physical safety of the patient, a staff member, or others. The use of restraint or seclusion must be discontinued as soon as possible based on an individualized patient assessment and re-evaluation.\" The decision to use a restraint must be determined based on a comprehensive patient assessment and documented. Once it is decided to use restraint, the least restrictive form of restraint that protects the physical safety of the patient or staff must be used. Restraints may not be used unless it is necessary for the immediate safety of the patient or staff. Restraining a patient because it is convenient is not acceptable. Less restrictive measures must be considered prior to placing a patient in physic al restraints. The patient's condition must be monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure the use of restraint is discontinued at the earliest possible time. The decision to discontinue the restraint should be made as soon as the unsafe situation ends or the patient's needs can be met with the use of less restrictive measures. DEFINITIONS Restraint: any manual method, chemical, physical or mechanical device, material, or equipment that immobilizes or reduces the ability of a patient to move his or her arms, legs, body, or head freely. File: 22-07 A02 Physical Restraints - Acute Units New December 13, 2022 Laguna Honda Hospital -wide Policies and Procedures Page 2 of 8 Methods: Mechanical Restraints: use of environmental equipment that indirectly impedes movement. Full side rails (use of 2 of 2 full side rails or 4 of 4 half rails) in an up position, or seat belts or alarm belts that cannot be removed by the patient, for the purpose of preventing a patient from falling, wandering, or eloping are considered restraints. Physical Hold (manual restraint): Physical holds are not permitted in the LHH Acute Units. Holding a patient in a manner that restr icts their movement against their will is considered a restraint. Physical Restraint: any externally applied device used to restrict or manage a patient's behavior or freedom of movement, with the intent of preventing injury to self and/or others and facilitate treatment . Chemical Restraint: A drug or medication used to restrict or manage the patient's behavior or restrict the patient's freedom of movement and is not a standard treatment or dosage for the patient's condition. Drugs that are used as par t of a patient's standard medical or psychiatric treatment and are administered within the standard dosage for the patient's condition are not considered a chemical restraint. Classifications: Violent or self -destru ctive Restraint (Behavioral Restraint): Violent or self - destructive restraints are not used in the LHH Acute Units. The restriction of patient movement or voluntary escape from a location for the management of violent or self-destructive behavior that jeopardizes the immediate physical safety of the patient, a staff member, or others unrelated to the medical diagnosis . Non-violent or non- self-destructive Restraint (Medical Safety Restraint): The restriction of patient movement for the purpose of immediate patient safety related to medical diagnosis and/or maximizing medical treatment(s). This criterion only applies to restraint use . Seclusion: Seclusion is not used in the LHH Acute Units. The involuntary confinement of a person alone in an area within a patient care unit where the person is physically prevented from leaving. EXCLUSIONS A restraint does not include devices or other methods for the purpose of conducting routine physical examinations, therapeutic procedures, or tests. Any measure or intervention that can be intentionally removed by the patient in the same manner it was applies is not considered a restraint. Mechanical Support: devices used to achieve proper body position, balance, or alignment so as to allow greater freedom of mobility than would be possible without the use of such a mechanical support is not considered a restraint. Abdominal binders used as abdominal support post -operatively or to promote mobilization (e.g., prevention of orthostatic hypotension or pain) are not restraints. File: 22-07 A02 Physical Restraints - Acute Units New December 13, 2022 Laguna Honda Hospital -wide Policies and Procedures Page 3 of 8 Posit ioning/Securing Device: Such devices used to maintain the position, limit mobility, or temporarily immobilize the patient during medical, dental, diagnostic, or surgical procedures is not considered a restraint. Physical escort: a physical escort using a \"light\" grasp (from which the patient can easily escape) to escort the patient to a desired location is not considered a physical restraint. Physical hold for medication: the touching and securing of a patient for a therapeutic consented injection or procedure is not considered a restraint. Stretcher/gurney/hospital bed side rails: elevated and/or highly mobile carts, with all side rails up, used to transport patients or to treat or evaluate patients are not considered restraints. Raising fewer than 4 (of 4) side rails when the bed has segmented side rails is not considered a restraint. Medications: medications prescribed for the treatment of a patient's medical or psychiatric condition, or to facilitate diagnostic or therapeutic interventions are n ot considered restraints. Law enforcement intervention: the use of law -enforcement designated restrictive devices applied by contracted law enforcement officials for custody, detention, and public safety reasons are not considered restraints. Timeout: an intervention in which the patient consents to being alone in a designated area for an agreed upon timeframe from which the patient is not physically prevented from leaving. The patient can leave the designated area when the patient chooses. Timeout is not considered seclusion. PROCEDURE: 1. Restraint Practice Specifications a. Least restrictive intervention: restraint may be used only when least restrictive interventions have been determined to be ineffective to protect the patient, a staff member, or others from harm. The least restrictive interventions do not always need to be attempted, but they must be considered and determined by staff to be ineffective. This determination may be made by the physician with input from the registered nurse. i. Alternatives attempted must be documented in the electronical medical record (EHR) with the initial application of restraints (not with every order renewal). ii. Least restrictive interventions include, but are not limited to: diversionary activities, 1:1 patient care, repositioning, pain management, reorientation to surroundings, or administration of prescribed medications 2. Restraint Application a. The type or technique of restraint used must be the least restrictive intervention that will be effective to protect the patient, staff member, or others from harm. File: 22-07 A02 Physical Restraints - Acute Units New December 13, 2022 Laguna Honda Hospital -wide Policies and Procedures Page 4 of 8 b. The physical restraint application procedure involves all of the following components: i. Restraint consent ii. Restraint application order iii. Patient monitoring and provision of care iv. Documentation v. Modification to care plan vi. Discontinuation, reapplication and supervised interruptions c. Restraint consent i. Consent must be obtained prior to restraint application . ii. Complete consent for Physical Restraint. Consents must include discussion with patient or patient representative regarding: Education on the risk of removing, repositioning or retying restraint Type of restraint, duration of use and discontinuation cri teria Possible benefits and risks of using or not using restraints Rights of the patient or patient representative to accept or refuse the use of restraints at any time. 3. Restraint application orders a. Physician order is required for all restraints when: i. A restraint intervention is to b e initiated; ii. The original order has expired, and the continued use of restraints is necessary; iii. The rationale for the restraint or type of restraint has changed from the current order; or iv. The restraint needs to be reapplied after it has been discontinued b. Restraint orders must be written prior to restraint application. c. Orders involving the restraint of extremities must specify laterality (e.g., LUE, RUE, LLE, RLE) d. The ordering Physician is accountable for evaluating the need for restraints and completing the restraint order e. Each restraint order is valid only for the specific occurrence of application and cannot be treated as a standing order nor as a PRN (as needed) order. f. Restraint use for non- violent, non- self-destructive (medical safety) purposes must be renewed as needed at least every 24- hours. File: 22-07 A02 Physical Restraints - Acute Units New December 13, 2022 Laguna Honda Hospital -wide Policies and Procedures Page 5 of 8 g. All orders for restraint use require a face- to-face assessment by a Physician documented in the electronic health record. Restraint episodes classified as Non- violent or Non- self destructive require a face- to-face assessment within 24 hours of restraint initiation or order renewal. h. The Physician must evaluate: i. The patient's immediate situation; ii. The patient's reaction to the intervention; iii. The patient's medical and behavioral condition; and iv. The need to continue or terminate the restraint 4. Monitoring and Provision of Care PROVISION OF CARE FREQUENCY OF MONITORING FOR NON- VIOLENT OR NON -SELF -DESTRUCTIVE RESTRAINTS Observation Every 2 -hours , as needed or more frequently if indicated Physical comfort NA Exhibited behavior NA Elimination, food/meal, fluids Every 2 -hours Circulation check Every 2 -hours Range of motion (ROM) Every 2 -hours Vital signs Every 4 -hours , as needed , or more frequently if indicated RN Assessment: Psychological Status and Justification for Continued Restraint Use Every 2 -hours 5. Documentation R equirements a. Restraint documentation requirements will be completed in the electronic health record. b. Nursing Assistants (CNA, PCA, PCT, HHA) may complete monitoring docu mentation excluding the Registered Nurse (RN) Assessment. c. Record a description of the patient's behavior prior to restraint application and the interventions used d. Record alternatives or other less restrictive interventions attempted prior to restraint appl ication (as applicable) File: 22-07 A02 Physical Restraints - Acute Units New December 13, 2022 Laguna Honda Hospital -wide Policies and Procedures Page 6 of 8 e. Record the clinical justification for restraint, the type of restraint used, the time of initiation and discontinuation of the restraints, and the monitoring/frequent provisions of care (e.g., circulation check, ROM, etc.) f. Record th e Physician face -to-face medical and behavioral evaluation within 24 hours for Non- violent or Non -self-destructive restraints g. Record the patient's response to the intervention(s) used, including the rationale for the continued use of the intervention. 6. Modi fication to Care Plan a. Each episode of restraint application and discontinuation will be reflected in the restraint care plan b. Care plan components include: i. Interventions to remain free from injury while restrained ii. Interventions to progress towards removal of restraints 7. Discontinua tion, Reapplication and Temporary Release/Interruption a. Restraints are discontinued at the earliest possible time, such as when the patient no longer presents a risk to him/herself or others or when the risk of restraints outweigh the risk of alternative i nterventions. b. A physician order is required to discontinue an ordered restraint intervention prior to the ordered expiration time. c. Any restraints removed for any reason for any length of time other than during or for temporary release/interruption (e.g., f eeding, ROM, toileting, etc.) is considered a discontinuation of the restraint. d. Any trained member of the clinical team may physically apply and remove restraints. 8. Considerations a. Restraint use is not without risks. Restraints have the potential to cause physical and ps ychological harm, loss of dignity, traumatization/re- traumatization and even death. Pressure injury formation, hypostatic pneumonia, constipation, incontinence, contractures, and neurovascular impairment can result from the enforced immobility that results from using restraints. Altered sensory perception and thought processes may also result. Humiliation, fear, anger and a decreased sense of self -esteem may occur. File: 22-07 A02 Physical Restraints - Acute Units New December 13, 2022 Laguna Honda Hospital -wide Policies and Procedures Page 7 of 8 b. When restraints are needed, consider cultural and symbolic perspectives of restraint use to t he patient/family. c. Restrained older adults respond with anger, fear, humiliation, demoralization, discomfort, and resignation. d. Educate the patient/family/visitors not to remove, reposition or retie restraints. 9. Education a. LHH trains clinical staff with direct patient contact in appropriate restraint use. b. Individuals providing staff training in restraint have education, training, and experience in techniques used to address patient behaviors that necessitate the use of rest raint. The hospital documents in staff records that restraint training and competency were completed. c. Clinical staff competence is assessed at orientation, before participating in use of restraint, and with annual review and assessment of competency. d. Staff involved in use of restraints have, at minimum, a working knowledge of policy and must be able to: i. Identify staff and patient behaviors, events, and environmental factors that may trigger circumstances that require the use of restraint. ii. Identify and provide nonphysical intervention skills. iii. Select and utilize least restrictive intervention based on an assessment of the patient's medical or behavioral status or condition. iv. Safely apply and use all types of restraint used in the hospital, including completi ng training in how to recognize and respond to signs of physical and psychological distress. v. Identify specific behavioral changes that indicate that restraint is no longer necessary. vi. Monitor and provide the physical and psychological care of the patient w ho is restrained. vii. Educate patient and families on the use and discontinuation of restraints. 10.

DEFINITIONS : 1. \"Trauma \" results from an event, series of events, or set of circumstances that is experienced by an individual as physically or emotionally harmful or life threatening and that has lasting adverse effects on the individual's functioning and mental, physical, social, emotional, or spiritual well -being. Common sources of trauma may include, but are not limited to: a. Natural and human caused disasters b. Accidents c. War d. Physical, sexual, mental, and/or emotional abuse (past or present) e. Rape f. Violent crime g. History of imprisonment h. History of homelessness i. Traumatic life events (death of a loved one, personal illness, etc.) 2. \"Trauma -Informed Care \" is an approach to delivering care that involves understanding, recognizing and responding to the effects of all types of trauma. A trauma -informed approach to care delivery recognizes the widespread impact and signs and symptoms of trauma in residents, and incorporates knowledge abo ut trauma into care plans, policies, procedures and practices to avoid re-traumatization. 3. \"Culture \" is the conceptual system that structures the way people view the world\u2014 it is the set of beliefs, norms, and values that influence ideas about the nature of relationships, the way people live their lives, and the way people organize their world. 4. \"Cultural competency \" is a developmental process in which individuals or institutions achieve increasing levels of awareness, knowledge, and skills along a cultural co mpetence continuum. Developing c ultural competence involves the on- going process of: valuing diversity, conducting self -assessments, avoiding stereotypes, managing the dynamics of difference, acquiring and institutionalizing cultural knowledge, and adapting to diversity and cultural contexts in communities. 5. \"Health Equity \" is the state in which everyone has a fair and just opportunity to attain their highest level of health. File: 24-04 Trauma Informed Car e New December 13, 2022 Laguna Honda Hospital -wide Policies and Procedures Page 2 of 3 PROCEDURE: 1. The facility will work to facilitate the implementation of trauma informed care based on the following trauma- informed principles : a. Understanding Stress and Trauma: Understanding trauma and stress allows actions with compassion and leads to well -informed st eps toward wellness. b. Cultural Humility and Responsiveness: Understanding that all residents come from diverse social and cultural groups that may experience and react to trauma differently allows for responding sensitively so that residents may feel under stood and enhance wellness . c. Safety and Stability: Trauma unpredictably violates our physical, social and emotional safety resulting in a sense of threat and need to manage risks. Increasing stability in our residents' daily lives and having these core safety needs met can minimize their stress reactions and allow to focus on our resources on wellness. d. Compassion and Dependability: Trauma is overwhelming and can leave residents feeling isolated or betrayed, which may make it difficult to trust others and receive support. When residents experience compassionate and dependable relationships, they may reestablish trusting connections with others that foster mutual wellness. e. Peer support and mutual self -help - If practicable, assist the resident in locating and arranging to attend support groups (potentially hosted by the facility) which are organized by qualified professionals. f. Collaboration and Empowerment - Trauma involves a loss of power and control that makes us feel helpless. When residents are prepared fo r and given opportunities to make choices for themselves and their care, they may feel empowered and can advocate for their own wellness. It also places an emphasis on partnering between residents and/or his /her/their representative, and all staff and disc iplines involved in the resident's care in developing the plan of care. g. Resilience and Recovery: Trauma can have a long- lasting and broad impact on residents' lives that may create a feeling of hopelessness . When residents are able to focus on their stren gths and clear steps, they can take toward their wellness they are more likely to be resilient and recover. 2. The facility will use a multi- pronged approach to identifying a resident's history of trauma, as well as his /her/their cultural preferences. This will include asking the resident about triggers that may be stressors or may prompt recall of a previous traumatic event, as well as screening and assessment tools such as the Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI), Admission Asse ssment, the history and physical, the social history/assessment, and others. 3. If the resident is non- English speaking, the facility will identify how communication will occur with the resident. If indicated, language assistance services will be arranged for the resident. The care plan will identify the language spoken and tools used to communicate (See Culturally Competent Care Policy). File: 24-04 Trauma Informed Car e New December 13, 2022 Laguna Honda Hospital -wide Policies and Procedures Page 3 of 3 4. The facility will collaborate with resident s who have experienced trauma, and as appropriate, the resident's family, friends, the primary care physician, and any other health care professionals (such as psychologists and mental health professionals) to develop and implement individualized care plan interventions. 5. In some cases, if the facility has more than one resident who experienced trauma, social services will make a good faith effort at establishing a support group that is run by a qualified professional or allow a support group to meet in the facility. If a group cannot be run/meet at facility, social services will assis t the resident in locating a support group in the community as appropriate and feasible. 6. The facility will identify triggers which may re -traumatize residents with a history of trauma. Trigger -specific interventions will identify ways to decrease the resi dent's exposure to triggers which re- traumatize the resident, as well as identify ways to mitigate or decrease the effect of the trigger on the resident and will be added to the resident 's care plan. While most triggers are highly individualized, some comm on triggers may include, but are not limited to: a. Experiencing a lack of privacy or confinement in a crowded or small space. b. Exposure to loud noises, or bright/flashing lights. c. Certain sights, such as objects that are associated with their abuser. d. Sounds, s mells, and physical touch. 7. Trauma- specific care plan interventions will recognize the interrelation between trauma and symptoms of trauma such as substance abuse, eating disorders, depression, and anxiety. These interventions will also recognize the resident's need to be respected, informed, connected, and hopeful regarding their own recovery. 8. The facility will evaluate whether the interventions have been able to mitigate (or reduce) the impact of identified triggers on the resident that may cause re-traumatization. The resident and/ or his /her/their family or representative will be included in this evaluation to ensure clear and open discussion and better understand if interventions must be modified. 9. The facility will engage the services of an interpreter to monitor or evaluate the effect of cultural interventions for non- English speaking residents. 10. In situations where a resident who experienced trauma is reluctant to share their history, the facility will still try to identify triggers which may re -traumatize the resident, and develop care plan interventions which minimize or eliminate the effect of the trigger on the resident ATTACHMENT : NONE REFERENCE : What is Health Equity? | Health Equity | CDC Trauma Transformed- Overview of Trauma Informed Systems 1 of 8 OVERDOSE PREVENTION POLICY: Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabilit ation Center (LHH) prot ects and promotes the health of all residents.

Be it ordained by the People of the City and County of San Francisco: Section 1. Findings. (a) According to data from the Office of the Medical Examiner , the number of people who have died from drug overdoses in San Francisco has been rising at a staggering rate. In 2017, 222 people in San Francisco died from a drug overdose. In 2020, 697 people in San Francisco died from a drug over dose. This represents more than a tripling of the death rate in only three years, su ch that deaths from drug overdoses now average nearly two a day, and nearly 60 a month. (b) Fentanyl, which is estimated to be 50 to 100 times more pot ent than morphine, entered the San Francisco market around 2015, causing eleven deaths that year. In 2016, the number of f entanyl overdose deaths in San Francisco doubled, reaching a total of 22. In 2020, 502 people were reported to have died in San Francisco as a result of overdose from use of fentanyl. Thus, in five years, fentanyl overdose deaths in San Francisco increased by 4500%. (c) This is a public health crisis of major pro portions that is out of control. The number of people who died from a drug ov erdose in San Francisco in 2020 was more than three times the number of people who died in San Francisco from COVID-19 that same year. (d) Based on data showing the addresses of fa tal drug overdoses in San Francisco over the first eight months of 2020, 111 people died on sidewalks or alleys, or in parks or cars; 296 people were found dead in homes or hotels, many in supportive housing in the Tenderloin; and 60 people were pronounced dead at hospitals. (e) Consuming drugs alone while shelteri ng-in-place during the COVID-19 pandemic almost certainly amplified t he overdose death risk of strong drugs; more than half of the 561 deaths from accidental overdoses dur ing the period January - October 2020 occurred and Procedures Page 5 of 8 (f) A 2019 study published in Drug and Alco hol Dependence surveyed overdose mortality among residents of single room o ccupancy (SRO) buildings in San Francisco during the period 2010 - 2017, and found that overdose mort ality was substantially higher among SRO residents as compared to non-SRO residents, and that SRO residents were also more likely to die from overdosing at home than elsewhere. (g) A 2019 study published in the Journal of Urban Health examined the acceptability, feasibility, and implementati on of the Tenant Overdose Response Organizers (TORO) program facilitated in ten SROs in Canada. That study concluded that the overdose response interventions used by the TORO program, including peer-led overdose prevention and response trainings, wall-m ounted naloxone for emergency response, and peer-led support groups, are effective to ols in addressing overdose risk in SROs. The study also concluded that tenants w ho had participated in t he program and were taught about opioid overdoses were better abl e to respond to overdoses and contribute to wider community responses. This study helped inform the DOPE (Drug Overdose Prevention and Education) Project's SRO initiative in San Francisco. Section 2.

Original adoption: 22/12/13 (Year/Month/Day) File: 72-01 A11 Water 13, 2022 Laguna Honda Hospital -wide Policies and Procedures Page 1 of 4 WATER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM POLICY : It is the policy of this facility to establish water management plans for reducing the risk of legionellosis and other opportunistic pathogens (e.g. Pseudomonas, mycobacteria, and fungi) in the facility's water systems based on nationally accepted standards (e.g., ASHRAE, CDC, EPA). DEFINITIONS: \"Control limits\" are the maximum value, minimum value, or range of values that are acceptable for the control measures being monitoring to reduce the risk for Legionella growth and spread. \"Control measures\" are things done in the building water systems to limit growth and spread of Legionella, such as heating, adding disinfectant, or cleaning. \"Control points\" are locations in the water systems where a control measure can be applied. \"Definite healthcare- associated Legionnaires' disease\" refers to a case of Legionnaires' disease in a resident who spent the entire 10 days prior to onset of illness in the facility. \"Legionellosis\" refers to two clinically and epidemiologically distinct illnesses: Legionnaires' disease, which is typically characterized by fever, myalgia, cough, and clinical or radiographic pneumonia; and Pontiac fever, a m ilder illness without pneumonia (e.g., fever and muscle aches). Legionellosis is caused by Legionella bacteria. \"Possible healthcare- associated Legionnaires' disease\" refers to a case of Legionnaires' disease in a resident who spent only part of the 10 d ays before symptoms began in the facility. \"Water management plans\" refer to the documents that contain all the information pertaining to the development and implementation of the facility's water management activities for reducing risk of Legionella and other opportunistic pathogens. PROCEDURE: 1. A water management (WM) team has been established to develop and implement the facility's water management program, including facility leadership, the Infection File: 72-01 A11 Water Management Program New December 13, 2022 Laguna Honda Hospital -wide Policies and Procedures Page 2 of 4 Preventionist, maintenance employees, safety officers, risk and quality management staff, and C hief Nursing Officer. a. Key team members have been educated on the principles of an effective water management program, including how Legionella and other water -borne pathogens grow and spread. Education is consistent with each team member's role. b. The water management team has access to water treatment professionals, environmental health specialists, and state/local health officials. 2. LHH will employ outside expert water management services to assist/consult with the WM program, provide professional assessment s and make recommendations, as well as educate staff on options for remediation as appropriate. 3. The Maintenance Director maintains documentation that describes the facility's water system. A copy is kept in the water management program binder and/or on the web based platform. 4. A risk assessment will be conducted by the water management team annually to identify where Legionella and other opportunistic waterborne pathogens could grow and spread in the facility's water systems. The risk assessment will consider the following elements: a. Premise plumbing: This includes water system components as described in the documentation of the facility's water system. b. Clinical equipment: This includes medical devices and other equipment utilized in the facility that can spr ead Legionella through aerosols or aspiration. c. At-risk population - This facility's entire population is at risk. High risk areas shall be identified through the risk assessment process. Supporting documentation of any areas or resident population that exh ibit greater risk than the general population shall be kept in the water management program binder. 5. Data to be used for completing the risk assessment may include, but are not limited to: a. Water system schematic/description b. Legionella environmental assessment c. Resident infection control surveillance data (i.e. culture results) d. Environmental culture results e. Rounding observation data f. Water temperature logs g. Water quality reports from drinking water provider (i.e. municipality, water company ) h. Community infection control surveillance data (i.e. health department data) 6. Based on the risk assessment, control points will be identified. The list of identified points shall be kept in the water management program binder/web based platform. 7. Control me asures will be applied to address potential hazards at each control point. A variety of measures may be used, including physical controls, temperature management, disinfectant level control, visual inspections, or environmental testing for pathogens. The m easures shall be specified in the water management program action plan. File: 72-01 A11 Water Management Program New December 13, 2022 Laguna Honda Hospital -wide Policies and Procedures Page 3 of 4 8.

When control limits are not maintained, corrective actions will be taken and documented accordingly. c. Protocols and corrective actions will reflect current industry guidelines (i.e., ASHRAE, OSHA, CDC, EPA). 9. The water management team shall regularly verify that the water management program is being implemented as designed. Auditing assignments will reflect that individuals will not verify the program activity for which they are responsible. 10. The effectiveness of the water management program shall be evaluated no less than annually. Routine infection control surveillance data, water quality data, and rounding data shall be utilized to validate the effectiveness. 11. All cases of healthcare- associated legionellosis or other opportunistic waterborne pathogens shall be reported to local/state health officials, followed by an investigation. a. The Infection Preventionist will investigate all cases of definite healthcare-associated Legionnaires' disease for the source of Legionella. b. The Infection Preventionist will also investigate for t he source of Legionella when two or more possible healthcare- associated Legionnaires' disease are identified. c. Elements of an investigation may include: i. Reviewing medical and microbiology records ii.

Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabi litation Center (LHH) affirms the right of each resident to be free from any restraint impo sed for purposes of discipline or staff convenience, and when not required to tr eat the resident's medical symptoms. 2. LHH supports preventing, r educing, and eliminating the use of restraints and restraint- associated risk through preventive st rategies, alternatives, and process improvements. 3. The least restrictive interventions restraint shall be discontinued as soon as it is safe for the resident and staff regar dless of the scheduled expirati on of the restraint order. 4. Each restraint order is valid only for t he specific occurrence of application and cannot be A restraint order shall not be written as a standing or PRN order. 5. The restraint consent form shall be updated annually. 6. Physical restraints as an intervention do not treat the underlyin g causes of medical symptoms. Therefore, as with other interventions, physical restraints should not be used without also seeking to identify and address the physical or psychological condition causing the medical symptom. 7. Thorough evaluation shall be completed to identify a clear link between physical restraint use and how it benefits the resident by addressing the specific medical symptom. There shall be a ph ysician order reflecting the use and specific medical system being treated. a. The medical record shall reflect the m edical symptoms that s upport the use of the restraint, as well as ongoing assessment s, and resident centered care plans. PURPOSE: To assure resident freedom from physical rest raints whenever possible, and to utilize the least restrictive restraints only when other le ss restrictive means to provide safety have been ineffective. DEFINITIONS: 1. Physical restraint: Any manual method, ph ysical or mechanical device, material, or equipment attached or adjacent to the resi dent's body that he or she cannot easily remove which restricts freedom of move ment or normal access to one's body. File: 22-07 Physical Restraints Revised October 12, 2021 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 2 of 8 a. Freedom of movement: any change in place or position for the body or any part of the body that the person is physically able to control or access. a. b. Remove easily : the manual method and/or physical or mechanical device, material, or equipment can be removed int entionally by the re sident in the same manner as it was ap plied by the staff considering the resident's physical condition and ability to accomp lish his or her objective. (e.g., transfer to a chair, get to the bathroom in time). 2. Bed rail(s) are considered restraints when: a. The bed rail keeps a resident from volunt arily getting out of bed in a safe manner due to his/her physical or cognitive inabil ity to lower the bed rail independently. The purpose is to keep a resident from getting out of bed when he/she wants to get out of bed. a. b. The use of the bed rail re stricts freedom of movement. 3. Chemical restraints are defined as any drug that is used for discipline or convenience and not required to treat medical symptoms 4. Position Change Alarms: alerting devices intended to monitor a resident's movement. The devices emit an audible signal when the re sident moves in criteria ways. a. Alarms are considered restraints when the resident is afraid to move to avoid setting off the alarm. 5. Trunk restraints: include any manual method or physical or mechanical device, material or equipment attached or adjacent to the resident's body that the resident cannot easily remove such as, but not limited to, vest or waist re straints or belts used in a wheelchair that eit her restricts freedom of move ment or access to his or her body. 6. Limb restraints inclu de any manual method or physical or mechanical device, material or equipment that the resident cannot easily remove, that restricts movement of any part of an upper extremity (i.e., hand, arm, wrist) or lower extremity (i.e., foot, leg) t hat either restricts freedom of movement or access to his or her own body. Hand mitts/mittens are included in this category 4.7. Convenience: as the result of any ac tion that has the effect of altering a resident's behavior such that the resident requires a le sser amount of effort or care and is not in the resident's best interest. File: 22-07 Physical Restraints Revised October 12, 2021 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 3 of 8 5.8. Discipline: any action taken by the fa cility for the purpose of punishing or penalizing residents. 6.9. Manual Method: to hold or limit a resident 's voluntary movement by using body contact as a method of physical restraint 7.10. Medical symptom: is defined as an indicati on or characteristic of a physical or psychological condition. 8. Position Change Alarms: alerting devices intended to monitor a resident's movement. The devices emit an audible signal when the re sident moves in criteria ways. Alarms are considered restraints when t he resident is afraid to move to avoid setting off the alarm. 9. . EXCLUSIONS : Mechanical/postural Support: Mechanical/postural support is not considered a restraint. It is used to achieve proper body position, balance, or alignment to allow greater freedom of mobility that would not be possible without the use of the mechanical support STANDARDS / GUIDELINES FOR RESTRAINT USE: 1. Use of physical restraints should be the exception, not the rule. A physical restraint can only be used when least restrictive intervent ions have been tried, documented and determined to be ineffective to protect the resident from harm. to provide safety if less-restrictive interventions have been ineffective. A physician order must be completed via EHR. 2. If the covering physician writes a restrain t order, this shall be communicated to the attending physician . during endorsement . 3.2. The physician must conduct a face-to-face assessment within one calendar day of initiation when initial restraint order is verbal. 4.3. Any manual method or physical or mechan ical device, material or equipment should be classified as a restraint only when it meets the cr iteria of the physical restraint definition (see the definition section above). a. This shall be determined on a case-by-ca se basis by individually assessing each and every manual method or physical or mec hanical device, material or equipment attached or adjacent to the resident's body, and the effect it has on the resident. File: 22-07 Physical Restraints Revised October 12, 2021 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 4 of 8 5.4. Restraints are to be appli ed to permit easy removal in emergency situations (e.g., in the event of a fire or disaster). 6.5. Assessments shall be conducted by following the below steps: a. Determine the resident's cognitive and physical status /limitations. b. Considering the physical re straint definition and incorporat ing the definitions listed above, observe the resident to determine the effect the restraint has on the resident's normal function. Do not focus on the type of device, in tent, or reason behind the use of the device. c. Evaluate whether the resi dent can easily and voluntarily remove the device, material, or equipment. If the resident ca nnot easily and voluntarily remove the restraint, continue with the assessment to determine whether th e device restricts freedom of movement or t he resident's access to his or her own body. 7. Although physical restraints have been tradi tionally used as a fall prevention approach, they have major drawbacks and can contribute to serious injuries. Falls do not constitute self-injurious behavior nor a medical symptom supporting the use of physical restraints. There is no evidence that the use of physical restraints, including bu t not limited to side rails, will prevent, reduce, or eliminate falls. In fact, in some instances, reducing the use of physical restraints may actually decrease the risk of falling. Additi onally, falls that occur while a person is physically restrained o ften result in more severe injuries. 8. While a resident, family member, legal repres entative, or surrogate may request use of a physical restraint, LHH is responsible for ev aluating the appropr iateness of that request, just as they would for any medical treatmen t. As with other medical treatments, such as the use of prescription drugs, a resident, fa mily member, legal representative, or surrogate has the right to refuse treatmen t, but not to demand its use when it is not deemed medically necessary. Prior to empl oying any physical restraint, LHH must perform a prescribed resident assessment to properly identify the resident's needs and the medical symptom the physical rest raint is being employed to address. The legal surrogate or representative cannot give permi ssion to use restraints for the sake of discipline or staff convenience or when the restraint is not nece ssary to treat the resident's medical symptoms. That is, the facility may not use re straints in violation of regulation solely based on a resident, legal surrogate or representative's request or approval. While Federal regulations affirm the resident's right to participate in care planning and to refuse treatment, the regulations do not create the right for a resident, legal surrogate or representative to demand that t he facility use specific medica l interventions or treatment that the facility deems inappropriate. Statutory requirement s hold LHH ultimately accountable for the resident's care and safety, including clinical decisions.\" PROCEDURE: File: 22-07 Physical Restraints Revised October 12, 2021 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 5 of 8 1.

PURPOSE: To assure that acute psychiatric issues or crisis situations are addressed appropriately in a timely manner. DEFINITIONS A psychiatric crisis is an emergency condition in which thoughts, feelings, or actions are seriously disturbed and require immediate therapeutic intervention(s) to prevent injury, deterioration of health, or loss of life. Crises may include violent or destructive behavior, or serious threats of such behavior, aimed at self or others; crises may also include nonviolent behaviors that place an individual in imminent danger (e.g., insistence on leaving \"against medical advice\" even though an individual has no means to provide food, clothing, or shelter). PROCEDURE: 1. LHH Psychiatry providers shall be contacted by a physician when there is a psychiatric crisis. See policy MSPP -D08-03, Access to LHH Psychiatry Services. During regular business hours, LHH Psychiatry Urgent Pager (415- 327-5130) may be contacted. During aft erhours/weekends/holidays, the on -call psychiatrist may be contacted per posted call schedule on the Intranet. 2. If a psychiatric crisis situation occurs or is developing and it is the opinion of Primary Physician, the LHH Psychiatry provider, and/or the C hief Medical Officer (CMO) that the resident cannot be adequately cared for at LHH, the LHH Psychiatry licensed provider shall notify the Psychiatric Emergency Service (PES) clinician/psychiatrist of the day to discuss the case and arrange for an emergency evaluation. Should ZSFG be on diversion status, a local 5150- accepting emergency room via paramedic knowledge of diversion status shall be considered. 3. If a resident (who is NOT LPS conserved) is assessed by a LHH Psychiatry clinician, who is trained and certified by the Department of Public Health in the 5150 process, File: 22-09 Psychiatric Emergencies Revised December 13, 2022 Laguna Honda Hospital -wide Policies and Procedures Page 2 of 2 as a danger to others, or to themselves, or gravely disabled, as a result of a mental disorder, and is in need of a psychiatric evaluation, the LHH 5150 Guideline (Attachment 1) should be f ollowed. 4. If the PES clinician/psychiatrist of the day does not agree to a transfer, or if resident's behavioral needs cannot be adequately cared for at LHH but does not meet 5150 criteria, the case will be referred to the Chief of Psychiatry or Chief Medi cal Officer for immediate consideration. 5. Close observation measures and/or North Mezzanine placement are not intended for residents who are actively suicidal or in imminent danger of harm to themselves or others, except while awaiting urgent evaluation and/or transfer to a higher level of care setting. (Also see LHHPP 24- 10 Close Observation.) 6. If a resident is transferred to Psychiatric Emergency Services (or any medical or psychiatric acute care setting due to a behavioral crisis), a LHH Psychiatry li censed provider must evaluate the resident (either by phone report with clinician/psychiatrist, or by in- person assessment) for behavioral risks, prior to the resident returning to LHH. Both the LHH Psychiatry provider and the attending physician must agre e to the return. The attending physician makes the ultimate decision as to taking the resident back or not. Disputed cases shall be referred to the Chief of Psychiatry or Chief Medical Officer.

Prior to bed rail use, must consider the use of appropriate alternatives (see policy 7) Attachment A). The resident assessm ent must include an evaluation of the alternatives that were attempted prior to the installation or use of a bed rail and how these alternatives failed to meet the resident's assessed needs. Bed rails may only be used after careful assessment by the Resident Care Team (RCT) reviewing the risks and benefits of bed rail use. 2. Safety assessments shall be comple ted for residents who use bed rail(s). 3. A new safety assessment, order, and consent shall be completed when: a. the resident uses a different type of bed; b. there is a change in condition or functional status; and/or c. there are safety concerns with the quarterly assessment and the RCT has discussed continued use of bed rails after reviewing risks and benefits. 4. When the bed rail keeps a resident from vo luntarily getting out of bed in a safe manner due to his/her physical or cogniti ve inability to lower the bed rail independently. They fall under th e definition of a physical re straint. If they are not necessary to treat medical symptoms, and less restrictive interventions have not been attempted and determined to be ineffective, bed rails used as restraints should be avoided . If the bed rail meets the definition of a physical restraint, the hospital-wide policy and procedures outlined in LHHPP 22-07 Physical Restraints shall be followed. 5. Continued bed rail use requires at a minimum, a quarterly bed rail safety assessment by the RCT. 6. Facility Services staff is responsible fo r the proper installation of bed rails and tracking completion of annual preventive maintenance on the bed used by the resident. 6.7. Appropriate Alternatives: Facilitie s must attempt to use appropriate alternatives prior to insta lling or using bed rails. \"Alternatives include roll guards, foam bumpers, lowering the bed and usin g concave mattresses that can help reduce rolling off the bed.\" Additionally, alte rnatives that are attempted should be appropriate for the resident, safe and addres s the medical conditions, symptoms, or behavioral patterns for which a bed rail wa s considered. For example, a low bed or concave mattress may not be an appropria te alternative to enable movement in bed for a resident receiving therapy fo r hip-replacement. If no appropriate alternative was identified, the medical record would have to include evidence of the following: purpose for which the bed rail was intended and evidence that File: 22-13 Bed Rail Use Revised October 12, 2021 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 2 of 4 alternatives were tried and were not su ccessful assessment of the resident, the bed, the mattress, and rail for entrapment risk (which would include ensuring bed dimensions are appropriate for resident si ze/weight), and risks and benefits were reviewed with the resident or resident representative, and in formed consent was given before installation or use . 7. Resident or representative may ch oose to use bed rails per preference. PURPOSE: To ensure safe and appropriate use of bed rails. DEFINITIONS: 1. Entrapment: is an event in which a resi dent is caught, trapped, or entangled in the space in or about the bed rail. 2. Freedom of movement: any c hange in place or position for t he body or any part of the body that the person is physically able to control or access. 3. Bed rails are considered restraints when: a. The purpose is to keep a resident fr om getting out of bed wh en he/she wants to get out of bed. b.a. The use of a bed rail restricts freedom of movement . PROCEDURE: 1. A safety assessment shall be completed by the RCT and documented via electronic health record (EHR) by the Registered Nurse taking into consideration the resident's current medical diagnosis, ph ysical condition (size and we ight), functional ability (bed mobility, transfer, ability to toilet self ), cognition, communication, sleep habits, medication(s), physical and/or behavioral symptoms. 2. For beds with rails that are incorporated or pre-installed, the facility must determine whether or not disab ling the bed rail poses a risk for t he resident. Some considerations would include, but are not lim ited to Could the rail si mply be moved to the down position and tucked under the bed When in t he down position, does it pose a tripping or entrapment hazard? Would it have to be physically remov ed to eliminat e a tripping or entrapment hazard? 1.3. Facilities should follow manufacturers ' recommendations/instructions regarding disabling or tying rails down. If bed rails are not appropriate for the resident and the facility chooses to keep the bed rail on the bed, but in the down position, raising the rail even for episodic use during care would be considered noncompliance if all of the File: 22-13 Bed Rail Use Revised October 12, 2021 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 3 of 4 requirements (assessment, informed consent, appropriateness of bed, and inspection and maintenance) are not met prior to the episodic bedrail use for the resident. 2.4. The safety assessment takes into consideration the following: a. Risk of entrapment, b. Bed's dimensions are appropriate for the resident's size and weight, c. Fall risk, d. Physical restraint assessment, e. Potential negative physical outcomes such as decline in function for activities of daily living and skin integrity issues, and f. Potential negative psycho- social outcomes such as an undignified self-image, low self-esteem, and feelings of isol ation, anxiety or agitation. 5. Use of bed rails shall be or dered by the physician via E HR. Physician will complete consent and nursing staff will scan consent copy to EHR. 3. . What assessed medical needs would be addressed by the use of bed rails; The resident's benefits from the use of bed rails and the lik elihood of these benefits; The resident's risks from the use of bed rails and how these risks will be mitigated. 4.6. The Resident or Resident R epresentative shall consent to bed rail use by signing the informed consent. 5.7. Nursing staff is responsible for notifying Facility Services when they find a bed that is past due for preventive maintenance. 6.8. The RCT is responsible for on-going moni toring and supervision of residents who use bed rails and for conducting a quarterly safety assessment and documenting the assessment in the RCT meeting notes. 7.9. For new admissions, the RCT shall review and consider the alternatives listed under Appendix A and determine if any of t he suggested interventions are appropriate as an alternative to bed rail use.

PURPOSE: To provide strategies that promote healthy behavio r and decrease the short / and long-t term adverse consequences of risk behavior, even for those residents who continue to engage in unsafe practices. SCOPE: Harm reduction methods and treatment goals s hall be used by LHH providers (including contractors), who deliver substance use tr eatment, mental health treatment, sexually transmitted disease (STD), and HIV/AIDS treatment and prevent ion services, and/or who serve residents who use drugs or alcohol. DEFINITION: Harm Reduction : It is a public health philosophy, wh ich promotes methods of reducing the physical, social, emotional, and economi c harms associated with drug and alcohol use and other harmful behaviors on individual s, their family and community. The Harm Reduction model is person-centered and attempts to reach residents \"where they are at,\" to assist them in making choices that l ead toward better health. Harm reduction methods and treatment goals are free of judgment or blame and directly involve the resident in setting their own goals. There is growing evidence in lit erature to indicate that harm reduction approaches greatly r educe morbidity and mortality associated with risky health behaviors. Unhealthy practices : Habits or practices that negatively impact one's health. Some examples include: 1) A resident continues to eat an excessive amount of sweets despite having unstable diabetes; 2) A resident continues to smoke despite having a history of stroke but is doing so off campus; 3) A resi dent continues to drink alcohol despite having liver failure but is not disturbing others. Unsafe practices : Behaviors that negatively im pact the healing environment and recovery of self or others but are not i mminently dangerous. Some examples include: 1) A resident who is HIV positive br ings used needles to the unit, in creasing the risk of needle File: 24-25 Harm Reduction Revised July 9, 2019July 27, 2022 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 2 of 6 stick to others around them; 2) A resident attempts to smoke inside their room; 3) A resident (who is not being aggressive) brings alcohol /drugs or other contraband to the unit and secretly gives itprovides to another other resident s. Imminently dangerous behavior : Behaviors that if not intervened upon immediately, would cause immediate harm to self or others. For example: 1) A resident attempts to smoke, or use lighters, matches , e-cigarettes, and/or other devices that ignite or fuel a flame, in the presence of or near devices that deliver oxygen to persons; 2) a resident is agitated and waving around a broken bottle while intoxicated). Trauma informed System: A service system in which all par ties involved recognize the widespread impact of trauma on t he clients they serve and make s an effort to avoid re- traumatization while providing services. This approach includes the principals of safety, choice, collaboration, trustworthiness and em powerment. Ensuring that the physical and emotional safety of an individual is address ed is the first important step to providing Trauma-Informed Care. Motivational Interviewing: A counseling technique that uses the stages cycle of change to determine readiness, focuses on exploring and resolving ambivalence (sometimes you just have to live with am bivalence and accept it and move on) , and centers on motivational processes within the individual that facilitate change CycleStages of Change: The transtheoretical model posits that health behavior change involves progress through six stages of c hange: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance, and relapse. RATIONALE: Harm reduction is a public health strategy that was developed init ially for adults with substance abuse problems for whom abs tinence was not feasible. People are more responsive to culturally competent, non-judgment al services, delivered in a manner that demonstrates respect for individual dignity, personal strengths, and self -determination. Service providers are responsible to the wi der community for delivering interventions, which attempt to reduce the economic, soci al, and physical consequences of drug and alcohol related harm and harms associated wit h other behaviors or practices that put individuals at risk. Those engaged in unhealthy or uns afe practices are often diffi cult to reach by offering 'traditional services', (e.g. abstinence-or treatment) ther efore, the service continuum must seek creat ive opportunities and develop new strategies to engage, motivate, and intervene with those individual s who are unable or not yet willing to engage File: 24-25 Harm Reduction Revised July 9, 2019July 27, 2022 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 3 of 6 in treatment services. At LHH, this means that comprehensive treat ments need to include strategies that reduce harm for residents w ho come for medical treatment but may be unable or not yet willing to modify their unsafe practices. Relapse or periods of return to unsafe health practices are an expected partstage in the stagescycle of change and shall not be equated with or conc eptualized as \"failure of treatment\", nor as \"failu re of resident.\" Each service area within the system of comprehensive services at LHH can be strengthened by working collaboratively with ot her areas in the system. Harm Reduction methods are most effective when applied consis tently across all services and providers. People change in incremental ways and must be offered a range of treatment outcomes in a continuum of care from reducing uns afe practices (including but not limited to: changes in routes of administration , decrease in frequency of practices, use of alternative substances, or reduction of medical risks from practices) toto the ultimate goal of abstaining from unsafe practices. PROCEDURE: 1. Provision of Services a. Service goals shall be determined thr ough collaboration between the resident and resident representatives, t he staff, and the program, establishing realistic measurements of success, fo r the resident to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosoc ial well-being, in accordance with the comprehensive assessment and plan of care42 CFR \u00a7 483.40. b. Providers shall expand service options within existing programs or collaborate with other service agencies to be able to respond to residents and their special individualized needs. c. As LHH is part of the S an Francisco Health Network and a safety net institution, access to LHH services is allowed ev en for residents who are unable or not yet willing to abstain from unsafe practices on the L HH campus including the designated smoking area, provided that LHH can provide safe and adequate care for the resident. d. Providers shall not deny services to i ndividuals for exhibiti ng behaviors for which they seek or need help. File: 24-25 Harm Reduction Revised July 9, 2019July 27, 2022 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 4 of 6 e. Residents shall not be deni ed access to, restricted fr om participation in, or terminated from , services on the basis of their use of prescribed medicationsil licit substances . f. Provider language shall not reflect bias toward personal behaviors, experiences, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or personal choices. g. Programs shall broaden thei r treatment philosophies in order to provide quality, comprehensive care and coordinate care with other health care serv ice providers. 2. Interventions a. Initiation and Re sident Education i. Clinical interventions shall be i ndividualized based on the safety risk assessment, differentiating approaches for unhealthy practices and unsafe practices. ii. The provider shall: Meet with the resident to ack nowledge and address the resident's unsafe practice(s), assess where the resident is in relation to the stages cycle of change, as well as how their current behavior it relates to the resident'sir recovery goal(s) and goal(s) for t hat session in particular. Provide and document resident education regarding risk of unsafe practice(s) to increase resident aw areness, reduce the risk of negative consequences, and help resident in making an informed decision regarding unhealthy and uns afe habits. Education and training opportunities shall include refe rence to LHH's harm reduction philosophy as appropriate to the educ ation and training content/topic. Education provided shall be documented in electronic health record by the discipline provid ing the education. Utilize the principles in Trauma In formed System through mindfulness and awareness, and recognize personal trauma and triggers, and its impact to present behavior and coping skills. Use a \"what What has happened to you ?\" rather than, \"What's wrong with you?\", perspective in developing plan of care to our residents. II nclude motivational strategies (e .g. motivational interviewing) to explore residents' ambivalence regarding t heir willingness to change,.meanwhilethat reduce File: 24-25 Harm Reduction Revised July 9, 2019July 27, 2022 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 5 of 6 reducing the harm for those residents who are unable to or not yet willing to stop unsafe practices . To explore their ambivalence rega rding the possibility of change. Along with the Resident Care Team (RCT), ensure that clinical interventions and initiated care plans are person-centered and shall take the resident's own goals and valu es into consideration. b. Monitoring and Follow Up i. Providers shall make a reasonable attempt, within the context of their programs, to follow-up with residents who demonstrate an inability or unwillingness to participate in treatm ent, and prior to discharge, make a reasonable attempt to find additional or alternative treatment. ii. Providers shall recognize relapse, or a return to unsafe practices as part of the recovery process, not as a \"failure of treatment\" or \"fa ilure of resident.\" but an anticipated stage in the stagescycle of change. iii. Successes shall be measured to in clude incremental improvement in housing, physical and mental health, finance, employment and family and social support system. iv. In the event that a resident is so impaired and/or unc ooperative to present imminent danger to self or others, th e provider shall follow LHHPP 22-10 Management of Resident Aggression in managing the situation. v. The RCT will conduct a regular eval uation of the resident risk factorsEvaluation of risk factors shall be completed by the RCT at a minimum every quarter, and shall be and discuss ed with the resident or representative during the Resident Care Conference. Quality Assurance Performance measures shall be establishe d to assure implementation, compliance, and continuous improvement in adopt ing harm reduction approach. Documentation audits shall include a mo nthly neighborhood review of residents undergoing a harm reduction prog ram to verify that: c. Harm reduction education was provi ded to the resident and documented. File: 24-25 Harm Reduction Revised July 9, 2019July 27, 2022 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 6 of 6 d. Care plan was initia ted and updated as needed. e. Monthly neighborhood review of harm reduction plans shall be reported to Nursing Quality Improvement Committee. ATTACHMENT: None.

PURPOSE: To establish Policies and Procedures t o ensure that LHH provides necessary behavioral health care and services which include [CMS DHHS SOM (\u00a7483.40)]: a. Ensuring that the necessary care and services are person- centered and reflect the resident's goals for care, while maximizing the resident's dignity, autonomy, privacy, socialization, independence, choice, and safety; b. Ensuring that direct care staff interact and communicate in a manner that promotes mental and psychosocial well -being; c. Providing meaningful activities which promote engagement, and positive meaningful relationships between residents and staff, families, other residents and the community. Meaningful activities are those that address the resident's customary routines, interests, preferences, etc. and enhance the resident's well - being; d. Providing an environment and atmosphere that is conducive to mental and psychosocial well -being; e. Ensuring that pharmacological interventions are only used when non - pharmacological interventions are ineffective or when clinically indicated. DEFINITIONS : 1. Highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well -being This is defined as the highest possible level of functioning and well -being, limited by the individual's recognized pathology and normal aging process. Highest practicable is determined through the comprehensive resident assessment and by recognizing and competently and thoroughly addressing the physical, mental or psychosocial needs of the individual. 2. Mental Disorder Mental disorder is a syndrome characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning. Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress or disability in social, occupational, or other important acti vities. 3. Substance Use Disorder (SUD) File: 24-28 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE AND SERVCES Decembe r 13, 2022 Laguna Honda Departmental Policies and Procedures Page 2 of 10 Substance use disorder is defined as recurrent use of alcohol and/or drugs that causes clinically and functionally significant impairment, such as health problems , disability and failure to meet major responsibilities at work, school, or home. (Adapted from: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) definition found at http://www.samhsa.gov/disorders/substance-use ). 4. Trauma Trauma is defined as results from an event, series of events, or set of circumstances that is experienced by an individual as physically or emotionally harmful or life threatening and that has lasting adverse effects on the individual's functioning and mental, physical, social, emotional, or spiritual well -being. 5. Post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Post- traumatic stress disorder occurs in some individuals who have encountered a shocking, scary, or dangerous situation. Symptoms usually begin early, within three months of the traumatic incident, but sometimes they begin years afterward. Symptoms must last more than a month and be severe enough to interfere with relationships or work to be considered PTSD. 6. Depression : Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how an individual feel s, the way they think and act. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person's ability to function at work and at home. Although people experience losses, it does not necessarily mean that they will become depressed. Depression is not a natural part of aging, however, older adults are at an increased risk. Symptoms may include fatigue, sleep and appetite disturbances, agitation, expressions of guilt, difficulty concentrating, apathy, withdrawal, and suicidal ideation. Late life depression may be harder to identify due to a resident's co gnitive impairment, loss of functional ability, the complexity of multiple chronic medical problems that compound the problem, and the loss of significant relationships and roles in their life. Depression presents differently in older adults and it is the responsibility of the facility to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is established. 7. Anxiety and Anxiety Disorders Anxiety is a common reaction to stress that involves occasional worry about circumstantial events. Anxiety disorders, however, include symptoms such as excessive fear and intense anxiety and can cause significant distress. Anxiety disorders are prevalent among older adults and may cause debilitating symptoms. The distinction between general anxiety and an anxiety disorder is subtle and can be difficult to identify. Accurate diagnosis by a qualified professional is essential. Anxiety can be triggered by loss of function, changes in relationships, relocation, or medical illness. Importantly, anxiety may also be a symptom of other disorders, such as dementia, and care must be taken to ensure that other disorders are not inadvertently misdiagnosed as an anxiety disorder (or vice versa). File: 24-28 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE AND SERVCES Decembe r 13, 2022 Laguna Honda Departmental Policies and Procedures Page 3 of 10 6 . Non-pharmacological Intervention: Non-pharmacological intervention refers to approaches to care that do not involve medications, generally directed towards stabilizing and/or improving a resident's mental, physical, and psychosocial well -being. BACKGROUND: Providing behavioral health care and services is an integral part of the person- centered environment . This involves an interdisciplinary approach to care, with qualified staff that demonstrate the competencies and skills necessary to provide appropriate services to the resident. Individualized approaches to care (including direct care and activities) are provided as part of a supportive physical, mental, and psychosocial environment, and are directed toward understanding, preventing, relieving, and/or accommodating a resident's distress or loss of abilities. 1. Behavioral health encompasses a resident's whole emotional and mental well -being, which includes, but is not limited to, the prevention and treatment of mental and substance use disorders, psychosocial adjustment difficulty, and trauma or post - traumatic stress disorders. 2. The facility will consider the acuity of the resident population. This includes residents with mental disorders, psychosocial disorders, or substance use disorders (SUDs ), and those with a history of trauma and/or post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as reflected in the facility assessment . 3. The facility will ensure that necessary behavioral health care and services are person-centered and reflect the resident's goals for care, while maximizing the resident's dignity, autonomy, privacy, socialization, independence, choice, and safety. 4. Behavioral health care and services shall be provided in an environment that is conducive to mental and psychosocial well -being. 5. Conditions that are frequently seen in nursing home residents and may require the facility to provide specialized services and supports based upon residents' individual needs, include, but are not limited to: a. Depression - It is not a natural part of aging, however, older adults in the nursing home setting are more at risk than older adults in the community . b. Anxiety a nd Anxiety Disorders - There are many types of anxiety disorders, each with different symptoms. The most common types of anxiety disorders include Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Phobias and Post -Traumatic Stress Diso rder. c. Schizophrenia - It is a serious mental disorder that may interfere with a person's ability to think clearly, manage emotions, make decisions and relate to others. It is uncommon for schizophrenia to be diagnosed in a person younger than 12 or older t han 40. d. Bipolar Disorder - It is a mental disorder that causes dramatic shifts in a person's mood or energy, and may affect the ability to think clearly. File: 24-28 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE AND SERVCES Decembe r 13, 2022 Laguna Honda Departmental Policies and Procedures Page 4 of 10 6. All LHH staff have the responsibility to help residents meeting their behavioral health care needs. PROCEDURE: 1. Assessment and Reassessment a. LHH utilizes the comprehensive assessment and reassessment process for identifying and assessing a resident's mental and psychosocial status and providing person- centered care. This process includes, but is not limited to: i. PASARR screening. ii. Obtaining history and prior level of functioning from medical records, the resident, and as appropriate the resident's family and friends, regarding mental, psychosocial, and emotional health. iii. Ongoing monitoring of mood and behavior , including identifying individual resident responses to stressors iv. Care plan development and implementation. v. Evaluation. b. The resident, and as appropriate the resident's family, are included in the comprehensive assessment and reassessment process along with the interdisciplinary team and outside sources, as indicated. 2. Care Planning The care plan shall: a. Have interventions that are person- centered, evidence- based, culturally competent, trauma -informed, and in accordance with professional standards of practice. b. Provide for meaningful activities which promote engagement and positive, meaningful relationships. Residents living with mental health and SUDs may require different activities than other nursing home residents. The facility will ensure that activities are provided to meet the needs of these residents . c. Reflect the resident's goals for care. d. Account for the resident's experiences and preferences. e. Maximize the resident's dignity, autonomy, privacy, socialization, independence, and safet y. f. Use pharmacological interventions only when non- pharmacological interventions are ineffective or when clinically indicated. g. Address any other individualized needs the resident may have related to the mental disorder or the SUD. This includes incorporating behavioral plan recommendations (if any) from LHH Psychiatry providers working with the resident. File: 24-28 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE AND SERVCES Decembe r 13, 2022 Laguna Honda Departmental Policies and Procedures Page 5 of 10 h. Be reviewed and revised as needed, such as when interventions are not effective or when the resident experiences a change in condition. 3. Interventions , Monitoring and Documentation a. LHH Resident Care Teams ( RCT) shall implement person- centered care approaches designed to meet the individual goals and needs of each resident . These may include achiev ing expected improvements or maintaining the expected stable rate of decline based on the progression of the resident's diagnosed condition. b. Individualized, person- centered approaches to care should be implemented based upon the comprehensive assessment, in accordance with the resident's customary daily routine, life- long patterns, interests, preferences, and choices. These shall be implemented to address expressions or indications of distress. Feedback from the the resident, resident's family, and/or representative(s) shall be included when possible. c. The RCT shall be aware of potential underlying causes and/or triggers that may lead to expressions or indications of distress. Identifying the frequency, intensity, duration, and impact of a resident's expressions or indications of distress, as well as the location, surroundings or situation in which they occur, may help the RCT identify individualized interventions or approaches to care to support the resident's needs. d. Individualized, non- pharmacological interventions shall b e developed and implemented to help meet behavioral health needs of all ages . These may include, but are not limited to: i. Ensuring adequate hydration and nutrition (e.g., enhance taste and presentation of food, addressing food preferences to improve appetit e and reduce the need for medications intended to stimulate appetite); ii. Encouraging exercise; iii. Providing pain relief; iv. Individualizing sleep and dining routines; v. Considerations for restroom use, incontinence and increasing dietary fiber to prevent or reduce c onstipation; vi. Adjusting the environment to be more individually preferred or homelike (e.g., using soft lighting to avoid glare, providing areas that stimulate interest or allow safe, unobstructed walking, eliminating loud noises thereby reducing unnecessar y auditory environment stimulation); vii. Assigning staff to optimize familiarity and consistency with the resident and their needs (e.g., consistent caregiver assignment when possible); viii. Supporting the resident through meaningful activities that match his/her individual abilities, interests and needs , based upon the comprehensive assessment, and that may be reminiscent of lifelong work or activity patterns; ix. Assisting the resident outdoors in the sunshine and fresh air (e.g. in a non-smoking area for a non -smoking resident); File: 24-28 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE AND SERVCES Decembe r 13, 2022 Laguna Honda Departmental Policies and Procedures Page 6 of 10 x. Providing access to pets or animals for the resident who enjoys pets (e.g. a cat for a resident who used to have a cat of their own); xi. Assisting the resident to participate in activities that support their spiritual needs; xii. Assisting with the opportunity for meditation and associated physical activity (e.g. chair yoga); xiii. Focusing the resident on activities that decrease stress and increase awareness of actual surroundings, such as familiar activities; offering verbal reassurance, especially in terms of keeping the resident safe; and acknowledging that the resident's experience is real to her/him; xiv. Utilizing techniques such as music, art, electronics/computer technology systems, massage, essential oils , reminiscing; xv. Assisting residents with SUDs to access counseling (e.g., individual or group counseling services, 12- step programs, and support groups ) to the fullest degree possible (see MSPP D08-07 LHH Substance Treatment and Recovery Services). xvi. Assisting residents with access to therapies, such as psychotherapy, behavior modification, cognitive behavioral therapy, and problem solving therapy (see MSPP D08 -03 Access to LHH Psychiatry services) ; and xvii. Providing support with skills related to verbal de- escalation, coping skills, and stress management. e. RCT shall monitor the effectiveness of the interventions, changing those approaches, if needed, in accordance with current standards of practice. Additionally, staff shall accurately document these actions in the resident's medical record and provide ongoing assessment as to whether they are improving or stabilizing the resident's status or causing adverse consequences. f. If indicated, referrals for LHH Psychiatry services can be made (see MSPP D08 - 02 LHH Psychiatry Scope of Services and Organization; MSPP D08 -03 Access to LHH Psychiatry Services). i. Services by LHH Psychiatry providers (and related policies) include: psychotropic medication D01 -05) mental health services (MSPP D08 -09) substance treatment and recovery services (STARS, including Non - specialty outreach and engagement of resident with SUDs and specialty substance treatment, MSPP D08- 07) neuropsychological and psychological testing services (MSPP D08 -08) behavioral management services (including behavioral consultation, behavioral planning, and Health and Behavior Services, MSPP D08 -10) ii. Recommendations from and interventions by LHH Psychiatry providers shall be incorporated into the resident's care plan through collaboration between the RCT and LHH Psychiatry providers. g. The Therapeutic Care Team (TCT) u nder the Behavioral Response Team Department helps create and maintain a safe, equitable, and therapeutic care File: 24-28 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE AND SERVCES Decembe r 13, 2022 Laguna Honda Departmental Policies and Procedures Page 7 of 10 environment for LHH residents and assist staff to recognize early signs and symptoms of escalation and other at -risk behaviors. TCT provides cult urally appropriate, non- violent crisis intervention training, and individualized de- escalation techniques while collaborating with multidisciplinary staff to ensure consistent response from resident care team. TCT collaborates with RCT and LHH Psychiatry team to problem solve around incorporating behavioral management recommendations from Psychiatry providers into care plans as well as intervention implementation. h. Residents who exhibit behaviors which could endanger themselves, other residents, or staff may benefit from a behavioral plan to ensure they are receiving appropriate services and interventions to meet their needs. i. Upon admission of a new resident, the Unit Nurse Manager or designee will determine if the resident's behaviors may benefit from a behavioral plan. ii. Within twenty -four hours of admission, the Unit Nurse Manager or designee should develop an interim behavioral plan, until the comprehensive assessment and care plan are developed. Any behavioral interventions should also be included in the baseline care plan. iii. The interdisciplinary team, including the resident, and as appropriate the resident's family, should develop a behavioral plan with identified behaviors through the RAI (Resident Assessment Instrument) process. iv. Information regarding the resident's usual routine may be gathered from the pre- screening application tool, from the resident and family members, and/or the comprehensive assessment. v. Behaviors should be documented clearly and concisely by facility staff. Documentation should include specific behaviors, time and frequency of behaviors, observation of what may be triggering behaviors, what interventions were utilized, and the outcomes of the interventions. vi. Behaviors should be identified and approaches for modification or redirection should be included in the comprehensive plan of care. vii. The care plan and behavioral plan should be reviewed at least quarterly for continued need of behavior management and appropriate interventions. i. A behavioral plan may include a behavioral contract. If a behavioral contract is used, it will only be used with residents who have the capacity to understand it. A contract will only be used as a method of encouraging the resident to follow their plan of care, and not as a system of reward and punishment. The contract will not conflict with resident rights or other requirements of participation. i. Resident refusal to accept, or non- adherence to the terms of a behavioral contract, will not be the sole basis for a denial of admission, transfer or discharge. ii. A behavioral contract can include a schedule of daily life events, which addresses the individuality of the resident. The contract should reflect the resident's personal preferences and usual routine, to the extent possible. The File: 24-28 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE AND SERVCES Decembe r 13, 2022 Laguna Honda Departmental Policies and Procedures Page 8 of 10 contract should include the recreation schedule, non- pharmacological interventions, and environmental adjustments needed to help the resident meet the resident's highest practicable well -being. iii. If a contract is used, it may also address: 1) The resident's right to have a leave of absen ce and the health and safety risks of leaving without facility knowledge or leaving against medical advice (AMA). 2) Facility efforts to help residents with mental disorder and/or SUD, such as individual counseling services, access to group counseling, or ac cess to a Medication Assisted Treatment program, if applicable. 3) Steps the facility may take if substance use is suspected, which may include: Increased monitoring and supervision in the facility to maintain the health and safety of the resident suspected of substance use, as well as all residents. Restricted or supervised visitation, if the resident's visitor(s) are deemed to be a danger to the resident, other residents, and/or staff. Voluntary drug testing if there are concerns that suspected drug use could adversely affect the resident's condition. Voluntary inspections, if there is reasonable suspicion of possession of illegal drugs, weapons or other unauthorized items which could endanger the resident or others. 4) Referral to local law enforcement for sus picion of a crime in accordance with state laws, such as possession of illegal substances, paraphernalia or weapons. j.

LHH must ensure that pain management is provided to residents who require such services, consistent with professional standards of practice, the comprehensive person-centered care plan, and the residents' goals and preferences. [CMS \u00a7483.25] 2. Pain is regularly assessed and reassessed per the RAI process, as clinically determined by the Licensed Nurse (LN) (see procedure section), and according to the resident's/patient's treatment modalities (see Pain Assessment/Pain Reassessment section). 3. CNAs/PCAs, under the direction of the LN, may assist to monitor the resident's/patient's self-report of pain intensity and possible pain behaviors, and will report these findings to the LN for further pain assessment and management. 4. When pain is identified, an interdisciplinary and individualized pain management plan will be developed as part of the resident's/patient's Pain Care Plan. 5. The Verbal Descriptor Scale is the preferred method for assessing and reassessing pain intensity for residents/patients able to self-report pain and who have the cognitive ability to understand instructions of how to report their pain. 6. LHH utilizes the Pain Assessment IN Advanced Dementia (PAINAD) scale which is the preferred method for assessing and reassessing pain in residents/patients who do not have the functional ability to verbally report their pain, and for residents/patients who do not have the cognitive ability to verbally report their pain. 7. LHH continuously monitors and improves its performance in managing residents'/patients' pain through its Pain Committee and via Performance Improvement activities through its reporting structure up to the PIPS Committee at a minimum of quarterly . 1. Residents have the right to appropriate assessment and management of pain. 2. Pain is regularly (re)assessed assessed and reassessed at a minimum of every shift at a minimum and as clinically indicated (see procedure section) by the Licensed Nurse (see procedure section). 3. When pain is identified, an interdisciplinary and individualized pain management plan is will be developed as part of the resident's Pain care Care planPlan. Complementary therapies will be implemented first for chronic pain.

Pain: a. An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage (APS, 1999; IASP1994). b. There are no biological markers of pain. 2. Acute Pain: a. Follows injury or procedures and generally disappears when the injury heals. b. Generally associated with autonomic nervous system activation (i.e. tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, pallor and mydriasis). c. To defer analgesia until the etiology of acute pain is diagnosed is rarely justifiable (APS, 1999). 3. Chronic Or Persistent Pain (AGS, 2009): a. Pain lasting more than 3 months or beyond the expected time for healing which may or may not have an easily identifiable pathologic basis. 4. Addiction: a. Addiction is a primary, chronic, neurobiologic disease, with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, compulsive use despite harm, and craving (Consensus statement American Academy of Pain Management, American Pain Society and American Society of Addiction Medicine, 2001). 5. Physical Dependence: a. Physical dependence is a state of adaptation that is manifested by a drug class specific withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, decreasing blood level of the drug and/or administration of an antagonist. (Consensus statement American Academy of Pain Management, American Pain Society and American Society of Addiction Medicine, 2001). 6. Tolerance: a. Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug induces changes that result in a diminution of one or more of the drug's effects over time (Consensus File: 25-06 Pain Recognition, Assessment , and Management Revised September 14November 30, 2022, 2021 Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabilitation Center Page 4 of 30 statement American Academy of Pain Management, American Pain Society and American Society of Addiction Medicine, 2001). PROCEDURE: A. Pain Recognition Assessment 1. In order to help the resident/patient attain or maintain his/her highest practicable level of physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being, and to prevent or manage pain, the facility will: a. Recognize when the resident/patient is experiencing pain and identify circumstances when the pain can be anticipated. b. Evaluate the resident/patient for pain and the cause(s) upon admission, during ongoing scheduled assessments, and when a significant change in condition or status occurs (e.g., after a fall, change in behavior or mental status, new pain or an exacerbation of pain). c. Manage or prevent pain, consistent with the comprehensive assessment and plan of care, current professional standards of practice, and the resident's/patient's goals and preferences. 2. RCT staff will observe for nonverbal indicators which may indicate the presence of pain. These indicators include but are not limited to: a. Change in gait (e.g., limping), skin color, vital signs (e.g., increased heart rate, respirations, and/or blood pressure), perspiration b. Loss of function or inability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) (e.g., rubbing a specific location of the body, or guarding a limb or other body parts) c. Fidgeting, increased or recurring restlessness d. Facial expressions (e.g., grimacing, frowning, fright, or clenching of the jaw) e. Behaviors such as: resisting care, distressed pacing, irritability, depressed mood, or decreased participation in usual physical and/or social activities f. Difficulty eating or loss of appetite g. Weight loss h. Difficulty sleeping (insomnia) i. Negative vocalizations (e.g., yelling, groaning, crying, whimpering, or screaming) j. Decline in activity level k. Skin conditions 1. B. Pain Assessment and Reassessment: 1. LHH will use a pain assessment tool which is appropriate for the resident's/patient's cognitive status, to assist staff in consistent assessment/reassessment of the resident's/patient's pain. a. For residents/patients able to self-report pain intensity, the Verbal Descriptor Scale is the preferred method, however, the staff may use the Numerical Rating Scale when the resident/patient can more easily report their pain File: 25-06 Pain Recognition, Assessment , and Management Revised September 14November 30, 2022, 2021 Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabilitation Center Page 5 of 30 through that method (See Appendix A). b. The LN will utilize the PAINAD to assess possible pain behaviors for cognitively impaired residents/patients who cannot reliably report pain or for residents who do not have verbal function to be able to report pain (e.g., severe receptive or expressive aphasia) (See Appendix B). 2. For non-English speaking residents /patients who read in their native language, use the appropriate translated Laguna Honda Pain Intensity Scales (see Appendix A for English, Spanish and Chinese versions). a. Additional assessment information may require an interpreter to interview the resident. 3. Based on professional standards of practice, an assessment or evaluation of pain by the appropriate member of the interdisciplinary team may necessitate gathering the following information, as applicable to the resident/patient. a. Pain intensity b. Duration of pain c. Frequency d. Location e. Timing f. Pattern (e.g., constant, or intermittent) g. Radiation of pain h. Descriptors (e.g., stabbing, aching, pressure, dull, etc.) i. Impact of pain on quality of life j. The resident's/patient's goals for pain management k. Physical or psychosocial issues that might be causing or exacerbating the pain l. Additional symptoms associated with the pain (e.g., nausea, anxiety) m. Treatment modalities that have been effective in managing the pain in the past 1. LN Role-Frequency of Pain Assessment (SNF/Long-Term Care Areas) 4. Licensed Nursing staff For all Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) admissions, the nurse LN will complete the SNF Nursing Admission Pain Assessment within the Admission Navigator . a. b. As part of the RAI process, the nursing L N N staff screens/ assesses for pain by completing the MDS pain interview for residents able to communicate verbally, and with the following frequency; i. , at On admission ,, ii. Qquarterly, iii. Aannually, iv. and wW ith a condition change in condition . v. For residents unable to self-report pain during the RAI process , staff observation of possible pain -related behaviors areis recordedassessed File: 25-06 Pain Recognition, September 14November 30, 2022, 2021 Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabilitation Center Page 6 of 30 and documented . c. Upon resident readmission d. Prior to administering routine medication ordered to treat pain e. Before and within 1 hour after PRN medication to treat pain f. Anticipatory Pain: The LN will assess the resident/patient for the potential for pain prior to treatments/interventions that may induce discomfort, and administer pharmacologic treatment per physician order prior to such treatments as appropriate (e.g., wound care, rehabilitation therapies, range of motion, etc.). a. For acute units, the nurse will complete the Comprehensive Pain Assessment Form. 5. LN Role-Frequency of Pain Reassessment (SNF/Long-Term Care Areas) a. The LN will reassess and document the pain location and pain intensity within one-hour after each PRN medication to treat pain. b. The LN will reassess the resident's/patient's pain during treatments that might cause discomfort, assessing whether the pharmacologic treatment has been effective, and consult with the RCT when treatment modalities may need modification. 6. LN Role-Frequency of Pain Assessment and Reassessment (Acute Unit) a. Pain Assessment/Reassessment will be completed; At a minimum every shift on Acute Rehab, every 4 hours on Acute Medical, and admission i. Prior to administering routine and prn medication to treat pain The LN will reassess and document the pain location and pain intensity within one-hour after each PRN medication to treat pain. Before and within 1 hour after PRN medication to treat pain ii. When clinically indicated (e.g., if patient exhibits behaviors that may indicate pain, with any change in condition with onset of pain, with treatments/procedures when pain is anticipated to occur, after pain interventions, etc.) iii. For pain documentation in the LHH Acute Unit, refer to the Nursing Policy, Documentation of Care - Acute Unit. 7. CNA/PCA Role in Monitoring Pain a. CNAs/PCAs, under the direction of the LN, may assist to monitor the resident's/patient's self-report of pain intensity (e.g., Verbal Descriptor Scale or Numerical Rating Scale) and possible pain behaviors observed during care, and report these findings to the LN for further pain assessment and management. a.8. Medical Staff Role Medical staff Physicians File: 25-06 Pain Recognition, Assessment , and Management Revised September 14November 30, 2022, 2021 Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabilitation Center Page 7 of 30 a. Perform a complete past medical history and physical examination which includes review of conditions commonly associated with pain .;. i. ii.b. Review medication regimen;regimen. iii. Evaluate past medical history for conditions commonly associated with pain (e.g., arthritis, orthopedic injuries, peripheral vascular disease, advanced cancer, AIDS etc.); and iv.c. Obtain tests to guide diagnosis and treatment of painful conditions as appropriateindicated . d. Determine if the resident /patient has a history of substance use disorder (SUD)and if known, opioid diversion ,. and any considerations that the SUD might have on the resident's/patient's pain management plan. 2. Other Resident Care Team (RCT) Members 9. 1. In addition to the LN and physician , Oother RCT care team members such as the Certified Assistant/Patient Care Assistance (CNA/PCA), sSocial Wworker (SW), Aactivity Ttherapist (AT), dietitian, and rehabilitation therapists and staff may recognize the presence of pain as part of their initial and ongoing assessment process using some of the following strategies: a. v.i. Interviewing the resident 's/patient's or family caregiver;caregiver. vi. Inquiring of family caregivers how they recognize the resident /patient is in pain;. and ii. iii. Observing the resident /patient in recreational or therapeutic activities .;. vii.iv. Observing whether the resident /patient might be experiencing any pain-related behaviors during care and treatment. 2. C. Pain Reassessment a. Monitor pain intensity at a minimum of every shift utilizing the appropriate pain assessment scale for the resident's/patient's functional and cognitive ability. (Verbal Descriptor Scale is preferred) each time vital signs are measured except as noted below. File: 25-06 Pain Recognition, Assessment , and Management Revised September 14November 30, 2022, 2021 Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabilitation Center Page 8 of 30 i. Exceptions: If resident requires frequent V.S. measurement for a procedure (e.g. blood transfusion) or post injury (e.g. post fall with neuro checks), pain is assessed at the beginning and completion of the assessment process. For non-English speaking residents who read in their native language, use the appropriate translated Laguna Honda Pain Intensity Scales (see Appendix A for English, Spanish and Chinese versions). b. Additional assessment information may require an interpreter to interview the resident. c. Reassess and document pain location and pain intensity before as needed (PRN) medications, PRN, and record pain intensity only within theone hour after each PRN medication administered. d. Nursing assistantsCNAs/PCAs may monitor/record the residents' self- reports of pain intensity and report increased pain scores and possible pain behaviors to the licensed nurseLN for further assessment and management. e. For residents able to self-report pain intensity, either the Verbal Descriptor Scale or Numeric Rating Scale, may be used. (Refer to Appendix A.) Use the PAINAD to compute assess possible pain behaviors score for severely cognitively impaired residents who cannot reliably report pain or for residents who do not have verbal function to be able to report pain (e.g., severe receptive or expressive aphasia). (See Appendix B.) Anticipatory Pain The LN will assess the resident for the potential for pain prior to treatment interventions that may induce discomfort, and will administer pharmacologic treatment per physician order prior to such treatments as indicated (e.g., wound care, rehabilitation therapies, mobilization, etc.), The LN will assess during such treatments whether the pharmacologic treatment has been effective to proceed with the treatment. f. If the pharmacologic treatment has not been successful in managing the resident's pain, the LN will cease the treatment until discussing with the physician an alternate or additional pharmacologic therapy. 3. Pain Management 1. Resident-Centered/Patient-Centered pain management Principles of Pain Managementinterventions will be incorporated into the components of the Pain Care Plan, addressing conditions or situations that may be associated with pain, and which may include a specific pain management need or goal. 1. The RCT and resident/patient and/or resident's/patient's representative will collaborate to arrive at a pertinent realistic and measurable goal for pain treatment. File: 25-06 Pain Recognition, Assessment , and Management Revised September 14November 30, 2022, 2021 Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabilitation Center Page 9 of 30 2. i.a. The goals and interventions developed to manage pain are based on: v. The nature of the pain vi. The underlying pathophysiologic mechanism vii. Past interventions used viii. The resident's treatment preferences ix. Available resources x. Side effect profile and tolerance xi. Medical contraindications to specific interventions xii. Functional impact of pain and its treatment ii. A combination of complementary and pharmacological interventions shall be attempted to manage chronic pain. b. iii.c. The RCT develops a Pp ain management Care Plan plan whose goal is to help the resident /patient achieve a level of pain relief tolerable , to him/her while maximizing the resident's /patient's functional ability and quality of life. iv.d. If the resident /patient has pain that is not amenable to routine interventions, pain management consultants, such as the Pain and Healing Center Clinic, may be considered are available to assist the RCT toin managinge the resident's pain. v.e. Risks and benefits of opioid therapy for non-cancer pain will be discussed with the resident /patient and/or surrogate decision - maker. Providers may use the opioid informed consent . (See MSPP D15 XXXX ). vi.f. A treatment agreement may be used to clarify roles and responsibilities of the resident/patient and the care team and consequences for misuse of opioids. (See MSPP D15XXXX .) vii. For recognizing/ treating pain in special populations see Appendices B, C, and D. 2.

Use PAINAD (see below) to detect pain related behaviors and record pain scores in EHR or TAR as per downtime procedures. 2. Rule out other non-pain causes of behaviors and intervene appropriately. 3. If a resident is sometimes able to self-report pain intensity, use self-report rather than PAINAD. 4. For residents with painful chronic conditions, such as arthritis, assume resident has pain and provide around the clock analgesia, (not PRN) before using psychotropics. 5. Maximize the use of complementary therapies (tub baths, massage, movement activities, and distraction) in addition to pharmacological interventions. 6. Carefully evaluate for medication side effects and adverse effects since resident's ability to notice/report these may be compromised.

File: 25-06 Pain September 14November 30, 2022, 2021 Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabilitation Center Page 19 of 30 Appendix C: Guidelines for Managing Pain in Residents with Substance Use Disorders 1. Residents with Pain Who Are Actively Using Non-prescribed substances or alcohol: a. Understand that many patients who use substances do so to feel good or to feel better. Undertreated pain may be a trigger to substance use relapse. b. If patient consents, refer patient to STARS for assessment, treatment, and/or medication-assisted treatment (eg. buprenorphine/methadone/etc.) c. Educate the resident that the goals of pain treatment are to manage pain and improve functioning, while maintaining safety. d. Residents who frequently use opioids (e.g., heroin) often require higher than expected doses because of pre-existing tolerance. e. Dose analgesics on a scheduled or an around-the-clock basis for residents with chronic pain. f. Minimize PRN dosing for chronic, non-acute, non-cancer pain as this may lead to confrontation with staff about when it is time for medication, how much is needed etc. g. Monitor for signs of diversion and develop plan with RCT to address if signs are discovered (this applies to all residents even those without known substance disorder history). h. Recognize that many individuals with substance use disorders have: low pain thresholds, possible atypical pathophysiologic pain mechanisms, and increased anxiety related to the adequacy of pain management because of past negative experiences with the healthcare system and providers. Therefore they may be untrusting of your intentions. i. Maximize use of non-pharmacologic and complementary interventions (e.g., heat/cold; massage; acupuncture; cognitive-behavioral approaches; etc.). j. interactions (e.g., with antiretrovirals, Rifampin-Methadone, benzodiazepines, etc.) that may influence dose of opioid required to control pain and to prevent withdrawal or overdose. k. If opiate medications are being decreased, monitor for signs of withdrawal and provide treatment, as withdrawal may increase the resident's experience of pain and may trigger an increase in substance use. File: 25-06 Pain Recognition, Assessment , and Management Revised September 14November 30, 2022, 2021 Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabilitation Center Page 20 of 30 l. If the resident has acute pain, begin tapering opioids as the underlying condition is healing and counsel resident beforehand regarding this plan. m. In general, believe the resident's complaints of pain unless you have compelling evidence otherwise. Recall that pain is subjective experience without reliable biological markers. n. Closely monitor the interaction between pain management plan and substance use disorders. 2. Residents in Remission/Recovery from Substance Use Disorders a. Recognize that some residents may deny pain or refuse treatment for pain because of fear of relapse. b. Maximize use of non-opioid analgesics and adjuvant agents. c. Educate resident on the risks, benefits and alternatives for opioid pain medications if these medications are indicated. d. Maximize use of non-pharmacologic/complementary interventions (e.g., heat/cold; massage; acupuncture; cognitive-behavioral approaches etc.) e. Closely monitor the effect of the pain management plan on the resident's disease of addiction. f. Residents on daily methadone maintenance (for opioid dependence) may require more frequent dosing, or additional analgesics for pain control. File: 25-06 Pain Recognition, Assessment , and Management Revised September 14November 30, 2022, 2021 Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabilitation Center Page 21 of 30 Appendix D: Guidelines for Recognizing/Managing Pain and Other Sources of Distress in Residents who are Actively Dying 1. When the resident is able to report symptoms: a. Inquire about pain/hurt b. Ask about other uncomfortable symptoms: shortness of breath, anxiety, mental confusion, sadness, regret, nausea etc. 2. When resident is non-verbal, observe for behaviors suggestive of discomfort including but not limited to: moaning, groaning, facial grimacing, tense body language, restlessness, confusion, difficulty breathing, etc. Consider family/friend reports of discomfort. 3. If signs or symptoms are present, conduct a comprehensive assessment to understand: a. Onset of sign/symptom b. Duration (constant, intermittent, related to care procedures, etc.) c. Non-pharmacological interventions (repositioning, calm and reassurance, etc.) used. d. Pharmacological interventions to be used to relieve distress. e. Evaluate effectiveness of the interventions and revise plan as necessary. 4. Assessing/addressing physical symptoms and other sources of suffering provides support and comfort for family, friends and volunteers providing support. 5. For physical symptoms: a. Review current medication regimen for PRN medications. b. If resident is no longer able to swallow medications consult with MD and pharmacist for alternative routes of administrations and formulations, e.g. parenteral (SQ or IV), suppository, concentrated liquid formulation for sublingual administration. c. New medication orders should be obtained STAT to relieve terminal symptoms. d. Evaluate effectiveness of medication in relieving symptoms/behaviors e. For persistent symptoms, scheduled dosing is often necessary rather than PRN. File: 25-06 Pain Recognition, Assessment , and Management Revised September 14November 30, 2022, 2021 Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabilitation Center Page 22 of 30 f. Provide regular oral care to moisten/refresh mouth and lips. 6. For residents being treated for pain orally, who are approaching the end of life, the attending physician may include additional orders with alternate route of administration in advance so there is no delay in obtaining the medication or controlling the symptoms, e.g, If unable to take PO Morphine dose, may give Morphine ___ mg SQ/IV every ___ hours (ATC or PRN) pain/SOB. 7. For evenings, nights, weekends and holidays, when necessary contact on call physician for unrelieved symptoms requiring evaluation/treatment.

Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g. carbapenems, fluoroquinolones) are reserved for situations in which narrower-spec trum drugs are likely to fail. Empiric therapy should continue for no more than 3-4 days to prevent adverse effects and resistance. 2. Combination therapytherapies are used for patients who have multi-drug resistant pathogens. 3. Antibiotics are narrowed based on antibiogram, formulary selection, culture results and sensitivities to minimize drug resistance. 4. Serum antibiotic drug levels are drawn to optimize efficacy and prevent toxicities for some antibiotics, including: vancomycin, aminoglycosides. 5. With improvement of the pat ient's medical condition, IV antibiotics are converted to oral agents to decrease health care costs and length of acute hospital stay. Patients will be discharged back to their pr evious ward with appropriate oral antimicrobials, if needed. 25-13 Herbal Supplements: Formulary and Non-Formulary New November 8, 2022 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 1 of 3 HERBAL SUPPLEMENTS: FORM ULARY AND NON-FORMULARY POLICY: 1.

Mitigation/Preparedness: During cert ain emergency situations, particularly chemical/HAZMAT, biological, radioactive events or weather emergencies, it may be advisable for employees to shelter-in-pl ace rather than evacuate the building. Shelter-in-place is a strategy taken to main tain patient care wit hin LHH and to limit the movement of staff and vi sitors to protect life and property from hazard. Shelter- in-place is an ideal method of self-protect ion from airborne contaminants, such as a toxic airborne chemical or a person wit h a weapon. It may be necessary to evacuate certain parts of LHH and shelter-in-pl ace in another part of the facility. i. Criteria for Implementat ion: In situations posing an immediate threat to the safety of employees and visitors shelter in place procedures must take priority. Shelter in place will be determined by t he Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or the Administrator On Duty (AOD). ii. Pre-Event Information: Potential terrori st incidents, such as the release of a chemical hazard may be preceded by alerts issued by lo cal or state authorities. Information may be disseminated to LHH via PHEPR. Notification may also be made from law enforcemen t, HAZMAT teams or fire department via telephone. iii. Activation of Emergency Response Procedures: Upon notification that a suspected/confirmed airbor ne chemical/biological hazar d is likely to impact LHH the Emergency Response Plan will be activated and \"Shelte r in Place\" will be announced overhead. Notification may be made by Mass Notification system and email. Response Measure Identify nature of incident and determine necessary level of response and protection. Coordinate safet y and securit y with law enforcement entities as appropriate. Implement the following activities: Close air vents, windows, and doors. Facilities department to shut down hospi tal Vacuum and Air Conditioning Unit. (HVAC ) Notify employees, visitors and vendors as to nature of the danger and reason for the shelte r-in-place. Assess capabilities and identify personnel resource requirements and staff availabilit y. Develop and implement public-informati on plans for employees and the media to provide information on disease recogn ition, necessary infection-control measures, treatments, and home-care/afte r-care instructions. File: 70-01 Emergency Preparedness and Response Manual Revised March 17, 2020 B3 Resident Evacuation Plan Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 6 of 11 iv. Reassessment of Event: External co mmunication via, news media, California Health Alert Network (CAHAN) notific ations, ReddiNet, email notification, landline communication may provide addit ional information critical to the assessment and reassessment of the shel ter in place response activities. v. Recovery Strategies: Assess staffi ng requirements and provide an organized reporting structure. Ensure that the HVAC system and ventilator systems have returned to normal operations. Take down signs from all building entrances and exits. Notify employees, patients and v endors of the ability to enter and exit the building. Provide safe reentry pathways to the building in an organized manner. vi. Education & Training New employees at LHH receive emergency preparedness training at new employee orientation. All staff shall receive emergency preparedness training annually with e-learning module. 7. Communication and Coordination a.

Laguna Honda Hospital and Reh abilitation Center shall c onduct a minimum of one Fire Drill per building or zone occupied by residents (e.g. in the North, South and Pavilion buildings) each month on rotating shi fts for a total of 3 drills per month to reach each shift at least quarterly. 2. Fire Drills will be scheduled by the hospital's Fire Safety Officer (FSO), in cooperation with appropriate department man agers, however the drills will be randomly conducted and unannounced to staff prior to the drill. 3. It shall be each department manager's responsibility to understand and comply with Fire Drill procedures, and to require staf f participation in all Fire Drills. 4. Department managers are responsible for a ssuring that their employees receive Fire Safety Training as part of new employee ori entation and annually t hereafter. The Fire Safety Officer (FSO) is available as a re source to provide training as necessary. PURPOSE: Fire drills are conducted regularly so that staff are familiar with Code Red procedures and can readily respond in case of an actual fire in the facility. PROCEDURE: 1. The FSO or designee will prepare a quarterly drill schedul e identifying the locations and times of the drills. This schedule will be submitted to the Executive Administrator and Chief Operations Officer (COO). 2. The FSO will advise the Nursi ng Operations Officer (NOO) of the time and location of the Code Red Drill, will call DTIS (monitoring service) to notify th em that the City Tie will be deactivated during a drill, and will deactivate the City Tie, allowing for drill participants to activate a manual pull statio n without sending an actual alarm to the Fire Department. 3. Upon notification of a Code Red Drill by the FSO or designee , hospital staff are to take the following actions: Follow the R.A.C.E. acr onym below for basic fire response steps: i. Rescue persons in immedi ate danger while announcing \"C ode Red\" to nearby staff. File: 71-12 Fire Drill Revised July 9, Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Proc edures P age 2 of 7 ii.

Staff in areas of the hospital other t han the drill location shall simulate a Code Red Drill in their department. The department supervisor will complete the Fire Drill Participation form, include signatures of st aff, and will forward it to the Fire Safety Officer. For night shift drills, National Fire Protection Administration Life Safety code permits silencing of chimes; staff are al erted to the drill by overhead announcement. 5. The FSO or designee will advise the NOO when the fire drill is concluded. The NOO r will announce \"Code Red Drill Al l Clear\" three times over the public address system and will transmit the same message via radio to all radio units . The FSO may disable the chimes for night shift drills, however , the overhead announcement will still be made. 6. All Department Managers, Nu rse Managers or designees shal l complete the Fire Drill Participation form, and fax it to the Fire Sa fety Officer in Facility Services at 759-2330 within one hour of the drill. The FSO shall notify t he Nurse Manager and Nursing Supervisor of any neighborhoods that fail to submit a Fire Drill Participation Form within an hour of completion of a fire dr ill. The FSO shall submit an Unusual Occurrence to Quality Managem ent if there are any neighbor hoods that have failed to submit a Fire Drill Participat ion Form 24 hours after completi on of a fire drill. The FSO will record departmental/ward participation and report results to Division Heads and to the Safety Committee. The FSO will complete a separate form for the drill location. All forms will be placed on file for annual review by the State Fire Marshal. 7. The FSO will advise the Nursing Office that the Code Red Drill is clear, will call DTIS to notify them that the City Tie is being reactivated, and will reactivate the City Tie.

Laguna Honda Hospital (LHH) will implem ent an ongoing infection prevention and control (IPC) surveillance progr am that provides for a syst ematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of healthcare-related data essential to planning, implementation, and evaluation of the resident care services to identify trends and inform decisions for care in an effort to reduce transmi ssion of disease in this population. 2. An annual risk evaluation that includes IPC trends and findings will provide the baseline to guide care, treatment and services to this population. 3. LHH will utilize McGeerNHSN criteria for long-term care /skilled nursing facilities (SNF) and National Healthcare Safety Network (NHS N) criteria for acute care facilities to define surveillance criteria, identify spec ific data collection methods, as well as determine what qualifies as in an infection to use consistently and accurately. 4. LHH recognizes that surve illance definitions are not the sa me as clinical definitions and that McGeer and NHSN criteria do not define clin ical diagnosis or treatment. Ultimately, only the medical pr ovider will provide the medi cal/clinical diagnosis and treat accordingly. LHH will consistently use McGeer and NHSN criteria for NHSN, local, and state reporti ng requirements. 5. To provide an accurate risk evaluation fo r the LHH population, the annual IPC program risk assessment will include but is not limit ed to the following elements/data: a. Demographics and needs of the resident population b. Infection rates c. Changing pathogens and antimicrobial resistance d. Community health events and emerging infectious disease e. Change in technology, procedur es and standards of practice PURPOSE: The objectives of the progr am include the following: 1. Monitor the occurrence of healthcare -associated infections (HAIs) and develop intervention strategies to reduce such infections; 2. Detect and investigate clusters of HA Is or outbreaks and em erging infectious diseases; File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 2020 A5 Infection Control Surveillance Program Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 2 of 5 3. Evaluate infection prevent ion and control measures; 4. Observe staff compliance with infection control standards and facility policies and procedures; 5. Identify potential risk factors for infection; 6. Gather and compile HAI data, observe trends and patterns, and determine rates of occurrence; 7. Identify organisms of epidemiologic significance such as tuberculosis and antibiotic- resistant bacteria; 8. Utilize surveillance information to conduct communicable disease contact and exposure investigations (e.g. po sitive tuberculosis screens); and 9. Meet mandated city, stat e, and federal reporting require ments based on surveillance data. PROCEDURE: 1. The responsibility of infection control surve illance is carried out by the Infection Control Nurse (ICN). Electronic information may be gathered from, but not limited to, the following sources: a. Microbiology department for culture results b. Pharmacy department for antibiotic orders c. Radiology department fo r chest x-ray results d. Respiratory care departm ent for nasal swab results e. Nursing department change of shift reports f. Resident/patient health records 2. Suspected infections that occur on L HH SNF neighborhoods are reviewed by the ICN based on McGeer criteria to det ermine if the infection is an HAI or community-acquired infection (CAI). 3. Suspected infections that occur on the ac ute care units are revi ewed by the ICN based on NHSN criteria. NHSN repor ting of acute care HAIs and CAIs includes the submission of a monitoring plan and ongoing surveillance of antibiotic resistant organisms as well as annual influenz a vaccination rates for staff. File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 2020 A5 Infection Control Surveillance Program Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 3 of 5 4. Confirmed cases of HAIs and CAIs are listed on the monthly neighborhood infection control surveillance log and are available fo r review by the clinical care team members. 5. Monthly surveillance data is aggregated quar terly and submitted for review by the Infection Control Committee for trends and patterns. 6. Surveillance data on antibioti c resistant organisms such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) species, Carbapenem-resistant organisms, and Clostridioides difficile (C. diff ) are specially tracked for trends, new incidence, recurrence, co lonization, and appropriate treatment. 7. An annual infection control report is prepared based on surveillance data gathered, observation findings, and other infection cont rol activities performed during the past fiscal year. The report is submitted annuall y to the Performanc e Improvement and Patient Safety Committee and to the Joint Conference Committee for their review and evaluation of the facility's infect ion prevention and control program. 8. The ICN conducts quarterly and as needed infection control rounds, which include hand hygiene, specialized precautions, and general infection prevention and control standards wherever resident care activities are carried out and in food preparation areas. 9. Findings from infection rounds are s hared with the manager of the respective department for follow-up as necessary. 10. Based on infection control surveillance data gathered, the ICN is responsible for submitting and or preparing the following reports: a. Monthly NHSN reporting for infecti ons occurring on the acute care units. a. Cases of reportable Definitions: \"Infection surveillance\" refers to an ongoing systematic collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of infection-related data. \"Outcome measure\" is a mechanism for evaluating ou tcomes or results, such as tracking specific infection events. \"Process measure\" is a mechanism for evaluating s pecific steps in a process that lead, either positively or negatively, to a particular outcome metric. Also known as performance monitoring, a process measure is used to evaluate whether infection prevention and control practices are being followed. File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 2020 A5 Infection Control Surveillance Program Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 4 of 5 Policy Explanation and Compliance Guidelines: 1. The Infection Preventionist serves as t he leader in surveillance activities, maintains documentation of incidents, findings, and any corrective actions made by the facility and reports surveillance findings to the fa cility's Quality Assessment and Assurance Committee, and public health aut horities when required. 2. The staff participate in surveillance through assessment of residents and reporting changes in condition to the resident's ph ysicians and management staff, per protocol for notification of changes and in-house r eporting of communic able diseases and infections. Examples of notification triggers include, but are not limited to: a. Resident develops signs and symptoms of infection. b. A resident is started on an antibiotic. c. A microbiology test is ordered. d. A resident is placed on isolation pr ecautions, whether empirically or by physician order. e. Microbiology test results show drug resistance. 3. An annual infection control risk assessment will be used to prioritize surveillance efforts, as documented in the facility's Infection Surveillance Action Plan . In turn, surveillance data will provide information for subsequent infection control risk assessments. 4. The CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Long Term Care Criteria will be used to define infections. For MDS purposes, specific guidance in the RAI manual will be followed when codi ng for infections (i.e. UTI). 5. Surveillance activities will be monitor ed facility-wide, and may be broken down by department or unit, depending on the measure being observ ed. A combination of process and outcome meas ures will be utilized. b.6. The facility will collect dat a to properly identify possible communicable diseases to the local health department . or infections before they spread by identifying: c. Outbreaks to the loca l and state health departments. a. Data to be collected, including how o ften and the type of data to be documented, including: i. The infection site, pathogen (if ava ilable), signs and symptoms, and resident location, including summary and analysis of the number of resi dents (and staff, if applicable) who developed infections: ii. Observations of staff including the ident ification of ineffective practices, if any; and iii. The identification of unusual or unex pected outcomes, infection trends and patterns. b. How the data will be used and shared and with appropriate individuals (e.g., staff, medical director, director of nursing, QAA committee) when applicable, to ensure that staff minimize spread of the infection or disease. File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 2020 A5 Infection Control Surveillance Program Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 5 of 5 7. The facility will communicate via email co mmunications, the Daily Situational Stat (DSS report) and clinical huddles to staff and/ or prescribing practitioners information related to infection rates and outcomes in order to revise interventions/approaches and/or re-evaluate medical interventions as indicated. 8. Monthly time periods will be used for capturing and reporting dat a. Line charts will be used to show data comparisons over time and will be monitored for trends. 9. All resident infections will be tracked. Separate, site-specific measures may be tracked as prioritized from the infecti on control risk assessment. Outbreaks will be investigated. 10. Employee, volunteer, and contract em ployee infections will be tracked, as appropriate and as known, such as influenza or gastrointestinal in fection outbreaks. 11. Data to be used in the surveillance activi ties may include, but are not limited to: a. 24-hour shift reports b. Lab reports c. Antibiograms obtained from lab d. Antibiotic use reports from pharmacy e. Medication regimen review reports f. Skills validations for hand hygiene, PPE, and/or high risk procedures g. Rounding observation data h. Self-reported concerns i. Resident and employee immunization data j. Documentation of signs and symptoms in clinical record k. Transfer/discharge summaries for new or readmitted resident s for infections. 12. Formulas used in calculating infection ra tes will remain constant for a minimum of one calendar year, and will require discussion in QAA meetings before changes in the formulas are made.

Washington DC, WA: APIC Association for Professionals in Infection B5 Transmission-Based Precautions Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 1 of 30 TRANSMISSION-BASED PRECAUTIONS INCLUDING AND RESIDENT ROOM PLACEMENT POLICY: The LHH procedures for facility uses a coordinated process of standard and transmission - based precautions (TBP) will align with the Centers fo r Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) guidance for patient care and safe room placement based on five (5) criteria: 1. appropriate room placement 2. appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) 3. limiting the movement/t ransport for those in TBP 4. use of dedicated pati ent-care equipment and 5. proper cleaning and disi nfection of rooms. 1. Resident room placement will meet the resident care in fection prevention and control needs by providing the most appropriate room and bed assignment for the resident, as determined by the physician in collabo ration with the resident care team and infection prevention and control. 2. Most diagnoses allow placement of resident s into shared rooms and priority for single room placement will be based upon needs, includ ing infection prevention and control requirements for to reduce the risk of transmission -based precautions. 3. Residents with of communicable diseases , whether suspect or confirmed, will be assigned rooms according to the resident care precautions adopted by Laguna Honda Hospital (LHH) and Diseases/Conditions Required Precautio ns to patients, employees, and visitors . 4. Daily cleaning and disinfecting of r ooms with residents in transmission-based precautions will be in effect until the precautions are disc ontinued or until the resident is discharged. This includes enhanced cleaning processes for high-touch areas, horizontal surfaces, and use of specif ic cleaning products , if required. PURPOSE: The purpose of this policy is to provide effect ive practice measures to staff to safely care for patients with RESPONSIBILITES: File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 2022 B5 Transmission-Based Precautions Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 2 of 30 A. This policy applies to all employees of Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabilitation and to all medical staff, volunteers, contract workers and students. B. Supervisors, managers, and directors are required to enforce the provisions of this policy in their areas. Employees who do not follow the contents of this plan may be subject to disciplinary action. C. The Infection Prevention Department is available to provide consultation regarding transmission based precautions. Any patient known or suspected infections that represent an increased risk to others. These measures usually temporary, serve to c ontrol and/or mitigate ri sk to staff, visitors and other patients based upon the indi viduals specific care needs. DEFINITIONS: Transmission-based precautions: Standard Precautions is cons idered the first tier of preventing infections from occurring or being transmitted to others and includes such practices as hand hygiene and respiratory hy giene. Transmission- based Precautions (TBP) is regarded as the second tier of pr ecautions once an infection is known or suspected to be present. The aim of TBP is to slow or stop the spread of that infection to others by using specific measures know n to be effective based upon the mechanisms ofhave a disease or condition that warrants transmission of the specific organism(s). The CDC recognizes three (3) classifications of based precautions will be placed in the appropriate transmission for all disease-causing organisms with specific actions to utilize to reduce transmission. The th ree TBP categories are: 1. Contact 2. Droplet 3. Airborne (respiratory) D. Enhanced Barrier Precautions (EBP) is not a precautions upon admission. Physicians and/or nurses will prom ptly order the precautions category of TBP but an additional intervention for use in skilled nursing homes where there is common colonization of multi-drug resist ant organisms (MDROs) in a residential setting. EBP is a targeted aim of gowns and gloves where MDRO s are present or likely to be present including wounds, indw elling urinary or IV catheters. EBP's may be used alone or in conjunction with other TBPs. EBP require signage, point of care PPE availability, and are usually in effect for the duration of the stay. Standard Precautions will be observed wit h each resident interaction. EBP precautions are found at the end of this documentfor newly diagnosed or suspected cases . It is important to keep in mind that a per son may be infected with one or more organisms simultaneously and may require a combination of controls to reduce transmission. For example, combining influenza (dropl et) and a wound infection (contact). File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 2022 B5 Transmission-Based Precautions Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 3 of 30 Transmission-based precautions does not require the use of disposable food trays or utensils. Routine dietary cleaning procedures are effective at cleaning and disinfecting food utensils for re-use. Colonization: disease causing organisms found on the body but there is no evidence that the organism is causing an infection 1. The nurse is responsible for ensuri ng that the precauti ons are initiated and maintained according to the specified protocol. 2. The infection prevention staff or the patient's nurse may initiate transmission based precautions without the physician's order based upon a lab report, or patient's changing stat us (e.g., diarrhea) or based on a prior known admission infectious status . In those instances, the physician will be notified that t he patient was placed on transmission based precautions, and a note for the rational e will be entered in the nurse's notes. E. PPE will be located in each Resi dent unit and care location/department. PROCEDURE: 1. As an immediate interventi on, whenever a patient is sus pected of having an active infection based upon signs and/or symptoms, it is important not to delay taking measures to institute transmission-bas ed precautions including on holidays, weekends or afterhours, even be fore lab confirmation is available. Delay can result in transmission and illness to others. TBP can be terminated if not warranted based on lab or other confirmation when available. 2. Nursing staff will contact the physician if av ailable or Infection control nurse (ICN) for consideration whether the infection may represent Contact, Dr oplet or Airborne transmission and take immediate appropriate actions including but not limited to: a. Close privacy curtain to reduce air movement if sneezing, coughing b. Communicate with patient and family wh y the steps are necessary to prevent others from becoming infected. c. Move patient a to private room, if available (ask patient to wear mask during transfer if respiratory) d. Provide tissues and disposal bag s for expectorant as appropriate e. Provide isolation cart with PPE in cluding patient specific equipment File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 2022 B5 Transmission-Based Precautions Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 4 of 30 f. Place signage identifying the type of isolation and required PPE for patient care g. Have patient remain in room until lab confirmation has been made including meals and activities h. Nursing staff will confer with the physician for lab confirmation orders i. Cover any drainage from wounds or openings with absorbable dressings j. Follow intravenous protocols for decannula tion of IV's catheters if suspected peripheral line infection or sepsis (may be required to retain catheter tips for culture) k. Restrict entrance of staff and ot her personnel in the room until lab confirmation is made l. Visitation can resume after TBP measur es are in place and visitors are able and willing to adhere to t he precautions based upon their own risk and ability to comply with precaution measures (e.g. masking) m. The resident's electronic health reco rd must contain the rationale for the selected transmission-based precautions. This should also be document in the care plan. n. Once the resident is no longer at-risk for transm itting the infection, the removal of transmission-based precautions is required in order to provide the highest level of emotional well-being, support residents rights and to avoid unnecessary involuntary seclusion. T he physician in collaboration with ICN and accepted best practices will determine when TBP may be terminated. 3. Upon admission or relocation, t he physician and clinical staff will: a. Identify residents who may require tr ansmission-based precautions prior to admission or relocation b. When a patient under a TBP is tr ansported, the facility will provide communication to the receiving instit ution of the TBP type including emergency response, transport vehicles , dialysis or other clinics, and receiving acute care facility/other. c. Pre-Admitting/pre-screeni ng staff will be alerted to residents who may require transmission-based precautions prior to transport in collaboration with the Infection Control Nurse and Patient Fl ow Nurse Manager prior to admission to the facility. File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 2022 B5 Transmission-Based Precautions Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 5 of 30 4. To the extent possible, notification of the resident and responsible party will be made prior to admission or shortly thereafter for the potential of transmission-based precaution requirement s based upon diagnosis. 5. The physician order for tr ansmission-based precautions will be followed by placing the appropriate signage on the door to al ert staff and visitors of proper precautions to take when entering the room. No re ference is to be made r egarding the site or the illness/microorganism. Signage is to indica te the type of TBP only and the required PPE. Signage is available inside the isolat ion carts and on the LHH SharePoint page. 6. Order the appropriate isolation cart from Central Processing Department (CPD) and ensure that the cart remains stocked with appr opriate PPE available to all staff for the entire period of the transmi ssion-based precautions. Re fer to LHHPP 72-01 B25 Isolation Carts. 7. Provide visitors with appropriate PPE and as sist visitors to follow precautions 8. Airborne Precautions are to prevent t he transmission of suspected or confirmed organisms that are tran smitted by the inhalation of infe ctious particles that remain suspended in air for long periods of time, such as measle s, chickenpox, disseminated herpes zoster or active pulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis a. ROOM PLACEMENT: An airborne infect ion isolation room (AIIR), sometimes referred to a negative-pressure room, is required for Airborne Precautions. If an AIIR room is not immediately availabl e, place the patient in a private room, close the door, limit susceptible staf f inside the room (immunocompromised), cover any infectious skin lesions, and transfer to a facility with AIIR availability. b. Cohorting in a centralized location or neighborhood of multiple residents with the same organism may be utilized for some disease processes/illness in alignment with local, stat e and federal guidelines (C ovid-19 for example). c. For transport: the patient should w ear an isolation mask, observe cough etiquette and hand hygiene. Do not allow the patient to remain in a hallway or other waiting area. Transpor t out of the room when the receiving vehicle is ready to receive them. d. STAFF PPE: A fit-tested respirator (e.g. N95) is worn by staff providing care in addition to PPE required for Standard Pr ecautions, such as eye protection. Fit testing is requir ed annually and as needed. e. MEDICAL EQUIPMENT: Use disposable or de dicated patient-care equipment (e.g., blood pressure cuff s) to avoid excessive movement in/out of room. If comm on use of equipment for multiple patients is unavoidable, clean and disinfect such equipment before use on another patient. File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 2022 B5 Transmission-Based Precautions Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 6 of 30 f. CLEANING / DISINFECTING: Clean using the facility schedule using EPA approved disinfectant for specific organism 9. Droplet Precautions are to prevent the transmission of suspected or confirmed organisms that are transmi tted by droplets generated by coughing and sneezing that are too large to become suspended and travel in air and inhaled, but may be deposited on mucous membranes such as rhinovirus or influenza. The Sars CoV-2 virus (Covid- 19) is transmitted primarily by droplet but additional precautions may be required including use of N95 respirator when communi ty transmission is high or there is an outbreak. See the Covid-19 managem ent protocol for specific details for management of Covid-19 infections. a. ROOM PLACEMENT: decisions r egarding patient placement is made on a case-by-case basis considering infecti on risks to other patients in the room and available alternatives. i. The door should remain closed as l ong as it does not represent a safety concern for the patient (i.e., frequent falls) ii. The patient should remain in the room, leaving for only medically necessary purposes. The patient should don a mask when leaving the room, and follow hand hygiene and respiratory hygiene b. STAFF PPE: don a mask upon entry to the room. If expected to go within 6 feet of patient, don a gown in ad dition to a mask at room entry. c. MEDICAL EQUIPMENT: Use disposable or de dicated patient-care equipment (e.g., blood pressure cu ffs) to avoid excessive movement in/out of room. If comm on use of equipment for multiple patients is unavoidable, clean and disinfect such equipment before use on another patient d. CLEANING/DISINFECTING: Clean us ing the facility schedule using EPA approved disinfectant for specific organism 10. Contact Precautions are to prevent the transmission of suspected or confirmed organisms that are transmitted by direct or indirect c ontact with the resident or environment such as uncontainable drainage from a multi-drug resistance organism (MDRO) like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). a. ROOM PLACEMENT: is based upon a cl inical and IP review for risk of transmitting the disease to others. Consi deration is given to type of infection, drainage, cooperation of pati ent to comply with restrictions, patient mobility and activity level, severity of illness as well as the morbidities (immunocompromised for example) of pot ential roommates.

Care plan the room needs, expected duration and provide inst ruction by communicating with patient and family. Consideration must be given to whet her a private bathroom is also needed. b. STAFF PPE: An isolation gown and gloves are worn by staff in addition to PPE required for Standard Precauti ons, such as eye protection. c. MEDICAL EQUIPMENT: Use dispos able or dedicated patient-care equipment (e.g., blood pressure cuffs). If common use of equipment for multiple patients is unav oidable, clean and disinfec t such equipment before use on another patients d. CLEANING/ DISINFECTION: Prioritize cleaning a nd disinfection of the rooms of patients on contact precautions ensuring rooms are frequently cleaned and disinfected (e.g., at least da ily or prior to use by another patient if outpatient setting) focusing on frequently-touched surfaces and equipment in the immediate vici nity of the patient. 11. Enhanced Barrier Precautions (EBP) is an infection control intervention and not a separate category of TBPs, used for pat ients with multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs) in skilled nursing facilities (SNF s) due to the high pr evalence of MDRO colonization which is common in this setting. a. The CDC has expanded EBP for any SN F resident with an indwelling device or wound regardless of MDRO colo nization or infection status b. In the majority of situations, EBP wi ll be in effect for the duration of the patient's admission; door signage shoul d be posted with PPE located at the point of care; care plan EBP for individualized care needs c. EBP is an intervention designed to reduc e transmission of resistant organism that employees the use of targeted gl ove and gown use during high contact resident care activities d. EBP may be indicated when Contact Pr ecautions do not apply, for resident with any of the following regardles s of MDRO colonization status: i. Wounds ii. Indwelling devices (urinary cat heters, IV's, feeding tubes etc.) iii. Infection or colonization with an MDRO e. ROOM PLACEMENT: is based upon a clinical and IP review for risk of transmitting the disease to others. Consi deration is given to type of infection, File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 2022 B5 Transmission-Based Precautions Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 8 of 30 drainage, cooperation of pati ent to comply with restrictions, patient mobility and activity level, severity of illness as well as the morbidities (immunocompromised for example) of pot ential roommates. Ideally, a private room is preferred but not required. Care plan the room needs, expected duration and provide inst ruction by communicating with patient and family. Consideration must be given to whet her a private bathroom is also needed. f. STAFF PPE: An isolation gown and glov es are worn by staff for high contact activities (e.g. bathing, toileting, c hanging incontinence pads or devices) g. MEDICAL EQUIPEMENT: Use disposable or dedicated patient-care equipment (e.g., blood pressure cu ffs). If common use of equipment for multiple patients is unavoidable, clean and disinfect such equipment before use on another patient h. CLEANING/ DISINFECTION: Cleaning and disinfection of the resident's environment will be accomplished using an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved disinfectant that is effective against spore forming organisms or the specific confirmed organism . TRANSMISSION Based Precautions are designed for patients documented or suspected to be infected/ colonized with hi ghly transmissible or epidemiologically important pathogens for which additional precautions bey ond Standard Precautions are needed to interrupt transmission. The th ree categories of Transmission Based Precautions include: Contact, Droplet, and Airborne. A. Signs. Signs will be placed either on the outer room doors for patients placed on transmission based precautions. The sign shall be limited to the type of precautions. B. Patient Transport. If a patient placed on tran smission precautions requires transport, notify the area prior to tr ansport about the patient's condition and the requirement for trans mission based precautions. C. Room Selection. Patients placed under transmi ssion based precautions will be placed in a private room if possi ble or cohorted with another patient infected with the same pathogen. If this is not possible, the patient may be placed with a patient who has low ri sk of infection. Consult Infection Prevention Department. place the tray on a clean barrier instead of on a contaminated environ mental surface. D. Linen. All soiled linen will be handled in the same manner regardless of the patient's specific diagnosis. Although the risk of disease transmission from soiled linen is minimal, the following in fection prevention guidelines apply to the management of linen and laundry. 1. Handle soiled linen as little as po ssible and with a minimum of agitation to prevent gross microbial contam ination of the air and of persons handling the linen. File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 2022 B5 Transmission-Based Precautions Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 9 of 30 2. Linen will not be sorted or ri nsed in patient care areas. 3. Place all linen in the designated leak-proof, laundry bags. It is not necessary to put any linen in a red bag. 4. Caution must be exercised to help prevent laundry bags from being OVERFILLED. Do not drag the linen bag on the floor while transporting to soiled utility room. 5. Filled linen bags will be closed securely. 6. Linen should not be stockpiled in rooms. 7. Double bagging will be utilized only when the original linen bag is torn, punctured, or visibly contaminated on t he outside; or if the linen contains such a large amount of fluid t hat the original bag may leak. E. Foodservice. Disposable trays and utensils for foodservi ce are not necessary for patients under transmission based pr ecautions. Dietary cart s are cleaned per hospital-approved policy. F. Visitors Airborne : Visitation should be limited to only those who Nursing agrees will support patient's safety/wellbeing. Visitors should wear a tight fitting mask (N95 - perform seal c heck) if visitor is unable to tolerate a surg ical mask can be used (Sfeir, 2018). Droplet: Visitation should be limited to only those who Nursing agrees will support patient's safety/well -being. Visito rs wear a surgical mask. Visitors are reminded to keep their hands off of their face and perform hand hygiene upon leav ing the room. Enhanced Droplet : Visitation should be limited to only those who Nursing agrees will support patient's safety/well - being. Visitors wear a tight-fitting mask. Contact : Visitors are not required to wear PPE for contact precautions unless the visitor is going to participat e in direct resident care or visit another patient in the hospital. An information sheet is available to educate families of patients on contac t precautions to determine if the visitor is at risk for in fection (e.g., visitor has an open wound, catheter, etc.). G. Terminal Room Cleaning 1. When patients are dischar ged or transferred, the precaution sign must stay in place u n t i l the designated employee has cleaned the room. 2. All room surfaces and equipment ar e terminally cleaned according to Environmental Services cleaning procedures. Privacy curtains are removed and sent to the laundry. H. Education . The nurse will educate the patient and/or visitors about hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene (if applic able) and the type of transmission precautions. File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 2022 B5 Transmission-Based Precautions Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 10 of 30 I. Environmental Services. EPIC notification automat ically populates on the EVS bed board patients on transmission ba sed precautions. EVS staff shall follow TBP signage posted out side rooms and seek gui dance from nursing for any question. CATEGORIES OF PRECAUTIONS AIRBORNE Precautions are designed to reduce the ri sk or eliminate the airborne transmission of infectious agent s. Airborne transmission o ccurs by dissemination of either airborne droplet nuclei (small particl e residue - 5um or smaller sized evaporated droplets which remain suspended in the air of long periods of time ) or dust particles containing the infectious agent. All patients who are: a) diagnosed with confirmed active TB and are in fectious, or b) under clinical suspicion of active pulmonary TB or who show signs or symptoms indicative of a possible TB infection should be placed in ai rborne precautions (i.e., negative pressure, private room with the door kept closed, N-95 particulate respirator for those entering the room). Patients who have signs and symptoms compat ible with tuberculosis, and who have a diagnostic test for TB (i.e., AFB sputum smear or culture shall be placed under airborne precautions until TB has been ruled out as a diagnosis). A. Patients will be placed in an airborne infections transmission (negative pressure) room with a minimum of 6 - 12 air exchanges per hour with ventilation either outside or through a high efficiency particulate air filter. B. When a patient is placed in an Airborne Precaution room, Plant Facilities must be notified, as thes e rooms must be tested daily using a physical test. Nursing will notify on-ca ll engineer upon admission or transfer of a patient requiring air negative pressure. If the patient is currently in a room that is air negative pressure and then the patient's status changes to need air negative pressure, the nurse needs to notify on- call engineer to check the room for correct pressure daily. C. Patients diagnosed with tuberculosis or rule out tuberculosis will be placed in the following respirat ory isolation rooms: Location Room (s) South 4 28, 48 South 5 28, 48 South 6 28, 48 Pavilion Mezzanine 48 D. Doors must remain closed for the air borne negative pressure rooms to work. This includes doors to ante rooms. File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 2022 B5 Transmission-Based Precautions Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 11 of 30 E. An N-95 particulate respirator must be worn when entering the room of a patient in Airborne Precautions. Personnel will have a qualitative fit test prior to being assigned duties requiring the us e of an N-95 particulate respirator and will perform a fit check (put mask on and make sure that no air escapes while exhaling) prior to each use. NO TE: Gloves and gowns are not required for airborne precautions unless st andard precautions require them. F. Susceptible persons will not enter the r oom of patients known or suspected to have measles (rubeola) or varicella (c hickenpox). Employees who do not know their status may contact th e Employee Health Department. G. Only transport the patient to other areas if it is essential. If transport is necessary, schedule a time slot to avoid other patients (e.g., last patient of the day) if possible and not ify the area regarding patient 's precautions prior to patient transport. H. Patient will wear a surgical or proc edural mask during transport and any time he/she is out of the airbor ne negative pressure room. DROPLET Precautions are designed to reduce the risk of droplet transmission of infectious agents. Droplet transmission invo lves contact of the conjunctivae or the mucous membranes of the nose or mouth of a susceptible person with large particle droplets (larger than 5 um in size) containing microorgani sms generated from a person who has a clinical disease or who is a carrier of the micr oorganism. Droplets are generated by the source person during coughing, sneezing, or talking and/or during the performance of certain procedures such as suctioning and bronchoscopy. Transmission via large particle droplets requires close contact between source and recipient persons, because droplets do not remain suspended in the air and generally travel only short distances, usually 6 feet or less. A. A surgical or procedural mask must be worn when working within a 6 foot diameter of the patient. The healthcare worker may choose to put on the mask prior to entering the room. An airborne transmi ssion negative pressure room is unnecessary. NOTE: Gloves and gowns are not required for droplet precautions unless standard pr ecautions require them. B. Patients will be transported only when m edically necessary. Inform the receiving area that the pati ent is under droplet precaut ions. Patient will wear a surgical mask during transport. ENHANCED DROPLET Precautions are used when patients with suspected novel pathogens (such as COVID-19) are placed in rooms th at are not AIIRs. Patients in Enhanced Droplet precautions require: A. Private room if available File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 2022 B5 Transmission-Based Precautions Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 12 of 30 B. A portable HEPA filter unit may be added to the room. C. Care providers must wear a fit-tested N-95 respirator , and ( PAPR ), gown and gloves. D. Patients should stay in their room exc ept for essential purposes, in which case, a regular mask (surgical) is worn by the patient at all times outside their room. E. Visitors will be instructed to wear a tight fitting mask (if N-95 mask, no fit testing required for visitors). They should be instructed on how to don the mask and how to form a good seal. (See Appendix B: Donning and Doffing Mask) F. Discontinuing Precautions: 1. Enhanced Droplet precautions for COVID-19 positive patients may be discontinued following current CDC and regulatory guidance. Consultation with in fection control is encouraged if questions arise. CONTACT Precautions are designed to reduce the ri sk of transmission of epidemiologically important microorganisms by dire ct or indirect contact. Direct contact transmission involves skin-to-skin contact and ph ysical transfer of mi croorganisms to a susceptible host from an infect ed or colonized person, such as occurs when personnel turn patients, bathe patients, or perform other patient care acti vities that require physical contact. Indirect contact transmission involves contact of a susceptible host with a contaminated intermediate object, usually inanimate, in the patient's environment. Contact precautions are issued for pat ients infected or colonized with: A. Gloves will be worn when having contact with patient care equipment that has been used by a patient on contact precaut ions (e.g., cleaning a wheelchair). B. Staff will wear a clean, non-sterile gown when entering the patient room for any reason. The HALLWAY PPE cart will remain stocked; nursing personnel caring for the patient shall ensure that items on the cart remain stocked including Regular and XL sized gowns. C. ANY reusable patient equipment must be cleaned after use with hospital approved disinfectant products. D. Linen will be stored in a regular linen bag. When the bag is filled, the bag will be closed securely and put in the soiled utility room. E. Solid waste generated by isolation procedur es (e.g., gowns and gloves) shall be disposed of in a regular wast e bag inside the patient's room. File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 2022 B5 Transmission-Based Precautions Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 13 of 30 F. Immediately prior to exiting the pat ient room, PPE will be removed. Gowns will be taken off prior to gloves, rolling inwards. Gloves will be taken off taking care to avoid contamination of t he hands. At that time, hands will be immediately washed with soap and water, or an alcohol antiseptic gel will be used. Avoid recontamination of hands from environmental surfaces. G. Transport of patients under contact precaut ions requires that the patient must be wearing a fresh contact transmission gown outside of th e patients' room. The accepting department will implement contact precautions according to policy when the patient arrives in their department. H. Patients under contact precautions will be allowed outside of the room at the discretion of the unit supervisor. Acc eptable behavior might include walks in the hallway of their unit for exercise. ENHANCED CONTACT Precautions are designed to reduce t he risk of transmission of C.difficile by direct or indirect contac t spread throughout the healthcare environment. Enhanced contact precautions are issued for pat ients with active infectious colitis not colonization. A. Private room if available. B. Follow and adhere to PPE usage as outlined under contact precautions. C. Perform hand hygiene preferably wit h soap and water. Alcohol based hand rubs are an alternative substitute when hand washing sinks are not in close proximity to patient care locations. D. Use hospital-approved sporicidal (bleach) disinfecting wipes on surfaces and equipment. E. Patients should stay in their room except for essential purposes, in which case, patient should be conti nent and ability to contain liquid stool is possible. Patient shall wash hands with soap and water and place a clean gown prior to leaving room. ENHANCED BARRIER Precautions- Long Term Care for residents with wounds or indwelling medical devices during specific high-contact resident care activities commonly associated with MDRO transmission. A. Private room if available or cohor t with compatible roommate based on MDRO status. B. Wear gowns and gloves while performing high-risk tasks: 1. Morning and evening care 2. Device care (Urinary, Feeding tube, etc.) File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 2022 B5 Transmission-Based Precautions Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 14 of 30 3. Close contact resident care (Bat hing, peri-care, toileting, changing briefs, respiratory care). 4. Changing bed linens C. In multi bedrooms, consider each bed space as a separate room and change gowns, gloves and perform hand hygiene when moving from contact with on resident to contact with another resident. D. Gowns and Gloves should always be removed inside the room when care activity is complete. Go wns and Gloves should not be worn outside the room when resident ca re is not being performed. E. Visitors do not need to routinely wear gown and gloves when visiting a resident on EBP. However, visitors who participate in close resident care activity, should wear gowns and gloves when providing care. DISCONTINUATION of TRANSMI SSION BASED PRECAUTIONS: Transmission based precautions remain in effect for a limit ed periods (while risk of transmission of infectious agent persists during the period of infectivity). A. Empirically initiated transmission bas ed precautions may be adjusted or discontinued when additi onal clinical informati on becomes available (confirmatory laboratory results). B. Strategies for determining when to di scontinue precautions are organism specific and summarized in Appendix A ATTACHMENT: Attachment 1: Standard Work for Disposable Isolation Meal Trays Appendix A: Type and Duration of Transmission Based Precautions Recommended for Selected Infections and Conditions Appendix B: Donning and Doffing Mask REFERENCE: LHHPP 20-01 Admission LHH Acute Services Relocation Between SNF Units LHHPP 72-01 B1 F13 Cleaning infecting Non-Critical Re sident Care Equipment File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual October 13, 2022 B5 Transmission-Based Precautions Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies 15 of 30 LHHPP 73-07 Aerosol Transmissibl e Disease Exposure Control Plan LHHPP 73-09 Respiratory Pr otection Program (RPP) CDC 2007 Guideline for Isolation Precaut ions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings , retrieved October 1, 2015 (2007) CMS State Operations M anual (2017, November 22).

Visitors shall be provided with infection prevention and control instructions and or written materials by Nursing staff or other disciplines when visiting residents. 1. This facility will implement heightened surv eillance activities for communicable disease during periods of transmission in t he community, an outbreak in the facility, and/or during a declar ed public health emergency for t he illness. The facility may modify visitation practices when there are infectious outbreaks or pandemics to align with current CMS guidance and CDC guidelines . Visitors will be expected to follow general infection control practices to prot ect a vulnerable population when visiting the facility. Visitation will be permitted at all ti mes with very limited exceptions to ensure that resident's rights are respected and prioritized. PURPOSE: To The purpose of this policy is to provide information to minimize the transmission risk of infection from the community to the patients by using general control measures including hand hygiene, resp iratory hygiene, vaccinations and masking to reduce the risk of disease transmission. When in the facility, visitors to residents or staff and to assist staff in educating visitors onare expect ed to adhere to the core principles of infection prevention and control recommendations to reduce transmission of infections.follow the local, state, and federal requi rements when outbreaks occur. DEFINITION: Visitor : AnyoneFor the purpose of this poli cy a visitor is defined as anyone who is not a healthcare worker,performing work in the facility at the request of the facility, whether paid or unpaid ; who comes on the Laguna Honda Hospital (LHH) campus to meet, visit, or co mes within 6 feet of a resident . PROCEDURE: 1. VisitorsVisitors that are Ill: Signage will be posted at entrances that indicate that visitors with a fever, respiratory, or gastrointes tinal symptoms shall be asked to refrain from visiting LHH until they are afebrile for at least 24 hour s (without the use of fever- reducing medication) and symptoms have resolved for at least 24 hours. 2.

Only materials essential for preparing the st erile product should be placed in t he primary engineering control. Products must be adequately separated so as not to disrupt the unidirec tional airflow leaving the high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. Overcrowding of mate rials should be avoided also to minimize disruption of clean airflow. 11. Extreme care must be taken to pr event obstruction of clean air acro ss the critical area or site, defined as the area immediate to the point of entry area in to a container, including the needle or device used to enter the container. The pharmacist or technician must be aware about the relation of other objects within the cabinet so that these objects never become an obstacle between the HEPA filter and critical area, as th is can cause contamination of t he critical area. Avoid reaching directly over the critical ar ea because contaminants from the per son or clothing may fall on the critical area. Only the cleanest air should be allowed to flow over the critical area of all the materials within the hood. 12. Avoid touch contaminat ion of sterile needles, syringe par ts, and other cr itical sites. 13. Solutions from ampoules must be prop erly filtered to remove particles. 14. Solutions from reconstituted powders should be mi xed carefully, ensuring complete dissolution of the drug with the appropriate diluents. 15. Needle entry into vials should be performed at a 45-60\u00b0 angle with the beveled side facing upwards to avoid coring of the vial closure. 16. After completion of the prod uct, an additive cap or seal should be placed over the stopper or additive portal, to signify completion of the product as well as protect the portal from contamination. 17. Before, during and af ter the preparation of ster ile products, the pharmacist or technician sh ould carefully check the identity and verify t he amounts and sequence of the additives in the sterile preparations detailed in the master dr ug formula against the original prescr iption, medication order, or other appropriate document ation before the product is released or dispensed. 07.01.00 Sterile Product Preparation, Handling, and Disposal Revised September July 20202022 _____________________________________________________________________________________ Laguna Honda Hospital Pharmacy Department Policy Page 12 of 17 18.

PURPOSE: To limit exposure of pharma cy personnel and the enviro nment to hazardous drugs DEFINITIONS: Hazardous Drug (HD) : Any drug which poses significant risk to a healthcare worker by virtue of its teratogenic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, reproductive toxicity potential, or which can cause serious organ or other toxic manifestation at low doses. Drug classes listed as HD include: cytotoxic/chemotherapy agents, hormonal agents, immunosuppressants, some antiviral agents, some anti biotics and some biological response modifiers. Cytotoxic Drug : A type of hazardous drug that destroys cells or inhibits or prevents their function. Cytotoxic drugs include drugs used for cancer (chemotherapy) and in some cases those drugs are used to treat other conditions (e.g., psoriasis, arthritis, transplant rejection). No t all drugs used to treat cancer are cytotoxic. Chemotherapy glove: A medical glove that meets the ASTM Standard Practice for Assessment of Resistance of Medical Gloves to Permeation by Chemotherapy Drugs (D6978) or its successor. Containment primary engi neering control (C-PEC): A ventilated device designed and operated to minimize worker and environmental exposures to HDs by controlling emissions of airborne contaminants through the following: 1. The full or partial enclosure of a potential contaminant source 2. The use of airflow capture velocities to trap and remove airborne contaminants near their point of generation 3. The use of air pressure relationships that define the direction of airflow into the cabinet 4. The use of HEPA filtration on all potentially contaminated exhaust streams Deactivation: Treatment of an HD contam inant on surfaces with a chemical, heat, ultraviolet light, or another agent to transform the HD into a less hazardous agent. Decontamination: Inactivation, neutralization, or removal of HD contaminants on surfaces, usually by chemical means.

If this indicator is selected, none of the following Hygiene, Mobility, or Diet indicators can be checked. Hygiene: Moderate assist/ supervise The patient needs partial assistance, supervision and/or encouragement to accomplish various hygiene activities. If the patient needs help only to wash his/her back, this indicator should not be checked. This item should not be checked if the patient requires complete or maximum assistance and/or supervision with hygiene needs. Mobility: Moderate assist/supervise OR The patient can assist in turning or positioning in bed, but cannot move and/or ambulate independently. The patient may need help in maintaining proper body alignment. Mobility or hygiene: Maximum assist/supervise The patient requires complete assistance in turning, positioning, range of motion, and/or ambulation. The patient can not, will not, or should not accomplish these activities without the constant presence, supervision, and/or assistance of staff. This indicator should also be ch ecked if the patient requires complete assistance with hygiene (toileting, bathing, grooming). Either \"Moderate assist\" or \"Maxim um assist\" may be checked, but not both. Note: If the patient is NPO, neither of the \"Diet\" indicators should be checked. Diet: Moderate assist/supervise OR The patient can feed him/herself after help with opening cartons, cutting meat, etc. The patient may require supervision and/or encouragement to eat. Poststroke patient who needs close observation. Aspiration Precautions including Passy Muir Valve. Diet: Maximum assist/supervise The patient needs to be fed, or needs constant supervision and/or encouragement. He/she may require tube feedings bolus with or without residuals. TPN is not included and should be accounted for in the appraisal of the amount of assessment and intervention required. Either \"Moderate assist\" or \"Maximum assist\" may be checked, not both. Note: Do not check for saline lock with routine flushes. IV; or Saline lock with additives The patient has an IV and/or saline lock with additives. Note: The following \"Assess/intervene\" care indicators should reflect the frequency, duration, complexity , and/or intensity of assessment and/or intervention required by the patient in the following five areas: 1) medications; 2) treatments; 3) procedures; 4) teaching; an d/or 5) psychosocial support. This care is over and above the care already indicated, and should include patient and family characteristics such as emotional state, age or developmental stage, language ability, and/or cultural issues which may impact the level of assessment/intervention. Assess/intervene: Average OR The patient requires assessment and intervention every 4 hours such as routine vital signs, IV checks, dressing checks, wound checks, shift assessment. Medication passes take 15 minutes or less. Patients may be receiving 3 or less IVPB. Patients that are on drips that require q 4 to 6 hour interventions. Tele/CPO patient who is asymptomatic with routine monitoring requiring min interventions. The patient and/or family may require uncomplicated teaching around diagnosis/proce dure/medications. Emotional support is met with routine rounding. Assess/intervene: Above average OR The patient requires assessment and intervention every 2 hours: such as checks for vital signs, neuro status, blood glucose monitoring, epidural catheter, dressings, or frequent treatments, and/or procedures. Medication passes take longer than 15 minutes but less than 30 minutes. Patients may be receiving 4 or more IVPB. The patient may be on telemetry/CPO and having arrhythmias/respiratory complications which require interventions/treatments q 2 hours. The patient and/or family teaching is more complicated focus is typically on a new diagnosis i.e. TBI, stroke, newly diagnosed diabetes. Emotionally the patient and family require more support than is met with routine rounding. Assess/intervene: Almost constant This patient's need for care arises from frequent, multiple, complex, and/or prolonged treatments, procedures, or other associated problems that require almost constant assessment and/or intervention every hour or more frequently i.e. active alcohol withdraw, CBI. Chemo patients receiving their first treatment, IV push therapy or highly reactive chemo agents being used. Medication passes require more than 30 minutes. The care may be further complicated by the need for restraints because of agitation, or IV drips necessitating frequent monitoring, etc. The patient with time limited assessment/intervention of q 1 hour for 6 hours or less should not be listed as constant; but, Above Average. The patient and/or family members may be cognitively impaired and require constant education. Patient may require an above average amount of psychosocial, emotional support. Only one of the \"Assess/intervene\" indicators may be checked. If a patient requires almost constant intervention, in most instances, the patient should be classified as Level 4 regardless of the number of checks in each column. (continued next page) Appendix C: Evalysis\u00ae Patient Classification System: Care Indicator Instructions to Calculate Acute Acuity Level Score CARE INDICATOR INSTRUCTIONS Note: The next two care indicators relate to the complexity of \"Care management\" and involve the level of effort associated with the planning, coordination, and management of the patient's care. If the patient's care management is relatively routine and/or uncomplicated, neither of these indicators should be selected. Care management: Moderately complex The patient's physiological, psychological, social, an d/or spiritual condition and/or circumstances require a considerable amount of planning, coordination, and management by the nurse. These care management activities require an above average amount of interaction with others to plan and manage the care. Examples Patient may have a language barrier, the nurse may be making multiple ca lls to coordinate care of 3 or more procedures. Care management: Very complex The patient's physiological, psychological, social, and/or spiritual condition and/or circumstances are extremely complicated, numerous, and/or difficult to manage requiring an unusual amount of planning, coordination, and management by the nurse. These care management activities require an extraordinary amount of interaction with others to plan and manage the care. Total The check marks are added in each column, and the total of each column is written in the column \"Total\" area. The column with the highest total is the patient's care level. CIRCLE the care level number at the top of the appropriate column. If two columns have the same total, the higher care level is circled. GENERAL REMINDERS 1. Check only those care indicators actually applying to the patient . If a care indicator does not describe the patient's care needs go on to the next care indicato r. These indicators are arranged so that if the patient's care needs do not fit a particular care indicator they will be taken into account in a subsequent indicator within the tool. 2. Remember to check all of the white boxes that foll ow a care indicator if it applies to the patient. For example, the \" IV; or Saline lock with additives \" indicator has three white boxes following it. If the patient has any kind of IV infusion and/or saline lock with additives, check all three white boxes. 3. Total the check marks carefully and circle the a ppropriate care level (1, 2, 3, or 4) in the top section of the tool.

Registered Nurse (RN) will assess need fo r Range of Motion (ROM) and any contraindications consistent with the resident's goal of care. 2. Licensed Nurse (LN), Certified Nurse Assistant (C NA), or Patient Care Assistant (PCA) can perform range of motion exercises. 3. Nursing Assistants receive initial training and competency skill evaluation during orientation or initial restorative basic training . Other trained , competent staff or volunteers may lead residents through Active ROM (AROM). PURPOSE: Range of motion exercises are used to maintain or restore range and maximal function, prevent deformities, stimulate circulation, and enhance a sense of well-being. _________________________________________________________________________________ PROCEDURE: A. Assessment 1. The The RN begins the functional assessment for range of motion needs of new residentsduring the admission assessment. 2. SNF: Functional assessments are complet ed as required by MDS (Section G and/or GG as appropriate) at least annually and when a signifi cant change of condition occurs. Refer to policy 23-02 Completion of Resident Assessment Instrument/Minimum Data Set (RAI/MDS). 1. by completing the physical function sections (G) of the MDS. Functional assessments are then completed at least annually and when a significant change of condition occurs. 2. Assess whether limitations in Range of Motion (ROM) are related to unrelieved joint pain based on resident's report of pain or observation of pain related behaviors, such as moaning, striking out, or grimacing. 3. 3. Further assessment is initiated by requesting aA physician may's order afor physical or occupational therapy consultation on admission or anytime there is an as sessed need, such as an unanticipated functional decline or contracture. 4. 4.5. Consider if resident is high risk for fracture before implementing ROM. B. Planning 1. If appropriate, initiate ROM interventi ons based on assessment or as ordered.. 2. SNF: a. Range of motion programs that are to occur daily or most daysfor 15 min/day generally qualify as restorative and should be care planned as such with maintenance or improvement orientedimprovement-oriented goals. b. Range of motion that is incidental to Acti vities of Daily Living (ADL) only does not qualify as a restorative AROM and/or Passive ROM (PROM) program and does not necessitate a full care plan. File: D6 3.0 March 25, 2014, Revised Range of Motion Exercise LHH Nursing Policies and Procedures 2 1. Refer to policy D 1.0 Restorative Nursing Program. 2. Range of motion that is incidental to Activiti es of Daily Living (ADL) only does not qualify as a restorative Active ROM (AROM) and/or Passive ROM (PROM) program and does not necessitate a full care plan. c. 3. Plan pain management interventions for residents with contractures and/or chronic joint pain to enable resident's maximal participation in the RO M program and to prevent further functional limitation. Gentle ROM is considered an interv ention for degenerative joint disease related pain and high risk for fracture.Acute: a. Acute rehabilitation: provide ROM based on assessment, as ordered, or as part of rehabilitation program in conjunction with rehabilitation therapists as part of the Acute Rehab plan of care. b. Acute medical: provide ROM as appropriate based on assessment or as ordered and as permitted by acute condition. 3.4. Plan pain management interventions for residents wi th contractures and/or chronic joint pain to enable resident's or patient's maximal participat ion in ROM exercises and to prevent further functional limitation. Gentle ROM is consid ered an intervention for degenerative joint disease related pain and high risk for fracture. C. Interventions 1. SNF: Range of motion may be accomplished during bathing, dressing, grooming, or at scheduled times according to resident need or preference, howe ver, range of motion that is incidental to ADLs cannot be considered a restorative nursing program. 1. 2. Provide pain interventions as planned and appropriate. 2. 3. Loosen or remove restrictive clothing or devices. 4. ROM Procedure: Refer to \"Range of Motion Exercises\" on Elsevier Clinical Skills for detailed information: https://epm601.elsevierperformancemanager.com /Personalization/Home?virtualname=sanfrange neralhospital-casanfrancisco 3. PROM a. The LN or nursing assistant provides PROM by moving the body part around a fixed point or joint until the resident's maximum available range of motion is achieved with no assistance from the resident. (See guidelines and illustrations of the PROM te chnique provided at the end of this procedure). b. Precautions during PROM exercises include: i. Support the joint while doing the exercises. Hold the extremity above or below the joint (e.g. elbow, wrist, or knee) and move the joint smoothly, slowly, and gently through its range). ii. Avoid forcing any part of the body to move beyond its free range of motion. iii. Keep movement within a pain-free range, stopping at the point of pain. Appropriate pain medication and non-pharmacological interventions for pain are commonly needed. iv. When \"increased tone\" (spasticity) is present: circul ar motion is more effective in reducing spasticity than direct opposition. Move the joint slowly to the point of resistance. Then exert gentle, steady pressure until the muscle relaxes. File: D6 3.0 March 25, 2014, Revised Range of Motion Exercise LHH Nursing Policies and Procedures 3 v. Do the exercise the same number of times on each side of the body. Move each joint through its range of motion for at least 5 repetitions, at least once and preferably twice daily or as indicated by the care plan. vi. When performing range of motion on upper extremitie s, mobilize the scapulas first to facilitate relaxation in the remainder of the extremity. vii. When working on the lower extrem ities, mobilize the hips first to facilitate relaxation in other lower extremity joints. viii. When working on the back, begin with head and neck flexibility only to the extent that the resident is able to do independently with cueing to prevent head/neck injury. 4. AROM 5. a. AROM is performed by the resident /patient with cueing as needed and supervision from LN or nursing assistant. When the resident does most of the exercise, but needs some assistance with the final stretch, it is still considered active range of motion. a. b. SNF: AROM may be provided in a group with a 1:4 ra tio of staff/ or trained volunteer as part of a Restorative AROM program. Videos, mu sic, and small weights are often used to enhance the program. D. Evaluation / Documentation and Reporting 1. SNF: document minutes of ROM provided. 1. Resident Care Plan (RCP) 2. ROM that is not part of a restorative progra m can be written on the front card of the care plan. a. Document a measurable goal wi th individualized ROM interventions. b. SNF: ROM that is not part of a restor ative program should be care planned, but not included in a restorative care plan. 3. SNF weekly summaries: document ROM progress toward care planned goals or any changes from baseline is addressed with each nursing summa ry to evaluate the resident's response to the program. 4. Acute care plan note: do cument progress toward ca re planned goals every shift. 2. Nursing Summary At minimum, ROM that is only on the front card and not part of a restorative program is addressed in the summary when ch anges from baseline occur. The licensed nurse documents progress in rela tion to restorative nursing goals for AROM or PROM programs in the summary to evaluate the resident's response to the program.

RIGHT DOCUMENTATION O Document the administration of medication in eMAR at the time medication is given utilizing bar code scanning. O If resident is not wearing an armband, or refuses to allow scanning of their arm band, document reason in override section. O If product/medication is not scanned, docu ment the reason in override section. B. OVERRIDE OF MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION 1. If a resident requires urgent attention, use clin ical judgment when deciding to override BCMA in order to provide care. 2. Document override reason. C. TWO LN INDEPENDENT CHECK OF MEDICATIONS: File: J 1.Nov 2 92, 2022, Revised Medication Administration LHH Nursing Policies and Procedures 51. Two LN independent check of medication is t he process by which 2 LNs perform an independent review of the medication to be administered, without prompting or cueing for other LN prior to medication being administered: Each LN reviews the Right resident, Right medication, Right dose, Right route and Right time. Each LN w ill complete their own documentation in EHR. D. CRUSHING MEDICATIONS FOR ORAL ADMINISTRATION 1. Crushing medications is based on nursing judgement and resident care plan. 2. Do not crush hazardous, enteric, sustained release or medications labeled \"do not crush.\" 3. Each resident shall have their own pill cutter, which is cleaned with alcohol wipes between uses. 4. Pill crushers will be cleaned with alcohol wipe at the end of the medication pass prior to returning to medication room for charging, and PRN. 5. Staff may choose to wear mask when crushing or cutting pills. 6. Medications which are to be crushed for adminis tration, must be given individually and should not be combined with other crushed, uncrushed or liquid medications (e.g. in pudding or other similar food), unless pharmacy has reviewed the medications for safety and efficacy, and pharmacy has documented that it is safe to mi x crushed medications together and the physician has placed an order for crushing and combining the medications. 7. When using a food medium (e.g., apple sauce or pudding) to administer medications, the LN will: a. Date and time the food medium container at time of opening. Food medium container should remain on the medication cart if the food medium will be used for multiple residents. Use hand hygiene per protocol between each resident. b. For each individual resident, use a new, clean spoon to remove a portion of the food medium and place it in a different container (e.g., medicine cup or pill crusher cups.) c. If using pudding as the food medium to administer medications, a physician order is required for the pudding. d. The opened food medium must be kept covered throughout the duration of the medication pass and discarded at the end of medication pass. Food medium cannot be stored in or on the medication cart beyond your medication pass time. E. HAZARDOUS MEDICATIONS 1. Special precautions need to be applied when preparing and handling and disposing of hazardous medication. (Refer to Hazardous Drugs Ma nagement LHHPP 25-05). 2. Instructions for administering the medication can be found in administration instructions on the MAR. F. PHYSICIAN ORDER 1. LNs may accept telephone orders from an autho rized prescriber (Refer to LHHPP 25-03) and will confirm resident's medication allergies with prescriber and read back the order entered into the EHR for accuracy with the physician. Verbal orders should only be taken during emergent situations when provider is unable to enter the order due to care being provided to resident. 2. STAT medication orders are processed immediately and administered no later than four hours after the order was written. File: J 1.Nov 2 92, 2022, Revised Medication Administration LHH Nursing Policies and Procedures 63. All other medication orders are administered as soon as the medication is available, unless clinical needs warrant more immediate action. PURPOSE: Medications will be competently and safely administered PROCEDURE: 1. Once determined medications are due, and eMAR has been reviewed, minimize distractions or interruptions from preparation to documentation. 2. Determine which resident(s) need medication(s) pulled from Omnicell for this medication pass time only. Do not pull for future med pass times. a. Pull those resident's cassettes from medicati on cart and place on top of WOW, or bring med cart inside med room if space permits. i. Ensure each cassette is labeled with the correct resident name. ii. Do not overcrowd the WOW with too many cassettes. b. Bring WOW with the resident(s) medicati on cassette(s) into the medication room. i. If using medication cart with computer screen attached, bring the entire cart into the medication room. c. Use resident's order in EHR to retrieve m edication from Omnicell for 1 resident at a time. d. Physically count the medication found in the Omnicell bin and confirm it matches the Omnicell screen count prior to removing the medication. i. If the count is off, immediately notify yo ur charge nurse and/or nursing supervisor. e. Once confirmed medication is correct, immedi ately put the medication(s) into the appropriate resident cassette. f. Repeat this for each resident that need medication(s) removed if needed. g. Return to medication cart with WOW and ca ssettes and put cassettes in medication cart. i. Do not place any medication(s) in pockets, cups or other containers. Medications must be placed in appropriate resident cassette, and immediately followed by placing cassettes in medication cart. 3. Log into the EHR and review the medications which will be administered. Remove those medications from resident's cassette and place on top of WO W. Bring the WOW with only the medications to be administered and needed supplies to the resident's side. 4. Confirm with the resident that they are ready to receive their medications in the location they are located if they are not in their room, such as the great room. 5. Scan the arm band of resident to correc tly identify resident and open their MAR. a. If the resident is wearing their arm band, this w ill serve as is one form of identification. Then, use a second form of identification to confirm you are administering to the Right Resident. b. If the resident is not wearing arm band, navi gate to the MAR of the resident who will receive the medications. c. Use two forms of identification to confir m the Right Resident. Document an override, and then select the reason why bar code scanning of the resident is not used. 6. Scan medication(s) barcode(s) at bedside/chairside. 7. Compare each medication package to the medication prescribed in the MAR according to first 5 Rights. File: J 1.Nov 2 92, 2022, Revised Medication Administration LHH Nursing Policies and Procedures 7 8. Immediately prepare medication (s), if appropriate. (e.g., crush) , and administer medication(s). a. If this is the first dose being given, docum ent that the \"1st dose\" resident education has been performed as appropriate. 9. Remain with the resident until all medications have been taken. a. Never leave medications at the bedside/chairside. 10. Document in real time in the EHR medication(s) given, not given, etc. 11. Log out of the EHR. If medication cassette wa s brought to bedside, disinfect it and return the cassette to the medication cart. ADMINISTRATION OF MEDICATION(S) THROUGH ENTERAL TUBE 1. Request medications be in liquid form whenever possible. If liquid form is not available from the Pharmacy, and a tablet form must be used, crush the tablets (except for enteric coated, hazardous or sustained release medications). 2. Do not add medication directly to an enteral feeding formula. 3. Prior to administering the medication, stop the fe eding and flush the tube with at least 15 mL of water. 4. Dissolve the tablets, or dilute the medication in at least 30 mL of water, to sufficiently allow for medication to pass through the tube. 5. Each medication should be administered separat ely. After each medication flush the tube with 15 mL of water. 6. Administer diluted medications or fluids throu gh enteral tubes by gravity or gentle flush using a 60 mL catheter-tip syringe. 7. Give medication at the appropriate time in relation to feeding. a. Some medications should be given with food, while some should be given on an empty stomach with tube feeding stopped for a prescr ibed interval before and after medication is given (e.g., Dilantin suspension). b. For proper action, some medications must be del ivered into the stomach rather than into the duodenum or jejunum. c. Consult with pharmacist about administration an d drug-drug or drug-nutrient compatibility. 8. Elevate the resident's head of the bed to a mi nimum of 30 degrees unless ot herwise ordered by the physician before administering medication, and for 30 minutes after administration of medication to decrease risk of gastroesophageal reflux and/or aspiration. 9. Confirm correct placement of enteral tube (refer to NPP E 5.0 Enteral Tube Management). 10. Nutritional formula may be given before medications. To flush formula from the tube prior to instilling medication, flush the tube with approximately 15 mL of water using gravity or gentle flush with the syringe. 11. After all medication(s) is administered, instill approximately 15 mL of water to flush medication. File: J 1.Nov 2 92, 2022, Revised Medication Administration LHH Nursing Policies and Procedures 8 12. If a resident is on fluid regulation, and requires a different flushing schedule, a physician must place order which includes the amount of water to be used for the flushing between each crushed medication. 13. Document the amount of the flush used for medication administration in the flowsheet. ADMINISTRATION OF NARCOTIC (OPIATE) MEDICATIONS 1. Narcotic medication administration may happen requires a two LN independent check of medication administration. 2. Prior to entering the resident's room, LN shall request 2nd LN to serve as witness for observation and dual sign off of narcotic administration. 3. As needed, and for newly admitted residents, the LN will explain to resident that due to hospital safety reasons, a second licen sed nurse will observe them ta ke their opioid medications a.1. Aafter performing the six rights of medication ad ministration and administering the narcotic medication, LNs will confirm resident has swallowed the medication by: i. Visually inspecting the mouth by request ing the resident opens their mouth and lifts their tongue to view entire mouth. ii. Request the resident to repeat a sentence such as \"no, ifs, ands, or buts,\" to ensure the oral medication have been swallowed. b. If resident declines 2nd LN observation, notify the resident the narcotic medication will be held and notify provider for further guidance. i. Notify the physician of refusal to follow protocol and request for follow-up such as change of order to liquid opioids or crushed medications. ii. If resident initially agrees to new procedure but then refuses to open mouth for inspection, stay with resident and ask 2nd LN to notify charge nurse to call physician. iii. Notify resident care team of refusal for discussion of alternatives and interventions. iv.iii. Document occurrence in a nursing note and update care plan . 4.2. Administration of buprenorphine-naloxone. a. Buprenorphine-naloxone should not be swallow ed and must be allowed to dissolve in the mouth; therefore, verification of swallow per standard narcotic administration should not be performed.. b. Buprenorphine administration is as follows: i. Place the sublingual tablet or film under the tongue and keep in place until fully dissolved. 1. 5-10 minutes for sublingual tablet 2. 3-8 minutes for film ii. Resident should not eat, drink, smoke or talk until the film/tablet is completely dissolved. iii. If other medications are needed at the same time, give these medications prior to buprenorphine-naloxone administration. c. For buprenorphine induction, physician may orde r clinical opiate withdrawal scale (COWS). i. If ordered, document COWS in EHR COWS nursing flowsheet. ADMINISTRATION OF AEROSOL/NEBULIZER MEDICATIONS A. Monitor resident 1. Before administering the initial treatment, moni tor the resident's ability to participate in the medication administration process, and to ascertain the most appropriate gas delivery device (e.g., mouthpiece, mask, etc.). File: J 1.Nov 2 92, 2022, Revised Medication Administration LHH Nursing Policies and Procedures 92. Whenever the resident's condition warrants, and/or per physician's order, monitor heart rate and auscultate lung sounds before and after treatment administration, especially when giving a new medication or when there has been a change in the treatment. 3. Residents who are unable to self-manage the deliv ery system safely and effectively require frequent or continuous monitoring to ensure proper medication delivery. B. Administration 1. Refer to Appendix 4, follow Manufacturer's Instru ctions, and/or consult with Pharmacy or Nursing Education for clarification for appropriate use of inhaled medication devices. 2. When using multiple puffs of the same medica tion, allow at least 1 minute to elapse between each puff. 3. When using multiple inhaled medications, wait 5 to 10 minutes between drugs to get maximum benefit. NOTE: If both bronchodilator and a steroid inhaler are prescribed, use the bronchodilator first. 4. When using a steroid inhaler, rinse the mouth a fterwards to help reduce dry mouth, hoarseness, and to prevent fungal growth. 5. Compressor/ Nebulizer (brand name Misty-Fast) a. Use with nebulizer face mask, which has medication cup and lid. b. Pour medication into the cup. Connect t he blue end of the tubing to the cup, and the green end of the tubing to the air source. c. Air source i. Nebulizer machine: Do not place machine on soft surfaces. Turn on the machine until mist is no longer produced. ii. Compressed wall air: Turn on the flow rate at 8 liters per minute for 3-4 minutes or until mist is no longer produced. iii. For residents with a physician's order fo r oxygen and the resident is not a known carbon dioxide (CO 2) retainer: Oxygen may be used as a delivery method. If using oxygen, set the liter flow at 8 liters per minut e for 3-4 minutes, or until mist is no longer produced. Thereafter, set the oxygen at the flow rate prescribed by the physician. d. For residents able to follow instructions, encourage resident to breathe as calmly, deeply, and evenly as tolerated until the nebulizer stops producing mist. C. Assessing Resident during treatment and for the effectiveness of treatment . 1. Briefly stop the treatment if rest is needed . Provide assisted coughing and expectoration as needed and suction as clinically indicated. 2. Assess the resident's response to treatment. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS: 1. If the resident does not wish to take medication(s) at the prescribed time, you may attempt to return and administer at a later time, if medication is still unopened and in the original packaging. 2. If medication(s) is not given within the time schedule, review \"Appendix II: Specific Medication Administration Times and Abbreviations\" to avoid giving time sensitive medications outside acceptable timeframe and according to special considerations.
