Subscribe to Our Newsletter was that time of the year again. The Life Positive Expo 2012, the Internal festival of Holistic living being held at India Habitat Centre, Delhi (27th, 28th and 29th of January) time attracted hundreds of masters, healers, practitioners of alternative therapies and spiritual seekers. I am grateful to have had an opportunity to be a part of this great gathering of spiritually inclined souls. Before I reached there, I must admit that I was skeptical about the expo. My training has been in the field of conventional medicine; allopathy to be more precise. We've always been taught to look for disease and treat it. To unlearn all that knowledge I possess and to begin afresh from the principles of healing was going to be a challenge, I thought. However, I was pleasantly surprised to be witness to logic, proof and practical exercises in each of the workshops conducted there. I am now a convert and do believe thoroughly in holistic living and health. That there is a mind-body connection and that it is possible to affect your health positively with positive thoughts and energy. Click here to find out more. Brahma Kumari - B K Shivani Day 1 started with the inaugural address by renowned Brahma Kumari B K Shivani. Her discourse on relationships was very apt for the modern day anguish most youngsters go through these days. \"Try and recognize signs of poor emotional health like jealousy, bitterness, frustration and anger and forbearing with them as you would be with somebody suffering from poor physical health\" she said. This enlightening discourse set the positivity quotient for the sessions to come.

Suma added that one's capacity to laugh is the measure of one's life force. The whole hall reverberated with laughter when hilarious excerpts from the book were shared. Indeed, there is a spiritual side to laughter and a lighter side to spirituality! <PreviousNext> Sun Yoga - Yogi Umashankarji Day two started on a great note when people braved the Delhi cold and landed up for [Sun Yoga with Yogi Umashankarji](http://www.sunyoga.info/). By 'making friends with the sun', this Yogi has been able to conquer thirst, hunger, sleep, disease and material desires. During the first five minutes of the practical session, most of us were unable to even look at the sun. However, he urged us to follow his instructions and continue. Within 10 minutes, we all felt calmer and were able to gaze the sun for 20 minutes straight without problems.

She shared with the audience how she healed a football-sized tumor in her abdomen with cellular healing. According to her, all diseases arise from painful memories that get stored in the human cells when denied natural release. With cellular healing, one could access these memories and flush them out to regain health. During her interactive session, she made delegates experience cellular healing with two simple exercises. By the end of the session, all of us were looking forward to signing up for her upcoming sessions in the various Indian cities. <PreviousNext> The Sound Journey by G L Sampoorna The most enjoyable workshop where the audience participation was the highest was ' [The sound journey' By G L Sampoorna ](http://www.glsampoorna.com/), the renowned Sound therapist. Sound in any form, audible or inaudible affects us depending on its frequency. As a child, we feel free to coo, cry, laugh or giggle whenever or wherever we want to. However, as we grow, we stop making the sounds that come naturally to us. We should return to some simple sounds like a sigh when tired or groan when in pain, she said. Each of these sounds have vibrational frequencies which have healing powers and can penetrate psychological blocks in the journey to find balance. She made us practice certain vowel sounds each of which is supposedly connected to the chakras. Whether she made us 'buzz' to help us clear our sinuses or 'hum' and connect with our inner child, all of us thoroughly enjoyed this session. <PreviousNext> Maa Gyan Suvera Day Ho' opono-pono, meant to make and 'Opono pono' meant to rectify). Thus, the Hawaiian phrase literally means 'to make things all right'. The art of forgiveness and making amends is the heart of this ancient technique. This simple technique has some very practical rules everyone can add to their routine to experience the transformation it can bring. One needs to start a Ho' opono pono diary and write \"I, XXX (name), forgive everyone and everyone forgives me\". Writing this for 70 times each for seven cycles is a must. In addition to this, one needs to chant the Ho' opono pono chant, \"I love you, I am sorry, please forgive me, thank you\". Just 20 minutes a day chanting this is enough to start you on the road to transformation, she said. <PreviousNext> Deep listening - Jasmine Bharathan In this modern age, we are distracted all the time and clearly are unable to be mindfully present in the moment. The session by [Jasmine Bharathan](http://www.heal-empower.com/), a practitioner of Transpersonal psychology was a very relevant one for the audience. Deep listening helps us connect with unspoken feelings and makes the other feel heard and understood. Jasmine said that we needed to give ourselves permission to feel emotions as natural as they come. Our upbringing has made us believe that a display of emotions isn't good and is a sign of weakness. She taught us EFT (Emotional Freedom technique) and TAT (Tapas Acupressure technique), to bring awareness to our breath. <PreviousNext> Swami Nikhilananda, head, Chinmaya Mission Delhi, ended the three-day expo with an enlightening valedictory note. He equated the Life Positive Expo with the Kumbh Mela in Prayag, saying that this is where urban young minds meet and consciousness is raised by honoring the soul in the body. He expounded the nine principles by which one can attain a divine life. These included Vivek (ability to discriminate), Vairagya (ability to say no what is undesirable), Shama (calmness), Dama (control over our senses), Uparama (ability to let of superfluous activities), Titiksha (equanimity), Shraddha (deep faith), Samadhan (capacity to focus on the goal), Mukshatwam (desire for enlightenment). He concluded with telling us that we need to make friends with our mind. The mind will then think of our happiness first before hopping around like a squirrel. <Previous Next> Along with the enlightening workshops, the expo also saw some interesting stalls Tej Gyan Foundation (by Pune-based Guru Naik (who introduced us to VEMSY or Vaastu Energy Management System), Prana Violet healing by Siva P, Theta Healing (with Suman Kant Kaul), scientific palmistry Sumeet Kant Mansee feedback biofeedback techniques (by Gunjan Human Karigar) and more. Summing it up, the three days spent at the Life Positive Expo were indeed the most enlightening ones in my life. We, at www.thehealthsite.com, aim to bring you more on holistic living soon.
