Brig. Gen. Jeannine Ryder, who serves as the 59th Medical Wing commander, San Antonio Military Health System market director, and Air Force Nurse Corps chief, presided over the ceremony in which Col. Alisha Smith relinquished command to Col. Anthony Mitchell. \"In the last two years, the (59th MDOG) has established initiatives and worked our processes to serve our patients better and deliver a ready force and ready medics,\" said Ryder. The 59th MDOG operates the Department of Defense's largest ambulatory surgical center and 43 specialty clinics.

You are an amazing team of professionals, and it has truly been my honor to serve with you all.\" Smith is succeeded in command by Col. Anthony Mitchell, who in his first speech as the 59th MDOG commander spoke of the gravity of the military medical profession. \"This is serious business: service, life, and death. The beneficiaries we take care of have earned their way through someone's sacrifice, someone's service,\" said Mitchell. \"For a medic, \"service before self\" means something a little bit different. It means that we are committed to being ready and willing to provide health and healing if we can, but comfort always; to always be ready, anytime, anywhere; to do things other people cannot do and to go places other people will not go; to fulfill the promise to those who wore this uniform and to their families, and to our nation, that no matter where you are, if you are in harm's way, there will be a "}
