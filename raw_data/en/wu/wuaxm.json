International AG , Stadtturmstrasse 10, 5400 Baden, Switzerland. pd.becker@bsp.ch According to most neurologists, 80% of all decisions are made emotionally. In fact, 75% of all buying - decisions are made within the first three to five minutes of an initial contact. In this regard, it is quite astonishing that when we communicate or when we \"sell\" our ideas , emotions are heavily neglected. In Paul -David Becker's Plenary Lecture , you will discover the essence of these emotions. Moreover, you will learn about the significance of three neurological facts to boost your confidence in communicating effectively , to strengthen your non- verbal communication impact, and to help you better differentiate yourself from the rest by conveying more personal profile. In a nutshell, you will experience the fundamentals of emotional communication , ultimately helping you to make a greater impact on others in the future. PL-01 Transition Metal-Triggered Protein A ctivation and S ignaling in L iving S ystems Peng Chen1 1Department of Chemical Biology, College of Chemistry, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China Employing chemical compounds or reagents to modulate the function of an intracellular protein of interest, particularly in a gain -of-function fashion, remains highly desired but challenging. In this talk, I will first introduce a \"genetically encoded chemical decaging\" strategy that relies on our developed , transition metal -triggered bioorthogonal cleavage reactions to control protein activation in living sys tems with high spatial and/or temporal resolution. These reactions exhibited high efficiency and low toxicity , which allowed the gain -of-function study of various enzymes in living cells .These novel reactions were also explored as on -demand pro-drug activation strategies for cancer treatment .In the second part of the talk, I will discuss the sig nalling roles of transition metals in mediating bacterial transcription responses. We have recently discovered a novel copper signaling pathway that potentiate dbacterial antibiotic tolerance through a major antibiotic resistance regulator -MarR in E. coli .In contrast to the well appreciated antimicrobial effects of copper from the host immune response, our work reveals that copper was also used by bacteria as a counteracting mechanism to cope with antibiotic stress . A novel zinc - triggered allosteric activa tion of a transcription factor will also be discussed at the end of the talk. Financial support by NSFC is gratefully acknowledged.

Paul Walton1 1Department of Chemistry, University of York, Heslington, York, UK, YO10 5DD . Over nearly all scientific organisations, across every country and across time one finds that the progression of women in research/ academia is significantly hindered when compared to men. Such a universal truth represents a nenormous loss of talent ,including in our very own bioinorganic community . Recent years have seen some progress in understanding the principal factors behind this phenomenon and there has been some progress in new schemes which are designed to address the lack of women in senior scientific positions. These schemes have also met with some resistance which, in itself, has been revealing of the reasons why there is such a difference in the progression rates of men andwomen inscience. This presentation disc usses some of those res istances: why they arise; what they reveal about gender (in)equality in our universities, laboratories, groups; and \u2014most importantly \u2014what can be done about them.PL-04 Metallo --Lactamases: A Tug of War B etween Bacteria and the Immune System for the A -lactamases that constitute the latest resistance mechanism of pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria against carbapenems, considered as last resort drugs. Zn(II) binding is critical in the bacterial periplasm, not only to activate these enzymes and provide resistance , but also to stabilize the protein scaffold. During infection, the immune system elicits a response that scavenges the available Zn(II), impacting in the activity of stability of these proteins, thus compromising bacterial survival. However, the activity and stability of these proteins in vitro does not necessarily correlate with those in the periplasm. Thus, the whole picture must be described by means of an integrated approach. We developed a strategy aimed to correlate the biochemical and biophysical f eatures in purified enzymes with those in the bacterial periplasm, ultimately leading to the selected phenotype, i.e., resistance to antibiotics. This strategy allows us to dissect the molecular features that are tailored by accumulating mutations during e volution to endure the action of the immune system response. We have applied this approach to in vitro evolved protein in the laboratory, as well as to natural allelic variants selected in clinical strains. This has allowed us to account for the epistatic interactions between mutations at a structural level. We have also studied the natural evolutionary landscape of allelic variants of a clinically relevant lactamase (NDM), that has been shaped by Zn(II) deprivation conditions. Thus, natural NDM variants with enhanced Zn(II) binding affinity have been selected, overriding the most common evolutionary pressure acting on catalytic efficiency. We also found that this enzyme is being disseminated by being secreted into Outer Membrane Vesicles, that represents a n additional evolutionary advantage.

To i mprove the effects of oncolytic viruses we have introduced a biometal ba sed strategy to boost their efficacy ( 2). Using immuno -modulating, small molecule protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors, specifically vanadium compounds (2,3,4), we are able to enhance the oncolytic virus infection and its anticancer effects in cell lines and animal tumor models . In the following presentation we will describe the results from our resea rch programs on investigation s of the mode of action of this enhancement by vanadium compounds, the nature of the vanadium compound exerting the virus -enhancing and anticancer effect s,and the development of n ovel compounds catered to this application. Importantly, these studies are combined with chemical speciation studies underway to investigate the active species (4).How changes in the responses when the different form of vanadium compounds are tested are identified and used to understand the nature of the vanadium -induced activation of oncolytic virus effects .Furthermore, using complementary biochemical screening methods we are establish ingaconnectivity map pointing to key signaling nodes critical for viral infection and eradication of cancer cells .

Cells adjust metal homeostasis mechanisms depending on cell type, local growth conditions, and in response to stress. Thesesituation spresent opportunities to manipulate cellular metals as a therapeutic strategy across a number of diseases. Here I will pr esent a metallocentric view on utilizing small molecules and peptides that leverage unique metallo biology associated with bacterial and fungal infections to selectively inhibit growth of pathogenic microorganisms .More broadly ,this approach is used to explore how cellular responses at the metallomic level affect and are affected by microbial susceptibility and adaptation to antimicrobial treatment.

Keppler1,2, Walter Berger2,3 1Institute Inorganic Chemistry, , University of Vienna, Austria . 3Institute of Cancer Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center Vienna, Medical University Vienna, Borschkegasse 8a, 1090, Vienna, Austri a The new era of cancer immunotherapy is about to strengthen the role of platinum -based cytotoxics rather than making them obsolete, due to synergies of platinum drugs with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Recent advances in the development of new anticancer platinum drugs are in considerable part based on tumor -targeting approaches. Based on a double -prodrug strategy, we have designed albumin- targeted platinum(IV) complexes, which exert strong activity in various tumor models in vivo. The prodrug bind s rapidly and specifically to endogenous albumin in the bloodstream , which results in distinctly higher drug levels in the blood and tremendously increased plasma half -life.The prodrug then accumulat esin tumor tissue, where platinum(II) species are continuously released by protein degradation and lysosomal reduction of platinum . In vivo experiments revealed highly increased efficacy compared to the corresponding ( clinically used )free drug in terms of both tumor volume reduction and long-term survival . The ruthenium complex IT -139 (KP1339) has been studied in a clinical phase I trial , where t he compound could be safely administered up to adose of 625 mg/m2to patients w hose advanced solid tumors had progress edafter failure of established therapies. Dr ug activity was observed in several tumor entities, most remarkably in gastro -intestinal neuroendocrine tumors [1]. The effects of IT-139 on selected cancer cell lines w ereanalyzed by whole genome expression arrays , where sensitive cell lines showed alterations mainly in gene sets related to response to chemical stimuli and regulation of cell death, while less sensitive cells preferentially activated pathways controlling cell cycle, DNA repair, and metabolism [2]. The r elevance of i nterference with ERhomeostasis for the mode of action was substantiated [3], and cellular signals characteristic for the triggering of immunogenic cell death in vivo were observed in multicellular spheroid model s in vitro [4]. Alack of common chemotherapy -related toxicities, unique mode of action a ndsynergies with other anticancer drugs make IT- 139 a proper candidate for combination therapies. The orally bioavailable gallium complex AP -002 ( KP46 )combines direct anticancer effects with the inhibition of bone breakdown, making itparticularly suitable for treatment of cancer metastatic to the bones .The drug causes Ca2+-triggered calpain activation and downregulation of focal adhesion proteins, followed by anoikis (cell death due to loss of integrin -mediated cell-matrix interactions) , which may outpace induction apoptosis [5]. In addition, damage of mitochondrial morphology and disruption of their functions followed by mitophagy (selective mitochondrial autophagy) has been observed in vitro [6]. Clinical evalua tion of the drug is expected to resume soon. References [1]H.A. Burris, S.Bakewell, J.C. G. Bioinorganic Approaches to Multiple Facets in Alzheimer's Disease Mi Hee Lim1 1Department of Chemistry, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon 34141, Republic of Korea . miheelim@kaist.ac.kr Alzheimer's disease (AD), associated with degeneration of neurons and synapses in the brain, leads to motor impairment and eventual fatality. Neurodegeneration could be related to various interconnected features, including (i) plaque formation from amyloid - (A) peptides, (ii) metal ion dyshomeostasis and miscompartmentalization, as well as (iii) inflammation and increased oxidative stress due to overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The inter -relations between some of these pathological factors have been investigated. Metals are found entangled in the A plaque and contribute to A-related toxicity and oxidative stress. ROS have been shown to increase the rate of A plaque formation. Our understanding of the correlation between these elements and AD pathogenesis has been very limited, however. There is currently no cure for AD; therapies are focused on symptomatic relief targeting the decrease in the levels of acetylcholine, only one of the multiple factors causing the disease [1-4]. To identify an effective cure for AD, we require a better understanding of the relationship between the various causative factors of this devastating disease. Towards this goal, we need suitable chemical tools capable of targeting and regulating its multiple underlying factors simultaneously [2-4]. Herein, the rational design and preparation of our chemical tactics will be discussed with detailed molecular -level investigations of their interactions and reactivities with targets in vitro as well as their efficacies in vivo [3-10].

The talk will illustrate some of the recent results on soft structures based on metal complexes able to aggregate in fiber s, gels and soft mechanochromic materials [1]. The emission of the compounds can be tuned by an appropriate choice of the coordinated ligands as well as of their aggregation in different structures. The formation of soft assemblies allows the tuning of the emission color, by pressure and temperature leading to a new class of materials possessing reversible properties. The monitoring of the different emission properties, used as fingerprint for each of the assembled species, allowed an unprecedented real -time visualization of the evolving self -assemblies [2]. The assemblies can be employed as very sensitive labels for the detection of toxins and drugs [3]. Indeed even though sensing based on fluorescent and luminescent probes are commonly used, the use of aggregates in water allows to distinguish between analytes possessing very similar electronic properties. Sensing can also be done using electrochemiluminescence, ECL. We have recently achieved the first example of aggregation induced ECL showing that assembl ies in solution and in the solid state (deposited on the electrode) can generate bright emission [4]. Finally I wish to close my talk showing novel capsules that can be realized using a unique approach to template virus proteins to reconstruct virus -like particles. We use luminescent Pt(II) -complex amphiphiles, able to form supramolecular structures in water solutions, that can act as templates of viruses capsid proteins. The platinum assemblies can have different morphologies and extremely high emission of which the color depends on the assembly. Interestingly we are able to change the size and shape of the particles even though we use the same natural proteins. The obtained virus -like particles can be visualized by their intense emission at roo m temperature, generated by the self -assembly of the Pt(II) - complexes inside the capside [5].

This includes chemical transformations key to sustainable energy and environment e.g. reduction of H+,O2, CO 2and N 2. Similarly ,mono -oxygenatio n of organic molecules using molecular oxygen, a process often described as the Holy grail of chemistry, requires protons and electrons. Erstwhile mechanistic investigations on metallo -enzyme active sites which catalyses these reactions have revealed that the proton and electron delivery often occur in distinct chemical steps and in many cases , coupled, in the same steps.

Heme proteins are responsible for various biological activities, including electron transfer, oxygen transport /storage, substrate oxidation, signal transduction, etc. Thus, o ligomerization of heme proteins is useful for construction of new materials with coope rative and systematic functions ,and diverse methods have been applied for construction of artificial heme protein oligom ers. 3D domain swapping (herein, domain swapping) is a protein oligomerization phenomenon that exchanges the same domain or secondary structural element between molecules .Domain swapping was first reported in 1994 [1]; since then many proteins have been reported to domain swap. Although domain swapping has been observed in a variety of proteins, there had been only a limited number of reports on domain- swapped heme proteins until recently .Our research group has been showing that various heme proteins domain swap [2,3]. We also found that domain swapping of heme proteins occurs at the early stage of protein folding [4]and may occur in vivo [5].We also utilized domain swapping to construct various heme protein assemblies, including nanorings, cages, hetero dimers with different sites, -binding le monomer -polymer system is gratefully [1]M.J.

Asian J. 13 (2018) 964967.KN-02 The Molybdenum C ofactor and the Greifswald ,Germany . Molybdenum or tungsten containing enzymes are important components of almost any known organism. Except for nitrogenase they typically catalyse the oxygen atom transfer as a two -electron redox process and are involved in the metabolism s of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur. Molybdopterin is a unique ligand in the active sites of these enzymes binding the metal by its dithiolene moiety (see chemical structure below ).It was proposed that this ligand actively participates in electron transfer p rocesses. The chemical synthesis of the molybdopterin ligand has proven to be extremely difficult and the possibly nearest model known today was published by Burgmayer and co- workers in 2012 and then investigated further.1-2In order to synthesize model li gands for MPT reliably, with good yield and with an acceptable amount of work, typically compounds bearing the coordinating dithiolene function and various different substituents on the double bond are considered to model MPT sufficiently well. Most known models, however, do not take into account the electronic influence MPT might have. In order to find a balance between do -ability and suitability of model ligands ,new dithiolenes were developed taking into account several different aspects of the natural m olybdopterin.3-5Particularly interesting example s comprise dithiolene ligands with unprotected pterin moieties, which have shown strong indications of specific binding to the apo- protein of TMAO reductase. In order to model cofactors of higher developed organisms another fundamental challenge is to synthesize mono -dithiolene molybdenum model complexes which are much more difficult to prepare than bis -dithiolene complexes. In this context we introduced a photosynthetic approach to this type of chemistry. Th e most promising synthesized structural model complexes were further investigated also as functional mimics in oxygen atom transfer reactions (OAT).

Hannon1 1School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, B91 1RG, UK . m.j.hannon@bham.ac.uk We have developed a new class of metallo -supramolecular agents that bind strongly and preferentially to DNA and RNA Y -shaped junctions (3 -way junctions; forks; bulges) in vitro and prevent DNA transactions. They are taken up readily into cells and rapidly localise in cell nuclei, where the fork - binding agents interfere with the processing of DNA leading to cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis, without inducing genotoxicity or mutagenicity [1 , 2]. Excitingly some agents show potent anti -viral activities through recognition of a specific RNA bulge motif in the HIV genome, and have agents with high anti -viral activity at concentration levels where the compounds are not cytotoxic to mammalian cells [ 3]. Beyond the genome, DNA can also be used to create inte resting synthetic nanostructures.

In nature, there are many kinds of unique protein assemblies including rings, sheets, tubes and cages, which are formed by multiple interactions such as electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic contacts, coordination etc. These beautiful composites have encourage d us to generate new nanobiomaterials. Our group has focused on a specific interaction between heme and the heme pocket of a hemoprotein to drive construction of the supramolecular hemoprotein assembles A series of familiar hemoproteins have a cofactor, protoporphyrin IX iron complex (heme b ), which is bound in the heme pocket via Fe -axial ligand coordination and non- covalent interaction with high affinity (Ka= 1010-1015M-1). The cofactor is removable from the heme pocket under acidic conditions to yield a corresponding apoprotein. Furthermore, the incorporation of an artificial cofactor into the apoprotein is capable of providing the reconstituted protein. Over the last decade, we have focused on the heme - substitution with several porphyrinoid metal complexes to generate a biohybrid catalyst.1In addition, we have introduced a heme moiety onto the hemoprotein surface via a covalent linkage a a 4 -helix bundle having no cysteine residue. First, we prepared a cytochrome b 562H63C mutant where the His63 residue was replaced with a cystein e residue. Next, a modified heme containing a maleimide group at the terminal of one heme propionate side chain was linked to the cysteine residue on the protein surface via a covalent bond. After the removal of native heme from the modified protein, the heme -linked apoprotein allowed us to yield the fibrous hemoprotein polymer via the heme -heme pocket interaction. In addition , it is found that the heme -attachment at Cys80 in an N80C mutant provides more rigid and periodic supramolecular structure with h eme-heme exciton coupling .3 Furthermore, we have recently used a naturally occurring assembled hemoprotein, HTHP (hexameric tyrosi ne-coordinated hemoprotein), system. The reconstituted HTHP where heme is replaced with zinc protoporphyrin IX or zinc chlorine e6 is found to show the energy migration within the protein. Moreover, a nHTHP cluster was also generated by supramolecular interaction.4 In this presentation, we will demonstrate two examples of hemoprotein assemblies as sho wnin Figure 1 and discuss these physicochemical properties.

One example is the recent demonstration that the strong binding of polynuclear platinum complexes (PPCs) to sulfated -oligosaccharides provides a new approach to glycan - based targeting, based on disruption of the heparan sulfate (HS)/heparanase interaction, through metalloshielding of critical sulfate residues involved in recognition [2,3,4].Understanding these interact ions on long, high MW biomolecules requires understanding at the single unique mono/disaccharide level, just as early M- DNA chemistry was concentrated on single purine and pyrimidine chemistry to understand nucleobase /nucleoside/nucleotide we used [1H, NMR to explore the aquation of the trinuclear clinical agent Triplatin with D-glucosamine residues containing varied O and N -sulfate or N-acetyl substitutions, which represent monosaccharide fragments present within the repeating disaccharide sequences of cell surface HS [5].Comparison of the reactions with monosulfated GlcNS and GlcNAc(6S) reveal the higher reactivity of Triplatin with the 2 -N-sulfate compared to the 6-O-sulfate, but a more rapid liberation.

In the DMSO reductase family of molybdenum enzymes present only in prokaryotes, the molybdenum coordination sphere generally is composed of two dithiol ene groups from two molybdopterin (MPT) guanine dinucleotide (MGD) molecules, one amino acid ligand from the protein backbone and a Mo=O group as sixth ligand. Moco biosynthesis in E. coli seems to be more complex than previously suggested, since a novel form of the cofactor has been identified recently in addition to modifications in the ligand sphere of the molybdenum atom. As novel Moco intermediate, bis - Mo-MPT has been revealed, a cofactor that is used by the YdhV protein. Additionally, in recent studies it became obvious that several molybdoenzymes harbor a sulfido- ligand instead of the oxo group at the bis - MGD cofactor. This modification was recently identified to be present in the Escherichia coli TMAO reductase TorA when purified under anaerobic conditions. The role of the sulfur ligand for the reaction mechanism of these enzymes is not clear so far. An overview of the large diversity of modifications at Moco in bacteria will be presented.KN-08 Anticancer Platinum(IV) Prodrug C and Their rocesses Wee Han Ang1,2, Jun Xiang Ong1, Violet Eng Yee Lee1,2 1Department of Chemistry, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117543. 2NUS Graduate School of Integrative Science and Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore 119077. chmawh@nus.edu.sg Platinum(II) -based anticancer drugs, cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin, are some of the most effective chemotherapies used in clinic. Their cytotoxic activities against cancer cells stems from a combination of processes including cell entry, drug activation, DNA -binding and transcription inhibition, resulting in apoptotic cell death. Due to limitations in platinum -based therapy arising from toxicity, h igh side-effects and incidence of drug resistance, there have been a renewed interest in harnessing the versatility of platinum(IV) carboxylates as prodrug complexes are engendered wi th improved aqueous stability and can be functionalised with targeting groups to enhance delivery, thereby overcoming some of the aforementioned limitations. I will be discussing a facile strategy of conjugating peptides to platinum(IV) prodrug complexes w ith the aim of achieving targeted delivery as well as their use as an adjuvant. In particular, I will also report a rationally -designed platinum(IV) -peptide prodrug conjugate that activates immune cells as immuno -chemotherapeutic agents for cancer therapy.

Sacconi 6, Sesto Fiorentino, Italy .banci@cerm.unifi.it The description and understanding of metal trafficking processes in t he cell require the integration of several approaches, from bioinformatics and computation tools to experimental investigations. Specific bioinformatics tools for genome analysis will allow the identification of metal binding sequences. Metal binding prote ins can be then experimentally characterized in terms of structural features, metal coordination properties, interactions with partners and metal transfer processes. On these aspects NMR spectroscopy is a unique tool not only for characterizing the structu ral and dynamical properties but also foranalys ingfunctional processes possibly in a cellular context. Metal transfer processes occur through a series of protein -protein transient interactions1. Metal transfer is determined by metal affinity gradients among the various proteins, with kinetic factors contributing to the selectivity of the processes2. The characterization of these processes and the understanding of the molecular pathways require their description both at system (e.g. a cell) and at molecula r level, (e.g. atomic -resolution characterization of biomolecules). This approach calls for the development of suitable methodologies, capable of addressing multiple, specific, and sometimes non -conventional, aspects and amenable to characterize functional processes in living cells3.Specifically, in -cell NMR can provide the description of these processes within living cells4. Furthermore, the presence of paramagnetic centers, such as iron -sulfur clusters, which dramatically affects the NMR spectra, requires tailored experiments, possibly integrated with EPR spectra5-7. A few pathways responsible for cellular copper trafficking and for the biogenesis of iron- sulfur proteins will be presented. Through an integrated approach, by increasing the complexity from single protein structures to protein complexes to the functional reaction steps, the processes are described in their cellular context within a molecular perspective.

Angelo, via Cintia 45, 80126 Naples, Italy. In nature, energy storage and small -molecule activation reactions are catalyzed by enzymes that facilitate multi -electron, multi -proton reactions. Inspired by nature's catalysts, we are employing simple metallopeptides and metalloporphyrin- peptide assemblies as catalysts of energy -relevant reactions. In this talk, the catalytic activity of these engineered mini -enzymes toward the reduction of aqueous protons and nitrite will be described . The first of these catalysts is acetylat ed microperoxidase -11 (CoMP11- Ac). CoMP11- Ac isan electrocatalyst for hydrogen production from water at neutral pH with high faradaic efficiency and low sensitivity to oxygen [1]. CoMP11- Ac shows remarkable stability through a range of pH values, and we take advantage of this stability to investigate the mechanism of hydrogen production as a function of pH. We demonstrate that solution pH and the choice of buffer influence the mechanism of the electrocatalytic reaction . A related cataly stis cobalt mimochrome VI*a (CoMC6*a), a small synthetic protein consisting of a cobalt deuteroporphyrin and two covalently attached peptides. One of these peptides provides an axial His ligand (proximal peptide) and the other covers the distal face of th e porphyrin. The structure of CoMC6*a can be altered by changing solution conditions, and we show that enhancing folding decreases the overpotential for hydrogen production [2]. Furthermore, through the use of a series of buffer species with varied structu res and pK avalues, we show that the pK aand the steric bulk of the buffer both impact the mechanism of the reaction. These results demonstrate that buffer species impact not only solution pH but also can play a direct role in determining reaction mechanism for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Finally, we report results on cobalt complexes of peptides with the sequence XXH, models of the amino -terminal copper -and nickel -binding proton reduction electrocatalytically [4] and in the presence of a photosensitizer. Furthermore, CoGGH shows remarkable activity toward nitrite reduction, yielding ammonium as a major product [5]. Optimization of conditions for catalytic activity and ongoing studies of mechanism will be discussed.

Metal -based compounds show improved light -absorption properties compared to many organic drugs. Still, in anticancer phototherapy shifting the absorption spectrum of light- activated metallodrug sintothe photodynamic window (600- 1000 nm), where light penetration is good, remains a challenge for inorganic photochemists. One strategy to design light -activated metal complexes that absorb at higher wavelength s is to introduce cyclometallation, i.e. polydentate ligands containing a phenyl group that, upon metal lation, generate a metal -carbon bond. The resulting anionic carbon -based ligand strongly shifts the orbitals and energy levels of the metal complex, which in turns influences its photochemistry and phototherapeutic properties. In addition, changing a nitrogen- based ligand into a carbon -based ligand often generates a series of different isomers, the preparation of which can become challenging. In this presentation I will describe the synthesis ,photochemistry ,and photobiology ,of a series of cyclometallated metal complexes based on palladium, ruthenium, and platinum , and discuss the opportunities and challenges generated by cyclometallated metal complex esfor anticancer phototherapy .

The malfunctioning of these enzymes has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and motor neuron diseases), as well as autoimmune disorders. C rystal structures of resting and substrate -bound mammalian CDOs reveal edtwo surprising structural motifs in the first and second coordination spheres of the Fe center (Figure below , prepared using PDB code 4JTO []). The first is the existence of a neutral three histidine (3 -His) facial triad that coordinates the Fe ion, as opposed to an anionic 2- His-1-carboxylate facial triad that is typically observed in mononuclear non - heme Fe(II) dioxygenases .The second is the presence of a covalent crosslink between the sulfur of C93 and an ortho carbon of Y157 (mouse CDO numbering scheme). The exact role that these unusual structural features play in CDO catalysis remains unknown. Compared to CDO, ADO is very poorly characterized. While ADO has not yet been structurally characterized by X -ray crystallography, a comparison of mammalian ADO sequences with those of homologs present in other eukaryotes revealed that the 3 -His facial triad that coordinates the Fe ion in CDO is likely preserved in ADOs [1].Additionally, a recent study provided evidence for the exis tence of a similar cysteine -tyrosine [3].To explore the structure/function relationships for CDO and better characterize the ADO active site, we have utilized a combination of spectroscopic and computation al tools. Importantly, we have successfully performed the first spectroscopic characterization of the ADO active site in the presence of substrate (analogues). Collectively, our results provide significant new insight into the origin of the striking substr ate selectivity displayed by CDO and ADO that allows organisms to independently regulate cysteine and cysteamine levels in vivo .

The reaction is cataly zed by the enzyme nitrogenase (Fig. 1A), a two -compone nt metalloprotein ofwhich classes are known, employing either molybdenum, vanadium (Fig. 1B) or only iron at its active site. Nitrogenases catalyze the reduction of N 2to 2 NH 3, with a concomitant release of H 2that occurs at a stoichiometry of at least 1 H 2per N 2reduced . In the enzyme, the transfer of four electrons to the active site cofactor is a prerequisite for the binding and activation of N 2. While a kinetic model by Thorneley and Lowe already described these features in the 1980s (Fig. 1C) , it only recently was understood to be due to a reductive elimination of H 2that leaves the enzyme in a super -reduced state able to break the N 2triple bond. After the recent reporting of the first ligand -bound structure of nitrogenases, a CO -inhibited co mplex of the Mo-dependent enzyme, we have now characterized a reaction intermediate bound to the vanadium - containing variant. These data reveal the actual reactive center to be a dinuclear iron site on a highly reduced cluster, providing direct clues for t he mechanism of dinitrogen reduction.

Despite their biological importance, most of these enzymes are less well -understood in comparison with homonuclear metalloenzymes, in part due to the inherent complexity from the presence of different metal ions next to each other. Specifically, we seek to investigate why a protein containing a heme -non-heme iron center (as in nitric oxide reductase (NOR)) is effective at 2e-reduction of NO, allowing N -N bond formation, whereas a protein containing a heme -copper center (as in heme -copper oxidase (HCO)) is proficient at 4e- reduction of O 2, enabling O -O bond cleavage, yet a protein containing a heme -Fe4S4center (as in assimilatory sulfite and nitrite reductases (SiR NiR)) is efficient at 6e-reduction of sulfite or nitrite, promoting S -O or N- O bond cleavage, respectively. To achieve this goal, we are designing artificial metalloenzymes that uses stable, easy -to-produce, and well -characterized heme proteins, such as myoglobin and cytochrome c peroxidase, as scaffolds for making structural and functional models of HCO, NOR, SiR and NiR.1Using these models, we are elucidating the roles of heme redox potential, electron transfer rates, and hydrogen bonding in conferring the different enzymatic activities, as well as structural features responsible for fine -tuning the specific and cross reactivities between these enzymes. As a result, we have identified several non -covalent interactions in the secondary coordination sphere, such as the presence of Tyr and water, and associated hydrogen bonding networks, in playing key roles in the activities and in tuning the reduction potentials of metal centers with m inimal effect on the activities.1,2We have also introduced unnatural amino acids and non -native cofactors into the active sites of the models to address issues such as the roles of conserved Tyr and heme redox potential in the enzymatic activities.

KN-18 POMs to Counteract the Effect of Cu(II) - A Interaction in the Context may play a role inAlzheimer's Disease (AD), because they can modulate the aggregation of the amyloid - (A) peptides and can catalyse the formation of Reactive Oxygen Species, two events closely related to the aetiology of pathology [1,2 ]. Hence one therapeutic approach relies on the use of Cu(II) ligands to re move the ion from its interaction with A and lessen associated deleterious effects (ROS and possible stabilization of oligomers regarded as the most toxic species present during t he aggregation of the peptide).[ 2-4]Polyoxometalate (POM) are polyanionic oxoclusters of early transition metal ions which have found applications in various fields from catalysis to material science [5-7]. Controlled basic degradation of POMs can lead to lacunary POMs, which are very efficient all- inorganic ligands [ 8], making them interesting candidates for chelating Cu(II) out of A. In addition, POMs can modulate the aggregation of amyloidogenic peptides, including A [ 9] due to electrostatic interactions with positively charged amino -acid residues. The double ability of two Keggin- type POMs ,K4[-SiW 12O40] on Cu -induced aggregation of A (see figure below) and ROS production will be shown. In addition, the influence of metal -substituted counterparts, KM(M = d -block ions) on the apo- Aaggregation will be briefly commented on.

At the same time, intracellular copper levels are tightly controlled by an intricate network of transport and storage proteins , which bind copper with subfem tomolar dissociation constants [1]. To explore the dynamics of this kinetically labile yet thermodynamically tightly buffered pool, we developed asuite of ligands and probes that selectively bind to monovalent Cu(I), the prevalent oxidation state of coppe r within the reducing cellular environment. Built upon phosphine sul fide stabilized phosphine (PSP) donor motifs, the ligands are remarkably resistant towards oxidation and exhibit exceptional as Zn(II), Fe(II), [2].Biological studies with the high -affinity ligand PSP-2 revealed rapid cellular uptake and demonstrated effective suppress ion of copper -dependent processes such as the copper -induced trafficking of the Menkes protein (ATP7A) or long- term potentiation of neurons in mouse hippocampal brain tissue. I ntegration of the PSP ligand motif into a donor -acceptor substituted fluorophore archi tecture yielded an emission -ratiometric probe, [3]. live mouse fibroblasts revealed rapid changes in cellular Cu(I) availability upon incubation with the membrane grown in basal orcopper -supplemented medium, the probe assumed only a low fraction al saturation despite substantial differences in total copper ,thus indicating tight buffering at low attomolar levels , likely involving a polydisperse buffer dominated by thiol-containing ligands .

Rosenzweig1 1Department sof Molecular Biosciences and of Chemistry, Northwestern University ,Evanston, Illinois 60208, USA .amyr@northwestern.edu Methanotrophic bacteria oxidize methane to methanol in the first step of their metabolic pathway. Whereas current catalysts that can selectively activate the 105 kcal mol-1C-H bond in methane require high temperatures and pressures, methanotrophs perform this chemistry under ambient conditions using methane monooxygenase (MMO) enzymes. In most methanotrophs, this chemically challenging reaction is catalyzed by particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO), a copper -dependent, integral enzyme. of three subunits, PmoB, and PmoC, arranged in a trimeric complex [1]. Despite extensive research and the availability of multiple crystal structures, the location and nature of the pMMO copper active site remain controversial. Studi es are further complicated by issues with retaining enzymatic activity upon detergent solubilization and purification. Reconstitution of pMMO into bicelles ,which mimic the membrane environment, recovers methane oxidation activity , indicating that activity loss is not caused by the removal of catalytic copper ions [2].Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic data acquired on cells of Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) show that the same copper centers are present in vivo and in the isolated pMMO. Moreover, biochemical and advanced EPR characterization ismost consistent with the presence of two monocopper sites in pMMO, one in the soluble region of the PmoB subunit and one in the membrane in nanodiscs also indicates that PmoB and PmoC each contain a single copper ion [4]. Taken together, these studies provide new insight into the nature and location of the active site. References [1]Sirajuddin, S. & Rosenzweig, A. C. Enzymatic oxidation of methane.

This is exemplified by the well -known Rieske centers in which His ligands enable proton coupled electron transfer, leading to unusually positive and pH -dependent redox -potentials. While synthetic analogues with homoleptically coordinated cores are well established in bioinorganic chemistry [2], full characterization of their reduced forms as well as high fidelity synthetic analogues that emulate heteroleptic {N xSy} coordination as found in the Rieske proteins have been reported only recently [3,4]. In this lecture the effect of protonation on redox potentials, electronic structures and spectroscopic features of the [2Fe- 2S] core will be presented, and details of the proton - assisted electron transfer mechanism for first high fidelity synthetic analogues of Rieske centers (see Figure left) , the mitochondrial mitoNEET cluster (see Figure right) and related systems will be discussed .

Currently, im munotherapy with checkpoint inhibitor antibodies is revolutionizing clinical oncology even allowing cure of highly aggressive cancer types like melanoma and lung cancer. However, response to these immunotherapies is restricted to patient subgroups and curr ently conclusive predictive biomarkers are not available. Classically, a nticancer metal drugs areconsidered to target predominantly nucleic acids, hence killing cancer cells by inducing genomic damage and apoptotic cell death . However, during the last years it became clear that metal drugs are not pure cytotoxic agents, but might also strongly interact with the fidelity of anticancer immune responses . Central underlying mechanisms include upregulati on of cancer cell immunogenicity or depletion of regulatory immune cell compartments1.As one example , we have found that an intraperitoneal colon cancer model can be cured when combining oxaliplatin with bacterial ghosts as adjuvants2. Bacterial ghosts are empty envelopes of gram -negative bact eria with a distinct immune -stimulatory potential. In contrast, oxaliplatin alone only retarded tumor growth. Interestingly, animals cured by this immunochemotherapy approach were vaccinated against the original cancer cells making regrowth of the tumor gr aft impossible. As this vaccination effect was entirely depending on the presence of activated T cells ,induction of an immunogenic cell death by oxaliplatin supported by innate immune activation via the adjuvant can be anticipated .This hypothesis was pro ven be induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, calreticulin cell surface exposure, as well as HMGB1 and ATP release be the combination -treated cancer cells. A platinum(IV) prodrug of oxaliplatin targeted for tumor -specific activation based on album in binding was able to cure CT26 murine colon cancer even without additional adjuvant in immunocompetent but not sever ecombined immunodeficient (SCID) mice3.Comparable observations regarding the upregulation of danger -associated pattern release were also made for the anticancer ruthenium compound KP1339. Accordingly, massive induction of ER stress and caspase 8 -mediated apoptosis were detected in KP1339 - hypersensitive human colon cancer cells4. This anticancer activity was mediated at least in part by KP1339 interference with the central protein chaperon GRP78 in the ER. Th ese preclinical data will be discussed in the light of recent clinical approval sof platinum -based chemotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors as first line therapy of lung cancer .

China . hsun@hku.hk Metallodrugs have been widely used as either diagnostic or therapeutic agents. It is crucial to understand their me chanisms of action to advance drug design. To achieve this, an integrative approach is required due to the complexity of metal -biomolecule interactions. Bismuth drugs in combination with antibiotics have been used in clinic for decades for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori ) infection including antibiotic resistance strains. We developed a system pharmacology and metalloproteomics approaches consisting of continuous -flow gel electrophoresis and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, LA -ICP-MS, IMAC and fluorescence to identify metal -associated proteins in cells using bismuth drugs as an example ( 1-3). The knowledge acquired by these studies enables UreG to be discovered as a new target for the development of urease (4). We have also foun d that Bi(III) selectively interfere with Zn(II) biochemistry in pathogens (5). Infections caused by e.g., New Delhi metallo -- lactamase 1(NDM- 1) producing bacteria are extremely difficult to treat (4). We show that colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS), and related Bi(III) compounds irreversibly inhibit different types of MBLs via the metal displacement mechanism with one Bi(III) displacing two Zn(II) ions. CBS restores meropenem (MER) efficacy against MBL -positive bacteria in vitro, and in animal i nfection models (6 ). Therefore, bismuth drugs could be repurposed together with clinically used antibiotics as co- therapy to cope with current antimicrobial resistance crisis. We anticipate that the methodologies described are generally applicable for understanding the (patho)physiological roles of metals/metallodrugs. Our mechanism -guided discovery of new druggable targets as well as new medicinal applications of bismuth drugs may eventually lead to the development of new effective ther apeutics.

The water oxidation proceeds through four sequential steps via the Si -state cycle (Si, i = 0 -4). We have solved the structure of the Mn 4CaO 5-cluster by both synchrotron radiation -ray free electron lasers (XFEL) [2]at atomic resolutions. These studies revealed a \"distorted\" chair form of the catalytic center and detailed arrangement of each atoms, inter -atomic distances within the Mn 4CaO 5-cluster, in its dark -stable S 1-state. In order to fully uncover the reaction mechanism of water oxidation, it is necessary to solve the structures of the catalyst in its intermediate S - states. To this end, we used a pump -probe approach with a combination of \"small\" PSII crystals and femtosecond X -ray crystallography (SFX) using the femtosecond XFELs, to solve the structures of the intermediate S- states. We have reported the structure of 2 -flashes induced S 3-state [3]in which, a new oxygen designated O6, was found to be inse rted in a position close to O5, a unique oxo -bridged oxygen already present in the S 1-state, resulting a Mn 4CaO 6-cluster in the S 3-state. Our results suggested the possible formation of O=O bond between O5 and O6. Due to the limited resolution, however, th ere are still uncertainties regarding the distance between O5 and O6, and thus the exact species of O5 -O6 and the mechanism of O=O bond formation were still unclear. We have improved the resolution of the intermediate S 3-state structure, and also solved th e 1-flash induced S 2-state structure. Based on these results, the molecular mechanism for O=O bond formation has now become clear.

Nanoconfinement is now mimicked in bio -inspired catalytic investigations in which two (or more) enzymes are confined within the nanopores (10- 100 nm) of a conducting metal oxide layer - one that is quickly and easily deposited to multi -micron depth on a suitable support, such as titanium foil.1One of the enzymes is a photosynthetic flavoenzyme ('FNR' = which using electrons supplied to/from the electrode at a control centre.

K\u00fcpper1 1School of Biological Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Cruickshank Bldg, St. Machar Drive, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland, UK. fkuepper@abdn.ac.uk Brown algae of the Laminariales (kelps) are the strongest accumulators of iodine among living organisms. They r epresent a major pump in the global biogeochemical cycle of iodine and in particular, the major source of iodocarbons in the coastal atmosphere. Nevertheless, the chemical state and biological significance of accumulated iodine have remained unknown. Elucidation of these questions was the objective of this study. Using an interdisciplinary array of techniques, chiefly relying on synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we show that the accumulated form is iodide, which readily scavenges a variety of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We propose here that its biological role is that of an inorganic antioxidant, the first ever to be described in a living system. Upon oxidative stress, iodide is effluxed. On the thallus the apoplast, iodide detoxifies both aqueous oxidants and ozone, the latter resulting in the release of high levels of molecular iodine and consequent formation of hygroscopic iodine oxides leading to particles, which are precursors to cloud condensation nuclei. When kelp thalli are submerged, this process impacts iodine speciation in seawater [1].In several aspects, iodide is unique as a biological antioxidant. Among the halides, it has by far the best antioxidant properties; yet, bromide complements it for the detoxification of superoxide [2].This paper will also report on the latest tomograp hy-based findings concerning the subcellular localization of iodine in cells, with implications for its mechanism of uptake, storage and efflux.

Drug resistance is a major health challenge with antimicrobial resistance in particular threatening the very core of modern medicine globally. Cancer drug resistance is fast emerging as another serious threat. The ability to fine -tune the properties of metal complexes has led to the advancement of metallodrugs with wide ranging biomedical applications. While many of these are highly effective, resistance to these metallotherapies is fast becoming a major limitation associated with their use. There is therefore an urgent need to rationally design and develop innovative therapeutics that can overcome drug resistance. With a deeper understanding of cancer at a molecular level, a number of stra tegies are emerging to overcome drug resistance. These include the exploitation of nanotechnologies for the selective delivery of drugs (e.g. platinum drugs) to tumour cells [1] and the development of multi -functional drugs. [1-2]Our drug design strategy to overcome drug resista nce has focused to date on targeting multiple orthogonal biological pathways and, in doing so, block the development of multiple intracellular escape mechanisms essential for tumor survival. With this in mind, we have developed a series of multi -modal plat inum, ruthenium and copper complexes , all of which have shown potential to overcome drug resistance. [3-8] The majority of these complexes incorporate clinical used drugs or derivatives thereof as ligands. [9] While some were originally intended to targ et ca ncer-resista nt tumours only, others were designed to specifically address antibiotic resistance . Other complexes that have been developed offer the potential to act as prophylactic metallo -antibiotics possessing potent anti -cancer and anti -microbial properties. [8,10] A summary of our drug design strategies, our metallodrug candidates and their respective biological properties will be presented.

Class I RNR:s employ protein R2 to generate and store an essential catalytic radical. Over half a century ago it was discovered that protein R2 from E. coli require snon-heme iron for function. Since then, it has been established that the radical is generated by a dinuclear metal site in an oxygen dependent reaction [1,2] . Notably, a number of variants of the metal site has been found in different organisms, likely because of adaptations to the metal availability in different growth environments. The metal site can be di -iron (class Ia), di -manganese (class Ib), o r heterodinuclear Mn/Fe (class Ic) [1,2] . Classes Ia and Ib generate a stable tyrosyl radical while class Ic forms a radical -equivalent MnIV/FeIIIhigh- valent oxidation state of the metal site [3,4] . Class Id, containing a MnIV/MnIIIcofactor, was also recently proposed [5 -7]. The metal sites in class es Ia and Ic perform direct oxygen activation while class Ib requires a flavoprotein, NrdI, to generate superoxide that oxidizes the di -manganese site [8 -10]. Recently a new group of metal -free RNR proteins was discovered i n several human pathogens [11,12] . Organisms encoding this type of RNR are involved in e.g. diseases of the respiratory, urinary and genital tracts and it potentially developed in response nutritional immunity providing extreme metal restriction. In this group, the R2 protein initiates catalysis usin g a metal -independent DOPA radical residing on a post -translationally modified tyrosyl residue.

Biomineralization studies typically focus on the mediation function of organic matrices on inorganic minerals, which helps scientist s to design and synthesize bioinspired functional materials. It has been demonstrated that the repair of hard tissues such as bones and teeth can be improved by using biomimetic mineralization. However, the presence of inorganic minerals may also alter the native behaviours of biological organisms and in nature, biomineralization plays a key role in promoting organism evolution. Accordingly, it represents a new tactic that scientists can utilize to improve biological organisms with functional materials. Typ ical achievements in this newly emerging research area include biomineralized vaccines, which are \"thermostable vaccines that do not need refrigeration\", and biomineralized algae for the biological photosynthesis of hydrogen. Besides, the inorganic mineral phase produced by target cell calcification can be used as an alternative drug -free chemotherapy of cancers. These achievements imply the great potentials of biomimetic mineralization in the biological and medical applications as well as represent the successful biological functionalization by using inorganic materials. We believe the rapid development of biomineralization studies can enrich our current understanding about biological inorganic chemistry.

KN-32 Proteins in the Mechanism of Metallodrugs Yangzhong Liu1 1Department of Chemistry, University of Science and Technology of China, 96 Jinzhai Road, Hefei 230026, China. Metallodrugs, such as c isplatin , are widely used in clinic for cancer chemotherapy .It is well -known that DNA is the drug target of platinum antitumor agents; however, only small portion of intracellular platinum binds to DNA. Proteins are found to play important roles in the drug uptake, DNA repair and drug efflux, thus det ermine the drug efficacy and resistance. Sulfur containing proteins are kinetically more favorable than DNA in the reaction to platinum drugs. Copper proteins are highly reactive to cisplatin since Cu(I) and Pt(II) have similar binding preference in coordi nation chemistry. The copper transport protein Ctr1 has been found to facilitate the cellular uptake of cisplatin. P latinum could transfer from Ctr1 via Atox1 to ATPase. This result confirmed that the proteins associated with the cellular homeostasis of co pper could also be involved in metabolic pathway of cisplatin in the view of chemistry. As copper proteins are involved in the mechanism of platinum drugs, we analyzed the effect of anti - copper agents on the reaction of copper proteins with cisplatin . Tetr athiomolybdate (TM) is used in the clinic for the treatment of Wilson's disease , which is associated with the dysfunction of Wilson's disease protein (WLN , acopper efflux protein ). Interestingly, both TM and WLN are associated with the efficacy of cisplatin .We found that TM induces dimerization of the metal -binding domain of WLN4 through a unique sulfur -bridged Mo 2S6O2cluster. TM expels copper ions from Cu -WLN4 and forms a copper -free dimer. The binding of Mo to cysteine resi dues of WLN4 inhibits platination of the protein. Reaction with multi -domain proteins indicates that TM can also connect two domains in the same molecule, forming Mo-bridged intramolecular crosslinks. These results provide structural and chemical insight h owTM attenuates the cisplatin resistance mediated by copper efflux proteins. In addition to platinum drugs, a rsenic and ruthenium agents also demonstrate great therapeutic effects in anticancer therapy. We found that z inc-finger proteins (ZFPs) are highly reactiv e to metallodrugs . different metallo -agents demonstrated different selectivity to various ZFPs, which could be associated their different therapeutic activities. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is an effective drug used for the treatment of A PL; we found that ATO preferentially binds to PML, the drug target of APL. NAMI -A inhibits tumor metastasis; we found that NAMI -Ademonstrates higher binding affinity to Sp1, a transcription factor associated with tumor metastasis. The selectivity of NAMI -A is rather different from other metallodrugs on various ZFPs. These findings suggest that the selectivity of metallodrugs is crucial fortheir therapeutic potency.

Le Brun1 1Centre for Molecular and Structural Biochemistry, School of Chemistry, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, NR4 7TJ ,UK. Iron-sulfur cluster proteins carry out multiple functions, including as regulators of gene transcription/translation in response to environmental stimuli [1]. In all known cases, the cluster acts as the sensory module, where the inherent reactivity/fragility of iron -sulfur clusters with small/redox active molecules is exploited to effect conformational changes that modulate binding to DNA regulatory sequences. This promotes an often substantial re -programming of the cellular proteome that enables the organism or cell to adapt to, or counteract, its changing circumstances. Here, I will discuss recent progress in the structural and mechanistic characterization of iron-sulfur cluster regulators, focussing on NsrR, RirA and WhiB -like proteins that are involved in sensing e.g. nitric oxide, iron and molecular oxygen in bacteria. In recent years, we have developed the use of mass spectrometry under conditions where i ron-sulfur proteins remain folded and the cluster bound [2, 3] ; aspects of this work , including time-resolved studies, will be discussed .

Its hydrolysis of urea to ammonia is essential to the survival of Helicobacter pylori in acidic human stomach. As nickel is a competitive ion at the top of the Irving -Williams series, one way to ensure correct metallation of urease is through specific protein -protein interactions among metallochaperones along the nickel delivery pathway, which is assisted by four accessory protein s, UreE, UreF, UreG and UreD(H). We have been combining structure determination, mutagenesis and biochemical analysis to understand the urease maturation pathway [1- 3]. Our work demonstrated a paradigm on how a me tallochaperone UreG couples GTP hydrolysis to allosterically regulate the binding/release of nickel ions and the switching of protein -binding partners, thus providing a mechanism where nickel ions are delivered to the urease without releasing the \"free\" to xic metal to the cytoplasm.

If we can visualize a molecule in action, it is possible to acquire biological information, which is unavailable if we deal with cell homogenates. One possible approach is to design and synthesize chemical probes that can convert biological information to chemical output. In this talk, molecular design strategies for MR and fluorescence imaging probes are introduced. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is an imaging technique using nuclear magnetic resonance phenomenon. MRI has been clinically used since it yields highly spatial resolution images of deep regions in living animal bodies. A novel 19F MRI contrast agent, fluorine accumulated silica nanoparticle for MRI contrast enhancement (FLAME) is developed, which is composed of a per fluorocarbon core and a robust silica shell. FLAME has advantages such as high sensitivity, stability, modification of the surface, and biocompatibility. The activatable derivative of FLAME will also be introduced .[1],[2],[3],[4] Intravital imaging by two -photon excitation microscopy (TPEM) has been widely utilized to visualize cell functions.

We have developed different molecular designs based on luminescent metal complexes for biomolecular labeling and surface active groups for attachment to gold surfaces. Gold nanoparticles, AuNP, offer a unique opportunity to incorporate multiple molecular luminescent complexes into a single nanoprobe architecture for signal detection without engaging in lengthy synthetic procedures for the incorporation of multiple labels. Nanoprobes are also ideal as spatially localized cellular probes that can be detected with different imaging modalities. We have employed AuNPs as a scaffold for luminescent coordination complexes so that the nanoprobes bear the distinct optical signature of the luminescent agent, ind ependent of the properties of the particle.

Chemistry and the Design of Anticancer Agents with Non -Classic al Modes of Action Christian G. Hartinger1 1School of Chemi cal Sciences , University of Auckland, 23 Symonds Street, Auckland 1010, New Zealand. c.hartinger @auckland.ac.nz Resistance of tumors to chemotherapeutics , intrinsic or acquired, is a major limitation in the treatment of cancer patients. To overcome drug resistance, compounds with novel modes of action are required. This represents a major opportunity for metal -based compound design with their unique chemistry and properties very different to organic molecules. The reactivity of labile metal complexes to biological nucleophiles may limit to some extent their design to specifically target a single protein, but may be an advantage as more than one pathway could be affected in cancer cells. In our research, we aim to develop organometallic anticancer agents by using design strategies based on for example polynuclear complexes and multitargeted structures that often feature bioactive ligand systems to harvest a synergistic effect between the metal center and the ligand or allow for selective delivery to tumor tissue [ 1,2]. By developing new bioanalytical methods, we aim to improve our understanding of the fat e of metal -based anticancer agents in a biological environment, especially at the molecular level. In this lecture, I will present our recent work on organometallic anticancer, with a particular focus on the introduction of novel ligand structures, the preparation of the ir organometallic complexes, and studies on their reactions with biomolecules [3-5]. The impact of the nature of the ligands on the biological properties of the organometallic anticancer agents will be discussed. This will be complemented by data collected through the application of bioanalytical methods based on separation techniques coupled to mass spectrometry in the analysis of metal complexes in complex matrices , which helps us to gain a deeper understanding of their modes of action and the impact of the nature of the complex on the bioactivity.

Petering1, Mohammad Karim1,Susan Krezoski1, Eric Lund1,Afsana Mahim1 Biochemistry, of Wisconsin -Milwaukee, 3210 N. Cramer, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53201 USA. petering@uwm.edu As many as 3,000 mammalian proteins utilize Zn2+as a structural or functional cofactor. Others interact with Zn2+during signaling processes. Along with iron deficiency, deficits in dietary zinc constitute a critical nutritional problem for as many as 1.5 billion people worldwide, resulting in widespread, significant health problems. Much has been learned about the organismic and cellular trafficking of zinc, particularly the key role of ZIP and ZnT transporters in controlling access of Zn2+to cells and intracellular compartments [1]. Much less is known about mechanisms of Zn2+migration within cells and organelles. Because so many Zn -proteins exist, it is difficult to imagine specific chaperone - dependent pathways that direct the insertion of Zn2+into each apo -Zn-protein. An alternative hypothesis proposes that the cell's buffer for Zn2+, comp rised of a plethora protein and small molecule Zn2+binding ligands, supplies the metal ion for the constitution of Zn -proteins. Components of the zinc buffer include proteomic binding sites, particularly metallothionein (MT), and possibly small molecules such as glutathione (GSH). T he cellular dynamics of MT -bound Zn2+suggest that it participates in basal Zn2+trafficking d espite its large affinity for MT (K ~ 1011-12)[2]. But MT -null cells also successfully transfer Zn2+to its functional binding sites. Thus, the participation of other proteomic and small molecule ligands in Zn2+trafficking is required. Based on the use of zinc fluorescent probes and apo- carbonic anhydrase (apo -CA) as monitors of Zn2+binding within the proteome, it is clear that the intracellular ligand environment strongly binds Zn2+(K ~ 1010) and, consequently, that the 'free'Zn2+concentrati on falls into the nM -pM range. In this context, direct li gand substitution mechanisms are hypothesized to med iateZn-protein constitution and reversible regulatory protein (e.g. MTF -1) activation. To assess the plausibility of this hypothesis, p roperties of the reconstitution of apo - CA with Zn2+from the zinc -buffer , including MT and GSH, will be described. Appli cation of this model to important pathological states , including zinc deficiency and Cd2+toxicity , will be considered [3] .

The reaction occurs at an intricate, bimetallic center composed of nickel and iron ions coordinated to both protein and non- protein ligands [1]. Biosynthesis of this metalloenzyme requires the cooperative activity of a team of accessory proteins that gather the indiv idual components and assemble the metallocenter in the active site of the precursor protein [2]. Our studies are focused on the delivery of nickel, which is the final component inserted into the hydrogenase active site. T wo of the key metallochaperones required for nickel delivery totheE. coli hydrogenase 3 precursor protein are HypA and the GTPase HypB. We use a combination of spectroscopic, biochemical, and microbiology methods to examine the activities of the separate proteins and how they impact each other. The metal complexes of both proteins have been extensively characterized, and analysis of nickel in the conte xt of protein complexes provided detailed information about how the metal moves between the proteins. In addition, o ur results indicate that the GTPase cycle of HypB controls unidirectional and nickel -selective transfer between the proteins primarily by modulating the interaction with HypA .Furthermore , the development and application of a high - throughput hydrogenase assay identified a new component of nickel homeostasis in E. coli .Altogether, the results outline a metal -selective pathway for nickel as it moves through the cell to reach the end destination at the active site of the [NiFe] -hydrogenase enzyme.

In these artificial base pairs, metal ions formally replace the hydrogen bonds between complementary nucleobases. In the past decade, several metal -mediated base pairs have been reported [1]. Most metal - mediated base pairs devised by our group contain silver(I) ions. To widen the scope of metal -mediated base pairing, we recently extended our studies towards metal -mediated base pairs bearing metal ions other than silver(I). Here we are reporting the development of new metal -mediated base applied for the incorporation of copper(I), mercury(II) and zinc(II) into DNA duplexes. Depending on the experimental conditions, a certain selectivity for these metal ions was achieved. The copper(I) -mediated base pair is the first of its kind [2]. The mercury(II)- mediated base pair forms selectively also in the presence of silver(I), so it was used for the concomitant site -specific incorporation of silver(I) and mercury(II) into the same DNA duplex [5]. Moreover , monoanionic ligands such as 4 - carboxyimidazole were used for the binding of copper(II) ions [3].As a variety of applications have been proposed for metal -containing nucleic acids, including DNA -templated metal nanoclusters [7], th specific incorporation of a defined number of distin ct me tal ions is of high importance.

It is becoming increasingly apparent that temporal fluctuations in the zinc metallome, as well as changes in labile zinc concentrations in subcellular compartments, play regulatory roles in gametes across many species. Management of the cel lular metallome involves specific metalloregulatory proteins that sense metals and regulate discrete processes like transcription, translation and cell division. Here we show how zinc occupancy in some of these factors mediates a diverse array of cellular decisions including the decision of the egg to enter the cell cycle at the time of fertilization. Using protein biochemistry, zinc- protein thermodynamics, single cell quantitative X -ray and small molecule fluorescence microscopy, we show that the egg, must undergo dramatic translocation of zinc, loading and unloading of metalloregulatory proteins and finally exocytosis of zinc in short time frames to ensure successful fertilization. In this talk, zinc fluxes in the sperm will also be delineated and compared with those that occur in the egg at the time of fertilization in events known as 'zinc sparks .' Reference [1]E.L.

Transporters and chaperons are responsible to bring the Cu to their target, mostly Cu -enzymes. However, Cu could bind to off -target molecules in case of failure of Cu -homeostasis, or upon Cu- overload. Cu bound to off -target biomolecules could be toxic, often due to uncontrolled catalysis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. This has been proposed for the peptide amyloid- beta and alpha- synuclein, two proteins that play a key role in Alzhei mer's and Parkinson's disease, respectively. Cu-complexes are also under investigation as potential drugs, like in cancer or as antimicrobials. We are interested in the question of the reactivity of Cu- drugs (Like Cu , particular their redox activity and the production of reactive oxygen species.

We show that MTs together with potent disruptors of GSH can inactivate rapidly inorganic Cu(II) -complexes (like investigated for cancer therapy) and Cu(II)- peptides (e.g. used for artificial nucleases or peptidases), mainly by reducing Cu(II) to Cu(I) and of the Cu(I).

Kroneck1 sulfate to hydrogen sulfide, with sulfite as crucial intermediate, is one of the oldest and most prominent microbial energy conserving pathways on Earth. As life may have originated in hot environments, the occurrences of sulfat e reducing hyperthermophilic archaea and deep - branching thermophilic bacteria indicate an early origin of this process. Isotopic data suggest that dissimilatory sulfate reduction began over 3 billion years ago but acquired global significance only after sulfate concentrations had considerably increased in the Precambrian oceans approximately 2.35 billion years ago. Sulfate -reducing microorganisms are ubiquitous and play an imperative role in the global cycling of carbon and sulfur .Sulfate is an energy -richmolecule, however, that is chemically inert. To use this energy source, microorganisms have to invest ATP. Three enzymes are the key players in the dissimilatory reduction of sulfate to hydrogen sulfide: (i) ATP sulfurylase, (ii) adenosine sulfite reductase. Because of its low redox potential, sulfate cannot be directly reduced by H 2or organic acids, it has to be converted to adenosine 5' - phosphosulfate (APS) in a reaction catalyzed by sulfurylase .Hereby, the redox potential Eo' (APS/AMP + HSO 3-) is shifted to - 60 mV. The formation of APS is endergonic and probably driven by the subsequent hydrolysis of pyrophosphate and the energetically favorable APS reduction. Therefore, the activation of sulfate to APS is assumed to consume two ATP equivalents. APS reductase, a FAD, [4Fe- 4S] enzyme, converts APS to sulfite and AMP, followed by the six -electron reduction of sulfite to hydrogen sulfide as the final (Eo' (HSO -116 mV) [1-3].The final multi process is catalyzed by reductase which contains the coupled siroheme -[4Fe-4S] cofactor at the active site. Recently, a protein -based trisulfide was identified as key intermediate that cou ples the reduction of sulfite to energy conservation [ 4].In my talk structural and mechanistic aspects of dissimilatory reduction of sulfate will be discussed briefly . Furthermore, alternative enzymes will be presented which can reduce sulfite to hydrogen sulfide .

Astrid and I did practically everything together and without her I could not write the following part. Clearly, Icannot summarize here the research of over 55 years --only indications can be given: I had my first encounter with nucleotides and derivatives, making me also famil iar with \"ambivalent\" ligands [2 ], in 1961 during my Ph.D. work with Prof. Dr. Hans Erlenmeyer and PD Dr. Hans Brintzinger (a coworker of Erlenmeyer) at the University of Basel by studying the metal ion -binding properties of 2- aminopyridine N(1) -oxide [ 3], a model compound of adenosine N(1)- oxide (studied by [ 5' -monophosphate N(1) -oxide situation to macrochelate formation whic h occurs with N7 of the adenine residue by the phosphate -bound metal ion (M2+), e.g., in M(AMP) [6], M(ADP)-[7], M(ATP)2-[8]and related complexes giving rise to an intramolecular equilibrium between a closed (macrochelated) and an open isom er [9 ,10].

So, even before elements were as such known and recognized they were already intensely used. No doubt Gold, Silver and Copper were the first of such metals, and these were generally used in jewellery and coins. But in some cases Cu was also in weapons. By the time periodicity in the ordering of the element, initially based on atomic weights, the Periodic System appeared in 1869 . Already at that time one was aware that so me elements and metal -containing compounds were necessary for life ( i.e.Fe). But at the same it was known that other element sarevery toxic, like As, Hg. Already in the ancient times, some of the elements were used to treat diseases, like colloidal gold . The dosage of many of such metallic elements to humans, to cure or prevent diseases has been a subject of study for many decades. In the last 50 years the usage of metal compounds to diagnose or cure diseases has been rapidly grown [1]and has been a rep eating main theme at almost all ICBICs. The history of the discovery of metals as trace element, drugs and diagnostics will be briefly described, with a focus on some of our own work [2,3] . 3144. 74 75 ICBIC-19 ICBIC-19Lifelong Achievements Talks Lifelong Achievements Talks Book of Abstracts Book of AbstractsLA-05 What could be F ascinating in M etallopeptides co.

Study of metallo -peptides either as metallo -peptides or as models of larger metalloproteins is a huge area of research. Having hundreds of papers in this field is a simple output of many years of more or less reasonable work. Selecting from all these set of data by the author(s) something which could be of some interest for others is rather hopeless and subjective work , especially when author(s) usually ends his (their) interest when paper is published. Collaboration with many, many different researchers is very exciting, but it is hard to remember all contributions -that is why the selection made in this very short talk will be based on rather accidental criteria. I may propose based on various feelings the following topics: 1.Neurodegeneration mostly based on the studies on prion proteins and copper [1] 2.His tags and their unusual behaviour in the presence of metal ions [2] 3.Metallophores and possible approach to ba cteria resistance [3] All these topics allowed to work with fantastic researchers and to get invitation to this meeting.

Valensin !348 Louvain- la-Neuve, Belgium Because of its potential to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton reaction , 'free 'Fe2+must be carefully controlled in living systems . In many unicellular and multicellular organisms ,ferritin plays this role, [1]via its ferritin 'sstructural relative, the Dps protein [2], ubiquitously present in the bacterial and archaeal kingdoms ,functions both as an iron scaveng erand mechanical protect orof DNA .In addition to their ferroxidase centres, b oth ferritin sand Dps proteins also utilize acidic residues located on the inner surface of their protein shells to carry out biomineralization via nucleation of iron to generate iron oxide nanoparticles [1, 3]. However, there are organisms which do not contain ferritin genes intheir genome s and so we may ask how they protect against iron toxicity, and how they store i ron. Early studies indicated that in Saccharomyces cerevisiea i ron could be stored in ,and mobilized from ,intracellular vacuoles [4]. Recently a new type of protein organelle composed of encapsulin nanocompartments has been described which stores iron and protects bacteria from oxidative stress [ 5]. These nanocompartments are widely distributed in both bacterial and archaeal genomes [ 6], are able to encapsulate specific ferritin -like cargo proteins attached to their inner surface, have dens e iron -rich cores and functionally resemble ferritins, but with a much greater capacity (30,000 iron atoms) to store iron than ferritins. We will compare these ferritin -like proteins with both ferritins and Dps proteins with regard to their ferroxidase activity and their mode of biomineralization. References [1] R.

Carbonate anion radicals, CO 3.-, are known to be formed via the hemolysis of ONOOCO 2-. Thi s is commonly given as the explanation of the toxicity of O 2.-. Furthermore, CO 3.-is formed during the enzymatic activity of Cu,Zn- superoxide dismutase and xanthine oxidase. Recent results point out that CO 3.- is also formed by the Fenton reaction in the presence of bicarbonate, even at concentrations lower than those present in biological systems. (It should be noted that the reaction Fe(H 2O)62++ H 2O2in neutral solutions yields FeIV=O aqand not OH.radicals. ) Even in the presence of citrate the Fenton reaction does not yield OH.radicals, and when bicarbonate is present the product is CO 3.-. Thus one has to consider CO 3.-as the source of oxidative stress. As CO 3.-are considerably less reactive than OH.and have a considerably longer lifetime they are expected to be more selective in their reactions in biological systems and be more harmf ul. LA-08 Modelling a common strategy in chemistry and biochemistry to apply structural and/or functional models in order to understand a novel discovery in more detail. Bioinorganic Chemistry is no exception in this respect. When interactions between metal ions and metal coordination compounds with nucleic acids got into the focus of scientists during the past century, the use of truncated systems, hence of isolated nucleobases or short fragments of the large DNA and RNA molecules with their sometimes complicated tertiary structures, proved distinctly advantageous. These s imple models were instrumental in identifying relevant metal binding sites of the common and rare nucleobases and were essential in establishing fundamental aspects of the effects of metal coordination on properties such as acid -base chemistry, tautomerism , and hydrogen bonding. On the other hand, the use of isolated nucleobases rather than large oligomers has distinct limitations in that it can not provide insight into the importance of neighboring bases and sequence specificity in general, and necessarily fails in establishing potentially crucial secondary interactions. The use of sophisticated spectroscopic techniques, modern X - ray crystallography, as well as computational methods has meanwhile overcome many shortcomings of the \"simple\" models. The lecture will focus on findings made in the author's laboratory over the p ast four decades and critically examine results which may or may not be of immediat e biological relevance, but add to our general understanding of the chemistry of metal species with the heterocyclic nucleobases [1, 2], including topical areas such as Supramolecular Chemistry and Nanotechnology involving nucleic acids or their components and metals .

Microorganisms solve this problem via low molecular mass high -affinity iron(III) chelators, siderophors, produced u are common bidentate chelating groups found in many siderophores, such as in the well -known desferrioxamine B (DFB). These molecules form extremely high stability water -soluble iron(III) complexes and transport this metal to the cells in this form , are able to oxidize even the iron(II) to iron(III) [2]. Although, the high selectivity of the siderophore -based microbial chelators to bind iron works well , siderophores have the ability to bind a variety of metals in addition to iron . The high selectivity for iron(III) is determined significantly , but not exclusively by the very high thermodynamic stability of the iron(III)- siderophore complexes. However, t here are numerous additional factors, which affect the interaction of siderophores with metal ions and, as a consequence, determine their relative metal ion preferences under certain conditions. Also t hese factors might provide us some tools for tuning the order of preferences. During the past few decades in the Bioinorganic Group in Debrecen , some of the factors , e.g effects of structural elements of siderophores , geometry and kinetic al behaviour of the formed complex es, existence of competitive processes (like protonation, hydroly sis) have been investigated and a few interesting results are planned to demonstrate at the conference [3-6]. Out of the siderophores desferrioxamine B (DFB) , desferricoprogen (DFC) as and analogous compounds, desferricrocin (DFR) and triacetylfusarinine C (TAF) , respectively, will be mentioned. Regarding the metal ions, in addition to iron(II/III), the following metals will be in the focus of the presentation: molybdenum(VI), copper(II), lead(II) and cobalt(III). Very interesting stability of a kinetically inert cobalt(III)- siderophore complex is higher with ca. 5 -7 orders of magnit ude than that with iron(III). The question arises whether a possible interference between the iron versus cobalt uptake could lead to the development of potential drug for the treatment of some microbial infections relying on a 'Trojan horse' strategy ?

For small metal complexes, s olution chemical studies on mixed ligand Cu(II) complexes with aromatic amino acids and aromatic diimine ligands such as 1,10 - phenanthroline have established that the stacking interaction between the side chain aromatic ring andthe diimine stabilizes the complexes and that the indole ring of tryptophan has ahigh complex stabilizing effect [2-4]. It was also shown that the indole ring prefers stacking with -richphenolate ligand [1,5]. Aninteresting case of aromatic ring stacking interactions in the metal center of enzymes is the stacking of the Cu(II)- phenoxyl radical with the vicinal form of galactose oxidase (GO) [6,7] .Although the radical stabilizing effect of the interaction has long been recognized, relevant chemical details have remained largely unclarified. Recent structural and spectral studies have shown that the indole ring incorporated into the side chain of the Cu(II) complex of a salen - type diphenolate ligand as aGO active site model is involved in thestack ing interaction with the Cu(II)- phenoxyl radical moiety upon one -electron oxidation and stabilizes the radical [8,9].Theresults revealed the details of the stacking interaction and its effect on the radical stability, demonstrating that the wea k interactions between the metal center and itsenvironment are essential for the function of metalloenzymes .

It was suggested in previous studies (Spolitak, T. ; Dawson, J.H.; Ballou, D.P. J. Biol. Chem. is an acylperoxo -ferric heme adduct that subsequently undergoes O -O bond cleavage with release of the substituted benzoic acid to generate Compound I. Singular value decomposition analysis of the RSSF data for the formation of this intermediate shows that the energy of its Soret absorption peak is sensitive to the electron donor propert ies of the aryl substituents. A linear Hammett correlation plot is seen for the energy of the Soret peak vs. the Hammett constant. This correlation with the nature of the substituents requires that those substituents remain as part of the ligand bound to the heme iron, providing direct evidence that this adduct is indeed a ferric acylperoxo derivative. Further support for this conclusion derives from additional linear Hammett correlation plots for both the rate of formation of the intermediate as well as for its conversion to Compound I. Clearly, the electron donating/withdrawing properties of the substituents affect the donor properties of the binding substrate, changing the observed rate of formation for the acylperoxo intermediate, as well as the p ropensity and stability of the substituted benzoic acid to serve as the leaving group during O -O bond cleavage yielding Compound I. The ability to directly follow the O -O bond cleavage step in the formation of Compound I from peracids provides a model for how this key step occurs in both P450 enzymes as well as in peroxidases.

[ GM26730]LA-12 Metal Binding to Nucleic Acids - A Journey from the B eginning Einar Sletten1 1Department of Chemistry, University of Bergen, Norway In the late 1960 -ies research on the chemistry of metals in biological systems was mostly focused on amin o acids, peptides and proteins. In contrast, the potential role of metal ions in genetic processes attracted less attention. At the time it w as commonly accepted that the nucleic acids bind metal ions exclusively at the phosphate groups. However, heterocyclic nucleo -bases, purine and pyrimidine rings , constitute an interesting group of ligands. In 1967 the first X -ray structure of a metal bonded purine base was published [1], followed by a series of metal- nucleo -base structures ,including a me tal-nucleotide complex (Cu- GMP) which formed an interesting, inverted double helix [2]. The rapid development of automatic synthesis of DNA- sequences and two -dimensional (2D) high- field NMR in the1980- ies made it possible to determine the conformation o f DNA -oligomers in solution . A main topic was to elucidate sequence -selective binding of metal ions to DNA -duplexes [3,4]. The dramatic improvement in NMR sensitivity due to the development of high- field cryo -magnets enabled us to study not only structures but also kinetics .Rate constants were determined for reactions between metal ions and double -helical Increasing evidence indicates that sulfur- containing proteins ca n play important roles in the activity of platinum antica ncer drugs. The DNA platination rate was substantially enhanced by methionine (Met) binding, suggesting that the thioether could serve as a catalyst [6 ]. Mercury is regarded as the villain element in biological systems. NM R studies on mercury binding to oligonucleo tides for duplex DNA oligomers were carried out using one -and two -dimensional 1H NMR spectra based on nat ural abundance correlation spectroscopy [7]. PS presently I am engaged in a curious environmental probl em: How to remove 67 tons of elemental mercury located in a wreck close to the Norwegian coastline. Supramolecular metal complex - DNA interactions. Having explored the binding of mono -nuclear metal complexes to DNA we moved on to investigate more c omplex systems as part of an EU project coordinated by Mike Hannon, University of Birmingham . The interactions between a supramolecular di - iron metal complex and a dodecamer , [5\u00b4-d(TATGGTACCATA)] 2turned out to be quit e unexpected and spectacular [8 ].

Ward1, Ben Tilley, David Dexter, Steve Gentleman, Antonio Martin -Bastida 1Department of Brain Sciences, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, Du Cane Road, London W12 0NN, UK. The role played by iron in the aetiology and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear. In these present studies, in vivo, post -mortem and in vitro studies investigated the connection between iron and inflammation in PD. Early stage PD subjects showed changes in sys temic ferritin which associated with a variety of inflammatory plasma markers, ie. hepcidin and IL -6, as well as brain iron content measured with relaxometry imaging and disease severity. Post -mortem analysis of Parkinsonian substantia nigra, divided according to Braak and Braak scores, exhibited microgliosis and increased iron accumulation, the degree of microgliosis correlating with the intensity of nigral iron staining. The response of immortalised glial cells to an inflammatory stim ulus showed an increase in the release of inflammatory markers, ie. TNF and IL -6, in addition to significant elevations of cellular iron as well as changes in hepcidin expression, although there was no evidence for hepcidin release. In conclusion, markers of inflammation and iron metabolism in both systemic and brain systems are closely linked in PD, thus offering a potential biomarker for progression of the disease.

It represents along with its derivatives very potent antitumor agents exhibiting sub -micromolar IC 50s against a variety of cancer cells. In contrast to conventional cisplatin or oxaliplatin, the mechanism of action (MoA) of 56MeSS is fundamentally different. However, the details of the mechanism by which the 5,6 -dimethyl -1,10- phenanthroline ligand contributes to the cytotoxicity of the 56MeSS complexes have not been so far sufficiently clarified . Here we show that the 56MeSS compounds exhibit an intriguing potency in the triple -negative breast cancer cells MDA -MB-231 which are known to be highly resistant to clinically used cisplatin ; these compounds exhibit antiproli ferative activity at the concentrations by several orders of magnitude lower than antitumor platinum compounds used in the clinic. Moreover, we show that the 56MeSS -based Pt(IV) compounds act by multimodal MoA resulting in the global biological effects different from that of the Pt(II) complexes, i.e., that they damage nuclear DNA, reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential, induce the epigenetic processes and last but not least , the data provide evidence that changes in the organization of cytoskeleton ne tworks are functionally important for 56MeSS -based compounds, in contrast to clinically used conventional platinum cytostatics, to kill cancer cells. The latter mechanism has not been described for other antitumor platinum compounds including those used in the clinic. In other words, changes in the organization of cytoskeleton networks is a new mechanism which asserts itself in the antitumor effects of platinum anticancer drugs and might play an important role in conveying preferential and high susceptibili ty of some cancer cells to the platinum drugs based on 56MeSS .This finding represents a promise of development of new metal -based anticancer drugs that would be active in a spectrum of human tumors different from that attainable by the platinum drugs investigated in the clinical and preclinical research [2].

For some pathogenic bacteria iron acquisition from hosts heme is essential for their proliferation and virulence; the heme degradation product biliverdin is the precursor of -family of photoreceptors in cyanobacteria and plants; and heme degradation is the initial step of heme iron recovery for iron homeostasis in mammals. All the heme degradation in plants and mammals is attained by heme oxygenase (HO) where the substrate heme activates O 2molecules, converting hemin to biliverdin with release of carbon monoxide and iron through three consecutive monooxygenase reactions via -meso -hydroxyheme and verdoheme intermediates. Mammalian two isozymes, kDa inducible HO -1 and a 36 kDa constitutive HO -2. Each isozyme ha sa single C -terminal transmembrane segment which is anchored into the endoplasmic reticulum facing cytoso l. HOs from plant, cyanobacteria and pathogenic bacteria are soluble and smaller in size (24 kDa - 29 kDa) than their mammalian counterparts. All the HO enzymes are structurally similar and share the same catalytic mechanism, which is now mostly understo od[1]. Recent discovery of new heme degrading enzymes, IsdG and IsdI of Staphylococcus aureus and MhuD of Mycobacterium tuberculosis , which are structurally and enzymatically distinct from HO, extends the spectrum of biological heme degradation [ 2]. MhuD degrades hemin to iron and mycobilin where - retains as a formyl group by sequential mono -and di -oxygenase -hydroxyheme followed by the dioxygenase reactio to mycobilin and free iron [4]. IsdG reaction catalyzes conversion of hemin to staphylobilin isomers with the release of iron and formaldehyde [5]. MhuD and IsdG catalytic mechanism swill be discussed at meeting. References [1]T.

Tau ()is a 441- mer peptide present in significant amounts in neurons, where it contributes to the stabilization of microtubules. Ins oluble amyloid aggregates of tau are associated with over 20 neurological disorders known as tauopathies, among which is Parkinson's [1]. In neurons, tau binds tubulin through its microtubule binding domain which comprises four repeats (R1 -R4) characterized by the presence of histidine residues. These regions are potential binding sites for metal ions [2]. The elucidation of the binding capacities toward metal ions, especially those redox active such as copper(II), may shed light on the biomolecular process es that underlie the progression of tauopathies [3]. In this contribution we examine the thermodynamic stability of copper(I) and copper(II) adducts with two peptide fragments which are encompassed in the R1 and R3 repeats of tau, namely Ac- 257VKSKIGSTENLKHQGGG273-NH 2(R1, HL1in its neutral form) and Ac -323GSLGNIHHKPGGG335- NH L3in its neutral form). Copper(II) binding to R1 (HL1) at pH 7.4 is dominated by the formation of [Cu(HL1)]2+, where (L1)- is tridentate. The copper(II) equatori al coordination positions are occupied by the imidazole ring of His269, two amido nitrogens, and a water molecule. As for the R3 (L3) peptide, at pH 7.4 the two most abundant species are [CuL3]2+and [Cu(L3H-1)]+(in a ratio of ca . 1:4, Fig ure1, left ). While copper(II) coordination mode in [Cu(L3H-1)]+is similar to that in [Cu(HL1)]2+, that of [CuL3]2+is different and possibly most interesting. Spectroscopic data suggest that in [CuL3]2+two imidazole donors and one amido nitrogen are equatorially coor dinated to copper(II), plus a water molecule (Figure 1, right ). The presence of this tandem HisHis fragment makes this peptide interesting in view of the stabilization of copper(I). Indeed, spectroscopic competition titration using a metallochromic indicat or clearly showed that copper(I) binds significantly to R3 at neutral pH but not to R1 . The catalytic activity in reactions of oxidation of catecholes and the NMR features of these complexes will be discussed in terms of the speciation of the thermodynamic stability of these complexes with copper in both oxidation states.

The RAS -targeted cancer therapies should be effective because RAS plays critical roles in malignant degeneration of cancer cells. However, current developments on targeting RAS have not advanced due to structural features of the RAS protein and high affinity of the RAS protein with its ligand . Here, we show that expression of NRAS, a major isoform of RAS, is controllable by photodynamic therapy (PDT) with a new photosensitizer, an anionic phthalocyanine with zinc ion (ZnAPC , UTR of the NRAS mRNA. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a low invasion cancer treatment. On the other hand, PDT also causes saviour side effects and mechanism of action remains unclear yet. These problems limit its wide application in cancer treatment. A molecularly targeted PDT (mtPDT) could be promising to overcome these problems. Here we attempted to establish mtPDT for NRAS mRNA which is overexpressed in some cancer cells. Previously, we have reported that anionic phthalocyanines (APCs) coordinating Ni2+or Cu2+bound to DNA G -quadruplexes from human telomeric DNA.1,2According to these results, we hypothesised that an anionic phthalocyanine coordinating Zn2+(ZnAPC) can control NRAS expression by photo -irradi ation because it has a high photosensitizing ability among phthalocyanine derivatives. Binding studies showed that ZnAPC bound to a G-quadruplex -forming oligonucleotide derived from 5' UTR of the NRAS mRNA in a sequence selective manner even in the presence of excess double- stranded RNA oligonucleotides. After photo- irradiation with near IR light, ZnAPC cleaved NRAS RNA G -quadruplex but not other cancer related RNA G -quadruplexes and duplexes . Cell based assays NRAS was ZnAPC reduced expression of NRAS mRNA and NRAS protein, and therefore induce dcell death. Noteworthy, i t was further shown that ZnAPC wasa capable to induce adirect transfer of energy to NRAS mRNA and induce dits breakdown upon photo -irradiation even under a low-oxygen condition, which isatypical feature of solid tumours. These results demonstrate that ZnAPC is a promising photosensitizer in the mtPDT targeting NRAS mRNA G -quadruplexes in solid tumors and RO S resistance cancers .3 Financial support by JSPS KAKENHI ( 18K19153 ) and a Grant -in-Aid for on Innovative Areas \"Chemistry for Kawauchi, Sugimoto, H.

In attempts to overcome the major drawbacks of the Pt(II) anticancer agents, toxicity and resistance, many researchers have chosen to pursue multi -action Pt(IV) prodrugs. Pt(IV) prodrugs are stable outside the cell and are activated by reduction inside the cell releasing the cytotoxic Pt(II) complex as well as the two axial ligands that can be drugs in their own right. To date, most of the bioactive ligands possess a carboxyl group through which they are tethered to the Pt(IV). This is probably due to the e ase of carboxylation of Pt(IV) complexes with axial hydroxido ligands, and to the fact that upon reduction of the Pt(IV), the axial ligand sarereleased immediately in their active form (scheme) . Many well designed and potent dual, triple and quadruple action Pt(IV) prodrugs were described using bioactive molecules with carboxy lgroups .1-3Yet, we believe that w e need to be able to expand the arsenal of bioactive ligands to molecules without carboxy lgroups especially since oft en drugs without carboxy l groups such as gemcitabine, paclitaxel, 5 -FU, irinotecan (Figure) and other sare administered in combination with Pt drugs in the clinic. We will describe the approaches we have taken to conjugating anticancer drugs such as gemcitabine or erastmustine , that do not have carboxy lgroups, to the axial positions of Pt(IV) complexes in a manner that upon reduction they release the original active form of these drugs.

Our approach is to instead to use these artificial proteins as novel ligands for the coordination of xeno metals, with no known biological role, with the view to developing functional system s for valuable applications beyond the scope of nature. We recently reported the design of the first gadolinium coiled coil, which displayed promise as a potential MRI contrast agent.[2,3] We have since interrogated the coordination of various lanthanide ions to our coiled coils and have for the first time shown that we can selectively discriminate between Ln(III) ions based on size. As a result we have now designed coiled coils capable of binding two different Ln(III) ions selectively to two different sites (see Figure), and at a defined distance from one another. The opportunities this affords and the potential applications of this new class of lanthanide coiled coils, will be discussed.

G4 -interacting compounds stabilize these structures and can disrupt cellular functions like r eplication, translation and telomere maintenance. In addition, two of them have shown promising radiosensitizing properties including a derivative of the tolyterpyridin platinum complexes [1]. Since an important strategy in cancer therapeutics is to increase tumor sensitivity to radiotherapy, deciphering the mechanism of action for radiosensitization of such complexes is of fundamental concern. In this aim, we screened metal -complexes of different G4 series non-G4-interacting pla tinum complexes for their radiosensitization potential. They were tested at their subtoxic concentrations in combination with -radiation. Four hits, belonging to different series, were found to induce radiosensitization in three cancer cell lines but not in a normal fibroblast cell line. We then focused on exploring their molecular mechanism of radiosensitization. The mandatory need of drugs post-radiation and the presence of delay in DNA damage repair post -irradiation by Pt- ttpy (one of the hits), strongl y suggests involvement of DNA repair inhibition. Interestingly, telomeric damages pre- or post-irradiation don't seem to be at the origin of radiosensitization by Pt- ttpy and reinforce the finding that these metal -complexes could interfere with radiation in duced DNA damages repair in a G4 - independent manner.

Complexes III and IV of the respiratory chain often form supercomplexes with a III 2IV2 or III 2IV stoichiometry. In S. cerevisiae these supercomplexes appear to be dynamic in nature held together by relatively weak interactions. A bound water -soluble cyt. c [1, 2] may provide a direct route for electron transfer from CIII to CIV through two -dimensional diffusion . In other organisms such as M. smegmatis or C. glutamicum the III 2IV2 super complexes are obligate, stable and establish a direct electron path between the electron donor, QH 2, and the acceptor O 2 [3]. We recently deter mined structures of the S. cerevisiae -EM. The former show s that the components associate presumably without any changes in structure that would yield differences in functionality of CIII or CIV. Instead, the proximity of CIII and CIV would yield diffusion times of cyt. c comparable to the turnover activity of CIII and CIV (~102 s-1). In M. smegmatis the structure the III2IV2 supercomplex reveals a completely architecture: ( cyt. c1 and the in canonical electron transport chains. This cyt. cc subunit displays two conformations in the two halves of the III 2IV2 supercomplex indicating that it can act as an alternating electric switch . In one hal f it provides a direct electron -transfer pathway between CIII and CIV while in the other half the connection is interrupted. ( ii) we identified a novel superoxide dismutase (SOD) subunit that is attached near the cyt. cc domain. Assuming a functional role of the SOD in the supercomplex, it may funnel electrons from O 2-, via cyt. cc, to the CIV catalytic si te. Alternatively, the product hydrogen peroxide may be used as a substrate for CIV (i.e. an electron acceptor). ( iii) we observed a menaquinone bound in an electron- donating Q o-site of CIII, which has not been identified in any other structure. The novel Q o site is formed by a cardiolipin, a 200 amino- acid residue extension of the FeS subunit and the cyt. cc subunit. ( cardiolipin molecules mediate the CIII -CIV interactions and the lipid is also found in an O 2-conducting channel in CIV. ( v) a 150 amino- acid residue extension of cyt. b (of CIII) forms a \"lid\" covering the orifice of the D -proton pathway of CIV. Because this pathway is used for transfer of protons that are pumped across the membrane, the structural arrangement suggests functional interactions between CIII and CIV . Collectively, t he data offer new insights into the functional role of respiratory supercomplexes. Financial support by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation and the Swedish Research Council.

Long interspersed nuclear elements -1 (L1) are autonomous retrotransposons that encode two proteins in different open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2). The ORF1p, which may be an RNA binding and chaperone protein, contains a three- stranded coiled coil (3SCC) domain that facilitates formation of the biologically active homotrimer. This 3SCC domain is composed of seven amino acid (heptad) repeats as found in native and designed peptides and a stammer that modifies the helical structure. Cysteine residues occur at three hydrophobic positions (2 a and 1 d site) within this domain. Base d on comparison to de novo designed peptides that contain cysteine layers in the hydrophobic core of 3SCCs, it is likely that ORF1p binds transition or heavy metals with relatively high affinities, a feature that has not been previously recognized. We have, therefore, investigated the binding of several metals to both a truncated form of the ORF1p and designed peptides, with and without stammers, intended to mimic metal binding. Based on UV -Vis, NMR, XAS spectroscopies and X -ray Crystallography we are able to demonstrate that a variety of metals (Pb(II), Cd(II) and Cu(I)) can bind to these sites. Furthermore, we will provide a hypothesis as to how metal binding may influence retrotransposition in humans depending on whether metals bind upstream or downstrea m of the stammer found in the coiled coil IL-010 Metallo -Protein DNA Guido H. Clever1 1Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical concept of metal base pairing, where bonds between transition metal cations and chemically modified nucleobases lead to defined coordination complexes inside oligonucleotides, has been insensitively studied in the context of double stranded DNA [1]. So far, reports about metal -base interactions in other DNA secondary structures remained scarce. We recently introduced a robust and synthetically feasible approach to incorporate ligands such as pyridines or imidazoles into DNA G - [2]. Both tetramolecular as well as unimolecular quadruplex sequences showed to be suited for the incorporation of one or more metal binding sites. By using telomeric sequences containing transition metal binding sites close to the loop regio n, we demonstrated copper -induced topology switching between two different G -quadruplex folding states [3]. Further, the known DNA -protein interaction between a quadruplex sequence and thrombin could be controlled in a metal -dependent way, as monitored by a fibrinogen clotting assay [3]. Recently, we expanded the scope of ligand derivatives [4]and used the incorporation of paramagnetic copper(II) centers on both remote faces of the guanine stacks to establish an EPR -based distance ruler that contributes to the toolbox of DNA structure elucidation methods [5]. Our current activities are focused on DNAzyme function [6]and enantioselective catalysis with metal - carrying G -quadruplexes, as their straightforward synthetic accessibility and well -defined coordin ation environments allow for a high degree of fine -tuning the catalytic activity. Furthermore, the single - oligonucleotide nature of the folded telomer sequences allows us to mix different ligands in the pocket created by the loop, thereby opening the potential to mimic metallo -protein activity inside an oligonucleotide environment.

These molecule sconsist of two domains; the aptamer where the metabolite is bound and the expression platform, which is the part that finally causes the gene expression regulation. Riboswitches have been also postulated as good antibiotic targets as they regulate crucia l metabolic pathways. A presumable btuB riboswitch in the genome of Klebsiella pneumoniae and has been proposed as a B 12riboswitch candidate. In our study, in -line probing experiments have been performed in order to validate the sequence as a riboswitch. A RNA conformational change has been observed in the RNA sequence upon interaction with AdoCbl. In the gene -on conformat ion, the ribosome binding site (RBS) is free and the btuB gene can be expressed. In contrast, after the metabolite interaction, the RNA is shifted to the gene -off conformation in which the RBS is masked in a base paired region. This fact proves the sequence as a riboswitch and suggests a translation inhibition mechanism. Then, using the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments, the thermodynamic parameters of the RNA -metabolite interaction have been recorded. Two different constructs were used: MB 01 which contain the aptamer (214 nt.) and JP01 carrying both the aptamer and the expression platform (246 nt.). Titrations using AdoCbl as titrant were performed for both constructs at different temperatures ranging from 15 \u00b0C to 30 \u00b0C. Taking the results together we could say that the RNA -AdoCbl interaction is exothermic and follows a 1:1 stoichiometry. The obtained These enthalpy values are in consonance with a sum of several weak interactions such as H -bond and staking. The K Dvalues for MB01 (770\u00b190 nM at 25 \u00b0C) are higher than those obtained for JP01 (530\u00b150 mM at 25 \u00b0C) in the entire temperature range. Thus, we can conclude that the presence of the expression platform in JP 01 stabilizes the interaction of the btuB riboswitch with the AdoCbl [1]. The inhibition translation mechanism was also proved by coupling the riboswitch to a red fluorescent protein ( mCherry ). The protein synthesis was inhibited after increasing amounts of AdoCbl were added to the culture media. Moreover, it has been also studied the effect of the ancillary ligands' integrity over the translation, by using cyanocobalamin and cobyric acid inst ead of the entire coenzyme. Recently, there is a growing research interest in ligand analogues that are tested for antibiotic potential through riboswitch inhibition.

COPD patients treated with intravenous iron (IV Fe) and/or transfusions of red blood cells (RBC) for iron deficiency anemia (IDA) were compared to a control group of untreated COPD patients.

Risk factors for infection were assessed by multivariate logistic regression. IDA was common in hospitalized patients with COPD. Hgb and Hct increased significantly with IV Fe or RBC (or both) treatment. Correction of the Fe deficiency in COPD patients with IV Fe can improve IDA but may result in an increased risk of infection and an increased hospital stay.

Additionally, t he terminal metabolite BVIX functions as a positive post-transcriptional regul the heme signalling cascade ,and a transcriptional activator of several operons encoding systems involved in iron- acquisition (pyochelin) and virulence (proteases and Type III secretion systems) . Based on our mechanistic characterization of the heme sensing and transport pathways we will present data on the design, synthesis and activity of novel lead compounds targeting; i) the HasAp -HasR interaction with metallosalophen s,and ii) HemO with small molecule inhibitors that target the heme binding site or a recently identified allosteric site (10).Targeting heme uptake at several critical junctures effecting both heme sensing and uptake leads to a global disruption ofiron-homeostasis and virulence , while placing less selective pressure on the bacteria to undergo mutation leading to drug resistance.

The highly efficient and selective enzymatic process of life systems is certainly a power ful means to fulfil the need of environmentally friendly chemical activities. An artificial mimetic enzyme, compared to a natural enzyme, is a non -protein molecule and is simpler in structure, and the artificial mimetic enzyme can realize a combination with a substrate and the catalysis of the process. Construction of metal -organic architectures with a unique species of functional molecular containers has obtained increasing attention due to its prominent recognition properties and fascinating reactivity reminiscent of the natural enzyme s. These well -defined cavities generated by architectures provided inner void spaces and functional interaction sites for selective encapsulation of specific guest molecules and catalysing related reactions. Because of the promising functionalities of arch itectures as artificial metalized host platforms, it is possible for these molecular hosts to mimic protein receptors or enzymes and also potential for effectively binding to substrates, stabilizing reactive intermediates or catalysing chemical transformations. The metal -organic hosts with a high activity center structure of enzyme can serve as a carrier for electrons and chemical groups, shorten the distance between reaction substrates so that increase the reaction speed. Herein we rep orted the synthesis and catalytic properties of several metal -organic hosts to investigate the possibility in the application of enzymatic mimic . These metal -organic architectures could capsule guest molecular through specific inner spaces and bonding sites and realize natural enzymes mimic .Metal - organic polyhedron can retain the enzyme activity and provide a good environment for the catalytic process .

Though recent studies have shown that RNA G -quadruplexes (GQ) may have pivotal functionalit iesin many biological and pathological progress es, the transient folding and unfolding of RNA GQ in live cells remain ambiguous, which hampers the understandings of RNA GQ behavior in many disease cells . Recently our group developed a series of [Pt(bpa)]2+complexes (bpa: bis(1,10- phenanthrolin -2-yl)am ine). The complexes with the alkylated aza -NHbridge showed unprecedented high stabilizing effects on RNA G-quadruplexes, such as TERRA RNA.1Inspired by the duplex -specific fluorogenic mechanism of [Ru(dppz)(bpy) 2]2+complexes, -NH moiety as a probe. Both complexes showed high fluorescent intensity (QM ~0.45) and large stoke shift upon binding RNA and DNA GQ, while negligible fluorescence was observed in aqueous buffer and on dup lex or single stranded DNA/RNA. The planar shape and size of the complexes renders specific binding, but not stabilizing to GQ. A triplet excited state which can be stabilized to have microsecond lifetime due to 1) breaking H-bond network with solvent; 2)restricing thermal vibration/rotation and 3)preventing energy transfer to oxygen when 1stacks on G -quartets. As fluorogenic probe, 1was used to stain RNA/DNA GQ in fixed cancerous cells and track the folding dynamics of RNA GQ in live cells. The fluorescent foci of 1 showed HeLa cells have much higher quantity of RNA GQ than the healthy CHO cells at any time during 1 second period. However the fluorescent intensity fluctuated much more significantly in CHO cells, which suggested in general RNA GQs are less stable in healthy cells. By using Pt complexes as fluorogenic probes, the quantity and folding dynamics of RNA GQs are directly compared between cancerous and healthy cells. These inorganic probes hold great potentials in monitoring GQ -targeting molecules in both cancerous and somatic cells, screening the drugs for cancer treatment and evaluating the drug efficiency on targeting GQs.

Diabetes is a human pathophysiology , spreading rapidly over the entire world population. It is defined as a group of metabolic abnormalities due to insulin deficiency and/or resistance. A gross distinction of the disease can be made through two types, na mely Diabetes mellitus type I and II. Efforts over the years have concentrated on replacing insulin and current therapies or enhancing their activity. To that end, a number of studies support the notion that select metal ions (endogenous or exogenous) could a) enhance or mimic insulin action in vitro and in vivo, b) induce cellular glucose uptake, c) contribute to the control of blood glucose levels, d) induce adipogenesis, and e) interact with essential components of the human body metabolic regulation s ystem [1 -4]. Consequently, focusing on early cellular events , culminating with glucose uptake , could shed light onto strategies that could improve considerably current therapeutic protocols or provide new solutions to fighting hyperglycemia. In line with such logic, gaining insight into cellular differentiation of adipose tissue, i.e. the process of adipogenesis, would lead to antidiabetic factors that stand to ameliorate treatment of diabetic patients. Poised to pursue an investigation of the cellular differentiation of adipose tissue, relying primarily on well-configured complex forms of metal ions (known for their antidiabetic proclivity and nthesized a pH - dependent fashion , isolated and physicochemically characterized in the solid state and in solution. The selection, design and synthetic approaches employed to obtain soluble and bioavailable complex forms of metal -citrates were consisten t with the principles of structural speciation, adhered to in all cases of metal ions interacting with the physiological binder of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The so selected and defined complex species were employed in biotoxicity profile and cellular differentiation studies under physiological conditions and using adipocytes as study models. The biotoxicity profiles of all species were examined in adipocyte cultures to determine which forms should be introduced to the ensuing cell differentiation phas e. The process of cell differentiation and maturation of pre -adipocytes to their ultimate mature form was pursued in the presence- absence of insulin (appropriate control). Intimately associated with the process was monitoring closely linked genetic targets, key to adipocyte maturation (PPAR -, GLUT 1,3,4, Adiponectin (ADIPOQ), Glucokinase (GCK), Insulin receptor (INS -R) and resistin). In parallel, studies were conducted to inquire into the adipogenic potential of the employed binary metal complex forms b eing suppressed or synergically enhanced by insulin, thereby providing further insight into new mechanistic alternatives in therapeutic administration protocols. The experimental results a) project distinctly unique biotoxicity profiles for the selected meta -citrate species and commensurably distinct adipogenic biological profiles for the metalloforms involved in a dose-, time - and nature -dependent manner, and b) show clearly metal ion -specific adipogenic response - signals at the same or higher level than insulin toward all selected targets. The adipogenic potential of the structurally select metalloforms , bearing a common hydroxycarboxylic acid chelator substrate, also provides a basis of insulin mimetic comparison toward cellular differentiation of adip ocytes , seeking maturation and through it glucose uptake. Collectively, the study model invoked and delved into provides a holistic view of the insulin mimetic metal -induced adipogenicity profile , encompassing well -defined interactions with biomolecular targets known to intervene and effect cell maturation. The so derived knowledge gives rise to reliable molecular biomarkers that support technological advancements toward therapeutic approaches in the fight against Diabetes mellitus II. References [1] H.

They are able to efficiently decompose chlorite (ClO 2-or OClO-) into harmless chloride (C l-) and dioxygen (O 2) with chlorite being the sole source of dioxygen. Thereby, a covalent oxygen- oxygen bond is formed, a biochemical reaction that was believed to be unique to the water -splitting manganese complex of photosystem II of oxygenic organisms. Although structure and steady- state kinetics of Clds have been elucidated [1], many questions remain, e.g. about the mechanism of chlorite cleavage and the pH dependence of the reaction. Computational studies suggested homolytic cleavage of OClO-thereby producing chlorine monoxide (ClO) and Compound [Por...Fe(IV)=O], whereas biochemical studies suggested heterolytic cleavage of chlorite thereby Compound I [Por+...Fe(IV)=O] and hypochlorite (HOCl/-OCl) as transient intermediates. The pH optimum of chlorite degradation is typically in the acidic pH range and it was postulated that this reflects the protonation state of the strictly conserved flexible distal arginine. Here, we present high resolution X -ray crystal structures of a dimeric Cld at pH 6.5 and 8.5, its fluoride and isothiocyanate complexes and the neutron structure at pH 9.0 together with the pH dependence of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox couple, and the UV -vis and resonance Raman spectral features. We demonstrate that the distal Arg127 cannot act as proton acceptor and is fully ionized even at pH 9.0 ruling out its proposed role in dictating the pH dependence of chlorite degradation. Stopped- flow studies show that Compound I and hypochlorite do not recombine, whereas Compound II is the immedia tely formed redox intermediate that dominates during turnover. with a Reduced CO 2Ligand Generated by Formate Deprotonation and its Behaviour towards CO berlin.de Reduced CO 2species are key intermediates in a variety of natural and synthetic processes.

We report on a Ni -CO 22-complex (Figure 1) that is unique in many ways.1While its structural and electronic features help understanding the CO 2bound state in Ni,Fe carbon monoxide dehydrogenases,2its rea ctivity sheds light on how CO 2can be converted into CO/CO 32-by nickel complexes. In addition, the complex has been generated via a rare example of formate -deprotonation, a mechanistical step relevant to nickel electro des3and formate C. S.; A.

We and others have been exploiting the potential of the biotin -(strept)avidin technology for the creation of artificial metalloenzymes, Figure. Thanks to the remark able supramolecular affinity of biotin for either avidin or streptavidin ( KD> 10-13M), linking of a biotin anchor to a catalyst precursor ensures that, upon stoichiometric addition of (strept)avidin, the metal moiety is quantitatively incorporated within the host protein. Alternatively, human carbonic anhydrase has proven equally versatile for the development of artificial metalloenzymes relying on aryl- sulfonamide anchors to ensure the localization of the abiotic metallocofactors within the host protein. The resulting artificial metalloenzymes can be optimized either by chemical (variation of the anchor - spacer -ligand moiety) or genetic -(mutation of the host protein ) means. These chemo -genetic schemes were applied to optimize the performance for twelve different catalyzed transformations as well multiple reaction cascades in the presence of natural enzymes.1 More recently, we have been investigating the potential of artificial metalloenzymes for in vivo catalysis to complement metabolic pathways.

Platinum -based chemotherapy remains standard of care for different types of cancer, with over half of all cancer patients receiving cisplatin, carboplatin or oxaliplatin in chemotherapeutic treatment. The clinically used Pt(II) drugs undergo hydrolysis to form active [L swith DNA, eliciting DNA damage, inhibiting DNA repair mechanisms and consequently inducing apoptosis.

However, it has proved difficult to enhance and expand their functions through genetic engineering. Here we report a genetically encoded, 27 kDa photosensitizer protein (PSP), which facilitates the rational design of miniature photocatalytic CO 2-reducing enzymes. Visible light drives PSP efficiently into a long -lived triplet excited state (PSP*), which reacts rapidly with reduced ni cotinamide adenine dinucleotide to generate a super - reducing radical (PSP dot), which is strong enough to reduce many CO 2-reducing catalysts. We determined the three -dimensional structure of PSPat 1.8\u00c5 resolution by X -ray crystallography. Genetic engine ering enabled the site -specific attachment of a nickel -terpyridine complex and the modular optimization of the photochemical properties of PSP, the chromophore/catalytic centre distance and the catalytic centre microenvironment, which culminated in a miniature photocatalytic CO 2-reducing enzyme (mPCE) that has a CO 2/CO conversion quantum efficiency of 2.6%.

Metalloenzymes coenzyme A synthase use earth -abundant transition metals such as nickel and iron to perform highly efficient energy conversion and storage reactions ,such as H 2evolution and oxidation, CO 2fixation, and carbon -carbon bond formation. However, the native enzymes are costly to isolate, sensitive to external conditions, and generally poorly suited for large -scale application , rendering anthropogenic utilization impractical . We have approached this problem from a metal loprotein engineering perspective. Using robust scaffolds such as azurin and rubredoxi n, we have developed model proteins that mimic the structure and function of these native enzymes . By introducing non -native metals and redesigning the primary and second ary coordination spheres, we have install ednovel activity into these simple electron transfer proteins, including catalytic hydrogen evolution and carbon dioxide fixation. Adding key elements from the secondary and tertiary coordination spheres of hydroge nase and CODH enhances both activity and selectivity, pointing to functional roles of specific residues within the natural enzymes. Optical, vibrational, and magnetic resonance spectroscopic techniques have been used in conjunction with density functional theory calculations to probe the active -site structures across different states in order to determine the catalytic mechanisms. These findings will be discussed in the context of identifying the fundamental principles underlying highly active native enzyme s and applying those principles towards engineering effective model metalloproteins for energy conversion reactions.

Crystal structures , spectr oscopic studies and model complexes show cysteine binding via the thiol and amine to leave the sixth coordination site, the dioxygen binding site, partially occupied by a water molecule [1]. The substrate cysteine is held in place through the carboxylate of cysteine forming a salt-bridge with arginine 60. Similar type binding topologies can be proposed for the other carboxylate containing substrates [2].We have been exploring substrate orientation and its e ffect on the catalytic cycle though a series of k inetic, spectroscopic and theoretical experiments [3].We will describe in this presentation the current state of our research .

This seminar will describe our efforts in understanding the mechanistic basis for two structurally divergent enzymes that convert fatty acids into terminal alkenes via a cry ptic decarboxylation reaction .A common theme found in these biocatalysts is the rewiring of iron -containing cofactors that are most often associated with oxygen insertion chemistry to catalyze carbon -carbon cleavage instead.

Thus, the structures, physical properties and reactivity toward protons -electrons and/or substrates are of fundamental interest in biological and chemical systems where dioxygen -reduction occurs (e.g., also in fuel cells), and where organic substrates are oxidized or oxygenated. Our primary research approach in copper -dioxygen chemistry focuses on ligand design and variation and the use of cryogenic solution handling for the study of new complexes. In these contexts, a description of new (ligand)CuIIn-superoxo complexes (n = 1, 2) will be presented, Tripodal tetradentate ligands with built -in hydrogen- bonding modalities enhance both the stability (i.e., solution lifetime) and reactivit y toward O -H (i.e., phenols) and C -H substrates.

For some c ases, dicopper(II) superoxo/peroxo reduction potentials have been obtained. Also, superoxo- dicopper(II) complexes can undergo hydrogen- atom abstraction reactions with O -H or C -H substrates , producing a hydroperoxo- dicopper(II) complex product.

Precision oncology is a focus of most emerging approaches to cancer treatment. In this presentation, we will argue that for metal -based cytotoxic agents to contribute fully to precision medicine -based approaches to cancer treatment , strategies are required to focus their action, both to tumours themselves and to the various microenvi ronments that exist within a solid tumour. Such approaches have the potential to reduce the side effects that limit the application and effectiveness of cytotoxic anticancer agents and to generate more durable outcomes. Precision based approaches to cancer treatment can in principle be based on any features that characterise a tumour and there have been a significant number of studies of using nutrient transporters to selectively deliver platinum complexes to tumour cells that overexpress these transporters [1]. However, there has been little consideration given to using the profile of transporter expression or of protease activity in the tumour environment for developing individualised treatment strategies. We will report on our work aimed at developing lo w toxicity pro -drugs which exploit the biological features of different tumour cell properties and the tumour environment with a particular focus on using transporter and protease over-expression to selectively deliver platinum complexes to tumour cells (see Figure) . The features required in a complex and the effect of the coordination sphere on the stability and activation of platinum(IV) prodrugs and cobalt(III) based drug delivery vehicles will be described as will examples of strategies for achieving selective uptake of these complexes by cancer cells. We will also discuss the challenges to developing biological systems that are able to replicate the effects of such complexes and establish their potential for use in precision oncology.

E -mail: ksakai@chem.kyushu- univ.jp Over the past decade, our group has focused on the studies of transition -metal -based molecular systems relevant to the development of a rtificial photosynthetic molecular devices. The targets of our research involve the studies on (i) water oxidation catalysis in order to uptake protons and electrons required for fuels generation, (ii) catalytic water or CO 2reduction into sustainable fuels (i.e., H 2, CO, etc.), (iii) artificial light -harvesting systems towards the effective charge separation and/or migration, and (iv) molecular -and instrumental -level chemical engineering by making hybrid molecular and/or heterogeneous systems using multiple key components. Deeper insights into the mechanism of reaction of interest are always greatly appreciated for the sake of inspiring the rational design strategies towards the more desirable/efficient systems in promoting all relevant processes. In this context, substantial efforts have been devoted to more carefully study the reaction kinetics and equilibria in solution that are relevant to each topic. Various spectrophotometric, electrochemical, and photochemical techniq ues have been adopted to better understand the mechanistic aspects relevant to all of our systems. Some of the reaction steps of interest are not observable by any experimental techniques, and must be discussed on the basis of our DFT results, which have a lso greatly helped us understand the mechanism of reactions. Importantly, one of our findings is that, in any catalysis, the reactivity of metal(s) can be rationally tuned by use of redox active ligands that are more or less hybridized with metal(s) in the ir orbitals. Such issues are often involved in our discussion. One of our interests has concentrated on the molecular Pt -catalyzed hydrogen evolution reactions and their application to fabricate photosensitizer -catalyst hybrid molecular devices [1 - 3]. Our recent kinetic and electrochemical studies evidence the formation of a hydridodiplatinum(II,III) intermediate when H 2evolution is catalyzed by a simple mononuclear Pt(bpy)Cl 2derivative, which is also rationalized by our DFT results. Our studies have also provided new aspects on photo -induced multi - charge separation [4], near -infrared -driven water reduction [5], water oxidation catalysis using various transition metal complexes [6,7], non -precious metal based H 2evolution catalysis [8], and photoelectroche mical cells for References [1]Ozawa, H.; Haga, of Chemical Sciences and Engineering, Laboratory of Inorganic Synthesis and Catalysis, Microbiology, Karl -von-Frisch -Stra\u00dfe 10, 35043 Marburg, Germany. Understanding the choice of Nature in specific metal ions for bio chemical reactions is a fundamental subject in biocatalysis. Hydrogenases, enzymes that produce or activate molecular H 2,use exclusively Fe and Ni . However, other transition metals such as Mn, Co, and Ru are known to activate hydrogen in synthetic systems. Here, we report the development of a Mn-based biomimetic model of [Fe] - hydrogenase. This Mn complex is able to heterolytically cleave H 2as well as catalyze hydrogenation reactions. Incorporation of the model into an apoenzyme of [Fe] -hydrogenase results in a [Mn] - non-native metal hydrogenase .Our findings raisean intriguing question - why does nature choose Fe over Mn?

Cu(II) ions and A peptides coexist in synaptic clefts of glutamatergic neurons, due to involvement of both in neurotransmission. Recently we proposed that N- terminally truncated A 4-xpeptides rather than \"canonical\" A 1-xpeptides may be key Cu(II) targets in this environment. This proposal has been based on our comprehensive studies on Cu(II) binding to A 4-xpeptides, redox properties of the resulting complexes and their susceptibility to Cu(II) exchange. We found that (i) A 4-xpeptides bind Cu(II) very tightly ( Kd= 30 fM at pH 7.4, 3000 times stronger than A 1-xpeptides) and compete Cu(II) out from the latter; (ii) CuA 4-xcomplexes are redox inactive in the biologically accessible potential range, cannot be reduced to Cu(I), but undergo irreversible oxidation to Cu(III); (iii) due to a kinetic barrier CuA 4-x complexes do not yield copper to metallothionein- 3 (MT3), a brain copper scavenger, but such transfer can be enabled by high concentrations of reducing agents [1]. These findings prompted us to formulate a new view on copper/A relations in the brain. A very high stability of CuA 4-xand the lack of kinetic barrier between these peptides indicate that A 4-xwill prevent Cu(II) binding to coexisting A 1-x peptides. Thereby, copper will be kept redox silent. The reluctance of CuA 4-xto yield copper to MT3 indicates a separate copper transport pathway . Furthermore, we studied the action of neprilysin on A 1-x peptides and revealed the formation of the extremely tight CuA 4-9complex Kd= 6.6 fM at pH 7.4) [2]. The formation of such small, hydrophilic complex suggest sits role in copper clearance. Altogether, A 4-x peptides emerge as protecting agents, scavenging synapses from excess of copper and thus enabling continuous neurotransmission. Our proposal is based on an assumption, shared by all copper/A concepts, that the systems studied are in chemical equilibrium. This assumption is supported by an established view of synaptic cleft as a well-mixed environment . However, neurotransmission may occur on a millisecond scale, comparable to rates of Cu(II) complex formation. Therefore, it is prerequisite to understand th e mechanism of Cu(II) association and dissociation from these peptides with respect to copper transporters and reducing agents to elucidate the chemistry underlying synaptic copper recycling of A 4-xpeptides . From the point of view of Alzheimer's patholog y, it is also important to understand the relation between Cu(II) binding kinetics and seeding of aggregated Aspecies [3]. We established the time scale of several such model processes and discovered the existence of intermediate, partially coordinated complexes in Cu A 4-xand simpler ATCUN model complexes, with altered reactivity. Stochastic simulations indicate that these species may be involved in fast synaptic Cu(II) scavenging, while the fully formed four -coordinate CuA 4-x complexes may present temporary storage for Cu(II), mobilized in slower physiological processes.

Email: i45100a@nucc.cc.nagoya- u.ac.jp Iron-sulfur clusters are ubiquitous in nature, and they have been found in various metalloproteins , often exhibiting electron -transfer functions . For instance, the cuboidal Fe 4S4(Cys) 4] cluster exhibits multiple oxidation states with almost no geometrical changes, and the cuboidal [4Fe4S] core structure with the 2Fe(II)2 Fe(III) oxidation state is known to be thermodynamically robust. On the other hand, it has been proposed that the [ 4Fe4S] cubane in the fumarate nitrate transformed to dinuclear [2 Fe2S] cores under O 2, while the protein dissociates DNA [1]. A similar oxidative decomposition of [ 4Fe4S] Nif was postulated to occur generating [2Fe 2S] cores [2]. We have reported a series of reactions displaying facile interconver sion between [ 4Fe4S]and [2Fe2S] -ferric cluster, [Fe 4S4{N(SiMe 3)2}4] (1) (py) or pyridine derivatives (py -R) resulted to [Fe 2S2{N(SiMe 3)2}2 (py-R)2] (2). Conversely , fusion of two [2Fe 2S] cores of 2 was found to be facilitated by B(C 6F5)3, generating (1) and ( Py-R)B(C 6F5)3. Interestingly reduction 2 with 10H8] in THF afforded [Fe 4S4{N(SiMe 3)2}4]2-, while an reduction of 2 with 0.5 equiv of Na[C 10H8] gave rise to [Fe 2, 4, 6-tri-isopropylbenzenethiol [4]. A better P -cluster [8Fe-7S] model complex ( 4) with two bridging Tbt thiolates has been synthesized recently from Fe{N(SiMe 3)2}2, HS -tbt, and S 8, by way of all-ferric cuboidal Fe 4S4(S-tbt) 4 [5,6]. The geometric parameters of the [8Fe -7S] core of 4 are in fact practically identical to those of nitrogenase PN-cluster. This study indicates that the P -cluster [8Fe-7S] core can be generated from highly -oxidized [4Fe -4S] cubanes , and that a desulfurization process must be a key to this transformation. Perhaps it is time to seek for new enzymes showing a yet- unknown desulfurization function in nature. References [1] C. Popescu, D. M. Bates, H. Beinert, E. M\u00fcnck, P. J.

Artificial metalloenzyme shave the potential of combining thewide reaction scope of synthetic catalysts with the selectivity and biocompatibility of proteins [1]. Inspired by the way in which certain pathogenic bacteria use tetradentate siderophores to acquire essential iron [2], we have developed a new siderophore -based anchor to reversibly connect catalysts to protein scaffolds, creating artificial enzymes . This reversible 'catch -and-release' approach is illustrated below (see figure) for the assembly and disassembly of an artificial transfer hydrogenase. In the presence of iron(III) ,the siderophore -based anchor binds anorganometallic imine -reduction catalyst to its cogna te protein scaffold, producing the artificial enzyme, but on reduction to iron(II), takes place and the artifi cial enzyme disassembles . Since the catalyst produces racemic product in the absence of the protein scaffold, but a reproducible enantiomeric excess if protein bound, the assembly and reductively triggered disassembly of the artif icial transfer hydrogenase can be monitored [3]. Importantly, t he reversibility of the anchoring system allows the individual components, in pa rticular the protein, to be recovered and reused .

Many groups have developed and studied POM WOCs t hat contain only earth -abundant elements since our report of the first such catalyst \"Co 4P2\"(X-ray structure inFigure, left ).1,2A grand challenge in water oxidation and solar fuel production is the development of inexpensive , effective WOCs that also function in strong acid. We will report new earth -abundant -element POMs that are both very good in strong base and, more importantly, in strong acid. A central challenge in catalytic water oxidation (the OEC or nonbiological catalysts) is to understand at the molecular level the electronic structure and others factors of the WOC that control the rates and selectivities of electron transfer, PCET and oxygen -oxygen bond formation ,as well as catalyst stability. Current studies and knowledge will be described. In order to assess the impact of changing the electronic structure of the WOC active site metal (Co blue spheres in the Figure complexes) ,by changing the internal, solvent -inaccessible, adjacent transition metals (e.g. Ni green spheres in Figure, right) we succeeded in preparing and purifying complexes such as the CoNiNiCo complex (X -ray structure in Figure, right )and confirming both the placement and percent occupancy of similar Z value 3d metals (e.g. Coand Ni) using synchrotron anomalous dispersion diffraction in conjunction with a conventional ensemble of spectroscopic and diffraction techniques .This central metal , like more conventional factors such as proton -accepting proximal ligands, impacts WOC rates and stabili ty.

Borovik1 1Department of Chemistry, 92697 . aborovik @uci.edu Metalloproteins perform functions not yet achieved in abiotic systems. One reason for this lack of function is the inability of control of the microenvironments about the metal centers. Microenvironments are defined as the volume of space proximal to the metal centers that encompass the secondary coordinate spheres. Results from structural biology point to non -covalent interactions within microenvironments as instrumental in regulating function. Therefore, the function and dysfunction of metalloproteins can be understood within the context of changes within their mic roenvironments. We are developing systems that allows for the confinement of metal center within hosts to regulate the properties of the immobilized metal centers. Our approach esprovide the necessary control to produce new complexes with primary coordinat ion spheres that resemble those found in natural metalloproteins. Moreover, control of the secondary sphere is designed into our systems, including the site -specific incorporation of functional groups that can promote intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The abi lity to regulate the binding and microenvironment within the host also eliminates unproductive metal- metal interactions and allows for systematic studies into structure -function relationships. This presentation will describe our results in developing syste ms that confine biological relevant metallocofactors with Fe, Mn, or Cu centers to probe O2activation or water oxidation.

Hem e binding to A peptides has opened up a new direction in this field. The active site environment of heme -A has been defined using several spectroscopic techniques and site directed mutagenesis. The heme -A peptides can act as peroxidases and neur otransmitters like serotonin through high valent intermediates. These entities can interact with physiologically available redox active metals like Cu and signaling molecules like NO and CO. They can use cytochrome c as redox partners and donate t he heme to proteins like myoglobin and neuroglobin. Three amino acid residues unique in mammalian A (Arg5, Tyr10 and His13) and missing in A from rodents which do not get affected by AD, play significant roles in the reactivities exhibited by heme -Acomplexes.

These macrocyclic or linear natural product ligands play key roles in orchestrating bacterial iron supply , with alternative coordination complexes relevan tto medicine, medical imaging and environment al remediation .Native siderophores from all classes (hydroxamic acid, catecholate, citric acid) are produced in bacterial culture in low yield, which provides impetus to develop methods that simultaneously improve access and expand structural diversity. Access to hydroxa mic acid -containing macrocyclic siderophores has been explored using a metal - templated synthesis (MTS) approach [1,2] . In this approach, the reaction between an endo- hydroxamic acid amino carboxylic acid monomer and Fe(III) forms a pre- complex with the ami no and carboxylic acid groups from contiguous monomers oriented for peptide -based in situring closure. The architecture of the metal -loaded (holo) macrocycle and the cognate apo -macrocycle, which can be generated following removal of the metal ion template with EDTA or DTPA , can be directed by the monomer, the metal ion, and the reaction stoichiometry [3,4] . Here, we present a new synthetic route toward endo- hydroxamic acid monomers with improved yields, time efficiency and structural diversity, compared to established methods [5]. We have used Fe(III)- based MTS to generate a suite of six new non-native dimeric macrocyclic siderophores as Fe(III) positioned methylene, ether macrocycle backbone. Two ether -containing isomers showed a remarkable difference in solvation, based on the surrogate measure of RP -HPLC elution time. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed structural distinctions between the two isomers and gave significantly different calculated dipole moments ,which support edexperiment. MTS prove sto be auseful avenue for producing structurally diverse non- native hydroxamic acid macrocycles.

The conversion of dinitrogen to ammonia is a challenging, energy intensive process, which is enabled biologically by the nitrogenase family of enzymes. The Mo -dependent nitrogenases contain two cofactors, the 8Fe- 8S Mo -7Fe-9S-C iron -molyb denum cofactor, known as \"FeMoco\", which is the active site for dintirogen reduction. FeMoco has long been, and continues to be, an enigmatic cluster. Over 8 years ago the presence of a carbide in the cluster was first revealed. However, the role of the carbide, the role of the Mo heterometal, and the changes which occur at the seven iron sites during the course of catalysis all remain open questions. Herein, we present studies of selenium incorporated FeMoco. High -energy resolution fluorescence detected X -ray absorption spectroscopy (HERFD XAS) at the Se K -edge is utilized to obtain selective information about the electronic structure of FeMoco. These studies reveal a significant asymmetry in the electron distribution within FeMoco, suggesting a much more l ocalized electronic structure than typically assumed for iron sulfur clusters. Further XAS studies of both natively reduced and cryoreduced MoFe protein will be presented. These studies are essential for establishing the nature of the first redox event in the catalytic cycle of nitrogenase. Together, these studies form a basis for unravelling the electronic structural details of this complex catalytic process.

Building on our recently developed method for reductive amination by photoredox catalysis [1], a joint effort between the Ward and Wenger laborat ories led to a new method for the synthesis of enantioenriched amines from imines that relies on catalytic teamwork between a photocatalyst and an enzyme [2]. Using a strongly reducing Ir photocatalyst and ascorbate as an electron and hydrogen atom source, imines were reduced to racemic amines. The enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO -N-9) was employed to oxidize one of the two amine enantiomers back to the initial imine substrate. Over time, this cyclic reaction network (performed in a one -pot reaction) leads to accumulati on of a single amine enantiomer. The concepts developed in this project should be widely applicable to a variety of chemical transformations. This work was generously supported by the NCCR Molecular Systems Engineering. Using the new water -soluble Ir photocatalyst as well as more common Ru sensitizers, we subsequently explored new photochemistry in water, which could be of interest at the interface between bioinorganic and physical -inorganic chemistry. This includes the d emonstration of relatively efficient triplet- triplet annihilation upconversion in water [3], as well as the generation of hydrated electrons using visible light and their use in preparative -scale chemical conversions [4].

Vectorization of bactericide compounds by siderophores (iron chelators produced by bacteria) is a promising Trojan horse strategy able to considerably increase the efficacy of drugs by overcoming the impermeability of the bacterial wall, especially that of Gram -negative ba cteria [1]. In such a Trojan horse strategy, the idea is that each time a bacterium internalizes a ferric ion, a molecule of drug is transported as well. To develop such a strategy it is very important to have a good knowledge of bacterial iron acquisition pathways. Iron is a cofactor of many redox -dependent enzymes and thus essential for growth and virulence. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a human opportunist pathogen, is able to express in order to get access to iron: (i) a ferrous iron uptake pathway, (ii) two h aem uptake pathways, (iii) t wo ferric iron acquisition pathways involving the siderophores pyoverdine and pyochelin (produced by the pathogen itself) and at last(iv)iron acquisition pathways involving siderophores produced by other bacteria (exosideroph ores) [2].The presence of exosiderophores in P. aeruginosa environment is sensed by the pathogen, which in response expresses specific transporters for the uptake of their ferric- forms. Using proteomic and molecular biology approaches, we have investigated how P. aeruginosa adapts the expression of its iron acquisition pathways depending on its environment and in different growth conditions : iron restricted growth conditions, epithelial c ell infection assay, in the absence or presence of exosiderophores or siderophore -antibiotic conjugates . We exosiderophores or siderophore -antibiotic conjugates were clearly more efficient in inducing the expression of the ir corresponding transporters than other siderophores because of their very high affinity for iron. In parallel, a significant repression of the expression of the proteins of the pyochelin pathway, and at a lower extend of the pyoverdine pathway, were as w ell observed, indicating clearly that bacteria opt for the use of the catechol siderophores to get access to iron when such compounds are present in their environment. No effect was seen on the expression levels of the ha em or citrate uptake pathways. The data point out that catechol siderophores are the most promising siderophores in Trojan horse strategies where siderophores are used as vectors to transport antibiotics into bacteria.

Frequently, when the interface between subunits is examined closely, the apparent non -crystallographic or even the enforced crystallographic symmetry is not perfect. For example, in the manganese superoxide dismutase structure, the two -fold symmetry relating pairs of subunits looks to be very good indeed, at least as concerns t he secondary and tertiary structure (left panel below) . Indeed, most of the amino -acid side chains maintain essentially identical conformations in both subunits, including the pair of serine residues (Ser126) that are hydrogen- bonded across, in this case, a non -crystallographic two -fold axis. However, the hydrogen atoms of the hydroxyl groups must be disordered and the symmetry less than perfect - barring a here most unlikely deprotonation. Moreover, one manganese ion is unequivocally Mn(II) and five-coordi nate whereas the other is Mn(III) and six -coordination is completed by an azide ion. This and other structures where subtle asymmetry at an otherwise two -fold symmetric interface appears to propagate to substantial asymmetry at the active site will be described and discussed with a view to functional implications and/or crystal packing a rtefacts. The consequences of Ser126Asp and Ser126Trp mutations at this dimer interface will also be presented. The former mutation somewhat remarkably preserves the dimer interface to high pH ; the latter mutation partially preserves the dimer interface but causes the C -terminal helices (residues 180- 205) to fold out and insert in a domain- swapped manner into a neighbouring dimer, forming a dodecamer (right panel below ).

In order to evaluate the feasibility of sulfur -supported three -coordinate iron sites, we have prepared the first compounds with fully sulfide -coordinated three -coordinate iron. We show that a [2Fe -1S] precursor leads to [2Fe -2S] clusters as well as novel [4Fe- 3S] and [10Fe -8S] structures with three -coordinate sites or sites with three sulfides and a weakly coordinated solvent molecule. The [4Fe- 3S] cluster is particularly interes ting, because instead of a high -spin electronic configuration like other iron -sulfur clusters, the planar geometry and short Fe -S bonds of the central iron site lead to a surprising low -spin electronic configuration as determined by spectroscopy and ab ini tiocalculations. In a demonstration of biomimetic reactivity, the [4Fe -3S] cluster reduces hydrazine, a natural substrate of nitrogenase , to give the first example of NH 2bound to an iron -sulfur cluster.

Suitable chelators for the radioisotopes are commonly based on various macrocycles but they mostly suffer from in vivo instability, slow (= not efficient) radiola beling and/or a low selectivity over competing ions. Currently, the most commonly used have been derivatives of NOTA. Cyclam derivatives offer a high thermodynamic selectivity for Cu(II) and relatively fast complexation omplexes of cross- bridged ( are very stable in -vivo -however, their radiolabelling is not efficient. Recently, we have found that bis(phosphinic acid) pendant arm (BPi ),bound to cyclam (TE1PPi) highly accelerate in -cage Cu(II) complexation and kinetic inertness of the complexes is preserved [1]. Among various pendant arms bound to Me 3cyclam as a model macrocycle, phosphonic acid and bis(phosphinic acid) pendants were shown as the most efficient ones for fast copper (II)binding [2]. The convenient properties are preserved in bifunctional ligands and in their conjugates, and the labeled conjugates are stable in -vivo producing superb PET images [3].To check if the phosphorus acid pendant arms w ould also improve properties of cross -bridged cyclams towards and bis(phosphinic acid) -TE2PPi) pendant arms were synthesized and studied. Thermodynamic, formation/decomplexation kinetic, the solid -state structural a nd radiolabelling data were obtained. The ligands behave asproton sponges with the last pKa> 14. Thermodynamic stability of the irCu(II) complexes is slightly lower t han that of analogous cyclam derivatives. Rate of complexation is the highest for the ligand with the BPi pendants. As expected for cb -cyclam derivatives, the complexes are highly kinetically inert. The phosphonic acid /BPi cb-cyclam derivatives are efficiently radiolabelled with 64 -Cu even at room temperature and sma ll molar excess of the ligands and, thus, with a high specific activity. However, radiolabelling is not efficient if only one phosphorus acid pendant is present in the ligands . Preliminary in -vivo data will be also presented, confirming stability in -vivo.Thus, the ligands seem to be good chelators for copper -based radiopharmaceuticals.

Copper ions are essential for biological function yet lead to severe pathophysiological conditions when dysregulated. A major route by which excess copper ions can affect cell physiology is via the catalytic production of hydroxyl radicals that can irreversibly alter essential bio -molecules. Hence, copper selective chelators that can remove excess copper ions and alleviate oxidative stress will help treat copper dysregulation induced diseases. However, most currently available chelators are non -specific ,leading to numerous undesirable side -effects. The challenge is to build chelators that can bind to copper ions with high affinity but leave the levels of essential metal ions including protein -bound Cu ions and the benign glutathione labile Cu+pool We have developed novel Cu2+selective chelators that exhibit 108times higher conditional stability constants toward Cu2+over Cu+and other biologically relevant metal that access the Cu2+state and relieve metal induced oxidative stress without affecting the essential non - redox cycling labile Cu+pool.Importantly, we show that the chelators can alleviate Cu induced oxidative stress in both Menkes disease model cells ofCu overload and azebrafis h larval model of Cu induced oxidative stress . The distinct selectivity of our chelators indicates potential applicability toward the treatment of severe metabolic and neurological disorders associated with abnormal Cu homeostasis including Wilson's disease, Menkes Disease, Alzheimer's disease, and also some forms of cancer.

These organisms present a thick peptidoglycan wall that was thought to preclude them to perform extracellular electron transfer (i.e. exchange catabolic electrons with solid electron acceptors outside of th e cell). Here we describe the structure and functional mechanisms of the multiheme cytochrome OcwA, the terminal reductase of the Gram -positive and thermophilic bacterium Thermincola potens JR found at the cell surface of this organism. The structure, dete rmined at 2.2\u00c5 resolution shows that the overall -fold and organization of the hemes are not related to other metal reductases, such as MtrC or OmcA, and instead are similar to those of multiheme cytochromes involved in the biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen and sulfur, such as NrfA and HAO. Our data reveal that terminal oxidoreductases of soluble and insoluble substrates are evolutionarily related, providing novel insights into the evolutionary pathway of multiheme cytochromes. They further reveal that OcwA can take the role of a respiratory 'swiss -army knife' allowing Thermincola to grow in environments with rapidly changing availability of terminal electron acceptors without the need for transcriptional regulation and protein synthesis.150 151 ICBIC-19 ICBIC-19 Invited Lectures Invited Lectures Book of Abstracts Book of AbstractsIL-066 Oxygen Activation by C -H breaking in the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Polyamines Coordinated to I ron(III) Martha absence and presence of dioxygen [1, 2] .In this The reaction in dry ethanol , under dinitrogen, startswith the deprotonation of oted by the basic EtO-anion [1]. In the presence of O 2the rate determining step was the reduction of dioxygen to the superoxide anion, O 2-[2]. To obtain further mechanistic insight, we performed density function calculations onthe interaction of O 2and [Fe(III)L3]3+which revealed that O 2induce dthe cleavage of a C -H bond in [Fe(III)L3]3+(Figure). This C -H bond is partially polarized by the nearby Fe(III) center. F urthermore ,a C-H isotope effect was detected upon deuteration of the L3C-Hbond which was cleaved in the oxidative dehydrogenation process [3]. These experimental and computational findings strongly suggest that the dioxygen molecule becomes activated viaahydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism. In this coupled proton/electron transf er both the HOOradical and a carbon centered radical [Fe(III)L3]3+are produced in the first step of the reaction. In this work I will present and discuss a mechanism of O 2activation consistent with the new discoveries in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction of compound 1 .

For molecular imaging purposes with metallic radio nuclides, the bifunctional chelator approach is the common way of combining targeting moieties with an imaging modality. Chelators are often large molecules ,bound to a functionality in the targeting struct ure. This may lead to interference swith the bioactivity, especially for small molecules in which e.g. the molecular weight easily doubles. It would be beneficial, if small biomolecule could be labelled via an integral part of the targeting structure ,without additional bonds to one of the functional groups in the basic molecule . We showed in the past the extraordinary stability of [M( 6-C6R6)2]+(M=Re, 99Tc) type complexes and a way of preparing the corresponding 99mTc complexes, albeit from organic solvents.1-2Aren es or phenyls are ubiquitous in pharmaceuticals and might serve as potential ligand sites due to the water and air stabilities of corresponding [M( 6-C6R6)2]+complexes. The preparation of these sandwich complexes follows Fischer -Hafner conditions, thus, demands the presence of AlCl 3as activator. AlCl 3is however incompatible with many functionalities, which limits the approach. Post -synthetic derivatization of [M(6-C6R6)2]+is tedious and lengthy. ReTcNH OHO OH HN O ReN O N O[99mTcO4]- H2O organic In this presentation, we show that sandwich complexes of the [M( 6-C6R6)2]+type with C 6R6being differently substituted arenes such as paracetamol are directly accessible by substituting naphthalene in [Re(6-C10H8)2]+with the corresponding arene. Furthermore, the homologous 99mTc complexes are directly accessible from an aqueous solution and [99mTcO 4]-in high radiochemical purity and yields depending on the solubilities of the arenes in water . As a perspective, the s ynthetic concept may even be applicable to more complex organic molecules ,which opens a path towards the direct labelling of small molecules with 99mTc without the need of bulky bifunctional chelators.

Upon interaction ,the host protein molecules exhibiting inherent chirality are able to induce asymmetry of achiral organic and coordination compounds, and therefore may cause an appearance of a signal in their CD spectra. These induced CD (ICD) bands are very sensitive to the arrangement of the binding site sof hosting proteins and may reflect both the structural alterations and the conformation transitions of proteins. Various organic compounds and metal complexes have been reported to be ICD probes due to their binding to proteins and sensitivity to their structural alterations. Among them, c age metal complexes =clathrochelates [2] ,have been recently recognized as prospective biological effectors using their three- dimensio nal structure as rigid scaffold for macromolecular binding . Here we will present our recent results on i ron(II) clathrochelates as macrobicyclic cage metal complexes able to form multicentered supramolecular interactions in the vacant cavities or at the surface of protein macromolecules and /or their macromolecular complexes [3-4].

Here, we explore the multifunctionality of members of the subfamily proposed to deliver ZnIIto apoprotein targets under these physiological conditions. In this work, we examine two Zur (zinc -uptake repressor) -regulated COG0523 family pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii (AbZigA) and Staphylococcus aureus (SaZigA), in an effort to develop a model for ZnIImetallochaperone activity. ZnII chelator competition experiments reveal one high affinity ( KZn11010-1011M-1) metal binding site in each GTPase, while AbZigA and SaZigA are characterized by 1- 2additional lower affinity ( KZn2107M-1) metal binding sites .High affinity metal binding at the CXCC (C, Cys; X, any amino acid) motif in the 2 strand4activates the GTPase activity of both enzymes with ZnIImore effective than CoII.Neither enzyme coordinates or is regulated by FeII.Both GTPases bind the product, GDP, more tightly in the apo state than in the ZnII-bound state, and exhibit what is best described as a \"locked\" conformation around the GTP substrate. Negative thermodyna mic linkage is observed between nucleotide binding and metal binding consistent with a new mechanistic model for COG0523 -catalyzed metal delivery.

Solar energy is an inexhaustible energ y source for a sustainable solution to the global energy consumption. The storage of large amounts of light energy can be achieved by conversion into chemical energy saved in biomass. Artificial photosynthesis permits the splitting of water into molecular hydrogen and oxygen and is therefore a very promising strategy to meet the increasing worldwide need for clean energy. This requires the development of high -performance water -reduction and water -oxidation catalysts where the latter is currently the main b ottleneck for efficient photocatalytic water splitting. Detailed analysis of the catalytic functioning and the factors determining the efficiency of catalysts is a prerequisite for the design of more efficient catalysts. We present our recent research for the in -depth study of water splitting catalysis using forefront computational methods . In particular, we go beyond standard computational approaches using very accurate wavefunction -based electronic structure methods as well as high-performance ab initio molecular dynamics . The latter allows for an improved inclusion of solvent and environmental effects at ambient conditions , which have been shown to have a decisive influence on the behaviour of the catalysts, and pav esthe way for highly sophisticated complete free energy surfaces using enhanced sampling methods. In close collaboration with experimental groups, we have recently investigated in detail bio -inspired water oxidation catalysts, which feature a cubane core in analogy to the oxygen- evolving comp lex in nature's photosystem II . Our calculations revealed various factors influencing the water oxidation process and demonstrated certain similarities to nature's oxygen evolving complex. Other projects have dealt with the study of reaction networks and i n silico design of bio -inspired Ru-based water oxidation catalysts or Co-based water reduction catalysts.

Carbon monoxide (CO) has been recognized as a toxic gas because of its greater affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen. However, biological studies have revealed an intriguing role for CO as a molecule with therapeutic pro perties. They have also demonstrated that CO exer cises many cellular activities, including anti -inflammatory activities [1]. As a result, there are a large number of reports on the biological applications of CO -releasing molecules (CORMs) in many diseases [1-3]. Controlled release of CO is critical to avoiding the mishaps of using carbon monoxide in free form. One way to control the release of CO from CORMs is to develop photosensitive substances. The use of graphene oxide as an irradiation converter in chemical energy and CORM transporter allows the photoliberation in regions near infrared (NIR) [4,5] . NIR irradiation penetr ates deeper into human tissue and, at the same time, has less phototoxicity to the body than UV light, making the use of CORMs as promising drugs [4].However, the presence of typical structural defects, system loading, graphene sheet size, degree of aggregation and oxidation are all factors capable of triggeri ng cytotoxicity when cells are exposed to GO [6].Many polymers have been used to functionalize graphene oxide in order to reduce this problem such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyacrylic acid (PAA) and polyetherimide (PEI). The introduction of PEG chains in GO 'ssheets has shown the best results [6]. Thus, the purpose of this research wasthe development of organometallic compounds of manganese (Mn) coupled to functionalized graphene oxide that can be used as photoCORMs under NIR irradiation.

Isc and Suf are the key biosynthesis pathways responsible for generating these Fe -S cluster prosthetic groups in E. coli. While Isc dominates under normal conditions, Suf t akes over during periods of iron depletion and oxidative stress.1,2Sulfur acquisition via these systems relies on the ability to remove sulfur from free cysteine using a cysteine desulfurase mechanism. For the Suf pathway, which is also found in pathogeni c organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis , the dimeric SufS protein serves this purpose using the cofactor pyridoxal -5'-phosphate (PLP) to abstract sulfur from free cysteine production of alanine and persulfide.3For optimal functiona lity, SufS requires the SufE to remove the persulfide and promote turnover.4Previous investigation revealed the steady state kinetics of this process with hydrogen -deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX -MS), demonstrating a half -sites mo del with the two SufS monomers showing distinct qualities for the two PLP active sites.5While cysteine desulfurase activity has been investigated, the mechanism by which this PLP -dependent enzyme operates remains a mystery. Here, we have used site -direct mutagenesis and rapid -mix transient kinetics studies, in conjunction with X -ray crystallography, to analyze the pre- steady state behaviors of this process and define several early mechanistic intermediates in SufS catalytic cycle.6Preliminary results of the kinetic consequences resulting from interaction of SufS with the SufE effector protein will also be discussed.

Precise knowledge of Mg2+binding site properties is vital for our understanding of nucleic acid systems. Unfortunately, the PDB, the main source of Mg2+binding sites, contains a substantial number of assignment issues that blur our understanding of the functions of these ions. Here, we surveyed nucleic acid X -ray structures with resolutions 2.9 \u00c5 to set of \"prior -knowledge\" nucleobase Mg2+binding sites and report that crystallographic examples of trustworthy M g2+binding sites are fewer than expected since many of those are associated with misidentified Na+/K+. We also emphasize that binding of Na+and K+to nucleic acids is much more frequent than anticipated. Overall, we provide evidence derived from X -ray st ructures that nucleobases arepoor inner -sphere binders for good binders for monovalent ions. Based on strict stereochemical criteria, we propose an extended set of guidelines designed to help in the assignment and validation of ions directly contacting nucleobase and ribose atoms. When borderline Mg2+ stereochemistry is observed, alternative placement of Na+, K+,NH 4+,Ca2+or even Zn2+must be considered. Among numerous examples, we describe how the application of simple stereochemical rules helps to question the common Mg2+assignment for the ion located at the rRNA decoding center proximal to G 518and stress the presence of K+. Although, at first glance, such assignment issues seem unimportant, it must be envisaged that the Mg2+stabilizatio n effect is much greater than that of K+.

Antimicr obial resistance (AMR) has emerged as an increasingly serious threat to global public health. It threatens the effective treatment of a range of infections caused by bacteria, parasites, viruses and fungi. Drug resistant bacterial infections lead to incre ased healthcare costs, prolonged hospital stays, treatment failures, and increasingly death. By 2050, drug- resistant bacterial infections are projected to annually cause 390,000 deaths in Europe for example. Furthermore there is a startling lack of new effective antimicrobials being developed and brought to market. Significantly bismuth -containing quadruple therapies for H. pylori represent a successful strategy for overcoming multidrug bacterial resistance [1]. Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical diseas e that is endemic in 98 countries. Approximately 1.3 million new cases of leishmaniasis and 30 thousand leishmaniasis associated deaths are recorded each year. Significantly the incidence of leishmaniasis is increasing due to the failing preventative and therapeutic measures, human migration, global warming and drug resistance [2]. Antimonial -based drugs have been used to treat leishmaniasis since 1910 and are still used in many countries as first choice anti - leishmanial drugs due to their favourable therap eutic indices and relatively low toxicity. Progress in relation to the development and activity of novel (i) bismuth hydroxamato complexes as potential anti -bacterial agents and (ii) antimony hydroxamato /hydroximato complexes as anti agents wil l be reported [3-5].

Replacing the cobalt -center of vitamin B 12 derivatives by other metal ions has been an old challenge for chemists working in the bioinorganic and B 12-fields [1-6]. Removal of the cobalt- ion from intact cobalamins and other corrinoid vitamin B12-derivatives has remained futile [1,5] requiring complex strategies for the preparation of transition metal corrinoids [1, 4 - 6]. Fortunately, the metal -free corrin ligand of vitamin B 12, hydrogenobyric acid, has become available from biosynthesis by engineered bacteria [7]. This metal- free corrin offer s the opportunity to incorporate metal ions chemically and to study the structures and chemical reactivity of the resulting metal -analogues of the cobalt -containing cobyrates. Attachment of the B 12-nucleotide moiety allow s for the direct total synthesis of metbalamins, transition metal -analogues of the cobalamins [4], which are potential B12- mimics, e.g. as 'antivitamins B 12', for use in biological and biomedical experiments [4,8,9]. This lecture will deal with some metal -analogues of natural B12-derivatives, their intricate chemical properties and the special role of the corrin ligand of B 12 in binding transition metal -ions.

The catalytic copper[I] is usually generated in situ by combining a copper[II] salt with a reducing agent. The reduction reaction of copper[II], however, is accompanied by the generation of destructive reactive oxyge n species (ROS), and these lead either to oxidative damage to the biomolecules to be conjugated or cytotoxicity if this reaction is carried out within living cells. A few divergent approaches have been reported to address this intrinsic limitation of CuAAC . The present research reports a catalytic DNA (DNAzyme), isolated by in vitro selection, that catalyses azide- alkyne cycloaddition with ultra-low concentration of copper[I] in cis . What is most interesting is that the DNAzyme also works with low copper[II], such that no extrinsic reducing agent is required. The in trans kinetics show that when copper[II] used as the 'catalytic' metal ion, there is an induction phase where the reaction rate is slow and then gradually accelerates . This striking result suggests that DNAzyme possesses a limited but in -built reductase activity capable of reducing one or more catalytically relevant Cu[II] Cu[I] in situ. When optimized, this DNAzyme will be an excellent addition to the 'click chemistry ' repertoire and will facilitate studies that have been hampered by the limitations of traditional CuAAC.

Mesenchymal cancer cells represent a small fraction of solid tumors at a given time point. Typically, these cells are refractory to conventional therapeutic agents. Furthermore, this cell state has been linked to the developmen t of metastasis and cancer relapse. The complex natural product salinomycin has been shown to selectively kill this population of cells across lineages. It was previously proposed that salinomycin mediates its activity by increasing cellular concentrations of alkali metals such as sodium and potassium. To further illuminate mechanisms underlying the selective activity of salinomycin, we used a combination of synthetic organic chemistry, high -resolution microscopy and molecular biology techniques. In particu lar, we have shown that salinomycin and its synthetic derivatives accumulate in lysosomes and sequester iron in this organelle. As a result, accumulation of iron leads to the production of reactive oxygen species and lysosomal membrane permeabilization, wh ich in turn promotes cell death by means of ferroptosis. These findings revealed the prevalence of iron homeostasis in mesenchymal cancer cells, paving the way towards the development of next -generation therapeutics. Importantly, this work has led to the d iscovery that iron operates as a master regulator of cellular plasticity in the context of cancer [1]. References [1]T. T. Mai, A. Hama\u00ef, A. Hienzsch, T.

There is accumulating evidence for the redox cousin of nitric oxide, nitroxyl (HNO, nitrosyl bi ological systems. Like nitric oxide, HNO is also a biological signaling molecule. Major biological targets of HNO include transition metal centres of proteins , cysteine side chains of proteins and small molecular weight thiols. Furthermore HNO also shows p romise as a therapeutic, particularly in treating heart failure. Identifying the key biochemical mechanisms involving HNO is currently receiving considerable attention. Given that HNO dimerizes rapidly in aqueous solution, molecules which decompose to rele ase HNO (HNO donors) are essential in this emerging field. A major drawback of the currently available HNO donors is the slow rate of HNO release at neutral pH (typically mins to hours). This has prevented us and others from directly determining reaction rates and characterizing intermediates formed for the reactions of HNO with molecules of biological importance. Activation of molecules using light is a highly efficient method to rapidly generate chemical entities upon demand with temporal and spatial control. This talk will focus on the photochemistry of a new class of photoactive HNO donors which combine a (hydroxynaphthalenyl)methyl phototrigger with an -alkoxysulphonamide HNO generator. IL-083 Catalytic of [FeFe] 44801 4Physics Dept., Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, 14195 Berlin, Germany . [FeFe] -hydrogenases are b iological hydrogen (H 2) conversion enzymes with potential for renewable energy applications. The reaction cycle of hydrogen turnover at their catalytic six -iron cofactor , the so - called H-cluster ,is controversially debated. We have proposed a novel reaction scheme that attributes the so-farspectroscopically identified H-cluster states either to catalyti c or regulatory functions (Fig. 1).1 These attributions were based on characterization of the H -cluster states using complementary spectroscopic approaches , including infrared and X -ray spectroscopy, as well as quantum chemical and kinetic simulations. A k ey aspect of the reaction scheme is differential proton -coupled electron transfer that occurs either to the four -iron or diiron sub- complexes of the H -cluster (Fig. 1), which facilitates biasing of the electron localization and redox potential balancing in two sequential cofactor reduction steps as well as rapid H 2turnover due to avoidance of larger ligand rearrangements at the cofactor. Here, the decisive experimental and computational evidence for this reaction scheme is summarized, derived underlying pr inciples of rapid hydrogen turnover in biology are outlined, and possible implications for improvement of synthetic catalysts are discussed .

Herein we report an enzymatic method to synthesiz e DNA strands containing a hydroxypyridone ( H) nucleotide, which forms a CuII-mediated base pair ( H-CuII-H). A two -step (KF exo -and Dpo4 polymerase s)enabled the incorporation of a H nucleotide at a desired internal position [3].The polymerase synthesis was subsequently applied to the development of metal -responsive deoxyribozymes (DNAzymes), whose catalytic activity was expected to be regulated by the formation of a single H-CuII-Hbase pair. A metal -responsive DNAzyme was designed based on the sequence of E5 DNAzyme. The RNA -cleaving DNAzyme activity was reversibly switched by the alternate addition and the removal of CuIIions. Furthermore, metal -dependent orthogonal activation of a CuII-responsive H- DNAzyme and a HgII-responsive T -DNAzyme was experimentally demonstrated. Accordingly, the facile enzymatic synthesis of artificial ligand -bearing DNAs would significantly ex pand the toolbox of DNA - based supramolecular chemistry and DNA nanotechnology [3].

LSD's represent a large number of monogenetic diseases and while rare the prevalence is to hemophilia. Asmonogenetic diseases with clearly defined genotype -phenotype relations, lysosomal storage diseases are excellent candidates for gene therapy. The transformative results documented in an adeno -associated virus (AAV) gene therapy clinical trial in infants affected by spinal muscular atrophy demonstrated unequivocally the potential of in vivo gene transfer to treat monogenic neurological disorder . Todate there is a lack of non -invasive ways to determine biodistribution or activity levels of these AAV thera pies in patients. This is a significant hinderance, leaving investigators guessing which organs or structures are effectively treated and, due to the lag time associated with clinical disease progression, this limitation ultimately impacts the evolution o f treatment modalities. In order to overcome these limitations ,we are developing of a new class of bioresponsive magnetic resonance imaging probes to track enzymatic activity in any organ, peripheral nervous system (PNS), or central nervous system (CNS) over time. Magnetic resonance imaging is an ideal technique for the study of neurological disorders. This technique is has become a gold standard in diagnostic radiology as a result of the absence of ionizing radiation and is capable of true 3D imaging and has been in use for several decades We pioneered the development of bio -responsive MR contrast agents and since then the library of this class of probes has expanded from enzyme activated agents ,pHsensitive ,the detection of ions such as Zn(II) and Ca( II),and redox activated. Here, w e describe the development of a platform where a substrate (blocking access of water to a Gd(III) ion) is removed by an enzyme that can be changed to accommodate a number of gene therapy targets. T1W-TSE, brain pre-contrast T1W-TSE, brain post -contrast IL-087 the covalent modification of bio(macro)molecules , in particular peptides and proteins, are so far mostly a domain of bioorganic chemistry [1,2] . However, introduction of metal - based functionalities also hold great promise for applications in Inorganic Chemical Biology , e.g. by exploration of metal -inherent properties such as rich photophysics, electrochemical bistability, tunable ligand -exchange kinetics, and availability of stable as well as radioactive isotope markers. In that context, our group develops novel chemistry to quickly generate molecular diversity in metal complex - bio(macro)molecule conjugates. Figure 1 (Left) P eriodic table s howing the scope of the iClick reaction and (right) kinetics followed by 1HNMR spectroscopy. Our approach is based on the [3+2] cycloaddition of metal azido complex eswith an alkyne coupling partner directly in the inner metal coordination sphere [3 -5]. A particular highlight is the formation of very robust triazolate linkers under retention of the stereochemistry, without a catalyst, and at room temperature that are stable in aqueou s solution for at least several months, as demonstrated by ESI mass spectrometry. A systematic overview across the d -block elements will be given together with kinetic data, including the trapping of intermediates at low temperature (- 20 \u00b0C), which reveale d 2ndorder rate constants comparable to the Staudinger ligation reaction well -established in bioorganic chemistry [ 3-5].

Kinetic 19F NMR spectroscopy revealed unexpected intermediates (Figure 1 right) and allowed the clear elaboration of trends with regard to the nature of the metal center and alkyne involved.

DNA has become very attractive as scaffold for functional molecules on the nanometre scale. The sequence specific insertion of modified nucleotides using automated DNA synthesis allows for the creati on of designer molecules with a wide range of potential applications. We have established a general synthetic route to porphyrin -nucleosides and their subsequent site -specific create multi- porphyrin arrays [1].The porphyrin modified DNA is now being used in several applications, spanning optics, electronics, medicinal chemistry and sensors. We will present our latest research in these fields with several selected examples (see Figure): a)Currently, we are creating a new multi- porphyrin based light pipe which is bio- templated using protein -DNA interactions (RecA), yielding an efficient energy transfer system over a distance of >15 nm. b)In addition to their photophysical properties, porphyrins are very hydroph obic; we made use of this property to anchor DNA stably into lipid bilayers. In this way, we could create a nano -pore consisting of six DNA helix bundles, where the central cavity of around 2 nm diameter leads to an ionic current [2]. Going small, a DNA du plex with six porphyrins inserted equally well into the membrane, and ionic currents can be observed due to leakage of ions along the DNA. This gives rise to the smallest possible DNA based nano pore [3]. c) The electrochemical properties of the porphyrins are perfect to create genosensors to detect complementary DNA strands of biological and medicinal relevance. We have made both single and multiplex sensors, including microfluidic devices, exploring different designs in the sensor strands [4,5]. DNA sequ ences related to H5N1 avian flu virus and to bladder cancer can be detected down to the atto - molar concentration, which approaches single molecule detection. S elf-assembled porphyrazine systems can be used in sizing forensic short tandem repeat sequences b y simple fluorescence readout [6]. References Res. 823- 831. [2]J. R. Burns, K. G\u00f6pfrich, J.

IL-089 Medicinal Chemistry complexes have recently attracted mayor attention in inorganic medicinal chemistry based on their high cytotoxic activities and their multiple pharmacological effects against tumor cell proliferation. [1,2] The enhanced stability of their metal -carbon bonds has also been a driving argument regarding the design of potent gold metallodrugs with an improved stability under physiological conditions. We and many other groups have recently reported on biscarbene gold(I) complexes with two N- heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands ([Au(I)(NHC) 2]+complexes, see figure for an example) and their potential as anticancer agents. [3-6]The complexes generally triggered high cytotoxic activities, displayed an efficient cellular uptake, and were good inhibitors of the selenoenzyme thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). Other relevant pharmacological effects ,such as antimitochondrial properties ,could be confirmed additionally .More recently we have developed structurally related neutral biscarbene compl exes of the type alkynylAu (I)(NHC). In this presentation our most relevant current and previous findings on the medicinal chemistry of gold(I) biscarbene species will be summarised with a focus on important early preclinical parameters such as structure -activity -relationships, stability, protein binding ,or cellular uptake.

R. China. This lecture will present a personal story of a 3x cancer survivor and how with the assistance of great coworkers and collaborators an effort has been made to fight back against this disease by studying the chemistry and anti -cancer biology of texaphyrins and, more recently, gold- carbene redox active systems. Texaphyrins are a specific class of expanded porphyrin (a term we introduced into the literature in 1988 to describe larger homologues of n atural blood pigments) that form stable 1:1 with trivalent lanthanide cations, such as Gd(III) and Lu(III). The parent form of the texaphyrins were the founding technology for Pharmacyclics, a company that ultimately developed Imbruvica\u00ae(a coval ent BTK inhibitor) before being acquired by AbbVie in 2015. Building on early clinical studies at Pharmacyclics, efforts in the PI's laboratory and that of collaborators have focused on developing Pt(IV) conjugates of texaphyrins as possible drug leads in overcoming platinum resistant colon and ovarian cancer. More recently explorations involving gold -based carbenes have led to the discovery of a set of compounds designed to act as dual targeting agents on the mechanistic level. These agents serve as trigg ers of immunogenic cell death and show promise as possible cancer vaccines. These parallel drug discovery efforts will be the subject of this presentation.

Some metal -dithiocarbamato complexes have shown outstanding in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity together with negligible systemic and organ toxicity (owing to the intrinsic chemoprotective function of the coordina ted dithiocarbamato moiety), although selective tumor targeting is still a major issue.[1] In order to maximize impact on cancer cells and minimize side- effects, our approach relies on the conjugation of biologically -active molecules to potential metallodr ugs. In particular, we aim at designing \"Trojan Horse\" -type complexes characterized by an improved selectivity provided by selected coordinated ligands targeting specific receptors overexpressed in cancer cells, so as to achieve biomolecular recognition an d tumor targeting. [2] Rapidly dividing tumor cells require higher amounts of nutrients and energy for their fast proliferation, and glucose is no exception (the so -called \"Warburg effect\"). Consequently, such increased demand of glucose by cancer cells mak es it very attractive to selectively target tumor sites. In particular, tailored glucose -like substrates can be conjugated to chemotherapeutics (including metal -containing anticancer agents) to attain the site -specific delivery of drugs into the affected t issues.[3] Accordingly, we have been focusing on the design of metal -dithiocarbamato glycoconjugates which cancombine the antitumor properties and the favorable toxicological profile of the metal -dithiocarbamato scaffold,[1] along with an improved selecti vity and cellular uptake provided by the glucose -containing ligands coordinated to the metal center, through the exploitation of the glucose -mediated cellular internalization provided by glucose transporters (GLUTs).[4] With a view to developing more effic ient strategies to the functionalization of metallodrugs with carbohydrates, we here report on an innovative and efficient synthetic route to generate metal - dithiocarbamato glycoconjugates (including Au(I), Au(III), Pt(II) and Mn(I) derivatives) in high yi elds and purity.[5] Starting from the rationale behind our research work, the main results and preliminary in vitro biological studies are illustrated and discussed.

Heme is a likely playe r in the postulated RNA world. Heme -bound nucleic acids have been shown to recapitulate at least two of the known catalytic functions of contemporary hemoproteins, lending credence to heme's link to a primordial RNA world [2]. Hence, the heme -bound nucleic acids could be regarded as prototypes for redox -catalyzing ribozymes in the primordial RNA world. We found that heme binds selectively to the 3' -terminal G -quartet of parallel- telomere related sequences , a pi -pi stacking interaction between the porphyrin moiety of the heme and the G -quartet, to form 1:1 complexes which exhibit peroxidase activities [3]. In the complexes, a water molecule (H 2O) at the interface between t he heme and G -quartet is coordinated to the heme Fe atom as an axial ligand [4], and possibly acts as an electron -donating ligan d that promotes heterolytic peroxide bond cleavage of hydrogen peroxide bound to the heme Fe atom, trans to the H 2O, for the generation of an active species . Unique physicochemical properties of the H 2O in the complex [5], together with the peroxidase catalytic cycle of the complex, are discussed.

We have tried to unveil the molecular mechanism s of a few representative gold compounds with the aid of different investigative approaches. Proteomic methods are particularly effective in disclosing drug induced cellular events opening new horizons in the fields of drug discovery and drug delivery. This type of approach has been applied to 6 structurally diverse gold compounds - both gold(I) and (III) complexes - and to the clinically established gold(I) drug Auranofin in A2780 ovarian cancer cells . Proteins differentially expressed upon treatment were identified through 2D gel electrophoresis and MALDI TOF determinations and their meaning tentatively interpreted. A variety of proteomic alterations were observed for the investigat ed gold compounds in strict relation to the ir chemical nature suggesting the occurrence of different mode s of action . The cellular processes mostly affected by gold compounds were identified in the various cases. Additional information was obtained by developing a cancer cell line showing acquired resistance to Auranofin. Subsequently, some structure -function relationships were drawn by analyzing the cell ular effect s of a panel of metal compounds that closely repro duce the main chemical features of AF . Overall, these studies underscore the large amount of mechanistic information that may be gained by applying a variety of investigative methods at the cellular level. Perspectives for future work are delineated . References [1] S. Nobili, E. Mini, I. Landini, C. Gabbiani, A. Casini, L. Messori, Medicinal Research Reviews 30, 2010, 550- 580. [2] I.

The Wood -Ljungdahl Pathway (WLP) allows diverse classes of anaerobic microbes to remove and fix CO 2and CO from the atmosphere. Acetogenic bacteria also couple CO 2reduction to H 2oxidation in this pathway as their main source of ATP and reducing equivalents. The major enzyme within this pathway is acetyl -CoA synthase (ACS), part of an enzyme complex contains CO dehydrogenase (CODH). CODH catalyzes CO 2reduction to CO, wh ich travels through a tunnel to the active site A -Cluster of ACS, where CO is condensed with coenzyme A and a methyl group donated by the corrinoid iron -sulfur protein (CFeSP) to form acetyl -CoA. In 1985, the WLP pathway was proposed to involve a series of Ni- based organometallic intermediates (1). The A -cluster is composed of an unusual di -nickel center bridged to an [4Fe -4S] cluster, where the proximal Ni (Ni p) forms the bridge between the [4Fe -4S] cluster and the distal Ni (Ni d). Ni dis the site of CO binding (2) and is proposed also to bind the methyl group and CoA . Photolysis and crystallographic experiments indicated that a hydrophobic alcove directs CO to and keeps CO near the A -cluster (3, 4). To understand the role of Ni and of the alcove in substr ate binding, a residue, which forms a wall of the alcove was substituted with alanine (F229A). Using infrared (IR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and X -ray absorption (XAS) spectroscopies and kinetic analyses, F229A was shown to disrupt acetyl -CoA synthesis and binding of CO, while methylation and A -cluster composition remain intact. We propose the alcove plays an essential structural role in the ACS mechanism by binding and retaining CO near Ni pto facilitate formation of the key Ni p(I)-CO, methyl -Ni and acetyl -Ni intermediates in the WLP of acetyl -CoA synthesis. We also propose an essential role of chemical coupling to electron transfer in forming the active Ni p(I) species in the WLP. Financial support by NIH (GM39451) is gratefully acknowledged.

Earth was irreversibly changed by the evo lution of oxygenic photosynthesis and the rise of atmospheric oxygen in the Great Oxygenation Event (GOE). Life on Earth today uses manganese both for dioxygen product ioninoxygenic photosynthesis and for protection from deleterious oxidation reactions. The catalytic Mn 4CaO 5cluster at the heart of photosystem II is an evolutionary singularity: oxygenic photosynthesis evolved only once, and the same chemistry is used by all known oxygenic photosynthetic organisms, from microbes to plants. In extant organi sms,Mn(II) plays a n essential role in protecting cells from oxidative stress, not only as a cofactor in antioxidant proteins such as superoxide dismutase and catalase but also in the form of small -molecule inorganic complexes. Prior to the GOE ,~ 2.35 bil lion years ago, there would have been no evolutionary pressure to develop antioxidant proteins, so pre -GOE life must have depended entirely on inorganic chemistry for protection from oxidation. In order to gain insights into the chemistry of these ancient processes, we have been studying manganese speciation in a variety of extant Cyanobacteria ( e.g., sp. PCC6803). I n modern Synechocystis , cellular Mn(II) concentrations are vastly higher than expected based on proteomic requirements, suggesting a continuing role for Mn(II) in antioxidant biology. We are using a combination of fluorescence, magnetic resonance (EPR/ENDOR), XANES, and mass spectrometric techniques to examine manganese concentration, oxidation stat e, ligand environment, and localization in whole Cyanobacterial cells, providing insights into Mn biogeochemical cycling today and on the early Earth.186 187 ICBIC-19 ICBIC-19 Invited Lectures Invited Lectures Book of Abstracts Book of AbstractsIL-102 Insight into Non -Covalent I nteractions of Biological A ctive C opper Complexes and Relevance been interested into transition metal coordination compounds of imidazole and benzimidazole derivatives with biological properties [1 -2].

With a family of amino acid and peptide derived Rh- bis(diphosphine) complexes, we see orders of magnitude differences in rate for certain complexes. Data are consist ent with modifications which appear to influence CO 2addition, as well as modifying the rate by influencing the p Kaof the pendant amine. Results also show that a modification of the rate limiting step modulates the effect of the scaffold. The clear and s ignificant impact of the outer coordination sphere indicates that it is applicable to many catalysts for small molecule conversion, and provides a platform to understand the role of the scaffold for both enzymatic and synthetic systems.

Based on the redox behavior of a series of thiolate and thiocarboxylate bridged diiron(II) complexes, [5] we have developed an unique synthetic strategy for the synthesis of such an unprecedented mononitrosyl diiron(II) complex [6] and its dinitrosyl ana and di -nitrosyl diiron(II) complexes produce N2Oupon chemical as well as electrochemical reduction in nearly quantitative yields and thus qualify as the functional models for the two key intermediates of FNORs. Based on the spectroscopic studies, measurement of N 2O yields and the first ever isolation of the end products after N 2O generation, i t has been e stablished that while the mononitrosyl diiron(II) complex produces N 2O following a n intermolecular superreduced mechanism, the dinitrosyl diiron(II) complex generates N 2O following a n intramolecular semireduced mechanism.

Due to their high biological activity, Thiosemicarbazones (TSC) are promising candidates in the development of anticancer therapy. Part o f their effectivity arises from their ability to chelate metal ions , such as copper and iron, essential for organisms and cells .Triapine , the best studied anticancer TSC, was already tested in several clinical phase I and II trials with promising results against hematological diseases. During the last years, tw onovel TSCs (DpC and Coti -2) entered clinical trials. This subclass of TSC swithmuch higher anticancer activity was found to exhibit a n additional mode -of-action compared to the less active Triapine. One characteristic is their ability to induce anovel form of programmed cell death, paraptosis, which is characterized by the formation of cytoplasmic vesicle s originating from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), caspase -independent signaling and mitochondrial damage. The aim of this study was to identify structural and chemical properties associated with paraptosis induction of TSCs. For this purpose, a panel of structurally related TSCs was tested for their Cu(II) complex reduction stability. Strikingly , TSCs with higher anticancer potential and paraptosis- inducing properties, showed higher complex stability, a slo wer reduction rate by L-glutathione ,and consequently less efficient re-oxidation and superoxide generation .Consequently, we hypothesize that only very stable, weakly reducible Cu(II) TSC complexes are able to reach the ER, where they inhibit the protein disul fide isomerase (PDI), an ER -resident protein responsible for the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bonds . Subsequently, this leads to deregulation of the ER thiol homeostasis and paraptosis induction. 190 191 ICBIC-19 ICBIC-19 Invited Lectures Invited Lectures Book of Abstracts Book of AbstractsIL-106 Using Protein Scaffolds to Control the Reactivity of Molecular Catalysts for CO 2 Hydrogenation Molly Box 999 Richland, WA 99352, USA. 2Current Address : Montana State University. P.O. Box 173400 Bozeman, MT 59717, USA. The hydrogenation of CO 2 to formate is an attractive vehicle for energy storage because of th e energy density of formic acid . Efficient catalysts for CO 2 hydrogenation are needed for the generation of this fuel. For efficient catalysis to occur, there needs to be efficient interactions between the hydride donor, i.e. metal -hydride catalyst, and hydride acceptor, i.e. the CO 2 substrate. We have investigated using a protein scaffold to help facilitate this interaction. We immobilized a rhodium bisdiphospine complex within a homo -dimeric protein scaffold, LmrR native to Lactococcus lactis .1 Covalent -MS, ICP High pressure Operando NMR spectroscopy measure in situ formate production by Rh -LmrR under 34 atm of CO 2:H2 (1:1) at varying temperatures in an aqueous solution. The metalloenzyme is most active at room temperature and displayed a turnover frequency of 0.38 \u00b10.03 h-1 at 58 atm and 298 K, and achieved an average turnover number of 14 \u00b1 3. Proposed catalytic intermediates generated and characterized suggest the protein scaffold enables catalysis by facilitating the interaction between CO 2 and the hydride donor intermediate. In contrast , the [Rh(PNglyP)2]+ complex without the protein scaffold is not a catalyst for formate production under identical conditions. Mutagenesis studies are currently under investigation to understand how the protein scaffold imparts catalytic activity. References [1] J. Bos, G. Roelfes, Cur r Opin Chem Biol 2014, 19, 135.

Harrop1 1Department of Chemistry and Center for Metalloenzyme Studies, The University of Georgia, 140 Cedar Street, Athens, Georgia, U.S.A., 30602. Nitrogen is an essential element for all forms of life on this planet. As such, nature has evolved metalloenzymes to utilize the N 2present in the atmosphere and convert it to more bioavailable forms such as ammonia. This process and the chemical reactions transforming inorganic N -containing small molecules in general, is part of the Global Nitrogen Cycle (GNC). The GNC describes the conversions of all environmentally -relevant N -containing speci es on this planet including nitrate (NO 3), nitrite (NO 2), nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N 2O), etc. where Fe- containing enzymes play a central role. Attention in the chemical transformations of select nitrogen oxides (NO x) has heightened due to the overuse of nitrogen- rich fertilizers, which has increased the concentration of NO 3and NO 2to toxic levels in water runoff. Additionally, other work emphasizes the role of NO 2as a reservoir of NO for mammals under hypoxic conditions. Indeed, NO xcompounds participate in a wide range of biological processes. Of interest to our group is the metal -promoted reduction of NO 2to produce NO (and eventually NH 3) as well as the construction of metal -bound nitroxyl (NOor HNO) coordination complexes. This talk describes our efforts in understanding the fundamental bioinorganic chemistry of NO xreduction mediated by non- porphyrin Fe and Co systems [1-6].

In 1929, F orestier identified the utility of gold in the treatment of rheumat oid arthritis (RA) ;later, the well-known orally active gold (I)-phosphine -thiolate complex, A uranofin, was developed to treat RA in a clinical setting [1].Going beyond the use for RA, there hav erecently been extensive studies on the therapeutic applications of gold complexes as anticancer agents [2,3]. Most previously reported antican cer gold(I) complexes contain a thiolate group and/or a phosphine ligand but the NHC li gand has emerged as a promising ligand [4] .Also silver(I)- NHC systems have been tested, and recent reports underline an antitumor activity comparable and in some cases greater than that of gold carbenes [5].

Iron-sulfur clusters are common to the most ancient components of living matter. Although the importance of proteins bearing [Fe- S] cofactors has been recognized in electron transfer and in catalysis for several decades, there has been growing interest in Fe -S protei ns in recent years with the discovery of their regulatory roles found in bacteria to humans. The common theme in the regulatory activity of Fe -S proteins appears to be that the [Fe -S] clusters respond to specific oxidants such as molecular oxygen, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide. We have prepared discrete [2Fe- 2S] and [4Fe -4S] complexes to study how [Fe-S] cofactors can be modified and/or assembled by redox signalling molecules including nitric oxide, superoxide, disulphide, and protons.1The natu re of products produced from such reactions are largely dependent on the reaction environment. Upon exposure to NO in the presence of thiols, [Fe -S] clusters generate another signalling molecule H 2S with a concomitant formation of dinitrosyl iron complexes (DNICs) or Roussin's red esters (RREs).

Complex metalloenzymes based on iron -sulfur clusters support the conversion of gaseous substrates. Several of the catalyzed reactions are reductions attractive for energy conversion and conservation, such as the reduction of protons, carbon dioxide and dinitrogen. When the reducing power of physiological electrons are not enough the achieve these conversions, electron may be energized beyond the physiological window by coupling ATP -hydrolysis to electron transfer against a redox potential gradient. We study the mechanisms of two classes of electron -transferring ATPases, (I) reducing Co(II) to Co(I), called reductive activators of corrinoid -type enzymes (RACE proteins) [1,2] and (II) reducing low- potential iron -sulfur clusters, catalyzed ASKHA- type electron transf erring ATPases Archerases [3]. We have recently discovered a novel cofactor associated with the Archerase class of electron transferring ATPase. The cofactor is formed by bridging two cubane- type [Fe 4S4]-clusters a requires an electron -transferring ATPase as electron donor and was found capable of reducing acetylene and hydrazine, thus resembling nitrogenases in cofactor structure and reactivity.

In the case of [FeFe] hydrogenase the reaction occurs at the H -cluster, which contains an organometallic dinuclear [2Fe] subsite. Synthetic chemistry has long been a powerful too l in studies of this cluster via the preparation of biomimetic model compounds, and in 2013 it was shown how such synthetic complexes can be introduced into the enzyme itself under in vitro conditions .[1, 2] This provides a direct link between biomimetic chemistry and biology, and allows us to manipulate the enzyme using synthetic chemistry.

R. China. cesmzw@mail.sysu.edu.cn Cisplatin and its successive analogues mainly exert their activities by causing DNA damage and induce apoptosis in cancer cells. With the development of molecular oncology, biomolecule -targeted anticancer strategies have become the mainstream in the search of new cancer drugs. At the biomolecular rapamycin (mTOR) have drawn attention as promising anti -cancer targets. We have developed a series of self -assembled Pt(II) complexes, acting as selective and effective human telomeric G-4 binders and stabilizing certain signif icant and higher anti -tumor efficacy than cisplatin. We have also focused on the rational design of non- platinum metal complexes acting as enzyme inhibitors, investigated their anti - cancer mechanisms in details and their capability to induce cancer cells apoptosis, para apoptosis, autophagy and cell cycle arrest. Recently, we have a lot of interest in the organelle- targeted multifunctional metallo -anticancer agents. The organelle targets that we investigate mainly include mitochondria, lysosome and nucleus. These metallo -anticaner agents possess excellent phosphorescent properties, allowing the real -time tracking of the morphological, behavioral, and micro- environmental changes in the organelles at the same time as treatment an d exhibiting great theranostic potential. To further improve the therapeutic efficacy of metallodrugs, design and development of nanostructured materials is a promising strategy, in which the nanostructure is fabricated by metal complex directed self - assem bly or simply functionalized with metallodrugs as anti -cancer agents, thus realizing multimode synergetic therapy. The anticancer properties and the theranostic potential of these nanomaterials and their in vivo anticancer properties have been explored in details for further biomedical applications [1-5].

The cluster. Sv RsrR plays a primary role in regulating the relative concentrations of NADH and NAD(P) in the cell. It also regulates the synthesis of mycothiol, which is the equivalent of glutathione in Actinobacteria. Electrophoretic mo bility shift assays have shown hat between and +1 to cognate promoter DNA sequences [1]. In order to help understanding how a simple one electron redox process can generate the conformational changes necessary to activate or abolish DNA -binding w e have initiated a series of high resolution crystal structure determinations of the Sv RsrR dimer [2]. A first observation is that the [2Fe -2S] cluster is asymmetrically coordinated across the SvRsrR m onomer -monomer interface by two Cys residues from one subunit and His and Glu residues from the other. This is the first example of a [Fe -S] cluster with three different amino acid side chains as ligands, and of Glu acting as ligand to a [2Fe- 2S] cluster. In addition, we have found that depending on the crystal symmetry and redox state of Sv RsrR, Trp9 can adopt two conformations, one exposed to the solvent medium and the other buried in a pre- existing protein cavity not far from the [2Fe -2S] cluster . This c onformational change results in a significant shift in the DNA -binding helix- turn- helix region of SvRsrR, which may be significant in modulating DNA binding. Indeed, our v ery recent chemical modification studies have confirmed that the Trp9 conformation is redox -dependent. We are also in the process of characterizing this change using molecular dynamics calculations. Latest results will be reported at the Conference.

Well -defined paths driven by electric gradients established across differenta areas of the cage direct iron ions from the bulk solution towards the ferro xidase and nucleation centers [1,2] .Along these paths, several transient iron binding sites with peculiar coordination properties are detected. The use of ferritin as acarrier for targeted cellular delivery is pursued by encapsulating different inorganic species and exploiting the selective ability of cells to internalize ferritin cages rich in L- or H - subunits through specific receptors; the SCARA5 (Scavenger receptor class A type 5) for L -rich cages and TfR1 (Transferrin receptor 1) for H -rich cages .We have observed a significant cytotoxicity associated to iron -loaded ,recombinant, human H ferritin uptaken by HeLa cells via the Tfr1 receptors and internalized via endocytosis [3]. The process causes release of iron that results cyt otoxic .Apool of non- biomineralized iron ions at ( and accessory )sites of H -ferritin subunits ,which is labile at the low endosomal pH, is probably at the basis of the effect.

Energy -transducing respiratory complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is one of the largest and most complicated enzymes in mam malian cells and its mechanism is not well understood [1]. In particular, the key step of how electron transfer is coupled to proton translocation across the membrane - the 'energy coup ling mechanism' -is unknown. Our work is focused on using electron par amagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to interrogate mechanistically -relevant redox c I in detail. We used hyperfine EPR spectroscopic methods, combined with site- directed mutagenesis, to determine the mechanism of a single proton -coupled electron transfer reaction at one of eight iron -sulfur clusters in complex I, [4Fe -4S] cluster N2 ,the electron donor to ubiquinone. Beca use of its position and pH-dependent reduction potential, N2 has long been considered a candidate for the elusive \"energy - coupling\" site in complex I. Using HYS CORE spectroscopy we have show nthat a conserved histidine is hydrogen- bonded to N2, tuning its red uction potential. However, the two are not coupled sufficiently strongly to catalyze a stoichiometric and efficient energy transduction reacti on. We thus exclude cluster N2 as the energy- coupling site in complex I. Our work demonstrates the capability o f pulse EPR methods for providing detailed information on the properties of individual protons in even the most challengi ng of energy -converting enzymes [2]. Having established that cluster N2 is not directly involved in proton translocation, our recent work has focused on understanding the role of ubiquinone (Q10) .Despite mounting evidence ,primarily from computational work, that the energy -coupling step is driven at the Q10site,Q10binding, dissociation and semiquinone (SQ) intermediates are difficul tto investigate experimentally. We have used a yet - unexplored method of constructing a chime ric respiratory chain using submitochondrial par ticles (inverted membrane vesicl es)and an alternative terminal ubiquinol oxidase to circumvent the misleading effects of soluble quinone analogue sto investigate SQ stabilisation during NADH oxidation. Targeted inhibition of individual components of the respiratory chain whilst maintaining complex I turnover , in conjunction with EPR spectroscopy, shows that (i) the dominant SQ radical stabilised in SMPs during NADH:O 2turnover originate sfrom complex I II, (ii) significant contributions arise from off -pathway radicals , (iii) complex I SQ accumulates only transiently [3].The implications on the energy -coupling mechanism incomplex I are discussed .

Urease is most efficient enzyme known, with a rate enhancement of 1015.It was the first enzyme crystallized and proven be proteinaceous in nature, and it was the first enzyme established to depend on the presence of Ni as an essential element .Urease catalyses the decomposition of urea by two hydrolytic stages: the first, which is strictly enzymatic, produces ammonia and carbamate, while the second involves the unc atalyzed spontaneous decomposition of carbamate to yield another molecule of ammonia and bicarbonate. Urease contains a dinuclear cluster of Ni (II)ions in the active site thatcauses the formation of a hydroxide ion acting as the co -substrate necessary for the hydrolytic reaction of urea, at near neutral pH, where the enzyme has its maximal activity [1].The reaction causes a rapid pH increase, with negative consequences for both human health and the environment .The develo pment of urease inhibitors requires knowledge of all steps of the catalytic mechanism at the molecular level. The crystallographic structure determination of the Ni (II)coordination environment in native urease revealed the molecular framework for the catalytic process ,while the structures of several enzyme- inhibitor complexes uncovered the reactivity of the enzyme towards several classes of inhibitors .These structures led to the mechanistic proposal that the Ni -bridging hydroxide acts as the nucleophile in the reaction, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a urea molecule proposed to chelate the two Ni (II)ions [2]. This proposal was alternative to other hypotheses for the catalytic mechanism , which involve da urea molecule terminally bound to Ni(1) through its carbonyl O atom, attacked either by a hydroxide ion terminally bound to Ni(2) [3] or by the bridging hydroxide [4];a third alternative mechanism, based on biomimetic chemistry [5] or computational methods [6], proposed the occurrence of an elimination reaction to form cyanate, an intermediate that, however, has never been observed in urease -catalysed reactions . This controversy would be solved only through the determination of the structure of the enz yme- substrate complex; however, the very short lifetime of the urease- urea adduct ( ca.20 \u00b5s) has so far hampered the determination of its structure. Th is talk will describe and discuss the determination of the high-resolution (1.42 \u00c5 ) structure of the ure ase-urea complex, in which the hydroxide acting as the co - substrate for the reaction has been substituted with an unreactive fluoride, known to inhibit the enzyme by substituting Ni -bound solvent -derived O atoms thus preventing all subsequent catalytic ste ps from occurring [7,8].The structure reveals the chelating mode of urea binding to the two Ni (II)ions, using both the O atom and the NH 2group, which renders the central C atom of urea electron -deficient and poised to undergo the nucleophilic attack by the Ni -bridging hydroxide present in the resting state of the enzyme. The structure sheds light on the initial step of the catalytic mechanism of this paradigmatic metalloenzyme, and resolves the long -standing debate concerning the mechanism of the nickel -driven hydrolysis of urea.

Characteristic sharp emission bands of lanthanide(III) ions in the UV, visible and near -infrared ranges make them attractive for a broad variety of applications in materials science and biology. However, the design of highly luminescent lanthanide(III) -based compounds requires the optimization of the sensitization processes as well as the minimization of non -radiative deactivation mechanism sof luminescent lanthanide (III) ions. We have demonstrated that the emission of lanthanide(III) ions, particularly in the near -infrared range, ZnII/LnIIIand GaIII/LnIIIfamilies of [1 the of ZnII/LnIIIMCs for the labelling of cell necrosis [4] or for the simultaneous cell fixation and counter staining [5] have been envisaged.

Since cancer was identified as one of the leading causes of human death, scientists and researchers worldwide have been motivated by the urgency to find a cure for this disease. By virtue of its role as both the power plant and apoptosis center of cells, the mitochondrion has become an ideal target for anticancer agents. Mitochondria -targeted anticancer drugs that act through disrupting the redox homeostasis of the cell, which leads to the activation of the mitochondrial- dependent cell death signaling pathway, may overcome cancer resistance. Therefore, apoptosis can be triggered efficiently with excess oxidative st ress by targeting mitochondria. In this regard, rationally designed anticancer agent s that target mitochondria are highly sought. Recently we have focused on Ru(II)/Ir(III) polypyridyl complexes which were found to be excellent candidates owing to their attractive photophysical properties (i.e. high water solubility, large 2, high 3O2production, long luminescence lifetime, and excellent chemical -and photo- stability) .Our results indicated that these complexes may be considered to be an efficient anticancer candidate.

P1B-type ion pum ps constitute a key transmembrane transport system for the selective translocation of essential and toxic transition metal ions across the cell membranes in all the domains of life1,2.These primary active transporters exploit the energy from ATP hydrolysis to catalyze ion transport across membranes against their electrochemical gradients. A multidisciplinary structural, biophysical and biochemical strategy is applied to reveal the molecular principles underlying metal substrate selectivity and to address how the energy stored in ATP is transduced into the vectorial flux of specific metal ions across the lipid bilayers3,4. We have investigated the principles controlling metal substrate recognition in a Zn2+/Cd2+/Hg2+/Pb2+ ATPase (ZntA) to reveal the coordination chemistry that define a unique yet promiscuous metal selectivity towards first- ,second -andthird -row transition and post -transition metals.

It is thus essential to know where the metal ions are bound in the three- dimensional fold of the biomolecule. We devised a method by which paramagnetic metal ions can be localized in analogy to the geo positioning system. Spin labels functioning as the satellites are attached site specifically to the biomolecule, the distances between the labels and the metal center are measured by E PR and the site of the metal ion is determined by trilateration. The type of EPR method one should use for the distance measurements depends on the type of metal ion. For electron spin S = 1/2 ions like Cu(II) Pulsed Electron -Electron Double Resonance (PEL DOR or DEER) is very useful, whereas for ions with broad spectral width and/or fast relation times like e.g. low -spin Fe(III), Relaxation Induced Dipolar Relaxation (RIDME) is the better method. For the case of high -spin metal ions, we will show on model systems: 1) that a large zero -field splitting changes the usually axial dipolar spectrum to an orthorhombic one, 2) that such a spectrum can be recorded by RIDME and 3) how to analyze such a spectrum. Last but not least the method is applied to the high -spin Fe(III) ion in myoglobin. Financial support by the DFG within SFB 813, project A6 is gratefully acknowledged.

For biological research and medical diagnostic, optical imaging is an increasingly attractive tool for in vitro and in vivo biological imaging due to the high sensitivity of detection, versatility, low cost of instrument sand high resolution at the cellular level. A common characteristic of biologic sys tems is the presence of complex matrices such as blood, cells, tissue and organs. These matrices emit a significant background fluorescence in the visible domain(autofluorescence), strongly limiting the sensitivity of detection. The luminescence of lanthan ide cations possesses several complementary advantages over the fluorescence of organic fluorophores and semiconductor nanocrystals, such as sharp emission bands for spectral discrimination from background emission, long luminescence lifetimes for temporal discrimination and strong resistance to photobleaching. Several lanthanide cations emit near -infrared (NIR) photons which resul t in improved detection sensitivity due to the absence of native NIR emission from tissues and cells (autofluorescence). In addition, NIR photons can potentially cross tissues for non -invasive imaging and diagnostic. [1] The keyrequirement to take advantage of lanthanide emission is to sensitize them with appropriate chromophores (\"antenna effect\"). We will present here s everal complementary NIR emitting systems with increasing sizes associated with their applications for biologic imaging :1) small monometallic complex esthat possess excitation and emission wavelengths within biological diagnostic window , 2) macromolecular metallacrowns possessing high quantum yields [2-4]and 3) nanoMOFs with high density of lanthanide emitters and sensitizers per unit volume.

Platinum complexes, cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin, are the most widely used anticancer drugs. However, these DNA -targeting treatments are a low selectivity approach with deleterious consequences and a high incidence of resist ance. The societal need for new anti -cancer drugs is very substantial, hence, the commercial demand for new anti -cancer agents is very high.1Although targeted chemotherapeutics with novel mechanisms of action (for example kinase inhibitors) have been developed more recently, these often have a much narrower clinical utility than platinum -based drugs and generally suffer from rapid onset of res istance, which means that there is still a large unmet clinical need. Hence ,there is a wide interest in new metal- based drugs with alternative mechanisms of action. The chemical scaffold offered by metal -based complexes has significant scope for molecular diversity and has the possibility of accessing chemical reactions beyond reach of organic molecules alone (e.g. Fenton- like reactions and single electron transfers) . Furthermore, these complexes could effectively be harnessed to target the redox balance in cancer cells and induce both oxidative and reductive stress, perturbing the cellular balance of reactive oxygen species.2,3Cancer cells are primed for this intervention, because they are already redox -hyperactive and in most cases present malfunctioning mitochondria. Dysfunctional mitochondria are unable to control ROS generation efficiently. This allows metal -based complexes, to exert selective toxicity towards cancer cells over normal cells. The design of such drugs is relatively unexplored and, even more so, is their MoA at cellular level. In this field transition metal complexes have been heavily investigated, par ticularly half -sandwich or 'piano -stool' complexes.4-6This describes three families of Ruthenium organometallic complexes which include in their structures a p-cymene arene unit and modifications in the N,N-chelating ligand . The novel complexes have been physically characterised by means of 2D - Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Mass Spectrometry (MS), single crystal X -Rays diffraction voltammetry. Their relative hydrophobicity and reactivity under biologically relevant conditions has also been investigated using Ultraviolet and Visible spectro scopy (UV -Vis) and reverse phase HPLC. These complexes exhibit potent anticancer activity towards ovarian, colorectal and lung carcinoma. The mechanism of action of such complexes has been investigated paying particular attention to their effect on cell cy cle, induction of apoptosis, and most importantly generation of ROS and modulation of mitochondrial function.

Marine cyanobacteria are responsible for 25% of gl obal oceanic CO 2 fixation. Many strains dominate regions of the oceans that are characterised by extremely low concentrations of nutrients including trace metals, which are required for photosynthesis (Fe, Mn, Cu) and CO 2 fixation (Zn) amongst other metabolic processes. Indeed, zinc uptake and utilisation in open ocean cyanobacteria is so effective that they do not suffer from zinc limitation even at the lowest possible zinc concentrations [1 , 2]. Genome mining has suggest ed that all cyanobacteria harbour a gene for the zinc uptake regulator Zur [3]. However, since it is not straightforward to predict metal specificity from primary sequence, we have studied the putative Zur protein and its regulon sp. WH8102 (SynZur) . A zur knockout mutant strain displays increased zinc uptake at very low [Zn] as well as decreased zinc tolerance at higher [Zn] . SynZur expressed in E. coli was purified with two bound zinc ions, and this metalloform bound as a dimer to specific DNA sequences (Zur boxes) with nanomolar affinity . Dimers were also found in the X- ray crystal structure of Zn 2SynZur, with a well -conserved structural Cys 4 site, and a novel AspCysHis 2 sensory site unique to c yanobacterial Zur proteins. The dimers show a \"closed\" conformation similar to that expected in a complex with DNA. Native ESI -MS and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicate that the removal of Zn2+ from the sensory site leads to conformational changes, promotes dissociation of the dimers, and abolishes high- affinity DNA binding. In zinc -deficient conditions, this leads to the de -repression of a high- affinity ZnuABC uptake system . A second set of predicted Zur boxes is found upstream of a bacterial metallothionein gene ( bmtA ). Here, Zur binding activates the transcription of bmtA at elevated zinc concentrations. We have expressed and purified this BmtA, and found that it binds Zn2+ with extraordinaril y high affinity. These data taken together suggest a requirement for particularly low free intracellular [Zn2+], but also highlight the benefit of having an intracellular zinc -binding protein: at elevated [Zn], the wild -type was able to acquire much more zinc than the zur KO mutant, without displaying signs of toxicity. This ability is likely to provide an advantage under both high and low external [Zn].

Nitrate accumulation and release of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere due to use of excess fertilizers are examples of two environmental problems, where denitrification plays a central role. Nitrous oxide reductase the last enzyme of this pathway catalyzes the reduction of nitrous oxide at a new tetranuclear copper center (CuZ) the catalytic center overcoming the high activation energy of this reaction. In this center ,each Cu atom is coordinated by two imidazole rings of histidine side -chains, with the exception of Cu IV,with only one histidine . This enzyme has been isolated with \"CuZ\" in two forms CuZ(4Cu1S) and CuZ(4Cu2S), which differ in the Cu I-Cu IVbridging ligand, leading to considerable differences in their spectroscopic and catalytic properties. The copper atoms in CuZ(4Cu1S) can be reduced to the [4Cu1+] oxidation state, and its catalytic properties are compatible with the nitrous oxide reduction rates of whole cells, while in CuZ(4Cu2S) they can only be reduced to the [1Cu2+-3Cu1+] oxidation state, that has a very low turnover number. The catalytic cy cle of this enzyme has been explored and one of the intermediates, CuZ\u00ba, has recently been identified and shown to be in the [1Cu2+-3Cu1+] oxidation state. Contrary to CuZ(4Cu2S), CuZ\u00ba is rapidly reduced intramolecularly by the electron transferring center of the enzyme, CuA, to [4Cu1+] by a physiologically relevant redo The three -dimensional structure of nitrous oxide reductase with \"CuZ\" center as CuZ( x partner. 4Cu1S) or CuZ(4Cu2S) shows that it is a unique functional dimer, with \"CuZ\" center of one sub unit receiving electrons from CuA of the other subunit. The complex nature of this center has posed some questions relative to its assembly, which are only partially answered, as well as which is the active form of \"CuZ\" in vivo . The structural, spectrosco pic and catalytic features of the two forms of \"CuZ\" center will be addressed here. The understanding of its catalytic features and activation is essential to develop strategies to decrease the release of nitrous oxide to the atmosphere and to reduce its concentration in the stratosphere, as well as to serve of inspiration to synthetic inorganic chemists to develop new models of this peculiar and challenging copper sulfide center.

Metalloproteins , which account nearly a quarter to one third of human proteomes, are involved in various biological functions . In particular , metalloproteins play critical roles in metal homeostasis and disease processes. Moreover, they often serve as drug targets especially for metallodrugs.1Despite of numbers of te chniques e.g. ICP -MS, or synchrotron- based techniques that have been employed for identification of metalloproteins,2conventional method, which involved in the protein separation or purification followed by detection of metals, often results in the loss of metal ions that bind to a protein weakly or transiently . We report the design and synthesis of a new family of metal -chelation based fluorescence probes , consisting of a and arylazide .3-6The metal -binding moiety will guide the probe to bind to proteins in live cells, and arylazide serves as an anchor ,upon photoactivation, covalent bonds between the probe and labelled proteins will be formed, enabling downstream protein identification through conventional proteomics .We have developed a series of metal tunable NTA -based fluorescence probes, and identified eukaryotic cells , which provide a basis for further analysis of the biological pathways that these metals participate as well as the mode of action of metallodrugs. Moreover, by conjugation of arsenic binding moiety with a fluorophore and arylazide, an organoarsenic probe was also developed . Using this probe, a number of arsenic -binding proteins have been tracked in both NB4 and HL60 cells. In combination with quantitative proteomics, a new protein target of arsenic trioxide was identified and validated , which extend our knowledge on the mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide. The methodology we developed here combined with other (metallo)proteomics will further advance our understanding on the roles of metals in biology and medicine. Figure 1.

ATP is the universal chemical energy source in cells and is a substrate for a number of pharmaceutically important enzymes. For example, protein kinases convert ATP i nto ADP during the phos phorylation of proteins and represent one of the largest classes of drug targets in the fight against cancer. The creation of synthetic probes that can bind reversibly and selectively to target NPP anions would enable a range of enzymatic processes to be monitored in vitro and in cells , facilitating drug discovery research .1However, existing synthetic probes are limited in biological applications because they cannot discriminate effectively between structurally similar NPP anions. Here we present a new class of luminescent europium(III) complexes (see Figure) ,2capable of binding and discriminating between target NPP anions in aqueous solution. The selective anion binding behaviour ofthese Eu(III) complexes has been exploited for real- time monitoring of a range of enzyme reactions that generate NPP anions, including kinases and glycosyltransferases.3This approach to enzyme monitoring overcomes significant limitations in existing assays, obviating the need for expensive antibodies or equipment, chemically labelled substrates and isolation/purificati on steps. Our label -free method enables rapid and quantitative analysis of enzyme activities and inhibition, offering a potentially powerful tool for high -throughput screening of new inhibitors. We show how p ermutations in the ligand structure can allow cell-penetrating probes to be developed, which localise preferenti ally to the mitochondria ,enabling dynamic changes in ATP levels to be monitored in living cells .4 Financial support by Loughborough University Centre for Imaging Science is gratefully acknowledged.

Herein, we describe the design of a sixteen amino acid peptide which binds a single [4Fe -4S] cluster via four cysteine thiolates in aqueous solution and which possesses all the spectroscopic and electrochemical hallmarks of a natural bacterial ferredoxin [1]. This primitive example of a ferredoxin provides insight into the minimal liganding and non -liganding amino acid requirements for [4Fe -4S] cluster incorporation and stabilization.

We have applied the synchrotron- based methods, X -ray fluorescence (XRF) imaging and X -ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to track the chemistry of selenium species in both cell culture and animal tissues under both normal physiological and disease model settings.[1] This reveals distinct fates for amino acid forms which can be related to their observed biological effect, a reductive metabolism for selenite linked to delayed production of superoxide radical ions and interactions with copper biochemistry, as well as the discovery of a role for selenium in female reproductive function.[2] In several of these cases, the chemistry of selenium in intact tissue samples provides detail about the redox processes that are involved, while in others, redistribution of other heavy elements is informative. We are then able to link these observations to more traditional biochemical data, which provides valuable context. XRF imaging of bovine ovary tissues, showed that selenium was transiently recruited to granulosa cells in ovarian follicles just prior to ovulation, and further biochemical studies, indicated that this was in response to a need for redox stress management. These findings suggest that oocytes in older women are exposed to greater levels of oxidative stress as a result of the aging of ovarian antioxidant defense mechanisms, and that the res ulting oxidative damage to the egg is a cause of fertility issues. Prior theories had assumed that the oocytes themselves were degrading with age. If the hypothesis is true, it provides the opportunity to improve fertility in older women by boosting antiox idant defense in the ovary. Up -to- date results on research pursuing this opportunity will be covered in the presentation.

There is a need to study the in vitro and in vivo properties of europium -based agents in assessing the viability of these molecules to serve as contrast agents. We have studied the physicochemical properties of several europium - containing complexes and performed initial imaging experiments in vivo . The data indicate that divalent europium has similar relaxivity to gadolinium and that divalent europium can be used to image hypoxic regions in vivo . By taking multiple modalities into account, ratiometric pr obes have been studied with the intention of removing the need to know europium concentration in vivo . The results demonstrate that europium -based contrast agents are a promising alternative to gadolinium -based agents for specific purposes such as in the i maging of hypoxic regions of tumors.

The action of hydrogen peroxide on the copper -containing enzymes lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) has been shown to enhance the activity of the enzymes on saccharidic substrates, but also lead to rapid inactivation of the enzyme, presumably thro ugh protein oxidation.

Here , through the use of UV/vis, CD, XAS, EPR, MCD, MS and resonance Raman spectroscopies augmented with DFT calculations, we show that one of the products of protein oxidation in a AA9 LPMO is a long the saccharidic substrates. The formation of the stable Cu(II)- tyrosyl species requires the presence of a water molecule in the axial position of the copper coordination sphere, which then allows the d(x2-y2) SOMO to rotate towa rds the tyrosyl to form a short Cu- (OTyr) bond. The water molecule is only present in substrate -free conditions, meaning that the binding of substrate prevents Cu(II) -tyrosyl formation and thus protein inactivation during coupled catalytic turnover.

Over the last decade, DNA molecules have been widely studied looking for future potential applications at the nanoscale [1]. One of the most popular strategies to achieve such new properties in nucleic acids is the desi gn of metal -based DNA nucleosides . This approach aims to artificially drive metal coordination at our convenience, namely the Watson -Crick face, replacing hydrogen bonding and leading to artificial hybrid metal- ssDNA systems that preserve not only the self-recognition abilities of nucleic acids [5 ,6]but also the natural double helix structure . We demonstrate that metal fragments [M(Cheld)(CH 3CN)] (M = PdII, PtII) can bind to poly(dA) poly(dX) (X = 7 -deazaadenine) oligonucleotides via self -assembly processes leading to the formation of consecutive metal -mediated base pairs [M(Cheld)(adenine)] and [M(Cheld )(7-deaza- adenine)] and therefore giving rise to a novel hybrid metal -DNA systems. The hybrids systems have been widely characterized by different techniques including UV-Vis, CD and NMR spectroscopy , aswell as by mass spectrometry and Ab-initio computational studies. The structure of the individual mononuclear metal - base pairs has also been successfully solved by single crystal X -ray diffraction methods.

Many trace metals are essential micronutrients, but their bioavailable concentrations in the environment and agriculture are vastly different (with natural and anthropogenic causes) i n various habitats, ranging from deficient to toxic levels. Therefore, research has focused on response of photosynthetic model organisms (algae, bacteria and plants) to trace metals and the metalloid arsenic in terms of uptake, transport, sequestration, s peciation, deficiency, toxicity and detoxification. However, numerous studies have used environmentally not relevant extremely high concentrations of the metal(loid)s. In the short summary of research presented here, we analysed environmentally relevant su blethal stress with a combination of different photosynthetic models incl. bacteria Ceratophyllum demersum [4], We used a combination of various biophysical and biochemical methods for measurements in vivo (e.g. photosynthesis biophysics, formation of reactive oxygen species, metal transport), in situ (quantitative (sub)cellular metal(loid) distribution and speciation) as well as on isolated proteins (for identification and characterization of metal binding) and metabolites (metabolomics). These comparisons solved questions about the interdependence of difference mechanisms that diminish the primary productivity of these organisms during sublethal stress by As, Cd, Cu and Cr. Thus, we could show e.g. that metal(loid) concentrations that were previously considered as not toxic actually have a strong impact on photosynthetic cells, with a different sequence of events than observed at the often applied high concentrations. For example, oxidative stress was found to be usually not a primary mechanism of damage, but a consequence of damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. Further, the comparison of the vastly different m odel organisms and metal(loid)s has shown a lot of similarities, but also important differences between specific organisms and metal(loid)s.

The circadian clock is an endogeous time -keeping system that is ubiquitous in animals and plants as well as some bacteria. In mammals, the clock regulates the sleep -wake cycle via two basic helix -loop- helix PER -ARNT -SIM (bHLH -PAS) domain proteins -CLOCK and BMAL1. There is emerging evidence to suggest that heme affects circadian control, through binding of heme to various circadian proteins, but the mechanisms of regulation are largely unknown. In this wor k we examine the interaction of heme with human CLOCK (hCLOCK). We present a crystal structure for the PAS -A domain of hCLOCK, and we examine heme binding to the PAS -A and PAS -B domains. Using UV -visible and EPR spectroscopies, we identify bis -histidine (His/His) heme species in the oxidised (ferric) PAS -A protein, with evidence for flexibility in the heme pocket. By mutagenesis we identify His144 as a ligand to the heme. Using DNA binding assays, we demonstrate that heme disrupts binding of CLOCK to its E-box DNA target .Evidence is presented for a conformationally mobile protein framework, which is linked to changes in heme ligation and which has the capacity to affect binding to the E- box. Within the hCLOCK structural framework, this would provide a me chanism for heme- dependent transcriptional regulation. 226 227 ICBIC-19 ICBIC-19 Invited Lectures Invited Lectures Book of Abstracts Book of AbstractsIL-144 Redox -Regulation and Z inc S ignaling I nvolved in DNA Damage R of Food Chemistry and Toxicology, Institute of Applied Biosciences (IAB), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)), Adenauerring 20a, 76131 Karlsruhe, Germany . 2Department of Food Chemistry and Phytochemistry , Institute of Applied Biosciences (IAB), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)), Adenauerring 20a, 76131 Karlsruhe, Germany . 10, 78464 Konstanz, Germany . Zinc-binding structures are com mon motif sin several transcription factors, DNA repair and tumor suppressor proteins. As one example, poly(ADP -ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP -1) is actively involved in DNA damage signaling, DNA repair and thus maintaining genomic stability. While it is inactive under normal cellular conditions, it gets activated upon the induction of DNA damage; h owever, the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. PARP -1 contains three zinc finger structures involved in DNA strand break recognition, among which the first zinc finger has a remarkably low affinity towards zinc ions [1]. Therefore, we investigated the impact of the cellular zinc status on PARP -1 activity and on genomic stability in HeLa S3 cells. Significant impairment of H 2O2-induced poly(ADP -ribosyl )ation was detected in case of zinc depletion by the zinc chelator TPEN which reduced the total and labile zinc concentrations, despite an increase of DNA strand breaks under these conditions. On the contrary, cellular zinc overload with respect to total as well as labile zinc concentration provoked by incubation with elevated concentrations of ZnCl 2lead to an increased H 2O2-induced poly(ADP -ribosyl)ation. Thus, zinc plays an important role in PARP -1 activation and poly(ADP -ribosyl)ation. Furthermore, we i nvestigated the effect of the cellular zinc status on gene expression profiles via a high- throughput RT -qPCR technique comprising 95 genes related to metal homeostasis and genomic stability. Remarkably, genes coding for metallothioneins responded most sens itively towards a broad range of zinc depletion and zinc overload, regulating zinc homeostasis, thereby preventing other stress responses on conditions of mild zinc depletion or moderate zinc overload. The generation of zinc depletion by higher concentrati ons of TPEN lead to significantly elevated transcript levels of genes coding for DNA repair factors and cell cycle arrest, indicating DNA damage and genomic instability. The impact of zinc overload was less pronounced; here, especially genes related to the oxidative stress response system were up -regulated. Altogether, the results highlight the potential role of zinc signaling for PARP -1 activation and the maintenance of genomic Abhik Ghosh Department of Chemistry, UiT - The Arctic University of Norway, 9037 Troms \u00f8, Norway. abhik.ghosh@uit.no The 5d metallocorroles are a unique class of complexes that incorporate a large 5d transition metal ion within a sterically constrained macrocyclic ligand [1]. Despite the steric mismatch inherent in their structure s, many 5d metallocorroles are chemically and photochemically rugged. Many also exhibit near - IR phosphorescence, a property that can be exploited for oxygen sensing and photodynamic therapy, as well as technological applications such as dye -sensitized solar cells [2]. This talk will present the latest advances in this area, including syntheses of new macrocyclic ligands (such as azulicorrole [3], depicted below) and complexes and their applications in photomedicine, particularly photodynamic therapy.

For first row essential divalent metal ions the binding -order is the Irving -Williams series. This creates a challenge because, of course, some metalloenzymes require the weaker binding metals while other metalloenzymes require the tight binding metals. The challenge can be overcome provided cells maintain the weaker binding metals at greater availabilities than the tighter binding metals: But it has been difficult to define and then measur e the availabilities of metals inside cells. Intracellular metal availabilities have recently been determined by measuring the metal sensitivities of a complete set of DNA -binding metal -sensors (1 -3). The resulting values for a range of essential metals define the intracellular free energies for metalation. The technical approaches are described in a poster by Andrew Foster. Crucially, intracellular metal availabilities are confirmed to be maintained as the inverse of the Irving -Williams series. These value s provide a thermodynamic framework within which it is possible to understand correct protein metalation, exemplified here by a cobalt chelatase for vitamin B 12biosynthesis.

The catalytic efficiency and high selectivities achieved by natural metalloenzymes are a source of inspiration for the design of novel bio inspired catalysts. A powerful approach for creating artificial metalloenzymes involves incorporating a synthetic transition metal catalysts into a protein. We have developed a new concept for the design of artificial metalloenzymes that involves creation of a novel active site at the dimer interface of the transcription factor LmrR (Lactococcal multidrug resistance Regulator).[1]LmrR was selected as the protein scaffold because it contains an unusual large hydrophobic pocket on the dimer interface. Here, two novel classes of LmrR -based artificial metalloenzymes will be presented, involving either supramolecular anchoring of the met al complex[2,3]or biosynthetic incorporation of an unnatural metal binding amino acid using expanded genetic code methodology.[4]These artificial metalloenzymes have been applied successfully in catalytic asymmetric C -C bond forming and hydration reactions. Here we will discuss our recent in the evolution and in vivo application of these artificial metalloenzymes. Structure of an LmrR based artificial metalloenzyme References [1]Roelfes, G. Acc. Chem.

Metal -mediated base pairing between either natural or artificial nucleobases has in many cases been shown to greatly increase the hybridization affinity of oligonucleotides [1 -5]. To harness this stabilization for biological applications, we have explored the possibility of replacing one of the coordinative bonds of the metal -mediated base p air with a covalent C -Mbond [6- 11]. The resulting organometallic nucleobases have the benefit of resisting dissociation even under highly metal -deficient conditions, such as those of the intracellular medium. Among transition metal ions amenable to metal -mediated base pairing, HgIIis attractive because it can readily add to C -H bonds of electron -rich aromatic rings. In the case of cytosine and uracil, addition takes place at the C5 position, resulting in Janus nucleobases with a hydrogen- bonding and a HgIIcoordination \"face\". With phenol, both of the ortho carbon atoms can mercurated, resulting in a nucleobase with two identical HgIIcoordination \"faces\". Consistent with previously reported results on HgII-mediated base pairing [12 -], the HgIIcenters favour coordination thymine -N3 and guanine -N1, with concomitant deprotonation of the nitrogen donor. A good correlation was observed between stabilities of the individual HgII-mediated base pairs (determined by NMR) and thermal stabilities of the r espective modified oligonucleotide duplexes (determined by UV melting experiments). In the presence of thiols, HgII-mediated base pairing was abolished and the 5 -mercuricytosine and 5 -mercuriuracil residues underwent canonical hydrogen -bonded base pairing instead. In contrast to the monomercurated cytosine and uracil bases, dimercurated phenol can form dinuclear HgII-mediated base triples. The potential of this novel binding mode was demonstrated in a model homothymine homoadenine*homothymine triplex incorporating the 2,6 -dimercuriphenol residue in the of the homoadenine strand. Both Hoogsteen and Watson -Crick melting temperatures were increased by more than 10 \u00b0C relative to an otherwise identical triplex having the 2,6- dimercuriphenol residue replaced by an adenine residue.

In the past decades ,investigations on the mechanism of hypoglycemic action of vanadium have revealed key targets [1] including: (i) the heat shock protein family such as Hsp60, grp75, grp78 and Hsc70 etc., with which the interactions involves regulation of PPAR -AMPK signaling, unfolded protein responses, mitochondrial function and Cyclin D signaling; (ii) Protein ph osphatases, with which the interactions regulates the activity of a variety of protein kinases. However, the great challenge is how to achieve highly specific inhibition of certain kind of phosphatases, such as PTP1B for insulin enhancement. Besides the an ti-diabetic effects, t he molecular interaction of vanadium with the targets and subsequent intracellular signal transduction would indicate a variety of new biological/ pharmacological activiti es of vanadium compounds such as 's disease (AD) ,anti-neural cancer ( neuroblastoma ), anti - autism and anti -aging. Therefore, discovery and development of novel vanadium -based medicine would again be an exciting and promising research field. Recent ly, we demonstrated [2] that anti- diabetic vanadyl complexe scould improve the viability of mouse primary cortex neurons ;in the APP/PS1 transgenic AD model mice, vanadium treatment could well preserve the cognitive function and attenuated neuron loss withou taffecting brain A plaques or the distribution . The molecular mechanism involve (i) improving glucose and energy metabolism via activation of the PPAR -AMPK signal transduction and (ii) potential to develop disease -modifying therapeutic agent for future treatment of AD.

Zinc has long been known to play crucial biological roles, including functioning as a co -factor for enzymes and for structural proteins, and more recently, as a signal to modulate specific cellular pathways. One key biological response for which zinc plays an important role is in the regulation of inflammation via the NF -kappa B pathway .There aremultiple zinc co -factored and putative zinc co -factored proteins in the NF -kappa B pathway; how ever, the molecular level details of how zinc modulates this pathway, which proteins within the pathway are bona fide zinc co -factored proteins, and whether zinc plays a signaling role are not well established. We are combining biochemical, cellular, and proteomics approaches to understand how zinc moduleates the NF -kappa B pathway and how exogenous molecules ( i.e.toxic metal ions, beneficial metal ions and signaling molecules) target this pathway. Our work has focused on the protein tristetraprolin (TTP) , an RNA binding zinc finger protein that is regulated by NF -kappa B and which serves as a biomarker of inflammation. Studies aimed at understanding how Zn(II), Pb(II), Au(I) and H 2S modulate TTP activity in vitro and in cells will be presented, along with preliminary proteomics data. These studies are providing insight into the role sof native and xenobiotic metal ions as well as signaling molecules in inflammation ,and have the potential to lead to novel anti -inflammatory strategies.

The central resource is the MetalPDB database of metal sites in biological macromolecules (http://metalweb.cerm.unifi.it/) [1]. In the latest update of MetalPDB, we specifically addressed the identification of potential MFSs in 3D structures lacking the metal cofactor. In addition, updated statistical analyses on the database contents are available on the web site. We are currently introducing f unctional annotation sfor all sites, based on manual curation via a dedicated, password -protected annotator interface. To better exploit the contents of MetalPDB, the MetalS2 [2] and MetalS3 [3 ] servers allow users to compare pairs of metal sites and to search for structurall ysimilar metal- binding sites within the database, respectively. We will show how these tools have beenapplied to the computational characterization of the human iron -proteome [4]. Finally, we will present a newly developed on -line resource, entitled hMeP rot (for human metalloproteome). hMeProt is a database of all human metalloproteins, predicted or experimentally validated, that aggregates information from multiple sources ranging from tissue expression and subcellular localization to functional features such as involvement in disease. The main usage scenarios of hMeProt will be discussed. References [1]V. Putignano, A. Rosato, L. 1231.

F\u00edsicoQu\u00edmica, Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad de Granada, Spain. The concept of manipulating the self -organizing properties of DNA to create nanowires, and ultimately nano circuits , can be exploited using a new way to precisely control the stoichiometry and the position of the metal ions; the us e of DNA molecules containing so -called metal- mediated base pairs [1] . Following this strategy continuous 1D linear chains of AgI ions can be generated inside DNA duplex [2] , thus demonstrating that new metallo -DNA nanowires could be rationally prepared . However, the conducting properties of these systems remains unclear. The reduction of the AgI inside the duplex could considerably improve the conductivity of these system s, but this process should not modify the native Ag - DNA structure in order to support the formation of metallic silver wires. In an effort to explore new reduction methodologies that could be applied for Ag -DNA systems based on silve r-mediated base pairs , we have synthesized and characterized a helical compound containing stacked silver -mediated cytosine 4 (mC = N1 -methylcytosine) , that contain uninterrupted polymeric AgI chains that run through the center of the helixes, comparable to related silver -DNA structures [2b]. The exposure of nanostructures of [Ag(mC) 2]BF 4 to cold hydrogen plasma stimulates the reduction of the prearranged AgI polymeric chains to metallic silver along the material . This solvent -free reduction strategy lead to compound [AgI(mC) 2]X@Ag0 that contains uniformly well - distributed silver metallic nanostructures that are responsible for the new conducting and photoluminescence properties of the material [3]. This methodology could be employed for the generation of multifunctional silver -DNA related materials with tailored properties.

Although these antidotes are efficacious ,their donwsides prevent their use for emergency treatment of cyanide poisoning [2]. Since cyanide is an e ndogenous molecule [3], a physiological mechanism to transform cyanide into non- toxic thiocyanate involves the rhodanase enzyme [4]. Molybdenum sulfur salts are capable of converting cyanide to thiocyanate [5]. Selected compounds were evaluated f or cytotoxicity in three different cancer cell lines [6 ]. The compounds proved to have low cytotoxicity compared to cisplatin and even less so for alkali salts compared to tetraalkylammonium salts.

Warmia and Mazury, Oczapowskiego 4, 10 -719 Olsztyn,Poland Zinc hook domain is the central fragment of Rad50 protein present in every cell containing genomic DNA. Rad50, a sacomponent of conserved MR(N /X) complex, plays central role in double -strand DNA break repair, maintenance of telo mere integrity, meiosis and recombination [1].Suggested key function of Rad50 is to bind DNA ends and place them in close proximity to facilitate downstream repair and signalling procedures .This role can be performed by means of an appropriate structure; a globular domain whose ha lves are divided by long (500 \u00c5 ), anti -parallel, superhelical fragment at centre of which resides unique -type structure, i.e. the zinc hook. Hook domain contains the intermolecular binding site for Zn(II) ion: (C)CXXC (adjacent Cys residue is distinctive for eukaryotes) , responsible for the dimerizati on of the entire MR(N) complex [2].Although highly conserved within and alongside zinc binding site ,minor alterations in Rad50's amino acid sequence is responsible for different affin ity towards Zn(II) as well as different dimer assemblies of Rad50 representatives throughout organisms from different domains of life .By using various physicochemical techniques, i.e. UV -Vis, homo -and hetero - FRET detection, spectropolarimetry, potentiome try, ITC ,NMR and X -raywe were able to thoroughly investigate the rela tionship between Zn(II) affinity, zinc -coupled folding and overall structure of Rad50 dimers. Affinity to wards Zn(II) ions varies for different orthologs of Rad50 protein, which seems to be correlated with Zn(II) availability in cell - P. furiosus - logKML2= 21, prokaryotes (logKML2~ 20), eukaryotes ( H. sapiens with log KML2~ 19 .8 and S. cerevisiae with log KML2 ~ 19)[3,4]. Moreover, zinc hook domains from different organisms consist of dimers with different compositions and arrangements, which may be related to the mechanism of DNA damage response [4]. This systematic overview illustrates how evolution shaped Rad50 protein in terms of its fold and Zn(II) binding proper ties to fit its function inside diverse cellular conditions.

Goodwin Avenue, Urbana, IL 61801 USA . Since the pioneering work by Groves in the 1970s, the mechanisms of aliphatic carbon oxidation by the cytochrome P450s is envisioned to proceed via the generation of a high valent heme -oxo \"Compound I\" state generated bond cleavage of the iron -hydroperoxo intermediate. Suggestions of other \"active oxygen\" reactive states, such as the precursor iron -peroxoanion and the hydroperoxo itself have been proposed, particularly for reactions other than ali phatic hydroxylation. We have examined the carbon -carbon bond scission involved in the generation of androgens by human P450 CYP17A1. We discovered that this reaction is characterized by an inverse solvent isotope effect that is explained by nucleophili c attack of the heme- peroxo anion on the 20 -carbonyl of 17- OH pregnenolone and 17- OH progesterone. With Professors Kincaid and Mak (Marquette) we confirm this reactivity by low temperature trapping of a six membered and characterization by reso calculations by Olsen and co -workers show this intermediate to be the favorable transition state in this C -C lyase reaction and note that hydrogen abstraction from an aliphatic alcohol, an alternate proposal, is not possible. We have analyzed the complete kinetic description of the P450 reaction cycle to establish the inverse solvent isotope effect as an easily measured marker for non - canonical P450 reaction che mistry using the peroxoanion.

Nucleic acids can interact with silver ions but also bind silver after partial reduction and formation of few-atom clusters of Ag/Ag+ [1]. Such Ag -nanoclusters can display very interesting optical properties such as luminescence in the visible and near -infrared regions [2]. These DNA- stabilized silver nanoclusters (DNA -AgNCs) are applied in a range of nanoscientific applications including in the efficient detection of proteins and nucleic acids [3]. However, the diverse optical properties of DNA- AgNCs, their mechanism o f formation and aspects of their composition remain unexplored, making the intelligent design of nanocluster probes challenging. Here we present a synthetic procedure for obtaining high ly emissive DNA -AgNCs based on a probe design with a C -loop structure in a hairpin with duplex base - pairing, which has been applied in microRNA detection [4]. Purification through size -exclusion chromatography allowed the isolation of the emitting species on a preparatory scale. Through a combination of gel electrophoresis, ICP -MS, and small -angle X -ray scattering (SAXS) in conjunction with the systematic study of various DNA sequences, the low -resolution structure and mechanism of the formation of AgNCs with a C -loop hairpin DNA sequence was investigated. It is proposed that the DNA - AgNCs self -assemble via a head -to-head binding of two DNA hairpins, bridged by the silver nanocluster, resulting in the modelling of a dimeric structure, harbouring an Ag 12 cluster.

Despite significant progress and the continuous discovery of ever more ef ficient cancer therapies, chemo resistance has remained a formidable challenge in the treatment of cancer. Besides toxicity and adverse side -effects, inherent and acquired resistance towards platinum -drugs are the major limitations of the leading anticancer drug cisplatin. A common strategy to reduce the risk of cancer cells developing resistance is the application of combination therapy, i.e. the co -administration of different drugs with distinct targets and independent modes of act ion. Metallodrugs allow the combination of two (or more) anticancer entities, i.e. a bioactive metal and bioactive ligand(s), into a single molecule, thus ensuring the simultaneous delivery and activation at the target site. Octahedral Pt(IV) derivatives o f cisplatin are pro -drugs that release the DNA -targeting Pt(II) species and the axial ligands on intramolecular reduction. Our group is interested in bioactive ligands that target the mitochondria [1]. So -called 'mitocans' (the acronym for mitochondria and cancer) are an emerging class of anticancer agents that attack the energy -producing machinery of the cancer cell [2]. This lecture will present a series of new Pt(IV) complexes based on the cisplatin and oxaliplatin scaffolds and a bioactive ligand that interacts with the translocator protein on the outer mitochondrial membrane. The complexes show micromolar activity against MCF -7breast cancer cells .Detailed mechanistic studies including DNA damage, cell death pathway, effect on the mitochondrial membrane potential and on the mitochondria lmorphology will be discussed. The combination of antimitochondrial ligands with metal ions other than Pt will also be briefly described. References [1]D. Montagner, B. Fresch, K.

Increasing bacterial and fungal drug resistance makes novel, effective antimicrobial treatments actively sought. Because of the general lack of resistance towards AMPs, they are being relied on as a novel class of therapeutics aimed to conquer drug -resistant bacteria and fungi [1]. Biologically indispensable metal io nshave a dual effect on the activity of antimicrobial peptides: (i) AMPs bind them, so that microbes cannot get enough metals essential for their life and virulence (withdrawal of metal ions, nutritional immunity) or (ii) AMPs need the given metal ion as a booster of their antimicrobial activity (metal ions affect the AMP charge and/or structure) [2]. The presence of Zn(II) and Cu(II) significantly enhance sthe antimicrobial activity of c alcitermin, an antimicrobial peptide from the fluid of the human airways (a C-terminal cleavage fragment of calgranulin C), SAAPs - anionic peptides from sheep and clavanins - His-rich, cat ionic peptides from tunicates. MIC breakpoints of several of these complexes are much lower than the ones for commonly used antibiotics and antifungal agents. We discuss the details of the coordination mode, structure and stability of the studied complexes, in order to understand the relationship between their bioinorganic chemistry and mode of action.

The challenge of biochemically such as Cu(I), Ag(I) and Zn(II) in proteins can be tackled by techniques such as extended x -ray absorption (EXAFS) and fluorescence spectroscopy. Here I will be describing my laboratory's success in extending these techniq ues to monitor metalloprotein metal transfer in real time via native tryptophan stopped flow fluorescence as well as rapid freeze quench EXAFS. I have also been able to use both techniques complementarily in order to obtain both structural and kinetic data on important and challenging silent metal efflux and transfer proteins. As a professor at a primarily undergraduate institution in the U.S., my lab's work is best when combined with collaboration, so in this unique talk I will be discussing three collabor ative projects1,2and the progress we have been able to make by combining our individual labs' skills to ward answering abiding metallobiochemical questions . In particular, I will discuss our work to determine the mode of Cu(I)/Ag(I) efflux in the Cus C(F)B A pump in E. coli, and Zn(II) metallotransfer in the Azt Zn chaperone pathway in P. denitrificans . I will also discuss our recent spectroscopic work to identify and understand Fe -S clusters in interesting and pathogenically relevant iron uptake systems. References [1]K.N. Chac\u00f3n, Z.S.

Cells labeled with paramagnetic metal complexes produce a MRI signature that facilitates cell tracking in vivo .1While mammalian stem cells have been the focus of MRI cell tracking studies to date,2 it is also of interes t to image fungi by using MRI. Fungal infections have gained attention due to the ubiquitous presence of yeast in the human body and the increasing number of immunocompromised patients that develop infections. Our laboratory is involved in the deve lopment of transition metal contrast agents3-5based on Co(II), Fe(II) and Fe(III) for cell tracking studies. Complexes of Co(II) and Fe(II) produce highly shifted ligand and water proton resonances, producing asymmetric z -spectra when loaded into cells or into liposomes as shown by NMR and MRI studies. F e(III) complexes enhance T 1or T2relaxation effects in cells . In efforts described here, bimodal imaging agents of Co(I I) or Fe(III) that contain a paramagnetic center and a fluorophore will be presented. The fluorescent tag enables identification of the cellular compartmentalization of the probe by using fluorescence microscopy. Studies on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the will be prese nted. P inocytosis, electroporation and heat shock uptake have been studied, resulting in different cellular compartmentalization of the probe.

Initially identified for its ability to inhibit the growth of neurons, it remains uncertain whether MT3 plays a role in the cellular biology of metals in the brain. We have measured binding constants for MT3 and several metal ions and showed that it binds lead more tightly than it binds zinc. We have also shown that MT3 mRNA levels are not elevated by exposure to metal ions in mammalian neuronal cell cultures, despite the presence of several metal response elements in the mt3 promoter region. In this work, we will discuss results from experiments designed to elucidate the functionality of the mt3 metal response elements as well as experiments that probe the response of M T3 mRNA levels to hypoxia, another cellular stressor associated with MT3 activity. We also present results from experiments that examine MT3 -actin interactions as a function of MT3 metallation status in an effort to explore cellular processes that can expl ain the mechanism by which MT3 inhibits the growth of neurons. We will also present results from ITC studies of the thermodynamic of copper binding to MT3.Oral Presentations246 247 ICBIC-19 ICBIC-19 Oral Presentations Oral Presentations Book of Abstracts Book of AbstractsOP-01 A Spectroscopy -Based A pproach to Understand R esistance of M.

Winnipeg, Canada. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) re- emerges as a major Public Health risk due to appearance of multidrug -resistant strains. The first -line antituberculosis treatment is based on isoniazid (INH), a prodrug that is activated by the pathogenic bacteria itself and via a heme- containing enzyme ( M. tuberculosis catalase- peroxidase, of the INH -NADH adduct. However, the descriptio n of the molecular mechanism for the enzyme -catalyzed activation of INH by MtKatG is yet under debate (1). The oxidation of INH at the heme site and using the conventional peroxidase- like mechanism fails to explain the role of the frequently found mutation s in KatG isolated from INH resistant patients, called missense -type, and which are far from the heme site (2). Clearly such mutations are uncorrelated to the heme -edge oxidation of INH as substrate , and involving the [Fe(IV)=O Por+] catalytic intermediate. Based on our previous findings on KatG catalytic intermediates ( 3,4), the INH binding site being far from the KatG heme site (5 ), and the INH oxidation occurring via a [Fe(IV)=O Trp] species formed subsequently to the [Fe(IV)=O Por+] intermediate and involving catalytically- relevant lon g-range electron transfers (6 ), we have further identified an allosteric effect of the various mutations allowing to rationalize, for the first time, the induced inactivation effect of the mutations on the capability of MtKatG to oxidize INH. Specifically, our detailed EPR spectroscopy characterization of the various mutants well - agree with perturbations (long -range allosteric effects) on the extended H -bonding network (see Figure) , that we have previously shown to be crucial for the formation of the Trp -based intermediates in KatGs (7). Our unprecedented rationalization of the TB resistance provides a new tool to design INH analogs t o overcome the resistance induced by the various mutations uncorrelated to the heme site .

All p yranop terin containing Mo enzymes require a unique and prope rly synthesized molybdenum cofactor (Moco) [2]for function.

In our opinion, it has been of great interest to investigate whether tantalum complexes could be a challenge for bioinorganic chemistry ,following the similar story as other transition metals, such as platinu m, ruthenium osmium or iridium. Since the tantalum coordination chemistry is quite rich , we had to choose carefully the structural type to be studied. We chose, as an analogue of many highly cytotoxic Ru, Rh, Os and Ir agents, the half - sandwich structural type and we prepared a series of the [Ta(5-Cp*)Cl 2(nL)] complexes ; Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ,nH2L=2-{(E)-[(2-hydroxyphenyl)imino]methyl}phenol (H2L)or its .The first representative of this series, [Ta(5-Cp*)Cl 2(L)] (1; see figure below) , was markedly more active in vitro ( p<0.005) at various human cancer cell lines with different sensitivity towards cisplatin , implying its ability to kill cancer cells with both the intrinsic and acquired resistance towards the therapeutic effect of the conventional cisplatin [2].In contrast to the cancer cells, the biological effect of 1at the used non -cancerous cells ( e.g. primary culture of hepatocytes) was negligible. The cell death is induced via apoptosis, most likely through the mitochondrial pathway, as suggested by the results of various flow cytometry experiments ( e.g., induction of apoptosis or a release of the pro -apoptotic protein cytochrome c into the cytosol) performed on the treated cancer cells .Within the contribution, an attention will be paid to the effect of the H 2L ligand substitution on the biological activity of the [Ta(5- 2(nL)] complexes, and to details of solution behaviour in various water -containing media as well as the results of the interaction studies with various relevant biomolecules will be also discussed.

Four heme peroxidase superfamilies independently in the pero xidase - cyclooxygenase superfamily the prosthetic group is p osttranslationally modified (PTM). As a consequence these peroxidases can form one, two or three covalent bonds between heme substituents and the protein. This include ester bonds between heme 1 -and 5 -methyl groups and glutamate and aspartate residues as well as a sulfonium ion link between the heme 2 -vinyl substituent and a methionine. Here the phylogeny and physiological of representatives of chordata peroxidases (family 1) [2], peroxidasins (family 2) [3,4], and (family 6) [5,6]of this superfamily, their occurrence in allkingdoms of life, the relevant sequence motifs for definite identification and the a vailable crystal structures are presented.

In particular, methylation /demethylation of cytosine (C) in DNA is an important epigenetic m odification of the genome, and this process plays a crucial role in the regulation o f developmental gene expression .The mechanism of DNA methylation, i.e., formation of 5 - methylcytosine (5mC) has been studied very well, whereas for DNA demethylation recen t studies revealed that 5 -hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is an important intermediate in the active demethylation process . Much effort has gone into developing a simple reaction that can be used for the detection of 5mC and 5hmC. Although bisulfide methods or immunoprecipitation methods are often used for 5mC analysis, they are not suitable for sequence- specific labeling of 5mC. The ability to distinguish 5mC and 5hmC from C, i.e., to detect the existence of only one methyl group in a long DNA stran d, is still a chemically and biologically challenging subject. We have developed the 5mC -selective osmium complex formation for effective detection of 5mC.[1] We synthesized a bipyridine- attached adenine derivative for sequence- specific osmium complex form ation. Sequence -specific osmium complex formation was achieved by the hybridization of a short DNA molecule containing this functional nucleotide to a target DNA sequence, and resulted in the formation of a crosslinked structure. The interstrand crosslink clearly distinguished 5mC from C, which was applied to quantification of the degree of methylation at a specific cytosine in a whole genome and to visualization of methylation regions in chromosomes. We have also developed adetection method of 5hmC ,which is a newly discovered natural nucleobase that may play an important intermediary role in the active DNA demethylation pathway. [2-4]We found 5hmC from its epigenetic precursors, C and 5mC in DNA. T he dinuclear peroxotungstate was added to a DNA solution in a pH 7 sodium phosphate buffer andthe mixture was incubated at 50 \u00b0 C for 5 h. The reaction proceeded 5hmC - selectively. The mass spectrum of the oxidation product obtained from the 5hmC -containing DNA indicated the formation of trihydroxylated thymine (thT) in DNA. The tungsten oxidation products induced the incorporation of adenine into the complementary site in a primer extension, and made it possible to detect 5hmC in a DNA sequence of interest in a convent ional DNA sequencing analysis.

Dirhodium(II) carboxylates, Rh 2(\u00b5-RCOO) 4, show remarkable antitumor properties. Possible mechanisms of action include inhibition of DNA replication by direct DNA binding, and inhibition of transcription due to re dox reactions with thiol groups on T7- RNA polymerase [1]. Earlier in -vitro showed irreversible inhibition of enzymes containing thiol ( -SH) groups at or near their active site, leading to breakdown of the paddlewheel structure around the Rh(II) -Rh(II) bond and oxidation of the Rh(II) ions. But the cage structure with four bridging carboxylate groups (see the figure below) remained intact in react ions with human serum albumin or methionine, since both the imidazole group of the histidine residue and the thioether of methionine could bind reversibly to itsaxial positions [2]. Recent studies in our group demonstrated that aerobic reactions of Rh 2(CH 3COO) 4with glutathione and L-cysteine led to multi- complexes with two or three thiolate bridges between Rh(III) atoms. We also found that methionine (HMet) at ~40\u00b0 C could Rh2(CH 3COO) 2(S,N,O -Met) 2,where two of acetate groups were replaced by tridentate methionine ligands also occupying the axial sites [3]. S -methylcysteine, however, formed mononuclear Rh(III) species, showing that the ring size of the chelating ligand is important for the stability of the complex [4]. Moreover, X -ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) and cell viability studies showed no toxicity and poor uptake of the Rh 2(CH 4, emphasizing that the antitumor activity depend son availability of the axial positions of these dirhodium(II) compounds [4]. Our results on the reactions of Rh 2(CH 3COO) 4with the above sulfur - containing biomolecules will be presented during this conference.

However, the chemical modification of Cys -93 in Hb weakens the IHP eff ect.[6] In this paper, we present the nwe protein cluster composed of recombinant Hb (Cys -93Ala) variant, rHb(C93A) - HSA 3, and its unique O 2 binding property.[7] First, rHb(C93A) in which Cys -93 is genetically replaced with Ala was expressed using Pichia yeast and purified sequentially using cation -exchange column chromatography and HSAs, - maleimidpropionate (SMP) a crosslinking agent. The O 2 affinity ( P50: O 2 pressure where Hb is half - saturated with O 2) and Hill coefficient ( n) of rHb(C93A) and rHb(C93A) -HSA 3 cluster were determined from their O 2 dissociation curves in PBS solution at 37\u00b0C. As expected, rHb(C93A) -HSA 3 cluster showed almost the same O 2 binding parameters ( P50 = 10 Torr , n = 1.3) as those of naked rHb(C93A) (P 50 = 11 Torr, n = 1.5). Remarkably, the O 2 affinity of rHb(C93A) -HSA 3 cluster decreased ( P50: 1016 Torr) upon addition of IHP. It rather contrasts against the fact that IHP effect was not observed in Hb- HSA 3 cluster. The complexation of IHP induced the moderate reduction of the O 2 affinity in much the same way as native Hb. References [1] F. Meng, T. Kassa, S. Jana, F. Wood, X. Zhang, Y. Jia, F. D'Agnillo, A. I.

A fascinating facet of ribonucleotide reductase's (RNRs) Chemistry has been the identification of a dimangan ese (Mn 2) active site in class Ib RNRs that requires superoxide anion (O 2-), rather than dioxygen (O 2), to access a high -valent Mn 2oxidant via a MnIIMnIII-peroxide intermediate . We have identified two MnII2complexes that, upon exposure to KO 2,yield MnIIMnIII-peroxide adducts, providing into Mn 2RNRs reactivity. The MnIIMnIII-peroxide absorption max~ 450, 600 nm) typical of a Mn and either a 29 -or 22-line typical of absorption electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI- MS) confirmed the elemental composition of the MnIIMnIII-peroxides. Both complexes were unreactiv etowards weak C -H bonds, and were only reactive with ferrocene and weak O -H bonds upon activation with proton donors. In contrast ,one of the complexes was found to be an efficient nucleophilic oxidant. Our find ings provide support for the postulated mechanism of O 2-activation at class Ib Mn 2RNRs and the activation of the MnIIMnIII-peroxide core with electrophiles. References : [1]Adriana M.

Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are a recently discovered class of monocopper enzymes, broadly distributed across the Tree of Life [1]. Recent reports indicate that LPMOs can use H2O2as an oxidant, and, thus, carry out a novel type of peroxygenase reaction involving unprecedented copper chemistry [2]. Here, we present a combined computational and experimental analysis of the H 2O2-mediated reaction mechanism [3].In silico studies, based on a model of the enzyme in complex with a crystalline substrate [4], suggest that a network of hydrogen bonds, involving both the enzyme and the substrate, brings H 2O2 into a strained reactive conformation, and guides a deri ved hydroxyl radical towards formation of a copper -oxyl intermediate. The initial cleavage of H 2O2and subsequent hydrogen atom abstraction from chitin by the copper- oxyl intermediate are the main energy barriers. Stopped- flow fluorimetry experiments demon strated that the priming reduction of LPMO -Cu(II) to LPMO -Cu(I) is a fast process compared to the re- oxidation reactions. Using single turnover conditions, we found that re -oxidation of LPMO -Cu(I) is 2000 -fold faster with H2O2than with O 2, the latter being several orders of magnitude slower than rates reported for other monooxygenases. In accordance with the peroxygenase nature of the LPMO, the presence of substrate accelerated re- oxidation by H 2O2, whereas re- oxidation by O 2became slower. These novel in sights into the peroxygenase nature of LPMOs will aid in the development and application of enzymatic and synthetic copper catalysts and may contribute to a further understanding the roles of LPMOs in Nature, varying from biomass conversion to chitinolytic pathogenesis L ight Guangyu Zhu1,2 1Department of Chemistry, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR ,P.

China. guangzhu@ cityu.edu.hk Despite the broad clinical applications of platinum -based anticancer drugs including cisplatin, their side-effects and resistance issues have encouraged researchers to look for novel metal -based anticancer complexes. Non- traditional platinum compounds especially Pt(IV) complexes have been extensively studied and they hold great promise to be further developed as the next -generation platinum drugs.[1] Selective activation of prodrugs within a tumor is p articularly attractive because of their low damage to normal tissue. In this presentation, I will introduce the design, photoactivation mechanism, and antitumor activity of a visible activation property: it is shown to be inert in the dark but under short- period irradiation with low intensity of visible light, without the need of any external catalyst, the prodrug is rapidly reduced. The prodrug displays superior antitumor act ivity both in vitro and in vivo in human carcinoma models. The controllable activation property and superior antitumor activity of this prodrug may suggest a novel strategy for the design of visible light -activatable platinum prodrugs to reduce the adverse effects and conquer drug resistance of traditional platinum chemotherapy.

Mann1,Yibing Wu1,Nicholas F. Polizzi1,and William F. DeGrado1 1Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, California, USA. Metalloproteins perform chemical transformations with rates and selectivities that have yet to be achieved in synthetic or designed systems. These differences in reactivity are directly linked to the environment produced by the protein matrix that cannot be easily reproduced in synthetic constructs. To test our understanding of how metalloproteins function, we aim to design de novo metalloproteins from scratch. Proteins that bind metalloporphyrins are of particula r interest, as heme proteins are known to perform a variety of reactions. Only recently have we been able to design proteins that bind a cofactor with sub -\u00c5 accuracy.1This opens the door to expand on the utility of natural proteins by incorporating synthe tic inorganic cofactors into proteins that lack pre -evolved function. This research seeks to elucidate the design features necessary to bind M- diphenylporphyrin (M -DPP; M= Fe, Mn) complexes in close proximity to a substrate binding pocket. I have successfu lly designed a four- helix bundle that binds M - DPP complexes with nanomolar affinity and is one of the few de novo cofactor -binding proteins that is well structured. Structural characterization with XRD showed that the structure matches the design with 1 \u00c5RMSD. First-and second -shell interactions will be engineered to control orientation, electronic structure, and reaction pathway of the cofactor and substrate. The selectivity of these metalloenzymes will also be tested and the protein scaffold redesigned to elicit regioselectivity.

The abundance and versatility of iron -sulfur (Fe -S) cluster -bound transcription factors in all forms of life. This vividly contrasts with the scarcity of information on their structural and molecular mechanism , as exemplified by the White B -like ( Wbl) proteins found in the notoriously persistent bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Mtb -4S] cluster-bound monomeric transcription factors , and they play versatile roles in the redox stress response and persistence of the pathogen. Previous studies indicate Mtb Wbl proteins regulate gene expression by interact ing with the sigma -70 primary sigma factor SigA in the RNA polymerase holoenzyme of Mtb . However , the underlying mechanism of action for Wbl proteins remain conjecture due to lack of atomic structural information of how a Wbl protein binds to SigA. T o fill this critical knowledge ga p, we have structurally characterized the interaction between a Wbl protein and region 4 of SigA (Wan, et. al ., unpublished). Our atomic resolution structure revealed unusual characteristics of the interaction between the two proteins. Combining our biochemical and site -directed mutagenesis studies, the results from the structure -function analysis support that the Wbl protein regulates gene expression by a noncanonical mechanism relative to other transcription activators bound to regio n 4 of the primary sigma factor . 262 263 ICBIC-19 ICBIC-19 Oral Presentations Oral Presentations Book of Abstracts Book of AbstractsOP-17 Deciphering M olecular Mechanism of S ilver by A pproaches Enables E nhancing and Sun1 1Department of Chemistry, The University of Ho ng Kong, Hong Kong, P. R. China. Despite the broad -spectrum antimicrobial activities of silver, its internal usage is restricted owing to the toxicity. Strategies to enhance its efficacy are highly desirable but rely heavily on the understanding of its molecular mechanism of action [1]. S ilver has long been deemed to bind thiols in enzymes and thereby inactivates their functions , however, up to now, no direct silver -targeting proteins have been mined at a proteome- wide scale owing to the lack of appropriate techniques, which hinders system ic studies on the biological pathways interrupted by silver [2]. Herein, we build up a unique system, namely LC-GE-ICP-MS, and mapped out Ag+-binding proteins (Ag+-proteome) in E. coli for the first time. By using integrated omic approaches including metal loproteomics, metabolomics, bioinformatics and systemic biology, we delineated the first dynamic antimicrobial actions of Ag+, i.e., it primarily damages multiple enzymes in glycolysis and TCA cycle, leading to the stalling of the oxidative branch of the T CA cycle and an adaptive metabolic divergence to the reductive glyoxylate pathway. It then further damages the adaptive glyoxylate pathway and suppresses the cellular oxidative stress responses, causing systemic damages and death of the bacterium [3]. The silver -targeting residues in the identified proteins were further illustrated by crystal structures of silver -bound GAPDH and MDH at the atomic level [4]. Based on the molecular mechanism derived from our investigation, the therapeutic effect of Ag+ could be enhanced by supplementation of metabolites from TCA cycle and glycolysis , thereby reducing its dosage. Our mouse model of E. coli infection successfully demonstrates a proof -of-principle that fundamental knowledge and molecular understanding of silver s tress can be translated into new anti- bacterial approaches in clinic. Our study resolves long -standing questions on how Ag+ exerts its antimicrobial activity at the molecular level and may also open up new horizons for in -depth exploration of silver (and nanosilver) toxicology in other bacteria. The integrated omic approaches approach we describe here can be widely applied to explore the molecular targets and mechanisms of action of other metal -based antimicrobial and anticancer drugs, and thereby facilitat ing the development of new therapeutics [5].

Adetailed mechanistic picture is obtained by combining electrochemistry, spectroscopy, and photocatalysis for electron transfer, assigned to formation of CoIII-H, is found upon reduction of CoII, in line with a p Ka(CoIII-H) of approximately 7.25. Subsequent reduction ( -0.94 V vs. NHE) and protonation close the catalytic cycle. An upper limit for the second relevant protonation, eg the p Kaof CoII-H, is found at a pH of 3. Methoxy substitution on the bipyridyl scaffold results in the expected cathodic shift of the reduction, but fails to change the p Ka(CoIII-H). A mechanistic proposal is formulated based on the Pourbaix diagram along with an outlook for design criteria for new generations of catalysts. Refe rences [1]S. Schnidrig, K. K. Baldridge, P.

In hypertensive crises, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), Na 2[Fe(CN) 5NO], is frequently used, which causes undesirable side effects . One of them is the release of cyanide in the body ,and also a strong hypotension caused by fastvasodilation kinetics due to NO release. T herefore, ruthenium compoun ds containing a nitrosyl group and 1)(L (bpy) or phenanthrolin e (phen), were synthesized as an alternative to SNP . In order to compare the kinetic effect of vasodilatation of ruthenium and nitroprusside complexes, vasodilation tests were performed using aortic rings of wistar rats. Nitroprusside showed extremely rapi d ( 198s), while the bipyridine ruthenium complexes containing L = 5 -aza, Tu and SO 32-ligands have a time of 450 s; 670s and 1535 s, respectively. For the phenanthroline ruthenium containin gL = 5 -aza, Tu and SO 32-ligands the average time to reach the maximum relaxation effect was 665s; 451s and 1213 s, respectively. The ruthenium complexes with sulphite showed a kinetic of vasodilatation approximately 10 -fold slower than sodium nitropru sside, while th e other complexes were 3 -to 5- fold slower as well .These results support ruthenium nitrosyl complexes promising dynamics for promoting more controlled vasodilation, while not having any issue on releasing cyanide.

The infections caused by P. aeruginosa are usually resistant to treatment of multiple antibiotics due to the bacterial intrinsic drug resistance and formation of biofilm [2]. Recent studies demonstrated that Ga(NO 3)3exhibited excellent bactericidal activity against P. aeruginosa by interfering bacterial iron metabolism [3]. Although it is indicated that P. aeruginosa utilized the same transport pathway to uptake iron a nd gallium, the exact mechanism of gallium uptake remains unknown. Herein, we utilized CRISPR - Cas9 to inactivate 5 identified iron uptake pathways in P. aeruginosa individually. And we demonstrate that a ferric transporter (HitABC) is the major pathway for gallium uptake in P. aeruginosa. In contrast, the two siderophore -mediated (pyochelin and pyoverdine) iron uptake pathways are not involved in gallium uptake. In vitro biochemical data confirmed that the periplasmic iron binding protein, HitA could bind gallium tightly. The structure of metal -bound HitA further revealed that gallium and ferric ion shared the same metal -binding site of HitA.

Complex inorganic active sites perform challenging catalytic transformations in biological systems, such as water oxidation by Photosystem II and nitrogen reduction in Nitrogenase. The effect of cluster structure on the physical and chemical properties of these active sites is not well understood. We have developed methodologies for the rational synthesis of tetra -and pentanuclear homo -and hetero -metallic cluster models of the Oxygen Evolving Complex in Photosystem II, which allow for systematic structure - property studies. Clusters displaying the cubane motif found in the OEC have been prepared, and the redox inactive metal was found to impact redox chemistry. Tetranuclear clusters that structurally model the dangler motif have also been synthesized, with open coordination sites for water coordination. Distal redox changes have been demonstrated to have a substantial effect on the reactivity of aquo, hydroxide, and oxo ligands relevant to water oxidation. Upon incorporation of second coordination sphere hy drogen bonding interactions, water oxidation catalysis was observed. Spectroscopic studies of models with structures or redox states relevant to the OEC provide benchmarking for the biological system. Implications for the function and spectroscopy of the OEC will be discussed.

Copper is a versatile catalyst for oxygen -dependent reactions. Combined with appropriate ligands, copper can cycle between the oxidation states I, II and III to act ivate molecular oxygen (O 2) and to form reactive oxygen species that can initiate very difficult reactions.[1]Mononuclear copper enzymes usually bind copper in histidine -dominated tetrahedral or square planar coord ination spheres. T he formylglycine generating enzyme (FGE) is unique in this regard, because it binds a single Cu (I) by linear bis -cysteine coordination.[2]FGE catalyzes the oxidative conversion of specific peptidyl -cysteines to formylglycine via abstraction of the pro -(R)--hydrogen atom. The crystal structure of FGE from Thermomonospora curvata in complex with Ag (I) (tc FGE_Ag, PDB: 5NXL), and most recently, the crystal structure of FGE from Streptomyces coelicolor in complex PDB: 6MUJ), combined with biochemical characterization showed that two active site cysteines are the only metal ligands and that the Cu (I) bound state is the catalytic resting state.[3]In this presentation we describe the crystal structure of tc FGE in complex with Cu (I) and a 17- residue substrate analog. Based on this structure with atomic resolution (1.04 \u00c5) together with NMR spectroscopy and kinetic characterization, we identify an acidic O 2-binding pocked juxtaposed to the copper center as key determinant for efficient O2-activation.

The acquisition of the first -row transition metal ions (for example, iron, zinc, and manganese) from the host is crucial for the survival and propagation of pathogenic bacteria. The primary transporters used by bacteria to scavenge these essential trace metals are the ATP -binding cassette (ABC) permeases. Accordingly, any loss or disruption to the function of these transporters severely impairs bacterial virulence. Despite this, how ABC permeases recognise and acquire their cognate metal ion cargo remains poorly understood. Given the essential role of ABC permeases in bacterial virulence and their absence from eukaryotic genomes, knowledge of the molecular details of these transporters will provide novel opportunities for antimicrobial exploitation. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a Gram -positive human bacterial pathogen that is responsible for more than 1 million deaths every year. The S. pneumoniae ABC permease, PsaBCA, is a manganese -specific uptake transporter that is essential for growth and in vivo virulence. This presentation will describe our work in understanding how transition metals are bound by the metal -recruiting protein PsaA and deliver ed to the PsaBC transporter, in addition to our recent determination of the high resolution crystal structure o f the entire PsaBC transporter. 270 271 ICBIC-19 ICBIC-19 Oral Presentations Oral Presentations Book of Abstracts Book of AbstractsOP-25 Photoinduced E lectron Transfer in Sweden Photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) has been observed in lanthanide complexes upon excitation o f the light-harvesting antenna of the ligand [1-3]. This process is dependent on the reductive power of the antenna in its excited state, and on the reduction potential of the lanthanide (III) ion. PeT leads temporarily to the formation of Ant+-Ln(II) species. For most lanthanide complexes PeT results in the quenching of luminescence . However, f or Yb -complexes photo- induced electron transfer , followed by a back electron transfer can yield an excited state Yb(III) species, and thus sensitize luminescence emission [4]. In this work, a serie s of Yb (III)-complexes based on a cyclen scaffold were designed and synthesized . The pendant arms were substituted with either carboxylate or amide groups in order to modulate the reduction potential of the metal centre . The redox properties of the complexes, as well as their luminescent properties were investigated . Changes of the ligand -based and metal -based emissions were observed , that correlate d with the tuned reduction potential of Yb (II)/Yb (III). Control of the reduction potential of the metal centre could thus modulate Yb emission. This strategy represents an alternative to altering the light -harvesting antenna.

R. China. chenyu63@mail.sysu.edu.cn; ceschh@mail.sysu.edu.cn As the crucial nuclear enzymes that control the topological state of DNA, topoisomerase I(Topo I ) and topoisomerase (Topo II )are the promising drug target in oncology.[1]However, several negative consequences were observed when using single inhibitor or even simultaneous treatment.[2]Therefore, Topo I/II dual inhibitors have attracted increasing interest. On the other hand, p oison and catalytic inhibitor are two type of topoisomerase inhibitor. Poison refers to inhibitors that selectively affect the re - ligation of DNA and form stable enzyme -DNA- inhibitor ternary complexes. In contrast, catalytic inhibitor is the term used for those agents that prevent the binding of topo enzymes and DNA, which is resulted from inhibitor -DNA interaction and/or inhibitor -enzyme interaction. In should be noticed that, the majority of topo inhibitors, including clinical used drugs camptothecin and etoposide, are designated topo poisons. Reports on topo I and topo II dual catalysis inhibitors a re rare. This may be due to the structural differences between the two enzymes, resulting in design difficulties. To the best of our knowledge, none of catalyt ic inhibitor have been proved for clinical treatment. Our p revious reports indicated that some Ru(II) complexes, such as [Ru(bpy) 2(pscl)]2+and [Ru(bpy) 2(psbr)]2+, could efficiently inhibit both of T Iand Topo II.[3-4]However, they are all design ated topo poisons and their nuclear accumulation remains to be confirmed . Herein, Ru(II) complexes ( 1-7) were developed. In vitro study indicated that 1 -7are efficient Topo I/II dual inhibitors with similar activity (IC 50< 1 M), which is resulted from DNA- intercalating and Topo I/II protein binding. However, their cytotoxicity is inconsistent with the inhibit activity. Due to their poor membrane penetration, the IC 50value of complex 1 -5for cisplatin resistance cancer cell A549/DDP are more than 150M. The introduction of auxiliary ligand dip can improve cellular uptake and cytotoxicity (IC50 80 M) but fail to localize nuclear. The nuclear targeting was successfully achieved by cyclometallation. The IC50value for cyclometalated complex 7 is about 2 M and its ability as anticancer agent is further confirmed by in vivo experiment.

OP-28 Impact of Cu(I) on Structural Metal -Binding Sites in Zinc Metalloproteins and Peptides Kathryn Spla n, Isaiah Eckhart -Frank, Hoang Anh Phan Department of Chemistry, Macalester Grand Avenue , St. Paul, MN 55105. Proper metalloprotein structure is maintained, in part, by the coordination geometry of the endogenous metal, and substitution of the native metal with one that displays different coordination preferences is likely to alter protein structure and function. While metal -ion subst itution has clear ramifications in the context of metal- ion toxicity, changes in protein function upon metal -ion substitution may also constitute a functional strategy. Cu(I) exhibits high affinity for thiolate ligands, suggesting that thiol-rich metallopr otein binding sites may be subject to disruption under elevated copper concentrations. In this context, we report spectroscopic studies that characterize copper(I) binding to several zinc- binding peptides and proteins, including both classical and non- classical zinc finger domains and multiple domains of the X -linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein (XIAP). We demonstrate that both synthetic zinc finger peptides and recombinantly expressed zinc metalloproteins are susceptible to Cu(I) substitution at the zinc binding sites, and that copper substitution results in both structural and functional changes. The results of this work suggest that Cu(I) -substituted zinc finger domains might be relevant in the context of both copper toxicity mechanisms and copper -responsive transcription factors.

According to the oxidative stress hypothesis in AD, the interactions of redox active Cu(II) ions with A peptide is linked to production of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) . While the Cu(II)A ascorbate- assisted redox chemistry toward OH radical production is well characterized, much less is known about the following OH propagation processes . There is a number of possibl e/plausible intramolecular A processes [1] in which the OH radical propagates oxidizing the side chain residues or the peptide bonds.

We investigate at Density functional theory level (DFT) [2 ,3] the OH propagation exploring the intramolecular electron transfer of the three most plausible redox competent Cu(II) -A\u00b7OH coordinations. Then we consider a number of full peptide Cu(II)- A(1-16)\u00b7OH structures to unveil in better detail the energetic and peptide dynamic of the OH propagation. For this latter, long MD simulation sof the Cu(II)- A(1-16)\u00b7OH have been carried out suggesting that OH propagation is Cu(II) coordination dependent . References [1]C.

All domains of life require the essential enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which represents the only pathway for de novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides from ribonucleotides. Class I RNR depends on a ferritin -like R2 subunit to produce a catalytic radical, subsequently shuttled via proton -coupled electron transfer to the R1 subunit performing the ribonucleotide reduction. Except in the recently discovered metal -free subclass Ie [1], R2 utilises a dinuclear metal centre to generate the radical upon O 2activation, via the formation of high -valent intermediates. Distinct subclasses of R2 proteins specifically rely on different dinuclear Mn and/or Fecofactors. In subclass Ic R2 (R2c), a MnII/FeIIheterodinuclear centre initially provides all four electrons required for complete O 2 reduction. It results in a MnIV/FeIVintermediate which undergoes a one- electron reduction to form the MnIV/FeIIIactive state of the protein. Although still debated, the inorganic cores of R2c directly following O2exposure are to date believed to be MnIV(-O)2FeIVand MnIV(-O)( -OH)FeIII. Here, we present our attempts to structurally characterise high -valent states of the R2c Mn/Fe cofactor -ray crystallography and simultaneous X -ray emission spectroscopy (XES) at room temperature at X -ray free -electron laser ( XFEL) sources. Using a drop- protocol [2], we recently obtained high-resolution R2c XFEL crystal structures coupled with Mn and Fe XES data after different times of O 2-exposure. We will discuss how these new structural insights compare with the existing data from the literature.

Previous examples reported by us areorganic macrocycles and cages that show cooperativity between their functional groups [1,2].Recently , we developed animidazole -functionalized cage (see figure), which can act as a ligand for Cu(I) [3]. This results in a T -shaped coordination of copper by the cage ligand reminiscent of the coordination geometry found in copper based enzymatic active sites. This copper complex is able to oxidize benzylic alcohols to aldehydes in the presence of water, em ploying oxygen as the terminal oxidant. In this talk , the mentioned systems will be discussed .

R. China. As anticancer agents, metal complexes have many characteristics compared with small organic molecules. For example, metal complexes have outstanding optical, electrical and magnetic properties, which can be used to prepare multifunctional metal -based anticancer agents. The research of new metal anticancer drugs is of great significance not only for the development of novel anticancer drugs, but also for deepening our understanding of coordination chemistry in life system. These complexes may also be used as a new research tool in cell biology and molecular biology. Based on these considerations, o ur work is concentrated in developing new non- traditional metal- based anticancer drugs in recent years. We mainly carry out research in the following two aspects: (1) The construction of molecular/subcellular organelle -targeted multifunctional phosphoresce nt metal -based anticancer complexes. Based on the coordination structure and optical properties of phosphorescent metal complexes, and the three -dimensional structure of targeted biomolecules, a series of molecular targeted antitumor metal complexes have b een designed. The antitumor mechanism and optical properties of these complexes are organically combined to achieve satisfactory anticancer properties and multifunctionalities . Selective inhibition of the targets at the cellular level, and real- time induct ion and monitoring of the intracellular physiological processes have been simultaneously achieved by using the strategy. For example, b y introducing the organelle -targeting or microenvironment -sensitive groups into the structures of phosphorescent metal co mplexes, we have realized real -time damaging and tracing of mitochondria/lysosomes simultaneously.[1-6]Moreover, w e have designed multifunctional metal- based anticancer agents targeting histone deacetylase incorporating phosphorescent imaging, photodynami c therapy (PDT) and subcellular targeting properties.[7](2) Exploration of the mechanism of programmed cell death induced by metal -based anticancer agents.

It is annotated as IPR019791 in the specialized InterPro databas econtaining numerous representatives from all domains of life. Among them the most intensively investigated are the animal heme peroxidases significantly contributing to innate immunity. It is expected that all members of this large superfamily posses sa typical and unique posttranslational modification within a conserved structural fold that results in peculiar covalent bonds between the heme prosthetic group and highly conserved amino acids of the protein [2].We have performed a detailed phylogenomic analysis of peroxidase gene complement and genome evolution across metazoans . For this purpose we analysed all available cephalochordat egenomes and compared the regions with detected peroxidase genes with similar regions in other metazoan genomes, in particular urochordate and vertebrate genomes. We have identified two gene cluster sin the genome of Branchiostoma belcheri containing co-localized genes coding for thyroid -peroxidase -like proteins and for peroxidas ins. Discovered gene clusters reveal ed synten ywith genome of Drosophila melanogaster .We could follow the synteny pattern of one described cluster up to the human genome where it is located on chromosome #2. All discovered synteny regions contain closely evolutionary related peroxidase genes of the same superfamily IPR019791. Further, t he phylogenetic analysis performed by us with Maximum Likelihood method on 586complete protein sequences revealed a basal position for seven heme peroxidases from cephalochordate (Figure) thus represent ingan important turning point in the complex evolution between vertebrate thyroid peroxidases and peroxidasins.

Nitrogenase is one of the most fascinating enzymes in Nature, being responsible for all biological nitrogen reduction. Despite decades of research the mechanism remains poorly understood. The MoFe protein of nitrogenase contains a metal -sulfur cluster, FeMoco, where N 2reduction takes place. The resting state of FeMoco (E 0) has been characterized by crystallography, multiple spectroscopic techniques (XAS, M \u00f6ssbauer, EPR) and theory (BS -DFT) and its molecular structure c an be considered complete while the complex electronic structure, involving 8 -metal spin coupling, delocalized electrons and weak metal -metal bonding, is not completely understood yet[1- 3]. Much less is known about the other redox states (E 1-E8) where no c rystal structures are available but hydrides have been proposed to be present in the early redox states. We are studying the system via QM/MM models of FeMoco in order to properly incorporate protein environmental effects[4]. Broken -symmetry DFT calculati ons are used to describe the QM region using ORCA. Our calculated structures are in excellent agreement with the high -resolution crystal structure but also reveal a strong sensitivity with respect to electronic structure method .We will present new calculations that go beyond the resting state of the cofactor and will discuss our recent work on characterizing the E 1-E4states of the cofactor and dinitrogen binding.

For sustainable chemistry, protein is one of the promising materials due to the fine -tuned functions accompanied by the sophisticated structures. In this context, our group has demonstrated the chemical approach of modification of hemoproteins toward artif icial metalloenzymes. A heme (porphyrin iron complex) cofactor in hemoprotein is replaced with designed artificial metal complex to modify the reactivities and physicochemical properties of the hemoproteins [1,2] . In this presentation, artificial metallo enzymes for C -H bond hydroxylation will be introduced as shown in Figure [2,3]. Myoglobin is a well- known hemoprotein for oxygen storage, whereas no catalytic activity toward C - H bond hydroxylation is reported in contrast to native hemoenzymes such as cytochrome P450. Recently, our group found that manganese porphycene, an artificial metal porphyrinoid, serves as an active site toward catalytic C -H bond hydroxylation in the reconstituted myoglobin (Figure). The of hydr oxylation of ethylbenzene, toluene and cyclohexane using hydrogen peroxide as a terminal oxidant under mild conditions at pH 7.0 and 25\u00baC. Interestingly, the manganese(V) -oxo species is spectroscopically detectable as an active species in this system and t his species was characterized by EPR. Detailed mechanistic investigation suggests the catalytic hydroxylation by the rate- determining H atom abstraction and following OH -rebound, which is similar to the mechanism found in cytochrome P450. This is the fir st example for myoglobin -based artificial metalloenzyme catalyzing inert C -H bond hydroxylation of external substrate. Further optimization of the protein matrix by the mutations has achieved the significant enhancement of enantioselectivity of the produc t and turnover number of the hydroxylation reactions of the more inert alkane substrates.

High -valent manganese oxygen species have been widely considered as a key intermediate in various oxidative reactions of biological systems. Herein, we present the structure and reactivity of two high - valent manganese reactive oxygen complexes a tetraaza of two amine and two pyridine. These novel intermediates would be prominently valuable for expand ingthe chemistry of transition metal catalysts. Naphthalene oxidation is one of the most difficult reactions in environmental and biological chemistry. We report that a MnIV-bis(hydroxo) complex, [MnIV(TBDAP)(OH) 2]2+, which was fully characterized by various physicochemical methods such as UV -vis, ESI -MS, resonance Raman, EPR, X - ray and XAS, shows the naphthalene oxidation in the pre sence of acid to afford 1,4 -naphthoquinone. Redox titration of the MnIV-bis(hydroxo) complex exhibits one electron reduction potential of 1.09 V, which is the most positive potential for the previously reported nonheme MnIV-bis(hydroxo) species as well as MnIV-oxo analogues. Kinetic studies including kinetic isotope effect suggest that the naphthalene oxidation by the MnIV-bis(hydroxo) complex in the acid- promoted reaction occurs via a rate- determining electron transfer process.

Molecular imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) is a non- invasive technique that provides detailed, quantitative, and clinically power information on cellular and metabolic events. A variety of radiometals with differing nuclear properties have b een produced and studied to date, with most of them requiring a different bifunctional chelator (BFCs) to provide optimal radiolabeling and stability properties. We have designed a new family of high- denticity (maximum CN=12) BFCs based on siderophore desferrioxamine (DFO). of chelators includes those we've named DFO2 (DFT structure pictured below) , DFO2glu, DFO2lys, and DFO2', with a synthetic platform that features simple and rapid synthesis of new derivatives with different properties to enable binding to Zr(IV), Ti(IV), Nb(V), and potentially other radiometals. Although several successful new BFCs for zirconium -89 have been published in recent years, we are designing new BFCs with not only enhanced stability, but a focus on easy synthesis and a modular design for fast synthetic iteration. More importantly - we are investigating the use of EXAFS spectroscopy and DFT computations with the goal of validating and then integra ting these methods with our rapid synthesis platform and traditional radiochemical stability assays to predict the most promising structures. We have performed DFT calculations via ComputeCanada (SharcNet, Graham) and compared results obtained the functionals B3LYP 31G+(d,p), Def2TZVP, and SDD - and used experimentally determined bond -length values from EXAFS spectroscopy as standards to select the most accurate computation method for our application (PCM used to model solvent effects). We have also compared these results to calculations performed on our own local computer system running Materials Studio (DMol3/GGA/PBE). The purpose of this work is to determine the most accurate computation method for predicting the metal- ligand bond lengths of these compounds using the very accurate bond length values determined via EXAFS spectroscopy as references. Preliminary zirconium -89 radiolabeling and stability assays have demonstrated that complexes of several of our new chelators are more stable than the \"gold standard\" chelator desferrioxamine Conjugation of model antibody trastuzumab and in vivo studies in mice are currently ongoing to determine the [89Zr]Zr -chela te stability by monitoring bone uptake over time . We hope to be able to correlate trends between EXAFS/DFT/radiochemical stability results with this first generation of chelators and use this information to more efficiently design new chelators in the future.

Epoxide (oxirane) functional group is widely distributed in numerous nature products, which display a broad spectrum of biological activities, including antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antitumor activities [1,2] . In nature, two strategies a re utilized to install epoxide: 1) a formal dehydrogenation by cleaving a C -H and an O -H bond on two adjacent carbons, and 2) an oxygen atom transfer (OAT) reaction onto an olefin moiety of the substrate. Mecha nistic understandings of the latter strategy (OAT) are largely derived from studies of choloroperoxidases (CPOs), cytochrome heme iron model complexes [3-5]. It is generally accepted that th e OAT reactivity exhibited by high-valent iron species is strongly electrophilic in nature, and epoxide ring could be formed in a stepwise manner via a discrete radical or cation species, or in a concerted mechanism. However , the mechanistic details on how non-heme iron enzyme cataly zed epoxidation through the OAT strategy is less well understood. AsqJ from Aspergillus nidulans is a recently discovered Here we recent studies on the mechanism of the epoxidation cataly zed by AsqJ. Using transient state kinetics and M\u00f6ssbauer spectr oscopy, we demonstrate that an Fe(IV)=O intermediate is responsible for the oxygen installation to the C3 -C10 double bond of the AsqJ substrate. However, this Fe(IV)=O species does not exhibit strong electrophilicity towards the electron rich olefin moiety of the substrate , a reactivity behavior in contrast with many high -valent iron species. More interestingly, crystallographic data reveal a unique iron -alkoxide species between the iron center and the C10 of the substrate. With additional DFT calculations and molecular dynamic simulations, a detailed mechanism of AsqJ cataly zed epoxidation is revealed.

E-mail: weiwei @nju.edu.cn Thesolar-to-chemical production by artificial and bioinspired photosynthetic systems is of tremendous interest to help solve current global energy and environmental problems. We developed a bioinorganic hybrid system for photocatalytic hydrogen production under aerobic conditions by combining light -harvesting semico nductors, hydrogenase catalysis, and self- aggregation of whole bacterial cells. We induced hydrogen production via selfphotosynthesis in engineered Escherichia coli cells, which were originally designed for bioremediation, with in situ biosynthesis of bioc ompatible cadmium sulfide nanoparticles using a surface -display system. This biohybrid catalytic approach may serve as a general strategy for solar -to-chemical production. Figure 1. Surface -display biohybrid approach to light -driven hydrogen production in air.

Nature has developed a variety of enzymes that contain transition metal cofactors to activate O 2; thus, metalloenzyme -catalyzed reactions typically proceed with unrivaled efficiencies under ambient conditions. The majority of O 2-activating wild -type enzymes utilize Fe and Cu in their active sites, whereas a few of them feature Mn. Two f orms of homoprotocatechuate 2,3- dioxygenases active -HPCD the native enzymes with nonphysiological metal ions, all exhibit comparable catalytic activity [ 3,4].Therefore, it has long been believed that tra nsition metal -catalyzed oxidative transformations share common mechanistic features, in which O 2initially binds to a reduced metal center to form an oxidized metal -superoxo species, which functions as the reagent to perform subsequent chemistry [5,6]. Upo n mixing of O 2to Mn -HPCD, two intermediates were trapped and characterized by EPR spectroscopy. They were assigned to a MnIIIion coordinated by an unidentified radical, assumed to be a superoxo, and a MnII-alkylperoxo species, but the conclusive evidence remains elusive [7]. In addition, well -defined MnIII-superoxo complexes remain rather rare. Recently, two MnIII-superoxo complexes, Mn(BDPP)(O 2-) (2) and Mn(BDPBrP)(O 2-) (2) were prepared. Herein, we would like to present the reactivity of the MnIII-superoxo complexes. Financial support by the Ministry of Science and Technology ,Taiwan is gratefully acknowledged. References [1]M. A.

Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are main treatments for cancer. However, their side effects and resistance limited their clinical use. On the other hand, na nomedicine, the area of interdisciplinary science, applies nanotechnology to health and medicine [ 1]. First, we demonstrate that how nanotechnology overcomes platinum drug resistance [2 ]. The platinum prodrug was designed and tethered onto surface of gold nanorods. The designed delivery system can overcome resistance through increasing drug uptake and decreasing drug deactivation. We also used nanomedicine strategy to deliver chemotherapy drugs, such as Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, to sensitize radiotherapy through inhibiting DNA repair [ 3]. Second, we developed a multifunctional platform with controlled activat ion of platinum prodrug using near infrared (NIR) light and with real -time evaluation of drug efficacy [ 4]. The ultraviolet (UV) light sensitive platinum prodrug was synthesized and conjugated onto surface of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). Upon absorbing NIR light, UCNPs convert it into UV light, which activates platinum prodrug, release active components and then induce cancer cells apoptosis. Meanwhile, an apoptosis -imaging probe was also conjugated onto UCNPs. Once NIR light irradiated UCNPs, cancer cells apoptos is was triggered, which unleashed the release of enzyme, caspase -3 and subsequently activate the imaging probe. Therefore, the direct imaging of apoptosis in living cells can be for real -time evaluation of drug efficacy. Finally, yet importantly, nowadays immunotherapy generates promising clinical data that have not seen before. It showed that combining radiotherapy and immunotherapy can enhance immune responses and can boost 'abscopal effect'. Unfortunately, response rates for this strategy remain low. Her ein we utilizes antigen -capturing nanoparticles (AC -NPs) to improve this strategy [ 5]. Our engineered AC -NPs can capture a set of protein antigens released post radiotherapy and it helped an tigen presentation, which eventually induce enhanced immune responses and enhance 'abscopal effect'.

Because biological systems are both complex and fluxional, context is vitally imp ortant for such measurements in order for them to be accurate. Correlation of measurements through space and time can provide such quantitative assessments. Metallic nanoparticles pose many challenges for measurement in cellular systems. The metal can inte rfere with the detection method and the particles can change in size and shape over time and in association with different biological molecules.1 At the National Research Council we seek to correlate detailed physical characterization of silver nanoparticl es with biological measurements to generate methods for measuring the impact of nanosilver on different cell types and quantifying the specific interactions of nanosilver with biological molecules.2,3 Correlating changes in nanoparticles over time in biolo gical fluids helps to provide an understanding of nanoparticle behaviour and results in higher reproducibility of observed biological endpoints. Surface coatings play a pivotal role in recognition of the particles by cellular receptors suggesting active tr ansport plays a critical role in the nanosilver life cycle.2 Physical and chemical differences between silver nanoparticles and changes that occur in biological test media can be correlated to toxicity, and different mechanisms for toxicity are apparent. U ptake rates and localization is also different between different cell lines. Uptake and localization of particles provides evidence that nanosilver should not be treated as a single material but should be studied as an array of materials with different pro perties in different biological systems.

OP-46 Construction and Function of Biomimetic Diiron Nitrogen Fixation System s Dawei Yang1,Baomin Wang1,Jingping Qu1 1State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian 116024, P. R. China. Nitrogen fixation, which converts inert dinitrogen (N 2) to ammonia (NH 3), is a process of fundamental importance both in nature and for modern society. The Haber -Bosch ammonia synthesis process as one of the greatest inventions of the 2 0thcentury poses many serious environment and energy problems because of its harsh reaction conditions. In sharp contrast, nitrogenase can catalyze N 2 reduction to NH 3under ambient conditions. Hence, it is effective to adopt biomimetic strategy for developing mild ammonia synthesis technology. Based on the belt diiron structure of FeMo -cofactor as the potential active center of nitrogenase, we designed and constructed a series of novel thiolate -bridged diiron complexes as nitrogenase m imics. By cooperative activation effect between the two iron centers, we mainly focused on functional transformation of small molecules, especially biomimetic chemical nitrogen fixation. Firstly, catalytic NN cleavage of hydrazine compounds was realized t o release corresponding amines and ammonia [1]. Secondly, we presented a detailed biological nitrogen fixation process from diazene (NH=NH) to ammonia in biomimetic diiron scaffold [2]. Based on these findings, we firstly proposed a new biological nitrogen fixation mechanism in the diiron active center. Besides, we also extend our work to biomimetic catalytic transformation of other inert small molecules [3-6].

Energy harvested directly from sunlight offers a desirable approach toward fulfilling the global need for clean energy with minimal environmental impact. Marinescu group focuses on fundamental research to understand, design, and synthesize novel catalytic systems essential to the development of efficient solar -to-fuel technologies. Inspired by biological systems, we develop molecular catalysts that involve hydrogen- bonding networks capable of small molecule activation, through multiple proton and electron transfers. We have shown that cobalt complexes with pendant secondary amines (NH groups) act as highly efficient catalysts for the reduction of CO 2to CO in compar ison to the alkylated versions. This results suggests that the presence of the pendant NH moi ety is crucial for catalysis. We have recently synthesized a series of cobalt -centered CO 2-to-CO reduction catalysts, with 0 to 4 pendant secondary amines. We have demonstrated that the rate of catalysis has a direct correlation with the number of pendant protic moieties. Theory and experiment suggest that the pendant secondary amines (NH groups) do not directly transfer protons to CO 2, but instead bind acid molecules from solution. Taken together, these results suggest a mechanism in which noncooperative p endant amines facilitate a hydrogen -bonding network that enables direct proton transfer from acid to the activated CO 2substrate, providing a relevant model for biological systems.

The acquisition of iron is an essential process for the establishment of virulence among virtually all pathogens [1,2] . Under acidic and/or anaerobic conditions, such as those found in the stomach, the intestines, and within biofilms, the majority of pathogens utilize the ferrous iron (Fe2+) uptake (Feo) system to import Fe2+ in order to fulfill their requirement for iron. The Feo system is the most widely distributed prokaryotic Fe2+ import pathway, and its presence is required for normal growth of most unicellular organisms [3]. The Feo system is poorly understood at the atomic, molecular, and mechanistic levels, which has prohibited the targeting of this system for bacterial exploits and represents a pressing and urge nt gap in the field of bacterial metal homeostasis. While the main membrane component of the Feo system (FeoB) is essential for the translocation of ferrous iron, the small, cytosolic proteins FeoA and FeoC are postulated to function as accessories to this process, but their roles remain poorly defined. In this work, we are the first to demonstrate that Escherichia coli FeoC ( EcFeoC) binds an [Fe -S] cluster, and we spectroscopically and biophysically characterize the nature of this cluster. Under strictly anaerobic conditions, we demonstrate that EcFeoC binds a redox -active and rapidly oxygen -sensitive [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster, in distinct contrast to the only previous study on FeoC from Klebsiella pneumoniae [4]. Importantly, we show that this cluster binding i s associated with modest conformational changes of the polypeptide but not protein dimerization. We posit a working hypothesis in which the cluster -binding FeoCs may function as in vivo iron sensors to fine -tune ferrous pathogenic iron acquisition. References [1] S. C. Andrews, A. K.

Zurich, Switzerland. richard.cunha@ chem.uzh.ch The driving factors of nucleic acids folding are the stability of base -base and cation -mediated electrostatic interactions. In particular, Mg2+ions strongly bind to RNA molecules promoting the formation of tertiary contacts and even specific functional motifs. As an example, a recurring tertiary contact of the group II intron family the 5 -exon- intron binding site interaction (EBS1 -(d)IBS1), can only be stably formed upon addition of Mg2+ion or under very high concentration of monovalent cations of the RNA cognate only. Although not in the same way, but the effect is observed for both RNA -RNA and RNA -DNA pairs. FRET and NMR studies suggest that cations interfere not only with the stability of the EBS1 -(d)IBS1 in teraction but also with the kinetics by inducing heterogeneity. In other terms, there is a multi -state folding regulated by Mg2+specific binding site occupancy [1 -3]. In this work we utilize molecular dynamics simulations powered by a combination of many state -of-the-art enhanced sampling techniques to characterize the structural and thermodynamics effects of Mg2+and K+binding on the homo and heteroduplex binding motifs. This simulation allows for the determination of relative binding affinities of divalent metal ions such as Mg2+and the effects of ion competition. The highest affinity binding sites identified in the simulations corroborate with the propo sed by NMR experiments. Preliminary results indicate that there are specific ion -induced conformational changes in the backbone of the RNA -RNA pair that further stabilize the tertiary contact formation while the same doesn't happen for its RNA -DNA counterp art. The combination of simulations and experiments provide a multi -lateral description in an atomistic level of the 5 -exon- intron binding ranging from its thermodynamics to the kinetics including non- trivial effects arising from RNA -ions binding.

Polyoxometalates (POMs) and POM -based hybrid and nanocomposite structures have become of increasing interest in medicine due to thei r antibacterial and anticancer activities [1,2] . namely MnV 11, MnV 13 and V10 Escherichia coli growth. It was observed that Mn V11 presents the lowest growth inhibition (G I50) value folowed by MnV 13 compound and being about 2 times lower than V 10, respectively the values obtained were 0.21, 0.27 and 0.58 mM. All three compounds were more effective than vanadate alone (GI 50=1.1 mM) and also than decaniobate, Nb 10 (GI 50>10 mM ), a isostructural POM of V 10. However, POVs exhibiting the highest antibacterial activity (Mn V11) shows the ( IC50 = 58 \u00b5M) whereas decavanadate, which was also active against this P -type ATPase ( IC50=15 \u00b5M), was the less active against Escherichia coli growth. Thus, for the analyzed POVs it was observed a reverse correlation between the Ca2+- ATPase IC 50 values and the Escherichia coli GI50 values suggesting that decavanadate and others POVs inhibitors of ion pumps cannot be directly associated with the inhibition of Escherichia coli growth . Nevertheless, although the biological processes affected in bacteria by each POMs are yet to be clarified , ion pumps as well known molecular targets for drugs and poly oxometalates should be taken in consideration once they are directly or indirectly involve d in bacterial celll death [3,4] .

Hydrogenases are enzymes that catalyze the oxidation and generation of molecular hydrogen in a highly efficient and reversible manner. While [NiFe] hydrogenases are the most common in nature, it is the [FeFe] hydrogenases that are the most active, but at the same time they are the most oxygen - sensitive.[1,2] The active site of [FeFe] hydrogenases consists of the H -cluster, which is constructed from a canonical [4Fe- 4S] sub -cluster coupled to a unique [2Fe] sub- cluster containing a unique bridging azapropane dithiolate as well as carbonyl and cy anide ligands. [3-5]Exposure of the active enzyme to O 2 results in rapid irreversible activity loss. [6] The enzyme from the sulfate -reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (DdHydAB) is of the most active and bidirectional [FeFe] hydrogenases . An additional interesting feature of DdHydAB is that it can be purified aerobically in an oxygen -stable inactive state called H inact.This state can be converted into the active oxidized state H ox, ready to bind H 2and enter the catalytic cycle. Recently , we have been able to generate the H inact state under oxidizing conditions in the presence of sulfide, suggesting that sulfide coordinates to the [2Fe] sub -cluster .To investigate the structure of the enzyme in the H inactstate, we have crystallized DdHydAB and solved its structure to 1.5 \u00c5 .The structure clearly shows electron density in the open coordination site of the distal Fe, demonstrating the presence of sulfide. Thesedata aresupported by resonance Raman and nuclear resonance vibrational spectra of samples using natural abundance and 34S isotopically labelled sulfide source s.The formation of the oxygen -stable state in vitro allows the handling of hydrogenases in air, making their implementation in biotechnological applications more feasible.

Among the reported P450s, CYP102A1 (P450BM3) isolated from Bacillus megaterium has garnered much attention because of its high monooxygenase activity. In general, P450BM3 displays a high substrate specificity, exclusively catalyzing the hydroxylation of long -alkyl -chain fatty acids while remaining inactive for small non -native substrates such as propane and benzene. However, it was observed t hat P450BM3 can be \"fooled\" into initiating hydroxylation of non- native substrates in the presence of perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCs), which function as inert dummy substrates (decoy molecules). PFCs initiate the activation of molecular oxygen in th e same manner as with long -alkyl -chain fatty acids and induce the generation of compound I, but the compound I hydroxylates gaseous alkanes and benzene because the C - F bonds of PFCs are not oxidizable.1.2 We have succeeded in developing the next generation of decoy molecules by modifying the carboxylate of PFCs with amino acids and succeeded in enhancing the catalytic activity for gaseous alkanes.3Amongst the next generation of decoy molecules examined, N- perfluoro nonano yl-L-leucine (PFC9 -L-Leu) was the mo st effective for hydroxylation of propane (256/min/P450). Furthermore, we have succeeded in crystallizing the N -perfluoro nonano yl-L-tryptophan (PFC9 -L-Trp)- bound form of P450BM3. PFC9 -L-Trp-bound form of P450BM3 (PDB code: 3WSP) showed that the terminal of alkyl chain does not reach to the active site owing to the multiple hydrogen bonding interactions between the carboxyl and carbonyl groups of PFC9- L-Trp and amino acids (Tyr -51, Gln -73, and Ala -74) located at the entrance of P450BM3. More recently, we have demonstrated that various carboxylic acids modified with amino acids ( N-acyl amino acids) as well as amino acid dimers having a completely different structure from fatty acids can serve as decoy molecules.4We also have confirmed that wild-type cytochrome P450BM3 (P450BM3) expressed in E.coli can be activated b y adding amino acid derivatives as decoy molecules to the culture medium and benzene was hydroxylated without supplementing with NADPH.5The yield kami, O.

We have explored the possibility of using organometallic derivatives of cobalamin as a scaffold for the delivery of the same antimalarial drug to both erythro - and hepatocytes. This hybrid molecule approach [1], intended as a possible tool for the development of multi -stage antimalarial agent s [2], pivots on the preparation of azide- functionalized drugs which, after coupling to the vitamin, are released with a 4-(4-ethynylphenyl) -triazole functionality. Three chloroquine and one imidazolopiperazine derivative (based on the KAF156 structure) [3] were selected as model drugs. One hybrid chloroquine conjugate (B12 -JR1) was extensively studied via fluorescent labelling for in vitro and in vivo bio-distribution studies and gave proof -of-concept for the design. It showed no toxicity in vivo (zebrafis h model) as well as no hepatotoxicity, no cardiotoxicity or developmental toxicity of the embryos. All 4 -(4- ethynylphenyl) -triazole derivatives of chloroquine drugs into a solution of strictly monomeric ferriprotoporphyrin IX indicates that the molecules might exert their antiplasmodial activity by promoting ferriprotoporphyrin \u00b5 -oxo IX dimer equilibrium .

OP-58 Structural B asis of Iron Reduction by Human Duodenal C ytochrome b(Dcyt b) Involved in Intestinal Iron of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Centre f or Blood Research, University of British Columbia, Canada. Duodenal cytochrome b(Dcyt b) is an Fe3+reductase that was identified in the duodenal brush border. Since the metal transporter DMT -1 favors the absorption of divalent metal including Fe2+, the reduction of Fe3+to Fe2+by Dcytb in the duodenum is essential for effective intestinal iron absorption. Dcytb is an integral membrane protein that catalyzes reduction of nonheme Fe3+by electron transfer from ascorbate across the membrane. Here we report the crystallographic structures of human Dcyt band its complex with ascorbate and Zn2+[1]. Each monomer of the homodimeric transmembrane helices and cytoplasmic and groups, as well as cytoplasmic and apical ascorbate- binding sites located adjacent to each heme. Zn2+coordinates to two hydroxyl groups of the apical ascorbate and to a histidine residue. Biochemical analysis indicates that Fe3+competes with Zn2+for this binding site. The identification of the metal binding site on Dcyt bthat is located adjacent to the apical binding site for ascorbate provides structural evidence for cytochrome b561family involvement in metal ion reduction. The cooperative binding of ascorbate and Zn2+to the apical substrate binding site in the Dcyt b structure reveals key mechanistic insight intoDcyt bfunction Yamashita, K. Hirata, Y. Nariai, T.

The development of novel antibiotics is being outpaced by the development of bacterial strains with resista nce to them, including the often lethal, hospital 'superbug' MRSA. This is a problem that will continue to be exacerbated due to increasing global population and high density living facilitating the spread of contagious diseases. Therefore, an alternative approach, which impedes the develop ment of resistance, is required [1]. The development of new antibiotics has been mostly focussed on the discovery and modification of purely organic molecules. However, m etallodrugs may possess distinct advantages over conventional organic antibiotics ,including new targets, new modes of action, a greatly increased range of available geometries ,and targeted activity through light or redox activation [2,3]. We are particularly interested in the use of transition metals for targeted drug delivery to bacterial cells. A major advantage of such targeted delivery is the ability to achieve a higher local concentration in the target cells , despite maintaining a low er systemic concentration .A higher local concentration reduces the chance of partially resistant organisms remaining viable and reproducing, while a lower systemic concentration could reduce possible side -effects as well as combating the spread of resista ncethrough other mechanisms such as horizontal gene tran sferfrom non -pathogenic bacteria. In this work, CuAAC used to synthesise sulfonamide ligands as well complexes of them (See fi gure) . Interestingly, the inclusion of a hydroxymethyl group ortho to the nitrogen atom on the coordinating pyridine ring increased the rate of ligand exchange up to 100 -fold relative to the unsubstituted ligand. Subsequent structural characterisation indicated the increased (photo)lability is primarily due to steric factors. Furthermore, t he metal complexes showed improved antibacterial activity relative to a clinical analogue (sulfamethoxazole) in MRSA strains which are resistant to sulfonamide -based anti biotics [4].

Examples of such metalloenzymes include purple acid alkaline phosphatase and agent [1,2] . The latter show zinc ions in their active sites. Aiming the development of new mimetic compounds for phosphatase enzymes , we are describing herein the synthesis of a new heptadentat e unsymmetrical ligand and its first dinuclear zinc complex. ligand was built on the 1,3 -diamino propan -2-ol backbone contains two methyl pyrid yl and two propyl amide groups as pendant arms. Both ligand and complex were characterized by IR, 1H, 13C,15N NMR . The x- ray molecular structure revealed the format ion of a dinuclear zinc complex. Both zinc centres are penta coordinate, showing a trigonal -bipyramidal geometry. The zinc ions are bridged by an acetate and an alkoxo bridge. Zn(1) is also coordinated by one tertiary amine and two pyridine groups. On the other hand, Zn(2) is coordinated by one tertiary amine and two amide groups. Although the ligand is unsymmetrical , the bond distan ces around Zn(1) and Zn(2) are very similar. The longest bond (2.222(5) \u00c5) and Zn(1)- O(1) and Zn(2)- O(2), which show the same (1.994(3) \u00c5). The Zn(1) -N(1) are 2.024(4) and 2.028(4) \u00c5, respectively. The Kinetic studies carried out at different pH values (6-11) showed that the optimal activity is at pH 9.0 , and, therefore, k inetic studies were carried out at this pH employing bis(2,4- dinitrophenyl)phosphate as substrate , at 25oC . T he data were fitted to the Michaelis -Menten equation. The kinetic studies resulted in V max= 2.52\u00b10.42 x10-6 M-1 min-1, Km k cat/Km = 0.89 M-1 min-1. This new compound was less active than the symmetrical one previously reported by us [3], which contains four methyl pyridil groups attached to 1,3 -diaminepropan -2-ol backbone, indicating that the unsymmetrical ligand did not improve the catalytic activity of the zinc complex.

Candidates for new drugs have faced many drawbacks, particularly due to their toxic side effects, calling for new strategies for selectivity . Among the option savailable ,the use of light as a controlled trigger stands out [1]. Photo -uncaging of compounds have been widely explored with the release of biological active molecules , generation of ROS/RNI species ,among others [2-5]. Here, we prepared a metal complex by conjugating a ruthenium(II) moiety linkage. Since 50s, isoniazid has been used a s the first choice drug in a cocktail for the treatment of tuberculosis [6]. However, isoniazid -resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis have emerged mainly by disrupting isoniazid activation step. This process of enzymatic activation requires an oxidative step with production of a key species, an isonicotinoyl radical [6]. Our proof -of-concept complex was designed to work by photochemically generating a strong oxidative reactive species ( singlet oxygen) that would disrupt the acyl hydrazone bond. This process would leads to the formation of the isonicotinoyl radical, bypassing he enzymatic route of activation .Thus, a n isoniazid conjuga ted ruthenium complex was prepared by characterized by HPLC, elemental analysis and mass spectrometry confirming its formulation and purity . Interestingly, this complex was stable in the dark in a broad range of pH s(3-10)for at least 15 h at 25 oC.However, blue light irradiation caused a quick disruption of that linkage originating isonicotinic acid and a trisbipyridine ruthenium(II) derivative complex as final products ,as monitored by HPLC and MS. EPR measurements using PBN trap upon blue light irradiation showed a profile consistent to a isonicotinoyl radical. Singlet oxygen production was also measu red by using DPBF probe . In addition to DNA electrophoresis assay a singlet -oxygen -dependent cleavage of DNA. Biological assays were carried out u sing four bacterial strains ( S. aureus, S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa, E. coli ), where asno activity was observ ed in the dark, but blue light irradiation led to a promising microcidal activity (e.g. S. aureus +light MIC = 7.6 mol L-1).Cytotoxicit y assays also showed low E C50(> 50 gmL-1), which increased upon shining blue light only in cancer cell line (LNCAP ,prostate adenocarcinoma) . Altogether, these results support our approach ,validating an acyl hydrazone linkage as a promising strategy to photochemical generation of activated species. Financial support by CNPq ( L. G. F.

Carbon dioxide conversions mediated by transition metal complexes continue to attract much attention due to its potential utilization as a C1 source for the future industry. One of the main challenges in transition metal -based CO 2catalysis is to accomplish the high selectivity in producing a desired product. This may rely on the interaction of CO 2with a metal center. Given the presence of nickel in natural systems that allow for extremely efficient catalysis, studies that focus on selective CO 2conversion to CO with synthetic nickel species are currently of considerable interest in our group .The chemist ry is inspired by an efficient enzymatic CO 2catalysis occurring at the active site of the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH). Since the binding and reactivity toward CO 2is controlled in part by the geometry of a L 3Ni scaffold, we have explored the chem istry of low -valent nickel supported by pincer systems (E = P or N), in which a pseudo- tetrahedral or square planar geometry is accommodated. The central donor atom is P for a PPMeP ligand (PPMeP = C- 4)2}{(PNP)NiCO 2}, demonstrate that the geometry of a nickel ion is crucial in the binding of CO 2and its level of activation. In the case of a square planar nickel center, a series of bimetallic metallacarboxylate Ni--CO 2-C,O-M species (M = H, Na, Ni or Fe) were synthesized and studied. Protonation cleaves the C-O bond in the nick el(II)- carboxylate species resulting in the formation of a nickel(II) monocarbonyl complex. By sequential reduction, the corresponding mono- and zero -valent Ni -CO species were generated. In particular, a (PNP)Ni(0) -CO species shows immediate reactivity tow ard CO 2but displays the formation of multiple products. With a structurally rigidified acriPNP ligand, the Ni(0) -CO species reveals the selective addition of CO 2to give a nickel(II) -carboxylate species with the expulsion of CO.

Metalloenzymes are biological catalysts responsible for carrying out critical chemical reactions in the cell. Usually, metalloenzymes are highly selective in their reactivity. However, so me metalloenzymes are catalytically promiscuous and are capable of catalyzing several different reactions. While numerous synthetic mimics of metalloenzymes active sites have been developed and their ability to catalyze biomimetic reactions investigated, the scope of their catalytic promiscuity has often not been extensively characterized. In order to obtain greater insight into the catalytic promiscuity of metalloenzymes and their synthetic mimics, we have assembled a panel of fluorogenic substrates and pr ofiled the hydrolase activity of a series of metalloenzymes and metalloenzyme mimics against the panel. Using this approach, we find that, for example, a zinc -binding three -helix bundle peptide designed as a mimic of carbonic anhydrase also exhibits protea se activity on a small peptide substrate. We anticipate that the approach outlined here will be useful for investigating the catalytic activities of a wide variety of metallohydrolase mimics. 310 311 ICBIC-19 ICBIC-19 Oral Presentations Oral Presentations Book of Abstracts Book of AbstractsOP-65 New H alf-Sandwich M etalComplexes as Proteosynthesis Barcelona s/n, Santiago de Compostela, Spain. 3Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v.v.i., Kralovopolska 135, 612 65 Murcia, E -30071- Murcia, Spain.

N. punctiforme expresses the NiFe uptake hydrogenase HupSL under nitrogen -fixing conditions. HupSL is composed of two subunits: HupL, containing the NiFe active site, and HupS, comprising three iron- sulfur (FeS) clusters [1,2]. HupS possesses unique non- cysteinyl FeS co ordinating proximal clusters: and Gln in the distal one. The effect of these unusual motifs on the properties of the clu sters is to this date unknown. We have previously isolated and characterized HupS as the fusion protein f -HupS by expression in E. coli [1]. By modifying the proximal [4Fe -4S] cluster by introducing the designed mutation C12P, we found a new paramagnetic species at the proximal cluster site consistent with a [4Fe- 4S] to [3Fe -4S] cluster conversion [2]. When C12P -HupSL was expressed in N. punctiforme, the strain had a consistently higher H 2production than the background hupSL mutant. We concluded that the increase in H 2 production was due to the modification of the pr oximal iron -sulfur cluster, leading to a turn of the electron flow in the enzyme [2]. In the present work, we replaced Asn15 with histidine and cysteine, respectively. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of the modified N15H and N15C version s of f -HupS shows that while all three [FeS] clusters are present in the protein, the proximal cluster has acquired a different structure. To assess the reduction potentials of the FeS clusters in these mutant variants, we used protein - film voltammetry. Th e cyclic voltammogram, in a span of -600 -+200 mV, showed two electrode reactions close to 0 V vs. SHE. While we reproducibly detected the reduced [4Fe- 4S] clusters by EPR spectroscopy, we did not record any currents at more reducing potentials. The volta mmogram for the N15H mutant displayed a shift of the oxidative peak current, indicating that this mutation had an effect o n electron transfer in f -HupS. By engineering the electron transfer chain in HupSL it is possible to tune the redox potentials of th e three FeS clusters in the small subunit. Our aim is to understand and control the direction of the electron transfe r to and from the active site, in order to design and create robust H 2-producing cyanobacterial strains. References [1]P.

In this work the results of the study on the interaction of GLDA with molybdenum (VI) were reported. This metal is essential for nitrogen fixation, normal growth and health of a nimals, plants and microorganisms. It is a key component of the active site in an extensive range of enzymes that catalyse important rea ctions in the carbon, nitrogen, sulphur, selenium and arsenic cycles of the biosphere. Human metabolism involves several molybdenum enzymes, making it an essential trace element in our diet. In particular the interaction of GLDA with molybdenum (VI) was studied at pH = 6.00, T = 298.15 K , anddifferent ionic byusing UV data were modelled according to theextended Debye -H\u00fcckel and specific ion interaction models and for the formation constant (MoO 3GLDA4) in pure water we found a value of 18.96 in the molal concentration scale. Also a case study has been done in which the concentration of 10-6 mol.dm-3has been used for the modelling of the molybdenum speciation in urine. [1] When we consider the simultaneous presence of Mo (VI) (0.000001 mol .dm-3) and GLDA (0.000001 mol .dm-3) in the urine model at pH = 6, we have the 100% of the Mo(VI) complexed as ( MoO 3GLDA4-)species. [1]Only few data of formation constants with molybdate are present for some aminopolycarboxylates .Acorrelation between nN*nCOOH involved in the protonation with constants (ionic strength 0.1 -0.2 mol.dm-3)of ligands -Mo(VI) was done and a fairly good correlation Y = 17.95 + 0.2083* Xwith a R2= 0.9213, ( Yand Xrepresents the formation constants and nN*nCOOH respectively )was found. [1] If we apply the correlation for instance in our case with GLDA, we found a value of 18.78 (at ~0.1 mol.dm-3) that is completely acceptable with the Presentations Book of Abstracts Book of AbstractsOP-69 Enzyme -Inspired Synthetic Auxiliary P 382355 , India . 2Biological Gandhinagar, Palaj, 382355 , India. The Cobaloxime complexes containing axial pyridines typically moderate H 2production catalysis. The hydrogen -bonded oxime -functionality present in the ligand framework acts as the primary proton channel to tune its catalytic reactivity. However, this proton channel collapses under acidic condition s (pH < 5) and limits the H 2production by Cobaloximes only under neutral condition (pH ~7) in water. Here, in this work, we have included variable combinations of peripheral protic groups (such as secondary amine, carboxylic acid, and phenolic- OH) around the same Cobaloxime core that were appended through an axial pyridine ligand. The strategic incorporation of these protic groups surrounding the cobalt center significantly improved (~2.0 -9.5 times) their electrocatalytic H 2production while expanding the active chemical space for H 2production even into the acidic aqueous conditions (pH 3- 7). The three dimensional crystallographic data along with the detailed one -and two -dimensional NMR studies have revealed the formation of an intricate hydrogen -bonding network between the peripheral basic functionalities and specifically positioned water and chloride molecules. This hydrogen bonding nexus generated a water mediated auxiliary proton channel around the Cobaloxime skeleton to play a pivotal role in their significantly improved catalytic activity. These results highlight that the catalytic activity of the artificial catalysts can be fine -tuned by the proper incorporation of enzyme -inspired, outer coordination sphere features around a synthetic catalyst framew ork.

OP-70 -Carboline C opper(II) Complexes as Novel Mcl -1 Inhibitors and In Vitro and In Vivo Activity in Cancer Models Xing Lu1, Liu1, Chris Orvig2, Hong Liang1 1State Key Laboratory for Chemistry and Molecular Engineering of Medicinal Resources, School of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Guangxi Normal University, Guilin 541004, P. R. China. chenzf@gxnu.edu.cn 2Department of Chemistry , Faculty of Science, The University of British Columbia , 2036 Main Mall Vancouver, BC Canada V6T1Z1. Mcl-1 (myeloid cell leukemia 1 ) is an anti -apoptotic member of Bcl -2 family of proteins [1,2]. It plays an important role in the survival of a variety of cancer cells. However, the development of inhibitor s of Mcl-1 has been challenging. Up to now, no metal -based Mcl-1inhibitor has been reported [3-5]. To develop metal -based Mcl -1inhibitors, twenty three 9 -substituted -carboline derivatives 224 were designed and synthesized . In addition, twenty two corresponding copper (II) complexes 2546 were synthesized and characterized. Complexes 38 and 39 showed higher cytotoxicity than the corresponding ligands or cisplatin in vitro. The most potent c omplex 39 selectiv ely inhibited Mcl- 1 with and killed tumor cells by Bax/Bak mediated apoptosis. C omplex 39 showed a profile for selectivity binding to Mcl- 1 with 795- fold versus Bcl -w, and 356- fold versus A1/Bfl - 1, respectively. Complex 39 showed an excellent safety profile in mouse model. Moreover, complex 39 significantly inhibited the tumor growth in NCI-H460 tumor bearing model with an inhibitory rate of 56.6% (P<0.001). Complex 39 prolonged the survival time of the tumor bearing mice. Thus, complex 39 , the first metal -based Mcl -1 inhibitor, may have the potential to be further developed as an antitumor agent with high efficacy and low toxicity.

Carbon monoxide has been demonstrated to exhibit several beneficial effects on biological targets (anti-inflammatory, anti- proliferative, anti -apoptotic effects , causes vasodilation, etc.).1 Consequently, the development of CO releasing molecules (CORMs) that allows a controlled release ofCO under physiological conditions has therefore become a major field of scientific and medical interest.2Considerable research interest has been drawn on light -activated CORMs (photoCORMs) which only release CO upon radiation with certain wavelengths. However, despite a large number of photoCORMs reported, relatively little information is available on the precise mechanism of CO release from most photoCORMs and even less compounds have been tested as anti -cancer agents in cells so far. Herein, we report the synthesis of ruthenium(II) carbonyl di quinolyl ligands (2) and investigate the mechanism of CO release in aqueous media (before and after light -activation). The photo -induced CO release kinetics of the Ru(II) photoCORMs, as well as in vitro studies in cancerous and healthy cell lines will be presented [3].

Crystal structures have shown the presence of copper(II) ion in a characteristic flat, solv ent exposed, active -site in the AA9 family of LPMOs [1]. The function of LPMO has been the subject of debate. In the established model, this class of enzymes was considered to be monooxygenases. However, this view is now challenged by new data indicating that both O 2and H 2O2may function as co -substrates [2]. Here, we report a long- lived intermediate ( t\u00bd= 6 - 8 minutes) observed in an LPMO from Thermoascus aurantiacus (TaLPMO9A) . The intermediate has a strong absorption peak around 420 nm and is formed when reduced LPMO -Cu(I) reacts resonance (EPR), stopped- flow spectroscopy indicate that the observed long -lived intermediate involves the copper site and a nearby tyrosine (Tyr175). Addit ion of sub -equimolar amount of H 2O2to reduced TaLPMO9A boosts oxidation of phosphoric acid swollen cellulose which suggests that the long -lived copper -dependent intermediate is part of the catalytic mechanism for LPMOs . We propose that the reaction with H 2O2first generates a highly reactive short -lived Cu(III)- intermediate which is subsequently transformed into the observed long- lived copper -dependent intermediate. The proposed mechanism offers new perspectives in the oxidative reaction mechanism of coppe r enzymes and hence for the biomass oxidation and the reactivity of copper in biological systems.

Although P450 enzymes generally catalyze a monooxygenation of wide variety of substances including hydrocarbons, steroid hormones and fatty acids, P450nor catalyzes reductive coupling of two nitric oxide (NO) molecules using NAD(P)H to produce nitrous oxide (N 2O) according to the following equation; 2NO + NADH + H+ N 2O + H 2O + NAD+.The mechanism of NO reduction by P450nor is proposed to consist of three processes. First NO molecule binds to resting ferric P450nor to form a NO - bound form. Subsequent hydride transfer from NADH produces reaction intermediate calle d intermediate I. Finally, second NO molecule attacks the protonated NO ligand in intermediate I to produce N 2O and ferric resting enzyme. To completely understand the reaction mechanism, it is necessary to elucidate the atomic structure and the electronic state of each intermediate . In this study, we applied recently developed time -resolved (TR) X -ray crystallography using X -ray free electron laser and TR spectroscopy to structural characterization of the reaction intermediates in the P450nor -catalyzed NO reduction. For the pump- prove experiments, we utilized a photosensitive caged - NO compound (BNN5a) which quantitatively releases NO within \u00b5s time domain upon UV illumination [1] as a trigger for the photo -induced reaction and a NO source for the P450nor -catalyzed reaction [2].TR visible absorption measurements showed that the UV illumination to the crystalline P450nor soaked with caged -NO and NADH could induce the formation of the NO -bound form at ~10 ms time domain and the formation of intermediate I at ~s time region. With use of this reaction system, w ecarried out TR serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) in which micro- crystals are continuously supplied to the XFEL irradiation spot, and solved the structure of the NO -bound form during the enzymatic reaction. The structure indicated the slig htly bent conformation of the FeNO unit in the NO -bound form [2]. Since t he formation of intermediate I in micro -crystals required ~5 s, we performed freeze -trap method to characterize this species. The structure of intermediate I which was determined by f ixed-target SFX showed tha tthe FeNO unit would be highly bent conformation. In order to get more information on the electronic structure of each intermediate, we measured TR infrared (IR) spectra of P450nor since the NO stretching frequency ( NO) is sensi tive to the structure of the FeNO unit. In the TR -IR spectra, formation of the NO at 1 330 cm-1with decay of NOat 1852 cm-1of the NO -bound form was observed, indicating that the band at 1 330 cm-1is assignable to the NO of intermediate I .This observation suggests that a Fe3+-NHO species is possible state for intermediate I . On the basis of current finding, we will discuss possible mechanism of NO reduction by P450nor. References [1]S. Namiki, T. Arai, K. Fujimori, J. Am. Chem .Soc. 119 (1997) 3840- 3841. [2]T. Tosha, T.

Eugene, OR 97403 USA. Reactive sulfur species, such as H 2S and sulfane -sulfur compounds, play key roles in different (patho)physiological processes.1Aligned with this importance, our lab has recently developed a palette of new fluorescent reporters and responsive donors motifs for H 2S and related reactive sulfur species. One key strategy in the development of these compounds focuses on the release carbonyl sulfide (COS), which is quickly converted to H 2S by the ubiquitous enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA). This design strategy enabled the first examples of analyte -replacement florescent probes for H 2S,2which we further leveraged to development of responsive COS/H 2S donors. In these systems, the donor is activated or triggered by specific stimuli, such as reactive oxygen species,3thiols,4pH changes,5enzymes,6etc.We have also developed both colorimetric4and fluorescent3COS/H 2S donor motifs, which enable real -time tracking of H 2S by fluorescence microscopy. This presentation will focus on recent sensor and donor constructs developed in our lab, cytoprotective eff ects of developed motifs, and new traceable donors that enable H 2S donation to be monitored directly.

Pgp, MDRs, ATPases) cells. The ATPase proteins ATP7A and ATP7B are among those held responsible for the efflux of platinum drugs outside cell and mediate resistance. It is known that both the proteins have more than 50% sequence identity and in response to cisplatin accumulation in cancer cells mobilizes from the golgi towards the membrane upon binding cisplatin to their thiol containing motifs CXXC. [1-2]There are reports which states that there is more accumulation of Pt drugs in cells overex pressing ATP7A or 7B but the toxicity is reduced due to vesicles formed upon the binding of the ATPases with Pt drugs . These vesicles isolate the drugs in compartments inside cells thus prohibiting them from acting on their main target DNA. Ru(II/III) comp lexes has emerged as excellent candidates against cisplatin resistant metastatic cancer cells as per in vitro and in vivo studies. The charge/radius ratio and the known interaction of Ru(II) with thiols suggests that Ru(II) may be equally or more susceptib le to binding by the CXXC motif of the ATPases . In the proposed presentation I would discuss our progress in this regard and also disseminate how the Ru coordination atmosphere and steric hindrance around the Ru(II) centre plays a role in inhibiting the tr ansport. Recently it was shown that Ru uptake by ATP based transporters may be affected by depletion of ATP and this may have dependence on the Ru(II) coordinated halide.[ 3] Here in we show that ATP7B is a potential transport protein that can deactivate an d transport Ru(II) anticancer agents or it can isolate them in vesicles depending on the type of complexes and stop them from acting against their targets in cell. The complexes with variation in steric hindrance and the coordinated halide 1 ,2and 3[4,5]when studied for transport by ATP 7B we found that the highest transport was for the most sterically hindered chloro coordinated 2 . In contrast, 1 and 3were quite resistant to efflux by ATP 7B. The results would be discussed in the presentation . Figure 1.

OP-80 Investigating the Dependence of Proinsulin C -Peptide on Metal Micronutrients Michael J. Stevenson1, Ian C. Farran1, S. Uyeda1, Jessica A. San Juan1,Marie C. Heffern1 1Department of Chemistry, University of California, Davis ,One Shields Ave nue,Davis ,CA, 95616 USA . C-peptide is a 31- residue bioactive peptide of growing interest for its potential therapeutic benefits. It is generated as part of proinsulin, the precursor to the hormone insulin, which regulates glucose levels in the bloodstrea m. In proinsulin, C -peptide connects the A -and B -chains of insulin and is cleaved in the secretory vesicles during the maturation of insulin. As such, it is released in equimolar amounts of insulin by the pancreas. While initially believed to be biologica lly inert, increasing studies suggest the potential for therapeutic applications of C -peptide in ameliorating illnesses such as kidney disease and diabetes. Further works reaffirm the beneficial role of C -peptide in diabetic patients, when coupled with metal ions such as Zn(II), Fe(II) and Cr(III), however the molecular mechanisms that govern these metal -dependent activities remain unclear. In addition, C -peptide has also been shown to internalize homogenously into cells and may interact with proteins locat ed in the cytoplasm. To this end, we sought to untangle the metal -mediated functions of C -peptide behind these interactions. Specifically, we used spectroscopic techniques to assess and understand binding properties between C -peptide and transition metal ions and the effect on the structure of C -peptide after binding. In addition to the metal -bound characterization of C - peptide, we determined the effects that metal ions have in either facilitating or inhibiting cellular internalization. Taken together, thes e results suggest that metal ions mediate structural changes and the internalization of C -peptide, thereby giving the peptide its biological activity.

Box 50329, 3603 Lemesos, the oxidation of cytochrome c to the reduction of molecular oxygen to water and links these electron transfers to proton translocation. The redox -driven CcO conserves part of the released free energy generating a proton motive force that leads to the synthesis of the main biological energy source ATP. Cytochrome ba 3oxidase is a B type oxidase from the extremely thermophilic eubacterium Thermus thermophilus with high O 2affinity, expressed under elevated temperatures and limited oxygen supply and possessing discrete structural, ligand binding, and electron transfer properties. The origin and the cause of the peculiar, as compared to other CcOs, thermodynamic and kinetic properties remain unknown. Fourier and time -resolved step-scan FTIR (TRS2-FTIR) spectroscopies have been employed to investigate the origin of the binding and electron transfer properties of cytochrome ba 3oxidase in both the fully reduced (FR) and mixed valence (MV) forms. Several independent and not easily separated factors leading to increased thermostability and high O 2affinity have been determined. These include (i) the increased hydrophobicity of the active center, (ii) the existence of a ligand input channel, (iii) the high a ffinity of Cu Bfor exogeno us ligands, (iv) the optimized (ET) pathways, (v) the eff ective proton -input channel and water -exit pathway as well the proton- loading/exit sites, (vi) the specically engineered protein structure, and (vii) the subtle thermodynamic and kinetic regulation. We correlate the unique ligand binding and electron transfer properties of cytochrome ba 3oxidase with the existence of an adaption mechanism which is necessary for efficient function. These results suggest that a cascade of structural f actors have been optimized by evolution, through protein architecture, to ensure the conversion of cytochrome ba 3oxidase into a high O 2affinity enzyme that functions effe ctively in its extreme native environment. The present results show that ba 3-cytochr ome c oxidase uses a unique structural pattern of energy conversion that has taken into account all the extre me environmental factors that aff ect the function of the enzyme and is assembled in such a way that its exclusive functions are secured. Based on t he available data of CcOs, we propose possible factors including the rigidity and nonpolar hydrophobic interactions that contribute to the behavior observed in cytochrome ba 3oxidase.

As an essential element that is toxic in excess, zinc homeostasis is a critical function for all organisms. Among bacteria, it is generally maintained by transcriptional regulation of zinc import and export proteins by zinc -responsive transcriptional regulators. Disruption of zinc homeostasis in bacterial pathogens can result in dramatic attenuation of virulence, making these systems attractive targets for the development of novel antibiotics. In particular, zinc importers of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) type are critical for the survival of many bacteria under zinc limited conditions. Bacterial ABC transporters rely on a periplasmic or lipoprotein solute binding protein (SBP) to bind zinc with high affinity and specificity and deliver it to the membrane permeas e for import into the cytoplasm. Recent data also indicates the participation of other extracellular zinc -binding proteins (e.g. metallochaperones) in metal import through ABC transporters in some species. We are studying zinc homeostasis in Paracoccus denitrificans , an organism with ABC operons znuABC and aztABCD . These are under transcriptional control of the zinc uptake regulator Zur [1], are highly upregulated during zinc deprivation, and are required for growth under these conditions [2]. Further, both operons are highly conserved in several human pathogens, including carbapenem a periplasmic transferring to the associated SBP (AztC) through a specific, associative mechanism that can be followed in vitro using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence [3] . Crystal structures of AztD and AztC [4] combined with kinetic data and mutational studies are beginning to reveal the function of AztD in zinc homeostasis and the molecular mechanism of zinc transfer. The observation that AztD is conserved in more than 500 genomes from diverse bacterial taxa suggests that this protein is an important component of zinc homeostasis and a newly identified family of zinc metallochaperones.

Receptor tyrosine kinases are a kind of important cell membrane receptor. The aberrant expression of receptor tyrosine kinases could result in a series of downstream signaling pathways and leading to cell proliferation regulation disorders. Receptor tyrosi ne kinases are overexpressed in many tumors, and the identification and detection of receptor tyrosine kinases have prominently research significance for early diagnosis, prevention and prognosis of tumors. Herein, a series of receptor tyrosine kinases sen sors were designed and synthesized, which were consisted of the fluorophore, linker and target moiety. The fluorescence signal is selectively and quickly generated by interaction with receptor tyrosine kinase s accumulating on the cell membranes of cancer cells. T he sensors are fluorescence quenching in the body fluids while the cell membrane of the tumor cells exhibit fluorescence due to conformational conversion of the fluorescent sensors. Moreover, t hey have good biological compatibility and permit the rapid, highly selective and sensitive identification of cancer cells via imaging of the tumor cell membranes. These sensors have high sensitivity and selectivity towards receptor tyrosine kinases on cell membran es and achieve in vivo and in vitro imaging, and they provide an effective means of early diagnosis of tumors .

The combination of nuclear spin polarization and high detection efficiency of -particles gives rise to a billion fold (109) or higher increase in sensitivity as compared to conventional NMR, and allows for interrogation of elements which are otherwise difficult to access. -NMR has been applied in nuclear and solid state physics for over six decades, and he re we present recent advances of the technique for bioinorganic and medicinal chemistry. -NMR has already been applied multiple times in measurements on Mg2+and Li+in ionic liquid solutions at TRIUMF, Canada's particle accelerator centre [1 -3].

For the last three years, we evaluated the molecular proceedings of hydrogen turnover with [FeFe] - hydrogenases making use of in situ ATR FTIR spectroscopy under gas and electrochemical control. [1] The active site cofactor is a structurally flexible iron -sulphur centre that comprises a [4Fe- 4S] cluster tethered to the eponymous diiron site. We found that the redox chemistry of [4Fe- 4S] cluster and diiron site is by individual transf er allows [FeFe] the \"rotated geometry\" of the oxidized H -cluster (Hox) throughout one -and two- electron reduction (Hred\u00b4 and Hhyd, respectively). Recently, we identified the amino acid residues involved i n catalytic PT from bulk water to the diiron site.[4] However, the dynamics of PT and hydrogen bonding (HB) remained elusive. Upon reduction of the diiron site, a proton binds in Fe -Fe bridging position and arrests the cofactor in a conformation that sign ificantly \"rotated geometry\". [5]This redox state, Hred, can be accumulated very efficiently. Reduction render the diiron site more alkaline, leads to the formation of a bridging hydride ( \u00b5H), and incudes changes in the HB network. I will present in situ ATR FTIR difference spectroscopy on the transition from Hox to Hred. For the first time, the infrared regime from 1750 -1550 cm-1was addressed to analyse the dynamics of HB changes in the catalytic PT pathway of [FeFe] -hydrogenases direc tly.

Molecular crowding agents are used to mimic the cellular environment. However, how the physicochemical properties ofco- solute ispoorly understood. We screened volum e fraction (%) and molecular weight (MW) of different crowding particles by bulk activity assays, smFRET and NMR diffusion experiments. In this way, we gain new insights on how polymer properties like dielectric constant, viscosity, diffusion ,and pore siz e influence the activity and folding of a large non- coding RNA, the group IIB intron ribozyme ai5 from S. cerevisiae [3,4]. Interestingly, smFRET experiments show that the most compact state, the putative active state of the ribozyme ,becomes more abundan twith increasing PEG concentration, although dense crowding becomes detrimental for activity. We found that the ribozymes activity is maximized when the pore size, i.e.the average distance of the crowding particles in solution, matches the hydrodynamic radius of the RNA [4].

Dysregulation of catecholamine neurotransmitters, and in particular their accumulation, plays a yet poorly understood role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, primarily Parkinson's disease but also Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia [1]. The toxic effects of catecholamines depend on their relatively easy oxidation to quinone species under oxidative stress conditions, which are typically promoted by endogenous redox active metal ions such as copper and iron [2- 4]. In the present study we report a comparative study of the oxidative reactivity of Cu-complexes with -amyloid (A 40) peptide fragment 76- 114 (PrP 76-114 ), containing the high -affinity binding site, towards dopamine and 4 -methylcatechol, in aqueous buffer and in SDS micelles, as model membrane environment. In particular, our ai m was to assess the efficiency in the oxidation of external substrates by the Cu -peptide complexes and evaluate the competitive oxidative and covalent modifications undergone by the peptides. The presence of SDS micelles has strong impact on the reactivity of the Cu -peptide complexes, because the peptides bear strong binding affinity to lipid membranes. The effect of SDS is to strongly reduce (A 40) and quench (PrP 76-114 ) the oxidative reactivity of Cu -peptide complexes. This behavior is due to the inclusio n of PrP peptide in the lipid phase, whereas for Cu -A complexes the binding site for both CuII and CuI is in the polar N-terminal portion of the peptide and remain essentially outside of the membrane (Scheme 1) . The reactivity of Cu -A complexes decreases in SDS because a significant fraction of the substrate may stick on the micelle surface hindering its binding to the Cu center in the aqueous phase. These results improve our understanding of physio - and pathol ogical effects associated with PrP as its strongly Cu binding and stress -protective properties can only be exerted when bound to membranes.

One promising strategy to approach this objective is to learn from the biological systems which carry out such chemistry.1Two nickel -and iron acetyl -coA synthase (ACS), are responsible for the reduction of CO 2to CO and the generation of acetyl -coA from CO, coenzyme A, and methylcobalamin, respectively.2 The work presented herein covers investigations of the reactivity of heterodinuclear [NiFe] and/or [CoFe] models towards CO 2and CO in terms of redox co operativity of metal centers, structural and electronic ligand effects, and mechanistic details. We outline the synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of such complexes, which have been designed based on several known mono -and dinuclear biomimetic catalysts.3-5The known relative affinities of NiI/NiIIfor CO 2vs. CO as well as the alkylating potential of CoII(N2S2)6are each exploited in tandem with a low -valent iron center in order to provide suitable conditions for CO 2reduction or C (methyl) -C(CO) bond formation, respectively. The reactivities of these heterobimetallic catalysts have been investigated using electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques as well as theoretical methods, and the results are analyzed and discussed in the context of their implications in developing comprehensive systems for CO 2valorization.

Machonkin1, Julia E. Burrows1, Madeleine C. Maker1 1Department of Chemistry, Whitman College , 345 Boyer Walla, WA , USA. The hydroquinone dioxygenases (HQDOs) members of a large family of non -heme Fe(II)- containing enzymes that catalyze the oxidative cleavage of an aromatic ring, of which the catechol extradiol dioxygenases are by far the best known and best studied. Like the catechol extradiol diox ygenases, the HQDOs are found in two unrelated structural classes, Type I and Type II, yet share the same 2 -His-1-Glu facial capping triad. The enzyme PcpA, from Sphingobium chlorophenolicum L-1, is a Type I HQDO and is structurally related to the major cl ass of extradiol catechol dioxygenases. We have shown that is ortho- disubstituted hydroquinones (but not catechols) with chloro - or bromo - (but not fluoro -) substituents greatly preferred at the ortho positions, and that ring cleavage occ urs between the OH and ortho substituent. [1] Several lines of evidence indicate that halogen polarizability is a major factor that determines the specificity of this enzyme. Substrate binding titrations show only a small shift in p Ka between the free vs. enzyme -bound substrate, suggesting that PcpA lacks an active site base needed to deprotonate the substrate , which is a key difference from the structurally Type II HQD O and displays a completely different pattern of substrate specificity, showing a preference for unsubstituted and monosubstituted hydroquinones, and a different ring cleavage regiospecificity. This points to important differences in the second coordination sphere that define how the hydroquinone substrate binds and is set up to be attacked by dioxygen.

Ferritins are a superfamily of proteins involved in iron storage and detoxification. They are widely distributed, examples being found in all domains of life[1]. The genome of the marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. CC9311 encodes three predicted ferritins. One of these, Syn Ftn, is unusual in that protein expression is upregulated in response to copper rather than iron[2]. We have recently shown that in addition to this unusual transcriptional respon se SynFtn contains structural features that distinguish it from all previously characterized ferritins. One consequence of these structural variations is a change in the mechanism of the iron -oxygen chemistry catalysed by the active site. The first intermediate formed in the reaction between iron and oxygen at the catalytic sites of other ferritins is a diferric- peroxo species[3], a feature that they share with the vast majority of di -iron oxygenases. The reaction centres of Syn Ftn also generate peroxide as the product of oxygen reduction but the first observable intermediate formed by the di-iron sites is a mixed valent FeII/FeIIIspecies. We have interrogated the iron -oxygen chemistry of SynFtn using a combination of magnetic -and optical -spectrokinetic s tudies, protein crystallography and site directed mutagenesis. Our data indicate that charge balance is achieved during this reaction via an unprecedented mechanism in which two centres separated by 24\u00c5both provide a single electron for the reduction o f a shared oxygen substrate bound at only one. The long range electron transfer implicit in the proposed mechanism is supported by the transient oxidation of aromatic amino acid sidechains[4]. Multiple sequence alignments of annotated ferritins in genome d atabases revealed > 100 homologues of SynFtn. These occur almost exclusively in the marine picocyanobacteria suggesting that Syn Ftn may represent the first characterised example of a subset ferritins distinct from the established system of classification c animal -, prokaryotic 579-586.

The trihydroxamate siderophore desferrioxamine B (DFOB) is biosynthesised by Streptomyces sp . to sequester growth essential environmental iron. The biosynthesis, sequestration and re- uptake rely on the enzyme/transporter cluster DesABCDEF, with parts of this cascade still under debate [ 1,2]. Using the S. pilosus system as a model, we semisynthetically modified DFOB by chemical diazo -transfer to yield azido click -chemistry -amenable analogue. We used to undertake strain azide -alkyne cyclo additio n to generate biotinylated DFOB as a chemical probe [3,4].In parallel, d iazo-transfer performed directly within the semi -purified of S . pilosus yielded further azide- functionalised metabolites that could have potential use as chemical probes. Precursor- directed biosynthesis in the culture medium of S. pilosus DFOB showed substrates were subject to N -acetylation but not N -hydroxylation, suggesting that DesC or a functionally equivalent N-acetyl transferase, but not DesB or DesD ,are capable of turning over \"blunt -end\" substrates in vitro [5]. Despite no further evidence of biosynthetic incorporation of t he exogenous substrates into monomeric or dimeric precursors or -analogues natively produced by S. pilosus , this approach opens up the opportunity to directly tag growth -essential secondary metabolites, such as siderophores, and investigat e biosynthetic processes in native systems of bacterial pathogens. This expedited and less invasive path facilitates biochemical interrogation by probing native metabolite sand circumvents other labour -intensive approaches to produce chemical probes. Deepening our understanding of bacterial biosynthesis may ultimately lead to identification of novel drug targets and therapeutics.

Stabilisation of G4 is induced by potassium or sodium ions that are located in the central ion channel. These DNA structures have gained interest due to their role in biological processes, such as chromosomal maintenance and regulati on of gene expression, and have been proposed as an attractive target for the development of anticancer drugs [1-2]. Thus, it is of interest to develop small molecules that are able to stabilise G -rich sequences; ideally, these should have both a high affi nity for G4 and a high selectivity over duplex DNA. To date, a number of compounds including organic molecules and metal complexes have shown to be good G4 binders, e.g. metal complexes with Schiff base -derived ligands. Almost all complexes stabilise these non-canonical structures through - interactions via end -stacking with the G4 tetrad. While excellent G4 binders have been developed using this approach, the G4 motif features a number of structural features that are not being explo ited to develop more selectiv e binders [3-4]. In particular, the interaction of small molecules with the central channel of the G4 tetrad is practically unexplored [5]. It was proposed that moving from a square planar system to an octahedral complex could achieve extra s tabilisation of G4 through the axial ligands interacting with the central ion channel. To strengthen this hypothesis, I designed and synthesised a series of novel octahedral cobalt(III) salphen complexes, [Co(salphen)L 2]Y, with different amine -based ligand s (L) in the axial positions. After investigating their stability in buffered media, the binding affinities of the complexes to different telomeric and oncogenic DNA sequences as well as duplex DNA were examined in vitro using a variety of different techni ques, including F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer displacement assay . Moreover, the affinities of the cobalt complexes to G4 in cell -mimi cking conditions were tested by investigating the unwinding activity of helicase, a protein that is able to unfold G4, in the presence and absence of the complexes. Lastly, cell experiments were performed to prove the uptake of cobalt complexes in differen t cancer cell lines as well as their cytotoxicity. In summary, we report the first known octahedral salphen complex expected to bind in a barely explored binding mode via the central ion channel of G4. High G4 binding affinity and selectivity, inhibition of helicase activity and templation of G4 formation at low concentrations are the key results. Successful cell experiments strengthen its application as potential candidate as anti -cancer drug.

The dual targeting was established by liposomal encapsulation of Pt(IV) complexes, thereb y utilizing the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect as the first stage of targeting to attain high accumulation of the drug- loaded liposomes in the tumor. After the release of the Pt(IV) prodrug inside cancer cells, a second stage of targeting directed a portion of the Pt(IV) prodrugs to the mitochondria. Upon intracellular reduction, these Pt(IV) prodrugs released two bioactive molecules, acting both on the mitochondrial and on the nuclear DNA. Our Pt(IV) system showed excellent activity in vitro and in vivo , characterized by enhanced mitochondrial damage and complete tumor remission, respectively. Notably, marked in vivo activity was accompanied by reduced kidney toxicity, highlighting the unique therapeutic potential of our novel dual - targe ting dual -action platform.

Nevertheless, the mechanism of metal trafficking at host/pathogens interface can provide a fertile ground for the design of new effective antibiotic therapies . To prevent infections , humans restrict the access to essential micronutrients by means of an innate immune response termed \"nutritional immunity\", on the contrary bacteria rely on sophisticated systems (e.g. metallo phore s) to overcome the scarce metal bioavailability. In the attempt to shed light on the host nutritional immune response (e.g. deepen the way of action of antimicrobial peptide s and other metal -sequestering proteins) and to develop novel highly specific antibiotics , it is crucial to investigate not only the host -mediated defence but also the pathogen ic metals acquisition processes [1]. Among several proteins involved in the mechanism of metals recruitment , we recently focused on ZinT, a 216- amino acid protein found in the cytoplasm of several bacterial species, which undergoes translocation to the periplasm in order to express its task of Zn(II) uptake under sever zinc- limited conditions , then shuttling the metal to ZnuABC transporter. The most probable metal -binding site of ZinT corresponds to three highly conserved histidine residues (His167, His176 histidine -rich loop (HGHHXH) , whose role is unclear, although it h as been suggested its participation in Zn(II) uptake [2-4]. The above results prompted us to deeply investigate thermodynamics and coordination chemistry of ZinT complexes with Zn(II) and Cu(II), two endogenic and competing metal ions. For this purpose, we studied t he protected peptide s Ac-166DHIIAPRKSSHFH178-Am and Ac - 166DHIIAPRKSAHFH178-Am, corresponding to the 166- 178 amino acid sequence of ZinT in Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica and typhimurium , respectively. The terminal AH129-Am) have been also considered, al ong with the His -rich fragment of YrpE metal -binding protein from Bacillus subtilis (Ac- 57HTHEHSHDHSHAH69-Am), which shows a remarkable similarity with ZinT . The characterization of the complexes has been achieved by means of mass spectrometry, potentiometry, UV -Vis spectrophotometry, circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).

Here we present data of coproheme from Listeria monocytogenes (LmChdC) and the three intermediate, in which the propionate at position 2 (p2) is converted to a vinyl group and is rotated by 90\u00b0 compared to the coproheme complex structure. The design of single, double and triple mutants of LmChdC [4,5], with impaired H -bonding interactions from the protein moiety selectively to propionates 2, 4, 6 and 7, allowed us to obtain the assignment of all the coproheme propionate bands by resonance Raman spectroscopy and to follow the H2O2-mediated conversion of coproheme heme b . Subs titution of H 2O2with chlorite allowed us to monitor Compound I formation in the inactive Y147H variant which lacks the catalytically essential Y147. This residue demonstrated to be oxidized during turnover, forming an essential tyrosyl radical, by using t he spin -trap 2 -methyl -2-nitrosopropane. Based on these findings we propose a reaction mechanism for the stepwise decarboxylation of coproheme that includes a 90\u00b0 rotation of the intermediate three - propionate redox cofactor.

While the chemistry of carboranes has been studied extensively since the 1960ies , recent development s focus mainly on design and principles for application . One aspect includes applications of metallacarboranes in biomedical chemistry.[1] Isosteric replacement strategies are applied linking the concepts of phenyl - or cyclopent or the fragment [ 3-M-1,2-C2B9H11]) in drug design. In that context, t he carborane cluster offers unique features, which are often recognised as superior to those of its organic counterparts (phenyl ring and cyclopentadienyl ligand), in view of a specific application, such as hydrophobicity, larger steric demand, special electronic structure, or site-specific derivatisation pattern. [2] Our group is specialised in metallacarborane chemistry with a special focus on half - and mixed - sandwich ruthena - and molybdacarboranes as pharmacophores for the design of antitumour agents . This approach allows a symbiosis of the carborane features, the versatility of metals in biological systems and specific ligands which can be selected according to their target s. We report here on the design, synthesis and biological eva luation of a hydroxytamoxifen derivative as a versatile ligand and vector system, which can be combined with a variety of transition metal complex fragments. Thus, incorporation of a molybda carborane modulates the biological activity towards breast cancer, glioma and glioblastoma cell lines compared to other successfully applied -active estrogen receptor modulators f MCF -7 cells revealed that the molybdacarborane derivative has an influence on the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the nitric oxide (NO) levels and autophagy processes. [4] Biological studies were performed with our new bovine serum albumin (BSA) -based nano - carrier system for metallacarboranes which was shown to significantly improve the cytotoxic activity of the studied half -sandwich molybdacarborane structures .[5] Financial s upport from the Fonds der Chemischen Industrie , the Graduate School Leipzig School of Natural Sciences - Building with Molecules and Nano -objects (BuildMoNa) and the Serbian Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development is gratefully acknowledged.

Recently , metal -mediated base pairing has become a convenient approach to functionalize nucleic acids site -specifically [1]. Parallel -stranded DNA which only rarely occurs in nature even expands the possible binding geometries for transition metal ions due to the transoid orientation of the glycosidic bonds [2]. Fluoresc ent nucleobase analog ues are of special interest as they could be used as sensitive metal ion sensors when the incorporated metal ion tailors the fluorescence intensity and absorption maxima [3]. In parallel -stranded DNA duplex es, 1,3-diaza- 2-oxophenoxazine ( X) forms stabilizing X-Ag(I)- X and X-Ag(I)- C base pairs as was confirmed by temperature -dependent UV spectroscopy and luminescence spectroscopy. The homo base pair X -Ag(I)- X stabilizes the examined duplex by 5.3 \u00b0C whereas the incorporation of silver ions into the hetero base pair leads to a thermal stabilisation of 7.9 \u00b0C (X:C) or 3.6 \u00b0C ( Upon silver(I)- the X:X or X:C base pairs, the luminescen ce emission maximum experiences a red -shift from 448 to 461 nm upon excitation 1,3 -diaza- 2-oxophenoxazine ligand is not quenched significantly upon binding a silver(I) ion. In fact, the luminescence intensity even increases upon formation of a C - Ag(I)- X base pair. As a consequence, the silver(I) -mediated phenoxazinone base pairs represent the first strongly fluorescent metal -mediated base pairs. In addition, theoretical calculations have been accomplished: DFT calculations of the silver(I)- mediated base pairs suggest the presence of a synergistic hydrogen bond. MD simulations of entire DNA duplexes nicely underline the geometrical flexibility of these base pairs, with the synergistic hydrogen bond facing eit her the major or the minor groove.

Nevertheless, cancer metastasis remains to be the leading cause of death amongst cancer patients and it is predicted that 13 million cancer -related deaths will occur annually by 2030 [1]. Treatment of MDA -MB-231 cells (a highly aggressive human breast cancer cell line in vitro ) with certain anti -cancer metal -complex es induce morphological and phenotypical changes in these cells, shifting them from a metastatic phenotype to a potentially less aggressive phenotype. Transdifferentiation of cancer cells from one cell type to another is reported to reduce malignancy and t umorigenicity [2]. The aim of our research was to characterise and quantify observed morphological changes in cells after treatment with the metal anti -cancer complexes , and to investigate the intracellular biochemical changes that are associated with and/ or contribute to such phenotypic changes. Cells were treated with sub -toxic concentrations of metal anticancer drugs , and after 72 hours digital holographic microscopy revealed remarkable changes in cell morphometric parameters including significant incre ases in cell area, optical volume, cell eccentricity and irregularity, as well as a decrease in cell motility and migration in treatment groups. Cell enlargement and surface flattening in treated cells was further confirmed with scanning electron microscop y. Scratch wound assay was also performed demonstrating that treatment with certain metal anti -cancer drugs inhibits wound healing and invasion despite having no effect on cell confluency. Further, capillary isoelectric focusing determined phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) protein, indicative of changes in cell signaling induced by such drugs. This study provides promising anti -cancer metallodrugs that have the potential to change the phenotype of aggressive metastatic cancer cells to a less invasive one. Development of such drugs targeting cancer metastasis will have profound clinical implications in the treatment of highly aggressive cancers.

Many different metal ions have been studied, but so far only Cd(II), Zn(II), and Cu(I) have been isolated in vivo , and only the lasttwo seem to have a biological relevance in the native organism [1].In 1986, Vasak and Good managed for the first time to obtain an Fe(II) -MT complex [2] but,in the following twenty years , only hints regarding the involv ement of MTs in iron metabolism were found [3,4]. Only in 2011 ,Hayashi et al. have been able to reco nstitute a stable tetranuclear Fe(II) -cysteine cluster in a MT .This cluster was proven to hav e electron -transfer ability, being able to promote the reduction of met-myoglobin [5]. With this work we want to present, to our knowledge for the first time , an iron -binding MT (mal_MT3) . This MT3 protein, found in apple (malus domestica ),is produced in Escherichia coli in its iron-metalated form and ,against any expectation , shows a strong preference to Fe(II) rather than Zn(II) in vivo. Furthermore, the intense red color of the protein sample (see Figure )and the profile of the absorption spectra suggest the formation of an [ 2Fe-2S]cluster, comparable to the one found in anamorsin [6].

It plays a metabolic role by reducing glucose le vels in plasma. However, the increased aggregation of hIAPP is connected with type II diabetes and may aggravate the disease [2] .

Experiments of mass spectrometry, potentiometry, NMR, UV-Vis and CD spectroscopy, determination of MIC and liposome leakage assay were performed.

Moco -dependent enzymes use of the metal to catalyze fundamental metabolic reactions. Moco is biosynthesized through a highly conserved 4 -step pathway starting from GTP, which is consecutivel y converted into cPMP, MPT and MPT -AMP prior to the insertion of the molybdenum (VI) deriving from molybdate [1]. This pathway involves a variety of different enzymes, whose expression seems to be controlled by an ncRNA regulatory element, the Moco riboswitch [2]. Riboswitches are involved in the control of gene expression and their activity is usually triggered by changes in the cellular concentration of a specific metabolite. This molecule binds to the RNA causing structural rearrangements and leading to a change in the gene expression by regulatory mechanisms that can occur both at the transcriptional or translational level. The Moco riboswitch presents classical characteristics common to this kind of systems, such as sequence conservation, nucleotide covariation and spare conserved nucleotides alternate to structured base -paired elements. Moreover, studies on the Moco riboswitch from E. coli, which is located upstream of genes involved in the Moco biosynthesis, proved its implication in their regulation [2].However, no evidence of direct interactions between the Moco riboswitch and Moco or any of its biosynthetic precursors have ever been observed. This is due to the scarce availability and high instability of these m olecules, which share a peculiar organic oxygen- sensitive scaffold that makes them unsynthesizable . However, protocols were established to isolate cPMP from bacteria and to obtain Moco inserted in a Moco carrier protein (MCP) from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [3,4]. Our goal is to determinate the identity of the metabolite that causes a conformational change in the Moco riboswitch testing the possible in vitro interaction between the Moco riboswitch and all available metabolites along the Moco biosynthetic pathway including cPMP and Moco in the form of Moco -MCP. For this purpose, we performed native gel electrophoresis and different footprinting assays under str ict oxygen -free conditions. We proved GTP, molybdate and cPMP are not specific Moco riboswitch binder . Moreover, both the apo -MCP and Moco loaded MCP from C.reinhardtii cause conformational changes inthe RNA structure. However, when the MCP is l oaded with Moco, the protein has a higher affinity to the RNA compared to the apo -MCP. Our findings suggest that Moco plays a role in the RNA - protein interaction enhancing the affinity between the two species. These results led to the hypothesis that Moco Carrier Proteins are not only involved in the Moco transfer but that they might have an active role in the RNA gene regulation.

[Pt(N 3)2(OH) 2(py) 2](Pt1)is the most potent amongst these complexes with higher cytotoxicity than cisplatin and active in cisplatin -resistant cell lines [1].Pt1can be derivatised at the axial hydroxyl species to introduce a second cytotoxic species or cancer targeting agent . Previously reported example sof such derivatisation have exploited reactions with succinic anhydride to generate a succinic acid derivative Pt2 that was then tethered to amino groups in peptides and small molecules in the presence of coupling reagents [2, 3]. However ,thesecoupling conditions are unsuitable for other targeting vectors such as proteins, whose conjugation require smild aqueous conditions.

In the field of medicinal inorganic chemistry, the most widely studied icosahedral metallacarboranes are those of type [ commo -3,3\u00b4-Co(1,2- C2B9H11)2]-, commonly known as COSAN species. COSAN -type complexes were in fact discovered in 2005 by C \u00edgler et al. to act as potent and selective HIV protease inhibitors, thanks to the properties of the carborane cluster per se .[1] The latter possess es great chemical stability under biological conditions, it is highly hydrophobic and has low systemic toxicity, which are properties that strongly motivate its use as scaffold in drug design, particularly for target -vector recognition approaches .[2] In our group, we focus our attention on metallacarborane complexes of type as pharmacophores for the design of antitumor agents, following a mechanism -based approach. Our first investigations revealed that the metallacarborane fragment spontaneously forms self -assemblies in aqueous solutions, in the nanometer range, whose size can be efficiently controlled upon formulation with bovine serum albumin (BSA), in a 10:1 molar ratio of BSA over metalla carborane.[3] These self - assembled nanoparticles might provide a selective drug delivery system , via exploitation of the well - known \"enhanced permeability and retention\" (EPR) effect. Here, we present our results on the design and in vitro biological evaluation of quinoline -conjugated ruthenacarborane complexes, against human glioblastoma cells (LN229). The drugs combine a ruthenacarborane fragment with known bioactive group s (quinoline d erivatives), already in use as scaffold for chemotherapeutic agents against glioblastomas, for its activity as autophagy inhibitor. The aqueous solution behavior of the complexes was investigated via UV -vis spectroscopy and Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA). Flow cytometric analysis on the LN229 cells revealed that one conjugate drug effectively acted as autophagy inhibitor, and as potent inhibitor of cell proliferation, and was therefore identified as promising drug candidate for further in vivo studie s.

Only a quarter of these 42 represent new compound classes with new modes of actions. Even worse, only one of these is active against Gram - negative pathogens, which are notoriously harder to eradicate.[1] Metal complexes have proven themselves very promising in the search for new cancer treatments, with multiple compounds in clinical trials.[2]Surprisingly , most of the attention seems to be on a ntitumour applications, while reports on me tal-based antibiotic compounds are rather sparse. Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) -based approaches where a photosensitizer is excited by light irradiation to generate reactive oxygen species has been shown to be an effective an tibacterial approach.[3]Recent stud ies found that bacteria are slow if not unable to develop resistance against the broad -spectrum effects of antimicrobi al PDT, further highlighting the potential of this strategy .[4]While some organic photosensitizers have been studied extensively for aPDT, only little is known about metal- based photosensitizer s agains tbacteria. We have prepared rhenium tricarbonyl -based photosensitizers that show both light -dependent and independent activity against several Gram -positive and Gram -negative pathogens. By comparing the activity of these complexes in different resistant and mutated strains as well as determining their bacterial cell uptake w e are able to make some conclusions about their mode of action which will aid in the preparation of targeted aPDT agents.

The biological synthesis of the H -cluster is an intensively studied process. Nevertheless, there is a still a lack of information concerning the stages of this process and HydF -HydA interaction on both quaternary structural and cofactor level. To a large extent this is due to difficulties in obtaining sufficient quantities of homogenous and active HydF. Recent studies ha ve shown that biomimetic model compounds can be introduced into HydF7,8. Critically, these semi- synthetic forms of HydF can mimic the reactivity of native HydF and transfer their synthetic cargo to apo -HydA, to generate fully active forms of HydA indisting uishable from the native hydrogenase enzyme. Here I will show how we can take advantage of this new found chemistry, which allows the preparation of significantly larger quantities of active HydF, and use it to elucidate the mechanism by which HydF activat es HydA.

The effective use of biomass is crucial in addressing the global need for sustainable energy sources. However, polysaccharides are highly recalcitrant to degradation, which poses a major challenge in their utilisation for the production of biofuel and commodity chemicals from renewable sources. A major breakthrough in the field was achieved by the discovery of lyti c polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs), copper -dependent enzymes found in a variety of organisms [1,2] .LPMOs break down polysaccharide chains via an oxidative mechanism in the presence of a reducing agent and molecular oxygen, thus boosting the action of classic enzymatic cocktails for industrial polysaccharide degradation. Understanding the mechanism of action of these enzymes and their interaction with the substrates is essential for the development of this field. Comprehensive structural, kinetic and s pectroscopic investigations of an oligosaccharide -active LPMO from the AA9 family have recently been reported [3,4] ,giving the first insight into the changes caused by the arrival of substrate to the Cu active site of the enzyme. 1H HYSCORE experiments in the presence of cellohexaose and chloride demonstrated the involvement of the N -terminus in a hydrogen bond network which 'connects' the copper active site to the oligosaccharide molecule [3].Electron upon binding of glucans and xylan [4]. We have now furthered these studies by analysing the interaction between the LPMO and its natural crystalline substrate through the development of a semi -oriented EPR spectroscopy method. Furthermore, we have expanded the analysis of the LPMO -substrate interaction using a chitin active enzyme belonging to the AA10 family. In this talk, we will highlight these collective data in LPMO chemistry and the implications for their effective utilisation in biomass degradation .

Nature has evolved a number of metalloenzymes that perform such hydrocarbons oxida tion, forming hydroxylated, halogenated and desaturated hydrocarbons.1It has been proposed that such reactions involve hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from an inert C -H bond to a high valent metal based oxidants such as M=O and M -OX (OX = OH, OR, O 2C-R, ONO 2).2-3However, the HAT reactivity of the metal -bound halide in C -H activation has not been studied before this work .4To get an idea about the HAT reactivity toward the hydrocarbon oxidation bymetal prepared by one -electron oxidation of the [NiII(X)(L)]-precursors (Scheme 1) and characterized using electronic absorption, EPR, XAS and mass spectrometry.4Oxidative reactivity through kinetics study of these complexes was investigated with a series of organic substrates containing phenolic O -H and hydrocarbon C -H bonds (Scheme 1). Analysis of the Hammett, Evans -Polanyi, Marcus plots ,KIE and oxidative produ ctstudy confirm that oxidation reactions were proceed through a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism. These are the first high valent nickel -halide oxidants that perform HAT reaction and hence open new routes for oxidative halogenation catalyst design without involvement of metal -oxo group .

Metalloproteins bind a single or multiple metal ions to perform their functions , either as different interacting cofactors or as multinuclear metal clusters. Some of the most diffi cult transformations are achieved by the subtle interplay of these metal units in many different ways such as magnetic coupling, charge transfer or sacrificial/protective roles [1]. Together with deep structural and spectroscopic studies of natural proteins, de novo protein design aims in disentangling the interactions between the protein matrix and the metal cofactors [2].By different approaches, we designed small ,yetfunctional ,models bearing multiple metal sites : (i) a carbo xylate bridged diiron site ,(ii) an abiotic tetranuclear zinc cluster, (iii) a cobalt porphyrin coupled to a ruthenium photosensitizer. We first show that by asymmetrization of the four-helix bundle scaffold , called DF -C1, and precise positioning of the re sidues at the binding site, we reached unprecedented selectivity in the oxidative coupling of aromatic dyes , performing a net 4 - electron reduction of dioxygen [3]. Then we show how very small changes of a similar scaffold may alter the number of bound metals and most importantly the geometry of a tetrazinc cluster in the 26 -mer peptide homotetramer, called QF [4].Finally, we describe our efforts to couple a photoactive polypyridyl ruthenium complex , active direct ligation to the peptide moiety .In perspective, our designed metalloproteins will be ultimately combined to get new catalysts of ever growing complexity.

Iron represents an appealing choice to develop new metal -based drugs ,being a cheap, bio -essential and relatively nontoxic element. Indeed several mononuclear iron complexes have been investigated for their anticancer behaviour and substituted ferrocenes have emerged as the most promising candidates [1]. On the other hand, a large number of di nuclear iron cyclopentadienyl complexes de riving from [Fe2Cp2(CO) 4]have been synthesized over the last 35 years [2] and yet their pharmacological properties remained unexplored. Bridging vinyliminium ligands can be installed on the diiron scaffold by stepwise assembly of isocyanide and alkyne units, thus giving access to a family of compounds with considerable structural diversity. These compounds are soluble in water and display good stability both in water and in cell culture medium. The combination of a net positive charge and non -polar fra gments endow such complexes with an amphiphilic character (Log P ow). Diiron vinyliminium complexes exhibit IC 50values in the low/medium micromolar range against ovarian cancer cell lines (A2780 and cisplatin -resistant A2780cisR) , together with towards -tumorigenic cells ( HEK -293).Ovarian cancer cell lines incubated with Fe 2 complexes show an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) , which could be associated to the cytotoxic activity. The diiron compound smay behave as pro -drugs, being activated by reduction to mononuclear Fe-cyclopentadienyl species and atomic iron, thus stimulating ROS formation .

The development of a PFE- EPR system enables the detection of paramagnetic species with direct and accurate potential control, providing new mechanistic insight into redox- based processes in biomolecules . Current EPR spectroelectrochemical setups are based on generating radical species in solution via electrolysis and/or require mediators1 and are therefore limited by diffusion . Accurate potential adjustment and concomitant investigation of paramagnetic intermediates, is thus not possible with large redox active complexes, including many proteins. We are develop ing a generally applicable PFE-EPR method to stu dy biomolecules irrespective of their size. Here, we prove the feasibility of a combined PFE -EPR method using small paramagnetic molecules and proteins, (16 that hierarchical indium tin oxide (ITO) structures2 are suitable working electrode materials, offering good conductivity and a large surface area for protein immobilisation. The mesoporous structure (meso -ITO) is compatible with commercially -available EPR instrumentation (Figure 1) and r emarkable sensitivity for EPR spectroelectrochemical applications was achieved with only 1 mm3 of electrode inside the EPR cavity. EPR spectr a of 4 -amino TEMPO and SOD not only indicate successful reduction and detection of the paramagnetic species but also demonstrate the direct, accurate and fast potential control offered by our PFE-EPR method .3 Further develop ments of the PFE-EPR method with greater surface area2 to investigate the mechanism of large metalloproteins such as respiratory complex I are also presented.

This was the first photoferrotroph ever isolated and during anaerobic growth it expresses a cytochrome c2and two HiPIPs Rpal_4085). Both HiPiPs c -type cytochromes are known to donate electr ons to the reaction centers of anoxyogenic photosynthesis, but the apparent redundancy of this pathway has yet to be fully clarified. In R. palustris , the cytochrome c 2, as previously seen for other purple bacteria, acts in cyclic electron flow to support photosynthetic growth. PioC is an HiPIP with specialized role in phototrophic iron oxidation. It delivers electrons directly to the light capturing reaction center, but it does not support cyclic electron flow and deletion mutants of PioC are still able to maintain residual reductive activity. Rpal_4085 has similar electrochemical properties to PioC and the two HIPIPs c oexist in the periplasm, but Rpal_4085 is unable to functionally replace PioC, appearing to be involved in divalent metal sensing [1]. In this work we used NMR spectroscopy to investigate the structural basis for the discrimination of the function of these small redox -active metalloproteins in the versatile anoxyogenic phototrophic pathways of R. palustris .These results not only illuminate th e molecular aspects underpinning this ancient metabolism ,but also guide the development of biotechnological applications of this versatile micro organism [2] Rengasamy R, Fike DA, JM, Bose A, Commun, 2019, 10, 1365.YR-27 A Novel Ni -containing B 12 Derivative -Elucidating of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 19 0, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland. For a better understanding of biological processes catalyzed by transition metal complexes with porphinoid ligands, it is important to discern why different structural alterations of one ligand system were chosen by nature in order to accommodate a specific metal center. Some important porphinoid cofactors that display a high structural complexity are the B 12cofactors methylcobalamin (MeCbl) and 5' - deoxyadenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), cofactor F430. While the two former cofactor s, derived from vitamin B 12, play important roles in the metabolism of methionine and folate, nucleotide synthesis[1] and the breakdown of odd fatty acids,[2]the latter (\"F430\") is found only in methanogenic bacteria where it catalyzes the formation - as well as the oxidation - of methane.[3]Recently we accomplished the first partial chemical synthesis of a cobalamin derivative starting from vitamin B 12,that contain sa central nickel ion instead of cobalt. K ey step of the synthetic route wasthesimultaneous demetallation and ring closure of a ring-opened 5,6-secocobalamin. The resulting 'nibalamin' derivative shares spectroscopic features with F430 that are attributed to structural similarities of the tetradentate ligand framework.[4] The coordination chemistry of this hybrid F430- B12species, however, support spioneering work of the Eschenmoser group regarding why nature has combined Ni with a corphin rather than a corrin ligand in F430 to allow for challenging biochemical transformations.[5]Semi -synthetic metallocorrins can shed new light on the old question of corrin vs. corphin ligand in nature but might as well bear potential for applications in analytical and medicinal science.

The electronic structure of these clusters is integral to their function and re activity, and as such studying these systems necessitates a detailed understanding of the underlying electronic states. Nearly all known biological mixed -valent [Fe 2S2]+clusters exist in the localized S= 1/2 ground state, arising from strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the locally high spin Fe(III) S= 5/2 and Fe(II) S = dimers exhibiting a S= 9/2 for the Cys60Se rmutant ferredoxin of C. pasteurianum .[1] 2(\u00b5-OH) 3]2+S = 9/2 synthetic complex is known, with a diiron distance much shorter than typical [Fe 2S2]+clusters .[2-3]Inall cases where S = 9/2 ground states have been observed, the iron ions remain anti-ferromagnetically coupled in a classic exchange coupling mechanism, J < 0, and a Heisenberg double -exchange (sometimes referred to as resonance delocalization), B , is invoked to explain the fully delocalized ground state. [3-4]The interplay of these two mechanisms allows for the stabilization of an antiferromagnetically coupled S= 9/2 ground state when | B/J| is sufficiently large , but more interestingly predicts the possibility of stabilizing intermediate -spin ground states S = 3/2, 5/2, or 7/2 for certain balanced | B/J| ratios. The recent isolation of novel [Fe 2S2]+,[Fe 2SSe]+, [Fe 2Se2]+complexes with bulky bidentate ligands have yield ednew and intriguing electronic properties not observed in other diiron biomimetic complexes .These complexes are the first known examples of intermediate spin -states (1/2 <S< 9/2) in diiron dichalcogenide of the M\u00f6ssbauer, EPR, and ENDOR spectroscop ic data of these complexes complimented with magnetic susceptibility measurements clearly establish the atypical electronic structure observed. These s ynthetic complexes provide insight into the mechanism of electronic delocalization in biological clusters , a fundamental concept for the understanding of electronic structure and reactivity of larger, more complex FeS clusters.

J. Chemistry, College London, UK . 2Centre of Excellence in Neurotechnology, Imperial College London, UK . 3Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London, UK . Background : Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, affecting ~30 million people worldwide. One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease is the aggregation of amyloid beta (A ) to form fibrils, a process that is promoted by the binding of Fe2+,Zn2+and Cu2+ions to its N-terminal (amino acids 1-16). To date, a variety of metal complexes , including platinum phenanthroline derivatives and cobalt Schiff base complexes, have been developed to bind to the N -terminal of A to prevent A aggregation ; however, whilst many of these complexes have shown promise in vitro , they are ineffect ive in vivo due to an inability to cross the blood -brain barrier (BBB).1,2As of now, the only method to disrupt the BBB in a non- invasive, targeted and reversible manner is with focused ultrasound and microbubbles.3 In this work, we have synthesised a series of metal salens, salphens and salnaphs as potential inhibitors of Aaggregation, investigated their binding mode to A and show that they can be delivered across the BBB in vivo using focused ultrasound. Methods :Metal complexes were synthesised and assessed for their ability to inhibit A aggregation using the Thioflavin -T assay. using fluorescence and 1HNMR spectroscopy. Metal complexes were delivered to the left hippocampus of mice using focused ultrasound, with the right hippocampus used as the non -sonicated control .Brain sections were analysed using laser ablation inductively -coupled plasma mass or stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to detect the presence of the complex within the brain and assess safety respectively. Results: All metal complexes tested show an ability to inhibit A aggregation, with greater inhibitory activity observed for complexes with vacant coordination sites. 1H NMR and fluorescence experiments suggest that these complexes interact with A via -stacking interactions with aromatic residues such as Tyr-10 and coordination with histidine residues (His -6, His -13 or His -14). Using focused ultrasound and microbubbl es, metal complexes were successfully delivered across the BBB to the left hippocampus of mice .No signs of tissue damage were observed in H&E -stained brain sections.

Nanomaterials assembled using complementary oligonucleotides are costly, and it is challenging to attach oligonucleotides at well -defined sites and uniform coverage densities. Defects in nanoparticle size and shape further increase the polydispersity of these assemblies. However, protein cages, such as ferritin, provide atomically precise, nanoscale building blocks that are monodisperse and allow for specific attachment of different linkers. Ferritins provide stable protein cages, amenable to many modifications via site-directed mutagenesis and synthetic chemistry. We previously demonstrated and others have shown encapsulation of supercharged protein cargo within AfFtn[3,4] . Here, we introduce a Zn2+-binding site to the small, 3 -fold symmetric channels of AfFtn, which can be further modified with bishydroxamate linkers to prepare arrays of cargo- templated protein capsules with tunable distances and geometries.

The development of selective and efficient catalysts for oxidation of various organic substrates has become an importa nt task in pharmaceutics and chemical industry . A great challenge of the fine organic synthesi s is the selective epoxidation of C=C and hydroxylation of strong aliphatic CH bonds. Furthermore , it is very important to use environmentally friendly and nonexpensive reagents. Natural metalloenzymes catalyze the oxidation of multifunctional organic substrates with very high regio - and stereoselectivity under mild conditions inspiring researchers to design biomimetic catalysts (synthetic models of nonheme iron oxygenases). The systems based on iron complexes with tetradentate N-donor ligand and H 2O2 as an oxidant were found to be one of the best biomimetic catalyst systems for alkenes epoxidation and alkanes hydroxylation [1]. Nowadays f or all preparatively useful catalyst systems FeII,FeIII/H2O2/RCOOH, the FeV=O species have been proposed to be active oxidizing inter mediates. However, to date, o nly a few examples of selective hydroxylation of aromatic substrates are known. In 2010, Rybak- Akimova and coworkers obtained convincing indirect evidence in favor of the participation of oxoiron(V) species in aromatic hydroxylation [2]. So far no direct studies have been carri ed out on th e reactivity of nonheme oxoiron(V) towards arenes. Herein, we report bipyrrolidine (complex 2)). It has been shown that the electronic structure of the detected oxoiron(V) intermediates depends on the structure of the added carboxylic acid RCOOH. So, catalyst systems with the additive of branched carboxylic acids 1/H2O2(CH 3CO 3H)/(for example, 2 EPR spectra of two unstable FeV=O intermediates, 1 1 and 12 (Figure 1a ), systems 1/H2O2(CH 3CO 3H)/(linear carboxylic EPR spectrum of one unstable FeV=O intermediate 1a. In the case of systems with 2 -ethylhexanoic acid additive the presence of an equilibrium between two tautomeric species has been proposed (Figure 1b ). It was found that the direct reactivity of the oxoiron(V) intermediates 1a and 2a nitrobenzene <acetophenone <chlorobenzene <benzene <toluene, in accordance with the growth of the electron -rich properties of the substrate, which is consistent with the mechanism of electrophilic substitution in the aromatic ring. The iron complex 2 catalyzes aromatic hydroxylation by H 2O2 or peracetic acid in acetonitrile, performing up to 36.5 catalytic turnovers per Fe atom. Also, high selectivity toward aromatic oxidation products (up to 91%) has been documented.

The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from water splitting is a substantial process to generate a precious alternative to fossil fuels . However, the high overpotential is its main constraint. Different approaches have been developed to overcome this limitation [1]. Accordingly, the development of innovative bio -inspired systems to catalyze the HER is considered a promising solution [2].Previously, wehave rationally designed porphyrin- peptide conjugates, named \"Mimochromes \", a family of peptides mimicking natural heme proteins, with diverse catalytic activities [3]. The i ron(III) derivative of mimochrome VI*a (Fe(III)MC6*a), the most active analogue, has shown a peroxidase activity that approaches natural peroxidases [4]. Cobalt(III) derivative (Co (III)MC6*a) has shown promising catalytic -activity, longevity and stability for electrochemical HER under mild conditions [5]. Nevertheless, the high overpotential (~ 680 mV) hampered its potential application .A stable, effective and stand- alone photo- sensitizing system may represent a viable solution to bias such thermodynamic requirement. On this respect, some criteria should be taken into account in the choice of (i) the photosensitizing moiety (e.g. solubility, quantum yield, reduction potential), (ii) the conjugation method (e.g. orthogonality, modularity, scalability), and (iii) the optimal distance between the active centers. Herein, we are introducing the design and synthesis of our first prototype of Ru (II)-based photosensit ized Co (III)MC6*a system . First, a new rut henium -based photosensitizer has been designed and synthesized to achieve the chemical stability and photo- activity requirements . Spectroscopic and theoretical characterizations of the photoactive comple x support the followed approach. Next, a derivatizable moiety allows the (III)MC6*a.

P002 Construction and C haracterization of 752 73 Uppsala Sweden Inventing novel approaches to creating sustainable energy is an important cause in a world where the atmosphere temperature is rising, conflicts over fossil fuels are ongoing and options are sparse or inaccessible. The aim with this project is to develop biological cataly sts that can sustainably and efficiently produce solar fuels such as hydrogen gas or methane through the oxidation of water or reduction of carbon dioxide. Using transition metals for this type of redox -chemistry has been an attractive target for some time , and it is our hope that applying it to a biological scaffold will help overcome problems such as oxygen -sensitivity, solubility and stability, as well as being able to use cheaper, first row transition metals.1 The 3x-protein designed by Tommos et al. i s currently the scaffold being used for this project, and several metal -binding sites have been planned.2 Current work is ongoing to create binding sites containing four histidines, four cysteines and a mixture of the two using site directed mutagenesis ( right part of figure for an example with two cysteines and two histidines). This scaffold will bind several of the interesting redox -active transition metals (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu). With this approach we can, with spectroscopic techniques, screen for what met al-protein complex will most readily form, and also perform redox chemistry most efficiently. The redox potentials and catalytic properties and mechanisms will be studied with protein film voltammetry and transient absorption laser spectroscopy. We aim to find a scaffold/metal system, which is active for both reducing and oxidizing chemistry, depending on, among other things, the substrate and the metal ion. It is our aim that this project lead to novel and applicable catalysts for solar fuel production, bu t also that they will act as a stepping stone for other solar -driven catalysis using pure proteins. This project will hopefully contribute to the bioinorganic chemistry -community as a whole with new insights on metal -protein interactions and the chemi stry that can be achieved w ith this type of complexes. We also aim to incorporate non -water soluble molecular catalysts such as cobaloxime to the 3x scaffold (left part of figure), which would provide a non -polar environment, replacing non- polar solvents. This way the molecular catalyst could be indirectly solvated in water, by being surrounded by a non -polar protein core. One of the problems with molecular catalysts for e.g. hydrogen evolution is that they are often not water soluble, and so their usability in industrial settings is limited as it is an important goal for the energy sector to reduce not only their CO 2 emissions, but also their environmental impact in general. Water is more environmentally friendly and abundant than many of the organic solve nts that are used for molecular catalysts, and so being able to show a proof of concept of using proteins instead of organic solvents for these types of molecules would be a great development in the field of energy research.

For the last decades the development of susta inable chemistry became a priority for our society. In this field, catalysis plays an important role into chemical processes but, still remains challenging for oxidation reactions using renewable oxygen atom sources. In our laboratory Ru -Ru dyads were developed enabling photocatalytic oxidation of organic substrates using H 2O as oxygen atom sources respectively [1]. Here, we focus on another challenge related to the introduction of chirality in order to perf orm asymmetric photocatalysis. Biocatalysis is an interesting strategy due to enzymes abilities to perform various reactions in high yield, high selectivity and high efficiency. In this context, a new way of research combining metal -based catalysts and protein scaffold affording artificial metalloe nzymes is emerging [2]. This approach is very attractive due to system modularity (protein mutation, various inorganics complexes and substrates). In this project, we aim to develop bio- hybrid photocatalysts combining photosensitizers and catalysts into a well-characterized protein crystal. The selected protein is oligomerisation domain of the LEAFY protein from Ginkgo biloba. It was observed that such a protein is able to generate porou s structures by self-assembling [3]. Inside the tubes, a peptidic chai n of about 30 amino -acids, per monomer, can be found and will served as grafting platform for both Ru- based catalysts and photosensitizer for asymmetric photocatalytic oxidation of organic substrates. It is expected that such an environment would afford hi gh selectivity (chimio and stereo) i n addition to a high stability. Our strategy is based first on the study (selectivity, quantification) of each partner separately inside the crystal to determine the optimized conditions. Then, the full system will be ge nerated and studied before evaluation of its photocatalytic activity C.; 11222. 374 375 ICBIC-19 ICBIC-19 Poster Presentations Artificial PhotosystemsPoster Presentations Artificial Photosystems Book of Abstracts Book of AbstractsP005 Solar -Driven Enzymatic Carbon Dioxide F University Oeiras, Portugal Since industrialisation the CO 2concentration in the atmosphere has increased continuously. The elevated CO 2level leads to the acid ification of the sea and contributes significantly to global warming. Thus, it is desirable to minimise the release of carbon dioxide and utilise the atmospheric CO 2chemically by building base chemicals and fuel. Some enzymes, including Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) and Formate dehydrogenase (FDH), are capable of fixing CO 2despite its highly inert character under mild conditions and use the products of the reduction for their metabolism. Inspired by these natural systems, there are already first st udies published in the area of CO 2reduction by ribosomally expressed and purified enzymes attached to dye -sensitised semiconducting nanoparticles [1,2]. In these systems it has been shown that the solar -driven reduction of CO 2to formate and carbon monoxi de respectively as well as the accumulation of the reduction product is possible. The necessary reduction equivalents are delivered by sacrificial electron donors via a photocatalytic systems. In this work the focus is on the transformation of CO 2to meth anol, an important base chemical, by a cascade of enzymes consisting of FDH, Aldehyde dehydrogenase and Alcohol dehydrogenase. The chosen biohybrid approach is particularly elegant, since solar power is used to convert the climatically and environmentally malign atmospheric CO 2into an energy -dense fuel via solar power.

In a world where energy consumption raises more and more, the need of a renewable energy source as well as a possibility to store this energy is crucial1,2. An already existing, inexhaustible energy source is the sun. Besides harvesting sunlight, the energy must be stored in a suitable material. In this context, artificial photosynthesis is one of the most promising approaches for both, harvesting and storage of solar energy. A complete water splitting system would contain a hy drogen evolving catalyst (HEC), an oxygen evolving catalyst (OEC) and a photosensitizer (PS) where electrons from the oxidative half reaction are transferred efficiently to the reductive half reaction where protons get reduced to hydrogen. To study the activity or mechanistic aspects of a HEC, the oxidative half reaction is replaced by a sacrificial electron donor (SED) to rapidly deliver electrons to the PS ground state3. For water reduction, Co(II) -polypyridyl HEC's emerged as quite promising, stable and well performing systems in aqueous media. Cobalt as catalytic centre is a very suitable first row element due to its ability of supporting multiple oxidation states and coordination geometries4. The ligand systems themselves are crucial in catalysis. To assess the role of the ligand systems fore catalytic performance of HEC's, our group synthesized a series of catalysts with different functionalities on the CH2 -bridge. We will present a benchmarking of photocatalysis and differences in electrochemical behaviour for catalysts shown in the scheme5. These derivatisation of the bridging group of the ligand system allowed us to understand the mechanistic role of these functional groups attached to the bridge.

Homogeneous photocatalytic water reduction is investigated by our group with polypyridyl -based cobalt containing water reduction catalysts (WRC) and rhenium -or ruthenium -based photosensitisers (PS).[1] As for a whole water splitting system the oxidation and reduction have to be separated , different approaches to immobilise water reduction catalysts andphotosensitiser sare currently followed. One approach is the preparation of a photocathode consisting of polymerised PS and polymerised WRC on a conductive support. We present here the progress with one W RC monomer. A thiophene was added t o the basic structure of selected and highly active polypyridyl ligands. With this thiophene ,a polymerisable unit was introduced to the ligand that can form a conductive polymer. After complexation to cobalt, the monomeric WRC1was obtained. Polymerisation of thiophene and its derivatives with Fe(III) in presence of di fferent doping anions has been described .[2] This method was successfully applied to 1and resulted in a water soluble ,catalytic ally active polymer.

Burning fossil fuels has potentially contributed significantly towards man made climate change - reverting or at least limiting its effects is among the biggest challenges of the 21th century. The development of renewable energy sources appears to be a key requirement in order to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Solar light driven water splitting, a process inspired by nature's photosynthesis, promises to be a valuable source of renewable energy. While there has b een considerable success in developing catalysts to facilitate this process, so far there is no commercial viable setup available. In order to further improve existing catalysts, as well as to design novel catalysts, an in -depth understanding of the underl ying reaction network is necessary. Since the complexity of bio- mimetic catalysts is often found to be overwhelming due to their sheer size, simpler model systems such as mononuclear Ru -based catalysts have been developed. The latter offer the opportunity for a detailed study of their physicochemical properties as well as for targeted design. Recently we proposed a viable reaction mechanism for a bio -inspired mononuclear Ru- based water oxidation catalyst. A key feature of the latter is the non -coordinating covalently linked pyridine which was found to be in an optimal position to facilitate the oxygen -oxygen bond formation by interacting with the approaching nucleophile. Our theoretical study further showed that by tuning the basicity of the pyridine the ba rrier for the O -O bond formation could be significantly lowered. Moreover, ligand design was carried out in silico for the development of more active catalysts. In the current study, we use forefront ab initio molecular dynamics simulations for a sophisti cated inclusion of solvent effects. In order to get an accurate picture of the free energy surface, we apply enhanced sampling methods such as Bluemoon and Metadynamics - those allow us to characterize the reactive species under ambient conditions. Thereby we are not limited to the active site of the catalyst, but we are able to get a complete picture including the dynamics of the hydrogen bonding network. As a part of this study we also evaluated the applicability of well known protocols based on the Bluem oon ensemble to predict the pK a value of the ligand of said transition metal based water oxidation catalyst.

The ongoing research on photocatalytic water splitting can be roughly subdivided into molecular catalysis, mostly complexes inspired by natural photo -and redox active systems ,[1,2]and surface catalysed approaches. Although molecular catalysts outperform any surface in terms of turnover frequency and electrochemical tunability of the catalytic centre, they bear some crucial disadvantages compared to surface catalysed systems, especi ally regarding long- term stability and applicability in a full water splitting system. The lack of separation of the two half -reactions in a homogeneous system leads to electron short -cuts, which quench the catalytic cycle. Separation would lead to control of the direction of electron flow, as it is the case in a PEC cell. To integrate the high catalytic rate of molecular catalysts in a two -cell system , a new, active and stable cobalt -polypyridyl water reduction catalyst (WRC) ,with phosphonic acid anchoring groups was synthesized and covalently bound to TiO 2,as this substrate is often used as passivation layer with a large bandgap in PEC cells. As cobalt -pyrphin complexes have already been shown to be both, fast and stable in homogeneous syst ems,[3]the anchor ing-groups were introduced at the bridging- position of the cyclic ligand framework. The molecular footprint of the WRC on TiO 2nanoparticles as well as pH dependent binding stability was determined. Photocatalytic H 2-evolution measurements were performed as well as kinetic studies of the electron transfer from the photosensitizer to the WRC, both with the focus on the comparison between in-solution and on-particle systems . Finally, the WRC was adsorbed a TiO 2-coated FTO -cathode and subjected to electrocatalysis at different pH values. Simultaneous VIS -absorption measurements of the working electrode served to detect the reduced Co(I) -WRC at the specific reduction potential and in -line CG measurements allowed to find the effective overpotential for H 2-production.

A popular implementation of smFRET consists in recording fluorescence intensity time traces of s urface -or vesicle immobilized, chromophore -tagged molecules, such as proteins [ 1]. We developed MASH -FRET, a MATLAB -based Multifunctional Analysis Software for Handling smFRET data that allows to analyze and simulate camera -based single -molecule videos (SMV) [ 2-6]. In brief, our software extracts fluorescence trajectories from SMVs, allows sorting the molecules according to their dynamics and photophysics and analyzes the resulting FRET or fluorescence intensity state populations both ther modynamically and kinetically [2,4]. To validate experimental distributions of FRET states and their interconversion rates, MASH -FRET additionally allows the user to simulate realistic SMV [ 3]. The software is freely available for download on GitHub at https://github.com/RNA - FRETools/MASH -FRET and documented with the help of step -by-step tutorials that are available at https://rna -fretools.github.io/MASH -FRET/. Here, we provide a presentation of our software package with a standard analyzing strategy for SMV. We further explain the basic concepts of smFRET and how to get the most out of your intensity- based smFRET data in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics.

Some metal complexes have been found to ex ert their anti-cancer activity by targeting proteins directly and inhibiting cancer physiological conditions, and it has been reported to exist high cytotoxicity towards a wide range of cancer cell lines including cisplatin -resistant cancer cells and display promising in vivo tumor growth inhibition in multiple animal tumor models. Identification of target engagement of anti -cancer metal complexes has always been a difficult task. Previously, a clickable photo -affinity probe of gold -1a was used to identify heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) as one of the molecular targets of gold(III) porphyrins and the inhibition of gold -1aon the chaperone activity of Hsp60 was observed [1]. However, there could be additional molecular targets escaping detection with chemical probes, as structure modifications may affect the activity spectra of original compounds. Owning to the advancements in multiple omics technologies and bioinformatics resources, methodologies have been developed to predict drug targets and reveal the mechanisms of action in silico . Understanding the regulatory behaviour of both transcri ptome and proteome of cells response to drug treatment is necessary, which information can provide useful insight sinto the mechanisms of action. In this work, a joint analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data was perfo rmed to produce unbiased perspectives on the mRNA and protein expression stat us of colorectal cancer cells with gold-1a treatment. The genome -wide transcriptome profiling in combination with bioinformatics analysis including Library of Integrated Network B ased Cellular Signatures (LINCS) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) gold-1aas an aminop eptidase inhibitor. The transcriptional and proteomic responses of cancer cells to gold -1awere found to be similar to those of tosedostat (CHR -2797); the latter has been proven effective against a wide range of cancers in clinical trials and could inhibit intracellular aminopeptidases. Aminopeptidase splay significant roles in cancer progression. Thus, targeting aminopeptidase is a viable s trategy in the development of new anti -cancer agents. Gold -1ainhibits the activity of intracellular aminopeptidases and subsequently induces a series of downstream amino acid deprivation response, such as up -regulating the expression of amino acid synthet icand transporter genes, modulating mTOR signalling pathway, disrupt ing protein turnover and inducing autophagy. In addition, computational calculation reveals the spatial construction of protein -small molecule complex, in which gold-1afills the enzyme a ctive site of aminopeptidase N. Our findings demonstrate that gold(III) porphyrin is a potent scaffold for the development of novel aminopeptidase inhibitors. References [1]D. Hu, Y. Liu, Y. T. Lai, K. C. Tong, Y. M. Fung, C. N.

However, the independent academic committee of chemical biology division was organized and valued research projects in 2017. Bioinorganic chemistry is one important part in the division. Looking back the developments of chemical biology in China, the funding supporting from Major Research P lan (MRP) of NSFC has occupied important role. The first MRP entitled \"Investigations on Signal Transduction Process Utilizing Small Chemical Probes \"was initiated in 2007 [2]. Projects of four specific themes have been encouraged: 1) Generation of chemical probes for studying signal transduction; 2) Development of new techniques and methods for detecting the information of signaling processes; 3) Sign aling mechanisms of cellular functions based on chemical small molecules; 4) Biomarker, target and lead discovery based on signal transduction processes. 189 Million Chinese Yuan with 155 research projects related to chemical biology have been supported un til the MRP was completed in December 31, 2015. Funded project investigators came from chemical science, life science and health science (Fig 1, a). And the most of the project participants with interdisciplinary background. Subsequently, the second MRP entitled \" Dynamic Modifications of Biomacromolecules and Chemical Intervention \" was approved and initiated in 2017. Three main specific research fields were encouraged: 1) C hemical labeling and detection technology of d ynamic modifications of biomacromolecu les; 2) Regulation mechanism and function analysis of d ynamic modifications of biomacromolecules ; 3) Chemical intervention and application of d ynamic modifications of biomacromolecules .90Chinese Yuan Million with 89 research projects have been funded fro m 2017- 2018 (Fig 1, b). Most of the projects cover the research theme 1 and 2. And theme 3 would be enhanced to attract more scientists with different background.

Subsequently, the coated PDA molecules could be degraded in acidic endosome/lysosome, leading to the release of DOX. Additionally, by taking advantage of the excellent photothermal p roperty of HMCuS NPs, HMCuS NPs could accelerate the release of DOX and enhance therapeutic efficacy upon near-infrared (NIR) irradiation. HMCuS NP@PDA hybrids could effectively kill cancer cells in vitro and in vivo with minimal side effect, which provide s a promising strategy for cancer theranostics.

These systems must be biocompatible, cause no immunogenic reactions, and promote controllably release ofdrugs atthetarget sites without altering its therapeutic effects. Among the major problems pointed out for the application of nanoparticles in medicine are their easy aggregation in solution and toxicity to the organism . However , these problems can be bypassed with a functionalization step using biocompatible linker molecules or polymer chains [1-2].Ourresearch group has synthesized and functionalized mesoporous silica particles (M PSi) with functionalized nanoparticles (MPSi -NH 2),with a spherical shape and uniform size distribution between 80 and 110 nm ,were successfully obtained . MPSi -NH 2was a nincorporation of 320 per gram of nanoparticle ,originating MPSi -NP.A of using MPSi NO releas ingwere conducted , which show edvery efficient ability to release NO .Once the major drawback in the clinical use of nitroprusside still resides on the amount of cyanide released simultaneously with NO[4], this work aimed to investigate the ability of the nanoparticles to minimize cyanide toxicity . We performed th ese measurements investigating the potential of retention of cyanide o n the MPSi-NH 2right after NO release either induced by chemical (ascorbic acid) or photochemical (blue LED at 450- 495 nm) processes. Additionally, other experiments were performed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the M PSi-NPaccording to standardized method using Vero cells ( mammalian kidney epithelial cells).The results showed that NO was efficiently released from MPSi -NPby using ascorbic acid and blue LED , wherethe amount of free CN-in solution was only ca.31.9% and 6.6 %, respectively , in comparison to 100% of CN-release by SNP .The relatively larger release of cyanide for ascorbic acid induced, we suggest it might be due to a competition between cyanide and ascorbate ions for the positively charged surface of the material (zeta potential value of 20 \u00b1 0.5 mV) .The assays with kidney cells indicated amuch lowercytotoxicity for , while for MP Si-NPitcould not be obtained even at the highest concentration used ( 1000 \u00b5M ).

The interest in this kind of compounds applied as host of active molecules, given a bioconjugated material, is due to the need for prolonged and improved control of drug administration, as well as the potentialization of metallopharmaceuticals. Therefore , the aim of this research was the preparation of new modified -POSS materials based on silsesquioxane to carry potential antitumor metal complexes. Targeting biological applications, on the POSS were immobilized two oxindolimine copper(II) complexes forming some new materials. Morphological and structural characterizations were accomplished. Electron paramagnetic ressonace (EPR) showed that both copper(II) complexes were linked to matrices modified, and it was evidenced on X -band a signal at forbidden trans ition, (M S\u00b12) exactly at the half -field of the g -factor (G) at different temperature, which may be owing to interaction between two copper(II) nuclei with ferromagnetic behavior. This possible interaction between two copper and dimeric minority formation may be the reason for the increase in cytotoxicity. This initial idea is in agreement with one of the papers published in our group in Brazil, where binuclear complexes showed higher/better results compared to mononuclear systems[2]. The anticancer activ ity of the new compounds was then tested toward SKMEL -147 melanoma cell lines, in comparison to non -tumor fibroblasts. The results displayed high toxicity of these materials after both copper(II) complexes be immobilized on the POSS surface towards SKMEL -147, and show lower cytotoxicity against fibroblasts. In contrast, the pure POSS and complexes were non -toxic against the same melanoma cell lines proving the high performance of the bioconjugated systems. Cytotoxicity assays on SKMEL -147 human melanoma cel ls revealed that bioconjugated materials are at least two to five times more active against melanoma cells compared to non -tumor cell line (Fibroblast P4).

Tetrapyrrole macrocycles play a central role in mos t of the present living organism s. The importance of them stem from the unique attributes of tetrapyrroles for diverse bioenergetic processes (including photosynthesis) and have been further encouraged by the versatility, concision and molecular logic of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway. All naturally occurring corrinoid, porphyrin and (bacterio)chlorin macrocycles known as the p igments of life, investigated so far are biosynthetically derived from the common precursor, uroporphyrinogen III. Porphyrins have been utilized for high -valent transformation utilizing O 2, while other saturated porphyrins (porphyrinoids) are assigned for low -valent transformations like NO 2-, SO 32-reduction etc. Fe- Porphyrin s have been synthesized and the redox potentials have been tuned by introducing electron withdrawing groups (EWGs) to the -pyrroles1.Two EWG can afford facile O 2reduction while four EWG increases the over -potential -indicates the obvious choice of heme a in cytochrome c oxidase. It has been selectively saturated utilizing 1,3 -cycloaddition reaction.

These coordination motives allow for their fascinating reactivities and selectivities that inspire chemists to develop appropriate model compounds. The biomimetic approach has mostly considered the primary coordination sphere only, whereas cavity based metal complexes have been shown to mimic the active site pocket as well [2]. Examples of molecular cages that offer a well -defined ligand sphere to mimic non- heme enzymatic active sites via imidazole coordination are yet unprecedented. Here, the endohedrally functionalized cage ligand 1, derived by DCC, acts as a tridentate ligand for a single copper ion.

Carotenoids carry out a variety of critical functions in all forms of life. In plants they operate as accessory light -harvesting components (antenna complex) of photosynthetic systems, light induced antioxidants, membrane fluidity regulators, and pigments (yellow to red -orange; important in attracting pollinators). In animals, carotenoids yield essential precursors necessary for vision, embryonic development, cellular homeostasis, and immunity (Vitamin A). Since vitamin A is not synthesized de novo in animals, it is necessary to consume pre- formed vitamin A (retinyl esters) from other sources or as provitamin A compounds found in vegetables and fruits. Carotenoid Cleavage Dioxygenases (CCDs) are enzymes capable of producing carotenoid derivatives (apocarotenoids). They are found in all forms of life. They generally catalyze the cleavage of carotenoid carbon -carbon double bonds. CCDs possess a nonheme group in their active sites. The ferrous ion is coordinated to 4 histidine nitrogens in a \"see -saw\" geometry. In this wor k, we will probe the structure -spectroscopic relationship for the CCD active sites using small molecule model compounds. We have synthesized a series iron(II) compounds coordinated to 4 histidine mimics (imidazole) in various geometries. The complexes hav e been characterized by X -ray crystallography, M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy, electrochemistry, and DFT.

Its radical properties make it a highly reactive species able to damage all macromolecules contributing to the pathogenesis of many diseases including neurodegenerative disorders.[1]In order to protect cells against O 2\u00b0-,Nature uses dismutases (SODs) which catalyze the dismutation of O 2\u00b0-into hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. The last discovered SOD contains a nickel cofactor (Figure 1) .[2,3]Importantly the NiSOD is found in several pathogenic bacteria but not in humans. Therefore targeting the NiSOD is a promising approach to develop antibiotics. Secondly, the development of novel SOD mimics may have potential uses as therapeutic agents in oxi dative stress -related diseases. Our project aims at developing innovative active NiSOD mimics, based on the use of peptide like ligands (see Figure) ,[4]with two main objectives: (i) to develop efficient SOD like catalysts, active in water, displaying anti oxidant properties and (ii) to contribute to the full understanding of the catalytic mechanism of the NiSOD to highlight the specific key elements that differ NiSOD from the human MnSOD. Two NiSOD mimics based on sulphur -rich pseudo -peptide ligand , derived from nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) with the three acid functions grafted with cysteines ( L3S), have been investigated. In the presence of NiIIand L3Sin a 1:1 ratio, two Ni complexes are formed with a similar S3O coordination sphere, which have be en fully characterized by a combination of spectroscopic techniques including 1H NMR, UV- vis, CD and XAS, together with theoretical calculations. Three thiolates originating from the cysteines of the L3Sligand bind the NiIIion. T he square planar geometry is completed by either a water molecule, [NiL3S(OH 2)]-, at physiological pH (pH range 5- 8),or a hydroxo molecule, [Ni L3S(OH)]2-,in more basic conditions (pH>8).

In duplexes composed of these DNA strands, metal -mediated base pairs can be formed upon metal ion treatment. In contrast to canonical base pairs, the hydrogen bonds between complementary nucleobases are formally replaced by coordinate bonds to one or more transition metal ions [1].Since these metal ions are located inside the double helix, a modification of the charge transfer properties of this DNA is anticipated . In this work, the charge transfer resistance (R CT) of DNA films containing artificial homo and hetero base pairs of7D6PP has been investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to study if charge transfer through DNA can occur. In prior studies, DNA films including artificial Im:Im base pairs have been investigated ,which show edan increase in charge transfer resistance upon Ag(I) treatment (Im=imidazole) [2] .This behavio ur was not according to expectations since the presence of Hg(II) - mediated T:T base pairs (T = thymine) leads to a decreasing charge transfer resistance for the corresponding DNA film [3].It was assumed that the Im:Im mismatches within the DNA destabilize the duplex structure ,result ingin a higher flexibility and bulged loops, thus leading to a thinner DNA film on the gold surface. It was speculated thatthis effect has a bigger impact on the charge transfer resistance than the formation of the metal -mediated base pairs. To prove this assumption, DNA films with metal -mediated homo and hetero base pairs of 7D6PP have been studied towards their R CTchange upon metal ion treatment. This artificial base was chosen since melting studies of 7D6PP-containing DNA revealed a relatively high thermal stability in the absence of Ag(I). This behavio ur can be explained by an expanded -surface, leading to more rigid dup lexes even in absence of metal ions. Therefore, the 7D6PP was a promising candidate for charge transfer resistance studies on gold surfaces. The results of these studies will be presented here.

Bacterial NO Reductase (NorBC) is a membrane -bound enzyme found in denitrifying bacteria that is involved in catalyzing the two -electron reduction of NO to N 2O and water. The mechanism under which NorBC operates is highly debated, due to the fact that the protein is difficult to work with. There are three proposed mechanistic pathways, involving the unique diiron heme b 3/non-heme Fe Bactive In the the heme b 3is ligated by a proximal His, and the non -heme Fe center is coordinated by three His residues and a Glu. Also, an oxo bridge connects the two metal centers, making the Fe -Fe distance only 3.5 \u00c5. Synthetic model systems provide the opportunity to give insight into the m echanism of action of this enzyme. We have developed a synthetic model system of NorBC, consisting of a tetraphenylporphyrin -derivative clicked to a modified BMPA -Pr ligand, as shown in the f igure. This complex has been characterized by NMR and Uv -Vis spec troscopy. Armed with this synthetic model, we are now investigating the systems interaction with NO, and examine some of the different factors that influence the reaction mechanism . 396 397 ICBIC-19 ICBIC-19 Poster Presentations Bioinspired and Biomimetic SystemsPoster Presentations Bioinspired and Biomimetic Systems Book of Abstracts Book of AbstractsP049 Nickel Complex in Trigonal Bipyramidal Geometry Supported by T ripodal a Amidate Ligand Chemically McDonald1.

High valent transition metal ions are natural mediators of oxidative reactions i n biological systems.[1] The petrochemical industry relies heavily on homogeneous catalysts to convert hydrocarbon feedstock to high valuable oxidised products .[2]Little emphasis has been placed on high valent metal oxidants based on late transition metal s, namely c obalt, nickel and c opper.[3]The high oxidation and reduction potentials of Ni ions necessitates the modulation the ligand system, to make the high oxidation states more accessible.

[3] Due to the high dismutation rate of hydrogen peroxide and the superoxide radical promoted by compound 1 , the interaction of this compound with H 2O2was investigated by RPE and ESI -(+)-MS and the interaction with superoxide radical was investigated by RPE (the superoxide radical was produced employing KO 2in DMSO). Suppression of the characteristic signal of the superoxide radical immediately after interaction with compound 1 reinforces the high dismu tation activity verified in the kinetic studies. Thus compound 1presents potential for future pharmacological studies due to the significant dismutation activity against hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical. References [1]T. Ribeiro et al.

P055 Tuning the P eripheral Electronic and Basic P roperties of Co -Bis-(Oxime-Imine) Complexes Gujarat 382355 , India . Energy efficient and economically viable H 2production is crucial for successful utilization of renewable energy resources [1]. In nature, the hydrogenase enzyme provides the gold -standard for efficient H 2evolution catalyst [2]. Several synthetic catalysts were developed by mimicking the enzyme active site over the past few years but most of them failed to attain the enzymatic efficiency [3,4]. The poor activity of these synthetic mimics indicates that the active site -surrounding protein scaffold should be considered during the design of synthetic catalyst. Shaw et al. have included amino acids as bio - inspired outer coordination sphere (OCS) ingredient around nickel -bis-phosphine core to improve its reactivity [5, 6]. In this work we have, we have chosen Co -diimine -dioxime complex as a core and modified it by including two important features. First, a redox -active ligand was incorporated and secondly, natural a mino acid -based basic groups were decorated in the periphery using pyridine as an axial ligand. A series of four complexes were developed following this strategy and examined electrochemically in aqueous solution displaying variable H 2production activity. The peripheral basic groups provided additional protonation site as well as stability to the complex to work across the broad pH ranges (pH 1 -7) while the redox active ligand scaffold reduced the overpotential requirement. Thus this work highlights the im portance of inclusion of enzyme -inspired features in artificial catalysts design for tuning their reactivity. References [1]M. Patrick, D.

This process being of interest for human societies (biomass conversion), it is of importance to be able to reproduce such reactivity with catalysts that are simpler and cheaper to produce than full -length proteins.[3]In that regard, several groups have focused their effort into developing very short peptides that assemble into fib res and can perform catalysis (with or without metal). Recent reviews showcase the potential of this approach.[4,5] Here, we present a very na\u00efve design inspired by LPMOs.

Therefore, we based our design on two de novo peptides, that were designed and described as forming fibres only when mixed together.[6]Each peptide was modified to bear one part of the ligands, in order to form the full histidine brace coordination sphere upon hetero assembly. This poster presents the characterization and results obtained with these peptides upon copper binding.

Copper complexes in biological systems act as electron transport agents and as oxygen carriers , processes that exploit the CuII/Ieasy redox processes. As such, copper ions can act as both antioxidant and pro-oxidant species. R adicals occur naturally in the human body and can damage cell walls, interact with genetic material, and contribute to the development of a number of health problems. Alkyl radicals are usually formed in biological systems via the reaction between hydroxyl radical s and organic molecule s.Methyl radicals a re the simplest alkyl radicals an d are therefore used in mechanistic studies. This study focuses on the interaction of ATP with both Cu(II) and Cu(I) ions and the redox activity of the latter formed complexes in general, and their reactions with methyl radicals. The methyl radicals were produced in vitro by continuous radiolysis of N 2O saturated aqueous solutions containing DMSO. Cu(I)ATP reacts with CH 3in a process which involves the formation of a transient with a metal -carbon bond ATPCu(II)- CH 3which decomposes heterolyticall yto give products. Its di -valent a nalogue forms ATPCu(III)- CH 3, which decomposes heterolyticall yto give methanol andCu(I)ATP. Rate constants for these reactions have been determined.

The mechanistic study of hydrogen production by iron thiolate catalyst is reported. Complex [TBA][(,2-bdt)( -PPh 2)Fe 2(CO) 5]wasprotonated to the formation of Fe -hydride species first and Fe - hydride -S-protonated species eventually in the presence of acids .The title complex exhibited catalytic e v e n t s a t 1 . 1 6 a n d 1 . 5 7 V ( v s F c+/Fc) in the presence of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and trifluoroacetic acid, respectively. The f ormer and latter catalytic events were originated from th e Fe - hydride and Fe -hydride -S-protonated intermediate species, respectively. When anilinium acid was used, the catalysis occurred at 1.16 V, identical with the working potential of the trifluoromethanesulfonic acid catalysis, although the employment of an ilinium acid was only capable of achieving the Fe -hydride state on the basis of the spectral and calculated results. The thermodynamics and kinetics of individual steps of the catalysis were analyzed by density functional theory calculations and electroanalytical simulations. The results suggest that the involvement of anilinium acid most likely initiated a proton - coupled electron transfer pathway that avoided the disfavored intermediate after the initial protonation. Via the proton -coupled electron transfer pathway, the heterogeneous electron transfer rate was increased and the overpotential was decreased by 0.4 V in comparison with the stepwise pathways involving trifluoromethanesulfonic acid or trifluoroacetic acid. It is found that the Fe -hydride -S-proto nated species reacted with decamethylferrocene to produce hydrogen ,the Fe -hydride species ,and decamethylferrocen ium cation as the final product s. The yield of hydrogen production reached 75%. Compared to the reduction potential of decamethylferrocene at 0.59 V, hydrogen evolution from the reduction of the Fe -hydride -S-protonated species by decamethylferrocene was thermodynamically unfavored. According to the results of the computational investigations, it is suggested that decamethylferrocene molecul es stayed in the near proximity of the sulfur proton with the presence of possible hydrogen bonding. It facilitated proton coupled electron transfer for the formation of hydrogen. When Fe 2analogs with bulky substituents were employed in the catalysis, the hydrogen evolution was proceeded at a slower rate and a lower yield was observed, suggesting the steric hindrance retarded the catalytic reaction.

Heyrovsk\u00fd Institute of Physical Chemistry, The Czech Academy of Sciences, Czech Republic. 2Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, The Czech Academy of Sciences, Czech Republic. Our investigation addresses the selectivity displayed by bioinspired iron -oxo oxidants performing C -H bond activation. Upon H -atom abstraction (HAA), the nascent C -centered radical and iron -hydroxo complex may follow different pathways: (a) dissociation of the products, (b) rebound hydroxylation or (c) desaturation. Although studied for over 40 years, the physicochemical factors gover ning the outcome of these reactions is still not fully understood and up to this day cannot be predicted. By applying density functional theory to a set of eight experimentally well -characterized systems showcasing HAA followed by either rebound or dissoc iation, we studied this post- HAA reactivity in the search for clues on this conundrum. First, we applied the standard computational approach: characterize all minima and saddle points in the relevant spin surfaces for each process, sketching a general energetic overview. To distill the most out of this endeavor, we applied a methodology \"Reactive Mode Composition Analysis\", providing the Kinetic Energy Distribution [1] in the transition state mode. With this, we built a coherent picture showing that, beside s the energetic considerations, there is a dynamic component embodied in the reactive mode that has been neglected so far in the study of rebound and dissociation. Our ongoing work is projected to broaden the understanding of C -H activation reactivity, pro vide a simple tool to diagnose rebound vs dissociation reactivity and inspire the analysis of reactive modes in general reaction mechanisms.

Mononuclear non -heme iron enzymes that contain the 2 -His-1-Carboxylate facial triad ( 2H1C ) are able to activate molecular oxygen to catalyse a broad and diverse range of oxidative transformations, rivalling those mediated by their heme counterparts [1]. However, non -heme enzymatic active sites are generally more difficult to study as they do not bear the strong spectral features typical of the heme porphyrin ligand. Therefore, developing synthetic structural models of non- heme iron enzymes through biomimetic inorganic chemistry is an attractive means with which to gain further spectroscopic and mechanistic understanding of non -heme iron enzymes. In this work, a novel phenolate ligand ( DiPhImNNOtBu) is demonstrated as being one of the mos t faithful structural mimics of the 2H1C to date. The ligand comprises two biorelevant imidazole groups and a phenolate moiety that together form an anionic N,N,O facial triad, mimicking the two histidine residues and the carboxylate group of 2H1C [4]. Complexation of 1 ). The ligand's N,N,O facial triad occupies three of the coordination sites, and the fourth is occupied by a substitutionally labile chloride ion. The substitution of the chloride anion in Complex 1 is a highly attractive means with which to model the coordination of exogenous ligands (e.g. cofactors or substrate molecules) to the enzymatic res ting state. Indeed, it is these exogenous ligands that enhance the dioxygen binding affinity of the enzyme active site, from which all oxidation catalysis is derived from. In this study, the substitutional lability of the chloride ligand is explored with benzoylformate ligands. In this way, Complex 1 is established as a highly convenient and versatile synthon from which a range of different biom imetic complexes can be created, whose spectroscopic properties accurately model the active sites of their metalloenzyme counterparts. The subsequent oxidative transformations of these complexes upon exposure to dioxygen are also under investigation. References [1]L. (2004) 939- 986. [3]P.C.A.

The superoxide anion radical is considered to be a reactive oxygen species (ROS). [1] Although it naturally occurs in the body, an imbalance of superoxide is linked to aging processes, cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. [1-2] The enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) should balance steady -state concentration in living organisms by catalyzing superoxide decomposition to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. Hydrogen peroxide in general can damage biomolecules. [1, 3 ] Hence, the presence of peroxide cleaving like glutathione peroxidase (GPx) utilizing glutathione (GSH) as reductant is crucial for maintaining healthy ROS levels in the body .[4] The organoselenenium compound ebselen has gained large interest, not merely due to its GPx mimicking abilities, but furthermore, since it is widely applicable as biological antioxidant in the treatment of neurodegeneration, bipolar disease, diabetes, cancer and due to its antibacterial, antimycotic and antiviral effects. [5] Among the (MnPAMs) was observed to have remarkable SOD activity and beneficial biological effects .[6] The combination of two or more active agents covalently bonded is long known as the concept of hybridization and represents a sophisticated approach aiming at several targets. [7] To eliminate oxidative stress and its accompanying damage, we designed a hybrid molecule of Mn(II)pyane -CH 2NH 2 and ebselen (see figure) to target both superoxide, with the former, and hydrogen peroxide, with the latter, potentially resulting in water and oxygen as products, i.e. complete ROS removal .

Hydrogenases, enzymes that activate molecular H 2, exclusively utilize Ni and Fe in [NiFe] -, [FeFe] -, and [Fe] -hydrogeanses.1However, other transition metals are known to activate or catalyze the production of hydrogen in synthetic systems.2Here, we report the development of a biom imetic model complex of [Fe] -hydrogenase that incorporates a Mn, as opposed to a Fe, metal center. This Mn complex is able to heterolytically cleave H 2as well as catalyze hydrogenation reactions. Incorporation of the model into an apoenzyme of [Fe] -hydrog enase results in a [Mn] -hydrogenase with enhanced normalized activity over an analogous semi -synthetic [Fe] -hydrogenase. These findings represent the first instance of a non -native metal hydrogenase showing catalytic functionality and demonstrate that hydrogenases based on a manganese active site are viable.

The chemical shift of the proton in the HNO moiety showed an unusual behaviour as a function of temp erature, and was consistent with an equilibrium between the Fe(OEP)(HNO) complex and a hydrogen bonded Fe(OEP)(NO)-complex. Low temperatures favored the hydrogen bonded complex. In addition to 1H NMR, 2H NMR -dichlor ophenol , and similar results were observed. Stopped flow visible spectroscopy was also used in order to verify that the complex remained in the {FeN8oxidation state after addition of the weak acid. Stopped flow and variable temperature visible spectroscopy showed that the Fe(OEP)(HNO) and the Fe(OEP)(NO)-hydrogen bonded complex have similar visible spectra, which were significantly different from Fe( OEP)(NO)-in the absence of hydrogen bonding. These results emphasize the importance of verifying that the HNO complex remains protonated as the temperature is lowered for spectroscopic techniques that need to be carried out at low temperatures.

Mimics of superoxide dismutases, which catalyse the decomposition of O 2to H 2O2and O 2, have traditionally used redox -active metals, which are toxic outside of a tightly coordinating ligand. Purely organic antioxidants have also been investigated but generally require stoichiometric, rather than catalytic, doses. Here, we show that a complex of the redox -inactive metal zinc(ii) with assays and stopped -flow kinetics studies of direct reactions with O 2and the zinc(ii) complex. The observed superoxide dismutase catalysis has an important advantage over previously reported work in that it is hastened, rather than impeded, by the presence of phosphate, the concentration of which is high under physiological conditions.

We will present our methodology [1] recently developed for the analysis of various contributions to C-H bond activation reactivity including the contribution from asynchronicity between H+/e-transfers, which stems from the disparity between redox and acidobasic thermodynamic forces. To demonstrate the power of the approach, we will show and discuss H -atom abstraction reactivity of several biomimetic complex es and organic radicals. In the second part of the presentation, we will also correlate asynchronicity with a so -called 'reactive mode composition factor' and we will discuss the importance of this factor for rebound vs. dissociation selectivity of several experimentally well -characterized ferryl complexes.

The active site of GO is converted to CuI-phenol in the course of the alcohol oxidation, but the CuI-phenol can be oxidized by O 2to reproduce the CuII-phenoxyl radical. In order to understand the detailed properties and reactivities of GO , many metal(II)- phenoxyl radical complexes have been reported,[2]while the formation of the CuII-phenoxyl radical from CuI-phenol with O 2is still rare.[2,3]In this connectio n, some studies have been reported, showing that CuII-phenolate complexes activated O 2in the catalytic reaction as models of GO.[2,4]However, the detail mechanisms for alcohol oxidation with CuII-phenolate complexes and itsredox behavior have not been clarified. On the other hand, in the catalytic cycle of copper amine oxidase ( CAO) , CuI-phenoxyl radical described as a valence tautomer of the CuII-phenolate has been proposed as the one of the important intermediate sin the pathways for formation of the CuII-quinone species by O2.[5]However, direct observation of formation of the stable phenoxyl radical from the CuII-phenolate complex with O 2is yet to be reported. In these points in mind, we have investigated formati on of CuII-phenoxyl radical complex with and of Cu(ClO 4)26H 2O with H 2(Me 2NL) (right figure) in the presence of two equivalents of triethylamine in 1:1 mixture of CH 2Cl2/MeOH under inert gave CuII-diphenolate complex [Cu(Me 2NL)(H 2O)] (1 ) as crystals. Reaction of complex 1 with O 2caused color change to purple, and the UV -vis absorption spectral change revealed that the 515- nm band derived from N,N- dimethylamino phenoxyl radical gradually increased. The resulting species showed EPR silent at 77 K, while the copper ion was still +II state from the results of Cu -K-edge XANES. Therefore, the reaction product of complex 1 with O 2assigned to the CuII- dimethylaminophenoxyl radical species, which could be isolated to [Cu(Me 2NL)(MeOH)]ClO 4(2) as crystals. X -ray crystal structures of complexes 1 and 2are similar geometry, while the detail structural features of 2 are different from those of complex 1 exhibiting dimethylaminophenoxyl radical structural characteristics in complex 2 . The EPR and UV-vis absorption spectra of CH 2Cl2solution of complex 1 clearly exhibited temperature -dependent equilibrium between CuII-diphenolate and CuI-N,N- dimethylaminophenoxyl radical. From these results, formation of the CuII-phenoxyl radical complex 2 was formed by the reaction of complex 1 with O 2via the CuI-phenoxyl radical intermediate. References [1]J. W.

Catecholamine dysregulation is implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, psychosis and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). S elective recognition and detection of catecholamines is exceedingly challenging due to their small size, non -specific molecular shape and trivial chemical properties. We report here the development of a bioinspired, copper -based oxidative bond cleavage for the catecholamine -triggered release of a fluorescent reporter for selective and sensitive catecholamine fluorescent detection. Live cell imaging with the new probe successfully visualized the accumulation and depletion of dopamine in cellular models of neuron differentiation and Parkinson's disease. Complemented by morphological studies in the same experiment, catecholamine imaging using the new probe provides for the first time an integrative approach for studying important neuronal processes.

It plays a role in the metabolism of higher organisms [1]. For nickel(II), the terminal amino group and side chain imidazole -N, thiolate -S and carboxylate- Oof proteins serve as main binding sites in the metalloproteins. In our previous research we have synthesized and studied the zinc(II), cadmium(II) and lead(II) complexes of a series of peptides containing two cysteine residues [2, 3]. One group of the liga nds have a free N -terminal amino group and an am ide group on the C- termini: Ser (CSSACS -NH 2), while the other group of consists of terminally prote cted peptides: Ac (Ac-CSSACS -NH 2). We have continued this work with the investigation of nickel(II) complexes of aforementioned peptides and completed them with the terminally protected tetrapeptides containing cysteine on the N - 2). The stoichiometry and stability constants of the metal complexes were determined by potentiometry, while their structures were supported by means of CD -, UV -Vis, MS -and NMR -spectroscopy. In the case of three peptides containing free terminal amino group, the N -terminal part of the molecules is the primary binding site and (NH 2, S-), (NH 2, N-, S-) or (NH 2, N-, N-, S-) donor sets coordinate the metal ion, but the coordination of C terminal cysteine -S-contributes to the formation of stable complexes. At high pH-range, however, the C terminal thiolate group is able to behave as an anchor group, and coordination isomers are present in equimolar solution, while dinuclear species were detected at excess of nickel(II) ion. In the case of the terminally protected t etra-and hexapeptides, the C -terminal thiolate and the amide groups are the primary binding sites. For tetrapeptides containing cysteine on the N -termini the thiolate group is the p rimary binding site only, when there are no side chain donor groups with s trong coordination ability in the peptide (Ac-CGAA -NH 2, Ac-CGAK -NH histidine in the Ac -CGAH -NH 2peptide however, takes over the role of primary binding site, and the (N-,N-,N-, N Im) coordinated nickel(II) complexes are formed.

FNORs are found in certain pathogenic bacteria, equipping them with resistance to nitrosative stress, generated as a part of the immune defen se in humans.

B for direct, redox -state specific, intracellular asco rbate detection are therefore indispensable for understanding ascorbate -related processes in cells. However, c onventional approach such as HPLC, electrochemical method sand optical assays for ascorbate analyses are far from satisfactory.

Among all transformations, metal -catalyzed carbene transfer reaction from diazocompounds to inert C -H bonds is a promising methodology due to its grater atom economy when compared with the most extended cross -coupling procedures. [1] Until now, copper and rhodium complexes have been found to be the most efficient metals to perform this transformation. However, the iron -catalyzed carbene transfer reactions have been less explored and they are limited to less demanding processes. [2] In this work we present the combination of an electrophilic iron complex with pre -activation of - alkyl substituted -diazoesters reagents by the Lewis acid LiAl(ORF)4 [ORF= provides unprecedented access to functionalization of strong alkyl via -alkyl and with activity/selectivity levels similar to rhodium carboxylate catalysts. Mechanistic investigations reveal a crucial role of the lithium cation in the rate determining formation of the electrophilic iron -carbene intermediate, which then proceeds via concerted insertion into the C H bond.

Artificial Metalloenzymes (ArMs) result from the introduction of an abiotic metal cofactor into a protein framework. ArM's combine the selectivity and control of enzymatic processes with the wide - range of synthetically useful transformations catalysed by t ransition metals. The substrate specificity and regioselectivity provided by the protein framework then enables their use in complex mixtures .1 Attaching the metal complex with designed ligands to a specific place on the protein, remains a key challenge in the development of efficient ArM' s. To date, the m ost successful ArM's either involve; a linker,2 substitution of an endogenous metal ,3 or artificial amino acids .4 Our approach looks to introduce a cat alytically inert Ru(II) arene scaffold directly to a cysteine residue which upon protein coordination the catalytic activity of the ruthenium cofactor is unmasked . Direct coordination is beneficial as it has the potential to be applied to a variety of protein scaffolds and doesn't rely on linker technology, which means there can be direct influence of protein energetics on the metal centre. Using a relatively inert pre -catalyst means that there are fewer p ossible side reactions, and any catalytic activity can be attributed to the metal -protein hybrid. We have observed intriguing reactivity with the Ru(II)( arene)( bipyridine) f ragment and mutant of human u biquitin. The [Ru(II)(Arene)(H -Bipy)Cl ] complex binds relatively slowly to the cysteine residue , and the bipyridyl ligand remains coordinated, however, fluorinated complex [Ru(II)(Arene)(F 2-Bipy)Cl] binds rapidly at equimolar Ru:Protein concentration, involves loss of the difluoro -bipyridyl ligand. The reactivity can be attenuated by using differently donating arene ligands. Our goal is to be able to directly coordinate ruthenium pre -catalysts to polypetptides and control the coordination environment around the metal , just as biology does with Co in vitamin B 12 and Fe in heme, for example. We hope to be able to develop this methodology into a range of different protein scaffolds and observe catalytic activity. References [1] M. Jeschek, R. Reuter, T.

It appears in diverse functional forms, such as Fe/S, S- adenosylmethionine (SAM) radica l, heme iron, and mononuclear and binuclear nonheme iron enzymes. An important common theme for all of these species is that their chemistry is closely related to their redox properties. Herein, we present a computational methodology for calculation of red uction potentials of multinuclear iron enzyme active sites, including SAM radical enzymes. First, the methodology is validated on a large series of biomimetic compounds, including non- heme iron complexes and iron -sulfur [Fe4S4] clusters [1,2] .Then, it is extended to calculate the reduction potentials of particular multinuclear iron enzymes to associate redox properties with their reactivity. Radical SAM enzymes catalyze diverse reactions through a homolytic SAM cleavage. Recently, the organometallic intermediate was suggested to be an integral part of the catalytic cycle of pyruvate formate detailed insight into the mechanism of reductive cleavage of SAM by calculating the reduction potentials of all key intermediates along the reaction coordinate, including the intermediate.

Stemming from the serendipitous discovery of cisplatin as a potent anticancer chemotherapeutic, the field of metal -derived anticancer agents has flourished. In attempts to improve the activity and toxicity profile of metal - based drugs, transition metal redox coupling between higher and lower charged states has been employed to activate drugs within hypoxic , reducing, tumour environments . This redox ability modulat es the physiochemical properties of the metal centre especially with respect to the aqueous stability of the complexes . This results in higher oxidat ion state metal centres typically hav ing slower ligand exchange kinetics when compared to the lower oxidation state equivalents. With this in mind, CoIII drug complexes have been developed utilising the hypoxia induced reduction to CoII as an activation mechanism for site selective ligand release.1 Hydroxamic acids are bidentate ligands which coordinate to metal centres through an O,O' -binding motif forming a 5- membere d chelate ring .2 Hydroxamic acid -derived drugs generally target metalloenzymes by coordination to the central metal ion such as the binding of vorinostat to the ZnII ion within histone deacetylase.3 In order to generate stable CoIII complexes which are only reduced in situ , they require ancillary ligands to optimise the redox potential of the metal centre to ensure site specific reduction by cellular reductants with oxygen acting as a sacrificial electron donor in normoxic conditions.4 The use of the tetraazamacrocycles, such as cyclen and cyclam , have been the most promising for delivering O,O' -hydroxamic acid- based drugs to tumours as they successfully stabilise the +3 oxidation state, are stable long -term in aqueous solution and cyclam being the first ancillary ligand to generate a quasi -reversible CoIII/CoII couple by cyclic voltammetry.

This requires bioorthogonal reactions which do not undergo side reactions with other functional groups present in a particular biological system [1 -3]. Recently, an interesting new method was reported for the modification of the -amino groups of lysine residues in lysozyme in a Mannich- like reaction with indole derivatives under retention of the native charge [4] .To extend this method to organometallic protein labelling, we have synthesized a family of indole (Cp 2Fe) groups attached to different positions on the 6 -membered ring of indole to study their conjugation efficiency with lysozyme and compare it to that of commercially available organic indoles. Conjugate formation was analyzed with high-resolution ESI mass spectrometry. In addition, covalent docking simulations were carried out to determine the most accessible lysine side chains and to elucidate the steric influence of the protein surface as well as that of the indole derivatives through the empirical scoring functions ASP and DSX in GOLD.

P098 Stepwise Reduction of Nickel Center Jinseong Gwak1,Yunho Lee1 1Department of Chemistry, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) Daejeon 34141, South Korea. NO xconversion involving multi -step reduction processes to produce N 2is recently receiving much attention due to environmental and social issues. According to the substantial use in industry and agriculture, nitrates has become a crit ical water pollutant and it demands harsh reaction conditions to be reduced. As a main detrimental components of exhaust gas, NO 2, NO and N 2O also should be converted effectively under the flue gas conditions . In nature, such conversion known as denitrific ation occurs via a multi -step process to reduce to dinitrogen (NO 3-NO 2-NO N 2O N 2)as a part of biological nitrogen cycle. Although the efficient enzymatic reactions attractively operate under mild conditions, four different metalloenzymes are needed to convert a series of intermediate NO xspecies. In other words, their applications to the NO xconversion catalyst are limited due to the complications of reaction path that comes from the inherent biological purpose. Herein, a stepwise reducti on from nitrate to dinitrogen at a single nickel center will be presented. A PNP nickel scaff old (PNP-= N[2 -PiPr2-4-Me- C6H3]2) emerged as a universal platform for the deoxygenation of NO xsubstrates. In these reactions carbon monoxide acts as the oxygen acceptor and forms CO 2to provide the necessary chemical driving force. Whereas the rst two oxygens are removed from the Ni -nitrate and Ni -nitrite complexes with CO, the deoxygenation of N O requires a disproportionation reaction with another NO molecule to form NO 2 and N 2O. The nal deoxygenation of nitrous oxide is accomplished by the Ni -NO complex and generates N2and Ni -NO 2in a relatively slow, but clean reaction. This sequence of react ions is the rst example of the complete denitrication of nitrate at a single metal -site and suggests a new paradigm of connecting CO and NO xas an e ffective reaction pair for NO xremoval.

Gold have been extensively investigated as potential anticancer metallodrugs and have shown a high potential regarding antiproliferative effects [1-4].Enhanced stability is a driving argument for the design of gold organometallics , the more surprising is the lack of methods for pharmaceutical analytics of their stability and solution chemistry. Such analytic almethods are important key elements for future pharmacokinetic studies and will help to ensure a better understanding oftheir biological behavior [5]. We selected complexes of the type of alkynylgold(I)(NHC) for detailed stability studies by HPLC - DAD- MS,in comparison to the well -known antirheumatic agent Auranofin. A RP -based chromatographic method was established to se parate possible degradation products of alkynylgold(I)(NHC) complexes. The stability studies were performed at 37\u00b0C over using dimethylformamide (DMF), Dulbecco`s modified eagle medium (DMEM) solutions of each compo und. Furthermore, interaction experiments of alkynylgold(I)(NHC) complexes with a cetylcystein eare under way with the same set -up as the stability tests [6]. ESI(+)and ( -) ionisation with a quadrupole analyser was used for mass spectrometry. The first results indicate that alkynylgold(I)(NHC) complexes are stable over extended periods in the mentioned solvents with no significant changes in the irAUCs [Fig 1] .

In the past decade, only a few new antibiotics have come onto the market, while the emergence an d spread of highly resistant bacteria has continued to increase. As a result, the need for the effort to develop and discover new natural and synthetic antibioti c agents has increased recently.[1] One promising new low hemolytic activity and toxicity against human cell lines, has a bactericidal effect on Gram - positive bacteria such as MRSA.[2]The short cationic peptide interacts with or even partly cover the cell membrane. Unfortunately, the first case of resistance against a membrane- targeting antimicrobial agent was recently discovered.[3] Albada et al. tried to membrane -targeting peptide by an insertion of peptide structure. Thereby, the deceleration of enzymatic degradation and the fast destruction of bacteria strains w ere established. Unfortunately, the mechanism of action by insertion of metallocene with redox active metal s into RW -rich peptides were unsuccessful. However, the activity against several Gram -negative and Gram -positive bacteria increased significantly.[4] The essential transition metal cobalt (Co) exhibits favourable redox chemistry (Co(II/III )) and might actas prodrugs .[5]Therefore, the cobalt species itself can act an effector and cause oxidative stress in cells, which might lead to changes in the mechanism of action of membrane -targeting peptides.[5-6] Additionally, the Co(III)- peptide conjugates might decelerate enzymatic degradation of peptides through their stability. In this work, the different supramolecular cobalt(III)- peptide conjugates of different RW -rich peptides are synthesized (figure). T o glean information on the size and shape, as well as to probe i ntermolecular complex formation diffusion order ed spectroscopy (DOSY) was used. Thereby, the intermolecular formation of only one product after complexation with cobalt was indicated. Next, the m inimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined to provide the first data about the biological activity of the prepared cobalt -peptide conjugates. Our poster will show formation and structure of complexes, which was confirmed based on the obtained dif fusion coefficients from DOSY NMR experiments. Therefore, our poster will show the general trend in the observed MIC values of peptides and their cobalt - conjugates.

Since the discovery of Nitric Oxide (NO) as one of the major signal -transduction molecules in cells, there have been many attempts to devise acute NO -delivering systems for the purpose of developing disease therapies as well as studying cell functi ons. Metal -nitrosyl complexes are often releasing NO by light activation. This ability can be adapted to killing cancer cells with high specificity because high concentration of NO in cells induces apoptosis. Among them, ruthenium nitrosyl complexes have b een proposed as attractive photodynamic therapeutic agents in biomedicine and in tumor treatment. We researched ruthenium nitrosyl complex with salophen ligand, [Ru( )(NO)(salophen)Cl]. This at developing ruthenium nitrosyl complexes which ab sorb long wavelength visible light to release NO and are dissolved in water. We introduce new ligands with hydroxyl group on the positions of ortho, meta and para of the salophen ligand in order to increase the solubility in water. In this study, we show the NO -releasing properties of the complexes monitored by UV -VIS, IR spectroscopy and EPR which can be interpreted as that the diamagnetic [Ru -NO]6electronic state of the complex becomes low -spin Ru() (d5, S=1/2) state upon losing NO by photoactivation.

Metal -ligand cooperation (MLC) that the metal center and the ligand participate in the key transformations has been studied widely .Our group recently established a distinctive MLC of a tridentate bis(phosphin ophenyl )phosphido ligand (PPP - nickel(II) alkoxide complex converts into phosphinite [1]The two -electron redox change at the nickel center comes along with the geometric change from the square planar to pseudo- tetrahedral. In the case of anickel(II) anilido complex ,an anionic phosphido radical is generated upon the addition of CO(g) followed by the P-P bond coupling to form a dinuclear complex and the isocyanate generation. [2] The unique MLC of a PPP ligand is attributed to the HOMO possessing a dominant central phosphorus atom character based on the density functional theory analysis. The high covalency between a ligand and a metal center can induce an efficient electron transf er process .Thus, t he cobalt was introduced to the PPP ligand to increase the covalency of the central phosphorus and the metal center . The metalation of a ( PPP)Hligand with CoBr condition generates a dinuclear cobalt(I) complex, (P 2P-PP2)(CoBr) 2. This unusual P -P bond coupling reaction can occur through a single electron transfer between the PPP ligand and the cobalt center . Detailed redox activity of a PPP ligand cooperated with the cobalt center through a reversible P -P bond formation and cleavage will be discussed. References [1]Y.-E. Kim, S. Oh, S. Kim, O. Kim, J.

Since the discovery of the first antibiotics in the early 20th century, these agents were the first choice for the treatment of bacterial infections. However, the widespread use and the partial misuse of antibiotics in both humans and livestock has led to an increasing number of resistant bacteria. Therefor e, the development of novel antibiotic drugs with new modes of action is urgently necessary.[1] In the last decade, biorthogonal chemistry has become a promising tool for applications in imaging, drug development, and biotechnology. The term biorthogonal chemistry describes the performance of chemical modifications in living biological systems with the aim of not interfering with the host's biochemistry.[2] However, the performance of such modifications in living biological systems is challenging since suitable biorthogonal functional groups and catalysts need to fulfill certain requirements: the functional grou ps should be non -existent in nature and the catalyst should be stable in the presence of water, air, and small concentrations of thiols and other nucleophiles.[3] Meggers et al. initially demonstrated that the organoruthenium c omplex (shown in figure below) can catalyse the conversion of biorthogonal allyl carbamate s into their respective amines inside living mammalian cells by deprotecting of an inactive anticancer prodrug inside HeLa cells.[3] Despite promising results for the uncaging of an anticancer prodrug inside HeL a cells, this principle has not yet been tested for antibiotics in living bacteria cells.[4] Therefore, the aim of the ongoing project is to develop a suitable biorthogonal catalyst/substrate pair which can be used to perform catalytic deprotection reactions inside bacteria cells. This strategy could help to deal with the issue of resistant bacte ria.[5] For this strategy , were synthesized . Next , the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the protected prodrugs were determined to demonstrate that the allyl carbamate derivatives had loss their antibacterial activity. Parallel to the synthesis of the protected antibiotics, allyl carbamate derivatives of the well -known fluorescent dyes coumarin and naphthalene were synthesized which had yielded non -fluorescent protected dyes. The organoruthenium complex shown in the figure below can convert the inactive prodrugs and the non-fluorescent protected dyes under biological conditions (presence of water, air, and thiols) into their respective amines yielding either active antibiotics or fluorescence dyes. Our poster will show the optimized reaction conditions for the uncaging reactions under these conditions which were determined by using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry technique . The uptake of the catalyst inside the bacteria cells is crucial for the strategy planed in the ongoing project and therefore our poster will show the catalyst's cellular uptake which was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry measurements.

Platinum -based chemotherapeutics play an important role in the clinic for cancer treatment. For the further development of novel metal -based anticancer agents it is of utmost importance to elucidate the modes of action using bioanalytical methods . Promising novel anticancer agents are based on the piano - stool scaffold which confers a number of favourable properties and the biological activity can be modulated through the choice of m etal centre and/or ligands. This allows the design of complexes with specific functions through selective interaction with biological targets. N-Substituted 2 -pyridinecarbothioamides (PCA) are bidentate ligands with an S,N donor system . The attachment of a bidentate PCA ligand to an organometallic piano -stool scaffold led to the discovery of a promising chemotherapeutic with low micromolar activity in cancer cells [1].Oral administration to mice reduced tumour growth mor e efficiently in an invasive melanoma than in a colon cancer xenograft. To explore the mode of action of these complexes, a proteomics -based target -response profiling approach revealed very high selectivity (160 -fold) for the scaffold protein and cytolinke r plectin [2]. To study the interaction of the PCA complexes with plectin with our established bioanalytical toolkit [3], the large scaffold protein of 151 kDa was split into nine constructs consisting of approximately two domains each. These were expressed and purified with initial protein crystallographic hits achieved. ESI - MS was allowed identify ingfour out of eight constructs to interact with [Ru(cym)(PCA)Cl] Clover a period of three days The time into bisadducts (Figure) .

Owing to the near infrared absorption and photoinduced reactive oxygen production properties, phthalocyanine could provide an ideal therapeutic window for PDT treatment.1, 2Yet the high aromatic core may lead to aggregation and then undesi red quenching of reactive oxygen species, therefore we have designed short PEG -chain functionalized A3B type phthalocyanine (Pc) based photosensitizer, with not only increased solubility but also decreased aggregation. In this vein, we report the synthesis , structure determination, optical properties, cellular localization and cytotoxicity of a family of expanded phthalocyanine analogues. The stepwise functionalization of the peripheral moieties effects the solubility, cell uptake, cell localization and the n cytotoxicity. A follow up structure -activity relationship analysis investigating the impact of lipophilicity modification revealed the presence of malonic ester functionality as indispensable to confer cytotoxicity to the Pc series. The mitochondria targ eting MLC31 gave a 748) in cisplatin -resist A2780/CP70 cell line, with very low light toxicity (IC50 = 157 nM), and barely no dark cytotoxicity (IC50 = 117 \u00b5 M). In addition, we carried out a preliminarily investigation of aspects of cytotoxicity and present evidence that, upon near infra- red (NIR) light irradiation, MLC31 disrupt the mitochondrial membrane potential, and induce apoptosis. Furthermore, it remained similar cytotoxicity even under hypoxic condition. In conclusion, MLC 31 may serve as an effective photosensitizer for NIR light mediated PDT in antitumor therapy.

However environmental problems are also pointed out in these days with respect to increased consumption of the nanoparticles [1]. For the reason, studying environmental behaviors of nanoparticles is important issue t o expect the possible problems to the living things. Among the organisms, plants are regarded as good study model to monitor effects caused by nanoparticles since they have high chance to be exposed to nanoparticles and presented as predator in the food -chain [2,3]. In here, we studied physiological effects of quantum dots (QDs) to plants in order to evaluate risk assessment as food. As known, QDs is nanoparticles highly applied for the industry due to its noteworthy optical and electronic properties.

Arsenic (As) is highly toxic metalloid that poses serious hazards to virtually all livings. Treatments of As-polluted soils by using a phytoremediation approach with hyperaccumulators may provide an eco- friendly means to prevent environmental and health disturbances caused by As. Studies indicated that certain Pteris spp./varieties can hyperaccumulate As, sparking the research interest in the biology of As in (hyper)accumulating ferns. Here we report on accumulation and intracellular As species in three ferns, P. cretica var. Parkerii, P. cretica var. Albo -lineata and P. straminea . Following the sampling (fronds and r oots separated) of plants grown in soils amended with 20, 100 and 250 mg As kg-1dwt for 30, 90, and 180 days, the As analyses revealed striking hyperaccumulation trait in the var. Albo -lineata (up to 3.7 and 1 g kg-1dwt of frond and root tissues, respectively, after 90 days), but not the var. Parkerii or P. straminea (respectively, frond and root As after 90 days of 0,19 and 0.12 or 0,22 and 0,15 g kg-1dwt). Irrespective of the accumulation status, the analysis of t he tissue extracts revealed virtually all As unbound with any peptidaceous ligands, such as phytochelatins (PC) -Glu-Cys) nGly, PCn), known to bind with thiophilic As species. Although the levels of PC2 increased in a As dose- dependent manner in all ferns (minute PC3 was detected only in P. straminea ) the molar levels of potential As -binding (PC) were three orders of magnitude lower that the concentrations of intracellular As, indicating that PCs may have only minor, if any, role in handling of As in the investigated ferns. Current data thus indicate that hyperaccumulation trait of P. cretica var.Albo -lineata does not rely on its distinct ability to sequester As as or biotransform it into a \"hyperaccumulator -specific\" species. To follow up in a se arch for As tolerance determinants in var. Albo -lineata, the coding sequence of its predicted 134 -amino acid arsenate reductase (88% identical to the enzyme) obtained from the frond transcriptome for further studies.

After fertilization or chemically -induced egg activation, mammalian eggs release billions of zinc ions in events known as 'zinc sparks'. This discharge of zinc has been shown to harden the zona pellucida by crosslinking its glycoprotein coat [1], and is be lieved to be one of several mechanisms required to prevent supernumerary sperm from entering a fertilized egg. Whether there is a direct effect of zinc on sperm has not been explored. Once in the female reproductive tract, ejaculated sperm undergo a number of maturation processes, including capacitation, to become activated for fertilization. Fertilization occurs after the sperm undergoes the acrosome reaction, which is a process by which a capacitated sperm releases proteolytic enzymes from the acrosome or ganelle to break down the glycoprotein matrix of the zona pellucida. Because the acrosome reaction occurs in close vicinity to the egg and facilitates fertilization, we hypothesize that the high local zinc levels inhibit the acrosome reaction of sperm that may have bound immediately after the fertilizing sperm and thus further prevent polyspermy. To investigate this question, the acrosome reaction was induced by calcium ionophore A23187 or progesterone, and multiple concentrations of zinc sulfate were added to simulate the conditions after the zinc spark. The treated sperm were stained with Coomassie blue to highlight whether the acrosome reaction occurred and analyzed under a bright field microscope to visually determine the frequency of acrosome reactions under these conditions. Preliminary data suggests sperm treated with zinc have a lower likelihood of undergoing the acrosome reaction and losing their stained acrosome, which indicates a repressed acrosome reaction. Additionally, acrosome reaction frequenc y varies inversely with concentration of zinc. These data support our hypothesis that one function of zinc in the extra -zygotic environment is to signal suppression of the acrosome reaction in the subordinate sperm that bind the zona pellucida.

About a half of enzymes are metalloenzymes. Intracellul ar metal availabilities are important because some metals form more stable complexes with proteins than do others. Correct metalation can be achieved if cells 'level the playing field' by maintaining the tighter binding metals at lower availabilities than the weaker binding ones but it has been challenging to define and measure intracellular metal - availabilities. We previously established that DNA -binding, metal -sensing, transcriptional regulators are tuned to the available buffered levels of the metals that they detect [1]. This means that metal sensors provide a window through which to observe metal availabilities inside a cell, provided we can determine their tuning. We have determined the tuning of a complete set of metal sensors for different essential metals from Salmonella [2]. This data set can be used to explain the correct metalation of metalloproteins. The various metal affinities of the cobalt chelatase, CbiK, involved in vitamin B 12biosynthesis have been determined and compared against the series of metal availabilities. Within the metal controlled environment of the Salmonella cytosol CbiK will selectively acquire cobalt in preference to other metals, thus explaining the correct metalation of sirohydrochlorin during vitamin B 12biosynthesis. Buf fering of metals is essential to prevent mis -metalation of sirohydrochlorin and under this regime a chelatase is required for cobalt acquisition by sirohydrochlorin.

The mechanism of function of light harvesting complexes has been a subject of intense scientific research. Chlorophyll (Chl) in plants and bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) in photosynthetic bacteria are the major light harvesting pigments to carry out the desired energy converting photochemical reactions. Among all m etallochlorophylls, the complex eswith Mg2+havethe highest tendency to bind axial ligands [1],which are essential for the correct binding of the pi gment [2] and for the correct folding of the pigment -protein complexes [3]. For this and other reason s,heavy metals (such as Cu, Zn, Ni and Mn) can be toxic to photosynthetic organisms , as they can replace the central magnesium ( Mg2+)present in C hl and BChl ,being this replacement non-functional in photosynthesis [4]. In the present study , using the anoxygenic purple bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum (R. rubrum ),we investigated the influence of relatively low Cu2+concentrations (that can occur under current environmental condition s)on the photosynthetic apparatus of this organism .This was accomplished by a combination of in vivo measurements of flash photolysis and fast fluorescence kinetics ,combined with the analysis of metal binding to pigments and pigment -protein complexes isolated from Cu2+-stressed cells by HPLC -ICPMS (ICP -sfMS). Our results suggest that Cu2+is incorporated in the BChl and this shift of metal centres in BChl from Mg2+to Cu2+can occur in vivo in the RCs of R. rubrum under environmentally realistic Cu2+ concentrations (already at 2 \u00b5M Cu2+), leading to a strong inhibition of the function of these photosynthetic RCs. The inhibition of growth and of RC sactivity was related to the formation of Cu - containing BChl degradation products ,that occurred much more in the RC than in LH1. This finding is important because only very few earlier studies dealt with copper toxicity in phototrophic bacteria and i n those, either much higher copper concentrations were applied, which led to entirely different effects, or inhibition of photosynthesis was not investigated [5].

Copper is an indispensable co -factor of several ubiquitous bio -chemical mechanisms in living organism . Among many proteins known to be involved in copper metabolism in cells, CTR1 predominantly account sfor the majority o f metal uptake into cells . However, studies demonstrated that CTR1 inactivation does not completely inhibit copper uptake into cells hinting at the existence of alternate uptake pathways within cells. We have been exploring the ability of neuropeptides, particularly neurokinin B (NKB) , to bind copper. (1 )The effect of copper on neuropeptide structure can have significant impact of cellular function, and for some neuropeptides the complex can alter cellular signalling pathways. (2) The binding of copper by NKB can lead to increases in intracellular copper, yet l ittle is known about the mechanisms and pathways by which neurokinin B can traffic copper .To begin to address this, we used fluorescein -labelled apo-NKB ( apo-FNKB) and copper - bound FNKB to track the peptide in the cell, and immunofluorescence to follow trafficking of the NKB cognate receptor (NK3R) on ligand activation. We show that copper -bound FNKB is taken up into the cell in dense endosom al vesicles and localises to the perinuclear region more rapid lythan apo -FNKB .Studies also demonstrated that from these dense sorting endosom es,the copper -NKB -NK3R complex relocates into either Rab 5 regulated early endosomes enabling recycling of both metal and peptide near to the plasma membrane. More vesicles undergo late endosom al fusion with LAMP 1 regulated lysosomes in the perinuclear region .We speculate that this lengthy transport mechanism facilitates the copper dissociation from the NKB to metal - binding motifs on NK3R which facilitate smetal shuttling into nuclear comp artments .We predict th atreceptor mediated endocytosis accounts for the increased cellular copper concentration s by copper -bound NKB and mimics an uptake mechanism only previously observed for iron .(3) References [1]Russino D, McDonald E, Hejazi L, Hanson GR, Jones CE.

Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA . Zinc fluxes are important for mammalian oocyte meiosis. Total intracellular zinc significantly increases between prophase I and metaphase II . Following fertilization , zinc is released from the zygote's cortical granules in a process described as \"zinc sparks\". The released zinc hardens the zona pellucida, acting as a block to polyspermy. We sought to determine if the release of zinc at fertilization is conserved in Xenopus laevis , the African Clawed Frog . X. laevis is a model organism with many applications in developmental biology and is amenable to biochemical inter rogations. Using confocal microscopy, we found that the zinc efflux is conserved in Xenopus at the time of fertilization . A single zinc spark travels around the circumference of the zygote , taking around 3 minutes to reach the point opposite its origin. Proportionally less zinc is released from the frog zygote than the mouse zygote : ~20% of total intracellular zinc is released from a mouse zygote , while >1% is released from the frog. In addition to zinc, we monitored the overall elemental transitions during the time before and after sperm addition . Elemental change was quantitated using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP -MS). Zinc could not be detected by this method, likely due to a sensitivity issue, but we did detect an unexpected drop of intracellular manganese by 70%. To determine if the zinc and other metals exocytosed at the time of fertilization were within cortical granules, we analyzed egg slices via X -ray fluorescence spectro scopy (XRF) . Similar to mice, zinc stored in in cortical vesicles of frog eggs , albeit at a lower concentration (15 mM vs. 200 mM in mouse eggs ). XRF images show that significantly more metal- containing vesicles are stored in the animal pole, the half o f the egg containing the chromosomes and the site of sperm entry, than the vegetal pole, the half of the egg that serves as yolk storage. A higher -resolution analysis of these vesicles using scanning transmission electron microscopy energy dispersive X -ray spectroscopy confirm s our XRF results and shows that the diameter of the vesicles is around 500 nm. These are larger than mouse cortical granules, which average 260 nm in diameter. Surprisingly, not only zinc but copper, manganese, cobalt, and nickel are also stored in these vesicles. A subset of vesicles contain s a single metal, while most contain multiple metals stored at high micromolar to low millimolar concentrations. Some of these metals have biological roles in amphibians (zinc, copper, and mangane se), while others have few or no known roles (cobalt and nickel). Each of these elements was quantitated in the frog tank water and were present at nanomolar levels. These results indicate that zinc is released at the time of fertilization and stored in co rtical vesicles , similar to other zinc fluxes that take place around vertebrate fertilization. The frog differs from mouse and other mammals in the unexpected drop of intracellular manganese during this time interval and the presence of individual and mixe d metals in cortical bodies. It is not clear why amphibians accumulate metals like cobalt and nickel but given their physical environment, the egg may have adapted mechanisms that partition toxic elements that are present in the environment (water) away fr om genetic material. Further studies on the full spectrum of metal management in meiotic transitions and the specific role of zinc in meiotic progression and transition to mitotic embryos are ongoing.

CODH reversibly oxidized CO into CO 2, playing a central role in carbon metabolism of anaerobic microorganisms. The crystal structures of CODH from C. hydrogenoformans [1] and R. rubrum unique a [NiFe 3S4] cubane coordinated to a mononuclear iron site, known as C - cluster. While the reaction mechanism of CODH is well establis hed [ 3], very little is known about the activation of the C -cluster. Nickel insertion is essential for the enzyme activation and requires the intervention of the accessory proteins CooC, CooJ and CooT, able to supply the nickel into the CODH. Previously, C ooJ from R. rubrum (RrCooJ) has been described as a Ni chaperone with 16 histidines and 2 cysteines at its C -terminus [4]. Here we present our recent biochemical and structural characterization of CooJ, reporting the X -ray structure for a truncated ve rsion, combined with small- angle X -ray scattering (SAXS) data and a modelling study of the full -length protein. Using isothermal calorimetry, we characterized several metal - binding sites (four per dimer), involving the His -rich motifs and having similar me tal affinity (KD = 1.6 \u00b5M). Remarkably, biophysical approaches, site- directed mutagenesis and X -ray crystallography uncovered an additional Ni -binding site at the dimer interface. Although RrCooJ was initially thought to be a unique protein, a proteome dat abase search identified at least 46 bacterial CooJ homologs. These homologs all possess two spatially separated nickel -binding motifs: a variable C and a \"H -(W/F) -X2-H-X3-H\" motif, identified on our truncate dversion[5], suggesting a dual function for CooJ both as a Ni chaperone and as a Ni storage protein . References [1] H., in the biosynthesis of the thiopeptide antibiotic nosiheptide. This complex reaction involves i) the activation by a specific hydrogen -atom abstraction, ii) an unprecedented CO 2- radical migration, iii) a cyanide fragment release [ 2]and iv) the termination of the radical -based reaction. In vitro study of this reaction is made more difficult because the enzyme produces a significant amount of a shunt product instead of the natural product. We combin edX-ray crystallography, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and quantum and hybrid quantum mechanical / molecular mechanical calculations toinvestigate theCO 2-radical migration step.

Selective recognition of toxic metal ions may attract wide interest due to its potential medical and environmental applications. Understanding the details of bacterial metal ion regul atory mechanisms may forward the design of selectiv e metal ion binding molecules or develop sensitive metal ion detection techniques. Our study focused on the metal ion selective transcription regulator CueR protein that controls the intracellular concentration of Cu(I) ions in Escherichia coli [1]. The regulation is based on a conformational change induced by the cognate metal ion coordinated in to the metal binding loop influencing the structure of the protein -bound DNA and ultimately initiating the transcription of downstream genes [1]. The metal binding loop of the protein is followed by a short two turns helix continued in a disordered C -terminal region containing two cysteines in a CCHH motif . Thisso-called C- terminal helix has an allosteric role in the activation process . Upon metal ion binding of CueR the loop docks into a hydrophobic pocket resulting in a small \"scissor- type\" movement of the protein and the stabilization of the activator conformation [2]. Although CueR is one of the most thoroughly characterized protein in the MerR family, the mechanism of how it discriminates between mono and divalent metal ions is still not fully understood. Surprisingly, Hg(II) does not trigger the acti vation of transcription by CueR [1],despite the protein possesses a bis -thiolate coordination environment highly preferred by Hg(II). Furthermore, the role of the well-conserved cysteines of the C -terminal CCHH motif is still unclear. In this work we aim ed toinvestigate the molecular details of the metal ion recognition process andthe role of the C -terminal CCHH motif focussing on the binding of the non -cognate Hg(II) ion to CueR. W e performed studie s both with the native CueR protein and its truncated v ariant, lacking seven C -terminal residues (including the CCHH fragment ) with native mass spectrometry and 199mHg perturbed angular correlation of -rays (PAC) spectroscopy .The results presented will elaborate the effects of pH, metal ion to protein ratio on the coordination characteristics of the metal ion, and most importantly a possible role of metal ion binding amino acids outside the loop region in the protein f unction.

Iron sulfur (Fe -S) cluster cofactors are located in proteins involved in a diverse range of cellular processes including respiration, central metabolism and DNA repair. This versatile prosthetic group performs multiple functions including electron transport, transcriptional regulation, redox catalyst, and as a sulfur donor. An in creasing number of diseases are associated with impairment of Fe -S associated proteins and their maturation, including neurodegeneration. Therefore, an understanding of this machinery is essen tial. In bacteria, three systems responsible for the post -transcriptional Fe -S cluster generation and insertion into apo vivo are well known: the nif operon encodes the system responsible for maturation in nitrogenase, while proteins from the suf and isc operons generate housekeeping Fe -S clusters under stress and optimal conditions, respectively. The Isc assembly machinery, encoded by the iscRSUA -hscBA -fdx operon in E. coli , is the most widespread system and has direct orthologues in the eukaryotic mitochondrion. Studying the assembly of Fe -S clusters in this system will have direct implications in developing our understanding of human Fe -S cluster biogenesis. Among the Isc apparatus is IscS, a pyridoxial phosphate (PLP) containing desulferase which co nverts L- cysteine to alanine, generating sulfide that, along with iron, is used to build a [2Fe -2S] cluster on the scaffold protein, IscU. dimeric protein (~90 kDa), with each monomeric unit binding able to bind a single IscU protein [ 1]. Reconst itution of a [2Fe -2S] cluster on IscU using a source of cysteine, iron and reducing agents has been demonstrated [ 2,3]. Two further accessory proteins, IscX and CyaY (the bacterial orthologue to the eukaryotic protein frataxin) bind iron and also bind to t he same surface on IscS, thereby acting as regulators of Fe -S cluster biogenesis in response to accessible iron [ 4]. The exact source of iron is unknown. Further proteins are involved in the transfer of the cluster to the receiving apo -protein, has been used to investigate proteins in a folded state in which non -covalently bound cofactors, such as Fe -S clusters, remain intact. This technique has been used to dem onstrate the mechanism of O 2 induced [4Fe -4S] cluster degradation of FNR [ 5] and has also been used to study the association state of IscS and IscX [ 4]. This work employs the same technique to analyse the individual steps in Fe -S cluster biogenesis, -MS as a complex and analysing mass shifts upon the introduction of iron and sulfur species. Subsequent introduction of further assembly proteins, to identify complexes, will offer further insight into the process of Fe -S cluster biosynthesis. This work aims to address major remaining questions, including the nature of intermediates of Fe -S cluster assembly on IscU, the complex associations of Isc proteins, and the mechanism of transfer to accepting apo -proteins.

Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) containing a unique Mo- Cu active site from the aerobic bacterium Oligotropha carboxidovarans catalyzes the following reaction: 2+ 2H++ 2e. The catalytically active state is thought to be the Mo(VI) -Cu(I) state, and is reduced to Mo(IV) -Cu(I) state during catalysis. Despite the close to atomic resolution structure (1.1 \u00c5) for both oxidation states, major uncertainties remain with regard to the active site composition and geometry: equatorial oxo vs. hydroxo ligands coordinated to Mo, Mo/Cu oxidation and spin states, substrate binding, and intermediates during the catalytic cycle [1]. To address these ambiguities, various QM and QM/MM models of CODH were developed systematically, and were used to examine various oxidation/spin states, as well as the protonation states of the Mo -coordinated equatorial ligand (O2,OH,H2O), and point mutations in key residues surrounding the CO binding pocket. Our QM model revealed important second sphere interactions that are essential for maintaining a unique geometry of the CO binding cavity [2]. Study of catalytic transformation of CO and H 2O are currently underway using our QM and QM/MM models. We will provide insights of the involvement of Mo and Cu, and other important active site residues during the catalytic conversion of CO and H 2O.

The design of this artificial enzyme is inspired by iron(III) -chelating siderophores used by bacteria to scavenge iron from the irenvironment. In anchoring the synthetic catalyst to a siderophore, we can bury the catalyst inside a protein with a high -affinity for the Fe(III)- siderophore conjugate [2].A variety of synthetic catalysts ca n be used depending on the transformation the enzyme is required to perform .The non-covalent nature of the binding between the synthetic catalyst and the protein component in this design allows for reversible binding of the synthetic catalyst. The natural mechanism bacteria use to release iron inside the cell is reduction of Fe(III) t o Fe(II), triggering dissociation [3]. This release mechanism can be exploited to allow the recovery and recycling of the components of the artificial enzyme ,including valuable protein. Designing a toolbox of synthetic catalysts with redox- reversible anch oring groups allows the construction of artificial metalloenzymes tuned for specific synthetic transformations.

Metallothioneins (MTs) are small, cysteine -rich proteins that bind d10metal ions with high affinity, thereby playing major roles in metal storage and detoxification. Of the four human MT isoforms (MT - 1/4), only MT -3, an isoform expressed in the brain, exhibits growth inhibitory activity and protects neurons from amyloid - toxicity. Despite the conservation of all 20 cysteines which coordinate Zn(II) or Cu(I) in metal thiolate clusters in all isoforms, MT -3 shows a copper -thionein character while MT -2 possess eshigher zinc selectivity \u2014features that underlie these isoforms' sp ecific functions. In this work, we used a combination of spectroscopic and biochemical techniques to investigate the structural features in MT -3 fundamental to its unique Cu -thionein character. We reveal, by studying rates of Cu(II) reduction and Cu(I) bin ding, that Zn 7MT-3 binds Cu(I) significantly faster Zn 7MT-2. Using with metal -selective chelators, we show that Cu(I) 4Zn4MT-3 possess esa higher affinity for Cu(I) than MT -2 in its N -terminal -domain, whereas Zn 7MT-2 shows higher s electivity for Zn(II) than MT -3. From mutational studies, we showed that the Thr -Cys-Pro-Cys-Pro motif unique in MT -3 is critical for its metal selectivity bias for Cu(I). We also dissected key roles of other residues in modulating cluster dynamic sand met al exchange rates, in increasing the Cu(I) -affinity in MT -3 and/or modulating the higher stability of the Zn(II) -thiolate cluster in MT -2 -domain. We thus engineered MT -3 variants in which the copper -thionein character is converted into zinc -thionein. Thu s, we have identified isoform -specific non - coordinating residues in MT -3 that impart its copper selectivity and reactivity which are fundamental for its roles in copper homeostasis and controlling aberrant Cu -protein interactions.P149 Inner -Sphere nergies of H t Cytochrome c: Role of Two L Bren2, Abhishek Dey1 1School of Chemical Sciences, Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, Jadavpur, Kolkata - 700032, WB, India . 2Department of Chemistry, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, 14627 -0216, USA. Electron transfer (ET), the act of moving an electron from one place to another, is the simplest chemical process yet certainly crucial in most biological processes . It also plays key role in the reduction of molecular O 2 to H 2O in mitochondria where cytochrome c, a mitochondrial membrane bound protein drives electrons from complex III (coenzyme Q - cytochrome c reductase) to complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) during the process. The kinetics of ET depends on several factors like the driving force (G) of the process , reorganization energ ies () of the involved species and the ET coupling element between donor and acceptor (H DA). Reorganization energy , , is summation of inner -sphere and outer -sphere where the former part can be calculated from the change in equilibrium bond distance upon ET and the energy associated with the change in the solvent sphere around the electroactive species during ET represents the later part.1 Among the c (HtWt ) is one of the most studied monoheme proteins due to its spontaneous cytoplasmic maturation when expressed in E. coli. The main feature of H tWt Cyt c is the fluxionality of its axial methionine group ligated to the heme iron which makes it unique for scientific studies.2 Diversity in the orientation of the h istidine -methionine ligand to the heme iron is believed to play a major role in the ET mechanism of cytochrome c family and therefore recent research es focus on the effect of such fluxional orientation s of methionine on the ir ET. Single point mutation on the wild type (WT) protein shows that the 64th amino acid residue , glutamine is responsible for such fluxional orientation of the axial methionine group . Mutation of 64th residue with valine (HtQ64V) and a sparagine (HtQ64N) restricts the orientation of th at methionine group and provides two different conformations , R and S in the H tQ64V and HtQ64N , respectively. In spite of a decade of dedicated research , neither value of these mutants nor the effect of methionine conformation upon is reported . We have optimized r otating disc electrochemistry (RDE), a d ynamic electrochemical technique to measure the total of HtWt and two of its mutants in solution. We have also determined the inner -sphere of these proteins using chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry by immobilizing the proteins on top of Au electrodes modified with self -assembled monolayer of thiol carboxylic acid . Our studies suggest that HtQ64V has the smallest value whereas the HtWt has the highest value of which is directly related to the conformations of the axial methionine in the proteins . The theoretical calculations also shed light into the factors responsib le for the difference s in the value of upon single point mutation Axial Ligand, Spin State, and Hydrogen Bonding on the Inner -Sphere Reorganization Energies of Functional Models of Cytochrome P450.

A consensus on the mechanism of electron/proton transfers remains elusive because of the lack of essential knowledge on the complete redox cofactors and substrates distributed in the QFR structure .To clarify the mechanism of QFR, we have determined the crystal structure of QFR purified directly from large amounts of the cell membranes of the bacterium Desulfovibrio gigas under anaerobic conditions. Here we present the crystal structure of QFR from the anaerobic sulphate ) resolution. The structure of the D. gigas QFR is a homo -dimer, each protomer comprising two hydrophilic subunits, A and B, and one transmembrane subunit C. In our structure, a bound menaquinone and all the redox cofactors including two b-hemes are clearly revealed. One menaquinone molecule is bound near heme b Lin the hydrophobic subunit C [1]. This location of the menaquinone -binding site differs from the menaquinol -binding cavity proposed previously for QFR from Wolinella succinogenes . The observed bound menaquinone might serve as an additional redox cofactor to mediate the proton- coupled electron transport across the membrane. On the basis of these new structural insights and comparison with the structures of QFRs from other organisms including both prokaroytes and eukaroytes, it is possible to clarify the roles of the two b hemes in the electron -bifurcation pathway in the menaquinol oxidation, and we have delineated the mechanism of proton -coupled pathways from the periplasm across the membrane during the transfers of the reducing equivalents fr om the quinol to fumarate in D. gigas QFR [1].

We have determined the three- dimensional structure of FccA to 1.85 \u00c5and investigated thekinetics of methacrylate reducti onby . Purification of the remaining proteins for X -ray structural evaluation is currently being pursued. Our goal is to characterize the complex in atomic detail to understand the molecular determinants that modulate the functionality of the protein and the ex act role of the FAD cofactor during catalysis.

It is known that the protein matrix plays important role in directing the electrons and protons to their respective positions with very little or no overpotential [1,2]. This project is aimed at identifying specific motions at the TNC, that result in decre asing the overpotential for oxygen reduction reaction . Small laccase with the copper in the T1 centre removed (mutant T1D) , expressed and isolated from E.coli , was used as the preferred system to study the dynamics at the TNC. Using 1D WEFT NMR experiment and sample s prepared in 90% H 2O/10% D2O buffer, buffer exchanged to 100% D 2O and perdeuterated with complete proton exchange, exchangeable and non -exchangeable protons were identified. We report that most of the paramagnetically shifted resonances are from exchangeable protons , which sugges ts that the efficiency of proton transfer arise s due to this property. We also report the first high resolution 1H-1H NOESY NMR spectra of paramagnetically shifted proton resonances using mixing time of 3 ms to 8 ms and the first solid state NMR proton spectra of the paramagnetically shifted resonances, that will lead to the assignment of the resonance and extracting associated dynamical property . The high resolution and sensitivity of the resonances can be attributed to the strong Cu -Cu coupling at the TNC as reported previously from temperature dependence of the 1D NMR spectrum, a result in line with EPR results [3,4]. We hope that such NMR study will shed some light on the effects of dynamics of the protein matrix in modulating the oxygen reduction mechanism at the TNC of SLACt1D .

Biological nitrogen fixation relies on nitrogenases, the only enzymes capable of reducing dinitrogen (N2) into ammonium (NH 4+). Nitrogenases can be divided in four groups according to their protein sequence s: groups A, B and C are molybdenum nitrogenases, and group V represents the \"alternative\" vanadium cofactor where the reaction takes place. This cofactor is coordinated by a cysteine residue at position 275, and a histidine at position 442 [2]. Among molybdenum nitrogenases, although group A (e.g. of group B (e.g. of Azotobacter vinelandii ) nitrogenases have been thoroughly characterized, group C nitrogen ases remain understudied. These nitrogenases are mostly found in Archaea and thermophilic Firmicutes. In contrast to other nitrogenases, group C nitrogenases contain a glutamine at position 276 and an asparagine at position 440, and lack a residue correspo nding to the aromatic residue found at position 444. All three positions are occupied by conserved residues in each group of nitrogenases. To investigate the influence of these conserved residues on nitrogenase structure, maturation and catalysis, we generated strains of A. vinelandii bearing mutations at these positions, and isolated the resulting nitrogenase variants. Growth experiments and activity assays (acetylene reduction) on whole cells revealed that mut ated A. vinelandii grew slower and were less able to reduce acetylene than wild -type cells. Isolated variants also showed lower acetylene reduction activity. Finally, EPR spectroscopy on whole -cells and on the isolated enzymes showed new signals in the g = 3/2 region, suggesting that these nitrogenase variants contain isoforms of FeMo -co.

In metal limitation conditions, metallo -\u00df-lactamase s (MBL), and in particular NDM, lose activity against \u00df-lactams by dissociation of the Zn(II) cofactor, and the periplasmic accumulation in vivo of the enzymes decrease s. Since its discovery in 2008, NDM has shown a fast worldwide spread with 27 natural variants reported in the clinic. NDM variants differ by a few mutations outside the active site, with the substitution M154L being the most frequent. Studies in our group have shown that the tolerance to Zn(II) starvation is selected during the evolution of NDM. It has been reported that the mutation M154L increase s the resistance under zinc deprivation conditions in vivo without imparting protein stabilization. Moreover, all double mutants co ntaining M154L substitution have shown the highest resistan ce under Zn(II) deprivation conditions. Between them, the variant NDM -15 with mutations M154L and A233V was the least susceptible to metal depletion. In this way, we focus on the substitution M154L present on the natural variant NDM -4 as a single mutation and more than the half of the alleles. We aim to assess the biochemical and biophysical features that are tai lored by the mutation to endure the action of the immune system response. First, we measured the stability of the purified variants and their apo (non-metalleted) derivatives by thermal shift analysis. Alleles NDM -4 and NDM -15, presented slightly higher Tm values than NDM -1. Nevertheless , they all displayed the same Tm gap between holo (metallated ) and apo forms . These results indicate that the mutation M154L does not increase significantly protein stability. We performed competition experiments with Zn(II) chromophoric chelators. We prove d that substitution M154L impacts significant ly on the first binding event, without changing the affinity of the second Zn(II) ion. By UV -Vis spectroscopy and paramagnetic NMR studies with Co(II) substituted variants we demonstrated that the increment in Zn(II) affinity is not due to changes on metal coordination in the active site. 15N-1H HSQC spectra of almost superimposable , indicating that the mutation does not affect significantly the backbon e structure in solution as expected from the reported X- ray crystal structures. However, the HSQC spectrum of apo NDM -4 showed a lower amount of signals due to line broadening compared to apo NDM -1, reflectin g more structural flexibility of apo NDM -4. Overall, these results suggest that mutation M154L might be altering the dynamic or accessibility of residues near the active site in the apo -form consequently affecting metal affinity of the protein, mainly changing the first Zn(II) binding event.

Heme- Based Sensor DevS from Mycobacterium Tuberculosis : R edox versus Oxygen S ensor Giamwemberg Barreto1, Marta S. Portugal . 3School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia . Heme -based sensor s are a large family of proteins involved in the regulation of several relevant biological processes such as biofilm, chemo taxis, blood pressure, circa dian events, symbiosis , virulence, among others [1]. DevS is a heme -based sensor protein found in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) , the pathogen causing tuberculosis, which is a major cause of death around the world . This sensor is part of a key system involved in regulating the entrance into dormancy which is , per si, a crucial strategy to make the su ccess of this bacterium as a human pathogen . In 2007, right after this protein was shown to be a heme -based regulated sensor [2,3] , a conflict on the actual physiological signal emerged if it was either a redox or an oxygen sensor. Aiming to shed light on this issue and further study the electrochemistry behavior of this protein, w e carried out a series of spectroelectrochemistry measurements of the full - length holo DevS in anaerobic conditions as well as bound to CO, NO, imidazole (Imz) , CN- and O 2. Figure show s the electronic spectra of the non -liganded form of DevS at different applied potential s along with the curve s of Soret band vs potential in both the reductive (blue) and oxidative (black) directions . Interestingly, the midpoint redox potential (E m) as determined by spectroelectrochemistry correlate s well with the HOMO energies calculated for the GAF domain of the non -liganded DevS and li ganded to CO, Imz and CN- least squares fitting EHOMO = -5.91 - [8.8x10-4 mV \u00d7 E m]). This result enabled us to estimate the value of E m for DevSO2 as +170 mV, which is fully consistent with the experimental data , i.e. an E m value within the range +10 to +195 mV. Another interesting feature of this protein is the ability to bind imidazole even in the ferrous state, with measured dissociation constants of 112 and 0.300 mM for the ferrous and ferric states, respectively. Nonetheless, an E m value of +10 mV (vs NHE) for DevS as measured under anaerobic conditions is much higher t han the expected cytosolic potential for Mtb or even within stimulated macrophages ( ca. -270 mV vs NHE). This result, along with its great oxygen affinity and very slow auto -oxidation rate, discarded DevS as a redox sensor and further validated its biologi cal function as an oxygen sensor directly involved in the dormancy/latency of Mtb (see below the cartoon representation of the DevS function) .

O. Sigel1 1Department of Chemistry, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 19 0, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland. Zinc finger (ZnF) domains are one of the most physiologically relevant examples of metalloproteins, as they are present in about 3% of all genes in the human genome. They are part of transcription factors that regulat ediverse processes such as transcription, translation, or apoptosis. Beyond these roles ,ZnF proteins can also act as redox switches , sensing the cell redox status and triggering appropriate responses. This is possible because Zn(II)- coordinating cysteine residues are readily oxidized, leading to dissociation from the stabilizing Zn(II) ion along with loss of structure and loss of DNA -binding activity. In order to efficiently act as regulatory transcription factors under normal physiological conditions, ZnFs need to associate but also to dissociate readily from DNA . However, no dissociation mechanism is currently known. Dissociation under simultaneous Zn(II) release seems unlikely, since the level of free Zn(II) in the cell is virtually zero and no Zn(II) chaperones are known, and since one -time use of ZnFs woul d be highly inefficient. We therefore hypothesize that the dissociation of ZnFs from DNA involves oxidation -induced formation of an alternative structure in which Zn(II) remains bound. Thus, subsequent reduction ,of the ZnFs would easily restore its DNA- binding activity . Our central aim is to prove the existence of such an oxidized Zn(II)- binding structure under physiological conditions and to characterize it by NMR and X -ray crystallography. The structural role of alternative Zn(II) ligands is of pa rticular interest, and can be directly addressed if the structure is characterized. Similar oxidized Zn(II) -binding structures have been shown to exist e.g. in the nucleocapsid protein of HIV -11, and in in vitro oxidized ZnF models2, although the latter in volves the formation of sulfinate moieties, which might not be formed in vivo . Overall, this study is of fundamental interest in obtaining a structural and mechanistic understanding of the dissociation process of zinc fingers in general, and of their function as redox switches in particular.

Dynamics at metal sites is essential to protein function, but rarely characterized experimentally . Many biologically relevant metal ions exhibit nanosecond water exchange dynamics in aqueous solution [1], implying that this is a central time scale also at biomolecular metal binding sites. In addition, rotational diffusion of macromolecules occur son the ns time scale. Pe rturbed angular correlation (PAC) of - rays spectroscopy allows for determination of nanosecond metal site dynamics [2,3] as well as rotational correlation times of the entire protein. We compare literature data on rotational correlation times, c, determi ned by PAC spectroscopy with a simple theoretical model for rotational diffusion [4]. The simple model displays good qualitative agreement with the experimental data .Interestingly, deviation of the experimental data from the simple model may indicate either pronounced local metal site dynamics or deviation from spherical shape of the protein. Finally , we present a series of PAC experiments on a model protein [5]in solution, to determine c's correlation with the viscosity. Extrapolating to infinite viscosity, this may provide a tool to elucidate whether local metal site dynamics on the ns timescale contribute to the experimentally determined c. References [1]L.

[1]It is also known that SirB isable to use other types of divalent metals (e.g. Co2+) as substrates with sirohydrochlorin for synthesis the corresponding metallated sirohydrochlorins in vitro .[2]However, the structure of SirB and its catalytic mechanism has been unclear so far, although those of other types of class II chelatases (e.g. CbiK[3] and HemH[4] )are well-studied .Here,wereport structure of Co2+-bound SirB. [5]The overall structure ofSirB is similar to th ose of the other class II chel atases such as CbiK and HemH despite the irlow primary amino acid sequence identities (15 % or less ).More i nterestingly, the binding site for Co2+inSirB is distinct from those in CbiK and HemH: SirB uses its N -terminal as ligands whereas CbiK and HemH use their C -terminal regions with His and/or Gluas ligands .Structure -function relationship of SirB was further investigated reaction for the siro biosynthesis byusing Co2+and uroporphyrin available macrocyclic tetrapyrroles .As a result, uroporphyrin I , that is more structurally similar to sirohydrochlorin, was consumed as a substrate by SirB ,butprotoporphyrin IX was not. D ocking simulations of these two tetrapyrroles as well as sirohydrochlorin to SirB revealed that the substrate specificity of SirB was likely to be subject to the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions between the tetrapyrroles and some hydrophobic residues inside the SirB active site cavity .

Irvine1, 1Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry of at Dallas , 75080 , USA. 2Department of Biochemistry and 3Redox Biology Center and the Nebraska Center for Integrated Biomolecular Communication, University of Nebraska -Lincoln, Lincoln, NE 68588, USA . Transition metal selectivity in P 1B-type ATPa se primary active transporters is determined by conserved amino acid motifs on transmembrane helices embedded in the lipid bilayer that are responsible for metal selection and transport across membranes. We report on the coordination chemistry of the trans membrane metal binding site in a Zinc P-Type ATPase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ZntA ) to reveal the coordination principles which govern the defined, yet promiscuous, metal selectivity of the pump. In this study, we generated wild -type and truncated ZntA in which the N -terminal metal binding domain (N -MBD) has been deleted and characterized them in detergent micelles and reconstituted in artificial lipid bilayers. Truncation of the N -MBD preserves the metal selectivity and functionality of the Zn-pump in a greement to the proposed catalytic regulatory role of the N -MBD. We show ed that the pump possess es promiscuous substrate selectivity toward both essential (Zn2+) and toxic metals (Cd2+, Hg2+ Pb2+). We generated forms of and perform ed biochemical and X -ray absorption spectroscopic studies to reveal the coordination chemistry underlying its substrate promiscuity. The results reveal the existence of an unprecedented highly -plastic transmembrane high -affini ty metal -binding site that confers metal selection by different coordination geometries and ligand -metal distances but relying on common coordination chemistry properties.

The cat alytic harbors the unique FeMo -cofactor ([Mo -Fe7-S9-C]) as its active site. Although the structure of this most active and best stud ied Mo variant has been solved [2], the mechanism of nitrogen fixation remains unclear. Two alternat ive enzymes, the vanadium [3] and iron -only [4] variants have been characterized. The vanadium variant of nitrogenase is also able to reduce CO to hydrocarbons, comparable to the Fischer -Tropsch process [5].Our recently described method allows for the pro duction and purification of vanadium- nitrogenase from M o-depleted bacterial cultures [6 ].This led to the structure determination of the catalytic 2K2G2of the vanadium nitrogenase an -subunit VnfG that is absent in the Mo -variant. Interestingly, Fe Vcofactor (FeVco) also replaces one sulfide with a bridging ligand, making it a [V -Fe7-S8-C] cluster. The different chemical character of the vanadium nitrogenase can help rationalize the altered chemical properties of this unique N 2and CO reducing enzyme. References [1]B.K. Burgess ,Chem. Rev.

It is known that Ni(II)- ions can induce peptide bond hydrolysis that occurs at the N -terminal side of Ser or Thr residues in peptides or proteins bearing X -(Ser/Thr)- X-His-X sequences (X being any amino acid except of Pro before or after Ser/Thr) [1-3]. Our current research focuse s on the possible applications of this hydrolytic reaction . (i) Ni(II)- induced peptide bond hydrolysis was applied to establish an ATCUN motif in situ at the N - termin al end of a zinc finger protein. The ATCUN motif is able to cleave DNA non-specifically [4]. We examined whether it can be turned into a specific artificial metallonuclease , in which the zinc finger domain recognizes the selected DNA sequence, while the ATCUN motif cleaves it. (ii) We optimized a protein purification method including the Ni(II) -induced hydrolysis reaction [5 ]. For simple protein purification a C -terminal affinity -tag is attached to the protein of interest. A new carrier DNA vector, allowing for complete removal of the tag after the affinity purification step was constructed . The gene coding for the native protein sequence was inserted directly before the DNA code of the SRH hydrolytically sensitive sequence followed by the code of the affinity tag. Thus, Ni(II) ions can be used to cleave the affinity tag instead of expensive and sensitive proteases. Our method is optimis ed for the expression and purification of protein s with precise native sequence s. (iii) We found that the Ni(II)- induced cleavage reaction can also be suitable for activatio n of allosterically inhibited enzymes . The Ni(II)- sensitive overhang was fused to otherwise catalytically active NColE7 -type nucleases , and the DNA cleavage was monitored. The results obtained by UV and CD spectroscopy, ICP and ESI mass -PAGE electrophoresis will be presented .

The R2 subunit of the mammalian RNR ctor, reaction mechanism in the catalytic R1 subunit. As RNR plays a crucial role in nucleic acid metabolism, it is subject for several clinical drugs, and the understanding of, and search for new RNR inhibitors is important fo r further optimization and development of new anticancer agents. Thiosemicarbazones are known for their versatile coordination chemistry, biological activity and theranostic applications. Triapine, e.g., an efficient R2 -inhibitor, has entered several clini cal trials. Thiosemicarbazones exert their biological effects through effectively binding transition metal ions, in particular, Fe(III). Dicopper(II) complexes have also shown great cytotoxicity in several cancer cell lines. In our studies, proligands able to form transition metal complexes, as well as dicopper(II) complexes were synthesized, and their antiproliferative effects were examined in various human cancer cell lines, where several of the compounds showed high cytotoxicity. Based on this, potential candidates were tested in vitro as potential R2 inhibitors. Their interaction with R2 and effect on the Fe(III) 2-Y cofactor was characterized with microscale thermophoresis such as EPR, rRaman and UV/vis spectroscopy. Our findings suggest that the newly- synthesized proligands and Cu(II) complexes could serve as effective antiproliferative agents in several cancer cell lines, targeting RNR, deserving further investigation as potential anticancer drugs [1]. Through ongoi ng studies, we also aim for a deeper explanation of the observed spectra by including DFT calculations for prediction of UV/vis and Raman spectra. In addition, ongoing and future studies on newly synthetized, potential R2 inhibitors are initiated. References of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden Developments in the recent years have made serial crystallography approaches more readily available to more users, both at synchrotrons and x -ray free electron lasers (XFEL). This allows design of novel experiments and new questions can b e asked in the field of structural biology. By collecting serial crystallography datasets at synchrotron or XFEL it is possible to design time resolved experiments with induction of a reaction e.g. via a pump laser or oxygen -exposure. Room temperature experiments are possible and allow mixing of the mother liquor with substrate, so that different time points can be recorded. Especially XFELs with their high brilliance allow the usage of crystals as small as a few micrometres in size and make atomic resoluti on accessible to biological systems that grow no sufficiently large crystals. For systems that are prone to radiation damage in steady state synchrotron data collection, like metalloenzymes, serial crystallography is a great opportunity, since synchrotron or XFEL serial crystallography can reduce or even eliminate the problem of radiation damage altogether. But serial crystallography also comes with its own set of challenges. In most cases large amounts of microcrystals are needed. They cannot be too fragil e and have to survive at room temperature for a longer period of time. The crystallization condition, crystal size and concentration need to be considered for the specific experimental setup. The optimization of sample for a serial crystallography experime nt differs therefore drastically from a single crystal synchrotron experiment. Working with metalloenzymes additionally requires to control the occupancy and redox states of the metal cofactors involved in order to be able to start the experiment with the right conditions. In this study experiences from sample preparation of metalloenzymes for serial crystallography will be presented and some challenges and their solutions will be discussed.482 483 ICBIC-19 ICBIC-19 Poster Presentations MetalloproteinsPoster Presentations Metalloproteins Book of Abstracts Book of AbstractsP165 Activating Bacteria by External Additives: Direct Conversion of Benzene to Phenol School of Science, Nagoya University, Aichi, Japan 2Research Center for Materials Science, Nagoya University, Aichi, Japan 3CREST, Japan Science and Technology, Tokyo, Japan Functionalization of unactivated carbon -hydrogen bonds remains a worthwhile goal in synthetic chemistry. Cytochrome P450BM3 (P450BM3), a heme enzyme isolated from B. megaterium , has thus gained prominence owing to its high monooxygenase activities toward long- chain fatty acids. However, since P450BM3 recognizes substrate sbythe carboxylate group in long -chain fatty acids, small molecules such as propane and benzene are not hydroxylated by P450BM3. To expand the potential substrate applicability of P450BM3, we reported a technique to remodel the active site of P450BM3 with shorter fatty-acid analogs (decoy molecule, Figure b ),instead established mutagenesis strategies[1, 2]. Decoy molecules bind to P450BM3 as a dummy substrate and thus initiates the catalytic cycle of the enzyme. On the other hand, shorter carbon chain can create the new reaction site inside the enzyme, permitting P450BM3 to oxidize non -native substrates accommo dated in the heme active site[3]. Unfortunately, P450BM3 has yet another serious problem of requiring expensive NADPH as electron donor, which limits the further application of decoy molecule system .To overcome this lim itation, we endeavored to develop awhole -cell reaction system, P450BM3- catalyzed hydroxylation is supported by intracellular NADPH supply through inexpensive sugar metabolism .We herein report the direct conversion of benzene to phenol catalyzed by recombinant Escherichia coli expressing wild -type P450BM3 by the simple addition of decoy molecules to theculture medium (Figure c) . In the absence of decoy molecules, benzene hydroxylation was scarcely proceeded with a phenol yield of only 0.4% at 10 mM substrate after 5 h reaction. However, a ddition of decoy molecules significantly enhanced the benzene hydroxylation depending on th e structure of decoy molecules , indicating that decoy molecules traversed cell membrane and thus activated P450BM3 even expressed in bacteria. Examined decoy molecules showed negligible cytoto xicity toward E. coli, asjudged from the growth inhibition activities of these molecules .Finally ,reaction conditions were optimized with C7-Pro-Pheas the decoy molecule, yielding up to 59% of phenol benzene[4].

P166 Can a Strong Equatorial Ligation Suppress Technology Bombay ,Powai ,Mumbai ,400076, India 2Department of Chemistry ,Central University of Haryana, Haryana, 123031, India High -valent iron -oxo species are known for its very high reactivity in biological system and this aspect has been studied in detail over the years. Particularly the role of axial ligands in fine -tuning the reactivity of the iron(IV) -oxo species are studied in detail. The role of equatorial ligands in fine -tuning the reactivity of such species is rarely explored and is of prime importance in the development of non -heme chem istry. Here, we have undertaken a detailed of cytochrome P450 [(Porphyrin)FeIV(O)(SH)]-(2) to probe this aspect. The electronic structures of 1 and 2are found to vary significantly and this has led to a large variation in the reactivity. Particularly, strong equatorial ligand present in 1 destabiliz es the quintet states significantly as compared to species 2 . To fully understand the reactivity pattern of this species, we have modelled the hydroxylation of methane by species 1 and 2. Our calculations reveal that species 1 reacts via low -lying S=1, -pathway and generally available S=2, -pathway is not energetically accessible. In addition to possessing a significant barrier for C -H bond activation, the - OH rebound step is also computed to have a large barrier height leading to a marked difference in r eactivity between these two species. Of particular relevance here is the observation of pure triplet state reactivity for species 1 . Besides we have also attempted to test the role of axial ligands in fine -tuning the reactivity of species 1 and our results demonstrate that in contrast to heme systems, the axial ligands in 1 do not significantly influence the reactivity. This highlights the importance of designing the equatorial ligands to fine -tune reactivity of high N. Sastry, S. P. de Visser, J. Phys. Chem. B 116 (2012 )718-730. [2]S. P. de Visser, L. Tahsini, W.

Cys 2His 2(C2H2) zinc finger is a typical DNA binding motif and can also binds to RNA. The motif possesses tandem repeats of zinc binding module which contains two pairs of conserved Cys and His residues and forms a compact \u00df -\u00df-structure (Fig.1) and is known to be quite abundant in human genome. Because of their unique features, we have been intrigued by versatility of these motifs and have been searching a novel role for them, especially protein interaction. One of these fu nctions is nuclear localization signal (NLS). Bidirectional traffic between the cytoplasm and the nucleus is routed through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) embedded in the nuclear envelope. Nuclear import of globular proteins greater than ca. 60 kDa in size requires a suitable NLS. Classical NLS consists of one or two short basic clusters. Nuclear transport of a classical NLS -containing protein is mediated by a ternary complex with importins and\u00df. Most of classical NLS can be recognized by an adaptor protein importin , whereas a few NLS is the target of importin \u00df. Sp1 is a ubiquitous transcription factor involved in the early develo pment of an organism. The prote in comprises three tandem repeats of C2H2 zinc finger motif at its carboxyl terminus, which binds to a GC -rich element of DNA (GC box)(1) and activates reasonably large subset of mammalian genes containing GC box upstream promoter elements. Like other nuclear proteins, Sp1 is supposed t o be actively transported into the nucleus due to its molecular mass (95 kDa). We identified that three C2H2 zinc fingers can serve as a 'bona fide' NLS of Sp1 [2,3] .Then, we analyzed several factors affecting nuclear localization. Overall tertiary struc ture formed by zinc binding as well as basic amino acids dispersed in the entire zinc finger region was required for its complete NLS function. Solid -phase binding assay indicated that Sp1 zinc fingers can directly interact with at least one oftransport f actors . A series of basic amino acids in zinc finger region play pivotal role for specific DNA recognition. Those may also contribute to the interaction with transport protein because classic NLS has one or two basic clusters important for importin binding . Then, we tried to use GC box DNA as a probe to evaluate comprehensively the role for basic amino acids dispersed in the entire zinc finger region on interaction with transport factors. Furthermore, interaction of Sp1 zinc finger with importins was elucid ated by biophysical method. The mode of protein interaction via the zinc finger domain will be discussed. References: [1]J.

Enzymes provide high turnover and specificity. In contrast, synthetic catalysts afford access to reactions not found in nature with high substrate scope. Artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) are created by anchoring a synthetic catalyst within a protein. [1]By their nature, ArMs offer the opportunity to create catalysts that combine the advantages of both enzymes and synthetic catalysts .[2,3] Here, we report the creation of an ArM for metathesis by fusion of a ruthenium catalyst to a new protein scaffold. Through directed evolution, we show that the catalytic turnover of the ArM can be improved drastically . We propose that the close proximity of the ruthenium and the scaffold surface allows for the dramatic effects observed in dir ected evolution.

The hydroquinone dioxygenases (HQDOs) are members of a large family of non -heme Fe(II)- containing enzymes that catalyze the oxidative cleavage of an aromatic ring, of which the catechol extradiol dioxygenases are by far the best known and best studied. Like the catechol extradiol dioxygenases, the HQDOs are found in two unrelated structural classes, Type I and Type II, yet share the same 2 -His-1-Glu facial capping triad. The enzyme PcpA, from Sphingobium chlorophenolicum L-1,is a Type I HQDO and is structurally related to the major cl ass of extradiol catechol dioxygenases. We have shown that is hydroquinones fluoro- ) substituents greatly preferred at the ortho positions, and that ring cleavage occ urs between the OH and ortho substituent. [1]Several lines of evidence indicate that halogen polarizability is a major factor that determines the specificity of this enzyme. Substrate binding titrations show only a small shift in p Kabetween the free vs. e nzyme -bound substrate, suggesting that PcpA lacks an active site base needed to deprotonate the substrate, which is a key difference from the structurally homologous Type II HQD O and displays a completely different pattern of substrate specificity, showing a preference for unsubstituted and monosubstituted hydroquinones, and a different ring cleavage regiospecificity. This points to important differences in the second coordinatio n sphere that define how the hydroquinone substrate binds and is set up to be attacked by dioxygen.

Spectroscopic data including structure determination with NMR spectroscopy showed that E c-1 is a two -domain protein that coordinates up to six Zn (II) ions cysteine and histidine ligands [2-4]. However, NMR spectroscopy is only able to give ind irect information about metal ion coordination, and this information is based on experiments using 113Cd nucleus to mimic Zn(II) ions, additional structural data from crystallography is highly desirable. Since previous trials to crystalize the full-length protein and separated domains ( and E) were not successful, we present here our first attempts with carrier -driven crystallization. In this approach, a crystallization chaperone such as glutathione s -transferase (GST) or the maltose -binding protein (MBP) can provide additional surface area to promote crystal contact formation [ 5].We obtained several crystals of fusion -proteins that could bring complementary information of the E c-1 architecture to understand its biological functions.

TheH118A variant required four times more hydrogen peroxide for c onversion of coproheme th an the wildtype. The reaction was also found to be about 20 fold slower than that of the wildtype.

Kanamycin A, from Streptomyces Kanamyceticus is one of the most important representatives of aminoglycoside antibiotics with a strong anti -bacterial effect against gram negative bacteria, used as a second -generation drug against tuberculosis. The mechanism of kanamycin biosynthesis is unknown, however bas ed on biochemical studies and mutational biosynthesis it was possible to isolate proteins that enter the synthetic pathway [1,2,3]. In our study, we highlighted the first step of biosynthesis kanamycin by using the KanJ enzyme belonging to the 2 -ketogluta rate depend dioxygenases from a new group of proteins involved in antibiotic biosynthesis. We have expressed recombinant KanJ in Escherichia coli, and optimized the purification of active protein. Thermofluor Shift Assays were used to screen for condition s that facilitate protein crystallization.

Biochemical measureme nts were carried out in three different pHs: 6.3 ,7.5 and 8.2 in buffers with different ionic strength.

Previously, we developed and reported a protocol to build and simulate CYPs in a phospholipid bilayer .1-2 Here, we have developed a transferable multiresolution computational approach to build and simulate a full length CYP -CPR -membrane complex using Brownian dynamics and all -atom molecular dynamics simulations. Application of this approach yielded multiple arrangements of CPR around CYP that are electron transfer (ET) competent. The modelled complexes allow identification of contacting residues in CYP1A1 - CPR and CYP17A1 -CPR complexes and the determinants of electron transfer rates ,which agree well with available experimental data.3-8 References [1]G.

The active site in a [NiFe] -hydrogenase consists of a dinuclear NiFe cluster (Figure 1), in which a Fe atom binds two cyanide (CN) molecules and one carbon monoxide (CO) as intrinsi c ligands. In the maturation of the [NiFe] hydrogenase, Fe(CN) 2CO unit is biosynthesized and subunit of the [NiFe] hydrogenase. CN ligand is produced from carbamoyl phosphate by HypE and HypF protein complex. Although the detail mechanism of biosynthesis and assemble of CN ligand has been elucidated, that of CO ligand remains unknown. HypX was recently identified as the enzyme responsible for CO biosynthesis during the maturation of [NiFe] hyd rogenase. Here, we report the structural analysis of the novel enzyme HypX and discuss the reaction mechanism of HypX . We determined the crystal structure of HypX from Aquifex aeolicus (Figure 2). HypX consists of the N- and C -terminal domains linked by a loop with the C -terminal tail. A continuous cavity connecting the two domains is present in the interior of HypX. The N -terminal domain of HypX has a structural homology to the -formyl -THF. In the crystal structure of HypX soaked with THF, THF is bound in the corresponding position in FDH -h. The structure and sequence comparison of HypX indicates the case of FDH -h. The C -terminal domain of HypX has a structural homology to enoyl -CoA hydratase/isomerase using the CoA derivatives as analysis of HypX variants , MD simu lation and native MS analyses reveal that CoA is constitutively bound in the C -terminal region of the cavity and that CoA can change the conformation in the cavity. Taken together, we propose the reaction mechanism of CO biosynthesis by HypX, in which the internal CoA mediates the conversion of the formyl -group in N10 -formyl -THF to CO. Figure 1.

The machiner iesareclassified into three groups (NIF, ISC and SUF) inwhich the mechanism of Fe -S cluster assembly differ sfrom other . However, the sinorganic sulfur (S0) from L -cysteine for sulfur - mobilization through a mechanism involving traditional PLP chemistry and C -S bond cleavage [2].It is proposed that th e substrate L -cysteine is bound to PLP and attacked by a catalytically essential cysteine residue for generation of S0via C-S bond cleavage. The generated S0is stored on the cysteine residue as a persulfide ( Cys-SS-), and transferred to sulfur- acceptor protein s.Despite the critical role of the catalytic cysteine residue, the local structure of the cysteine -containing region saredifferent between type I (NifS and IscS) and type II (SufS) cysteine desulfurases .For understanding the mechanistic difference in detail, the catalytic intermediates of the desulfur izing reactions of NifS and SufS were investigated crystallography .In both NifS and SufS ,aPLP-L-cysteine adduct was captured as an intermediate that is stabilized byelectrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding to arginine (Arg) and histidine (His) , respectively, at the PLP site , thereby defining the orientation of the substrate suitable for nucleophilic attack by the catalytically essential cysteine residue. Howeve r, the catalytic mechanism is between and SufS after PLP catalytic cysteine residue moves only slightly with arotation of the side chain. By contrast, the local structure containing the catalytic cysteine residue of NifS undergoes a large conformational change via secondary structural dynamics , allowing the cysteine to move over 23.5 \u00c5. This mechanistic difference should be inversely associated with the conformational flexibility of the partner proteins (SufU or NifU) that accept the sulfur Dean DR.

On the other hand , excess intracellular iron can generate reactive oxygen species, leading to organ dysfunctions such as cancer. Therefore, iron homeostasis is essential for cells. Cellular iron level is regulated by iron itself and iron-protopor phyrin IX complex , heme . Typical \"heme -regulated\" proteins, iron regulatory proteins (IRP s) and iron response regulator ( Irr), have a short consensus sequence containing Cys -Pro, the heme regulatory motif (HRM) . Recently, many HRM containing proteins not directly related to cellular iron homeostasis have been identified, suggesting that heme can function as a global signalling molecule for various kinds of biological processes. Cold shock protein (Csp) from a pathogenic bacterium, Vibrio cholerae , is one of such HRM containing proteins, function ing as RNA chaperones to stabil ize RNA structures in cellular adaptation at temperature changes . Among four but the heme binding to the HRM in CspD has not yet been confirmed and functional significance of the heme binding to CspD is unclear . Here , we examined the heme binding properties of V. cholerae CspD and its functional significance in the RNA chaperone . To clarify the signalling function of heme for CspD, we follow ed the effects of the heme binding on the target RNA binding to CspD by the f luorescence quenching of Trp near the RNA binding site , and a single strand DNA (ssDNA) was used as a stable model substrate for the target RNA . By the addition of ssDNA, t he fluorescence intensity at 340 nm was decreas ed (Fig. 1: closed circle ), indicating that CspD binds to ssDNA . On the other hand, such a decrease in the fluorescence intensity was not observed by the addition of ssDNA in the presence of heme (Fig. 1: open circle) , suggesting that heme inhibits the ssDNA binding to CspD. To determine to CspD , spectrophotometric heme titration was performed. O ne equivalent of heme was found to b ind to CspD and the Soret peak of the heme -CspD complex appeared at 417 nm, corresponding to a Cys/His coordination . We mutated Cys22 in the HRM of CspD to identify the heme ligand, but the Cys22 mut ated CspD (Cys22Ala) was able to bind one equivalent of heme with lower affinity than that of the wild-type protein. In the presence of heme, however, the fluorescence intensity at 340 nm of the C ys22Ala mutant was diminished by adding ssDNA (Fig. 1 : open diamo nd), showing that the heme binding to the C ys22Ala mutant did not inhibit the ss DNA binding . The heme binding at Cys22 is , therefore, essential for inhibition of the target RNA binding in CspD, and the mu tation at Cys 22 resulted in the shift of the heme ligand from Cys22 to other amino acid residue. Inhibition of the formation of the CspD -ssDNA complex by the heme binding to Cys22 is supported by the crystal structure of N. meningitides Csp showing 60% identity with V. cholerae CspD. Based on the heme environmental structure of N. meningitides Csp (Fig. 1: right) , Cys22 of V. cholerae CspD would be positioned close to the RNA binding site (Phe20 ) and the heme binding at Cys22 would sterically interfere the target RNA binding. Thus, we can propose that CspD us es heme as a signal ling molecule and Cys22 is the heme binding site to inhibit the target RNA binding .

In general, P450BM3 catalyzes the -chain fatty acids while it is inactive for small non -native substrates. In our previous research, we have successfully altered the substrate specificity of P450BM3 by using natur al-substrate analogs, which we call 'decoy molecules ,' and achieved hydroxylation of unnatural substrates such as benzene, cyclohexane, propane, etc. without any mutagenesis [2]. This P450BM3/decoy system is also useful for stereoselective hydroxylation of small organic substrates and we have succeeded in controlling the stereoselectivity of products hydroxylated by wild-type P450BM3 only by changing decoy molecules [3]. Herein we accomplished the heme substitution of P450BM3 with artificial metal -complex es, to modify its catalytic activity [4]. As a conventional method, acid/organic solvent has been used to remove the heme from target hemoproteins. However, this method is not applicable to every CYPs, and P450BM3 is irreversibly denatured under the condition prohibiting the reconstitution with artificial complexes. In our laboratory, a mild heme substitution method was developed by utilizing Fe -limiting medium, and we successfully reconstituted hem oproteins with artificial metal -complexes [5]. Howev er, even this mild method was not applicable to full- length BM3, due to its structural complexity. We focused on transpeptidase Sortase A from Staphylococcus aureus which recogni zes of full -length BM3 by ligating its heme domain with thereductase domain.

Perutz Laboratories, University of Vienna, 1030 Vienna, Austria . X-ray crystallography is one of the main resources to obtain information on the coordination of molecules within the active site of metallo proteins on an atomistic level. Based on ligand coordination, interatomic distances and relative positioning of catalytic amino acids e nzymologists try to understand the underlying electronic reaction mechanism. Therefore the exact redox status and conformation of the cofactor in question is of utmost importance. Unfortunately the redox active nature of metal cofactors makes them especially susceptible to irradiation induced photoreduction , making structural information obtained by photo -reducing X -ray sources the least trustworthy [1,2] . Here we present a study of the pre -steady state reduction kinetics of X -ray induced photo -reduction of six different model heme proteins to identify a reasonable dose -limit for the collection of non -reduced datasets for redox -active metallo enzymes. Using online we examine the reduction kinetics of six heme proteins in order to understand the impact of sample -derived variables (protei n, crystallization conditions, crystal morphology, and cofactor ) and irradiation -derived variables (dose and dose rate). Our results clearly show that the reduction kinetics solely depend on the dose, irrespective of the sample -derived variables. We can th erefore define a protein -independent dose -limit of 25 kGy , which corresponds to a 50% reduction of the desired initial redox state. Furthermore we can present a method of data collection and processing that allows for the collection of time -resolved low do se structures using standard macromolecular crystallography tools. Finally we present structures of a model heme protein (KpDyP) in different defined redox states. These structures show photoreduction induced rearrangements in water coordination and confor mation of the catalytically relevant residue Asp 143 [3]. The observed effects of photo -reduction highlight that care has to be taken when in -solution data of ferric proteins are rationalized by structural constraints derived from crystal structures of red uced enzymes.

Human LINE -1 retrotransposons are genetic elements responsible for an increase of human genome variability. The ORF1p sequence is one of the two open reading frames that encodes highly conserved N - terminal trimeric coiled coil domain proteins that connect to a central RNA recognition motif. The three - stranded coiled coil (3SCC) region utilizes a heptad repeat where hydrophobes occupy in a and d positions. Cysteine residues are found to locate in three different layers (one in a dposition and two in a positions), making these thiolate -sites potential to bind heavy metals in an MS 3geometry due to the enthalpically strong M -S bond. Though the structural details of heavy metals bound to the ORF1p have not been recognized, here we employ de novo 3SCC peptides, GRAND -CS, to understand how leads bind into a 3SCC. Structurally characterized from the dual tri- thiolate sites in the (GRAND -CSL16CL23C) 3 crystal structure, both Pb(II) centers simultaneously adopt a trigonal pyramidal geometry with an endo conformation, where the metal is located b elow the cysteine plane and downward to the C -termini. The Pb(II )-S bond lengths are within 2.57 - 2.62 \u00c5, depending on the sites and the conformers of cysteine ligands. The binding of Pb(II) in the d site is demonstrated from the Pb(II)(CSL12C) 3structure . Similar to the a sites Pb(II) binds in a trigonal pyramidal geometry with an endo conform ation ( average Pb(II)- S distance = 2.60 \u00c5); however, the metal is surprisingly located above the thiol plane (toward the N -termini of the 3SCC). Further analysis wit h the apo -peptides has shown that the a sites are preorganized, while the dsite is predisposed for the metal complexation. Based on these crystallographic observations using the designed peptides, we provide a potential model for the unrecognized Pb(II) binding sites that could happen in the 3SCC region of the ORF1p encoded proteins.

There are many reports that heme protein functions have been enhanced by substituting heme for its analogues that are modified with functional groups and/or replaced for metals other than iron. However, high bulky metal complexes compared with heme generally cannot be incorporated into native heme proteins, since the heme binding site is suitable for the accommodation of heme molecule. Recently, we have reported that the heme protein HasA can accommodate various artificial metal complexes that are totally different structures from heme. HasA is a heme -acquisition protein secreted by a certain type of pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, under iron deficiency conditions. After acquiring heme from its hosts, HasA transfers the heme to the HasA -specific receptor, HasR as an iron source for its survival. HasA captures heme using its two loops with coordination of His32 and Tyr75 to the h eme iron (Figure1a).The hem e- binding position is highly exposed to solvent, thereby the moiety of the captured haem can be seen from outside of HasA in the crystal structure of HasA incorporating h eme(Holo -HasA). This unique heme - binding fusion allows the incorporation of synthetic metal complexes with structures different from heme such as iron -salophen, iron -phthalocyanine, and iron- diphenylporphyrin .[1][2]The crystal structures of HasA incorporating metal complexes revealed that HasA can bind these metal complexes in the same binding fashion as that of heme wit hout any structural perturbation suggesting that a wide variety of the metal complexes would be accommodated by HasA. In this study, we demonstrated that a native h emeprotein HasA can accommodate metallo - tetraphenylporphycenes (Figure. 1b) with bulky substituents, while their structures are significantly different from h eme. We also have succeeded in crystal structure analysis of HasA capturing cobalt(III)- 9,10,19,20- tetraphenylporphycene (Co -Ph4Pc). The X -ray crystal structure analysis of HasA with Co - Ph4Pc revealed that HasA can accommodate Co- Ph4Pc in its heme -binding position by locating four bulky phenyl groups on Co -Ph4Pc at the outside of HasA. Additionally, we found that HasA -loops forming the heme -binding pocket possess satisfactory flexibility. The appropriate structural changes of its loops allowed incorporation of bulky phenyl groups on metallo- Ph4Pcs into HasA. Figure Y. Miyake, H. Shinokubo, Y. Int. Ed. 129(2017) 15481 -15485.

Their cysteine residues have a high affinity toward metal ions preferably with d10 electron configuration, such as ZnII, CdII, and CuI.Metal ions are bound in characteristic thermodynamically stable metal- thiolate clusters which are the predominant elements of their tertiary structure.1,2 Plant MTs are far from being investigated inte nsively, and there is scarce information about their structural and functional aspects. Our main focus is set on the investigation of structural characteristics of the plant MT2 protein (cicMT2) from chickpea ( Cicer its cen tral Cys - free linker region. However, it is obvious that this central region has a significant impact on the structure of plant MTs in comparison to members of the other families. cicMT2 is a typical member of the plant MT2 subgroup featuring an N -terminal Cys -rich region with eight Cys residues and a C -terminal region with six, separated by a 41 amino acids long Cys -devoid linker region. The binding of five divalent metal ions to protein thiolate groups leads to the formation of a single metal -thiolate cluster .3So far, approaches to determine the structure of the full -length protein both with crys tallographic methods and NMR spectroscopy were not successful due to its flexible nature. Hence, we focus our attempts on the evaluation of the secondary structural elements, their specific localization, and their stabilization by metal ions, as well as th einfluence of plant MT-specific linker region on the overall stability of the protein.

This catalytic function turns Cldsinto a highly interesting enzyme for bioremediation , since this harmful anthropogenic compound is a serious environmental concern and increasing concentrations of chlorite have been detected in soil, ground -and drinking water. Furthermore it is very interesting f rom a biochemical point of view ,as it is the only known enzyme system which efficiently catalyses the formation of a covalent O=O bond, beside the water -splitting manganese complex of photosystem II. Functional Clds (i.e. chlorite degrading Clds) can be divided into two phylogenetically distinct clades, 1 and 2, which differ in subunit size, stability and oligomerisation. Clade 1 mainly consists of hexameric or pentameric proteins, whereas dimeric Clds appear in clade 2 [2 ]. It was shown that several functional Clds possess a flexible arginine in a more or less hydrophobic distal heme pocket that can adopt two distinct conformations. Either it is pointing towards the substrate entry channel (\"out\") or towards the heme iron (\"in\") [3 ]. Furthermore, the X -ray crystal reveals that there is a glutamine residue that acts as hydrogen bonding partner and thereby putatively stabilizes the out - conformation of the catalytically important distal arginin e [4]. This dismutase CCld and the role of the distal in the heme pocket with respect to chlorite reactivity and accessibility of the active site. We replaced the distal Gln74 by valine to mimic the active site architecture of NdCld. Here, we show the latest experimental results comparing kinetic data of wild type CCld and the variant Gln74Val.

The development of target -selective photosensitizers is sought to accomplish the efficient and selective photosterilization of serious pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whilst reducing damage done to surrounding tissue s.To select ively deliver pho tosensitizers to P. aeruginosa, we focused on the heme acquisition system (Has) of P. aeruginosa, which permits the scavenging of extracellular heme as an iron source. Under iron -limiting conditions, P.aeruginosa secretes the heme acquisition protein HasA (apo-HasA). Apo -HasA pirates extracellular heme from its of HasA (holo- HasA). Heme is then delivered to the HasA -specific outer membrane receptor HasR. After formation of the high affinity holo -HasA- HasR ternary complex, heme is heme -free HasA (apo -HasA) from HasR ready for a further round of heme acquisition. We have previously demonstrated that HasA is rather promiscuous, capturing several synthe tic metal complexes other than heme, as iron phthalocyanine (FePc). HasA incorporating heme acquisition (IC 50approx. 24 nM), resulting in the suppression of P. aeruginosa growth [1]. W e reasoned that FePc -HasA may irreversibly interact with HasR, thus blocking further binding of holo -HasA and concomitant transfer of heme, essentially starving the bacteria of vital iron [1,2]. These findings support the hypothesis that the outer membrane receptor HasR possesses the ability to selectively accept photosensitizers captured by HasA, encouraging us to utilize the aforementioned -HasR interaction for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) . report the specific photosterilizatio n of can be used as a selective photosensitizer, enabling us to efficiently eliminate P. aeruginosa including multidrug -resistan t strains by irradiation with near -infrared (NIR) light irrespective of antibiotic -resistance type.

However, stability of LPMO has not been major focus of investigation considering its crucial role in industrial application [3]. Here, We have investigated the thermostability of an LPMO from Thermoascus auranti acus (TaLPMO9A). TaLPMO9A was found to retain most of its initial activity after incubating at 100 \u00b0C while its apparent melting temperature (Tm) is 69 \u00b0C at neutral pH. Uniquely, our studies show that TaLPMO9A can fold back to its original conformation wi th an intact copper site upon lowering the temperature. The thermal unfolding and refolding of TaLPMO9A was measured spectroscopically utilizing the two -state model and detailed thermodynamic parameters were obtained for the holoTaLPMO. ESI -MS analysis of TaLPMO9A revealed that the enzyme is glycosylated in its native form and the the rmostability of the deglycosylat ed form was also investigated. Activity of the TaLPMO was studied by an optimized. Amplex\u00ae Red assay as well as by TaLPMO9A catalysed oxidation of phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC). These studies confirm the functional regain of TaLPMO9A activity upon going through one cycle of unfolding and refolding. References [1] R. J. Quinlan, M. D. Sweeney, L. Lo Leggio, H. Otten, J. C. N.

Conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides is an essential biochemical reaction in all living organisms that use DNA as their genetic material. Under aerobic conditions, class I Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) proteins perform this complex reaction via a di -metal cofactor that undergoes oxygen activation to generate and stabilize a radical critical for catalysis. Different subclasses of RNRs ranging from Ia to Id rely on specific combinations of Fe and/or Mn ions to gen erate a tyrosine radical or a radical -equivalent high valent metal center. A di -metal site was believed to be an absolute requirement for function across all known class I aerobic RNRs [1]. In this study we describe a new subclass of class I RNR, class Ie , that by modifying a tyrosine amino acid into a 3,4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), overcomes the explicit requirement of a di -metal cofactor for radical generation and stabilization. Studies using X EPR and in -vitro assays describe this metal independent radical species and the new RNR subclass [2]. A metal -independent RNR could possibly impart an evolutionary advantage to pathogens residing under metal limiting conditions e .g. induced by the immune system. Further characterization of the mechanisms for covalent modification and radical generation are ongoing.

The most intriguing differences are associated with the o xygen -binding site, with type II EgtB's having a completely different configuration of active site residues that are involved in oxygen binding and activation. Two mobile active site loops that appear to fold in a substrate dependent manner replace the rigid active site observed in other types. These two active site loops play a dynamic role in catalysis.

Le Brun1 -S) proteins unique to Actinobacteria, a phylum of Gram -positive bacteria that includes medically important patho gens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and soil bacteria belonging to the Streptomyces genus, the source of over half of all clinically useful antibiotics. Wbl proteins are important for the ability of M. tuberculosis to persist in an antibiotic resistan t state in the host for prolonged periods of time, and for sporulation in Streptomyces species. Mutagenesis studies of the four conserved cysteines which coordinate the Fe -S cluster show them to be crucial for Wbl protein function. Furthermore, at least so me Wbl proteins appear to be sensors of nitric oxide (NO), and WhiD from Streptomyces coelicolor and WhiB1 from M. tuberculosis have been previously shown to undergo a rapid, complex reaction with NO, reaching completion after the sequential addition of 8 NO molecules per cluster. This appears to give rise to a mixture of protein -bound iron- nitrosyl complexes with similarities iron- nitrosyls [1,2] . The mechanisms by which Wbl proteins function have yet to be clearly de monstrated. They appear to act as transcriptional regulators, but in some cases at least this occurs via an interaction with another protein. For example, in S. coelicolor, the WhiB regulon has been shown to be identical to that of the WhiA protein (a regu lator required for sporulation), indicating that the proteins cooperate to effect transcriptional control [3]. WhiA is not itself an Fe -S cluster protein, it is nevertheless unusual in that it has an N terminal domain related to a class of homing endonucleases, but lacks the residues required for catalysis. The link between Wbl proteins and a number of sigma factors has also been documented, the implications of these interactions is currently unknown. The aim of this work is to gain insight into the Wbl pro teins from S. venezuelae, in terms of both their reaction with NO and interactions with potential partner proteins, and the mechanisms for signal transduction. To do this, both non- denaturing and LC -MS methodologies are being employed alongside more traditional bioanalytical and spectroscopic approaches. References [1]Kudhair, BK et al (2017) Nat.

Besides the fact that Caenorhabditis elegans is an excellent model organism itself, it is highly suitable to study globin function because its genome consist sof 34 globin genes, which are all expressed throu ghout different cell type s[1]. One of them is GLB -33 that is mainly expressed in the neuronal tissues of the nematode and from homology modeling it is suggested to consist of a 7 - helical transmembrane domain and a heme -containing globin domain (GLB -33GD). The first is similar to a P he- Met-Arg-Phe-amide neuropeptide receptor whereas the latter is a myoglobin -type molecule. Interestingly, GLB -33GD shows faster nitrite than any other reported globi n [2] . Here, we use the combination of optical, vibrational and electro n paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to reveal that nitrite does not easily bind the ferric heme iron since it remains strongly hydroxo ligated. Mildly acidic conditions were needed to obtain maximal nitrite coordination and the effect of acidity on GLB -33GD and on the GLB we conclude from with 14/15NO 2-and mass spectrometry that nitrovinyl heme is formed at low pH-values via the substitution of a vinyl p roton with NO 2. Distal amino acids in the vicinity of the heme play a major role in the stabilization of small ligands and more specifically in the binding mode of nitrite in hemeproteins [3]. The distal side of the GLB -33GD consists of an exceptio nal hydrophobic pocket including the following crucial amino acids linked to globin function: Leu-41(CD3), Ile -69(E7), Arg -72(E10), and Ile -73(E11). this set, only Arg- 72 is capable of ligand stabilization and Ile -69 is responsible for pentacoordinat ion of the iron in the reduced state. In order to study nitrite stabilization and the catalytic roles played by the lack of a distal His -69 residue in GLB - 33GD, Arg -72-Val Ile -69-His mutants are under References [1]Hoogewijs D, De Henau S, Dewilde S, Moens S, Desmet UQ 8) is a redox active lipid that plays a crucial role in the mitochond rial electron transport chain. The aerobic UQ 8 biosynthesis pathway in E. coli requires at least twelve ubi genes, most of them encode enzymes that decorate the aromatic ring of 4 -hydroxybenzoate ( 4-HB) 1, 2, 3 , 4. The three aerobic hydroxylases Ubi I, UbiH and Ubi F , C1 and hydroxylation steps, are all O2 and FAD -dependent monooxygenases 4. Thus they are not involved in the anaerobic UQ 8 biosynthesis pathway 5. In E. coli , the yhbU (renamed ubiU ) gene is located next to yhbV (renamed ubiV) gene, all two being likely to constitute an operon, and they appear to be important for the biosynthesis of UQ 8 in the absence of oxygen, as the knock -outs of these genes abolish the UQ 8 content in E. coli in anoxic conditions. Here, we report for the first time the detailed biochemical and biophysical properties of UbiU and UbiV from E. coli and demonstrate the important role of four conserved cysteine resid ues that each protein possesses. UV-visible absorption spectra of aerobically purified UbiV show the presence of a [2Fe-2S] cluster, whereas the ele ctron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of anaerobically reconstituted protein show the pr esence of a [4Fe -4S] cluster. Next we show that UbiU and UbiV form a heterodimer complex and the EPR spectra of anaerobically reconstituted complex show the pres ence of two [4Fe -4S] clusters w hose environments are not identical. Although reconst itution of [4Fe -4S] cluster in UbiU alone was unsuccessful, we are able to show that UbiU carries the second [4Fe -4S] cluster through studies of the UbiU -V complex .

The Wood- Ljungdahl pathway is native to a diverse range of anaerobic microbes for incorporating CO 2 into acetyl -CoA, where it becomes energy or material in the cell [1]. A linchpin enzyme within this pathway is acetyl -CoA synthase (ACS), of an enzyme pair containing CO dehydrogenase (CODH). CODH reduces CO 2 to CO, which travels through a tunnel to ACS, where CO condenses with CoA and a methyl group donated by corrinoid iron -sulfur protein (CFeS P) into acetyl -CoA [1,2] . A previous study probing CO binding to ACS indicated the presence of a n alcove keeping CO near the ACS A -cluster active site, which composed of an unusual di -nickel center proximal to an [Fe 4-S4] cluster [3]. At the A -cluster, the proximal Ni (Ni p) is the site of CO, met hyl, and CoA binding, and forms a bridge between the [Fe 4-S4] cluster and the distal Ni (Ni d) [1,2] . Crystallographic studies of CODH/ACS under high pressures of Xenon further identified a gas -binding site, or hydrophobic \"box\" at the edge of the CO channel near Nip [2]. To understand the alcove's role in CO binding, a key residue forming a wall of the alcove, phenylalanine 229 (F229), was mutated to alanine (F229A), effectively removing the alcove's structure, and to a tryptophan (F229W). Using numerous spectroscopic techniques, including IR, EPR, and X AS, the alanine variant's ability to bind CO is significantly altered, while the ability to methylate is not. This disrupted CO binding is evident through significant EPR shifts, absent Ni-CO XAS , and lack of a characteristic Ni-CO infrared band at 1995 cm-1 [3,4] . The F229A variant's disturbed ability for carbonylation seems to be solely due to the missing phenylalanine 229 residue , which appears uniquely crucial to binding and maintaining CO near the ACS active site while leaving methylation at levels and rates similar to those of the wildtype. We propose the alcove plays an essential role in the ACS mechanism by binding and retaining CO near Nip to facilitate formation of the key Ni p(I)-CO, methyl -Ni and acetyl pathway of acetyl -CoA synthesis. which is further supported by a biomimetic A -cluster model's ability to bind CO and methylate in the Ni p(I), while as -isolated ACS in the Ni p (II) state cannot [5,6] .

Clavaminic acid synthase an dependent -lactamase reactions, i.e. cyclisation and desaturation, lead to formation of the clavam nucleus and proceed in a single binding cavity of CAS [2]. The aim of this QM/MM study is to elucidate the factors that determine hy droxylation/desaturation selectivity and to explain how the versatility of the reaction selectivity is achieved. For both the native substrates of the enzyme, i.e. deoxyguanidinoproclavaminate (DGPC) and dihydroclavaminate (DHC), the difference between the strength of the C -O bond (formed during radical rebound) and the O -H bond (formed during desaturation) favours the hydroxylation reaction as demonstrated with use of valence bond theory [3]. For the former substrate (DHC), the interactions with the binding cavity of CAS compensate for the electronic properties of the reactants and alter the selectivity towards desaturation. The QM/MM results indicate that the key to enzyme versatility might be the residues that interact with the charged terminal group of t he substrate (guanidine group of DGPC and amine group of DHC) and thus impose such a position of the substrate that facilitates hydroxylation in case of DGPC and desaturation for DHC.

Fibril- forming collagens play crucial roles in maintaining the integrity of tissues and organs, where triple -helical molecules of the fibril- forming collagens have intrinsic propensi ty to self -assemble with forming well -ordered fibrils. In the fibril, 300 - nm long collagen molecules are placed parallel to one another with a regular staggering of one- fourth of the molecular length, and then the collagen fibrils further form thick fibres . However, the complete mechanism of this well -organized self -assembly has not been elucidated [1]. Excessive deposition of collagen fibres in tissues and organs causes fibrotic diseases such as liver cirrhosis, pulmonary and renal fibrosis, keloid and scl eroderma. Therefore, inhibition of collagen over - production or excessive deposition is recognized as a promising mechanism for the research and development of antifibrotic agents. On the basis of the inhibition of collagen fibril- formation, an anti - telopep tide monoclonal antibody has been developed for treatment of keloid [2]. However, small - molecule candidates with low molecular weights have not been discovered to date. Recently, cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin ), a well -known anticancer agent, a potential inhibitor of collagen fibril -formation, using an in vitro random screening of small -molecule compounds [3]. Because the inhibitory effect was found only in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) solution o f cisplatin, the active species were suggested to be cisplatin derivatives formed in the DMSO solution. Then, mass spectrometry of cisplatin derivatives formed in DMSO was analysed , indicating that the active compound is identified to be [Pt(NH 3)2(Cl)(DMSO )]+ [4]. In this study, the foregoing results motivate us to investigate and explore the biological transition metal ions and complexes with potent inhibiting activity against the formation of collagen fibrils, obtained by reduction of Cu2+ with ascorbic acid. We monitored the degree of fibril -formation of porcine atelocollagen in phosphate buffered saline measuring the increase of absorbance due to turbidity at 313 nm using Infinite\u00ae200PRO plate reader at 37\u00baC [3]. The ratio of fibril- formation was calculated from the difference in absorbance from 5 to 120 min, and the 50% inhibitory concentration s (IC 50) of metal ion s were estimated from the inhibition -titration curves . Additionally, the triple -helical conformation structure of collagen molecules was confirmed by measuring the specific CD spectra of positive cotton effects at 225 nm. From the results, o nly Cu1+, Cu2+ and Au3+ were found to inhibit the formation of collagen fibrils in vitro in the metal concentration -dependent manner without affecting the triple -helical conformation of the collagen molecules. While, o ther metal ions had little or no effects on the fibril -formation of collagen. Cu2+ and Au3+ were further revealed to interact with specific sites on the collagen triple helix by competition assay using the mixed solution of metal ion and each amino acid such as Gly, His, Arg, Lys, Glu, As p, Hyp, and Met , and the binding sites of Cu2+ and Au3+ were suggested to contain His and Met residues, respectively. Interestingly, Au3+-Met mixture exhibited stronger inhibition against the fibril -formation of collagen than Au3+ ion in the complex concentration -dependent manner , which was speculated to occur by the counter effect of Au3+ due to coordination with lone-pair electrons of R-S-CH 3 group . These results for transition metal ions and complexes in this study will be useful for both investigating molecular mechanisms of collagen self- assembly and drug development for the treatment of fibrotic diseases with lower toxicity than cisplatin.

The heme - domain of P450BM3 is fused to the reductase -domain. Such a unique structure enables efficient electron transfer from NADPH to heme cofactor, resulting in high catalytic activity. Despite its advantageous catalytic activity, P450BM3 does not cataly ze hydroxylation of n on-native substrates such as benzene because binding of long chain fatty acid is essential for activation of P450BM3 and generation of reactive species, Compound I . Recently, our research group reported that hydroxylation of non- native substrates is cataly zed by P450BM3 in the presence of a series of perfluorocarboxylic aci d(PFCs)[1][2].We named these functional molecules \"Decoy molecules\" are substrates by P450BM3 and activate P450BM3 because they bind to P450B3 in a similar manner to native substrates .However, decoy molecules themselves are not hydroxylated because of shortage of chain length therefore various non-natural substrates are hydroxylated instead[3].The structure of decoy molecule shas been improved to achieve more efficient activation of P450BM3 andthelatest study demonstrated that a variety of amino acid derivatives serves as decoy molecule s[4].

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and the major cause of dementia throughout the world that makes it one of the biggest challeng es of the 21st century in public health. The prevalence of this disease is expected to increase rapidly in the coming decades. Although the mechanisms underlying this complex pathology are not yet fully understood, a broad consensus attributes the early development of AD to a so called amyloid cascade. This deleterious process relies on the disturbed equilibrium between the production of a peptide called amyloid - (A ) and its degradation by other proteases. This results in a significant increase in extracellular concentration, leading to its aggregation via the formation of oligomers, protofibrils and fibrils.[ 1] These assemblages come together to form amyloid plaques, a distinctive post -mortem marker of the disease. Different forms of A peptides are found in the senile plaques, such as the \"full -length\" A 1-40/42 peptide and the N -truncated peptides A n-40/42 (pos. 1- 11).[ 2-5] Strong evidences have associated the high toxicity of Cu -containing aggregates to their ability to promote the oxidative stress observed in AD via the catalytic production o f reactive oxygen species (ROS).[6 -7] A lot have been done regarding the studies of the ROS production with the full length A peptide,[ 8] nevertheless N-truncated forms which are little considered are of interest because it's thought that there are present in huge quantity in th e brain and senile plaques.[ 3, 9] Moreover it's admitted that they possess a protective effect against ROS production thank to their ATCUN (Amino -Terminal Copper and Nickel binding) type coordination site. Fig. 1: Proposed coordination sites (major form) of a) CuIIA1-n, b) CuIIA4-n and CuIIA11-n and c) CuIA1/4/11- n. Indeed, the coordination site of the N -truncated peptides is different from the one found in A 1-40/42 (Figure1) which confers them different properties regarding the ROS production.[ 10] Here we present the results of the study of the ROS production obtained with two N -terminal A isoforms found in the brain: A 4-n and A 11-n. This study aims to clarify/investigate the following points: (i) the ROS production of CuII/IA4/11-16 in our experimental conditions, and (ii) the effect of the presence of A 4/11-n on the ROS production by CuII/IA1-16.

Multiple pathogenic elements , including reactive oxygen species (ROS) ,amyloid -(A) peptides , and transition metal ions, are implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) [1,2].In addition, these pathological elements show their inter -connections which can aggravate the progression of AD[1-3]. For instance, r edox -active transition metal ions can interact with A to form metal -bound A (metalA)that can overproduce ROS [1-4]. Therefore, the regulat ion of these multiple factors using multifunctional molecules is an effective approach towards attenuation of AD pathology [ 2].In this presentation, we will report arational strategy of designing small molecules with multi -reactivity towards free radicals, metal -free A,and metalA.

Copper is essential for life and a faulty cellular copper homeostasis has been associated with the development of Parkinson's disease. In vitro studies have shown that even at physiological concentration copper may accelerate th e rate of S aggregation.1Therefore, it has been proposed that misregulation of copper can lead to the aggregation of the protein -synuclein which causes cellular damage in neurons.2 Here we report the synthesis and characterization of a novel BODIPY based near -infrared fluorescent copper(I) probe. This probe has good photophysical properties for cellular imaging due to a selective 4- fold fluorescent turn- ON response to Cu(I) ( =0.65)over other metal ions. It shows an absorption peak at 647 nm, a fluorescent emission at 66 1 nm. This new probe (as well as a previously reported one3) has been used to study the co localization of copper(I) and -synuclein in N27 and SH -SY5Y cell s.

According to Alzheimer Disease International, every 3.2 seconds one new case is adding worldwide. However, no molecular level understanding of pathogenesis has been established, and there is neither cure nor reliable methods for early diagnosis. Oxidative stress coupled with metal -ion dyshomeostasis is of major mechanistic and physiological significance due to its direct involvement in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative stress [1,2] .Oxidation products of the -amyloid (A) peptide, as well as metal -ions, are found in the senile plaques that are hallmarks of AD, leading to the hypothesis that redox -active metal ions may constitute a key element in the disease etiology [ 3]. We hypothesize that common pathogenesis exists for familial and sporadic AD, both de pending on the chemical (amino acid mutations or oxidation, respectively) modification of A. In this study we report a \"controlled metal- ion catalyzed oxidation [4]\" to probe early molecular events related to oxidatively induced damages to A\u00df16 wild- type, and two have examined time-dependent events using Cu2+/AscH-/A\u00df resulting in mild extents of oxidation. We show that within 15 minutes of oxidative reaction, ~ 95% of parent peptides are oxidized. ESI-MS ana lyses showed distinct oxidized A\u00df species under mild oxidation within 3 minutes. LC/MS analysis demonstrated that the copper -coordinating histidine residues as a major target cleavage, oxidative cleavage, and oxidative decarboxylation, as well as up to 3 oxygen atoms adducts with parent peptides, were also identified as the products of Cu2+/AscH-oxidation.

Amyloid -(A)peptides are proposed to be involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For the greater control of A -involved pathology in AD, the regulation of both Aclearance and metal -Acomplexation would be valuable. In this presentation, we will report a new series of small molecules able to achieve the tu nability of modulatory activities against acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) and Zn(II)- bound A[Zn(II)- A], two pathological targets found in the brain affected by AD . Rational tuning of the hydrophobicity and Zn(II) binding affinity of the 1,10 -phenanthroline ( phen ) framework successfully yielded modulators for ASM (4 and5), Zn(II)- A(phen, 1, and 2 ), or both ( 3).Our overall approaches and findings will show promise for rationally engineering simple and small molecules as chemical modulators for single or dual pathological features (especially, metalloenzymes or metal- related amyloidogenic peptides) implicated in n eurodegenerative diseases [1].

Ruthenium and Gallium have been two promising metals after Pt in successful development of metal based anticancer drugs. Among the ruthenium complexes tetrahedral organometallic half sandwiched RuII-p-cymene complexes are widely studied because of the structural flexibility that allows development of metal complexes by tuning the bidentate ligands, arenes and halides [1,2] .The recent advances show theuse of tubulin binding agents to Ru and Pt complexes to make them efficient inhibitor of tubulin polymerization [3,4]. However, ligands can be designed such that the overall complex itself inhibits tubulin polymerization. Microtubules, which are dynamic polymers of -tubulin, play an essential role in mitosis, forming the dynamic spindle apparatus. Disruption of micr otubule dynamics prevents microtubule function that ultimately leads to cell death thus making them efficient target for anticancer drugs . We designed a ligand keeping in mind the aromatic trimethoxy motif in co lchicine (a microtubule polymerization inhibitor )tosuppress the dynamics of the mitotic spindle leading to arrest in mitotic phase and cell death. W e synthesized four N -O coordinating RuIIcomplexes, (1-4) bearing formula [RuII(p- cym)(L)Cl], that have the affinity to bind at the tubulin active site that could distort or inhibit microtubule polymerization .All the complexes showed in vitro antiproliferative activity ( IC50range 10 -20 \u00b5M) against various cancer cells including the difficult to treat triple negative human metastatic breast adenocarcino ma (MDA -MB-231). The ESI -MS and 1H NMR data shows that the complexes are stable in aqueous solution at pH 7.4 (4 mM NaCl) with less than 10% hydrolysis for at least 24 h. The immunofluorescence studies show that the c omplexes inhibit tubulin polymerization at IC 50dose in the metastatic MDA -MB-231 cells and induce apoptosis by arresting the cell cycle in G2/M phase.

Recently, cobalt complexes have gained increased attention as promising alternatives in comparison to platinum -based drugs ,which often result in severe si de effects .From a chemical and physical point of view cobalt, similar to platinum, adopts a wide variety of coordination numbers, geometries, oxidation states, and ligand binding affinities, which has led to an interest in cobalt chemistry in the pursuit of alternative anticancer agents. Interestingly, cobalt(III) complexes exhibit different mode of action than platinum(IV) prodrugs .A relativel y inert oxidised cobalt(III) state is to very labile cobalt(II) facilitating exchange of axial ligands. Binding of the c omplexes to important histidine residues in active sites of proteins cause irreversibly inhibition of activity .Cobalt(III) complexes inhibit histidine - containing proteins and enzymes including zinc finger transcription factors (TFs) and metalloendopeptida ses[1,2]. In this work, promising Co(III) complexes were coupled to cell penetrating peptides in order to increase the cytotoxic potential (See figure) .The Schiff base ligand H 2salophen was used for complexation to CoCl 2\u00b76H 2O under nitrogen. In the next step, six -coordinate Co(III) complexes were synthesized with imidazole, 2 -methyimidazole and N- Boc-L-histidine methyl ester in axial HPLC. The Co(III) complexes were conjugated three different cell peptides: FFFF, RRRRRRRRRGAL and FFFFRRRRRRRRRGAL.

Coupling of N -terminal peptides with the cobalt complexes, possessing carboxylic group Schiff base ligand, afforded by analytical HPLC, ESI -MS and MALDI. The anticancer activity of the synthesized compounds was studied against different human tumor cell lines: lung cancer A549, liver cancer HepG2 and normal human fibroblasts GM5657T, in comparison with the activity of cisplatin as a reference drug.

Here, we describe a novel approach for attaching an OH containing drug ( in this case via the 5' -OH of gemcitabine ) to the axial position of Pt(IV) via a carbonate linkage. S hortly after reduction of the Pt(IV) complex ,the carbonate linkage is cl eaved from the complex followed by rapid loss of CO 2 (decarboxylation) generat ingthe active drug (scheme 1) .

The inhibition both cyclooxygenase isoenzymes ( COX -1 and COX -2)is assumed as probable mode of action. However, the selective inhibition of COX -2 is aimed because itplays a significant role in carcinogenesis, while COX -1mainly regulates homeostatic functions [2]. With th e objective of generating COX -2-selective compounds, the approach to introduce a fluorine substituent within the aromatic moiety of Co -ASS was followed as a frequently applied strategy in medicinal chemistry [3]. Moreover, it was intended to exploit the fluorination for the purpose of bioanalytical labeling. The influence of the fluorine substituent on the cytotoxic and the antimetabolic properties against colon (HT -29) and breast cancer cell lines (MDA -MB-231, MCF -7)was determined. The inhibition of both cellular and isolated COX as wel l as the induction of the apoptosis -related caspases 3/7 were evaluated. Additionally, cellular uptake studies were conducted based on the sequential analysis of both cobalt and fluorine performing high- resolution continuum -source atomic respectively molecular absorption spectrometry (HR CS AAS / MAS). The compounds exhibited a remarkably less activity in the COX -1/2-negative MCF -7 cell line ,while they reduced the cell biomass in the COX -1/2-positive HT -29 and MDA -MB-231 cells in the low and showed a concentration -dependent antimetabolic activity. Fluorination effected a preferential inhibition of COX -2 compared to Co- ASS. Furthermore, it was demonstrated in cellular uptake studies that an about 5 -fold higher bioanalytical sensitivity (HR CS MAS technique) can be achieved when using fluorine as tracer instead of cobalt. Fluorinated cobalt alkyne complexes derived from Co -ASS were synthesized and characterized as promising antitumor active agents. The outcomes confirm that the interaction with the COX cascade can be assumed as mode of action andfluorination shifted the selectivity towards COX -2.Moreover, the measurement of fluorine using HR CS MAS was proved as a highly sensitive method for the quantification of fluorinate d cobalt complexes in biological samples.

Cancer has been the second cause of death in the world for men and women. [1] The best -known anticancer metallodrug is Cisplatin, a planar Pt2+complex approved by the FDA in 1978.

[2] Copper has become an alternative to complexes of platinum and platinum group metals as anticancer drugs .[3,4,5]This versatile biometal has borderline Lewis acid properties [6] and therefore can bind to different donor atoms forming complexes with diverse coordination numbers and geometries , and distinct redox properties . Two copper complexes based on phenanthroline and histidine containing ligands were synthetized and mass spectrometry, electrochemistry and DFT calculations). [7] These complexes have high stability in aqueous solution and are redox active (Cu2+/Cu+). DNA cleave studies indicate low redox based nuclease activity and cytotoxic studies using MCF7 and A2780 cancer cell lines reveal moderate IC 50values. To further understand their properties and optimize the systems, uptake studies and production of reactive oxygen species inside the cancer cells were carried out.

Biotin has been conjugated to drugs as a strategy to provide selective delivery tocancer cell [2]. Previously, our lab prepared a new ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complex with dual action, an enhanced singlet oxygen production along with strong DNA binding [3]. These properties were achieved by combining an anthracenyl -pendant bipyridine ligand and to improve activity against bacteria and cancer cells, we further incorporate biotin to a bipyridine ligand, compound was fully characterized and its photophysical and electrochemical properties investigated. Photophysical studies showed that u pon excitation, the complex exhi bited ametal -to-ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) emission at 631 nm with quantum yield of 0.07 in acetonitrile .Interestingly, this compound exhibited a quantum yield for singlet oxygen production of 0.75, along with very high DNA binding (LogK b= 6.80) ,supporting biotin incorporation was not deleterious .This photochemical behavior could be ascribed to the lower triplet state involving the anthracenyl -modified bipyridine associated to an easier oxygen quenching. Moreover, this complex showed a high lipop hilicity (log P = 1.32), which is close to the range assumed for oral and intestinal absorption. Altogether, these results make this complex as a promising cytotoxic agent. [1]Monro , S., C. G., and McFarland S. A., Chem. Rev. 119 (2019), 797 -828. [2]Maiti, S., Paira, P., Eur. J. Med.

These macrocycles are involved in a cooperative capture approach used for the development of rotaxanes (mechanically interlocked molecules ) in a one -pot reaction strategy.[1] Taking advantage of the ability of catalyse the azide- alkyne cycloaddition (CB -AAC) [2], we aim to develop an efficient and modular synthetic tool for thesynthesis oftargeted non-covalently bound radiotracers. For our purpose, the advantage of adding -CD is two -fold: (i)-CD acts as aco-catalyst in the CB -AAC by forming a hydrogen bonding network with two adjacent CB[6] rings that accelerates the cycloaddition step, [1] and (ii)-CD can be derivatised to introduce a targeting vector, such as the prostate membrane specific antigen (PSMA) binding motif , Gly -NH-C(O) -NH-Lys.Using this strategy, ,non-covalently bound targeted radiotracer inhigh radiochemical yield and purity.

A recent WHO report reveals an alarming degree of resistance of common bacteria against antibiotics, which also includes \"last resort\" antibiotics. This could lead to some life -threatening diseases, caused by infections of e.g. K. pneumonia, becoming incurable.1In addition to raising awareness of the proper use of these pharmaceuticals and prevention of (hospital -acquired) infections, the development of new antimicrobial and antibiotic agent is inevitable to solve this problem. In this project the search for new antibacterial agents i s approached by catalyt ic conversion in or on cells. T he cell membrane was chosen as themain target with phospholipids as substrates. C is-unsaturated fatty acids contribute to the flu idity of the cell membrane, which holds important enzymes e.g. of the respiratory chain. T hese double bonds were chosen for modification reactions with the intention to promote a disruption of the fluidity and therefore a loss of vital enzymes.2In olefin metathesis the residues of a double bond undergo an exchange reaction with a metallocyclobutane intermediate. When this reaction is performed on double bonds in lipids, a shortened lipid dimer would be formed, that will have a reduced mobility compared to the substrate . A major advantage of this reaction is, that it can be p erformed at moderate temperatures and in different solvents by a series of Ru -based catalysts (Grubbs -type HGII ) is the most suitable catalyst for biological application due to its water and oxygen stability as well as its high activity.3The catal ystwill be modified at its NHC ligand to wit h a membrane peptide (RW RWRW ) that is selective to bacteria.4We have been able to prove the activity o fHGII on se veral phospholipids in methanol in inert atmosphere. On the poster, we will discuss various metathesis experiments both on lipids in general andonliposomes . These studies are performed on a molecular level in terms of substrate conversion as well as a macroscopic level regarding the size of the liposome and the fluidity of the membrane.

Medicinal inorganic chemistry has made a great effort in designing new synthetic agents for the treatment of diseases such as cancer, taking advantage of the diverse geometries and coordination numbers of metals and the wide range of available ligands. [1] Helicates have shown interesting structural properties for DNA modification, due to their cationic charge and intrinsic ch irality . The \"topological\" character that the recognition phenomena between helicate and DNA has, is based on the establishment of specific non -covalent interactions.[2] However, most of the helical complexes already reported are racemic, and they can be s eparated into their enantiomers by difficult processes. Chiral ligands having at least one optically active center, make possible the formation of enantiopure and stable or helicates. [3] In this work, we present the synthesis of enantiopure Ru(II) helicates, M-[Ru 2(LSS)2]4+and chirality of the enantiomers on the affinity to bind DNA was s tudied using canonical B -DNA and non -canonical 3WJ DNA. Differences in the int eraction mode between the enantiomers and DNA were studied by gel electrophoresis, UV-vis., NMR, molecular dynamics, T -melting, CD and LD. The junction of those techniques is clear to show the enantioselective character in the binding phenomena. Consequently, the M -enantiomer hasastronger affinity forDNA ,compared to the P -enantiomer .To verify if enantioselectivity has an impact on the cellular viability, the helicates were tested on four cancer cell lines by the MTT assay : A2780, SK -OV-3 (ovarian), MD -MBA -231 and MIA -PACA -2 (pancreas). Consistently, the M-[Ru 2(LSS)2]4+helicate showed the highest inhibitory effect on ovarian canc er cells, according to results of ROS induction and cell cycle by flow cytometry. 988. [2]J. Malina, M.

However, as up to now, the mechanism of actions (MoAs) of AuRF has not been clearly realized. In the present study, we employed an optimized subcellular fractionation (SCF) and vehicle- treated cancer cells.

The nuclear sub- proteomes obtained by SCF were subjected to transcriptional regulators (TRs) analysis; while the merged global proteome data were used for KeyNode -mediated pathway analysis [4] by using bioinformatics tools to help understanding the MoAs of AuRF.

The most common positron emitter is 18F due to its good radiochemical properties accessibility. The most utiliz ed fluorinated agent is 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose. Despite its almost universal usethere is an effort to prepare new labelled antibodies. These substances have the prior position among 18F radiotracers, however, their preparation is often quite laborious and time consuming. The time required for tracer production reduces the specific activity of the administered sample. In recent years attention is focused on attachment of fluorine to the vector through high- energy bonds, such as Si-F, B-F orAl-F.In our research we concentrate on compounds with Zr -F bond. [1][2][3] In order to increase the efficiency of radiolabelling and radiochemical yield we study the behaviour of zirconium with unsaturated coordination sphere .

Bariatric surgery is an effective medical treatment to achieve weight loss in obese patients. The most common procedure is a Roux -en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) ,in which the duodenum and upper intestine are bypassed. Malnutrition often occurs af ter bariatric surgery due to a reduced intake and malabsorption. In this study, we assessed the isotopic compositions of Cu,Fe, and Zn in the serum and whole blood of obese patients who underwent RYGB .Premenopausal female patients ( body mass index (BMI) 40 kg/m2)who underwent a laparoscopic RYGB were selected . Samples were collected before surgery and at 3, 6,and 12 months post -surgery. The Cu isotopic composition was lighter in the post-surgery serum and whole blood samples compared to thecorresponding pre-surgery samples .The difference between the Zn isotopic composition in serum and that in whole blood was larger after surgery. Acorrelation between Fe isotopic composition and glycae mic parameters was established . To conclude, the altered metal homeostasis in post-bariatric surgery patients is reflected in changes in the isotopic compositions of Cu, Fe, and Zn ,even one year after the surgery.544 545 ICBIC-19 ICBIC-19 Poster Presentations Metals in MedicinePoster Presentations Metals in Medicine Book of Abstracts Book of AbstractsP249 A Ru(II) Polypyridyl Complex Bearing Aldehyde Functions as a V ersatile Synthetic P recursor Chemistry for Life and Health Sciences, Laboratory for Inorganic Chemical Biology, 75005 Paris, France. 2Department of Chemistry, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 190, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland. 3Chimie ParisTech, PSL University, CNRS, Institute of Chemistry for Life and Health Sciences, Theoretical Chemistry and Modelling, 75005 Paris, France. 4Please note the new address: Department of Chemical Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Colaba, Mumbai 400005, India. aThese authors have contributed equally to the work.

However, these complexes also show significant negative side effects, such as neurotoxicity, renal toxicity, and hepatotoxicity. These facts support further research of platinum -based complexes with less severe adverse effects. We focused on two platinum(II) oxalato complexes [Pt(ox)(L 1)2] (1) and [Pt(ox)(L 2)2] and its derivative (L2) as N- donor ligands and showed up to 7 -times higher in vitro cytotoxic ity than cisplatin [2-4]. With respect to the above -described features of the studied complexes, we decided to study their anticancer activities and mechanisms more deeply, evaluating their cellular and molecular effects against the selected cancer cells, and by the in vivo studies to elucidate their antitumor activity on the mice bearing the L1210 lymphocytic leukaemia. The effect s of complexes ( 1) and ( 2) on the cell cycle were evaluated on h uman A2780 and MCF7 cell lines . Complex ( 1) increased G2/M cell cycle phase population by ca 1.5 -times in both cell lines , but complex ( 2) did not affect cell cycle. On the other hand, cisplatin showed apparent increase of sub -G1 cell population. The further analysis revealed that complex ( 2) had similar ratio between apoptosis an d necrosis as cisplatin. Complex ( 1) induced preferentially apoptosis than necrosis . Positive results from in vitro experiments prompted us to test both complexes further in vivo . The best result was observed for complex ( 1), which prolonged mean survival time of mice, whereas cisplatin and complex ( 2) shortened it. However, cisplatin dramatic ally decrease d the body weight (in average up to 30 % of the initial body weight) ; this effect was not observed for both the tested complexes. Complexes ( 1) and ( 2) also caused less severe side effects, such as total systemic failure, apathy, loss of appetite , cirrhosis, and colon endothelial damage , than cisplatin. Both tested complexes activated caspase -3 more effectively than cisplatin thus confirming that they preferentially induced apoptosis than necrosis. The o btained results indicated that the shown platinum(II) oxalato complexes represent promising cancer therapeutics with less severe side effects than cisplatin revealing different mechanism of action.

This not only overcomes the main disadvantages of the FM dyes but also presents t he opportunity to employ correlative and electron microscopy -alkyne cycloaddition .Their rhenium complexes are only weakly emissi ve when excited at 405 nm - the wavelength commonly used in confocal microscopy ; however, to overcome this limitation, a series of substituted pyta ligands were synthesised with the aim of tuningthe excitation (and emission) wavelength of theirRe(I) complexes. In addition to alteration of the photophysical properties, the inclusion of these functional groups also provides a synthetic handle for conjugation to a drug molecule for targeted therapy or photoswitchable moiety. The inclusion of ligands with structural similarities to that of the FM dyes should therefore mimic theirlipophilicity and amphiphilic nature .Naturally occurring amines are water -soluble, and closely resemble the hydrophilic head of FM dyes ;they also carry the distinct advan tage of facile incorporation into the pyta .Further modification of the complex can be achieved through synthetic manipulation of the monodentate ancillary ligands to introduce hydrophobic character.

To survive, fungal pathogens acquire nutrients from their environment to support basic biological processes. These nutrients include transition metals like copper and iron, but due to their redox activity, these metals can become toxic if misappropriated. The host immune system exploits this delicate balance by manipulating metal availability at the host -pathogen interface. In turn, pathogens have developed mechanisms for tolerating metal starvation or excess and are well -equipped to survive th ese harsh territories. We posited that when faced with antifungal drug stress, a pathogen's access to essential metals could impact its ability to survive. In this work, we describe how metal availability impacts the response of fungal pathogen Candida albicans to treatment with the antifungal drug fluconazole, a mainstay in antifungal therapy. Overall, we establish that fluconazole both affects and is affected by cellular Cu machinery, and that the availability of Cu in the growth environment further modul ates these effects, resulting in metal -mediated outcomes of drug treatment. 548 549 ICBIC-19 ICBIC-19 Poster Presentations Metals in MedicinePoster Presentations Metals in Medicine Book of Abstracts Book of AbstractsP254 Replacement of Equatorial Chlorides of Satraplatin by Acetates etsch2,3,Petra Heffeter2,Dan Gibson1 1Institute for Drug Research, School of Pharmacy, The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, 91120, Israel . 2Institute of Cancer Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Borschkegasse 8a, 1090 Vienna, Austria. 3Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemis try University of Vienna, Waehringerstrasse, Vienna, 1090, Austria. The platinum (Pt) -based cancer chemotherapy became popular after the landmark discovery by the Rosenberg and his co -workers [1]. The three FDA -approved Pt(II) drugs cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin are still helping cancer patients worldwide in eradication of the disease. Serious side effects [2] and acquired drug resistances [3] are two of the major drawbacks of treatment associated with cisplatin. These drawbacks encouraged extensiv e efforts to design platinum drugs with improved therapeutic outputs. At the moment, one of the most popular approaches to overcome these problems is to prepare octahedral Pt(IV) derivatives of the square planar Pt(II) drugs to minimize side effect, increase activity and moreover to make orally bioavailable. Recently, it is popular to conjugate bioactive ligands to the axial positions of to attain \"dual solubility in the equatorial chlorides by acetates can enhance solubility. It is evident from the recent literature that Pt(IV) complexes having fixed equatorial am(m)ines and axial ligands, equatorial acetates are more stable in aq ueous solution than chlorides [4]. Thus, we chose to prepare \"dual\" and \"triple action\" derivatives of satraplatin, the most successful Pt(IV) drug in clinical trials, where the chlorides were replaced by acetates, derivatives and studied the cytotoxicity and mode of action against several cancer cell lines. Our hypothesis is that there are two stages of activation for the Pt(IV) prodrugs; the first is the reduction to the Pt(II) complex and the second is the activation by aquation of the Pt(II). Since both stages occur inside the cancer cell, it may be advantageous to replace the chlorides with acetates that aquate rapidly and might be efficient DNA platinators.

In motivation f or finding new chemotherapeutics displaying selective toxicity for aggressive triple - negat ive breast cancer (TNBC) cells, t he effect of two, recently developed metal -based half sandwich complexes [Os(6-pcym)(bphen)(dca)]PF 6(Os-dca) and [Ru(6-pcym)(bphen )(dca)]PF cancer cells MDA -MB-231 was studied. The complexes show high and select ive toxicity in several tumor cells, and a prominent effect has been observed for Os -analogue . The lower potency of Ru- dca in comparison with Os -dca has been shown to be connected with a relatively quick release of dca ligand due to hydrolysis of Ru -dca before this complex enters the cells [1]. Remarkably, both Os -dca and Ru -dca reduced successfully metastases related properties of the triple -negative breast cancer cells such as migration, invasion, and re- adhesion. The anti -metastatic effects of Os -dca and Ru-dca have been found to be associated with their ability to suppress matrix metalloproteinase activity and/or production and reduce expression of aquaporins. Further studies reveal that Os-dca reverts Warburg's effect and oncosis seems to be a prominent mode of cell death that predominates over the apoptosis. As such, Os -dca can efficiently overcome the resistance of cancer cells to clinically used apoptotic inducers cisplatin and carboplatin. The cytostatic and anti -metastatic properties of Os -dca in MD A- MB-231 provide a strong impetus for the development of new metal -based compounds to target hardly treatable human TNBC cells and displaying different mode of action compared to the antitumor metallodrugs in clinical use [2].

Many cancer treatments involve platinum(II) -based drugs like cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin, which il licit their potency by binding covalently to DNA. The clinical use of these drugs is limited due to resistance and severe toxic side effects that are caused by reactions with off target molecules .[1,2] To address the selimitations, we have developed unconventional platinum(II) and platinum(IV) complexes, that exhibit a different mechanism of action to cisplatin and its analogues.[3] Platinum(IV) complexes are kinetically inert, reducing the possibility of reactions with extracellular biomolecules. These unconventional complexes are in th e form [Pt(P L)(A L)]2+(where P Lis a polyaromatic ligand and A Lis an ancillary ligand) and demonstrated significantly better cytotoxicity than cisplatin as indicated in the figure below .

Positron emission tomography (PET) is a molecular imaging technique that produces three- dimensional images in high resolution used to assist diagnosis and the monitoring of disease. Flourine -18 is a positron -emitting isotope (t1/2= 109.8 min) that is widely PET to radiolabel small molec ules. Conventional radiolabelling with fluorine -18involves the formation of covalent C -F bonds. The development of late stage fluorine -18radiolabelling using metal complexes has emerged as an exciting method to synthesise PET imaging agents.1,2As fluoride has a small ionic radius and high electronegativity, it binds strongly to group 13 metal ions such as Al3+and Ga3+(bond dissociation energies of Al -F and Ga -F are estimated at 665 and 557 kJ/mol respectively). C oordinate bond formation between Ga3+/Al3+and F-may lead to complexes of sufficient stab ility compared to covalent C -F bond formation for imaging application s. In this work, we explore the potential of Ga3+-F complexes as an alternative method for rapid incorporation of fluorine -18into molecules. Lipophilic and stable [18F]F--Ga3+complexes with the potential to cross the blood brain barrier could be used as brain perfusion imaging agents for PET to assist in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease . With the aim of synthesising charge neutral Ga3+-F complexes, pentadentate ligands were synthesised to to Ga3+. Fluorination of Ga3+complexes was achieved using KF. The formation of the Ga -F bond was confirmed by 19F{1H} NMR spectroscopic studies and single -crystal X -ray crystallography .In one example, t odevelop new methods for the incorporation of fluorine -18into Ga3+complex esthat bind to protein deposits associated with Alzheimer's a stilbene derivative conjugated to 1,4,7 - triazacyclononane -1,4-diacetic acid was coordinated to Ga3+.The binding properties of the compounds to extracellular -amyloid (A ) plaque sin human tissue was evaluated.

The important pr opert yof these PtIVprodrugs is that their antitumor action combines several different mechanisms owing to the presence of biologicall yactive axial ligands. Here we present some biological properties of a \"tripleaction\" prodrug that releases in cancer cells cisplatin actingmoieties, oc tanoate and phenylbutyrate [1], [2]. It is demonstrated, with the aid of modern methods of molecular and cellular biology and pharmacolog y, that the presence of three different functionalities in a single molecule of the PtIVprodrug results in high potency in tumor cells including those resistant to cisplatin [the IC 50values in the screened malignant cell lines ranged from as low as 9 nM (HCT -116) to 74 nM (MDA -MB231)]. It is demonstra ted that cellular activation of the PtIVprodr ug results in covalent modification of DNA through the release of the platinum moiet yaccompanied b yinhibition hy permethylation of DNA b yoctanoate. Thus, the PtIVprodrug acts as a true \"multiaction\" prodrug, which is over two orders of magnitude more active than clinically used cisplatin, in both 2D monolayer cultu re and 3D spheroid cancer cells [3].

Cellular b inding and blocking assays demonstrate d a degree of specificity of the Glu - NH-C(O) -NH-Lys containing constructs towards the PSMA expressing LNCaP cell line. Studies in athymic nude mice bearing subcutaneous LNCaP tumours found that functionalised GNFs have rapid blood pool clearance and renal excretion . Time-activity curves extracted from dynamic PET scans showed that circulation times could be extended via introduction of the addition of the albumin- binding tag. Modulation of the pharmacokinetic profile is encouraging evidence that the chemical and biological properties of functionalised GNFs can be tuned for use in theranostic drug development.

Through the advent of self-contained generators and favourable properties (t 1/2 = 68 minutes, decay via 89% positron emission) radioactive gallium has become widely available as a promising Positron Emission Tomography isotope for clinical use . Antibodies hold great promise for more specific diagnosis and therapy of disease. One challenge for labelling antibodies has been the availability of gallium specific chelators which can radiolabel und er mild conditions without requir ing elevated temperatures. This would allow the creation of kit -based systems wherein labelling is achieved through direct addition of generator eluate to a preformulated antibody -chelator construct. Here we report innovative gallium chelator, the 6-amino -1,4-diazepine triacetate (DATA) ligand that can form single -species complexes with 68Ga and b e quantitatively labelled at room temperature over a range of pH's .1 Through attachment of DATA to a single -chain antibody ( scFv ) targeting activated platelets, a thrombosis imaging agent can be implemented in a 1 -pot kit -based system. The recombinant scFv anti- GPIIbIII specifically binds to ligand induced binding sites on the integrin complex GPIIb/IIIa only when it is activated.2 Detecting activated platelets has wide utility as a diagnostic agent for thrombosis and inflammation. The DATA ligand was attached to the targeting agents using site -specific immobilisation via the Sortase A transpeptidase from Staphylococcus aureus . This ensures specific C -terminal post - translational modification without compromis ing the active site of the antibody.3 We attached the Sortase A substrate DATA- PEG 4-Gly 3 to the scFv anti-GPIIbIII and the non- binding control scFv Mut. Confirmation of successful conjugation and preserved binding was demonstrated by LC/MS and FACS . Next, SEC and radio -SEC with 68Ga was performed showing stability of the novel construct . The radiolabelling protocol led to successful radiolabelling of the [68Ga]Ga -DATA -scFv complexes in 5 minutes, at ambient temperature at pH 5. After purification , 95% radiochemical purity was achieved . References [1] B. Waldron, D. Parker, C. Burchardt D. S. Yufit, M. F. Roesch, Chem. Commun. 49 (6) 2013 579-581 [2] B. M Paterson, K.

Using RAW264.7 cells, we first screened the library of drugs which induced Toll -like receptor 4 (TLR4), a surface receptor that can init iate the production of pro -inflammatory cytokines. Results showed that among all complexes tested, cDDP and JM118 induced higher levels of TLR4 surface expression, leading to the higher production of pro- inflammatory cytokines like TNF -, IL-1, IL-6, and IL -12. cDDP later was chosen a main agent for further experiments due to its long history of clinical treatment. The level of PRAT4A protein, a chaperone that transport TLR4 to cell surface,[4]was also enhanced under treatment of cDDP, thus confirming the regulation of cDDP on TLR4 activation. The cDDP -treated macrophages showed a higher anti -cancer effect compared to control ones. Supernatants collected from activated cells were more toxic to L929 fibrosarcoma cells than controls. Results from macrophages -mediated cytotoxicity assay also indicated the killing superior of activated macrophages, about 10% higher than controls (where controls killed 70% of L929 cells). The difference is not big due to reduction of phagocytosis rate of RAW264.7 cells by cDDP , suggesting the killing ability of activated cells is mainly via cytokine secretion. Next, non -cell-to-cell-contact assay showed that the tumoricidal efficacy of activated cells was about 20% while one of controls was approximately 3 %. The activated macrophages induced more cancer cells arrested at G1 and more necrotic and apoptotic cells. Further experiments need to carried out to find out biological targets of cDDP .

Platinum(IV) carboxylate scaffolds have garnered considerable research interest as they can be engineered to function as prodrugs of clinical platinum(II) anticancer drugs. These platinum(IV) prodrug complexes are stable, tunable, and activated by reduction to release their cytotoxic platinum(II) cargo. Cisplatin is one of the most effective and wid ely used chemotherapeutic drug to treat various cancers but cisplatin treatment is limited by toxic side effects due to poor selectivity.1,2Here we propose new platinum(IV) prodrug complexes designed to release cisplatin via photoreduction upon UV irradia tion. The central to utilise aryl on the axial positions of the platinum(IV) scaffold as they confer significant UV absorption and would stabilise carboxyl radical formation, thus favouring homolytic Pt -O bond cleavage. We i solated and identified aryl carboxyl radicals via spin - trapping and showed that the photoreduced platinum species mirror cisplatin reactivity toward DNA bases, thereby validating the (6)quenched365R RR RR R Financial support by Singapore Ministry of Education and NUS Graduate School of Integrative Sciences and Engineering aregratefully acknowledged.

Pemetrexed ( 1) is a chemotherapeutic drug that acts as an anti -folate and is used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Since folate receptors, which can increase the uptake of both folates and anti - folates, are overexpressed in certain tumo urs, 1offers an interest ing starting point for the development of novel metal -based radiopharmaceuticals.1 Recently, our group developed a bifunctional c yclopentadiene,2which canreplace the phenyl ring in 1, and thereby generating the Pemetrexed mimic 2 .The Cyclopentadiene in the structure of 2 can act as a strong ligand for Re and99mTc. Compound 3in which the [Re(CO)3]+ moiety coordinates to the integrated cyclopentadienyl ring, has been synthesised and characterized.

However, the clinical trials involving curcumin is hurdled by its poor bioavailability. To tackle this issue, herein we present a novel series of cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes that incorporate the advantages of Ir(III) metal complexes with curcumin serving as light -activatable prodrugs. Current results indicated that the combination of curcumin with Ir(II) chaperone complexes was an effectiv e way in promoting bioavailability, and imparted the complexes with photo -induced curcumin release property. Intriguingly, the post -activation Ir(III) complexes were meanwhile endowed with photosensitizing capability. Thus, we can realize dual modes (chemo therapy and PDT) of cancer therapy by a photocage manner. Further evaluations on the photo -induced chemotherapy are in progress. We hope that by this study we can fully document the photo- activation mechanism and cytotoxicity profiles of the Ir(III) comple xes, and assess the potential of these complexes as prodrugs for cancer therapy.

G-quadruplexes (G4) are higher -order DNA and RNA structures which contribute to regulation of gene expression, telomeric maintenance and DNA replication.1G4 stabilisation leads to modulation of some oncogene s'transcription and inhibition of telomerase. Consequently, there is significant interest in developing small molecules which target and stabilise G4, and in doing so act as potential anticancer therapeutics.2,3To further explore the potential of G4 binder s both in vitro and in vivo we adapted G4 binders for use in a range of applications, such as imaging or targeting, using click chemistry. We report the synthesis and characterisation of novel nickel, zinc and platinum salphen complexes bearing \"clickable\" backbones. Phosphorescence properties of the for G4 -binding was evaluated using circular dichroism salphen complexes were functionalised with azide or trans -cyclooctene ( TCO )to \"click -on\" probes suitable for optical or nuclear imaging ( e.g.DOTA for radiometal labelling) or for specific targeting ( Fig.1 ).This general, modular strategy enables the production of different probes for multiple applications derived from a single precursor. By utilising this synthetic route we conserve the planar ligand system neces sary for G4 binding, as evaluated by various biophysical techniques. Thermal stabilisation of G4 and binding affinities for unmodified versus modified platinum(II) salphen complexes were similar indicating the presence of the clickable group did not impai r G4 DNA binding.

The reactivity has been controlled by engaging the lone pair on the nitrogen and development over the years has led to drugs like bendamustine and chlorambucil which are continued in clinic due to their ability to increase the life of a cancer patient in spite of the severe side effects of these drugs. Metal complexation is an efficient way to engage the lone pair on the nitrogen of the mustard responsible for the aziridine formation .[1]Metals like Co and Cu have shown promises in pre -clinical experiments. [2-3]However, the most successful metal in cli nic Pt(II) has been relatively less investigated in this regard in spite of the fact that 50% of cancer che motherapy in clinic involves a platinum drug ( viz. cispl atin, oxaliplatin, carboplatin) either in combination or as standalone. [4]The clinical Pt- drugs also suffer from dose limiting side effects and resistance towards chemotherapy. The platinum drugs and nitrogen mustards are DNA cross -linking agents and hence their combination may lead to increase in steric hindrance at the Pt site thus reducing deactivation by glutathione or prevent pre -mature hydrolysis . In our attempt to generate a stable complex andstudy the effect of complexing a nitrogen mustard with platinum(II) we previously made a bis(2 -chloroethyl)pyridylmethylamine bound cis-dichloroplatinum(II) complex (1)which wasfound to be more active than cisplatin in human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) and human -7) However, 1isalso cytotoxic to normal cells .[5] Motivated by the desire to design a more stable but active Pt -mustard complex we have made two more Pt(II) mustard complex esusing 1as a precursor . Among them the oxalate bound 'oxamusplatin'( 3) (Figure) is7 times more toxic towards cells (DU145 , IC 50= 20.51 \u00b5M )and18 times more toxic to the hormone sensitive breast cancer cell line (MCF -7, IC \u00b5M ). The accumulation of the complex is similar to cisplatin inside cancer cells as per the ICP -MS data and it strongly resists binding to glutathione at pH 7.4 even when 15 molar equivalent ex cess glutathione is used.

The growth of multidrug- resistant bacterial strains to the existing antibiotics is a global case of concern . Tuberculosis (TB) which is caused b y the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis , is the most lethal of all infectious diseases [ 1]and the cases of extensively drug resistant -TB have called attention of the World Health Organization . Anthranilic acid derivatives are known since the 1950's for inhibiting the tryptophan synthesis pathway in bacteria [2]. It is suggested that the mechanism of inhibition occur by counter -selection of genes that codify proteins responsible for the conversion of anthra nilic acid in tryptophan [3]. Fluoroanthranilic acid isomers are active against theM. tuberculosis variant capable of forming biofilm s, with minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) of 19.4 mg/L, activities isoniazid (MIC > 256 mg/L), streptomycin ( MIC = 125 mg/L) and a mikacin (MIC = 1000 mg/L) against the same strain are much lower [2]. Silver compounds have also been considered in the synthesis of antibacterial agents due to the remarkable activities of silver ions. One of the best examples is silver sulfadiazine, which is widely used for the treatment of skin burns and wounds. In this case, sulfadiazine slowly releases silver ions, which are responsible for the antibacterial acti vity[4]. In the present work we describe the synthesis of a new silver(I) complex with 4 -fluoroanthranilic acid (Ag-4fa)and its antibacterial activities over Gram -positive and Gram -negative bacterial strains . The complex was synthesized by the reaction o f an aqueous solution of AgNO 3(0.60 mmol) with the potassium salt of 4fa (0.60 mmol) in ethanol under stirring . After 2 hours, the w hite solid formed was collected by filtration and washed with water . The yield was 92%. Elemental analysis suggests a 1:1 metal:ligand composition. Infrared and NMR spectroscopic analyses indicate coordination of the ligand to silver(I) by the nitrogen atom of the amine group and the oxygen of the carboxylate moiety. The silver(I) complex showed antibacterial activities with MIC = 62.25 mg/L against four strains the ligand alone did not show activity under the same experimental conditions .Preliminary b iophysical assays were performed to assign possible biomolecular targets for the Ag -4fa complex. A garose gel electrophoresis assay ssuggest that DNA is not a target for this compound.

In order to o vercome the problems associated with the lack of selectivity of anticancer drugs, inert cobalt(III) complexes may provide a remarkable platform as they are capable of being selectively reduced under the hypoxic conditions of cancer cells. Drug molecules which are released from the less stable and much more labile Co(II) complex may selectively act only in the tumo ur [1]. Our previous research has shown, how the functionalization of the 2 O donors and modifications of various tripodal 4N donors influence t he redox properties of mixed ligand Co(III) complexes [2]. Based on these results we have used tris(2 -methylpyridyl)amine (tpa) and tris(2 -aminoethyl)amine (tren) as one of the building blocks of ternary complexes in our recent experiments [3]. For drug mo lecules, anthracyclines could be a good choice. Many compounds bearing this scaffold (e.g. doxorubucin) have antitumor properties and are also used in cancer chemo therapy. Their aromatic moiety can intercalat e between the DNA base pairs , however their antitumor action is mainly attributed to topoisomerase -II inhibition . The efficacy of t hese drugs are limited by their side effects, they m aycause ch romosomal damage [4]. In our work hydroxy were selected, because the 1,4 (quinizarin) and its 2 -sulphonate derivative (quinizarin -2-sulphonate) are the simplest molecules, which represent the basic structure of anth racyclines. Our hypothesis was that, the ternary complexes would be able to in crease the selectivity and decrease the side effects. To explore this field novel [ (Co(III)(4N) )2(OO)]n+type complexes have been designed, synthesized and characterized, incorporating quinizarin and sodium quinizarin -2-sulphonate. This contribution will summarize th e results obtained in solution by various (NMR, IR, CV) methods on the novel Co(III) complexes. The lipophilicity and binding ability of free ligands and their complexes to human serum albumin (HSA) were also studied to predict their pharmacokinetic properties .

Palladium has received much attention as an alternative to platinum in the development of metallodrugs. The palladium(II) ion shares many properties with platinum(II), since both have the d8 electronic configuration and adopt square planar geometry. S everal research groups have focused on the evaluation of the biological properties of palladium (II)complexes of the type PdX 2L2as potential anti - cancer agents [1]. In m edicinal inorganic c hemistry, Schiff bases have been considered due their anti- inflammatory, analgesic, antimicrobial, anticonvulsant, anticancer and Schiff base metallodrugs have also beeninvestigated in the ment of new anticancer and antimicrobial chemotherap eutics [3].The aim of this work was the synthesis and characterization of a new palladium (II) complex with a Schiff base and the evaluation of its biological activities. The selected Schiff base was prepared by the reaction of the 4 -(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonamide ( L1-NH 2) with 2 - pyridinecarboxaldehyde, resulting in the L1 -pyligand. The sulfonamide (L1-NH 2)was chosen due to its specific carbonic anhydrase IX inhibit ion activity [4]. Elemental analysis of the complex indicate sthe composition C14H15Cl2N3O2PdS.The crystal structure of the palladium(II) complex confirmed the formation of the chelate of the L1 -pyligand to palladium (II) by the imine and pyridyl nitrogen atoms. Spectroscopic measurements showed that the complex does not undergo lig and replacement in solution even after 24 hours. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy indicates alterations on the secondary structure of calf -thymus DNA after incubation with the pa lladium (II) complex, which is consistent with coordination of the nucleobases to the metal centre. Competitive fluorescence displacement experiment with ethidium bromide resulted in quenching of the fluorescence after titration with the complex. This quenching is in accordance with ethidium bromide displacement after the alterations in secondary structure of DNA verified by CD . The cytotoxicity of the complex was evaluated over the MDA -MB-231 cell line. The cell morphology after treatment with the compound indicate loss of cell integrity and presence of cellular debris , along with hamper ing of proliferation .

The development of hypoxia -activated prodrugs is important for cancer treatment, since hypoxic cancer cells are resistant to conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In hypoxic cancer cell, there is a reductive atmosphere. So far, bioreductive Co(III) complexes can be used for prodrug toward hypoxic regions. Some Co(III) complexes undergo bioreduction to the more labile Co(II) species by ubiquitous one-electron reductase in cells. In hypoxic cells, the labile Co(II) complexes dissociate to release its bioactive ligands, and the high toxic ligands can induce apoptosis of cancer cells. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report about cytotoxicity of Co(II) species which have released their ligands. Therefore, we have focused on Co(III) investigated cytotoxicities against of the all Co complexes arewithin -0.4 V, and these are enough of reduction potentials in hypoxia tumor. The cytotoxicities of these complexes against HeLa cells were investigated by MTT assay. The cytotoxicities of the all complexes in hypoxia condition were higher than those in aerobic condition. However, [Co(bpy) 2(CO 3)]Cl and [Co(phen) 2(CO 3)]Cl have strong cytotoxicities in aerobic condition compared with other Co(III) complexes, because of their low reduction potential. [Co(mephen) 2(CO 3)]Cl has the highest selectivity for hypoxia tumor of these complexes. In addition, these Co(III) complexes ha velow cytotoxicities against human normal cells (MRC -5). In order to investigate the chemical species of these Co(III) complexes in the reductive solution, we measured UV -vis.and ESI -MS spectra of these Co(III) complexes with ascorbic acid. The UV -vis. spectral changes and ESI -MS spectra of carbonate Co(III) complexes suggested that the carbonate ions disassociated from the Co(III) complexes. However, the UV -vis.and ESI spectra of the Co(III) complexes having acac ligands suggested the acac-ligands dissociated from Co(III) complexes. The reaction rate of [Co(mephen) 2(CO 3)]Cl was higher than those of the Co(III) complexes having acac ligands. These result s selectivity of [Co(mephen) 2(CO 3)]Cl was due to both appropriate redox potential and high reactivity with ascorbic acid, and this Co(III) complex was expected asthe efficient anti -hypoxia drug.

Here, we show that synergistic toxic action in cancer cells of combinations of antitumor platinum drug carboplatin and effective PARP inhibitor olaparib is considerably improved if these combined drugs are encapsulated into liposomes. Notably, the formation of such nano - formulations, called OLICARB, leads to a marked enhancement of activity in human cancer cell lines (including those resistant to conventional platinum antitumor drugs) and selectivity towards tumor cells. We used immunofluorescence analysis of H2AX expression and examined DNA damage in cancerous cells treated with the investigated compounds. We find that the synergistic toxic effects in cancer cells of both drugs used in combination, nonencapsulated or embedded in the OLICARB nanoparticles, positively correlates with DNA damage. These results also suggest that the enhancement of the toxic effects of carboplatin by olaparib in cancer cells is a consequence of an accumulation of cytotoxic lesions in DNA due to the inhibition of repa ir of platinated DNA augmented by the synergistic action of olaparib as an effective PARP inhibitor. Our findings also reveal that the combination of olaparib with carboplatin encapsulated in the OLICARB nanoparticles is particularly effective to inhibit t he growth of 3D mammospheres. Collectively, the data provide convincing evidence that the encapsulation of carboplatin and olaparib into liposomal constructs to form the OLICARB nanoparticles may represent the viable approach for the treatment of tumors wi th the aim to eliminate the possible effects of acquired resistance.

Despite their clinical success, their uses are limited due to high toxicity and incidences of drug resistance. The application of platinum(IV) prodrug strategy has provided an excellent alte rnative to overcoming drawbacks associated with conventional platinum(II) drug therapy and is a promising strategy to obtain next -generation platinum drugs. Although many platinum(IV) complexes have been developed, researchers still do not fully comprehend how this new class of platinum drugs are processed at the cellular level. Current approaches to study platinum compounds such as elemental techniques and fluorescence- tagging have their limitations. The use of exogenous platinum - selective fluorescent sens ors could potentially help to overcome challenges associated with these methodologies. These platinum -selective fluorescent sensors would provide a direct and efficient method of probing platinum(IV) complexes, allowing us to acquire better understanding of these compounds. Previously, our group developed a platinum -selective rhodamine -based fluorescent turn -on probe equipped with a diethyldithiocarbamate recognition motif to demonstrate the intracellular reduction of a series of platinum(IV) carboxylate pr odrugs in cells.[1]Subsequently, through structure -activity relationship studies, the detection capability of the turn -on probe was enhanced by incorporation of a thiospirolactam.[2]Herein, we report the first ratiometric probe based on FRET for selectiv e platinum sensing to investigate platinum(IV) anticancer c omplexes in biological systems.[3]The ability of the probe to distinguish between platinum(II) species and their parental platinum(IV) prodrug complexes allowed us to apply the probe in cells to study the intracellular activation of platinum(IV) prodrug complexes. The correlation between the amount of active platinum(II) species available after intracellular reduction of platinum(IV) complexes to their cytotoxicity and the role glutathione plays in the reduction of platinum(IV) complexes were investigated.

However, the effectiveness of metal -based compounds as antitumor agents is often hampered by their poor water solubility, low bioavailability, and lack of target specificity. Inorganic click (iClick) reactions [1],which allow easy tuning of the bioavailability and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity) properties of novel compounds for bioactivity studies, can be utilized for a modular access to molecular diversity in transition metal complexes with novel structural motifs. In this work, a series of Pd(II) and Pt(II) triazolate complexes was successfully synthesized from the corresponding azide compounds and electron -deficient alkynes at room temperature by catalyst + 2] cycloaddition reaction . The trifluoromethyl group of the alkyne applied can serve as a sensitive 19F NMR marker to monitor the progress of the reaction and allows studies of reaction kinetics and stereochemical preference [2]. Thus, the progress of the iClick reaction was tracked by 19F NMR spectroscopy, which allowed identification of key intermediates as well as N1N2 isomerization of the triazolate -metal bond. K NMR spectroscopy demonstrated that the Pd -azide compound is much more reactive than the Pt-azide analogue , and iClick reactions involving alkynes with stronger electron -withdr awing groups react faster than the other ones. In addition, the resulting triazolate complexes show generally high cytotoxicity towards a human brain tumor cell line (GaMG), and Pt-triazolate complex is more active than its Pd -triazolate analogue. Interestingly, thecytotoxicity was also enhanced by increasing the leng th of chains from the triazolate substituents. References [1]T. J. Del Castillo, S. Sarkar, K. A. Abboud, A. S.

Silver compounds have been explored as antimicrobial agents for centuries. After the first report of the antibacterial acti vities of silver sulfadiazine , used in the treatment of bacterial infections in skin burns and wounds in the 1960's, the interest in the synthesis of new silver -based compounds increased [1]. The success of a silver complex as a metallodrug will depend on t he choice of ligand, because it can play an important role in the properties of the compounds, including stability, solubility and release of ions Ag (I) ions [2]. Amantadine (atd) is an amine derivative of adamantane known for its action against the replication of the influenza A virus. The mechanism of inhibition of the viral replication is related with the direct interaction of the drug with the ion channel of the M2 viral protei n [3]. So, the aim of this work was the synthesis and characterization of a novel silver(I) complex with amantadine (Ag -atd) and the study of its biological activities . The silver(I) complex was synthesized as follows: a mantadine , in its neutral form (0.90 mmol) , was dissolved in a solution containing 5.0 mL of water and 1.0 mL of a 1.25 mol L-1 aqueous solution of nitric acid . After one hour of stirring at room temperature, an aqueous solution containing 0.9 0 mmol of silver nitrate was added to the solution of the ligand (molar composition 1:1 metal/ligand). Then, a solution of potassium hydroxide (0.44 mol L-1) was added dropwise to the reaction mixture, with precipitation of a light -grey solid. The solid obt ained was collected by filtration, washed with water and dried in a desiccator over P 4O10. Elemental, thermogravimetric and mass spectrometric analyses indicated a 1:2 metal/ligand ratio, with the molecular composition AgC 20H34N2\u00b7NO 3. The crystal structure was determined by single crystal X -ray studies and confirmed the coordination of amantadine to the Ag(I) ion by the nitrogen atom. The spectral analysis by infrared and 1H, 13C and {15N,1H} nuclear magnetic resonance reinforced the coordination by the NH 2 group. Computational studies revealed the vibration modes similar to th ose found experimentally. The in vitro antibacterial assays showed the activity of the Ag-atd complex over Staphylococcus aureus (Gram -positive) , Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram mL-1. Biophysical based bovine serum albumin, while agarose gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that the compound does not interact with plasmid DNA.

In effort to find a new drug that circumvent resistance to conventional bifunctional platinum -based drugs, d esigning complexes for mitochondria -targeted therapy is of importance as the nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) mechanism is absent for mt-DNA [1].Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as an alternative method for its a non -invasive nature to treat selectively cancer using red light activation of the drug in presence of oxygen [2].We have combined these two methodologies into one by designing a new class of monofunctional platinum(II) complexes having photoactive BODIPY (boron dipyrromethene) ligand for PDT activity in visible light on a pyriplatin motif. The pyriplatin -B complexes, cis -[Pt- designed and synthesized, and their photocytotoxic properties studied. The activity has been shown to be tunable on incorporation of one or two heavy iodine atoms to the BODIPY co re thus transforming a highly fluorescent non- iodo BODIPY core to non -fluorescent but high singlet oxygen generating diiodo- BODIPY core as evidenced from the DPBF titration and DNA photocleavage activity. The mono -iodo BODIPY core retain ed both the properties and acted as a fluorescent photosensitizer showing both the effects. Complex cis -[Pt(NH 3)2(4-Me- py)Cl](NO 3) (4) was used as a control for determining the structural aspects by X -ray crystallography. The cytotoxicity of the pyriplatin -B complexes was tested against A549 (human lung cancer), MCF -7 (human breast cancer), and HaCaT (human skin keratinocyte) cells in visible light with IC50 values in nanomolar (IC50 0.05 M, light of 400- 700 nm, J cm-2). The complexes were nont oxic (IC50 > 100 M) in dark. The of 1and 2near 535 nm in 1% DMSO/DMEM were used for cellular imaging by confocal microscopy study, which showed their mitochondrial localization. This was further supported by platinum estimation from isola ted mitochondria and mitochondrial depolarization through a JC -1 assay. The photo mediated apoptotic cell death was evidenced from flow cytometric assays, annexin -V/FITC -PI and cell cycle arrest in sub- G1 and G2/M phases. The complexes showed binding to 9- ethylguanine as a model nucleobase to form monoadducts. The combination of photodynamic therapy with DNA cross -linking property enhanced the anticancer potential of the monofunctional BODIPY -conjugates, namely, pyriplatins. This work provides new insights and directions in the chemistry of monofunctional platinum(II) complexes and highlights the synergistic effect of the photoactive prodrugs towards the development of next generation of photo- chemotherapeutics agents [3].

[1] Only one drug is currently known to treat the disease: the nitroheterocyclic compound called benznidazole. The drug is effective only in the acut e phase of the disease and no drug has been discover ed since 7 decades . In addition , the diagnostic s of Chagas is complex, mainly during the chronic phase, due to the lack of symptoms and the low parasitemia .[2] Therefore, considering the similarity between the metabolism of eukaryotic parasites and that of neoplastic cells, [3] an interesting alternative for the diagnosis and evaluation of the clinical evolution of Chagas disease is radiodiagnosis based on 99mTc. Moreover, due to the comparable chemical properties of Re and Tc [ 4], non- radioactive Re complexes could be employed as model of comparison to the technetium analogue complexes as well as in chemotherapy of Chagas disease. In this sense, t he choice of a good li gand system is important in order to stabilize the metal center as well as to acquire the desired biological activity . However , benznidazole itself is not a choice since it is able to act as a monodentate ligand only. On the other hand, megazol, another nitroheterocyclic derivative , presents in vivo activity against T. cruzi and T. brucei strains, acting as an inhibitor of essential enzymes for the parasite s such as trypanothione reductase and NADH N ONN NO2 benznidazole megazole This work thus deals with the synthesis and characterization of megazole and new complexes containing the fac-[M(CO) 3+] (M = 185/187Re or 99mTc) fragment with L1: R1 = H, R2 = H L2: R1 = H, R2 = Me L3: R1 = Me, R2 = Me [MX(L)(CO) 3] Once this objective is achieved, the products will be compared with those obtained by reactions with the 99mTc isotope.

Since many cancer cells are sensitive to ferroptosis, this type of cell death appears as a novel approach in the treatment of cancer [2]. Hence, it was of interest, if iron(III) salophene complexes are also competent to induce ferroptosis. For this purpo se a series of chlorido [N,N' -disalicylidene -1,2-phenylenediamine]iron(III) complexes with varying phenylenediamine cores was synthesized and investigated concerning their impact on different leukemic cell lines (HL -60, K -562, SD -1). Particularly, the parti cipation of ferroptosis in the mode of action was evaluated. The proliferation and the metabolic activity were diminished concentration -dependently upon incubation of the leukemic cells with the iron(III) salophene complexes. They caused the formation of ROS. As the antimetabolic activity of the compounds was not completely abolished by N-acetyl -L- cysteine, a scavenger of mitochondrial ROS, the effects were related to lipid -ROS as part of ferroptosis. Intriguingly, the antimetabolic effect was fully revoke d upon concomitant administration of either the ferroptosis and/or necroptosis inhibitor Ferrostatin -1 and the of ferroptosis and/or necroptosis is dependent on the substituents of the 1,2 -phenylenediamine moiety. The regulation of both ferroptosis and necroptosis by simple substituents may allow a synergistic adjustment of these cell death modalities for the treatment of cancer. Due to the strong binding of the complexes to the iron transport protein apo -Trans ferrin, a cellular uptake mediated by apo -Transferrin is assumed. Additionally, the uptake into leukemic cells was confirmed by cellular uptake studies. To exclude the release of iron from the complexes, the stability under physiological -like conditions a s well as in the presence of Ferrostatin -1 and the iron specific chelator Deferoxamine was investigated. No decomposition of the iron(III) salophene complexes was affirmed. Herewith we demonstrate for the first time that, besides free iron ions, intact iro n salophene complexes are capable to induce ferroptosis. Our findings, that iron(III) salophene complexes serve as ferroptosis inducers represent a promi sing perspective for the future development of anti -cancer active metallodrugs.

In particular , the group of copper -based complexes named Casiopeinas \u00ae have received much at tention and their mechanism of action has been extensively studied since their structure is simple and they can be inexpensively synthesized (1 ,2). On the other hand , Vanadium -containing compoun ds both in the form of complexes or simple polyoxovanadates have also been studied as potential antitumor agents (3). Here we report potential prodrugs that would release the two metals , V and Cu, in usable form to act in tandem against cancer cells. The new series of Casiopeinas bridged by a cyclo- tetravanadate ion allows the synthesis of stable compounds with a generic formula (N,N\u00b4 Cu AA) 2 (V4O12), where (N,N\u00b4) represent , and AA ions (Lys ine, Orn ithine, and Glycine ). Importantly, the structure allows compounds that can be easily crystal lized and characterized by various methods . Financial support by VIEP -BUAP and CONACYT.

Square planar p latinum (II)based anticancer agents were developed into a class of well -established drugs, used worldwide in the treatment of various cancerous diseases for the last 40 years. C isplatin , the most widely used drug, hastwo major drawbacks ; toxicity ( ototoxicity andnephrotoxicity ) and inherent and acquired resistance. Clinicians try to overcome resistance by combination chemotherapy administering several drugs with different modes of action and different cellular targets. This app roach is difficult to manage because each drug has its own pharmacokinetics, biodistribution etc. [1,2] Octahedral p latinum(IV) complexes allow us to combine two addition albioactive molecules with the cisplatin, in a way that they are all released inside t he cancer cell fo llowing reduction of the Pt(IV) thereby forming \"multi -action\" prodrugs. These complexes are more stable and therefore less reactive in physiological systems until they reach the cells which is expected to lead to fewer side effects. Comb retastatin A4 (CA4) is an antimitotic and antiangiogenic natural product in clinical trials for the treatment of a naplastic thyroid cancer . It acts by inhibiting tubulin polymerization which leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. It is a potent cytotoxic agent exhibiting antiproliferative effects in various cell lines in the low micromolar to low nanomolar range. [3] CA4 was successfully attached to the platinum(IV) viaacarbonate linkagefor the first time .One advantage of this new method is thatdirectly following reduction of the complex ,CA4 is released without any structural alterations of the active drug through decarboxylation of the carbonate bond. [4]Different bioactive ligands were attached to the other axial position to gain a dual or triple action complex. Here, we discuss the activity of these new potential anticancer drugs towards several cancer cell lines , investigat ingreduction rates and stability in cell culture medium versus human serum.

Lay1 1School of Chemistry, University of Sydney , Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia . 2Department of Chemistry, Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond, VA 23284 , USA. Ruthenium complexes have emerged as promising alternatives to existing platinum drugs as cancer chemotherapeutics, with the Ru(II) arene complexes being particularly attractive owing to the number of properties and antitumour effects they can possess depending on ligand choice [1]. In addition, many metal -based drugs have been recently recognized for exerting immunogenic effects, a promising new research direction [2]. Howev er in the case of Ru(II) arene complexes, these effects, along with mechanisms of action and biological targets, are not fully understood. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane- enclosed particles excreted by all known cell types. Understanding of key r oles they play in a number of biological processes including intercellular communication, disease progression and drug action mechanisms is currently emerging [3]. They offer unique, multifaceted opportunities to study both cancer as a disease, and Ru(II) arene complexes as potential treatments. Additionally, the role of interactions between proteoglycan species and metal -based drugs remains an underdeveloped, yet highly exploitable, research direction in chemotherapy [4]. In this project, a library of Ru(I I) arene complexes (1-9 in the figure) covering a variety of ligands and modes of antitumour activities has been prepared , and investigated in breast cancer cell lines and their secreted EVs through spectroscopic techniques and biochemical assays in the biochemical profiles of EVs sourced from cells treated with the complexes were observed, with implications for impacts on cell signalling , drug resistance and the development of disease mechanisms . Our recent metalloglycomics studies on the interactions of the complexes with proteoglycans will also be discussed.

In spite of the great success of cisplatin, its clinical use is associated with side -effects su ch as ototoxicity, neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, inherited or acquired resistance, and a narrow spectrum of activity. A new class of anticancer chemotherapeutics has been developed to target the translocator protein (TSPO) which is overexpressed in certain cancers including brain, liver, breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancer, with the aim to overcome the limitations of the clinically used platinum drugs. In this work, Pt(IV) complexes have been designed as n ew anticancer metallodrugs that selectively target the mitochondria of cancer cells by combining the favourable cytotoxic properties of Pt with the capability of TSPO binders to act as delivery vehicles for antimitochondrial agents. The complexes have been fully characterized. Cytotoxic and mechanistic studies of these complexes will also be reported.

[1] Identification of hypoxic cells plays a critical role for early diagnosis of diseased conditions hence to prevent the progression of the disease. 64CuII-tracers such as 64CuII-diacetyl -bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone), ATSM -64CuII,hasbeen proposed to become one of the most promising PET agents for hypoxia imaging. [2]It was suggested that ATSM -64Cu(II) tracer is actively uptake by the cell and it is incorporated in the cellular copper cycle by 3 proteins: Ctr1, Atox1, and ATP7B .However , the mechanism of cellular uptake of ATSM -64CuIIremains unclear. We studied the interactions of ATSM -CuIIcomplex with human copper -binding peptides/proteins under strong reducing conditions using UV -Visiblespectroscopy and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy. ATSM -CuIIremains protein, also in order of AA > Cys > GSH (very sluggish) .The use of bicinchoninic acid ( BCA )as CuIdetector helped to follow the reduction reaction of ATSM -CuIIin the presence of intracellular CuIsinks, GSH BCA enhances a chromogenic (BCA) 2-CuIcomplex ; however may also efficiently competes for BCA for CuIbinding. Atox1 significantly decrease the rate of ATSM- CuIIreduction. Even in the presence of BCA, the CuImay bind Atox1 instead of BCA as no (BCA) 2-CuIwas detected. Similar results were observed in the case of GSH however the low amount of (BCA) 2-CuIwas identified which confirms that GSH has a little ability to bind CuIthan Atox1. Overall, this study suggests that the extracellular CuIIbinding peptides do not affect the stability of ATSM -CuII. However, the intracellular copper protein -Atox1 (Human) and GSH may affect the reduction of ATSM- CuIIthrough CuIbinding but shows low activity.

In our recent work, we have identified that Pt1a engage swith vimentin. T he binding interactions and associated cellular responses were validated comprehensively by different techniques . Computational docking studies further demonstrate the possible binding modes of Pt1a with vimentin. Regarding vimentin asa mesenchymal marker in epithelial -to- mesenchymal transition during tumor progression [2], the anti-metastatic property of Pt1a was examined using mouse model of metastasis. Pt1a significantly inhibited the tumor growth of lung metastasis without apparent body weight loss over a month of treatment. In metabolism studies, Pt1a was found to undergo cytochrome P450 phase I and phase II metabolism, generating different hydrophilic metabolites. The hydroxylated derivat ives of Pt1a were then synthesized and characterized, serv ingas the standards for verifying the metabolites in rat liver microsomal extract and mouse urine by using UPLC -QTOF -MS. The metabolites were shown to be less cytotoxic toward s a panel of cancer cell lines compared with the parent Pt1a, presumably due to the lower extent of cellular uptake .Furthermore, PEGylation [3]was employed to alter the in vivo biological response of Pt(II)-NHC complex . The PEGlyated Pt(II) conjugate exhibited potent anti tumor activity in lung cancer xenograft model with prolonged plasma retention and improve doverall biodistribution of platinum content in mice. These results demonstrate that the target engagement of Pt1a with cellular vimentin and the resultant biological consequence s, as well as the importance of metabolism and the feasibility of structural modification of the pincer platinum(II)- NHC scaffold A.

China, u3005690@connect.hku.hk Being the top ten threats to global health in 2019 as enumerated by the World Health Organization (WHO), antimicrobial resistance (AMR) empowers bacteria the ability in confronting existing antimicrobial agents. Metallo --lactamase is a subclass B1 MBL and able to hydrolyze almost all -lactam antibiotics, including the last resort carbapenems. Combination therapy is regarded as one of the promising approaches in combating AMR. We previously found that metallo -agents are potential MBL inhibitors [1].Despite the fact that gallium -based agents are well-known for their therapeutic activity in cancers, infections and inflammatory conditions [2],previous studies demonstrat ed that clinically approved gallium compounds exhibit edantibacterial activity against several human pathogens , including ESKAPE species [3,4], aligning with our fi ndings. Here, we found that gallium -based agents exhibited good antimicrobial activity against MBL -positive bacteria. We show that gallium complexes had synergistic effect with meropenem (MER), could reduce the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of MER by 16- folds , with a fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index of 0.375. Co-treatment of gallium complexes could reduce bacter ial density by over 10,000- folds in comparison with any single componen t after 8 hrs, indicative of remarkably enhanced bactericidal activity of MER , while gallium itself sho wed no inhibition to bacterial growth. Enzyme assay showed that enzymatic activity wasalmost completely retarded in the presence of gallium, with a half -maximum inhibitory concentration (IC 50)of262.9 M (\u00b144.5 M). We therefore conclude that gallium -based agents may serve as promising antimicrobial candidates to combat AMR caused by MBL producing bacteria.

Precious metal -based anticancer agents offer novel mechanisms of action which might address acquired resistance and undesired side effects of platinum drugs. [1] Organometallic iridium complexes have emerged as effective catalytic agents for the potential treatment of cancer.[2] For example, the h alf- sandwich s, exhibit s nanomolar activity in a wide range of cancer cell lines in the NCI -60 screen, and is an order of magnitude more potent than cisplatin. The mechanism of action appears to involve catalytic hydride transfer from coenzyme NADH to oxygen to produce the ROS H 2O2.[3] We report here the synthesis, characterization and anticancer activity of a new family of half-sandwich organometallic iridium(III) complexes which are relatively inert towards ligand exchange but exhibit potent anticancer activity, and investigations of t heir mechanism of activation . Density functional theory (DFT) calculation s on their hydrolysis and binding to biomolecules have provided insights into their activation. The complexes have interesting catalytic activity, which appears to involve ligand -based reactions.

To disentangle the ensemble average and to visualize distinct conformational states and state-transitions , their fine s urveillance is achievable at the single -molecule (sm) level by smFRET [1]. In this study, we take advantage of this technique to monitor the splicing events of a long non -coding RNA , namely the group II intron ai5, found in the mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Recent advances in the field of splicing by in vitro studies under near-physiological conditions especially focus on the nature of ligation of the coding regions catalyzed by the group II intron itself [2]. In addition, t hese endeavors are greatly complemented with conformational state analysis by employing smFRET [3]. Nevertheless, to fully capture the complex self -catalytic mechanism, it is crucial to couple the changes in the ribozyme structure with function. Oriented towards multi -color fluorescence imaging, here, we propose a highly precise and stable intermolecular labeling strategy, which is promising to site -specifically tag the particularly long intron, without compromising the ribozyme activity. This bi oorthogonal approach involves phosphoramidate activation of the 5' terminus of the RNA and its further functionalization with an amine modified fluorophore, as well as the periodate oxidation of the 3' end and its subsequent modification with a hydrazide a ttached dye [4]. Our choice of FRET pair is Cy3 and Cy5 dyes, donor and acceptor, respectively. Thereby, dual fluorescent labeling of the flanking exons grants the visualization of the folding pathways and the self -splicing mechanism of the intron.

Cancer multi -drug resistance (MDR) is a challenge problem for cancer treatment [1,2]. Coumarin has been selected due to the wildly presence in various natural products [ 3], as well as their extensive properties as antibacterial, antio xidant, anti -inflammatory and anticancer [ 4-6].Coumarin acetic acid connected with amino acid fragment has been considered a useful strategy for design new bioactive compounds with promising biological properties [ 7]. Novel coumarin amino acid derivatives were synthesized. The structure of synthesized compounds has established on basis of different spectral data. The optimization geometry, frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), thermodynamic parameters and chemical reactiv ity, were discussed using DFT \\B3LYP by 6- 311G* basis set, to identify a clear view for inter and intramolecular interaction of tested compounds. The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) has plotted to investigate a recognition manner of synthesized comp ounds upon COX -2 receptor. All tested compounds showed a promising (NLOs) nonlinear optical properties. Bond dissociation energy (BDE) has studied to investigate a potency of these molecules against autoxidation mechanism Polynomial molecular docking logar ithms have performed into the COX - 2 active site for tested compounds. The docking protocol that has low RMSD has selected for discussion the binding affinity. The compounds with a high docking score 3,4,6- 8,10 and 11 were selected for additional study against ADMET insilico, which showed that these compounds are a good oral bioavailability without observed carcinogenesis affect. The compounds (3,4,6- 8,10 and 11) which that passed through docking and ADMET profile have examined their potency against (MCF -7) breast cancer cell in vitro. The compound 7 showed a highest potency against MCF -7 with IC 50 value 0.39 M. The QSAR model has created to discover the structural necessity inhibition of MCF -7. The derived QSAR model has a statistically significant with a good predictive power. References [1]J. Bronikowska, E. Szliszka, D. A. Cavalli, Colizzi, M. V. Andrisano, A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. M.K.

Rolf.Griesser@unibas.ch Fifteen years ago it had been pointed out that in the physiological pH range of 7.5 the xanthine residue of xanthosine nucleotides exists in a monodeprotonated form, i.e., the (N1)H/(N3)H sites have lost one H+ [1,2]. C onsidering important metabolic intermediates [1,3,4 ], it is surprising that the indicated acid -base p roperty is often overlooked [3,5,6]. For example, i n the literature [3,5,6 ], the structure of XMP is often shown in analogy to guanosine 5' -monophosphate , which is not correct [4 ] and thus, revisions will be needed , e.g., in calculations concerning thermodynamics [5 ]. Monoprotonated H+ still at the phosphate, hence, XMP2- should preferably be written as (X - H\u00b7MP\u00b7H)2-. Indeed, XMP2- is a minority species ( ca 12%), the dominating tautomer being (X - H\u00b7MP\u00b7H)2- with about 88%. This species loses H+ from P(O) 2(OH)- (pKa = 6.45 \u00b1 0.02) [2,4] and exists thus at pH 7.5 mainly as (X - H\u00b7MP)3-. In 9 -methylxanthine deprotonation occurs to over 99% in xanthosinate already about 30% are (N1)H -deprotonated and for (X - H\u00b7MP)3- it is concluded [4 ] (see the taut omer s below) that (N1)H deprotonation is further favored, especially upon metal ion (M2+) coordination at N7. The anionic xanthinate moiety has a pronounced M2+ affinity [7 ]; the resulting complexes, formed with (X - H\u00b7MP\u00b7H)2-, are best written as (M\u00b7X - H\u00b7MP\u00b7H)\u00b1; they all have M2+ at the N7/[(C6)O] site and H+ at the phosphate [4,7 ]. In the tentative structure shown below, (C6)O participates via H-bonding. Inter - estingly, M2+ form s macrochelates with P(O) 2(OH)-; their average result is best explained by an outer - sphere interaction between M2+ and P(O) 2(OH)-. Note, the \"closed\" ( , and are thus independent of the absolute stabilities of the complexes [ 4,7]. Release of H+ from P(O) 2(OH)- in (M\u00b7X - H\u00b7MP\u00b7H)\u00b1 leads to a shift of M2+ from the nucleobase to the phosphate, the latter now bei ng the primary binding site [ 4,7]. In the resulting M(X - H\u00b7MP)- species the M2+ ions behave as individuals, i.e., the macrochelates involving N7 possibly also C(6)O , e.g., with Ca2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ form to about 0, 50, 95, and 88%, respectively [ 4,7]. Finally, with regard to biologi cal systems one may add that the negatively charged xanthinate residue is able to undergo aromatic- ring stacking as proven for Cu(1,10- phenanthroline)(X - H\u00b7MP)- complexes [8].

These structures are further stabilised by theprese nce alkali -metal cations Na+.Guanine sequences are found at telomeric regions and near thepromoter region of several oncogenes ( c-myc, c- kit). Formation of G -quadruplex structures in these regions inhibit telomerase and regulate the transcription of certain oncogenes. Thus small molecules capable of inducing G -quadruplex formation are of great interest for the development of anticancer drugs. Metal complexes with a broad range of structural and electronic properties can be exploited for the design of G4 b inders [1, 2]. Here ,we present the interaction of nine Pd(II) and Pt(II) complexes bearing hydrazone -based tridentate intercalator displacement (FID) assay were em ployed to study the binding interactions. All the metal complexes were found to in teract with the quadruplex sequences and increase the melting temperature of the G - quadruplex es.According to the FID assay, some of the complexes belong to the highest- affinity metal - containing quadruplex binders reported so far. Their affinity towards quadruplex DNA is up to 80- fold higher than to a reference double helix , which conf irms the selective interaction of the complexes with quadruplex sequences [3].

We developed a metal -complex -conjugated double -stranded DNA (dsDNA) binder which can sequence -specifically cause damage to the target DNA. Recent development sof artificial nucleic acid analogues improved sequence specificity and DNA recognition affinity of oligonucleotides and those impr ovements havewiden edtheir applicability, for example, to DNA sensing, DNA nanoarchitecture, and gene expression control. Although hybridization -based DNA binder mainly targets single -stranded DNA , the recognition of dsDNA is attracting much attention in order to target genom icDNA ,which exists as a double -strand edform in cellular .Peptide nucleic acid (PNA), one of the artificial nucleic acid analogue s,was reported to directly invade into dsDNA and form a pair of PNA/DNA duplex es[1].This invasion of PNA selectively recognizes sequences in double- stranded DNA and is expected to be utilized for intracellular DNA recognition, but the invasion efficiency is decreased at physiological salt concentration s. Here, we developed a conjugate of PNA with Rucomplex (Ru-PNA) .The Rucomplex is known as a minor -groove binder of DNA [2]and should reinforce the DNA binding affinity of PNA by tightly anchoring PNA to DNA [3].In addition, the Ru complex was also reported to break DNA strands by photoreaction [4]. ThisRu-PNA conjugate is expected to recognize andcleave the target DNA sequence specifically andshould be applied to genome editing. Because PNA is synthesized by standard solid- phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), t he Ru complex with a carboxylic acid linker was synthesized to be introduced via the amino group on the PNA during SPPS. After the optimization of the introduction manner ,the Ru complex was modified to the side chain of diaminopropionic acid. The optim ized Ru-PNA formed a more stable duplex with DNA than the PNA without Ru complex modification (non -Ru PNA) and showed higher T mvalues even under physiological condition. The invasion efficiency of Ru -PNA was evaluated by electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) , and t he Ru- PNA showed much higher invasion efficiency than non -Ru PNA. After the formation of the invasion complex ,blue light was irradiated to the solution containing the invasion complex to evoke the DNA breaks by Ru-complex photoreaction .Although non-Ru PNA caused almost no change in EMSA results, the band of invasion complex with the Ru -PNA disappeared by this light irradiation. The DNA damage was also observed even on super-coiled plasmid DNA andgave an open circular DNA. These phenomena were not observed with single -base-mismatched target DNA, and thus the Ru -PNA can sequence -specifically cause damage to the target DNA. I n addition to the Ru complex , the investigation of other metal complex es is currently underway in our laborat ory. References [1]J. Lohse, O. Dahl, P. E. Nielsen, USA 1999, 96, 11804 -11808.

Group II introns are a class of self -splicing ribozymes and belong to the largest ribozy mes in nature [1].In vitro , they fold into their native structure in a stepwise process ,yetMg2+dependent manner [2]. For studying the foldi ng mechanism, the model system D135 -L14, derived from the group II intron Sc.ai5 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is widely used . The construct possesses all necessary domains (D) for catalytic activity and has two additional loops (L) for labelling with fluorescence dyes ,thus suitable for single -molecule F\u00f6rster r esonance energy transfer (smFRET). Previous studies assumed an overall compaction of the construct from the unfolded to the native state [2-4].For further insight sinto the folding mechanism, knowing the positions of the flanking exons during the folding process gives information about the catalytically relevant 5' -and 3' splice sites and thus of the catalytic core of the ribozyme. For this reason, we developed a n ew construct eD135 -L14e that comprises short flanking exons serving as additional labeling platforms [5]. Hence, together with L1 and L4 labeling this enables various FRET and distance trajectories to study the folding in a comprehensive manner [5]. To det ermine a FRET network, i.e., the combination of multiple FRET trajectories to attribute distinct FRET values of different labelling positions to the same conformational state, smFRET experiments under various Mg2+ concentrations will be performed. We assum e, that FRET histograms will change and reveal the magnesium(II) dependent population of conformational states ranging from the unfolded to the native fold of the ribozyme. The Cy3/5 labelled construct is investigated, using both total internal reflection microscopy (TIRM) and confocal microscopy smFRET, to ensure data integrity on all time scales. With the FRET network at hand, we will be able to solve the dynamic pathway from the pre -to the post catalytic state of the ribozyme.

Artificial nucleases have potential applications in the field of biotechnology and medicine. [1,2] In particular, coordination compounds with nuclease activity are candidates as chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of cancer [3]. Here , we report the synthesis and characterization of a new mononuclear copper (I) complex derived of phenanthroline, [Cu( L1)2](ClO 4), helicate, [Cu 2(L2)2](ClO 4)2, (2). The structure of both complexes was confirmed in solid and solution phase through NMR, UV-Vis, elemental analys is, electrochemistry and X-ray diffraction (fig. 1). Interestingly, both complexes can operate as artif icial nucleases against pBR322 plasmid DNA, with no any oxidant agent such as hydrogen pe roxide. The results of DN A cleavage show that the binuclear helicate has a higher activ ity, with a moderate activity at 1 M (~30% DNA cleavage), while complete conversion from the supercoile d form to nicked and lineal form at 5 M. The mononuclear complex shows only moderated activity at 25 M (~44% DNA cleavage). Mechanistic studies by electrophoresis technique using ROS scavengers, showed that HO radical and H 2O2 are involved in the damage of DNA by oxidative process. [4] Differences in the activity of the mono and bimetallic complexes are discussed in terms of their nuclearity, cationic charge, size and geometrical distortions from the copper atoms. Both copper(I) complexes had been studied as cytotoxic agents in human bone (MG-63), breast (MCF-7) and colon (HT-29) cancer cell lines, presen ting activity at the sub-micromolar concentration level.

This work is focused on the investigation of the solution structure and folding mechanism of the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 3 (CPEB3) ribozyme by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Ribozymes are RNA molecules that act as chemical ca talysts in cells. The discovery of ribozymes was a milestone in RNA research and revealed the unique role of RNA in a multitude of cellular reactions. The CPEB3 ribozyme is until now the only confirmed small ribozyme in mammals and its role remains still unknown. [1]As RNA function is directly linked to structure, structural studies are the basis to understand RNA function. The CPEB3 ribozyme belongs to the Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV) -like family of self -cleaving ribozymes that have a nested double pseudo knot fold and a 5' -end cleavage activity in common. [2]The best studied ribozyme in this family is the HDV ribozyme itself, whose three dimensional structure was solved by X -ray crystallography .[3]Even though, the number of newly ribozyme is continuously increasing, the HDV ribozyme is still the only one with a known structure. Therefore ,solving the structure of the CPEB3 ribozyme will not only help to enlighten its biological role but also to expand the knowledge on the HDV -like ribozyme family in general. NMR structure determination of such a large RNA is a challenging task due to heavy spectral overlap and large line widths of the proton resonances. To overcome this issue ,we use different labeling schemes . For example ,we use p artially deuterated nucleotides, 13C,15N multidimensional NMR spectroscopy .

L. self -assembling supramolecule with a highly specific molecular recognition between two complementary oligonucleotides during the formation of a double helix. The double -helical structure of DNA is stabilized by two non -covalent interactions, the stacking of the planar aromatic nucleobases and the hydrogen bonding within the complementary base pairs. DNA can be used as a ligand system for the coordination of metal ions, involving the concept of metal -mediated base pairing. Here, the hydrogen bonds, as present in a canonical duplex, are formally replaced by metal -ligand coordinate bonds [1, 2]. In the work presented here, we developed the concept of using light as an external trigger t o control the formation of a thymine -based metal -mediated base pair [3]. We introduced a photo- labile protecting group [4]in a position important for the formation of the metal -mediated base pair so that the duplex is unable to bind the metal ion unless it has been irradiated with light. Using this caged thymidine residue, the formation of a T -Hg(II)- T base pair was successfully triggered by light. In contrast, when applying a bidentate artificial nucleoside analog complementary to the caged thymidine, theduplex experiences a minor metal -induced thermal stabilisation already prior to irradiation , which is intensified upon irradiation. This indicates that the nucleobases involved in metal -mediated base pairing need to be chosen properly to achieve an optimal outcome. The possibility of using light as an external trigger for metal- mediated base pair formation significantly extents the scope of this type of DNA modification. In combination with DNA that switches its topology upon metal- mediated base pair formation, interesting applications are anticipated.

These very same properties that make copper a \" threatunder control\" toliving systems are explored for the development of copper -based anticancer compounds. Here we describe a series of copper(II) compounds promoting the cleavage of the phosphodiester bond in nucleic acids. [Cu(phen) 2]2+was the first copper compound to have its nuclease activity identified [2].Nuclease activity was observed for all compounds evaluated here but 2 (which contains the macrocyclic imine) .The imine compounds 1 and 4demonstrated nuclease activity even in the absence of added reducing agent (ascorbic acid). In the presence of reducing agent, the most potent nucleases were compounds 4, 6 and 7, which led to 100% plasmid cleavage at 2.5, 1.25 and1.25 \u00b5M respectively. The cleavage mechanism varies widely among the compounds studied here , but it can be grouped consistently based on the nature of the ligand. For compounds 1,3and 4(imine -containing) , the nuclease activity is based o n single toxygen and /or peroxide. For the thiosemicarbazone- containing 5, the nuclease activity has contribution from singlet oxygen, superoxide and peroxide. Finally, for the pyridine -based compounds 6and 7,singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals are present, but the most prominent species is peroxide. Conformational changes on calf thymus (CT) DNA induced by the model compounds were also followed by circular dichroism (CD). All compounds studie dhere were found to interact with CT -DNA to some extent. Specifically, 2 (containing the cyclic imine) is less reactive than the analogue 1 ;4(single imine) is more reactive than 3 (two imines) ; and the dinuclear 7 is more reactive than the mononuclear 6 . iesobserved 7are directly to properties .

School of Physical Sciences, University of Liverpool, L69 7ZB, UK. Methylation is an underpinning process of life and provides control for biological processes such as DNA synthesis, cell growth and apoptosis. Methionine Adenosyltransferases (MAT) produce the cellular methyl donor, S -Adenosylmethionine (SAMe). Dysregulation of SAMe level is a relevant event in many diseases, including cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma and colon cancer. In addition, mutation of Arg264 in MAT1 causes isolated persistent hypermethioninemia, which is characterized by low activity of the enzyme in liver and high level of plasma methionine. In mammals, MAT1/2 and MATV1/V2 are the catalytic and the major form of regulatory subunits respectively. A gating loop comprising residues 113 -131 is located beside the active site of catalytic subunits (MAT 1/2) and provides controlled access to the active site. Here, we provide evidence of how the gating loop facilitates the catalysis and define some of the key elements that control the catalytic efficiency. Mutation of several residues of MAT2 including G ln113, Ser114 and Arg264 lead to partial or total loss of enzymatic activity, demonstrating their critical role in catalysis. The enzymatic activity of the mutated enzymes is restored to varying degree upon complex formation with MATV1 or MATV2, endorsin g its role as an allosteric regulator of MAT2 in response to the levels of methionine or SAMe. Finally, the protein - protein interacting surface formed in MAT2:MAT complexes is explored to demonstrate that several quinolone -based compounds modulate the a ctivity of MAT2 and its mutants, providing a rational for chemical design/intervention responsive to the level of SAMe in the cellular environment.

Even though the sequences of these ribozymes exhibit great diversity (with the exception of a few nucleotides including thecatalytic cytosine) the complex fold into a double pseudoknot is well conserved. In order to better understand the complex folding of HDV -like ribozymes and to locate the metal ions involved in that particular fold, we would like to solve the three -dimension structure of the CPEB3 ribozyme by X -ray crystallography. However, many factors affect the successful crystallization process of RNA ,such as sample purity and homogeneity, structural dynamics as well as ligand binding .Based on the accompl ished crystallization of the HDV ribozyme we designed a number of different CPEB3 constructs. All of them include a binding site for the U1A protein as crystallization module to stabilize the CPEB3 structure . Our preliminary results reveal : (i) AllCPEB3 c onstruct scomprising the U1A binding sites are still catalytic active indicating that the internal folding of the ribozyme is not disturbed, (ii) the U1A protein is binding to the CPEB3 constructs, (iii) CPEB3 is crystallizing and preliminary scattering data until a resolution of 2.8 \u00c5 were achieved , and (i v)non-native gel analysis of unused crystal sprove the absence of degraded RNA .

Since their discovery, G -quadruplexes became increasingly interesting in the field of chemical biology due to their property to control the elongation of telomeres and the expression of oncogenes. Furthermore, first examples of a DNAzyme activity in G quadruplexes were shown.2Drawback of those systems was that the exact position and coordination environment of the catalytic active transition metal ion was largely unknown. In this context, the incorporation of covalently bound ligands into the backbone of G -quadruplex structures would be a next step in the development of DNAzymes. Recently, our group reported a first example of this strategy by incorporation of pyridine ligands, allowing the Cu(II) and Ni(II) mediated folding of G -quadruplex structures.3This was then exploited to trigger the folding of a thrombin inhibiting aptamer upon Cu(II) addition. Now, we incorporated - inspired by the natural amino acid histidine -an imidazole based ligand into G -quadruplex structures. We were able to show a tremendous acceleration of G -quadruplex formation as well as a stabilization by addition of different transition metals such as Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II). By varying the number of incorporated imidazole units, we were able to finetune metal affinities in accordance with their preferred coordination number. The concept of metal mediated GQs was then expanded to design an active peroxidase with the cofactor Hemin which is activated by Cu(II) addition.4 Financial support by RESOLV Cluster of Excellence EXC gratefully (2013) , 12843 -12847.

They are isolated from randomized sequence libraries by in vitro selection methods. DNAzymes can be applied in gene silencing, in biosensor technology, in diagnostics or as synthetic tools. Structural information on the architecture of the catalytic site are scarce, resulting in a poor understanding of the mechanisms of DNA -mediated catalysis. Our main focus is to obtain structu ral and functional information of the 10- 23 DNAzyme in complex with its RNA target in a catalytically active conformation by x- ray crystallography. The success of crystallization of nucleic acids highly depends on the properties of the biological sample, r ather than screening conditions. Therefore, we put great effort in searching for a suitable sample: The RNA -binding protein U1A will be used as a crystallization module to compensate the negatively charged surfaces of nucleic acids, which lead to a poor lo ng-range order. To capture the complex in a catalytically active conformation, the 2'OH group at the RNA cleavage site will be substituted by a fluorine atom. DNAzyme variants with single point mutations within a self -complementary core sequence will be screened to prevent the formation of a catalytically irrelevant duplex structure.602 603 ICBIC-19 ICBIC-19 Poster Presentations Nucleic Presentations Nucleic of Abstracts Book of AbstractsP322 Let It Go: Kinetics of Exon Unbinding in Group II Introns by FRET Molecular Dynamics Fabio D.

Formation of stable RNA tertiary contacts is inextricably linked to metal cations to compensate the electrostatic stress and guide RNA folding. Self -splicing group II introns establish long -range tertiary interactions between domain 1 and the upstream exon to accurately position the 5' -splice site within the ribozyme's active core. [1] Her e we use single -molecule FRET and computer simulations on a model RNA hairpin to monitor the kinetics of exon recognition and release in response to K+ and Mg2+. [2] We find that exon unbinding rates are heterogeneous as a result of degeneracy in the FRET states which in turn originates from the presence or absence of specifically coordinated Mg2+ ions. [2-5] We solve the rate system by hidden Markov modeling and identify the structural origin of the kinetic heterogeneity. While metal ion binding locks the RNA tertiary contact in a rigid conformation, molecular dynamics simulation show that strain on the sugar phosphate backbone is alleviated through fast sugar puckering. Switching between pucker conformations is pronounced in DNA exons which explains their lower affinity towards group II introns.

G-quadruplexes are classic DNA secondary structures formed by Ho ogsteen base pairing in guanine - rich oligonucleotides resulting in stacked guanine tetrads. They have been found to regulate the expression of oncogenes and human telomeric properties in vivo .[1]Recently in our group, the concept of metal -mediated base pairing, where theexchange of the canonical nucleobases by ligands allows for the incorporation of tr ansition metals inside DNA duplexes, thereby imparting a higher stability and conferring unique metal -based properties like magnetism, charge transfer, catalysis, sensing etc. to it,[ 2] has been successfully extended for G -quadruplexes. The folding of oligonucleotide sequences containing covalently incorporated pyridine donors into defined G -quadruplex structures, leads to a pre- arranged ligand environment suitable for binding transition metal ions like Cu (II)or Ni (II). A substantial thermal stabilization of the metal ion -bound secondary structure has been observed, which has been probed by UV/Vis and CD spectroscopy.[ 3]In a recent study, we demonstrated that the system undergoes a metal -induced control in its folding topology and protein binding. [4] Furthermore, the paramagnetic nature of bound Cu( II)ions in G -quadruplex structures has been exploited as EPR -active probe. In the first step, intramolecular Cu -Cu distances were quantified with the help EPR PELDOR and RIDME measurements in struc tures bearing metal pyridine tetrads at both 5 and 3 ends with potential application as EPR -based ruler.[5] This concept is now extended to investigate intermolecular distances in higher -order G -quadruplex structures like dimers (Figure 1), sandwich comp lexes and other adducts with binding ligands e.g. metalloporphyrins .

Small molecules interacting with G4s could possibly interfere and regulate the biological function of G4s. Therefore, a detailed understanding on how th ese small molecules interact with G4s is crucial for binding optimization and selectivity, but very rarely available till date [2, 3]. We applied a combination of several photophysical methods to investigate the interaction between an RNA G4 and two fluore scent Pt(II) complexes. With fluorescence lifetime and dynamic fluorescence anisotropy studies, the binding stoichiometry and binding affinity between the metal complexes and the RNA G4 were successfully determined. Indicated by fundamental anisotropy, we unexpectedly observed a 'planar -to-tetrahedral' conformational change for the Pt(II) complexes upon binding to the RNA G4. The binding is also confirmed by induced chirality to the complexes. Combination with MS data, we confirmed that two binding sites ex ist on the RNA G4 with different affinities for the Pt(II) complexes. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first study on the interaction between RNA G4 and metal complexes. These findings thus provide insights into the rational design for small molecules as RNA G4 binders. Furthermore, the photophysical methods used here have shown an extremely high sensitivity and informative on binding strength, stoichiometry, dynamics and associated structural changes, having thus fundamental implications for further studies of such systems.

In this work we present for the first time a systematic x ray emission spec troscopy study done on a second row transition metal (Molybdenum) and a comprehensive analysis of the origins of the transitions that gives intensity to this region of the spectrum. Transition metal (TM) K -edge X -rayabsorption spectroscopy (XAS)1,2has been extensively used for the study of metal sites in the bioinorganic chemistry field as they can probe lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, providing hence information of the geometric and electronic structure of several metalloenzymes (i.e. XAS on MMOQ)3and small molecules complexes with great success. X ray emission spectroscopy (XES) in the so -called valence- to-core region4(VtC) provides informati on about the highest occupied electronic levels and can serve as a direct probe of ligand ionization potentials. While VtC XES has demonstrated being tremendously useful4, capable of giving metal -ligand information, in some cases also overcoming the EXAFS limitations, the studies are only limited to the first row of transition metal. W e present the first systematic XES study done on a second row transition metal: Molybdenum .The importance of Mo in catalytic processes motivates interest in selective spectroscopic probes of Mo. Mo K -edge XAS has had a significant impact on our understanding of the geometr ic and electronic structure of Mo -containing active sites (i.e. Nitrogenase), however Mo K XES has yet to be explored in bioinorganic chemistry. The presence and identity of the central atom in Nitrogenase Fe -Mo cofactor was found to be a Carbon atom via Fe valence -to-core XES5.We propose the use of Mo XES technique to achieve similar important findings about the identity of ligands on Mo centers in several metalloenzymes . Therefore, t he applications of the technique have been explored in synthetic Mo -Fe cubane clusters as effective models for investigations in MoFe protein (with regard to metrical parameters, distribution of oxidation states, and hete rometal bonding )as a practical example of the efficiency of this technique for elucidating the nature of not only Mo but also any other 2nd row TM center in biological systems. In addition to this project, K Resonant XES (RXES)6was also measured. In these measurements the core hole - l i f e t i m e i s n o w d e p e n d i n g o n t h e R I X S s t a t e f o r t h e K R e s o n a n t X E S , r e v e a l i n g h i d d e n features in the non -resonant XES spectrum .DFT calculations are also on process and would be coupled with the experimental data(Resonant and Non Resonant XES) for a better understanding of the origin of the transitions than give shape to the valence to core spectra in TM in the second row.

First, SMPUs are non-toxic and biocompatible, which makes them suitable for usage inside the human body. Second, the shape of SMPUs can be controlled by t emperature. The weight ratio of SMP to plasticizer used to prepare the gel film was adjusted from 1:0.30, 1:0.50 (S-10DBA, S -30DBA, S smaller with increasing amount of plasticizer content. Furthermore, strain of gels found to be improved. Therefore, the softness of SMP film has been enhanced. As the expected application of SMPU would be potential for self -healing bandage. The glass transition temperature (Tg) was investigated by Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) from -20 to 100 \u00b0C. After filling plasticizer, Tg of gels could be switched from 65 C to 39 \u00b0 C.

Laurent.sabater@lcc -toulouse.fr The Zinc isotope composition in brain tissue from healthy mice tends to become lighter with aging, whereas the effect is significantly less obvious with transgenic mice affected by the Alzheimer disease (AD) [1]. There is thus a Zn isotopic signature potentiall y marking this disease in mice brain. Although interesting, this global approach makes it difficult to understand the exact molecular mechanism responsible for such Zn isotope dynamics. We therefore investigated this isotopic effect at the molecular scale to understand the biochemical reactions at play. Amyloid Beta (A )is a peptide ranging from 40 to 42 amino acids ,coming from the degradation of the Amyloid Protein Precursor. The aggregation of A 40-42 leads to plaques in the brain of AD patients. Transition metals such as Zn and Cu are involved in this aggregation process, but the exact origin of these metals and the exact chemical reactions involved remain obscure [2]. We have conducted aggregation experiments on A28peptides, a shorter form of A 40keeping the coordination and aggregation ability of the full peptide ,in the presence of Zn. Experiments were ran using different ratio of Zinc/A and with the presence or not of different amino acids with different functional groups (including Histidi ne, Glutamate and Cysteine ).Aggregation was monitored by fluorescence when it d idnotevolve anymore, fibrils and supernatant wereseparated and Zinc concentration analysis were performed after the mineralization process. It reveals different distributions of Zinc between aggregated and supernatant depending on the nature and the amount of the amino acid added. Subsequent Zn purification and isotopic analyses by MC -ICP-MS revealed 66Zn between peptide and supernatant ranging from nil to ~0.4. These preliminary results illustrate that 66Zncan inform on the Zn coordination chemistry at play during A aggregation.

B (DFOB) is a hydroxamic acid -based bacterial metabolite essential in guaranteeing cellular iron supply. DFOB is a linear ligan dwhich forms stable hexacoordinate, octahedral with Fe(III) through three bidentate hydroxamic acid fu nctional groups. The exquisite affinity for Fe(III) indicated the clinical use of DFOB as a scavenger for excess iron in patients with transfusion -dependent haemoglobin disorders. The potential clinical utility of DFOB is under scrutiny ,which warrants fur ther study into new DFOB analogues with new properties and function. Studies have used biological and semisynthetic approaches to produce analogues of DFOB ,with other work focusing on total synthesis [1,2,3]. The proposed synthesis in the current work ispredicated on the trimer icstructure of DFOB consisting of one monomeric unit A linked to two monomeric unit Bs. Synthesis of native and ether containing monomeric units A and B allowed for the production of a suite of eight analogues of DFOB, including native DFOB, with ether subunits inserted into positions 1 and/or 2 and/or 3. These constitutional isomers are predicted to co -elute with the compounds generated in our group using biosynthetic methods. The proposed synthetic scheme is highly flexible and c an be adapted to produce various structural analogues. The synthetic route provides access to trihydroxamic acid adducts as well as dihydroxamic acid and other analogues. Improved access to structural variety may reveal nuances in the relationship between DFOB structure and properties that may inspire further therapeutic use.

The Chemistry of compounds containing Transition metals bound to sulfur ligands has been actively studied. Interest in these compounds arises from the identification of the biological importance of Iron - sulfur containing proteins as well as the unusual behaviour of several types of synthetic metal -sulfur complexes. Molybdenum multinu clear Complexes of Bioinorganic relevance were investigated. The complexes [M(M'S 4)2]2-were prepared with high yield and purity as salts of the variety of organic cations. The diamagnetism and spectroscopic properties of these complexes confirmed that their structures are essentially equivalent with two bidentate M'S 42-ligands coordinated to the central d8metal in a square planar geometry. The interaction of the complexes with CT -DNA was studied. Results showed that metal complexes increased DNA's relati ve viscosity and quenched the fluorescence intensity of EB bound to DNA. In antimicrobial activities all complexes showed good antimicrobial activity higher than the ligand s against gram positive, gram negative bacteria and Fungi. The antitumor properties have been tested in vitro against two tumor human cell lines, Hela (derived from cervical cancer) and MCF -7 (derived from breast cancer) using a metabolic activity test. Result sshowed that the complexes are promising chemotherapeutic alternatives in the s earch of anticancer agents.

Bioorthogonal reactions, serving as a powerful technique to dissect native biological processes, have been a thriving research area in recent years .Currently, there a re generally four different types of well - defined reactions with excellent biocompatibility in the repertoire of bioorthogonal chemistry: ligation reaction, cleavage reaction, transfer hydrogenation, and These reactions have extremely expa nded our toolkit to enable an array of exciting new biological applications ranging from biomolecule labeling, metabolite detection and intracellular probe release, to in situ enzyme and prodrug activation. However, there is a highly formidable challenge i n developing or discovering novel and efficient bioorthogonal reaction due to the interference of complex cellular environment [1, 2,3].Here we highlight three well -developed reactions under physiological conditions all of which are promising to involve as bioorthogonal reaction, Ruarene Schiff -base (RAS) oxidation via molecular oxygen as oxidant and finally novel click ligation reaction inspired by native chemical ligation [5].
