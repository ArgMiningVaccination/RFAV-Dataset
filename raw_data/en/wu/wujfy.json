To protect against the risk of importation and transmission of yellow fever in Singapore, all travellers, including Singapore residents, with travel history to countries with risk of yellow fever transmission (regardless of area, city or region) in the six days prior to arrival in Singapore are required to have a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate and present it to the ICA officer at the immigration counter upon arriving in Singapore. The International Certificate of Vaccination for yellow fever becomes valid 10 days after vaccination and the validity lasts for the life of the person vaccinated. Travellers without a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate (e.g. unvaccinated individuals, including those who are ineligible to receive the vaccination such as children aged 1 year old and below and individuals with contraindications, and travellers whose certificate has yet to become valid), are liable to be quarantined under Section 31 of the Infectious Disease Act, for six days from date of departure from countries with risk of yellow fever transmission. The period of quarantine is to cover the incubation period for yellow fever (i.e., six days). For travellers whose vaccination certificate has yet to become valid upon arrival in Singapore, they will still be required to complete the quarantine even if the vaccination certificate subsequently becomes valid during quarantine. This is because they would not have been fully protected against yellow fever during their time in affected countries and may already be infected and incubating the infection. Quarantine must be served at designated vector-free government quarantine facility. Non-residents who refuse quarantine will be denied entry into Singapore.
