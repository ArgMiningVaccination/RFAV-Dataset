In this effort, the United Nations through its enhanced harmonization and coordination among various UN agencies at the country level plays an essential rol e. The United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) constitutes an important platform for the United Nations Country Team to help the Government realize its goals set forth in its national socio -economic development plans and poverty eradication strategy. This UNDAF (2007 -2011) has been developed in an inclusive and participatory manner and based on the in -depth analyses of the Common Country Assessment (CCA) 2005 in the Lao PDR as well as the Mid -Term Review of UNDAF 2002 -2006 with a view to en hancing its significance and effectiveness. Furthermore, this document focuses on the development priority areas identified in the Country's sixth five -year National Socio -Economic Development Plan 2006 - 2010 (NSEDP) and set out clear objectives to be attai ned in the implementation process. This UNDAF is also signficant for the Lao PDR in that it represents UN Country Team commitment towards the UN program of reform, and the simplifcation, harmonization, and alignment of the UN system. For the first time, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and World Food Programme (WFP) will prepare their country programmes stemming directly from this strategic framework, some with common funding cycles and joint programmes. These country programmes will be the strategic instruments to deliver the UNDAF. The document has been a result of a joint and concerted effort by the UN system and the Government and represents our cooperat ion and commitments to eliminate poverty and improve the livelihood of Lao people. The full and effective implementation of this UNDAF would help ensure the attainment of the sixth five -year National Socio -Economic Development Plan (2006 - 2010). In this co ntext, w e would like to extend our appreciation to all both the UN country team and the Government agencies for the inputs and contribution they have made to this UNDAF. We are committed to a strong cooperation and greater partnership between the UN, the G overnment and other development partners as we tackle development challenges and work towards the realization of our national development goals.

It provides a collective, coherent, and integrated United Nations response to national needs and priorities, including enhancing national capacit y and ownership to implement national development priorities as outlined in the Government's five -year National Socio -Economic Development Plan 2006 -2010 (NSEDP), the Common Country Assessment (CCA), and are in pursuit of reaching the Millennium Developmen t Goals (MDGs). In the Lao PDR the UNDAF is organized around three core pillars of governance, poverty and food security, and the social sector. These were identified by the UN system in 2004 as being criticial sectors for the Lao PDR to reach the MDGs a nd as such formed a realignment of UNDAF 1 (2002 -2006) during its mid -term review. The three outcome areas are: 1. By 2011, the livelihoods of poor, vulnerable and food insecure populations are enhanced through sustainable development; 2. By 2011, increased and more equitable access to and utilization of quality and prioritized social services; and 3. By 2011, strengthened capacities of public and private institutions to fulfill their duties and greater people's participation in governance and advocacy for the promotion of human rights in conformity with the Millennium Declaration. These broad expected outcomes are then elaborated by specific outputs under each core area, and will be measured by clear indicators specified in the monitoring and evaluation matri x. In each of these areas, the inputs of the UN system are part of the broader development assistance with a focus on the implementation of the NSEDP led by the Government in cooperation with its full complement of partners. The purpose of the UNDAF approa ch is to focus the UN around its \"value added\" or \"UN niche\". In this regard, it is important to recognise the critical role of other partners in the priority sectors. In relation to poverty reduction the UNDAF centers on a number of key areas that inclu de pro - poor policy reform, support to natural resource development and the environment, clearance of unexploded ordnance (UXO), nutrition and household food security, reproductive health, disaster management, promotion of trade and private sector developme nt, and strengthening of donor and aid coordination and alignment. These are seen as critical components of the poverty reduction framework. In the social sector, key dimensions of the UNDAF aim to increase access to quality primary education for girls a nd children from rural communities, integrate maternal and child health services, increase water and sanitation services and improve communicable disease control, and increase HIV and AIDS coverage of prevention and support. The governance sector focuses on greater people's participation, increased access to justice and strengthened rule of law, improving public administration, and the realization of international treaty obligations in accordance with the Lao Constitution and the Millennium Declaration. In each of these core areas, the UN system notes the specific needs of women, children, young people, and vulnerable groups, particularly in rural areas. The total resources allocated for this UNDAF are USD$219,350,310. This includes staffing and overhea d costs that UN agencies estimate are necessary to deliver the specified outputs, but does not include the resource estimates of the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. United Nations Development Assistance Framework for the Lao PDR (2007 -2011) 6 Millennium Developmen t Goals National Development Goals CCA Common Country Assessment UNDAF UN Development Assistance Framework Individual Agency Country Programmes CPDs and CPAPs Introduction In 2005 the UN system in cooperation with the Government of the La o PDR, undertook a Common Country Assessment, and identified major development challenges faced by the country and their root causes. In doing so, the CCA indicates who are the most vulnerable, disaggregating where possible to capture the extent and locati on of need, and highlights gaps in capacity at various levels. This analysis was then used by the joint UN system and Government theme groups (and other partners) to define this strategic cooperation framework for the five-year period 2007 -2011. The ulti mate goal of both the CCA and the UNDAF is to support the Lao PDR towards: Realizing the values of the Millennium Declaration, Achieving the MDG's by 2015, Reaching national development goals and strategies and, ultimately Exiting Least Developed Country Status by 2020. Preparation Process A mid -term review of the first UNDAF (2002 -2006) recommended focusing on three core areas of assistance during the remainder of the current UNDAF cycle (to the end of 2006). Health, education, and HIV and AIDS were cho sen, primarily as being critical to the Lao PDR achieving the MDGs. In early 2005, in consideration of prioritizing areas for assistance within the new UNDAF model, the UNCT then identified two additional priority areas - poverty and food security, and gov ernance, with gender as a cross -cutting theme. An UNDAF retreat was held in mid 2005 which brought together representatives from Government, the UN system and key partners, to begin the process of prioritizing the core elements of the UNDAF. The results of this retreat then fed into the work of the joint Government and UN system theme groups, created for each of the five priority sectors, and were supported by three cross -cutting working groups. The UN theme groups were reconstituted to form the Common Co untry Assessment analysis and drafting process, and further, to define the results and monitoring and evaluation frameworks for the UNDAF. Role of Stakeholders Theme groups and working groups were comprised of Government officials in technical areas, and senior UN programme staff. The Office of the Resident Coordinator and the Department of International Organizations in Ministry of Foreign Affairs provided the overall coordination and facilitation of the process. External partners including donors and in ternational non -government organizations were invited to participate on the theme groups for both the preparation of the CCA and the UNDAF. Rationale The analysis undertaken through the CCA process highlighted some common areas and challenges for develop ment progress in the Lao PDR. These include fostering enabling environments and increasing awareness; reviewing or building policy and increasing participation; overcoming capacity restraints such as limited financial resources and insufficient monitoring and evaluation; strengthening human resource capacity; and strengthening the implementation and enforcement of policies. United Nations Development Assistance Framework for the Lao PDR (2007 -2011) 7 Furthermore, the MDGs and the Millennium Declaration provided the guiding context in the analysis that constituted the CCA, and the d evelopment of the UNDAF. The principles of the Millennium Declaration are that development is not limited to economic freedom and poverty reduction alone, and that we must strive together to foster an enabling environment of participation, equality, divers ity, and governance, if true progress in human development is to be made. Consultation with the Government and participation at the Round Table Meetings ensured dialogue between the UN system and the Government on priority setting. The resulting prior ity sectors of the UNDAF are thus defined from the CCA analysis, through consideration of the expected inputs of others (including the Government, other Lao stakeholders, other partners in development, INGOs and the foreign private sector) and the comparat ive advantages of the UN system agencies. Data Availability of data is considered a major constraint in policymaking and progress monitoring in the Lao PDR. Data disaggregation by sex, location and ethnicity is improving but does not yet support adequate analysis and policy formulation. The CCA notes the data constraints, and also acknowledges the excellent leadership of the National Statistics Centre (NSC) in improving the quantity and quality of data. At the time of drafting this UNDAF, the results of th e 2005 population census were just being made available, thus every effort to include the latest statistics has been made. Expected Results The development strategy for the Lao PDR is defined in the sixth National Socio -Economic Development Plan 2006 -2010 (NSEDP) launched to international partners at the mini Round Table Meeting in Vientiane in January 2006. The NSEDP has incorporated the previous National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy1 (NGPES), and prescribes the core development priorities fo r the country. The overall direction for the NSEDP centres on transforming the multisectoral economy from uneven performance to fast and stable development within the market mechanism guided by the State. This objective is underpinned by a strong focus o n promoting economic development, increasing competitiveness and effectively implementing international economic commitments (in the framework of ASEAN and other bilateral and multilateral commitments, such as the World Trade Organization accession) and st rengthening the positive links between economic growth and social development to support socio -political stability. Within this core focus of promoting poverty reduction through economic growth, trade, job creation and regional integration, the NSEDP also highlights thematic and cross cutting issues in the areas of gender equality, drug control, UXO, HIV and AIDS, governance, natural resources and the environment, private sector development, particularly micro, small and medium enterprise development, and science and technology. The UN Country Team has ensured that the new UNDAF is directly complementary to the NSEDP. A map showing the 47 poorest districts and 25 poor districts of the Lao PDR, as defined in the NGPES, is included for reference in the ann ex, in order to demonstrate the areas of greatest need. 1 also known as the localized Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) United Nations Development Assistance Framework for the Lao PDR (2007 -2011) 8 UNDAF Outcomes As part of its mid -term review of UNDAF 1 and in consideration of the NSEDP and MDG priority sectors, the UNCT identified five core areas to be addressed in UNDAF 2: governance, health, education, HIV and AIDS, and poverty/ food security /and growth. The following matrices for results, and monitoring and evaluation, have been elaborated in close partnership with the national authorities in response to the strategies, policies and pr iorities of the Lao PDR. Doing so has harmonized the UN vision for sustainable development with the vision of the Government of Lao PDR for its people. UNDAF Outcome 1: By 2011, the livelihoods of poor, vulnerable and food insecure populations are enhan ced through sustainable development (within the MDG framework) Tackling poverty eradication requires a multifaceted approach and the provision of an enabling environment for growth and development. Over recent years, the Lao PDR has experienced periods of economic growth and made encouraging development gains. However, as in many other parts of the world, poverty in the Lao PDR is exacerbated by growing imbalance, particularly between rural and urban areas. Likewise, pockets of food insecurity remain. In addition, gender disparities and rapid population growth continue to exist. The results of the 2005 population census show that the population growth rate is 2.1 percent (considering births, deaths and migration) and that the natural growth rate is 2.5 pe rcent (considering births and deaths), which continue to be one of the highest in the region. Recognizing the sectoral inter -linkages in poverty reduction efforts, this core area of the UNDAF attempts to tackle a broad range of issues including pro -poor policy reform, support to natural resource development and the environment, clearance of unexploded ordnance (UXO), nutrition and household food security, reproductive health, disaster management, promotion of trade and private sector, particularly micro, small and medium enterprise development, and strengthening of donor and aid coordination and alignment. Expected Country Programme Outcomes in the area of Poverty, Food Security and Livelihoods: 1.1 Improved and equitable access to land (between men and women) markets and social and economic services, environmentally sustainable utilization of natural resources, with balanced population growth; 1.2 Increased and more diversified agricultural production, and sustainable use of non -timber forest products ; 1.3 Improved household food security; 1.4 Enhanced ownership and capacity for pro -poor planning and implementation, harmonized aid coordination, and disaster management; and 1.5 Enabled environment for growth with equity. The UN system has identifi ed a number of key issues through the CCA process as follows. Data Quality and Monitoring: improving national capacity in data collection, research, and analysis and use of data; and ensuring quality of disaggregated data and projections for improved poverty planning and monitoring. Policy Formulation and Implementation: improving national capacity to implement multi - sectoral programmes in linking equitable economic growth, population and reproductive health, nutrition, and poverty reduction issues; sup porting sustainable diverse livelihoods that enhance resilience to shocks such as droughts and floods and increase household -level access to adequate food; ensuring the formulation of appropriate policies and incentives to promote sustainable, United Nations Development Assistance Framework for the Lao PDR (2007 -2011) 9 intensified, and diversified food production and food consumption; increasing agricultural productivity and efficiency as well as more equitable division of labour between men and women, and to make efficient use of labour resources (especially in upland areas) to inc rease agricultural output, conserve agricultural biodiversity and enhance women's empowerment; supporting more efficient, effective and equitable UXO clearance for agricultural production and other development activities in accordance with the ten year UXO national strategic plan; improving implementation of sustainable forestry policies and national obligations under international conventions on environment, environmental impact assessment regulations (for infrastructure and industrial development); and improving the investment climate by the establishment of a regulatory framework for investment and impediments to investment. Public Information and Awareness: increasing awareness of nutrition and food security, reproductive health, and its inter -linkages , including education and information on dietary practices, sound breast -feeding, food storage and preparation, and water, sanitation and health, with a particular focus on the needs of women and children. Regionalization and Globalization: assisting WTO -accession and regional trade negotiations; increasing and improving trade -related infrastructure and enhancing trade facilitation with neighbouring countries in order to promote trade expansion; increasing private sector growth and encouraging export relat ed activities (to take full advantage of regional economic dynamism and the more liberal trade environment). Private Sector Development and Job Creation: outward -looking private sector development in a sustainable manner to increase per capita income, imp rove equal employment opportunities for women and men, and improve the quality of work such as improved working conditions; ensure greater transparency and accountability in decision -making processes to help generate business confidence and higher levels o f equitable economic growth. Financing and Resources: ensuring adequate financial allocation and long -term funding to the priority sectors of the NGPES and NSEDP, promoting gender -responsive budget mechanisms and establishing long -term investment strategi es with particular provision for recurrent costs, promoting and developing financing mechanisms for the environment including enhancing private sector involvement in environmental issues. Community Mobilization: encouraging small -scale and participator y development schemes, supporting rural savings mobilization and credit extension services, ensuring implementation of community health schemes (coverage of iodized salt, vitamin A, de -worming campaigns), promoting women's greater participation and ensurin g cross -sectoral institutional and community participation. Promoting Green Growth: promoting the sustainable use of natural resources and biodiversity to ensure the socio -economic development, poverty eradication and the protection of the environment, an d enhancing local level involvement in resource planning and management. The UN Country Team has prioritized a number of these areas for support in the results matrix. UNDAF Outcome 2 : By 2011, Increased and more equitable access to, and utilization o f, quality and prioritized social services During the last decade the government of Lao PDR has clarified and developed its sectoral policies and plans for health and education and HIV and AIDS, adopting key strategic and planning instruments such as the Health Strategy up to the year 2020, National Strategy and Action Plan on HIV and AIDS, sexually transmitted infection, National Education For All (EFA) Action Plan 2003 -2015 , the Health Master Plan, National Strategy for Environmental Health and Rural Wat er Supply, and the NGPES (which was later merged into the NSEDP). These strategies United Nations Development Assistance Framework for the Lao PDR (2007 -2011) 10 identify the key interventions in the social sectors and their role in combating poverty. Importantly, education and health, as fundamentals for the socioeconomic welfare an d for the development of society, have been re -emphasized in the NSEDP. Expected UNDAF Country Programme Outcomes in the Social Sectors 2.1 Increased and equitable access to quality basic education; 2.2 Improved equity, efficiency and quality of health services with increasing health services coverage with an emphasis on maternal and child health, family planning, nutrition, communicable disease control, and water and sanitation ; and 2.3 Increased coverage of quality HIV and AIDS prevention, treatment, care and supp ort, focusing on the most vulnerable groups (including children) as defined in the national strategy on HIV and AIDS, sexually transmitted infections. Education The Government of Lao PDR considers education a crucial priority and has identified it as one of the four pillars of the poverty reduction strategy. The Government has a vision of implementing compulsory primary education and progressively increasing participation at higher levels with particular emphasis on lower secondary level. Reduction of dis parities related to gender, geographical location and ethnicity is a key concern of the government and its development partners. The UN Country Team appreciates the achievements made in the development of the education sector and stands ready to assist the Government in its efforts towards achieving the MDGs. In line with the MDGs and the vision of the Government of Lao PDR to universalize compulsory primary education, the agreed focus of UN support is on primary education and to follow the Education for All National Plan of Action 2003 -2015 as the guiding policy document. Key issues in the education sector include: Policy: developing and implementing realistic, sector -wide development and planning strategies with strategic expenditure frameworks; enshr ining and ensuring education rights across the sector; supporting the implementation of an equivalency education policy (primary, secondary and vocational); addressing gender and ethnic disparities; addressing rural disadvantages; addressing intake, repeti tion and drop outs; and improving the adequacy and timeliness of teacher and facilitator salaries. Financing and Resources: increasing capital funding, particularly in isolated areas; increasing and sustaining recurrent funding across the sector; providin g high level advocacy to increase local and ODA contributions and coordinating donor support; and improving financial management, accountability and controls. Quality, Monitoring and Evaluation: Strengthening the Education Management Information System (E MIS) and its use in planning and monitoring at all levels; monitoring progress in reaching rural and ethnically diverse students. Service Delivery: improving the quality and supply of students and teachers' materials; improving the relevance and consisten cy of formal and non -formal curriculum; improving the quality and capacity of Community Learning Centers to reach those out of school; improving the relevance and consistency of teacher and facilitator training; increasing the ethnic diversity and gender b alance of teachers ; addressing enrolment, repetition and drop -out at a school level; prioritizing the most remote and marginalized children, youth and adults, both in and out of school settings; and prioritizing gender equality across all education levels. United Nations Development Assistance Framework for the Lao PDR (2007 -2011) 11 Health The health policies of the Government of Lao PDR aim to promote an equitable society through the reduction of urban -rural health gaps, achieving lower maternal and child mortality, reducing health disparities between the poor and those better o ff, and higher living conditions for all Lao people. This recognizes the importance of family planning as a way to improve the health status of women and their families, and in achieving better living standards for communities, especially in the most vulne rable and needy areas. Meeting these goals requires focusing resources into prevention and curative measures for the conditions that feed poverty. Key issues for the health sector include: Service Delivery and Access: Improving the quality of health care services with a focus on service delivery, and emphasis on maternal health, child/newborn health, and communicable disease control, i mproving the coordination and planning of health care services, utilizing both internal and external resources, and improv ing health care access and appropriate utilization of health services for all Lao people. Planning, Financial, and Human Resources: Improving health care financing by moving towards financing systems that emphasize pre -payment, risk pooling and equity in financing, and improving human resources in the areas of quality, distribution, and motivation. Awareness and Promotion: improving health promoting behaviours at all levels. HIV and AIDS The challenge in the Lao PDR is to keep the HIV epidemic at its c urrent low level. This can only happen through an expanded response, including new partnerships, involvement of sectors other than health, and a focus on the most vulnerable groups. The new \"National Strategy and Action Plan on HIV and AIDS, sexually trans mitted infections 2006 -2010\" aims at scaling -up prevention and treatment towards universal access for all in need. The UN system in Lao PDR has identified four areas in which the UN has a comparative advantage to support the government in mounting an effec tive response. These areas comprise: a) coordination, management and implementation capacity, b) involvement of new sectors and new partnerships, c) Support to strategic information and interventions focusing on vulnerable groups including children, You ng People and adults living with HIV and AIDS, and d) strengthening of service delivery in selected geographic areas. The operationalization of the joint UN efforts to respond to HIV and AIDS will also be guided by the recommendations of the Global Task Team on HIV and AIDS, including the UNAIDS division of labour and the establishment of a joint UN HIV and AIDS team in Lao PDR, which, within the Resident Coordinator system, and facilitated by the UNAIDS Country Coordinator, will coordinate and monitor th e implementation of UN HIV and AIDS related activities. Financing and Resources: developing and costing a multi -year operational framework including yearly national programs with clear strategies and targets, moving from individual funded projects to resu lt oriented program funding, and improving national reporting and accountability. Leadership and Commitment: increasing, sustaining and broadening political commitment and leadership at all levels and including HIV and AIDS related activities into nation al development plans; increasing resource allocation, including new partners and stake -holders, actively engaging ministries and national authorities outside of the health sector, translating commitment into meaningful institutional mechanisms that can lea d and coordinate an expanded national response, committing to a rights based response, involvement and inclusion of people living with HIV and AIDS, choosing supportive strategies rather than punitive approaches, addressing denial, stigma and discriminatio n, and providing an enabling environment and targeted interventions. United Nations Development Assistance Framework for the Lao PDR (2007 -2011) 12 National Responses: rapidly scaling -up the response of well -prioritized and targeted interventions focusing on the most vulnerable and marginalized groups, improving the quality of interventions, establishing an effective system to track the epidemic, and to monitor and evaluate the response and impact, building capacity at all levels, establishing an effective and functioning national coordination mechanism, including the target populat ion in all stages of the response, involving and including people living with HIV and AIDS, expanding the coverage of treatment services, facilitating access to the means of protection (i.e. condoms, clean injecting equipment), and integrating HIV and AIDS prevention (including voluntary testing and counselling, and prevention of mother to child transmission) and care activities into other nationwide systems (e.g. education, uniformed services). The UN Country Team has prioritized a number of these educati on, health and HIV and AIDS key areas for support in the results matrix. UNDAF Outcome 3: By 2011, strengthened capacities of public and private institutions to fulfill their duties and greater people's participation in governance and advocacy for the promotion of human rights in conformity with the Millennium Declaration Governance is a vehicle through which individuals, institutions, rules and political processes may contribute to economic growth, the realization of rights and the alleviation of pove rty. In the Lao context this may be directly linked to achieving the MDGs. If realization of the MDGs is viewed as the desired outcome , good governance is central to the process by which such outcomes are derived. Poverty reduction is directly linked to g overnance in that limited public resources must be used effectively and efficiently to reach out to the poor. Importantly, in the transition to a more market -based economy, the system of decision -making must be more community -based, transparent and accoun table. For the past decade, the Government of the Lao PDR has embarked on wide -ranging public administration reforms, designed to create an effective, efficient and low - cost public administration, together with the requisite institutional and legal framew ork. The UN system is committed to supporting initiatives to ensure more efficient, accountable, transparent, policies and practices to protect the rights of citizens, especially the poorest and most vulnerable. In 2003, the government presented a policy paper on governance at the Round Table Meeting, indicating its intention to pursue an ambitious reform agenda in this area. The policy paper provides a comprehensive overview of major governance activities including the four themes of public service reform , people's participation, the rule of law and sound financial management. These priority areas form the basis of the UN system's pillars of support in the UNDAF. Expected UNDAF Country Programme Outcomes in Governance 3.1 Greater people's and community participation in and contribution to public policy, local development and nation building; 3.2 Increased and more equitable access to justice and strengthened rule of law; 3.3 Increased efficiency, effectiveness, transparency, and accountability of the public administration at both central and local levels; and 3.4 Progressive realization of international treaty obligations, including protection of human rights, in accordance with the Lao Constitution and the Millennium Declaration. The main governance issues to be addressed through the UNDAF may be summarized as follows: Civil Society Participation : promoting the wider participation of citizens in the review of public policy and as partners in development. United Nations Development Assistance Framework for the Lao PDR (2007 -2011) 13 Legislature and the Rule of Law: increasing the number and capacity of judges, lawyers and prosecutors; increasing public awareness and understanding of the legal system and pro -actively encouraging the development of the legal profession; promoting gender -balance in the legal sector, increasing equ ity in legal services access and improve the clarity of laws to ease implementation; improving enforcement legislation to maximize the effectiveness of existing laws and to develop a master plan for the legal sector in Lao PDR. Public Administration and Decentralization: technical awareness and resource capacity to implement change; supporting the administrative decentralisation of public sector functions to enhance responsiveness and decision making at central, provincial, district, and village levels; improving management skills and administrative capacity in public organizations; continuing to tackle corruption and appropriate legislation; and continuing to promote the representation and capacity of women in the public sector. Human Rights: ensuring na tional laws are consistent with the obligations under international treaties which Lao PDR has committed to and to provide support to the Government with the expertise and resources to realize human rights; promoting awareness of rights among Lao people and enhancing the capacity and effectiveness of mechanisms for investigation and redress of alleged human rights issues ; celebrating progress and successes in recent human rights advances. The UN Country Team has prioritized a number of these Governance a reas for support in the results matrix. UNDAF Implementation The UN Country Team, under the leadership of the Resident Coordinator, is responsible for the implementation of the UNDAF, in partnership with the Government. Many of the strategies detailed in the Results Matrix (annex) will be absorbed into UN agencies existing country programmes, and importantly, as a key instrument of the UN reform process, the programmes of the EXCOM agencies (UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA and WFP) are required to show direct contribution to UNDAF outcomes. Joint Programming Effective implementation of the UNDAF will require greater harmonization among UN agencies as the UNCT moves towards greater synergy and alignment in pursuit of the UN programme of reform. The UNDAF prioritiz ation and planning exercises have created unique opportunities for the UN system to identify areas to join together in more effective design and delivery of programmes at the country level. A number of joint programmes have already been identified, and it is expected that many more will emerge as the UNCT strives towards more cost -effective and efficient coordination and programming focused on greater impact. Some of these prospective areas for joint programming include i ntegrated maternal and child health, education, strengthening of statistical capacity, gender, HIV and AIDS, trade, governance, food security, and private sector development. Partnerships The UNDAF also provides a strategic framework for the UN system to articulate its partnerships with a r ange of stakeholders. In addition to traditional partners in the Lao PDR, the UNDAF has articulated the emergence of new partnership opportunities such as the private sector and emerging civil society organizations, representing exciting developments for d evelopment interventions. Role of Specialized Agencies and IFIs Although the UNDAF primarily represents 80 percent of the substantive programmes of the four EXCOM agencies, the UN system as a whole is focused through the results framework and monitoring a nd evaluation matrix. The UN system in the Lao PDR is strongly committed to United Nations Development Assistance Framework for the Lao PDR (2007 -2011) 14 presenting a unified and coordinated approach, while respecting the specific mandates of specialized agencies and the unique role of the International Finance Institutions. In part icular, the IFIs are regular and substantive members of the UN Country Team and their country strategies form part of the total picture of UN assistance. The detailed country programmes of specialized agencies and the IFIs are annexed to the UNDAF. It sho uld be noted that although the UNDAF is presenting areas of proposed intervention, actual execution of such activities is dependent upon funds being mobilized, which for specialized agencies, cannot be known with certainty at the time of signature. Coordination Modalities A range of coordination mechanisms exist and will continue to drive the delivery of UNDAF outcomes and to promote an enabling environment of dialogue, feedback, and review towards greater results. Specific coordination modalities inc lude: UN Country Team to act as the overall quality control and monitoring mechanism of the UNDAF; UNDAF Theme Groups (joint Government and UN system) to monitor the implementation of the UNDAF and make recommendations for adjustment where necessary; Informal Quarterly Donor Coordination Meetings and Sectoral Working Groups (donor and government) to ensure dialogue with partners on development issues and to identify areas for joint programming and to avoid duplication; and UN System Administration Officers group to promote greater efficiency and cost effectiveness. Estimated Resource Requirements The total resources to be mobilized in support of UNDAF implementation for the period 2007 - 2011 are estimated at approximately USD$ 190,638,790 . This total inclu des resources that form part of the core funding of UN agencies operating in the Lao PDR as well as funds to be mobilized through external partners2. Of this total amount, it is estimated that USD$83,223,880 (44%) will be allocated on poverty, food secu rity and growth initiatives, USD$71,945,000 (38%) on the social sector, and USD $34,384,910 (18%) will be spent on governance. This distribution reflects national development priorities. More detail on the amount to be realized for each UNDAF outcome area may be found in the UNDAF results matrix. The resource framework of the UNDAF is indicative only, and each UN agency is responsible for financial planning, management and resource mobilization, specific to their country programmes. However for the first t ime, this UNDAF provides a guiding framework for joint programming and a number of areas have been identified where the UN system can share resources and thus increase impact. 2 Note, this does not include resource estimates of WB and ADB UNDAF Budget Allocation by Sector Social Sector (Health, Education, HIV/AIDS) $71,945,000 38%Governance $34,384,910 18% Poverty, Food Security & Growth $83,223,880 44%Resource Allocation by UN Agency: UN Agency Total $190,638,790 Staffing and Overhead Cost estimated by UN Agency (for UNDAF period 2007 -2011): UN Agency these estimates are not included in programme costs in the results matrix nor in resource allocation table le ft, but are additional costs to the UN agencies and organizations in order to deliver the UNDAF Monitoring and Evaluation The UN Country Team and Government joint theme groups have worked together to define a series of realistic indicators to measure r esults for each UNDAF outcome, in the monitoring and evaluation matrix (annex). The UN Country Team will assume overall monitoring responsibility for the UNDAF and this will form a major part its annual work plans. Substantive support will be provided by t he UNDAF theme groups as their role is expanded to include a monitoring function. Availability of data is considered a major constraint in policy making and progress monitoring in the Lao PDR. Data disaggregation by sex, location and ethnicity is improvi ng but does not yet support adequate analysis and policy formulation. The data collection carried out as part of the MDG reporting process in 2003 and 2004 highlighted a number of data gaps that remain unaddressed. There are a range of reasons for the data constraints including poor coordination between line ministries and agencies and between donors and development partners on data collection and analysis efforts. In addition, the Government lacks the human resources and financial capacity to undertake dat a collection, analysis and reporting. At this stage the decree on statistics is yet to be adequately implemented. Data collection and analysis requires continued and consistent financial and institutional support from international partners. A number of initiatives have been put in place to strengthen data management capacity in the Lao PDR, linked to strengthening monitoring and reporting capacity. The National Statistics Centre is being supported to improve data collection, and line ministries are bein g supported to enhance their collection of primary data. Lao -Info (a localized version of DevInfo software) was introduced in November 2005, and this will provide significantly enhanced data management capacity for monitoring indicators at the outcome and impact level in the Lao PDR, including the UNDAF, as well as the NGPES, ASEAN indicators, the MDGs, the National Human Development Report, and other Government reporting needs. I n consideration of strengthening data management capabilities in the future, i t will be important for the UN in conjunction with its partners, to continue to explore ways to align and streamline efforts in data gathering and analysis with national systems and processes. * Please note that the UNDP core resources shown are indicative only. These exclud e other UNDP resources such as TRAC 2 (additional funding, especially for the national capacity development for the MDGs), TRAC3 (funding for emergency relief and rehabilitation as required), and thematic trust funds.

a \"work in progress\". The lack of available and quality data at the time of finalization of the UNDAF has meant that not all outputs can be quantified. Furthermore, intensive discussions around joint programming are also underway which will help determine realistic targets by sector and not by agency, while a range of surveys are due to be completed towards the end of 2006 that will provide valuable baselines from which to set specific targets. The UN Country Team also intends to update this M&E matrix on a regular basis to ensure it is a living and relevant tool to track progress.

It is an instrument of coordination an d harmonization as they share common funding and implementation cycles. CPAP - Country Program Action Plan The Country Program Action Plan is the implementation plan of the CPD. It shows how UNDP, UNICEF and UNFPA will deliver their CPD and thus contribu te to the UNDAF. Disaggregated Data Wherever possible, data should be disaggregated by sex, ethnicity, age etc, to ensure as much meaningful information can be obtained, and to enable appropriate policy development as a result of better information. Effectiveness Means the capability of, or success in, achieving a given goal. A measure of the extent to which a specific intervention, procedure, regimen, or service, when deployed in the field in routine circumstances, does what it is intended to do for a s pecified population.

The present CAS has been designed to support the NGPES, and within same, key drivers of future growth, as well as better targeting of social outcomes and reductions in vulnerability. The Bank's analytical and advisory activities (AAA) program and Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) framework, will provide strategic support for strengthening the dialogue on the reform agenda. This new CAS incorporates a stronger emphasis on building capacity, and its objec tives seek to: 1) sustain growth through improved management of key drivers -regional integration and private sector development, rural development, and natural resource management; 2) improve social outcomes and reduce vulnerability, through strengthened publi c financial management and service delivery capacities, targeting poverty reduction programs; 3) adopt a strategic approach to capacity development and partnerships in support of better NGPES results; 4) support implementation of Nam Theun 2 (NT2) as an exampl e of an area -based, sustainable natural resource development program that contributes to growth, social outcomes, capacity development, and stronger partnerships. Investment operations in selected sectors will support NGPES priorities, and in collaboratio n with other donors, will complement the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) support to private sector development, while emphasizing sector -wide approaches (SWAps) where appropriate. During the first years of the CAS period, International Development Association (IDA) lending/grants will focus on key operations to support the NT2 development framework and associated social and environmental measures. The Bank will also continue to work closely with th e International Monetary Fund (IMF) on issues of macro - economic management and monitoring.

Several Regional and National Projects have been implemented since 2004, including strate gy development for AI Pandemic Preparedness Plan with the Government and the UN Cross -Sectoral Influenza Working Group. United Nations Development Assistance Framework for the Lao PDR (2007 -2011) 47 WHO Biennial Budget 2006 -2007 WHO technical collaboration is focused on communicable disease control, health sector development, human resource development, and health promotion. The core government policies in health are the 'Health Strategy to the Year 2020', the 'Lao Health Master Planning Study', and \"The National Socio -Economic Development Plan\", and the WHO programme works wi thin those frameworks. Technical assistance is a major focus as well as efforts at donor coordination and policy making. There is an increasing emphasis in Lao PDR on maternal and child health as well as an emphasis on improving the quality of health ser vices, not just the quantity. The WHO budget for activities in Laos for the 2006/07 biennium is US$4,170,516. This does not include activities and consultants that are funded from the regional or HQ budget. Additional funds will be raised during the bi ennium. Core components of the WHO programme for the 2 year period are Immunization and vaccine development, Vectorborne and parasitic disease control, Malaria, Tuberculosis, HIV and AIDS, Communicable disease prevention and control, Food safety, Health pr omotion, Health and environment, Child and adolescent health, Making pregnancy safer, Mental health and substance abuse, Non -communicable disease control, Tobacco control, Health financing and social protection, Health system policies and service delivery, Essential medicines, Human resources for Health. ILO Decent Work Country Programme 2006 -2010 The 2005 World Summit Outcome Document stated that \"the goals of full and productive employment and decent work for all...a central objective of our relevant n ational and international policies as well as national development strategies, including poverty reduction strategies, as part of our efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals\". The overall goal of the International Labour Organization is to prom ote opportunities for decent work for women and men in all countries. The ILO provides technical and institutional assistance to Lao PDR to meet that goal. The primary means for the ILO to provide such assistance are the Decent Work Country Programme (DWCP ). Decent work concept calls for the integration of economic and social objectives and for a well -orchestrated combination of measures in the areas of employment promotion, rights at work, social protection and social dialogue. This coherent approach is proving its relevance to a wide -ranging policy agenda, from social dimensions of globalization to poverty reduction strategies. The focus of the decent work programme varies from country to country, reflecting different national priorities and conditions. Taken into account the key priority areas in the NGPES and the NSEDP, the ILO, in consultation with the Government and social partners identified priorities areas, which set the DWCP framework of action for the next four years from 2006 to 2010. The long -term objectives under the DWCP are set as follows: 1. More job opportunities are created for rural poor, youth, people with disabilities and other targeted group resulting in poverty reduction; 2. Further progress is made to realize fundamental principle s and rights at work, and to ratify and apply fundamental ILO Conventions; and 3. Social protection extended to uncovered population. Past and existing ILO activities in the Lao PDR have covered a wide range of labour -related fields from the provision of advisory services, establishment of social security system as well as the system to prevent and tackle the child labour and human trafficking to collection of labour - based data. These are devices that help the country gear towards the identification of ma jor employment and labour issues arising in the course of the country's transition to a market economy. The international labour standards are an integral part of good governance advocacy, the concept of which was officially introduced to the Government wi th the rights -based Common Country Assessment (CCA) in 2005. While some of the workers rights are guaranteed by national laws and adopted international instruments, others have not yet been fully adopted and enforced. There is a need to further raising pub lic awareness of rights. To the effect that the government attaches much importance to the growing of private sector with a hope that the sector can make positive contribution to eradicate poverty, the ILO will continue its endeavour in promoting micro a nd small enterprise development with the government and social partners. The better structured and functioned workers' and employers' organizations, of which its members and staff are equipped with knowledge on the organization's roles and function, wil l be conducive to the healthy social and economic development, thus to achieve the national long -term development goals. The ILO is assisting the capacity build up for workers' and employers' organizations and promoting social dialogue in the country. United Nations Development Assistance Framework for the Lao PDR (2007 -2011) 48 UNODC Strategic Programme Framework 2006 -2009 UNODC 's Strategic Programme Framework for the Lao PDR 2006 - 2009 was formulated in light of the fact that from being the third largest producer of illicit opium in the world, the Lao PDR is close to reach ing its goal of eliminating opium. In the context of UNGASS, opium cultivation has been reduced by 93% over the past seven years. While this is a very significant achievement, external alternative development assistance has reached less than 50% of former opium poppy cultivating communities and there is concern regarding the sustainability of elimination and the impact of elimination on former opium poppy cultivating communities. To address anticipated issues arising in the immediate post -opium setting, UNO DC and the Government of the Lao PDR have drafted a new national programme strategy for the post -opium scenario entitled \" The Balanced Approach to Sustaining Opium Elimination in the Lao PDR \" (2006 -2009). The aim is to integrate the latter with the Lao Nat ional Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES). The Strategic Programme Framework supports the new national programme strategy, which is a national priority, and is being integrated with the UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF), as well as th e Millennium Development Goals. Laos is at a critical juncture. The risk of not providing timely, sufficient, and appropriate assistance could result in the reversal of successes achieved. The possible scenario of opium poppy farmers and addicts revertin g to opium cultivation in order to survive - together with increased cross -border ATS, heroin and human trafficking, leading to corruption and crime - could affect national security and stability that are prerequisites for poverty alleviation and developme nt. Unchecked escalation of such a situation would threaten the development and economy of the region. Drug control has been identified as an important crosscutting issue in the upcoming UN Common Country Assessment for the Lao PDR. The SPF has four strat egic objectives: 1. Support the National Programme Strategy for the Post -Opium Scenario; 2. Reduced opium and ATS abuse, and increased substance abuse and HIV and AIDS awareness; 3. Support to strengthen penal dispositions and penal procedures relating to illicit drug activities, transnational crime, corruption and terrorism. Support to increase public law awareness; and 4. Support to strengthen the capacity of law enforcement officials to fight illicit drug activities, transnational crime, corruption and terrorism. Support to improve the penitentiary system. Support activities to increase awareness on drug and crime issues . UNODC will promote the Government's adherence to the drug, crime and terrorism conventions and protocols, and assist in bringing about a level of technical capability in the Lao PDR to sufficiently meet international standards and protocols. Technical advice and resources will be provided on a targeted basis, ensuring synergy and complementarity with other organizations and bilateral donors, and maximizing the effect of UNODC resources on drugs and crime problems. UNESCO Programme and Budget (33 C/5 Approved) 2006 -2007 The Programme and Budget for 2006 -2007, as approved by its Member States, allows UNESCO to be better equipped to increase its participation in joint United Nations systems activities, especially at the country level. It will seek to bring to bear its core competencies in support of national development priorities in furthering international cooperation. In the process, UNESCO wi ll benefit from synergies and contribute to the United Nations system's agenda of simplification, harmonization and quality enhancement, as outlined by the Paris High -Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness. This will find its expression in a more pronounced and widespread contribution of UNESCO to the preparation of national planning processes and documents aimed at poverty reduction as well as United Nations system programming frameworks such as Common Country Assessment (CCA), United Nations Development Assista nce Frameworks (UNDAF) with their results -based matrixes, and Poverty Reduction Strategies (PRS).
