US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday, May 14, announced people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can forgo their masks and social distancing in many indoor situations. Questions & Answers about COVID-19 vaccines I've already had COVID-19, how long should I wait before getting the vaccine? Doctors say some COVID-19 patients should wait for at least three months before they get the vaccine, while others may not have to wait as long. Even with a wait, they say people who have had COVID-19 should still get a vaccine, because protection from the vaccine is likely more robust. Can I test positive for COVID-19 after receiving the vaccine? The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified a small number of people can get infected with COVID-19 after completing their vaccine series. Approximately 5,800 cases of Covid-19 infection among 66 million Americans who are completely vaccinated, according to the CDC. That represents 0.008% of the fully vaccinated population, but health professionals say most experience mild symptoms. [Health experts encourage people to get vaccinated](https://cbs58.com/news/can-i-test-positive-for-covid-19-after-receiving-the-vaccine) to take precautions as cases remain steady in the state.

What if I skip my second COVID-19 vaccine dose? As more and more people begin the vaccination process, doctors are stressing the importance of finishing the two-dose regimen for people receiving Pfizer or Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine. [Various studies](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577) have shown just one dose of the Pfizer vaccine could have anywhere from 50-percent to more than 80-percent efficacy, but doctors say for now one shot is simply not enough.

Why should I go to the same place for my second COVID-19 vaccine dose? Experts say it's highly recommended people get their second dose at the same location. Doctors say there are two benefits to getting your first and second dose at the same place. The first reason is you'll have the right timing between both doses for the best protection, and second\u2014 you'll get the right vaccine. Pharmacies say getting your second dose at the same location helps with the vaccination supply chain from the federal government and the state. To learn more, [click here](https://www.cbs58.com/news/doctors-recommend-going-to-the-same-place-to-get-your-second-dose-unless-theres-special-circumstances). What if my second COVID-19 vaccine dose is different than the first? The CDC says: The safety and efficacy of a mixed-product series have not been evaluated. Both doses of the series should be completed with the same product. In exceptional situations in which the vaccine product given for the first dose cannot be determined or is no longer available, any available mRNA COVID-19 vaccine may be administered at a minimum interval of 28 days between doses to complete the mRNA COVID-19 vaccination series. In situations where the same mRNA vaccine product is temporarily unavailable, it is preferable to delay the 2nd dose (up to 6 weeks) to receive the same product than to receive a mixed series using a different product.\" More from the CDC can be found [here](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html#Interchangeability). What warning signs should I look for if I received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine? The CDC announced April 13, six women between the ages of 18 and 48 had developed a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) -- a clot in the area of the brain that collects and drains oxygen-depleted blood after receiving the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. When this happens, \"blood cells may break and leak blood into the brain tissues, forming a hemorrhage,\" according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. The women all developed symptoms of this \"rare and severe type of blood clot\" between six and 13 days after their J&J vaccination, the CDC said. If you're a younger woman who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine within a two-week timeframe, there are symptoms you should look out for: abdominal pain, severe headaches, shortness of breath, leg pain or leg swelling that is new. Contact your health care provider if you are experiencing any of these symptoms.
