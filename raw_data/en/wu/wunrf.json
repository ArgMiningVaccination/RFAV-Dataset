Here's what you need to know about the history of Ayurveda and Ayurvedic skin care. What Is Ayurveda? Ayurveda is an [ancient, natural,](https://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/understanding-alternative-medicine) and whole-body system of medicine that began in India more than 3,000 years ago. Ayurvedic medicine is still practiced in India today. The [term Ayurveda](https://www.webmd.com/balance/what-is-ayurveda) means \"knowledge of life,\" so Ayurvedic practice is used to restore life and balance. The system is based on the idea that there are 5 elements that make up 3 key doshas, or life forces of the body. Each person has a dominant dosha that shapes their physical constitution and personality. Disease occurs when there's an imbalance in [the doshas](https://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/what-is-alternative-medicine). This imbalance is caused by lifestyle, diet, stress, exercise, and pollution, which affect the body's activities and lead to disease. Ayurveda treatments include purification, [herbal remedies](https://www.webmd.com/balance/ss/slideshow-home-remedies), diet, [yoga](https://www.webmd.com/balance/ss/slideshow-yoga-health-benefits), meditation, and massage to restore the life force.

You have a dominant, underlying dosha that stays the same throughout your life, but lifestyle, diet, [and pollution](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/ss/slideshow-skin-beauty) can lead to a surge in other doshas. This can lead to skin conditions. Skin, according to the doshas, is: - Vata: [dry, cracked](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/ss/slideshow-dry-skin), cold, ages quickly - Pitta: fair, thin, and sensitive, with a tendency toward acne, moles, and freckles, ages moderately fast - Kapha: normal or oily, clear, smooth, and firm, ages slowly Metabolism. Agni is the digestive fire of your body that turns food into energy and manages all the chemical and [hormone reactions](https://www.webmd.com/women/ss/slideshow-hormone-imbalance) of your body, including your skin. Healthy skin depends on proper metabolism. Circulation. Healthy skin needs [good circulation](https://www.webmd.com/dvt/ss/slideshow-dvt-improve-circulation) of blood and nutrients and proper elimination of wastes and impurities. A buildup of metabolic wastes is called ama, which can clog the skin and lead to problems. Moisture.
