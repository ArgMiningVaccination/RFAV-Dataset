Chronic Problems, Lasting Solutions So often women ask me, \"Dr. Romm, can I ever feel like myself again? How can I feel at home in my body?\" They are filled with doubt because a doctor told them there is no way to overcome their diagnosis, whether it be of fatigue, overweight, depression, an autoimmune condition, diabetes, PCOS, infertility, or one of the myriad other health problems women face. Chronic health problems are keeping women from feeling and achieving their best. Indeed, the statistics are daunting: Autoimmune Disease Autoimmune diseases are now the third most common category of disease in the United States, one of the leading 10 causes of death for women, and at least 78% of autoimmune disease sufferers are women. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most prevalent, affecting almost entirely women. Women in the US are dangerously over medicated and we are also more likely to experience adverse medication reactions than are men. Stress, Poor Sleep, Overwhelm According to the Annual Stress Survey, 75% of women experience moderate to severe stress, 49% report sleep problems, millions take a sleep medication nightly or often, and over 40% of women report physical symptoms as a direct result of stress. Women's health in pregnancy can determine whether the next generation experiences diabetes, allergies, asthma - even autism. For the first time in history, children are expected to have a shorter life-expectancy than their parents and these preventable changes start even before pregnancy. Obesity 34% of adults aged 20 years and over are overweight, 34% are obese, and 6% are extremely obese, with a predicted rate of 50% of adults having diabetes by 2030. Women between the ages of 20 and 60 are much more likely to be overweight than men. Depression and Anxiety 1 in 4 women experiences an extended time of major depression in her life, and one in six women is currently on an antidepressant. Hormone Problems 1 in 6 women struggles with fertility problems, over 10% have PCOS, and millions suffer from endometriosis, fibroids, PMS, disruptive menopausal symptoms, and gynecologic cancers. The top 5 surgeries performed in the US are done for women's gynecologic and obstetric problems; more than half of these are likely unnecessary. You dream of helping these women, and, like me, you believe that your patient's diagnosis does not have to be her destiny. But where do you start and what information can you really trust? You're here because you know there has to a better way. You want to incorporate more of an integrative and functional approach but feel overwhelmed with where to start, the complexity of options, and the increasingly complex health concerns of women seeking your help. The goal of this program is to give you the tools you need to help women take back their hope, their health and with it, their lives. Women do not have to be relegated to chronic symptoms and conditions that are taking away their health - and their quality of life. The most comprehensive online course in women's health that gives you the tools you need to help women take back their health Let's Help Women Thrive! If you're ready to help women feel like themselves again - and even better than ever - then this program is for you. Who should take this course? This course welcomes women who are certified or licensed health professionals committed to life-long learning, a women's health revolution, and making the world a better place! MD's, DO's, ND's, PA's and DC's Nutritionists, and Health Coaches Acupuncturists and Herbalists By a woman, about women, for women What You'll Learn The Total Ecology of Women's Health Health encompasses the totality of a woman's life - as do the factors that lead to disease. In this course you will learn to understand the factors that need to be addressed to help women regain health, balance, and also happiness. Unlike many functional medicine programs that are based less on the individual woman and the content of her life, and more on test results and supplements, this program offers a different perspective, uniquely and fully integrating traditional women's wisdom with the latest critically reviewed scientific evidence for the prevention and treatment of common women's health concerns. This course emphasizes a whole-woman approach to most common and complex daily health concerns the modern woman is facing and experiencing, always taking into consideration body, mind, and the whole context of a woman's life. It takes you on a journey into the physical, emotional and spiritual influences of wellness - and disease. It gives you the tools to systematically approach complex constellations of women's health problems and step out of the overwhelm of trying to figure out where to start and what to do, while offering much more than just symptom management. The Heart Framework It can be overwhelming to where to start with patients, what testing to use, and what nutritional plans and dietary and herbal supplements to incorporate. In this course I work with you to at once have a systematic approach that you can then individualize in your own practice. In this course I share my unique approach called the HEART Framework. Through this model you'll learn how to elicit your patient's story, really hear her, and treat her - not just her disease - and to create a truly effective personalized plan. - H - Hear each woman's story and Hold space for her. - E - Explore underlying contributors to symptoms/conditions with the right intake questions, food journal review, clinical diagnostic tests, and more. - A - Add in missing elements. - R - Remove & Replace triggers, Restore balance. - T - Support Transformation. Women's Root Cause Medicine The human body is not a collection of separate parts. It is a whole organism. What happens in one organ or 'part' impacts the whole. Root Cause Medicine recognizes that being healthy is multifactorial, as is the development of imbalance that leads to dysfunction, syndromes, and eventually disease. With expertise in psychoneuroimmunology and endocrinology, Dr. Romm teaches you how to always take a Root Cause perspective in your approach to women's health. You'll learn to assess for Root Cause factors, and using the Whole 5R system of Rebooting, Reframing, Repairing, and Recharging, you will help women on their way to becoming Replenished. The Root Causes include: Food Triggers & Nutritional Imbalances Stress, Trauma & HPA Axis Dysregulation Toxin Exposure & Detoxification Overload Gut Imbalances Inflammation & Immune Dysregulation Stealth infections Shift the way health care is practiced. In only 10 months you will gain new insights into how the total health ecology of women shape our lives. This course is divided into 2 parts Each clinical lesson contains: If you're ready to be part of the solution, this program is for you. Your patient's diagnosis does not have to be her destiny. This curriculum dives deeply into: This is all in the context of the factors that shape a woman's health or as I call it, the Total Ecology of Women's Health. In this course I work with you to at once have a systematic approach that you can then individualize in your own practice. You'll also learn the heart of healing - the nuances of working with real women who aren't feeling their best. By learning to address the Root Causes of women's health, and through learning specific protocols, you will be able to help women with the following concerns to improve their wellness: Acne Adrenal health Arthritis Autoimmune Diseases Bloating and Gas Brain Fog and Brainflammation Breast health Cancer Prevention Cholesterol problems Chronic Fatigue Constipation Cyclic breast pain and lumps Depression and Anxiety Detoxification Digestive Problems Dysbiosis Eating disorders Eczema Endometriosis Environmental toxicity Fatigue Fertility challenges Fibroids Fibromyalgia GERD Hashimoto's Thyroiditis High Blood Pressure Hormonal imbalances Hot flashes Inflammatory Bowel Disease Inflamm-Aging Insomnia Insulin resistance/metabolic syndrome Irregular or painful periods Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) Leaky Gut Low libido Menopause Menstrual problems Metabolic Syndrome Migraines and Headaches Osteoporosis/Osteopenia Pelvic pain PMS Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) Post-pill hormonal problems Pre-Diabetes and Type 2 Diabetes Rheumatoid Arthritis Sexual health & Low Libido Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth Sleep problems Thyroid Disorders Urinary Tract infections Vaginal dryness Vaginal infections Varicose Veins Weight & Body Image Issues Weight loss Each clinical lesson teaches step-by-step approaches and protocols that you can incorporate into your practice, whether implementing them from the perspective of a licensed medical/health professional, or supporting your client as a nutritionist or health coach.

Busy? Don't worry, I've got your back. The structure of this program is based on the knowledge that you are a busy woman making a commitment to expand your knowledge. As such, the materials roll out in a way that is easy to follow, accessible, and in manageable pieces.

Frequently Asked Questions [Can I fit this courses into my busy life? Can I do this program as a full-time mom or while maintaining a job?] Going to medical school as a mom of four, I totally get how intense it can be to fit study into an already full life. Please know that this is a rigorous course intended to put real-life actionable skills in your hands and to help you approach peeling back the onion on even the most complex cases in your practice. It will take your time, attention, and commitment. However, skills will be presented gently, and will build incrementally and naturally over time, starting with foundations and working our way together through the language and options of integrative and functional medicine for women's health. I know, with careful planning and a commitment, it can be done. That said, you are also welcome to work at your own pace. You have lifelong access to all of the study materials and 6 months after the end of the program to complete the quizzes and final exam. The live Q&A sessions are recorded and the audio is also posted to the website. If you know in advance that you will be unable to attend a live call but still have a question, there will always be a way to submit your question in advance. Online learning is such an effective educational model that even major universities incorporate it into their programs. It's a particularly excellent option for busy women, allowing you to learn in the comfort of your home or favorite study space, at your own pace, with a cup of tea (or glass of wine!) in hand, in large time periods, or smaller chunks. Online learning models offer multimedia personal touches like video and audio that you can download whenever you have the chance and access permanently. It allows you to drop those old-school academic anxieties and finally learn what and how you want to - with no pressure! Sometimes life happens and it becomes difficult to keep up with something we enroll in. If you fall behind, don't worry - you have access to the program for 6 months beyond the end of our time together. While you may miss live Q&A and Case Review sessions, these will be recorded so you can listen to them at your convenience. The amount of food information out there is mind-boggling. On any given day you can get as many opinions on what's best to eat as there are experts. Even health professionals can find it overwhelming. But there are some very clear threads of truth that leading health scientists have been able to extract from all of the food noise out there. In this course, we will uncover those core truths, while also exploring the pros, cons, and actual science on the various therapeutic diets you might consider. Importantly, this program is based on the premises of replenishment and nourishment, time-tested information, and Dr. Romm's unique vantage point of having personal and collegial relationships with some of the leading voices in the food and health movement including Dr. David Katz, Dr. Boyd Eaton, Dr. Tieraona Low Dog, and many others. Gone are the days when any of us can do it all alone. We need teams and our patients and clients do, too. Most doctors, for example, don't have time to help patients make the critical behavioral changes needed for effectively implementing their programs - and patients often get stuck in old habits, patterns, and self-sabotage.Enter the nutritionists and health coaches. To be effective in this new model, we need to learn to speak a common language, understand the goals and protocols, and support each other in helping our patients and clients reach their health goals. A fully integrated professional team supporting women would ideally include a medical or licensed health practitioner, a nurse practitioner, a nutritionist, and a health coach, even if not all in the same office or practice. Therefore, my goal is to provide training that brings together these various members of the team in a collaborative learning space. This course can be used solely as a self-study program and at your own pace without fulfilling any specific requirements. However, to receive the Certificate of Completion as well as CMEs, and to be able to say you completed this program with Dr. Aviva Romm, you must successfully complete a short, automatically graded 10-question quiz at the end of each module, and successfully complete a final exam that is also submitted electronically. The final exam is a closed book, no-surprise, no-trick-question test based upon the quizzes. You have 6 months from the end of the program to complete all modules, quizzes, and the final exam. For now this is a women-only course. My experience with over 30 years of teaching is that this allows for a uniquely embracing and relaxed experience for students, a high level of openness in the course dialogue and forums, and eliminates politics that have been shown to negatively impact group and individual learning and sharing dynamics for women. Completing this course does not provide certification nor does it in any way substitute for clinical experience under the supervision and guidance of an experienced herbal practitioner. Completion of this program in no way confers the right or ability to practice any form of health care. Graduates will receive a Certificate of Completion and are welcome to advertise that they have completed this training program This program is designed for health professionals and presupposes basic science and health knowledge - the Case Review and Q&A sessions will reflect this. However, you do not need medical training or prior functional medicine training to be successful and make use of the program. Dr. Romm is well known for her accessible teaching style and ability to make complex concepts understandable and applicable. A list of adjunct textbooks and resources will be provided should you feel you need basic functional and integrative medicine references. You may withdraw your enrollment up until 21 days prior to the start date of the program. If you withdraw you will be given a refund of any amount you've paid minus your deposit of $2,000, which is non-refundable. After this time, no refunds will be issued. We understand that personal and family emergencies can occur during a student's time of enrollment that might prevent completion of the course within the allotted 16 months. Requests for deferment will be considered on an individual basis, by petition to the Course Director. Deferment is available only for the next two academic years of the program. The cost for deferment to the following class is $2,500; the cost for a deferment to a second year is $3,500. Any student granted a deferment must retake the entire program from the beginning. If you withdraw at any time during the program, full payment is still due, as once registration closes, we cannot give your spot to another student. Hopefully you will not have to withdraw from the program. That said, life happens, and if, for any reason you anticipate that you will not be able to complete the program during the allotted time, you can simply download all of the materials before the expiration of your access to the course website (16 months from the date of your first class). That way you will have everything you need to continue your studies when you are able. Please note that no refunds are available outside of the [refund policy](https://avivaromm.com/nmwi-policies-terms/) and, if you are on a payment plan, you are still expected to make all of your monthly tuition payments until you have met your full financial commitment. The concepts and model of functional and integrative medicine for women that I am teaching are relevant to practitioners globally, and in fact, are important as chronic disease is escalating around the world. I am accustomed to teaching students from all over the world\u2014my Herbal Medicine for Women program has students from over 20 countries\u2014and we welcome your participation and unique experiences based on your country's health care system. However, some of the specific tests and supplements I recommend may not be available in every country. In addition, in evaluating lab tests, I will be using US lab values and ranges.
