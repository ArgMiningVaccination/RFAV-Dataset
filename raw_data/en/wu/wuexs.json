You have towed that line at some point. Where everything in your life looks like it's going downhill, descending so fast it's beginning to conform to the laws of gravity; and the laws of Newton start to resonate in your mind - what goes up must eventually come down! Whether you are fighting the great recession, dealing with a break up, coping with retrenchment, or stress at work, these external factors can take a toll on your well being and mental frame of mind. When life throws you lemons, what do you do? You make lemonade out of it. Yes - Lemonade! And not just any kind of lemonade, but the sweet thirst quenching one that keeps people wondering what secret recipe you rustled together. Life is not determined by what happens to you but the attitude you bring into life. Here are 6 tips to help you keep mind, body and soul together and get you through life's tides and seasons. 1. Be selfish Sometimes it has to be all about you. Turn off your smartphone, let your partner worry about dinner for the kids or taking the dogs for a walk. Create that peaceful atmosphere without any distractions where you can mediate, pray and reflect. Take deep breaths, inhale and exhale. Breathing helps calm the mind and makes you feel at peace, providing a sense of calmness and serenity. This process clears your thoughts and prepares you for a good night's rest. 2. Cry me a river Cry if you must, wail if you have to but tears are a good form of therapy. It cleanses your mind and helps you move on from things weighing you down. According to [psychologist](https://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2011/05/29/7-good-reasons-to-cry-the-healing-property-of-tears/), tears are a natural expression of emotions, and crying is a good mood lifter that also helps to reduce stress. So grab a tissue, watch a soppy movie, listen to your favourite \"sad\" song and let it all out. 3. Live in the moment You need to take each day one step at a time. Enjoy the joy, laughter and happiness around you and stay in the company of those who bring a smile to your face. Channel your energies into what you love doing by picking up a new hobby or learning a new craft. Remember you cannot change the past but you can shape the present. Stay grounded in the present and shift your focus to things that are within your control. 4. Eat Healthy Now is not the time to binge eat and take out all your emotions on food. If you must do so, ensure you binge healthy. Take some greens, remember your 5-a-day, not forgetting the good carbs and proteins too. The whole idea is to keep it balanced, ensuring your body receives all the nutrients it needs. Dont forget to stay hydrated; drink a glass of warm water with half of a [lemon](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/health-benefits-lemon-water) in the morning, and have your [ 8 glasses of water](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256) throughout the rest of the day. 5. Get your groove back Start to appreciate you and your environment. Give yourself a makeover; sport a new look- from blonde to brunette or get a new hair cut. Indulge in some retail therapy, but don't over do it. Book a spa treatment and get pampered. The whole idea is to do what makes you feel special and remind yourself of how awesome and wonderful you are. You can also make changes to your physical space, change the layout of your living room or get new bright curtains that lift up your mood when the sun rays hit your window. 6. Take a trip Give yourself that well deserved get away. It doesn't have to be a holiday at the Cayman's or the Caribbean's. A trip to your favourite aunt who lives in the country side where the air is clean and fresh, with the sight of green fields, and the smell of baked [apple crumble](http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/applecrumble_2971) and [Yorkshire pudding](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/9020/best-yorkshire-puddings) can equally do the magic. Enjoy the sights and sounds of nature, soak into the serene environment, forget about your city life and all your worries. A change in physical environment helps rejuvenate the mind and uplifts your spirits. "}
