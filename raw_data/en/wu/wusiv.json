PY - 2022/3 Y1 - 2022/3 N2 - Controlling the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), will rely on vaccination at increasing rates and in an equitable manner.

While vaccine hesitancy is complicated and requires long-term solutions, access can be enhanced through evidence-based delivery strategies that augment conventional approaches.

Hospital-based programs that have been successful in implementing influenza and other routine vaccinations can leverage existing infrastructure, such as electronic health record-related tools. With the possibility of COVID-19 becoming endemic, much like seasonal influenza, these programs will require flexibility as well as planning for long-term sustainability.
