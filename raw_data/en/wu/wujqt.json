It's never fun to get a stomach ache, but unfortunately, it happens all the time. Whether you [chowed down on something that's gone bad](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a26078857/what-happens-if-you-eat-mold/), have a food intolerance, [ate a little too fast or too much](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19964592/stomach-hurts-after-eating/) at lunch, the pain and associated discomfort (cue the [bloating](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/g23692194/how-to-reduce-bloating/), [diarrhea](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/g19996282/diarrhea-remedies/), and [nausea](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a41925892/feeling-nauseous/)) can make it really hard for you to focus on anything other than looking up ways on how to get rid of a stomach ache. Basically, stomach aches can occur whenever there is irritation of the stomach lining, says [Henry Herrera](https://dhrhealth.com/physicians/henry-herrera-md), MD, a gastroenterologist at DHR Health Gastroenterology in Texas. Thankfully, stomach aches don't usually last that long, maybe one to two hours tops. And they typically go away on their own. That said, the duration doesn't really tell you whether you're dealing with something benign (like having a natural reaction to too much spicy food) or [an underlying medical issue](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a33535554/why-does-my-stomach-hurt/), says [Leila Kia](https://www.nm.org/doctors/1609009406/leila-kia-md), MD, a gastroenterologist at Northwestern Medicine. \"Other factors must be considered, such as the character of the pain, intensity, and location along with associated symptoms,\" she adds. If you're dealing with run-of-the-mill stomach pain (meaning you know what exactly brought it on, like after consuming foods that have always been problematic for you or overindulging at a dinner out with friends), you can soothe your tummy troubles with home remedies. You should know, though, some of your old standbys may not help and can even make you feel worse. For example, the bubbles and sugar in ginger ale can feed the bad bacteria making you sick. You may have heard that [lemon water](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a19895199/lemon-water-weight-loss/) is good for digestion, but \"keep in mind that acidic foods also tend to be associated with increases in reflux symptoms,\" says Dr. Herrera. Meet the experts: [Henry Herrera](https://dhrhealth.com/physicians/henry-herrera-md), MD, is a gastroenterologist at DHR Health Gastroenterology in Texas. [Leila Kia](https://www.nm.org/doctors/1609009406/leila-kia-md), MD, is a gastroenterologist at Northwestern Medicine. [Amit Bhan](https://www.henryford.com/physician-directory/b/bhan-amit), MD, is a gastroenterologist at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. So, when should you worry? If the pain does not subside with OTC meds, is keeping or waking you up at night, or is accompanied by [weight loss](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a37888127/why-am-i-losing-weight/), blood in your stool, vomiting, or [a fever](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a32236807/how-to-check-fever-without-thermometer/), you should make an appointment to see a doc ASAP. Feeling a rumble down below and aren't sure how to properly get rid of your stomach ache? Try one of these 22 easy fixes recommended by gastroenterologists at home. Give it time Mild stomach aches can go away on their own if you wait a little. This also applies when you're dealing with diarrhea, which could be a symptom of mild food poisoning. While this can totally happen at your neighborhood sushi joint, it's also super common when you travel overseas. That's because your body has to adjust to the new bacteria in the food and water you're consuming away from home. Being patient is the best thing you can do in these scenarios. \"You need to let your body flush itself,\" says [Amit Bhan](https://www.henryford.com/physician-directory/b/bhan-amit), MD, a gastroenterologist at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. Try over-the-counter medicine ICYMI, [gas](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a19997333/foods-to-help-de-bloat/) is caused by two things: eating gas-forming foods such as green vegetables, fruits with peels on them, carbonated beverages, cabbage, and beans; or by swallowing air, explains [Michael Wolfe](https://physiology.case.edu/events/seminar/sem_60/), MD, the chair of the Case Western Reserve University department of medicine at MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio. \"People [take in extra air] when they drink with straws, talk with their mouths full, eat too fast, or when they're nervous,\" he says. If you have a gas problem that you think is causing your stomach pain, take an OTC drug like Mylanta Gas. Beano, Dr. Wolfe says, is another good option, especially if veggies aren't friendly to your system\u2014it breaks down raffinose, a sugar byproduct in plants that can be tough to digest. Dr. Bhan recommends knocking back some Pepto-Bismol if diarrhea strikes at a bad time or if it's so frequent that it keeps you up at night. The pink liquid will attack the diarrhea-causing bacteria in your system, so you can rest and function during the day. You can also take Imodium, which works by slowing down the speed at which fluids flow through your intestines. Take ibuprofen if you have cramps Sure, you expect [cramps](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19993421/period-symptoms-but-no-period/) around the time of your period, but nausea, upset stomach, and diarrhea? It's actually pretty normal for your whole abdominal region to go haywire when you're menstruating, per [Nancy Cossler](https://www.uhhospitals.org/doctors/Cossler-Nancy-1548285836), MD, an ob-gyn and the chief of system quality for obstetrics at University Hospital in Ohio. \"Hormones cause contractions of the uterine muscle, which causes cramping,\" she says. To ease cramps, take an ibuprofen 12 to 24 hours before you're expecting your period, Dr. Cossler says. Then take the prescribed amount every three to six hours for three days. Eat yogurt If you deal with constant stomach issues like bloating, [yogurt](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a31245749/kefir-vs-yogurt/) can help keep your digestive system in tip-top shape. Though annoying, bloating is generally not a huge cause for concern. \"Don't be too worried,\" says [David C. Metz](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p4464), MD, a professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. \"Anything from menstruation to [constipation](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19984082/how-to-make-yourself-poop/) can cause it.\" As long as you've ruled out lactose intolerance, try eating yogurt with \"live and active cultures\" (look for this phrase on the label!), which can help regulate your digestive system. Drink milk Sometimes stomach aches can lead to other pains, like [heartburn](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/g29344302/acid-reflux-pillow/), an irritation of the esophagus that feels like burning or tightness from stomach contents that are forced back up into the esophagus. Here, an at-home remedy you already have can help: milk. \"When I have heartburn, I drink a glass of milk,\" says [Jeffry A. Katz](https://www.uhhospitals.org/doctors/Katz-Jeffry-1730109497), MD, a gastroenterologist at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. \"Milk neutralizes the acid produced by the stomach.\" Avoid spicy foods Eating spicy foods before bed is a common culprit of acid reflux, as is eating too much or too fast, smoking, and imbibing heavily. But nearly anything can make you feel the burn and result in a stomach ache. \"This condition often hits at night, when you're in the lying-down position,\" says [Minh Nguyen](https://www.foxchase.org/minhhuyen-nguyen), MD, a gastroenterologist at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. She recommends a prescription medicine or an over-the-counter antacid like Prilosec. But if you don't want to rely on drugs, cut back on the known triggers can prevent this from happening in the long run. Sip ginger tea Another simple cure may be waiting for you in your kitchen: Ginger root has a long history of being used as a cure for an upset stomach. The reason ginger works so well for digestion has never been precisely identified, but some say it speeds up the pace at which food moves into the small intestine from the stomach. \"[When] I've eaten too much and feel nauseated, I'll have ginger tea to soothe my stomach,\" says [Charlene Prather](https://gastro.wustl.edu/people/charlene-m-prather-m-d-m-p-h/), MD, an associate professor of gastroenterology at Saint Louis University School of Medicine. \"It's really easy to make\u2014I just grate fresh ginger in water and add a little honey and it takes care of it.\" Cut out fast food and eat more slowly There's no sugar-coating this one: If you feel pain after a meal, you likely ate too fast, too much, or the wrong thing. The quick fix: Eliminate fast food, and slow down at the table. If you're not a junk-food junkie and are still feeling ill afterwards, it's unlikely, but you could have gallbladder disease. \"Women more often than men get it, and some get gallstones for no reason,\" says [Frank Marrero](https://physicians.lcmh.com/gastroenterology/frank-marrero-md), MD, a gastroenterologist at Lake Charles Memorial Health System in Louisiana. If tweaking your eating habits doesn't help, see your doc to rule this one out. Increase your fiber intake Rumor has it that you have to go [number two](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19924194/am-i-pooping-too-much/) three times a day to have healthy bowels. The truth? Everybody poops, but not with the same frequency. Still, constipation is very common in women, says [Irwin Grosman](https://doctors.nyp.org/irwin-m-grosman-md/newyork-presbyterian-medical-group-brooklyn-multi-specialty), MD, the associate chief of gastroenterology at NYP Brooklyn Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn. \"There's a theory that there's a hormonal difference between men and women, and [that] women take longer to digest and eliminate food,\" he adds. The bottom line: If you don't go every day, don't sweat it. But if you're experiencing other symptoms of constipation, such as bloating or gas, [add more fiber](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a19967218/foods-high-in-fiber/) to your diet. Fill your plate with more fruits and vegetables, whole grains and beans, and kick-start your day with a high-fiber cereal. Get more exercise Inactivity can sometimes cause constipation too. Aim for 30 minutes of exercise per day and keep yourself hydrated. If all that doesn't keep things moving, try a gentle over-the-counter [fiber supplement](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/g40039061/fiber-supplement/) like Metamucil. Avoid gas-producing veggies If you're dealing with green poop and an upset stomach, veggies could be to blame. \"Our dietary vegetable intake is usually the cause of green stool. Stomach aches in this setting can usually be remedied by avoiding major gas-producing vegetables such as asparagus, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts,\" says Dr. Herrera. Minimize the amount you eat until you feel better. Get your regular meals in The digestive system's natural contractions are felt more severely on an empty stomach. Without food, the stomach becomes a gastric echo chamber. Hunger pangs serve a handy purpose: They're like a text message from the stomach to the brain telling it that it's time to pursue nourishment. So, make sure you eat. But beware, because in rare cases, an achy stomach could indicate more than hunger. \"Sometimes people sense a burning pain that gets better when you eat,\" says Mark Babyatsky, MD, who was a gastroenterologist and assistant professor of medicine at the Mount Sinai Icahn School of Medicine in New York. \"That could be an ulcer. If it persists, see a physician. If you've always had it, it could be just your appetite.\" Stay full by eating small meals throughout the day. Try acupuncture or cognitive behavioral therapy Sometimes a digestive disease, like gastritis or a peptic ulcer, may be responsible for indigestion. But more commonly, chronic indigestion is known as functional dyspepsia\u2014or indigestion without a known health problem behind it, per the [National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/indigestion-dyspepsia/definition-facts). After ruling out underlying conditions with your doctor, an OTC antacid should help soothe your tummy, says [Rita Knotts](https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1083971782/rita-m-knotts), MD, a gastroenterologist and assistant professor of medicine at NYU Langone Health. If you're looking for a long-term solution, Dr. Knotts recommends trying cognitive behavioral therapy or acupuncture, since the indigestion could be caused by stress. Avoid bubbly drinks [Burping](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19924614/excessive-burping-symptoms/) is actually a natural reflex response to increased gas in your system, Dr. Knotts says. Foods or beverages that promote gas (think: carbonated beverages) may be to blame. Dr. Knotts suggests avoiding bubbles, so swap soda or beer for water or wine. Drink water When you go for a run (or really, do any type of workout), you might feel that little pinch of pain in your side. That's typically musculoskeletal pain caused by [dehydration](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a26255080/how-much-water-should-i-drink-per-day/) or eating too much before you started your sweat session, says Dr. Knotts. So drink up. And next time, before you begin exercising, Dr. Knotts suggests making sure you had some time to digest. Give yourself at least an hour (better yet, a couple) after a meal. Try chamomile tea Chamomile can relieve symptoms of an upset stomach, including nausea and vomiting. It contains bisabolol, which has anti-inflammatory properties and relaxes the smooth muscle lining of the digestive tract, according to Dr. Herrera. Have some spearmint or peppermint Thanks to their menthol content, both spearmint and peppermint can soothe the pain of a stomach ache. Menthol has been shown to relax the muscles in the GI tract, says Dr. Herrera. But if you're experiencing acid reflux, it's best to avoid these. \"It can worsen reflux by relaxing the sphincter, which keeps stomach contents out of the esophagus,\" he explains. Drink aloe vera juice Just can't seem to go? Aloe can serve as a laxative, which is helpful for people who have stomach pain due to constipation, says Dr. Herrera. Aloe juice may provide relief to those dealing with acid reflux by reducing the frequency of symptoms associated with the condition, found a 2015 study published in the [Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26742306/). Try a low-FODMAP diet \"This diet has been shown to be effective in managing stomach pain and bloating in patients with irritable bowel syndrome because it eliminates many gas-producing foods,\" Dr. Herrera says. [A low-FODMAP diet](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a38582932/low-fodmap-diet/) can potentially alleviate the symptoms of stomach aches, bloating, and other GI problems by limiting your intake of fermentable carbs. (This is an [elimination diet](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19977355/elimination-diet-0/), so you'll want to do this under the supervision of a healthcare provider.) Avoid lying down too quickly after a meal This is especially important for people who are prone to acid reflux. \"Lying down too quickly will result in stomach contents moving into the esophagus, which results in an unpleasant feeling of pressure or pain, along with a bitter taste,\" says Dr. Herrera. Schedule your last meal of the day to be at least three hours before lying down or going to bed, per Dr. Kia. I Ate Raw Chicken. Now What?
