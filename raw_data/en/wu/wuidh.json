Introduction The Department of Health (DoH) circular HSS(MD)82/2020 'Deployment of the COVID-19 Vaccine in Northern Ireland' (7 December 2020) sets out the public health measures to be put in place to help contain and reduce the spread of COVID-19 by the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations to the Northern Ireland population. The Public Health Agency (PHA), along with support from HSC Trusts, General Medical Services including Community Pharmacies are responsible for the implementation of the NI COVID-19 Vaccination and Seasonal Flu Programmes. The PHA is the data controller for the Vaccination Management System (VMS), under the Data Protection Legislation, which includes UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK Data Protection Act 2018. The PHA is operationally responsible for the Vaccine Management System (VMS) and decides the means and purposes of processing it's data, including who has access to it. Personal records are stored and processed for the following products: - COVID-19 vaccine (including booster doses), - Flu vaccine records from 2021 - Shingles vaccine records from April 2023 PHA manages the system and the data processing independently on a day to day basis and is the contact point for any individual who wishes to access their data, or exercise any of their data subject rights. This privacy notice describes the type of personal data collected and held for these named vaccine products on the Vaccine Management System (VMS) for Northern Ireland, the way that your data is used and your rights in respect of this. 2. COVID-19 Vaccination Programme The COVID-19 Vaccination Programme is designed to enable the population of Northern Ireland to access COVID-19 vaccinations to develop immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has set out a prioritisation for persons at risk. JCVI ranked the eligible groups according to risk, largely based on prevention of COVID-19-specific mortality. Further information on the phasing of vaccinations for particular groups of the population will be advised by JCVI and DoH and will be published by the PHA [here](https://www.publichealth.hscni.net/covid-19-coronavirus). The COVID 19 vaccine will be administered by registered clinical staff trained in vaccination procedures. All SMS and email appointment confirmation and reminder messages come from HSC vaccine to the mobile or email address supplied at booking. If you use the online system you will receive confirmation of your appointment bookings and reminders of your appointments either by email or text SMS. The messaging mechanism may also be used for the purposes of Vaccine 'Recall', which involves sending reminders, via text SMS or email, to citizens who had previously had a vaccine to advise that they may be eligible for another vaccine. For those residents in nursing and residential care no booking will be required as mobile teams of vaccination staff will visit individuals at home on a set day. Further information on the NI COVID-19 Vaccination Programme can be found at: [Get a COVID-19 vaccination in Northern Ireland | nidirect](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/get-covid-19-vaccination-northern-ireland) 3. The Flu Vaccination Programme Seasonal changes in the influenza (flu) virus occur and it is for this reason that annual vaccination against flu is recommended in certain groups who are either at risk of the complications of flu, or at risk of passing flu on to people at risk of developing complications. Every year the Chief Medical Officer in Northern Ireland issues a letter outlining who is eligible to receive the flu vaccine under the seasonal influenza programme. Flu immunisation is one of the most effective interventions healthcare can provide to reduce harm from flu and pressures on health and social care services during the winter. It is important to increase flu vaccine uptake in clinical risk groups because of increased risk of death and serious illness if people in these groups catch flu. In previous years only around half of patients under 65 years in clinical risk groups have been vaccinated. Influenza during pregnancy may be associated with increased risk of infant death before or after birth prematurity, smaller neonatal size, lower birth weight and increased risk of complications for mothers. Vaccination of health and social care workers protects them and reduces the risk of spreading flu to their patients, service users, colleagues, and family members. In addition, by preventing flu infection through vaccination, secondary bacterial infections such as pneumonia are prevented. This year high uptake of flu vaccine is even more crucial than ever. Those most at risk from flu are also the most vulnerable to COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality. There is evidence that co-infection of COVID-19 and flu can increase mortality. From 2021 the PHA will use the VMS to record flu vaccinations. Capturing flu vaccination data on the VMS simplifies the effort required by GPs to capture the information, thus saving them time, and allowing them to treat more patients. Further information on the NI Flu Programme can be found at: NI Direct [here.](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/flu-vaccine) 4. The Shingles Vaccination Programme Shingles is caused by a virus called varicella zoster, the same virus that causes chickenpox. When you recover from chickenpox most of this virus is destroyed, but some survives and lies inactive in your body's nervous system. This virus may become active again later in life, when your immune system has been weakened due to a variety of factors such as age, stress, illness or certain medicines/treatments that can impact your immunity. Shingles can be very painful and uncomfortable. Some people are left with pain lasting for years after the initial rash has healed. Shingles can also be fatal in some rare cases (1 in 1000 for those over the age of 70). The shingles vaccine reduces your risk of getting shingles. If you do go on to have the disease, your symptoms may be milder and the illness shorter. Routine vaccination for shingles is available for those aged 70 to 79. Previously, people with a weakened immune system couldn't have a shingles vaccine (Zostavax\u00ae). However, an alternative vaccine (Shingrix\u00ae) is now available for these individuals. A programme of catch up is under way for those in this group who did not have the opportunity to receive a shingles vaccine and from September 2023, all individuals eligible for the shingles vaccine will be offered Shingrix. From April 2023 the PHA will use the VMS to record all shingles vaccinations. Capturing shingles vaccination data on the VMS standardises the way GPs capture the information for both vaccines currently in use in the NI programme. Further information on the NI Shingles Vaccination Programme can be found at: NI Direct [here.](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/shingles-vaccine) 5. Why are you processing my personal information? Your personal information is used for the following purposes: - confirming the appointment at your GP, Community Pharmacist, or regional vaccination centre (if that is where you are having your vaccination) - performing a security and ID verification at the vaccination centre for COVID-19 vaccinations - processing your vaccination - sharing the details of your vaccination with your GP - sharing the details of your vaccination if you request a COVID-19 certificate (see separate Privacy Notice for Covid Certification Service (CCS)). - undertaking quality assurance of the vaccination process including clinical procedure and patient data entry in VMS - analysis to support operational decisions to improve the vaccination process, such as: - day-to-day use, for example whether someone attended their appointment; - to inform regional vaccination centres of improvements to the vaccination process, for example to manage capacity or follow up on serious adverse effects; - support logistics planning; - observation to identify trends in the uptake, efficacy, and effectiveness of both the flu and COVID-19 vaccines. Identifiable data will be used by the PHA from the VMS for health protection purposes. Anonymised information gathered will be used for reports and the production of official statistics and helps to inform DoH policy. Flu and shingles vaccination data will be used by the PHA for the purposes of managing vaccine efficacy, effectiveness and for population health management. Disease observation and monitoring is a core public health function of the PHA. Health bodies need to make sure they have the right information available to them at the right time to inform decisions and actions across the public health system. This helps the PHA to control the spread of COVID, reduce the impacts of flu and reduce the burden of shingles in the population Observation involves gathering a wide variety of anonymised data about a disease from a range of sources, to provide us with situational awareness. This also applies to the uptake of vaccinations. This is then used to inform public health action to help prevent and control both diseases. This will also allow data linkage with other datasets to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on health services e.g. in-patient admissions, intensive care admissions, long COVID. 6. What information is collected? Data to be collected When you book your vaccine appointment you will be asked to provide the following information: - First name - Family name (last name) - Date of birth - Sex - Health and Care Number (this can be found on any letter from HSC, any prescription or medical care record) - Ethnicity - Address - Postcode - Contact telephone number - Email address - GP name and practice At the vaccination appointment the following information will be collected and added to the vaccine management system - Date of vaccination - Dose number - Batch numbers for each vaccine - Manufacturer - Any conditions you may have that are considered high risk - Your pregnancy status For people employed in health and social care additional information will be collected for those being administered a COVID/flu vaccine: - Place of work - Job role - Staff Number - RQIA home code For vaccinations administered in nursing homes where the online booking has not been required the demographic details will be collected at the time of vaccination. For COVID-19 vaccines you may also be asked to provide some additional information about yourself when you attend for vaccinations by the person vaccinating you, for example confirmation you have no symptoms or other reasons why you may have to defer your vaccination. Please note that the PHA Vaccination Programmes will never: - Disclose any personal or health/medical information provided by you to anyone other than the PHA, your GP practice patient record system or the processors listed in Annex A. Additionally, for Health and Social Care (HSC) staff, Occupational Health will hold a record of your vaccination; anonymised data will be shared with HSC employers as management reports on vaccine uptake. - Ask you to dial a premium rate number (for example, those starting 09 or 087) to speak to us; - Ask you to make any form of payment or purchase a product of any kind; - Ask for any details about your bank account; - Ask for your social media identities or login details, or those of your contacts; - Ask for any passwords or PINs, or ask you to set up any passwords or PINs over the phone; - Ask you to download any software to your PC or ask you to hand over control of your PC, smartphone or tablet to anyone else; - Ask you to access any website or smartphone application that does not belong to the Government, or HSC. 7. The lawful basis for processing your personal information The lawful basis for processing your personal information under the UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018 is: - UK GDPR Article 6(1)(e) [[1]](https://covid-19.hscni.net/vaccine-service-privacy-notice/#_ftn1)- the processing is necessary for the performance of official tasks carried out in the public interest. The DoH - SPPG plans and oversees the delivery of health and social care services for the population of Northern Ireland. The Group is part of the Department of Health and is accountable to the Minister for Health. It is responsible for planning, improving and overseeing the delivery of effective, high quality, safe health and social care services within available resources. The PHA - provides strategic oversight and coordination of the implementation and ongoing delivery of regional vaccination programmes; provision of resources for health professionals and the public; interventions to improve uptake; disease and vaccine coverage surveillance; investigation, and management of cases, outbreaks and other immunisation incidents; and provision of expert advice to policy makers, commissioners, providers and the public. In this instance the public task relates to the functions of the Public Health Agency which the Agency exercises on behalf of the Department of Health as outlined in the Health and Social Care (Reform) Act (Northern Ireland), 2009, section 13: (a) the health improvement functions mentioned in subsection (2); (b) the health protection functions mentioned in subsection (3); and (c) obtaining and analysis of data and other information in subsection (4).
