Although the stages of Reiki training may vary depending on your school or instructor, it is typically taught in 3 stages or \"degrees.\" The first degree focuses on teaching students simple techniques that they can use on themselves and friends or family. You will learn about the history and precepts of Reiki, as well as basic healing techniques. [[8]](#_note-8)X Research source - First-degree training typically takes only 8-12 hours to complete, although some beginning courses may take longer (e.g., 1-2 days). - The cost of first-degree or beginning Reiki training may vary depending on your teacher or school, but introductory classes often cost around $200 USD. [[9]](#_note-9)X Research source - Training may include the basics of hand placement, meditation techniques, and hands-on practice. - Find a teacher that connects with you and that makes you feel strongly about their skill in the Reiki practice (that certainty can only come from experiencing a session firsthand).

Spiritual Advisor & Founder of Rainbow Raaja - 4Complete a second-degree course to learn more advanced techniques. In many Reiki training programs, the second stage of learning involves the use of distance healing. These techniques emphasize using mental focus for indirect manipulation of energies, rather than directly laying hands on the body. These techniques may be useful in situations where direct touch is inappropriate or impossible (e.g., for relieving pain from open wounds). - Different instructors or schools may have different prerequisites for second-degree training. For example, you may be required to have practiced first-degree Reiki self-care for at least 6 months or to have completed a certain number of supervised clinical practice sessions. [[11]](#_note-11)X Research source - Check with your teacher or school to find out how long the training lasts and how much it will cost.

Research has shown that therapeutic touch may be helpful for: - Reducing pain - Alleviating stress and anxiety - Promoting wound healing - Improving breathing and relaxation - Lowering blood pressure - When used in combination with medical treatments, it may also help relieve some symptoms associated with conditions such as fibromyalgia, sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, allergies, bronchitis, addictions, lupus, Alzheimer's disease, and chronic pain. - 2Look for a qualified therapeutic touch instructor in your area. In order to become a qualified practitioner of therapeutic touch, you will need appropriate training.

Expert Q&A [Add New Question] become a Reiki Therapist? [Emily Christensen](/Author/Emily-Christensen) Spiritual Advisor & Founder of Rainbow RaajaSpiritual Advisor & Founder of Rainbow RaajaExpert AnswerFirst, identify what your intention is for the practice so you can find a teacher who can guide you to pursuing and achieving those goals. Then, search for a teacher who specializes in the field you are interested in. The last step is to pursue the legal requirements for practicing Reiki. Keep in mind that not all Reiki sessions and teachers feel the same! [Submit] Warnings - Energy healing is most helpful as a supplement to standard forms of medical treatment and therapy. While it may offer relief from certain symptoms, there is no evidence that it can cure diseases or heal physical ailments. Practice energy healing responsibly, and encourage your patients and clients to seek medical attention from a doctor or other qualified healthcare professional to treat any medical conditions.Thanks References - [](#_ref-1) Spiritual Advisor & Founder of Rainbow Raaja.
