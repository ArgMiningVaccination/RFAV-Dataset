My mum came over to look after the kids and told me to spray this stuff into my mouth twice. I had no idea what it was, but we all trust our mum's right. Low and behold I didn't cough for hours. I looked into the ingredients and found out they were homeopathic. I used to think this stuff was a joke, but it really worked for me. Mum wouldn't give me hers though, she made me buy my own :) Best thing for kids in daycare Let's face it, daycare is a sess-pool of infection. Kids are forever sharing their germs with each other and ending up with green snot on a regular basis. My kids get given two sprays of this before daycare and when they get home and it has completely broken this cycle. What I love about this is the fact that they then sleep better. Stuffy noses and congestion equals poor sleep, which I think will lead to stunted growth. I love that such a simple product can help stimulate my kids own bodies immune system to kick these bugs without getting symptoms and I can rest assured that they are getting the sleep they need to develop into the best little human beings possible. Keeping myself healthy for the elderly patients I care for I work in aged care and with everything that's happening atm I can't take any risks. I am using this spray regularly to keep my immune system fighting at 100% Hardly ever get sick now I'm a health worker and can't afford to get sick. I have found that this spray has drastically reduced the number of times per year that I get sick and if I do end up getting a cold, it's gone within a day or so. I used to get sick all the time, 2 years ago I had 17 sick days, this year is halfway over and I haven't had any! Great stuff! Got rid of my husbands unrelenting cough My husband got really sick 4 years ago and has ended up with this cough that rears its **** head for about 6 months of the year. To the extent that we sleep in separate rooms. We started him using the immune relief spray during a bad bout of coughing on Dr Kez's recommendation and it has completely ceased the coughing. It has been over 5 months now, including a winter season and still no cough. Thank goodness. "}
