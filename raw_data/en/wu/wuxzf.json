We literally live in an ocean of bacteria and viruses. But this particular virus is new to our system, so our bodies are struggling with it. To see that we can produce the necessary antibodies and become capable of handling it - as we have become capable of handling everything else - there are a few things we can do. It is not that this is a cure for coronavirus, but if these simple things can be practiced, in six to eight weeks' time, one can see a significant betterment of one's immune system. - Neem and turmeric: Neem leaf is available all across India, except in the mountainous areas, and turmeric is anyway available. Now they are making what is called as nano-turmeric, where the absorption rate is way higher than the normal turmeric. You can consume eight to ten leaves of neem and a little bit of turmeric in warm water on an empty stomach. Your ability to fight external organisms is greatly enhanced. - Chyawanprash and raw mango: There are traditional offerings like chyawanprash that also build the immune system. If you have old people at home, beyond sixty years of age, it is good to start them on chyawanprash. Another thing is raw mango - it can boost the immune system a bit. - Amla with honey and peppercorns: Soak amla (gooseberry, or nellikai) in honey overnight, along with some broken black or green peppercorns. Have about three spoons three times a day. It works best if that is the first thing that you take, when you are on an empty stomach. - Mahavilva leaves: Mahavilva leaves are available in the Western Ghats region. You can eat about three to five leaves a day in the morning. - Get enough physical activity: Now people are at home. If they just sit around, and through the day if they are eating something or drinking alcohol, they will make themselves much more susceptible. One simple thing is to stay physically active. If you do not know anything else, at least simply jog on the spot every day at different times - maybe fifteen minutes at a time, five to six times a day. The body will try to handle things better. - Keep yourself joyful: Mental distress is definitely one way of putting down the immune system. To stay fully spirited, joyful, and exuberant is also a simple way of making your immune system and the body function much better. A joyful, sensible, and responsible human being can deal with situations much better than those who are dead serious about everything. Especially if you are in panic, you are paralysed. It is very important that all your faculties are in place, that your body and your brain function and respond the way they need to. - Use sound to create a burst of energy: We are in a situation where we do not have the whole picture about the virus. When the necessary information is not available, one's intellect feels helpless and will trigger emotions of depression, helplessness, and frantic reactions. This is a time when it is most important that you keep your energies effervescent. If you are bursting with energy within you, then even if you have no intellectual understanding, you will see you will do the right things with your system - it will function in a certain way. One thing you can do is use a powerful sound together with a certain intellectual, emotional or physical process. For instance, when you sit down or stand up, there is a whole change in how the system functions - not just physiologically but on the level of chemistry and energy. This is why in this culture we developed a process that if you sit down or stand up you say, 'Shiva', if you see something good or something bad, you say, 'Shiva'. When such a shift is happening, if you say a consecrated powerful word within yourself, there will be a burst of energy. Sadhguru is a guest contributor. Views expressed are personal.
