In older adults, however vaccines are generally less efficacious and the molecular mechanisms that underpin this remain largely unknown. Autophagy, a process known to prevent aging, is critical for the maintenance of immune memory in mice. Here, we show that autophagy is specifically induced in vaccine-induced antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in healthy human volunteers. In addition, reduced IFN secretion by RSV-induced T cells in older vaccinees correlates with low autophagy levels. We demonstrate that levels of the endogenous autophagy-inducing metabolite spermidine fall in human T cells with age. Spermidine supplementation in T cells from old donors recovers their autophagy level and function, similar to young donors' cells, in which spermidine biosynthesis has been inhibited. Finally, our data show that endogenous spermidine maintains autophagy via the translation factor eIF5A and transcription factor TFEB. In summary, we have provided evidence for the importance of autophagy in vaccine immunogenicity in older humans and uncovered two novel drug targets that may increase vaccination efficiency in the aging context. Introduction The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused a great threat to global public health in 2020 with the majority of deaths occurring in older adults. The development of effective treatments and vaccines against [COVID-19](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/overview/public-health-threats/coronavirus-disease-covid-19) is now more than ever becoming a pressing and urgent challenge to overcome ( [Zhang et al., 2020](#bib59); [Lurie et al., 2020](#bib21)). However, the successful vaccination of the elderly against pathogens is considered one of the big challenges in our society ( [Weinberger, 2018](#bib53); [Chen et al., 2009](#bib5)). Immunosenescence, which is characterized by poor induction and recall of B and T memory responses upon exposure to new antigens, can lead to reduced immune responses following immunization of older adults. While most vaccines are less immunogenic and effective in the older population ( [Weinberger, 2018](#bib53)), little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underpin immune senescence. Autophagy is thought to be one of the few cellular processes that underlie many facets of cellular aging including immune senescence ( [Zhang et al., 2016](#bib57)). By delivering unwanted cytoplasmic material to the lysosomes for degradation, autophagy limits mitochondrial dysfunction and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) ( [Rubinsztein et al., 2011](#bib39)). Autophagy degrades protein aggregates that accumulate with age and its age-related decline could contribute to 'inflamm-aging' ( [Salminen et al., 2012](#bib41)), the age-related increase in inflammatory cytokines in the blood and tissue. Loss of autophagy strongly promotes production of the inflammatory cytokines al., 2015](#bib47)). We previously found autophagy levels decline with age in human peripheral CD8+ T cells ( [Phadwal et al., 2012](#bib32)). Deletion of key autophagy genes leads to a prematurely aged immune phenotype, with loss of function in mouse memory CD8+ T cells ( [Xu et al., bias ( [Mortensen et al., 2011](#bib28)). In addition, we find in autophagy-deficient immune cells the same cellular phenotype that cells display in older organisms; they accumulate ROS and damaged mitochondria ( [Stranks et al., 2015](#bib47); [Puleston et al., 2014](#bib34)). Importantly, we can improve CD8+ T memory responses from aged mice with spermidine ( [Puleston et al., 2014](#bib34)), an endogenous metabolite synthesized from arginine. It was shown in yeast and other model organisms that spermidine extends life-span via increased autophagy ( [Madeo et al., 2018](#bib23)). Several downstream mechanisms of spermidine-induced autophagy have been described in mice, including the inhibition of histone de-acetylases ( [Madeo et al., 2018](#bib23)). Recently, we uncovered a novel pathway in which spermidine donates a residue for the hypusination of the translation factor eIF5a, which is necessary for the translation of a three proline motif present in the master transcription factor of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis, called TFEB ( [Zhang et al., 2019](#bib58)). We demonstrated that this pathway operates in activated B cells, which upon activation have an unusually high-protein synthesis rate, owing to the high production of immunoglobulins. It is likely that B cells may be particularly reliant on the unfolded protein response, the proteasome, and autophagy, to cope with this high rate of protein synthesis. B cells may have evolved special coping strategies including the translational signaling for autophagy via eIF5A and TFEB. We therefore sought to extend our findings to another immune cell type, CD8+ T cells, to investigate whether this pathway may be conserved in a related adaptive immune subset and possibly broadly applicable. Here, we show for the first time that autophagy is indeed highly active in human CD8+ T cells after the in vivo encounter of antigens in donors from two different experimental vaccination trials. Our data show that polyamine levels fall with age in peripheral mononuclear cells. When supplemented with spermidine, the dysfunctional autophagic flux can be rejuvenated in CD8+ T cells from old donors, and levels of the important effector molecules IFN and perforin are enhanced as a consequence. Moreover, autophagy and effector function are maintained by spermidine in T cells from young donors. Lastly, in human CD8+ T cells we show that spermidine signals via eIF5A and TFEB to maintain autophagy levels. This study demonstrates that the function of human CD8+ T cells can be improved with spermidine. Taken together with our previous work on B cells, this leads us to the hypothesis that both T and B cell responses to infections and vaccinations are exquisitely reliant on sufficient autophagy levels, which are maintained by intracellular spermidine. This work highlights the potential of spermidine as a vaccine adjuvant in the older adults. Results First, we optimized a flow cytometry-based assay to reliably and reproducibly measure autophagy, before applying it to measure autophagy after in vivo antigen-stimulated T cells post-vaccination. To inhibit the autophagic flux and thereby degradation of LC3-II, the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A was added to the culture for 2 hr before washing out non-membrane-bound LC3-I and staining. In Jurkat cells, a human lymphocyte line, we confirmed that treatment with bafilomycin A1 increases LC3-II by both flow cytometry and western blot ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1a and b](/articles/57950/figures#fig1s1)). Similar results PBMCs stimulated in vitro ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1c and d](/articles/57950/figures#fig1s1)). Next, we used in vitro stimulated control PBMCs obtained from five young donors (22-50 years old), bled on three different occasions, 2 weeks apart, were stimulated with either IFN/LPS, anti-CD40 /-IgM cells, respectively. Taken together, the data show: (a) autophagic flux varies little within one individual between blood draws; (b) there is limited variation between individuals; (c) bafilomycin A treatment leads to accumulation of LC3-II in all cell types; (d) the respective stimulations via TCR/BCR/TLR or IFN-R weakly induce autophagic flux which is consistently further increased in the presence of bafilomycin A. Published human studies so far have limited their analysis of TCR-induced autophagy to non-specific stimulation in vitro such as anti-CD3/CD28. Here, we took advantage of an existing cohort of healthy human donors that were vaccinated with a candidate HCV vaccine encoding HCV non-structural proteins (NSmut). Healthy volunteers received an adenoviral vector prime vaccination (ChAd3-NSmut or Ad6-NSmut) followed by a heterologous adenoviral boost vaccination measured at the peak magnitude of the T cell response to vaccination (2-4 weeks post Ad, 1 week post MVA) HCV-specific CD8+ T cells show a significant increase in autophagic flux that is not observed in HCV non-specific CD8+ cells ( [Figure 1c](#fig1)). In antigen-specific T cells, autophagic flux is highest shortly after vaccination but had declined to levels equivalent to antigen-non-specific T cells cells by the end of the study (week 36 or 52). Together, these data show that antigen exposure induces autophagic flux in the antigen-reactive CD8+ T cell subset in humans in vivo. In previous work, we found that autophagic flux was reduced in CD8+ T cells from 24-month-old mice 12. To test whether this is true in human CD8+ T cells from human individuals, and whether this correlates with vaccine immunogenicity, we measured autophagic flux in vaccinees of various ages that were given an experimental RSV vaccine ( [Figure 1a](#fig1) and [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4](/articles/57950/figures#fig1s4)). As older adults are particularly susceptible to severe disease from RSV infection, the vaccine was given to two age groups (18-50 years and 60-75 years of age). As expected, the naturally derived population of RSV-specific IFN-producing CD8+ T cells in peripheral circulation in response to the infection declines with age ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5](/articles/57950/figures#fig1s5)). No MHC class I available for RSV to identify antigen-specific T cells; however, bulk T cells of the >60 year vaccinees showed significantly cells with IFN ELISpot responses in individual vaccinees and found a strong inverse correlation in the aged group ( [Figure 1e](#fig1)) between autophagy and IFN responses, but not in the young group ( [Figure 1f](#fig1)). Taken together these data suggest that reduced T cell autophagy in aged T cells may underpin reduced T cell responses to vaccination. To gain better insight into the role of autophagy in T cells function, we sorted and activated splenocytes from control and autophagy-deficient mice, in which the essential autophagy gene Atg7 was deleted with Cre driven by the CD4 promotor (Atg7cd4). Both intracellular IFN expression and ( [Figure 2a and b](#fig2)). Similarly, Atg7-deficient T cells ( [Figure 2c](#fig2)). Next, we sought to confirm our data in human T cells using pharmacological autophagic flux inhibitors, namely hydroxychloroquine (HcQ) that inhibits 2015](#bib8)). Using these drugs, we could recapitulate the data observed in the genetic mouse model of autophagy deletion showing an inhibition of Resveratrol (Res) ( [Rubinsztein et al., 2011](#bib39); [Morselli et al., 2010](#bib27)) in human CD8+ T cell the production of IFN and perforin ( [Figure 2g-i](#fig2)). In summary, these data suggest that autophagy is required for CD8+ T cell function by controlling IFN and perforin production. We have recently shown that treating old but not young mice with the metabolite spermidine improves autophagy levels in B lymphocytes decline of endogenous spermidine ( [Zhang et al., 2019](#bib58)). Here, we sought to confirm this in human lymphocytes. Thus, we determined spermidine, spermine and putrescine levels in PBMCs by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and found an inverse correlation between age and spermidine but not with spermine or putrescine ( [Figure 3a](#fig3)). We hypothesized that low levels of spermidine are responsible for low levels of autophagy and poor T cell function in PBMCs from old donors. We therefore tested whether supplementation with spermidine recovers T cell autophagy and function. As activation of PBMCs with anti-CD3/CD28 optimally induces autophagy levels on day 4 ( [Watanabe et al., 2014](#bib52)), we activated PBMCs from old donors in the presence of spermidine for 4 days and tested their autophagic flux and function by flow cytometry. Both autophagic flux and the secretion of IFN measured by ELISA was improved significantly in T cells from older vaccinees ( [Figure 3b and c](#fig3)). Similarly, increased not of Moreover, to investigate whether spermidine acts through autophagy to improve CD8+ T cell function, we added spermidine together with pharmacological autophagy inhibitors. Indeed, the ( [Figure 3c-f](#fig3)). In contrast, spermine, another polyamine from the same pathway, which is not significantly reduced with age ( [Figure 3a](#fig3)) and does not serve as a direct substrate for eIF5A hypusination ( [Lee and Park, 2000](#bib20)), does not rescue T cell function from old donors ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1a-c](/articles/57950/figures#fig3s1)). These data underline the importance of cellular spermidine levels in aged CD8+ T cells. [see all](/articles/57950/figures#fig3) Polyamine biosynthesis has previously been shown to protein synthesis ( [Madeo et al., 2018](#bib23); al., 2020](#bib51)). Moreover, autophagy can ensure mitochondrial quality by selective degradation of damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria, a process called mitophagy, which is critical for maintaining cellular function ( [Palikaras et al., 2018](#bib30); [Vara-Perez et al., 2019](#bib50)). Since autophagy levels decline with age and damaged mitochondria accumulate in aged T cells ( [Bektas et al., 2019](#bib3); [Callender et al., 2020](#bib4)), we hypothesized that spermidine-induced autophagy may improve mitochondrial function in aged T cells. To test this, we measured mitochondrial function in CD8+ T cells isolated from old donors after spermidine treatment. We indeed show that mitochondrial mass was reduced after spermidine treatment as assessed by MitoTracker Green (MTG) and nonylacridine orange (NAO) staining, two fluorescent probes which have been commonly used to assess mitochondrial mass ( [Doherty and Perl, 2017](#bib7); The reduction of mitochondrial mass during spermidine treatment could be related to improved clearance of damaged mitochondria by mitophagy or decreased biogenesis. Damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria often show altered membrane potential and increased ROS) production ( [Puleston et al., 2014](#bib34)); however, we did not observe any changes in these parameters after spermidine treatment ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2c and d](/articles/57950/figures#fig3s2)). Our data suggest that spermidine treatment lowers mitochondrial content, presumably by mitophagy, but does not improve mitochondrial health. Mitochondria are not the only type of autophagic cargo and other cargos need to be investigated to understand exactly how autophagy induction improves T cell function. Next, we investigated whether endogenous polyamine maintains autophagy levels in activated CD8+ T cells from young donors. The drug DFMO polyamine of into Addition of DFMO almost completely blocked autophagy in CD8+ T cells activated over 7 days;, however, when cells were supplemented with spermidine autophagic flux recovered IFN and perforin expression in anti-CD3/CD28 activated CD8+ T cells, which can be rescued by spermidine ( [Figure 4b and c](#fig4)). As before, granzyme by DFMO or spermidine supplementation ( [Figure 4d](#fig4)). T cells from young donors, with their high endogenous spermidine levels, do not respond to spermidine supplementation 4e-g](#fig4)). We previously hypusination of eIF5A which regulates TFEB expression ( [Zhang et al., 2019](#bib58)), and we sought to test this pathway in human T cells. Spermidine provides a moiety to the translation factor eIF5A, which in addition to its role in initiation and termination also promotes the translation of polyproline-rich domains, which are difficult to translate ( [Gutierrez et al., 2013](#bib15)). One such triproline motif-containing protein is TFEB, with mouse TFEB containing one triproline motif while human TFEB contains two. TFEB is the key master transcription factor of autophagosomal and lysosomal gene expression 2015](#bib19); [Settembre et al., 2011](#bib44)). Here, we addressed whether this pathway operates in human T cells and accounts for the loss of autophagy and T cell function. We first verified in the human lymphocyte line Jurkat that the inhibitor of eIF5A ( [Figure 5a](#fig5)) and also confirmed that it a dose-dependent activated for 4 days ( [Figure 5c](#fig5)). It also diminishes the autophagic flux in activated CD8+ T cells over a time course of 7 days ( [Figure 5d](#fig5)). We then tested whether spermidine maintains eIF5A hypusination and TFEB levels in CD8+ T from donors by depleting endogenous spermidine with DFMO. While anti-CD3/CD28 increases expression and eIF5A, a reduction of hypusinated eIF5A and TFEB levels in PBMCs treated with DFMO observed, which is rescued with spermidine ( [Figure 5e](#fig5)). As expected, spermidine treatment of PBMCs from young donors demonstrated to have high levels of spermidine does not induce this pathway ( [Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/57950/figures#fig5s1)) nor T cell function ( [Figure 3e-g](#fig3)). Finally, we sought to address whether naturally low endogenous spermidine levels can be rescued in PBMCs from old donors activated with anti-CD3/CD28. Again, we observed that activation induces levels of protein expression of both hypusinated eIF5A and TFEB, and if TFEB is required for T cell function, we knocked out Tfeb in cultured mouse T cells ex vivo ( supplement 2a](/articles/57950/figures#fig5s2)). Interestingly, both expression were significantly decreased in Tfeb KO CD8+ T cells upon stimulation ( 2b and c](/articles/57950/figures#fig5s2)). cells failed to upregulate 5\u2014figure supplement 2b and c](/articles/57950/figures#fig5s2)). Analogous to previous observation, loss of TFEB had no impact on granzyme B expression ( [Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2d](/articles/57950/figures#fig5s2)). Taken together, these data suggest that TFEB itself is essential for T cell function and that spermidine was unable to improve T cell function when TFEB was knocked out. Discussion Several studies have addressed the induction of autophagy by antigenic stimulation in murine T cells in vivo and in response to anti-CD3/CD28 in vitro stimulation of human T cells ( [Macian, 2019](#bib22)). In mouse studies [Xu et al., 2014](#bib55) measured a peak in autophagy induction shortly after the CD8+ effector phase with subsequent failure to mount memory responses. In line with this, we and Xu et al showed that deletion of autophagy mostly affects T cells in the memory phase of CD8+ T cell responses as opposed to the effector phase ( [Xu et al., 2014](#bib55); [Puleston et al., 2014](#bib34)). The question remains whether it is initiation or maintenance of memory responses that are affected. Interestingly, the work of [Schlie et al., 2015](#bib42) showed that the memory response could be rescued by N-acetyl cysteine, arguing that memory cells may be formed but not maintained without autophagy. While it has been shown in human T cells that autophagy peaks after 4 days of anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation, later time points are more difficult to mimic accurately in vitro. Here, we show for the first time that antigenic encounter in vivo induces autophagy after the effector phase, arguing that autophagy may be important in human CD8+ T cells during the memory phase. Interestingly, we could not observe any bystander effect on CD8+ T cells that are not specific for HCV, suggesting that it is a cell-intrinsic effect through specific stimulation via their TCR. The role of autophagy in these long-term antigen-specific T cells remains still elusive; autophagy could either degrade molecules no longer needed comparable to the transcription factor PU.1 in Th9 cells ( [Rivera Vargas et al., 2017](#bib37)) or cell cycle regulator CDKN1 in the effector phase of CD8+ T cells ( [Jia et al., or organelles ( al., 2014](#bib34); [Jia et al., 2011](#bib16)). Alternatively, autophagy could provide building blocks including amino acids, free fatty acids and nucleotides that are important for the maintenance of essential cellular processes through provision of ATP ( [Shi et al., 2011](#bib46); [Pearce et al., 2009](#bib31)) or transcription and translation for T cell function or a combination of these mechanisms. Our data is in agreement with previous reports showing that spermidine increases the autophagy-dependent selective degradation of mitochondria (mitophagy) and thus contributes to mitochondrial health and functionality [Eisenberg et al., al., 2017](#bib10); [Qi et al., 2016](#bib36)). The positive impact on cellular mitochondrial content is in line with two recent studies showing that TFEB promotes autophagy and improves mitophagy turnover et al., 2019](#bib49); [Kim et al., 2018](#bib18)). With increasing life expectancy, the number of people over 60 years of age is expected to double by 2050, reaching 2.1 billion worldwide. The severity of many infections is higher in the older population compared to younger adults as particularly notable during the SARS2-CoV pandemic. Moreover, the success of childhood vaccination is widely recognized but the importance of vaccination of the older population is frequently underestimated ( [Weinberger, 2018](#bib53)). Immune responses to vaccines are known to be particularly ineffective in the older population and yet some vaccines such as for influenza and SARS2-Cov are primarily needed for the older adults. The development of drugs that improve vaccination in this expanding population is therefore an urgent socio-economic need. Targeting mTOR with Rapamycin was the first drug both in mice and in human clinical trials shown to have a beneficial effect on T cell responses in mice and older humans ( [Araki et al., 2009](#bib1); [Mannick et al., 2018](#bib24)). However, whether Rapamycin triggers autophagy at the administered dose has not been investigated. With this study we show for the first time that the autophagy-inducing drug spermidine has an immune boosting effect on the T cell compartment in humans in vitro and that low autophagy levels correlate with low responses to vaccination. The translation of TFEB is one of the limiting factors for sufficient autophagy levels required to mount an immune response. In addition, to be active, TFEB needs to be dephosphorylated for its translocation into the nucleus, which mTOR inhibition 2012](#bib45)). Therefore, spermidine and an mTOR inhibitor may have to be combined to optimally restore immune responses in the older adults. We find that spermidine levels decline in PBMCs in the older humans. This confirms earlier study in plasma in which spermidine levels were found to be low in the >65 age group and rising again in centenarians ( [Pucciarelli et al., 2012](#bib33)). Studies of this kind usually indicate that the phenotype is maladaptive with age as centenarians do not display many of the aging features of the age group below. However, the reasons for the age-related decline in spermidine in blood cells are not clear, and currently under investigation. Overall it is evident that endogenous spermidine maintains autophagy in human T cells, a novel metabolic pathway that has not been investigated before. Spermidine has recently been administered to humans in a small experimental trial with a beneficial effect on cognitive function without adverse effects ( [Schwarz et al., 2018](#bib43); [Wirth et al., 2019](#bib54)). It remains to be shown whether at such low doses it has an effect on autophagy. Our study provides a good starting point for a small experimental trial to assess whether spermidine can be used to improve vaccination efficiency in older adults. Furthermore, this trial could help to determine if eIF5A, TFEB and autophagy in PBMCs could be used as biomarkers for the antiaging effect of spermidine and related drugs during vaccination. Based on this information, the vaccination protocol in older adults could in the future be adjusted according to whether this pathway is functional in individual vaccinees. In conclusion, we validated a novel anti-immune senescence pathway in humans with druggable targets and biomarkers, which could also be used for other broader anti-aging drug trials.

On day 4, cells were re-stimulated with the same concentrations of anti-CD3/CD28 for 6 hr at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 1 g/mL brefeldin-A (Sigma-Aldrich). As a control, cells were left unstimulated. Following surface marker staining as described above, cells were fixed with 100 L Fixation buffer (eBioscience) for 20 min at RT in the dark. Next, cells were permeabilized with 100 L of 1x Permeabilization buffer (eBioscience) for 15 min in the dark at RT. Then, cells were resuspended in the intracellular antibody mix (anti-IFN-, anti-Granzyme B, anti-Perforin) and incubated for 30 min in the dark at RT. After being washed twice with Permeabilization buffer the cells were resuspended in 200 L of FACS buffer for analysis. MHC class I pentamer staining to identify antigen-specific CD8+ T cells ex vivo. PBMCs were washed in PBS and were stained with pentamers at room temperature (20 min) in PBS, washed twice in PBS before further mAb staining as described above. During analysis, stringent gating criteria were applied with doublet and dead cell exclusion to minimize nonspecific binding contamination. Western blot [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap57950?item=s4-11) Cells in suspension were washed with PBS and lysed using NP-40 lysis buffer containing proteinase inhibitors (Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma) on ice. After spinning down the debris, protein concentration in the supernatant was quantified by BCA Assay (23227, Thermo Fisher). Reducing Laemmli Sample Buffer was then added to the supernatant and heated at 100\u00b0C for 5 min. 5-20 \u00b5g was loaded for SDS-PAGE analysis. NuPAGE Novex 4-12% Bis-Tris gradient gel (Thermo Fisher) with MES running buffer (Thermo Fisher) was used. Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (IPFL00010, Millipore) and blocked with 5% skimmed were incubated with primary antibodies dissolved in 1% milk overnight and secondary antibodies dissolved in 1% milk with 0.01% SDS for imaging using the Odyssey CLx Imaging System. Data were analyzed using Image Studio Lite. Spermidine measurement in cell lysates by GC-MS [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap57950?item=s4-12) This protocol was used as published previously ( [Yu et al., 2017](#bib56)). Briefly, cells were washed with PBS and the pellet resuspended in lysis buffer (80% methanol + 5% Trifluoroacetic acid) spiked with 2.5 \u00b5M 1,7-diaminoheptane (Sigma). The cell suspension, together with acid-washed glass beads (G8772, Sigma), was transferred to a bead beater tube and homogenized in a bead beater (Precellys 24, Bertin Technologies) for four cycles (6500 Hz, 45 s) with 1 min of ice incubation between each cycle. The homogenized samples were centrifuged at 13,000 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was collected and dried overnight. For chemical derivatization, 200 \u00b5L trifluoroacetic anhydride was added to the dried pellet and incubated at 60\u00b0C for 1 hr, shaking at 1200 rpm. The derivatization product was dried, re-suspended in 30 \u00b5L isopropanol and transferred to glass loading-vials. The samples were analyzed using a GCxGC-MS system as described ( [Yu et al., 2017](#bib56)). The following parameters were used for quantification of the 1D-GC-qMS data: Slope: 1000/min, width: 0.04 s, drift 0/min and T. DBL: 1000 min without any smoothing methods used. Statistical analyses [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap57950?item=s4-13) Prism software (GraphPad) was used for statistical analyses. Data are represented as mean \u00b1 SEM. All comparative statistics were post-hoc analyses. Paired or unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test was used for comparisons between two normally distributed data sets with equal variances. Linear regression with a 95% confidence interval was used to assess the relationships between age and the expression of target proteins or spermidine levels, in which R ( [Lurie et al., 2020](#bib21)) was used to assess the goodness of fit and the p value calculated from F test was used to assess if the slope was significantly non-zero. p Values were used to quantify the statistical significance of the null hypothesis testing. *p0.05, **p0.01, ***p0.001, ****p0.0001, ns, not significant.

Acceptance summary: This paper involving autophagy and immune function is of high importance for the scientific community and public in general, especially in these times where the immune system is in a central focus. The paper now provide evidence that spermidine, in addition to its known healthful effects similar to those observed during caloric restriction including autophagy and protein deacetylation, it has the potential to become a new intervention for improving immune system health. Decision letter after peer review: Thank you for submitting your article \"Autophagy in T cells from aged donors is maintained by spermidine, and correlates with function and vaccine responses\" for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as eLife papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation. Your article provides robust evidence that spermidine administration reinvigorates T-Cell function and autophagy in cells from older subjects. We believe that the following suggested revisions will greatly improve the clarify of your manuscript and thus, we hope you can address these promptly before we can accept it for publication. Some of the major conclusions require a modest amount of additional data as pointed by reviewer #2 and an extended Discussion as suggested by reviewer #3. Especially the proposed link between mitochondrial function and the improvement in autophagy is not supported by data. Please incorporate data on mitochondrial function or discuss prior published work. In addition, kindly provide evidence to demonstrate that spermidine effects on INF and T-cell function are blunted when autophagy is blocked, as suggested by reviewer #3. Please find below the detailed suggestions from the reviewers. Reviewer #2: Simon and colleagues show that spermidine administration reinstalls autophagy and T-Cell function taken ex vivo from aged donors. They also point to hypusination and TFEB translation as an underlying mechanism. This is an intriguing and technically well done work and I have only a few suggestions for improvement. The data showing that in young donors Autophagy is blocked by DFMO and can be rescued by spermidine administration are impressive and should be mentioned in the Abstract. The sentence: \"Here, we show induction of autophagy is specifically induced in human vaccine-induced antigen-specific T cells in vivo\" is unclear and even flawed. The authors correctly point out that mitochondria/mitophagy/improved mitochondrial function could play a role in the phenotypes observed. They should either show markers of mitochondrial capacity/quality in their assays (e.g. respiration, mitophagy) or at least discuss this in the light of published works. Reviewer #3: The manuscript entitled \"Autophagy in T cells from aged donors is maintained by spermidine and correlates with function and vaccine responses\" shows that antigen exposure induces autophagic flux in CD8+ T cells in humans in vivo, and this induction declines with age. Moreover, it evidences that the autophagy-inducing metabolite spermidine, falls with age and when supplemented increases autophagy and T cell function in old T cells. The manuscript is overall well written and the message is potentially important. However, some conclusion are forced, and additional data are needed to support main author's conclusions. - The correlation between INF response and autophagic flux is positive in old, and negative in young individuals. The authors concluded that \"reduced autophagy in aged T cells may cause low T cell response to vaccination\". This is an interesting hypothesis that should be corroborated by direct evidences. For example, the authors should investigate INF response in T cells in which autophagy was stimulated/inhibited using different compounds that modulate autophagy through different mechanism of action. - The use of metabolite Spermidine has been previously shown to induce autophagy. However, the authors should include additional controls (i.e. other amino acid metabolites) to prove that the effects are indeed specific for spermidine. - Spermidine's mode of action via EiF5A and TFEB in human CD8+ T cells requires additional experiments, i.e. real time of TFEB genes targets upon spermidine administration. Can the authors inhibit TFEB in spermidine treated cells to formally prove the involvement of TFEB in spermidine activity? Indeed, spermidine can activate autophagy through different mechanisms. - There is no formal demonstration that Spermidine improve T-cell function through TFEB-mediated autophagy. The authors should use pharmacological inhibitors of autophagy to demonstrate that spermidine effects on INF and T-cell function are blunted when autophagy is blocked.

The data showing that in young donors Autophagy is blocked by DFMO and can be rescued by spermidine administration are impressive and should be mentioned in the Abstract. We thank the reviewer for his/her recommendation and added a sentence describing this observation in the Abstract. \"We demonstrate in human donors that levels of the endogenous autophagy-inducing metabolite spermidine fall in T cells with age. Spermidine supplementation of T cells from old donors recovers their autophagy level and function, similar to young donor cells, in which spermidine biosynthesis has been inhibited.\" The sentence: \"Here, we show of autophagy is specifically induced in human vaccine-induced antigen-specific T cells in vivo\" is unclear and even flawed.We apologize for the unclear sentence and we are happy to clarify it. We replaced the sentence with the following in the Abstract:\"Here, we show that autophagy is specifically induced in vaccine-induced antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in healthy human volunteers.\". The authors correctly point out that mitochondria/mitophagy/improved mitochondrial function could play a role in the phenotypes observed. They should either show markers of mitochondrial capacity/quality in their assays (e.g. respiration, mitophagy) or at least discuss this in the light of published works. We appreciate the reviewer's comment regarding the mitochondria. We addressed this point and added it to the Results, new Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2, Materials and methods and Discussion. \"Polyamine biosynthesis has previously been shown to increase mitochondrial protein synthesis (Madeo et al., 2018; Puleston et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020). [...] Mitochondria are not the only type of autophagic cargo and other cargos need to be investigated to understand exactly how autophagy induction improves T cell function.\" \"Our data is in agreement with previous reports showing that spermidine increases the autophagy-dependent selective degradation of mitochondria (mitophagy) and thus contributes to mitochondrial health and functionality (Eisenberg et al., 2016; Garcia-Prat et al., 2016; Fan et al., 2017; Qi et al., 2016). The positive impact on cellular mitochondrial content is in line with two recent studies showing that TFEB promotes autophagy and improves mitophagy turnover in neuronal and hepatocytes (Tan et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2018).\". \"Mitochondrial staining was performed after Live/Dead and surface marker staining by incubating cells at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min with 5 \u00b5M MitoSOX red, 37 \u00b0C for 25 min with 150 nM MitoTracker Green, 37 \u00b0C for 25 min with 100 nM nonylacridine orange (NAO) or at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min with 100 nM tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) (all from Thermo Fisher Scientific).\" Reviewer #3: The manuscript entitled \"Autophagy in T cells from aged donors is maintained by spermidine and correlates with function and vaccine responses\" shows that antigen exposure induces autophagic flux in CD8+ T cells in humans in vivo, and this induction declines with age. Moreover, it evidences that the autophagy-inducing metabolite spermidine, falls with age and when supplemented increases autophagy and T cell function in old T cells. The manuscript is overall well written and the message is potentially important. However, some conclusion are forced, and additional data are needed to support main author's conclusions. - The correlation between INF response and autophagic flux is positive in old, and negative in young individuals. The authors concluded that \"reduced autophagy in aged T cells may cause low T cell response to vaccination\". This is an interesting hypothesis that should be corroborated by direct evidences. For example, the authors should investigate INF response in T cells in which autophagy was stimulated/inhibited using different compounds that modulate autophagy through different mechanism of action. We appreciate the reviewer's comment and we hope the newly added data provides additional information on the effects of decreased autophagy on T cell function. To address this, we first used splenocytes from mice which were deleted for the essential autophagy gene Atg7 using the CD4Cre promotor. After stimulation, we found that autophagy loss leads to reduced IFN, Perforin and Granzyme B expression in comparison to autophagy-sufficient cells (new Figure 2A-C). In addition, we treated old and young blood cells with either autophagy inhibitors (Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)) and BSI-0206965 or with autophagy activators (Resveratrol) to assess their functional We cytokine staining to quantify IFN, Perforin and Granzyme and ELISA for soluble IFN in the supernatant (new Figure 2D-I). Our data shows that autophagy is important for T cell function. This was added to the Results, Materials and methods and new Figure 2. \"To gain better insight into the role of autophagy in T cells function, we sorted and activated splenocytes from control and autophagy-deficient mice, in which the essential autophagy gene Atg7 was deleted with Cre driven by the CD4 promotor (Atg7cd4). [...] In summary, these data suggest that autophagy is required for CD8+ T cell function by controlling IFN and perforin T cell assays and CD4-cre;Atg7-/- mice were cultured For anti-CD3/CD28 and 100 nM 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) for 4 days.\" - The use of metabolite Spermidine has been previously shown to induce autophagy. However, the authors should include additional controls (i.e. other amino acid metabolites) to prove that the effects are indeed specific for spermidine. Based on the reviewer's suggestion, we treated the cells with spermine, another amino acid metabolite from the same pathway. Spermine was unable to rescue T cell function from old donors (new Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1). This was added to the Results, Materials and methods and new Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 and is in line with our finding that spermine is not reduced with age (Figure 3A) and does not serve as substrate for eIF5A hypusination (Lee and Park, 2000). \"In contrast, spermine, another polyamine from the same pathway, which is not significantly reduced with age (Figure 3A) and does not serve as a direct substrate for eIF5A hypusination (Lee and Park, 2000), does not rescue CD8+ T cell function from old donors (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A-C). These data underline the importance of cellular spermidine levels in aged CD8+ T cells.\" - Spermidine's mode of action via EiF5A and TFEB in human CD8+ T cells requires additional experiments, i.e. real time of TFEB genes targets upon spermidine administration. Can the authors inhibit TFEB in spermidine treated cells to formally prove the involvement of TFEB in spermidine activity? Indeed, spermidine can activate autophagy through different mechanisms. We appreciate the reviewer's comment addressing the question of spermidine's mode of action acting via TFEB. In an attempt to address this comment, we tested the Amaxa nucleofector kit optimised for human T cells. Unfortunately, transfection efficiency for plasmids expressing GFP was just under 16%, and no significant reduction of Tfeb mRNA was observed when primary human T cells were transfected with siTfeb for 3 days. Instead, we obtained inducible Tfeb knockout splenic T cells from Andrea Ballabio's lab. We tested several culture conditions and found an optimal protocol for inducing Tfeb knockout in these T cells ex vivo. Upon 100 nM 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) treatment for 4 days, T cells stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 achieved a good inhibition (new Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A).Functionally, IFNsecretionwassignificantlyreducedasmeasured in culture supernatants with or without spermidine (new Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B). Taken together, these data suggest that TFEB is required for T cell function and that spermidine supplementation did not improve T cell function in this condition. This was added to the Results, Materials and methods and new Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2. \"To investigate if TFEB is required for T cell function, we knocked out Tfeb in cultured mouse T cells ex vivo (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A). [...] Taken together, these data suggest that TFEB itself is essential for T cell function and that spermidine was unable to improve T cell function when TFEB was knocked out.\"\"Mice T cell assays Splenocytes or CD4-cre;Atg7+/+ For (4-OHT) 4-OHT- inducible Tfeb splenic T anti-CD3/CD28 and 100 nM 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) for 4 days.\" - There is no formal demonstration that Spermidine improve T-cell function through TFEB-mediated autophagy. The authors should use pharmacological inhibitors of autophagy to demonstrate that spermidine effects on INF and T-cell function are blunted when autophagy is blocked. We want to thank the reviewer for this comment and have added the requested experiment to the manuscript in the new Figure 3 with text in the Results and Materials and methods. In this figure we show that inhibition of autophagy using either HcQ or Sbl blocks spermidine-induced production of IFN measured in the supernatant or in each cell by flow cytometry. Interestingly, we observe similar changes for Perforin, whereas Granzyme B remains unchanged, similar to what we observed for the other assays. This data suggests the significance of autophagy in T cell function and cytokine secretion. \"Moreover, to investigate whether spermidine acts through autophagy to improve CD8+ T cell function, we added spermidine together with pharmacological autophagy inhibitors. Indeed, the rejuvenating spermidine supplementation in old donor cells (Figure 3C-F).\" [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.57950.sa2](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.57950.sa2) Article and author information Author details Funding Wellcome (WT109665MA) - Anna Katharina Simon National Institute for Health Research - Paul Klenerman Oxford Biomedical Research Center - Paul Klenerman The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) plays an essential role as a transcription factor in driving the expression of immune response genes during infection. The striking difference in functional output with other IRFs is that IRF1 also drives the expression of various cell cycle inhibiting factors, making it an important tumor suppressor. Thus, it is critical to regulate the abundance of IRF1 to achieve a 'Goldilocks' zone in which there is sufficient IRF1 to prevent tumorigenesis, yet not too much which could drive excessive immune activation. Using genetic screening, we identified the E3 ligase receptor speckle type BTB/POZ protein (SPOP) to mediate IRF1 proteasomal turnover in human and mouse cells. We identified S/T-rich degrons in IRF1 required for its SPOP MATH domain-dependent turnover. In the absence of SPOP, elevated IRF1 protein levels functionally increased IRF1-dependent cellular responses, underpinning the biological significance of SPOP in curtailing IRF1 protein abundance. - - Immunology and Inflammation Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are rising rapidly in urbanizing populations in sub-Saharan Africa. Assessment of inflammatory and metabolic characteristics of a urbanizing African population and the comparison with populations outside Africa could provide insight in the pathophysiology of the rapidly increasing epidemic of NCDs, including the role of environmental and dietary changes. Using a proteomic plasma profiling approach comprising 92 inflammation-related molecules, we examined differences in the inflammatory proteome in healthy Tanzanian and healthy Dutch adults. We show that healthy Tanzanians display a pro-inflammatory phenotype compared to Dutch subjects, with enhanced activity of the Wnt/-catenin signalling pathway and higher concentrations of different metabolic regulators such as 4E-BP1 and fibroblast growth factor 21. Among the Tanzanian volunteers, food-derived metabolites were identified as an important driver of variation in inflammation-related molecules, emphasizing the potential importance of lifestyle changes. These findings endorse the importance of the current dietary transition and the inclusion of underrepresented populations in systems immunology studies. "}
