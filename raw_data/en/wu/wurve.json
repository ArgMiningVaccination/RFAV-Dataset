At the Toronto Functional Medicine Centre (TFMC), our health practitioners offer integrated health care, which may potentially influence optimal function, while contributing to positive effects on energy levels, chronic pain, and post-disease symptoms. This is why we offer a wide range of modalities, including naturopathic medicine, acupuncture, Western medicine, and chelation therapy. Chelation therapy is an elective treatment that aims to rid the body of toxins. It works by detoxifying dangerous heavy metals that have been accrued in soft tissues. But how can heavy metals enter the human body to begin with? We discuss how these toxicities occur and important facts about chelation therapy treatments. Functional medicine approach to heavy metal toxicities Exposures to heavy metals are surprisingly commonplace \u2014 and when they occur, they can cause detriment to your cognitive function (brain fog), liver detoxification, immune cells, muscle function, and more. Here are some ways exposure to metal toxicities can happen: - When your job involves heavy metal materials (i.e. gasoline, paint, mining, pesticides) - Inhaling excessive levels of air pollutants or lead paint. - Consuming fish from mercury-containing waters - Dental amalgams - Drinking water that's contaminated from older piping - When kids touch or taste toys that contain lead - From using medications that require metal as a key ingredient Quick Tip Removing your shoes inside your home could impact optimal functioning by avoiding harmful toxins. This is because your shoes can drag in contaminants, such as dust, pesticides, bacteria, and viral cells. When your body collects dangerous metal toxins, this increases your risks for health complications, including kidney dysfunction, nervous system disorders, immune system dysfunction, cancers and different types of anemia, while encouraging dehydration, weakness, memory and breathing issues. If you think toxins are impeding your optimal hydration or wellness, you should know that chelation therapy is available in the GTA. Must-know chelation therapy details In our IV Lounge, we teach patients to nourish the body with nutrients, and chelation therapy is sometimes discussed. Here are some crucial facts to know about it: - You may be a candidate for it if you've tested positive for heavy metal overload, and have no contraindications to oral or IV chelation therapy. If you don't have a positive test result for heavy metals, yet you have symptoms that may be linked to this toxicity, you will be advised to get functional medicine lab tests conducted. One such test is a toxic element clearance profile, which measures for mercury, nickel, and other harmful elements in the body. It may be conducted while monitoring your clearance of toxins. - Chelation therapy uses therapeutic doses of chemical agents (i.e. ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) in pill form (oral supplementation) or as an intravenous infusion drip under special circumstances. When the chelating agent is in your body, it snatches metallic molecules from your body tissues (ie. connective tissue, epithelial tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue). Then the chemical is excreted via the kidneys through urination, which also eliminates metals. - EDTA and other chelators such DMSA and DMPS are used to remove toxic metals. But they may also remove healthy levels of \"good\" minerals required for optimal health, such as manganese, copper and zinc. Thus, it's important to work with your health practitioner to correct deficiencies linked to major minerals and key vitamins prior to and after a chelation session. - This treatment has also been given for cardiovascular issues, Alzheimer's and autism. However, scientists agree that further research is needed to confirm that chelation therapy is suitable for health conditions outside of heavy metal poisoning. - Kids, pregnant patients, and people with liver, kidney malfunction and heart failure cannot have chelation therapy administered due to safety reasons. Chelation therapy could improve your well-being, as it eliminates harmful substances that may be the root of your health worries. You might experience mental clarity in your daily routine or reduced nerve pain levels (peripheral neuropathy) when metals have been cleared. Once you have possible vitamin and mineral deficiencies alleviated, too, you can resume a healthy lifestyle. When left untreated, heavy metal poisoning could instigate additional issues, such as immune health concerns, irritable bowel syndrome, or ADHD. Please visit a functional medicine provider if you're worried about these toxicities. When you get a complete diagnostic session conducted at the TFMC, we can discuss testing for both heavy metal exposure and nutrient deficiencies. After all, the \"[d]eficiency of several essential nutrients, namely vitamins and essential elements [minerals], has been shown to exacerbate the toxic effects of metals,\" confirms research in the Journal of Nutritional and Environmental Medicine.
