Verywell Family / Peter Ardito As children grow, it's important for them to receive the vitamins and minerals needed for optimal health and development. The good news is, according to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, a vitamin or mineral supplement is not usually necessary for healthy children who consume a well-balanced diet. However, for some children, a multivitamin supplement can help fill the gaps and give you better peace of mind. \"I always prefer a child to get their nutrition through whole foods, fruits, and vegetables,\" says Muhammad Khan, MD, MPH, a pediatric gastroenterologist. \"However, I know there are instances where supplementation is necessary.\" Such instances include extremely picky eaters, children who are not growing well, children who follow strict vegan diets, or children who have dietary restrictions due to allergies. If your child falls into any of the above categories, a multivitamin may help fill nutritional gaps and ensure they are meeting their nutrition needs. When looking to find the best supplement for your child and family, there are several things to consider, including quality and safety, ingredients, key nutrients, and dosing. In order to recommend the best children's vitamins on the market, our pediatric dietitian utilized the research and her experience working as a pediatric dietitian and consulted with trusted pediatric medical professionals. Madelyn Goodnight / Verywell Editor's Note Our team of registered dietitians reviews and evaluates every single supplement we recommend according to our dietary supplement methodology. From there, a registered dietitian on our Expert Review Board reviews each article for scientific accuracy. Megadoses of specific vitamins can be harmful and children may benefit more from individual vitamin supplements. Always speak with a healthcare professional before adding a supplement to your routine to ensure that the supplement is appropriate for your individual needs, and to find out what dosage to take.

It contains 15 essential nutrients, including vitamins D3 and K for bone health and B12, omega-3 fatty acids, and choline for cognitive development. For children with allergies, these are a great option as they are free from milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, gluten, and wheat. They are also free of synthetic colors and flavors, instead containing natural flavors and coloring from organic black carrot juice and turmeric. While SmartyPants Multivitamins do contain 5 grams of added sugar per serving, many parents and healthcare providers prefer the organic cane sugar in SmartyPants to artificial sweeteners or high fructose corn syrup. Like most multivitamins, these do not contain iron or calcium, so you will need to ensure your child is receiving adequate iron and calcium for their age. Designed for children ages 4 and older, the recommended dose is four gummies per day. Price at time of publication: $18 ($0.60 per serving)Key Specs:Quantity: 120 count | Daily Dosage: 4 gummies | Type: Gummy | Age Rec: 4 years old and up The 7 Best Baby Cereals of 2023, According to a Dietitian Gummy Vitamins & Dental Health Dr. Joshua B. Austein, DMD, says, \"Gummy vitamins that have any sugar content can potentially be a risk for dental cavities. The risk is due to the sticky nature of these products getting stuck in the grooves and pits of teeth. The longer the sugar is held on the teeth, the higher the chance of cavity formation. This risk is the consequence of bacterial consumption of these sugars producing an acidic byproduct causing the breakdown of our tooth structure.\"If you do choose a gummy vitamin, Austein adds, \"The faster we can remove these from the teeth, the better. Rinsing with water, gently brushing, or picking them out of the grooves would be beneficial.\" Best Subscription Ritual Essential for Kids Multivitamin 4+ Ritual View On Ritual.com Pros Contains omega-3s Third-party tested Vegan-friendly Cons Contains a prebiotic fiber blend that may not be suitable for children with IBS If you're looking for a great multivitamin for kids with a monthly subscription option, Ritual's Essential for Kids 4+ is an excellent option. This gummy multivitamin is formulated with key nutrients, targeting common nutritional gaps in order to support growth and development, and leaving out certain vitamins and minerals that are abundant in foods. Ritual has covered their bases with zinc, vitamin D3, and vitamin C for immune support; choline and omega-3 fatty acids for brain health; vitamins D and K for growing bones and a fiber/prebiotic blend. They did, however, leave out iron and calcium, so take note if your child needs to supplement these minerals. If you are concerned about your child's sugar intake, these sugar-free gummies are sweetened with monk fruit, a naturally derived sweetener that's less sweet than other alternative sweeteners. However, monk fruit has a distinct flavor and may not be as palatable for some children. Suitable for kids ages four and up, the gummies are non-GMO, free of artificial colorants and synthetic fillers, and third-party tested for heavy metals, microbes, allergens, and other contaminants. Price at time of publication: $33 ($0.90 per serving) Key Specs:Quantity: 90 count | Daily Dosage: 3 gummies | Type: Gummy | Age Rec: 4 years old and up Sugar-Free Gummy Vitamins & Dental Health Dr. Austein says, \"The stickiness of the vitamin could potentially cause non-retentive or poorly bonded filings to dislodge. However, in terms of cavities, if there is no sugar or carbohydrate content, there will be no food source for the bacteria to cause the acidic byproduct, therefore no cavity risk. One exception would be if the gummy itself were acidic, that as well could cause tooth structure breakdown.\" While some gummy vitamins contain citric acid, an acidic ingredient, it is typically in small amounts, and tooth breakdown typically occurs with high amounts of citric acid exposure over time. \"Dental cavities are the number one chronic childhood illness, so having strong, more resistant teeth, good home care, a well-balanced diet, and routine dental visits are imperative to oral and overall health.\" He adds, \"I am a big believer in fluoride. At the proper doses, the health benefits are known to be significant.\" So you may want to consider a fluoride-containing toothpaste or rinse for your child to strengthen tooth enamel.

If your child is eating iron-fortified foods or eating enough foods naturally high in iron, they may not benefit from a iron containing supplement. This multivitamin is free of allergens including eggs, fish, and diary but does contain wheat, so it is not suitable for children with a gluten allergy. While this vitamin is free of added sugar, it does contain small amounts of sugar alcohols.

Renzo's includes 18 key nutrients, including iron, zinc, iodine, and vitamins A, C, D3, and K, to name a few. As one of the few supplements containing iron, this can be a great option for those kiddos that lean toward a meat-free lifestyle. Like the other options, this pick also leaves out calcium. Renzo's assures consumers that all of their products are third-party tested. While the product is sugar-free, it does contain sugar alcohols xylitol and mannitol, which may cause stomach upset, especially when consumed in large amounts.

With 16 vitamins and minerals, ChildLife can be given to babies as young as 6 months and kids as old as 12 years (with a pediatrician's recommendation, of course).

While no iron is included, it does contain a very small amount of calcium (55 milligrams). This product is certified gluten-free by NSF and developed by a pediatrician. It is also third-party tested for identity, purity and strength.

Megadoses of specific vitamins can be harmful\u2014this is why it is critical to ensure the one you choose is formulated for kids and dosed appropriately. According to the National Center of Health Statistics at the CDC, approximately one-third of children in the United States are consuming vitamin and mineral supplements, most often in the form of a multivitamin. These supplements can help fill nutrition gaps for children that need them most, but they also have the potential to lead to overconsumption of certain nutrients. It is important to remember that children receiving a nutrient-rich, well-balanced diet usually do not need additional vitamin supplementation. Children with limited diets: Children who follow restrictive diets to manage health conditions or for ethical reasons and children who tend to be very selective with what they are comfortable eating are at a much higher risk for missing out on key nutrients to support growth and development. These children may benefit from multivitamin supplements. Individual nutrient supplementation: Some children may not need a multivitamin and may instead benefit from individual vitamin supplements. For example, children who do not consume four 8-ounce servings of vitamin D fortified milk or fortified dairy alternatives may need to supplement with vitamin D. Additionally, children who follow well-balanced vegan diets will, at minimum, need to supplement with vitamin B12 but may not need a full multivitamin. How We Select Supplements Our team works hard to be transparent about why we recommend certain supplements; you can read more about our dietary supplement methodology here. We support supplements that are evidence-based and rooted in science. We value certain product attributes that we find to be associated with the highest quality products. We prioritize products that are third-party tested and certified by one of three independent third-party certifiers: USP, NSF, or ConsumerLab.com. It's important to note that the FDA does not review dietary supplements for safety and effectiveness before they go to market. Our team of experts has created a detailed, science-backed methodology to choose the supplements we recommend. Additionally, we interviewed the following experts: Pediatric Gastroenterologist, Muhammad Khan, MD, MPH, Director of Interventional and Diagnostic Endoscopy at Nationwide Children's Hospital Pediatric Dentist, Joshua B. Austein, DMD Olivia Mayer, RD, CSP, IBCLC, a Clinical Dietitian at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford. What to Look For Third-Party Testing Supplements that are third-party tested are sent to a lab where they are tested to ensure they contain what they say they contain and are not contaminated with specific high-risk, common contaminants. However, it's important to note: Third-party testing does not test to see if a product is effective or safe for everyone, and it does not ensure the supplement will not interact with other supplements or medications.Not all third-party testing is created equal. It is not uncommon for supplement companies to pay labs for certificates after conducting minimal to no testing. The third-party certifications we can trust are: ConsumerLab.com, NSF, and USP. However, these certifications are difficult to obtain and/or expensive for manufacturers, so many companies choose not to get their products tested by one of these three organizations. Sometimes products tested by these three companies are more expensive to try to offset the cost they pay for certification.Just because a supplement is not tested by one of these three companies, it does not mean it's a bad product. We recommend doing some research on the reputability of the manufacturer and calling up the manufacturer and their testing lab to determine their protocols and decide if you feel comfortable consuming the supplement. Form Vitamin and mineral supplements come in a variety of different forms, including gummies, chewable tablets, liquids, and even powders. Choosing the best form for your child is almost equally as important as choosing the right nutrients and dosing. If your child won't take it, what's the point? If they don't like food sticking to their teeth or have trouble chewing a gummy, consider finding a supplement that is a liquid or powder instead. Ingredients & Potential Interactions It is essential to carefully read the ingredient list and nutrition facts panel of a supplement to know which ingredients and how much of each ingredient is included relative to the recommended daily value of that ingredient. Please bring the supplement label to a healthcare provider to review the different ingredients contained in the supplement and any potential interactions between these ingredients and other supplements and medications your child is taking. Ideally, a healthcare provider makes a vitamin and mineral supplement recommendation based on a child's individual needs. \"I work with families to best understand what their child may be missing in their daily intake and formulate my recommendation based on those findings. Key nutrients in question usually include vitamin D and iron. Sometimes we see a need for vitamin B12 if the child eats little to no meat,\" says Olivia Mayer, RD, CSP, IBCLC, a clinical dietitian at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford. If you do not have specific nutrient recommendations from a healthcare provider, it is important to know what nutrients to look for that might be inadequate in your child's diet. Key nutrients to pay close attention to include: vitamin D3, vitamin A, vitamin C, B vitamins, vitamin K, zinc, and choline. If your child is following a vegetarian or vegan diet, other nutrients to think about would be iron, vitamin B12, calcium, and omega-3 fatty acids. Calcium is a large mineral, and therefore, if included in the multivitamin at the recommended daily amount for children, the multivitamin would be quite large. Calcium also tends to inhibit absorption of other minerals, such as iron, when packaged together, another reason you are less likely to find calcium included in your child's multivitamin. Food is the best way to get calcium. To ensure your child is meeting their daily calcium needs, include high-calcium foods in your child's daily intake, such as milk, yogurt, cheese, and dark green vegetables, as well as calcium-fortified fruit juices and dairy alternatives. Iron deficiency can occur in young children and is something your pediatrician is likely monitoring. Some children's multivitamins do contain iron, while some do not. Children need anywhere from 7 to 15 milligrams of iron daily to meet their needs, depending on age. Iron is naturally found in many foods and is also added to some fortified foods. Lean meat, seafood, and poultry are your best iron sources. You can also find iron in fortified cereals, beans, and leafy green vegetables. If your child were to be consuming iron-rich foods as well as an iron-containing supplement, too much iron can cause constipation and other gastrointestinal issues. Iron supplements are generally only recommended for children not meeting their iron needs by food alone. Bottom Line: It is essential to carefully read the ingredient list and nutrition facts panel of a supplement to know which ingredients and how much of each ingredient is included relative to the recommended daily value of that ingredient. Bring the supplement label to a healthcare provider to review the different ingredients contained in the supplement and any potential interactions between these ingredients and other supplements and medications your child is taking. You may want to opt for formulas with limited or no added sugars and no artificial sweeteners, colors, flavorings, or preservatives. Calcium and iron are two minerals that are important for growing bodies. However, they are often left off ingredient lists when children's multivitamins are formulated. There are a couple of reasons for this. Children's Vitamins Dosage Consider your child's age when selecting the best supplement for them. Be aware that some products are formulated for toddlers, while others are for older children and teens. Read ingredient labels, and look for products that do not exceed 100% of the daily value of individual vitamins and minerals, as more is not always better. You may notice that some of our multivitamins picks have slightly higher than 100% daily value for certain B vitamins and vitamin C, which are water-soluble vitamins that your body does not store, so toxicity risk is low, and more may be needed to maintain optimal status. Follow the age guidelines outlined on the product packaging, and speak with a healthcare provider to ensure that the product and dosage are appropriate to meet your child's needs. How Much Is Too Much? There is no benefit to getting excess amounts of any vitamin or mineral. In fact, in certain situations, it can even be dangerous. Some vitamins, such as the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K, may be harmful if they are over-consumed, as these are stored in body tissue. Some minerals, including zinc and iron, can also be harmful in high doses. Water-soluble vitamins, including C and B, are not stored in body tissue, and excess amounts are excreted through urine, so there is a lower risk of toxicity. However, children should not exceed the ULs (Tolerable Upper Intake Level) for any individual vitamins and minerals, as outlined by the National Institutes of Health. A few important takeaways when selecting a supplement is to ensure the product formulation is age-appropriate, that any and all supplements are stored out of reach of children, and that you follow dosing instructions as outlined on the product label. Be sure that children do not view gummy vitamins as candy which may cause them to consume more than the recommended amount. Frequently Asked Questions Can adults take children's vitamins? While it is safe for adults to take children's vitamins, the specific vitamin and mineral amounts may be insufficient for the needs of an adult. Be sure to check the nutrient doses on the vitamins and be sure they are adequate, adjust your dose accordingly, or add specific supplements as needed to meet your needs. As far as multivitamins Can children's multivitamins cause constipation? Similar to taking any new medication or supplement, certain side effects are possible. Side effects that have been associated with vitamin and mineral supplements include constipation, diarrhea, nausea, or upset stomach. If your child becomes constipated after starting a multivitamin, it is likely due to the calcium or iron included. Be sure to speak with a healthcare provider to determine if there are dietary or other changes you can implement to ease the problem, such as increasing fiber, drinking more fluids, or adjusting your multivitamin of choice. When should kids start taking a multivitamin? Remember, a multivitamin is not always needed, especially if your child is healthy and eating a varied diet that incorporates fruits, vegetables, fats, protein, legumes, diary and whole grains. Even if your child experiences phases of picky eating, they may not necessarily need a multivitamin. However, if you are concerned your child is not meeting their vitamin and mineral needs, a multivitamin can be a safe way to fill the gaps and provide peace of mind.If you do choose to give your child a multivitamin, experts recommend waiting until your child is 4 years old to start a multivitamin supplement. However, some children's multivitamins are formulated for children 2 years of age and older. If a healthcare provider recommends a multivitamin due to extreme picky eating, growth concerns, limited diets, or dietary restrictions, be sure to choose one that is designed for your child's age group and provides 100% of the Daily Value or less of vitamins and minerals, and does not exceed the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for any nutrient, based on the child's age. Remember, multivitamins are meant to fill gaps in the diet, so you don't necessarily need 100% Daily Value of all nutrients from a multivitamin, as they will still be getting additional nutrients from food. In addition, keep multivitamins out of your child's reach, and make it clear that they are not candy.
