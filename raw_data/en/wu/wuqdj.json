FIELD OF THE SUBJECT TECHNOLOGY [002] Anti-IL-6 antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof are used to reduce C-reactive protein (\"CRP levels\") and inflammation and in methods and compositions for the treatment and prevention of psoriatic arthritis (PsA). BACKGROUND Interleukin-6 (IL-6) [003] Interleukin-6 (\"IL-6\") is a multifunctional cytokine involved in numerous biological processes such as the regulation of the acute inflammatory response, the modulation of specific immune responses including B- and T-cell differentiation, bone metabolism, thrombopoiesis, epidermal proliferation, menses, neuronal cell differentiation, neuroprotection, aging, cancer, and the inflammatory reaction occurring in Alzheimer's disease. See Papassotiropoulos, et al. (2001) Neurobiology is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine, which regulates the acute phase response and the transition from the innate to the adaptive immune response. IL-6 increases hepatic synthesis of proteins that are involved in the 'acute phase response' leading to symptoms such as fever, chills, and fatigue. It stimulates B cell differentiation and secretion of antibodies and prevents apoptosis of activated B cells. IL-6 activates and induces proliferation of T cells and in the presence of IL-2, induces differentiation of mature and immature CD8 T cells into cytotoxic T cells. IL-6 is also involved in the differentiation of Th 17 cells and IL-17 production and inhibits regulatory T cells (Treg) differentiation. IL-6 also activates osteoclasts, synoviocytes, neutrophils, and other hematopoietic cells. Park, et al. (2007) Bulletin of the NYU Hospital for Joint Diseases 65 (suppl I): S4-10; Guerne, et al. (1989) J al. (1988) IL-6 is a member of a family of cytokines that promote cellular responses through a receptor complex consisting of at least one subunit of the signal-transducing glycoprotein gpl30 and the IL-6 receptor (\"IL-6R\") (also known as gp80). The IL-6R may also be present in a soluble form (\"sIL-6R\"). IL-6 binds to IL-6R, which then dimerizes See Jones (2005) Immunology 175: 3463-3468. [006] In humans, the gene encoding IL-6 is organized in five exons and four introns, and maps to the short arm of chromosome 7 at 7p21. Translation of IL-6 RNA and post-translational processing I WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 result in the formation of a 21 to 28 kDa protein with 184 amino acids in its mature form. See Papassotiropoulos, et al. (2001) Neurobiology of Aging 22:863-871. [007] The function of IL-6 is not restricted to the immune response as it acts in hematopoiesis, thrombopoiesis, osteoclast formation, elicitation of hepatic acute phase response resulting in the elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) protein. It is known to be a growth factor for epidermal keratinocytes, renal mesangial cells, myeloma and plasmacytoma Natl et al. (1988) Nature 332: 83-85. IL-6 is produced by a wide range types including monocytes/macrophages, fibroblasts, epidermal T and B-cells and some tumor cells. Akira, et al. (1990) FASEB J. 4(11): 2860-2867. Except for tumor cells that constitutively produce IL-6, normal cells do not express IL-6 unless appropriately stimulated. [008] Elevated IL-6 levels have been observed in many types of cancer, including breast cancer, leukemia, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, lymphoma, lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and multiple myeloma (e.g., Chopra et al. al. (1992) Cancer Research 52: 3317-3322: Nikiteas et al. (2005) World J. Gasterenterol. 11:1639-1643; reviewed in Heikkila et al. (2008) Eur J Cancer 44:937-945). Clinical studies (reviewed in Trikha et al. (2003) Clinical Cancer Research 9: 4653-4665) have shown some improvement in patient outcomes due to administration of various anti- 1L-6 antibodies, particularly in those cancers in which IL-6 plays a direct role promoting cancer cell proliferation or survival. [009] As noted above, IL-6 stimulates the hepatic acute phase response, resulting in increased production of CRP and elevated serum CRP levels. For this reason, C-reactive protein (CRP) has been reported to comprise a surrogate marker of IL-6 activity. Thus, elevated IL-6 activity can be detected through measurement of serum CRP. Conversely, effective suppression of IL-6 activity, e.g., through administration of a neutralizing anti-IL-6 antibody, can be detected by the resulting decrease in serum CRP levels. Although no diagnostic blood tests available for psoriatic arthritis, elevated CRP levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are known markers of inflammation and may reflect the severity of inflammation in the joints experienced in psoraitic arthritis.

Psoriatic Arthritis [010] Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory arthritis that occurs in individuals with psoriasis. It is estimated that about 1-3% of the general population and approximately 4.5 million patients in the United States have psoriasis. Between 10 and 30% of the psoriatic patients develop arthritis. PsA is a chronic inflammatory disease. The pathogenesis of PsA is not fully understood. Both genetic predisposition and environmental triggers are implicated in the deregulation of immune 2 WO 2015/054293PCT/US2014/059543 functions involved in PsA.

Mease (2006) Bulletin of the NYU Hospital for Joint Diseases. 65(1-2): 25-31. Without appropriate management, the number of joints affected by PsA and the severity of joint damage increase over time, which can lead to marked restrictions of the daily activities and to substantially compromised quality of life. Evidence has shown that accelerated atherosclerosis, obesity, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease are associated with active PsA. Other co-morbidities such as pulmonary fibrosis, uveitis, and, less commonly, aorta and aortic valve inflammation also contribute to complexity of Mease (2005) Expert Opin. Biol.

Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapies are efficacious for both skin and joint diseases but approximately 40% of patients treated with anti-TNF agents do not show at least minimal improvement and a large portion of patients do not achieve substantial relief.

For example, several effective rheumatoid arthritis therapies do not provide the relief in PsA, leaving anti-TNF agents as the only class of approved biologic therapy for PsA. Several agents under development for PsA had good efficacy for psoriatic skin lesions but with less optimal joint efficacy.

New medications that block an inflammatory protein called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are becoming the treatment of choice for Occasionally, may be injected with steroid medications. A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia (June 29, 2011). However, many patients do not experience relief from psoriatic arthritis with DMARDs or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Therefore, there is still significant unmet need in PsA for therapies that provide higher levels of efficacy in a greater proportion of patients for both joints and skin along with the additional attributes of durability of effect over time, low immunogenicity, a subcutaneous dosing regimen that may allow for less frequent administration, and a risk benefit profile that remains acceptable. [014] Data suggest that IL-6 plays an important role in the pathogenesis that leads to the joint inflammation as well as the characteristic skin lesions associated with psoriasis arthritis.

Circulating IL-6 levels were significantly higher in PsA patients and correlated highly with ESR and CRP. IL-6 levels also strongly correlated with disease activities such as the number of painful and swollen joints, physician's assessments as well as psoriasis area and severity index (PASI). Spadaro, et al. (1996) Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology 14: 413-416. The histopathology of psoriatic skin lesions is characterized by epidermal hyperplasia and inflammation. Studies have shown IL-6 mRNA and protein levels are elevated in psoriatic plaques. IL-6 was also shown to stimulate keratinocyte proliferation in vitro and contribute to the plaque formation. IL-6 signaling in psoriasis was also shown to prevent immune suppression by regulatory T cells. Neuner, et al. (1991) The Journal of Investigative Dermatology 97(1): 27-33. Arican, et al.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0158] FIGURE I shows alignments of variable light and variable heavy sequences between a rabbit antibody variable light and variable heavy sequences and homologous human sequences and the humanized sequences. Framework regions are identified FR1-FR4. Complementarity determining regions are identified as CDR1-CDR3. Amino acid residues are numbered as shown. The initial rabbit sequences are called RbtVL and RbtVH for the variable light and variable heavy sequences respectively. Three of the most similar human germline antibody sequences, spanning from Framework I through to the end of Framework 3, are aligned below the rabbit sequences. The human sequence that is considered the most similar to the rabbit sequence is shown first. In this example those most similar sequences are L12A for the light chain and 3-64-04 for the heavy chain. Human CDR3 sequences are not shown. The closest human Framework 4 sequence is aligned below the rabbit Framework 4 sequence. The vertical dashes indicate a residue where the rabbit residue is identical with at least one of the human residues at the same position. The bold residues indicate that the human residue at that position is identical to the rabbit residue at the same position. The final humanized sequences are called VLh and VHh for the variable light and variable heavy sequences respectively. The underlined residues indicate that the residue is the same as the rabbit residue at that position but different than the human residues at that position in the three aligned human sequences. [0159] FIGURES 2 and 3 show alignments between a rabbit antibody light and variable heavy sequences and homologous human sequences and the humanized sequences. Framework regions are identified as FR1-FR4. Complementarity determining regions are identified as CDR1-CDR3.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Definitions [0180] It is to be understood that this subject technology is not limited to the particular methodology, protocols, cell lines, animal species or genera, and reagents described, as such may 29 WO 2015/054293PCT/US2014/059543 vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the present subject technology which will be limited only by the appended claims. [0181] As used herein the singular forms \"a\", \"and\", and \"the\" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to \"a cell\" includes a plurality of such cells and reference to \"the protein\" includes reference to at least one proteins and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art, and so forth. All technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood to one of ordinary skill in the art to which this subject technology belongs unless clearly indicated otherwise. [0182] Amplification as used herein refers broadly to the amplification of polynucleotide sequences is the in vitro production of multiple copies of a particular nucleic acid sequence. The amplified sequence is usually in the form of DNA. A variety of techniques for carrying out such amplification are known in the art. See, e.g., Van Brunt (1990) Bio/Technol. 8(4): 291-294. Polymerase chain reaction or PCR is a prototype of nucleic acid amplification, and use of PCR herein should be considered exemplary of other suitable amplification techniques. [0183] Engineered, as used herein with an antibody, refers to a non-naturally occurring antibody produced by recombinant or genetic engineering methodologies known in the art or described herein. [0184] Antibody, as used herein, refers broadly to any polypeptide chain-containing molecular structure with a specific shape that fits to and recognizes an epitope, where at least one non-covalent binding interactions stabilize the complex between the molecular structure and the epitope. The archetypal antibody molecule is the immunoglobulin, and all types of immunoglobulins, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE, IgD, from all sources, e.g., human, rodent, rabbit, cow, sheep, pig, dog, chicken, are considered to be \"antibodies.\" Antibodies include but are not limited to chimeric antibodies, human antibodies and other non-human mammalian antibodies, humanized antibodies, single chain antibodies (scFvs), derived from and antibody fragments (e.g., Fabs, Fab', F(ab')2.) Numerous antibody coding sequences have been described; and others may be raised by methods well-known in the art. See Streltsov, et al. (2005) Protein Sci. 14(11): 2901-9; Greenberg, el al. (1995) Antigen-binding fragment, as used herein, refers broadly to a fragment of an antibody which recognizes an antigen (e.g., paratopes.) The antigen-binding fragment may comprise a paratope that may be a small region (e.g., 15-22 amino acids) of the antibody's Fv region and may contain parts of the antibody's heavy and light chains. See Goldsby, et al. Antigens (Chapter 3) Immunology (5th Ed.) New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 30 C-Reactive Protein (CRP ), as used herein, refers broadly to a 224 amino acid protein found in the blood that rise in response to inflammation (e.g., GenBank Protein Accession No. NP 000558 and SEQ ID NO: 726). CRP also encompasses any pre-pro, pro- and mature forms of this CRP amino acid sequence, as well as mutants and variants including allelic variants of this sequence. CRP levels, e.g. in the serum, liver, or elsewhere in the body, can be readily measured using routine methods and commercially available reagents, e.g. ELISA, antibody test strip, immunoturbidimetry, rapid immunodiffusion, visual agglutination, Western blot, Northern blot As mentioned above CRP levels may in addition be measured in patients having or at risk of developing thrombosis according to the subject technology. [0187] Coding sequence, as used herein refers broadly to an in-frame sequence of codons that (in view of the genetic code) correspond to or encode a protein or peptide sequence. Two coding sequences correspond to each other if the sequences or their complementary sequences encode the same amino acid sequences. A coding sequence in association with appropriate regulatory sequences may be transcribed and translated into a polypeptide. A polyadenylation signal and transcription termination sequence will usually be located 3' to the coding sequence. A \"promoter sequence\" is a DNA regulatory region capable of binding RNA polymerase in a cell and initiating transcription of a downstream (3' direction) coding sequence. Promoter sequences typically contain additional sites for binding of regulatory molecules (e.g., transcription factors) which affect the transcription of the coding sequence. A coding sequence is \"under the control\" of the promoter sequence or \"operatively linked\" to the promoter when RNA polymerase binds the promoter sequence in a cell and transcribes the coding sequence into mRNA, which is then in turn translated into the protein encoded by the coding sequence. A polynucleotide sequence \"corresponds\" to a polypeptide sequence if translation of the polynucleotide sequence in accordance with the genetic code yields the polypeptide sequence (i.e., the polynucleotide sequence \"encodes\" the polypeptide sequence), one polynucleotide sequence \"corresponds\" to another polynucleotide sequence if the two sequences encode the same polypeptide sequence. [0188] Complementarity determining region, hypervariable region, or CDR, as used herein refer broadly to at least one of the hyper-variable or complementarity determining regions (CDRs) found in the variable regions of light or heavy chains of an antibody (See Kabat, E. A. et al. (1987)Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.). These expressions include the hypervariable regions as defined by Kabat et al. (\"Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest,\" Kabat E., et al. (1983) US Dept, of Health and Human Services) or the hypervariable loops in 3-dimensional structures of antibodies. Chothia J Mol. Biol. 196: 901-917. The CDRs in each chain are held in close proximity by framework regions and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site. Within the CDRs there are select amino acids that have been described as the selectivity determining regions 31 WO 2015/054293PCT/US2014/059543 (SDRs) which represent the critical contact residues used by the CDR in the antibody-antigen interaction (Kashmiri (2005) Methods 36:25-34). CDRs for exemplary anti-IL-6 antibodies are provided herein. [0189] Disease or condition , as used herein, refers broadly to a disease or condition that a patient has been diagnosed with or is suspected of having, particularly a disease or condition associated with elevated IL-6. A disease or condition encompasses, without limitation thereto, psoriatic arthritis, as well as idiopathic conditions characterized by symptoms that include elevated IL-6. [0190] Effective amount, as used herein, refers broadly to an amount of an active ingredient that is effective to relieve or reduce to some extent at least one of the symptoms of the disease in need of treatment, or to retard initiation of clinical markers or symptoms of a disease in need of prevention, when the compound is administered. Thus, an effective amount refers to an amount of the active ingredient which exhibit effects such as (i) reversing the rate of progress of a disease; (ii) inhibiting to some extent further progress of the disease; and/or, (iii) relieving to some extent (or, preferably, eliminating) at least one symptoms associated with the disease. The effective amount may be empirically determined by experimenting with the compounds concerned in known in vivo and in vitro model systems for a disease in need of treatment. The context in which the phrase \"effective amount\" is used may indicate a particular desired effect. For example, \"an amount of an anti-IL-6 antibody effective to prevent or treat a hypercoagulable state\" and similar phrases refer to an amount of anti-IL-6 antibody that, when administered to a subject, will cause a measurable improvement in the subject's coagulation profile, or prevent, slow, delay, or arrest, a worsening of the coagulation profile for which the subject is at risk. Similarly, \"an amount of an anti-IL-6 antibody effective to reduce serum CRP levels\" and similar phrases refer to an amount of anti-IL-6 antibody that, when administered to a subject, will cause a measurable decrease in serum CRP levels, or prevent, slow, delay, or arrest, an increase in serum CRP levels for which the subject is at risk. Similarly, \"an amount of an anti-IL-6 antibody effective to increase serum albumin levels\" and similar phrases refer to an amount of anti-IL-6 antibody that, when administered to a subject, will cause a measurable increase in serum albumin levels, or prevent, slow, delay, or arrest, a decrease in serum albumin levels for which the subject is at risk. Similarly, \"an amount of an anti-IL-6 antibody effective to reduce weakness\" and similar phrases refer to an amount of anti-IL-6 antibody that, when administered to a subject, will cause a measurable decrease in weakness as determined by the hand grip strength test. Similarly, \"an amount of an anti-IL-6 antibody effective to increase weight\" and similar phrases refer to an amount of anti-IL-6 antibody that, when administered to a subject, will cause a measurable increase in a patient's weight. An effective amount will vary according to the weight, sex, age and medical history of the individual, as well as the severity of the patient's condition(s), the type of disease(s), mode of administration, and the like. An effective amount may be readily determined using routine experimentation, e.g., by titration (administration of increasing dosages until an effective dosage is found) and/or by reference to amounts that were effective for prior patients. 32 WO 2015/054293PCT/US2014/059543 Generally, the anti-IL-6 antibodies of the present subject technology will be administered in dosages ranging between about 0,1 mg/kg and about 20 mg/kg of the patient's body-weight. [0191] Expression Vector, as used herein, refers broadly to a DNA vectors contain elements that facilitate manipulation for the expression of a foreign protein within the target host cell. Conveniently, manipulation of sequences and production of DNA for transformation is first performed in a bacterial host, e.g. E. coli, and usually vectors will include sequences to facilitate such manipulations, including a bacterial origin of replication and appropriate bacterial selection marker. Selection markers encode proteins necessary for the survival or growth of transformed host cells grown in a selective culture medium. Host cells not transformed with the vector containing the selection gene will not survive in the culture medium. Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex media. Exemplary vectors and methods for transformation of yeast are described, for example, in Burke, D., Dawson, D., & Stearns, T. (2000). Methods in yeast genetics: a Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory course manual. Plainview, N.Y.: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. [0192] Folding, as used herein, refers broadly to the three-dimensional structure of polypeptides and proteins, where interactions between amino acid residues act to stabilize the structure. While non-covalent interactions are important in determining structure, usually the proteins of interest will have intra- and/or intermolecular covalent disulfide bonds formed by two cysteine residues. For naturally occurring proteins and polypeptides or derivatives and variants thereof, the proper folding is typically the arrangement that results in optimal biological activity, and can conveniently be monitored by assays for activity, e.g. ligand binding, enzymatic activity. [0193] Framework region or FR, as used herein refers broadly to at least one of the framework regions within the variable regions of the light and heavy chains of an antibody. See Kabat, et al. (1987) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. These expressions include those amino acid sequence regions interposed between the CDRs within the variable regions of the light and heavy chains of an antibody. As mentioned in the preferred embodiments, the FRs may comprise human FRs highly homologous to the parent antibody (e.g., rabbit antibody). [0194] gpl30 (also called Interleukin-6 receptor subunit beta), as used herein, refers broadly to a transmembrane protein that forms one subunit of type I cytokine receptors in the IL-6 receptor family (e.g., 918 precursor amino acid sequence available as Swiss-Prot Protein Accession No. P40189 and SEQ ID NO: 728). gpl30 also encompasses any pre-pro, pro- and mature forms of this amino acid sequence, such as the mature form encoded by amino acids 23 through 918 of the sequence shown, as well as mutants and variants including allelic variants of this sequence. 33 WO 2015/054293PCT/US2014/059543 [0195] Heterologous region or domain of a DNA construct, as used herein, refers broadly to an identifiable segment of DNA within a larger DNA molecule that is not found in association with the larger molecule in nature. Thus, when the heterologous region encodes a mammalian gene, the gene will usually be flanked by DNA that does not flank the mammalian genomic DNA in the genome of the source organism. Another example of a heterologous region is a construct where the coding sequence itself is not found in nature (e.g., a cDNA where the genomic coding sequence contains introns, or synthetic sequences having codons different than the native gene). Allelic variations or naturally-occurring mutational events do not give rise to a heterologous region of DNA as defined herein. [0196] Homology, as used herein, refers broadly to a degree of similarity between a nucleic acid sequence and a reference nucleic acid sequence or between a polypeptide sequence and a reference polypeptide sequence. Homology may be partial or complete. Complete homology indicates that the nucleic acid or amino acid sequences are identical. A partially homologous nucleic acid or amino acid sequence is one that is not identical to the reference nucleic acid or amino acid sequence. The degree of homology can be determined by sequence comparison. The term \"sequence identity\" may be used interchangeably with \"homology.\" [0197] Host cell, as used herein, refers broadly to a cell that contains an expression vector and supports the replication or expression of the expression vector. Host cells may be prokaryotic cells such as E. coli, or eukaryotic cells such as yeast, insect (e.g., SF9), amphibian, or mammalian cells such as CHO, HeLa, HEK-293 (e.g., cultured cells, explants, and cells in vivo.)

Isolated material may be, for example, exogenous nucleic acid included in a vector system, exogenous nucleic acid contained within a host cell, or any material which has been removed from its original environment and thus altered by the hand of man (e.g., \"isolated antibody\"). [0199] Improved, as used herein, refers broadly to any beneficial change resulting from a treatment. A beneficial change is any way in which a patient's condition is better than it would have been in the absence of the treatment. \"Improved\" includes prevention of an undesired condition, slowing the rate at which a condition worsens, delaying the development of an undesired condition, and restoration to an essentially normal condition. For example, improvement in psoriatic arthritis encompasses any decrease in pain, swelling, joint stiffness, or inflammation, and/or an increase in joint mobility. [0200] IL-6 antagonist, as used herein, refers broadly to any composition that prevents, inhibits, or lessens the effect(s) of IL-6 signaling. Generally, such antagonists may reduce the levels or activity of IL-6, IL-6 receptor alpha, gp 130, or a molecule involved in IL-6 signal transduction, or may reduce the levels or activity complexes between the foregoing (e.g., reducing the activity of an IL-6 / IL-6 34 WO 2015/054293PCT/US2014/059543 receptor complex). Antagonists include antisense nucleic acids, including DNA, RNA, or a nucleic acid analogue such as a peptide 243(2): 209-14; Hannon and Rossi (2004) Nature 431(7006):371-8; Paul, et al.

[0101] Prophylactically effective amount, as used herein, refers broadly to the amount of a compound that, when administered to a patient for prophylaxis of a disease or prevention of the reoccurrence of a disease, is sufficient to effect such prophylaxis for the disease or reoccurrence. The prophylactically effective amount may be an amount effective to prevent the incidence of signs and/or symptoms. The \"prophylactically effective amount\" may vary depending on the disease and its severity and the age, weight, medical history, predisposition to conditions, preexisting conditions, of the patient to be treated. 37 WO 2015/054293PCT/US2014/059543 [0102] Prophylaxis, as used herein, refers broadly to a course of therapy where signs and/or symptoms are not present in the patient, are in remission, or were previously present in a patient. Prophylaxis includes preventing disease occurring subsequent to treatment of a disease in a patient. Further, prevention includes treating patients who may potentially develop the disease, especially patients who are susceptible to the disease {e.g., members of a patent population, those with risk factors, or at risk for developing the disease). [0103] Recombinant as used herein, refers broadly with reference to a product, e.g., to a cell, or nucleic acid, protein, or vector, indicates that the cell, nucleic acid, protein or vector, has been modified by the introduction of a heterologous nucleic acid or protein or the alteration of a native nucleic acid or protein, or that the cell is derived from a cell so modified. Thus, for example, recombinant cells express genes that are not found within the native (non-recombinant) form of the cell or express native genes that are otherwise abnormally expressed, under expressed or not expressed at all. [0104] Selectable Marker, as used herein, refers broadly to a selectable marker is a gene or gene fragment that confers a growth phenotype (physical growth characteristic) on a cell receiving that gene as, for example through a transformation event. The selectable marker allows that cell to survive and grow in a selective growth medium under conditions in which cells that do not receive that selectable marker gene cannot grow. Selectable marker genes generally fall into several types, including positive selectable marker genes such as a gene that confers on a cell resistance to an antibiotic or other drug, temperature when two ts mutants are crossed or a ts mutant is transformed; negative selectable marker genes such as a biosynthetic gene that confers on a cell the ability to grow in a medium without a specific nutrient needed by all cells that do not have that biosynthetic gene, or a mutagenized biosynthetic gene that confers on a cell inability to grow by cells that do not have the wild type gene; and the like. Suitable markers include but are not limited to ZEOMYCIN\u00ae (zeocin), Specifically (or selectively) binds to an antibody or \"specifically (or selectively) immunoreactive with,\" or \"specifically interacts or binds,\" as used herein, refers broadly to a protein or peptide (or other epitope), refers, in some embodiments, to a binding reaction that is determinative of the presence of the protein in a heterogeneous population of proteins and other biologies. For example, under designated immunoassay conditions, the specified antibodies bind to a particular protein at least two times greater than the background (non-specific signal) and do not substantially bind in a significant amount to other proteins present in the sample. Typically a specific or selective reaction will be at least twice background signal or noise and more typically more than about 10 to 100 times background. 38 WO 2015/054293PCT/US2014/059543 [0106] Signs of disease, as used herein, refers broadly to any abnormality indicative of disease, discoverable on examination of the patient; an objective indication of disease, in contrast to a symptom, which is a subjective indication of disease.

Mammals of the present subject technology include, but are not limited to, canines, felines, bovines, caprines, equines, ovines, porcines, rodents (e.g., rats and mice), lagomorphs, primates, humans. Any mammalian subject in need of being treated according to the present subject technology is suitable. Human subjects of both genders and at any stage of development (i.e., neonate, infant, juvenile, adolescent, adult) can be treated according to the present subject technology. The present subject technology may also be carried out on animal subjects, particularly mammalian subjects such as mice, rats, dogs, cats, cattle, goats, sheep, and horses for veterinary purposes, and for drug screening and drug development purposes. \"Subjects\" is used interchangeably with \"patients.\" [0109] Mating competent yeast species, as used herein refers broadly encompass any diploid or tetraploid yeast which can be grown in culture. Such species of yeast may exist in a haploid, diploid, or tetraploid form. The cells of a given ploidy may, under appropriate conditions, proliferate for indefinite number of generations in that form. Diploid cells can also sporulate to form haploid cells. Sequential mating can result in tetraploid strains through further mating or fusion of diploid strains. In the present subject technology the diploid or polyploidal yeast cells are preferably produced by mating or spheroplast fusion. [0110] Haploid Yeast Cell, as used herein, refers broadly to a cell having a single copy of each gene of its normal genomic (chromosomal) complement. [0111] Polyploid Yeast Cell, as used herein, refers broadly to a cell having more than one copy of its normal genomic (chromosomal) complement. [0112] Diploid Yeast Cell, as used herein, refers broadly to a cell having two copies (alleles) of essentially every gene of its normal genomic complement, typically formed by the process of fusion (mating) of two haploid cells. [0113] Tetraploid Yeast Cell, as used herein, refers broadly to a cell having four copies (alleles) of essentially every gene of its normal genomic complement, typically formed by the process of fusion (mating) of two haploid cells. Tetraploids may carry two, three, four, or more different expression cassettes.

For example, [his]; [arg] to obtain a tetraploid prototroph. It will be understood by those of skill in the art that reference to the benefits and uses of diploid cells may also apply to tetraploid cells. [0114] Yeast Mating, as used herein, refers broadly to a process by which two haploid yeast cells naturally fuse to form one diploid yeast cell. [0115] Meiosis, as used herein, refers broadly to a process by which a diploid yeast cell undergoes reductive division to form four haploid spore products.

[0118] The techniques and procedures are generally performed according to conventional methods well known in the art and as described in various general and more specific references that are cited and discussed throughout the present specification. See, e.g., Sambrook, et al. (2001) Molec. Cloning: Lab. Manual [3r d Ed] Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. Standard techniques may be used for recombinant DNA, oligonucleotide synthesis, and tissue culture, and transformation (e.g., electroporation, lipofection). Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques may be performed according to manufacturer's specifications or as commonly accomplished in the art or as described herein. The nomenclatures utilized in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. Standard techniques may be 40 WO 2015/054293PCT/US2014/059543 used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients. ANTI-IL-6 ANTIBODIES FOR TREATING PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS [0119] The present technology also relates to compositions, methods, and uses of anti-IL-6 antibodies and/or antigen-binding fragments thereof according to the subject technology for treating, preventing, or alleviating the onset of psoriatic arthritis. [0120] The subject therapy may comprise administering the antibody prior or concurrent to development of the symptoms of psoriatic arthritis. Particularly this may be used in patients who have shown signs of inadequate response to Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs including (e.g., Aspirin (acetylsalicylic subject technology provides for method of treating psoriatic arthritis comprising administration of a composition comprising an effective amount of an antigen-binding fragment thereof, to a subject in need thereof, wherein the antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, specifically binds to IL-6. [0122] The subject technology also provides for method of preventing psoriatic arthritis comprising administration of a composition comprising an effective amount of an antigen-binding fragment thereof, to a subject in need thereof, wherein the antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, specifically binds to IL-6. [0123] In either the methods of treatment or prevention, the antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, is aglycosylated. Further, the antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, may contain an Fe region that has been modified to alter effector function, half-life, proteolysis, and/or glycosylation. 41 WO 2015/054293PCT/US2014/059543 Additionally, the antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, is a human, humanized, single chain, or chimeric antibody. [0124] Further, the method of treating or preventing psoriatic arthritis may comprise administering a composition comprises at least about 25, 80, 100, 160, 200, or 320 mg of an antigen-binding fragment thereof. The method of treating or preventing psoriatic arthritis may comprise administering a composition comprises at least about 25, 80, 100, 160, 200, or 320 mg of antigen-binding fragment thereof, subcutaneously every 4 weeks for at least 8, 16, 20, or 24 weeks. [0125] In an embodiment of the subject technology, IL-6 antagonists such as Abl described herein are useful for ameliorating or reducing the symptoms of, or treating, or preventing, psoriatic arthritis. The IL-6 antagonists described herein (e.g., Abl-Ab36) is administered in a therapeutically effective amount to patients in need of treatment of psoriatic arthritis in the form of a pharmaceutical composition formulated for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. [0126] The dosing regimen is based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from previous studies. For example, in the advanced cancer clinical trial, single IV doses of 80, 160, and 320 mg ALD518 decreased CRP levels to normal or near normal for 12 weeks. In the rheumatoid arthritis clinical trial, 2 IV doses of 80, 160, and 320 mg ALD518 given 8 weeks apart decreased CRP levels to normal or nearly normal for 16 weeks. However, in the NSCLC clinical trial, CRP levels were decreased 2 weeks after the first of 3 IV doses of 80, 160, and 320 mg of ALD518, 8 weeks apart, but increased prior to the second dose. In addition, the elimination half-life, which is based on free ALD518, was 28 days in the normal subject, advanced cancer, but was reduced to 21 days in the NSCLC clinical trial. ALD518* is an asialated, humanized anti-IL-6 monoclonal with a half-life of ~30 days containing the humanized variable heavy and light sequences set forth in SEQ ID NO: 19 and 20. Pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling of data from the NSCLC clinical trial indicates that doses of ALD518 80 mg administered once every 3 weeks would not result in trough ALD518 concentrations high enough to fully suppress CRP. Since CRP levels in the published data in head and neck cancer studies can be as high as those seen in subjects with NSCLC, the doses may be 160 mg and 320 mg of humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds IL-6 administered every 4 weeks. See, e.g., Gallo, et al. (1992) Br J Cancer 65:479-80; Duffy, et al. (2008) Cancer 113:750-7. Examplary ALD518 plasma concentration effective to inhibit CRP may be at least about 15 pg/mL. [0127] ALD518 is an exemplary humanized anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody. ALD518 may be supplied as a pH 6.0 frozen injection in single-use vials (e.g., 80, 160, or 320 mg) for intravenous 42 WO 2015/054293PCT/US2014/059543 administration. In the 80 mg dose, exemplary non-active excipients include but are not limited to 25 mM histidine and 250 mM sorbitol. In the 160 mg formulation, exemplary non-active excipients include but are not limited to 25 mM histidine, 250 mM sorbitol, and 0.015% polysorbate 80. Compositions comprising humanized monoclonal antibodies that selectively bind IL-6 (e.g., ALD518) may be sterile, preservative-free frozen liquid injection in depyrogenated sterile vials, which are stoppered and sealed containing approximately 80 mg (e.g., 7.6 mL in a 10 mLvial) or approximately 160 mg (e.g., 4 mL in a 5 mL vial). For example, one dose of ALD518 (e.g., 160 mg or 320 mg) in 250 mL 0.9% saline may be administered IV over a period of at least about one hour (\u00b1 15 minutes) on the morning of RT Day I and RT Treatment Week 4. [0128] In one embodiment of the subject technology, IL-6 antagonists described herein (e.g., Abl) are useful for ameliorating or reducing the symptoms of, or treating, or preventing psoriatic arthritis. [0129] In another embodiment of the subject technology, IL-6 antagonists described herein are administered to a patient in combination with another active agent. For example, an IL-6 antagonist such as Abl may be co-administered with at least one chemotherapy agents, such as ANTI-IL-6 ANTIBODIES AND BINDING FRAGMENTS THEREOF [0130] The subject technology includes antibodies having binding specificity to IL-6 and possessing a variable light chain sequence comprising the sequence set forth in the polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 709 and humanized versions and variants thereof including those set forth in FIGS. I and 8-11, and those identified in Table I. [0131] Antibodies consist of two identical light polypeptide chains of molecular weight approximately 23,000 daltons (the \"light chain\"), and two identical heavy chains of molecular weight 53,000-70,000 (the \"heavy chain\"). The four chains are joined by disulfide bonds in a \"Y\" configuration wherein the light chains bracket the heavy chains starting at the mouth of the \"Y\" configuration. The \"branch\" portion of the \"Y\" configuration is designated the Fab region; the stem portion of the \"Y\" configuration is designated the Fe region. The amino acid sequence orientation runs from the N-terminal end at the top of the \"Y\" configuration to the C-terminal end at the bottom of each chain. The N-terminal end possesses the variable region having specificity for the antigen that elicited it, and is approximately 100 amino acids in length, there being slight variations between light and heavy chain and from antibody to antibody. 43 WO 2015/054293PCT/US2014/059543 [0132] The variable region is linked in each chain to a constant region that extends the remaining length of the chain and that within a particular class of antibody does not vary with the specificity of the antibody (i.e., the antigen eliciting it). There are five known major classes of constant regions that determine the class of the immunoglobulin molecule (IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE corresponding to , , , , and (gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon) heavy chain constant regions). The constant region or class determines subsequent effector function of the antibody, including activation of complement (Kabat, E. A. (1976) Structural Concepts in Immunology and Immunochemistry, 2nd Ed., pp. 413-M36, Holt, Rinehart, Winston), and other cellular responses (Andrews, et al. (1980) Clinical Immunobiology pp 1-18, W. B. Sanders; Kohl, et al. (1983) Immunology 48: 187); while the variable region determines the antigen with which it will react. Light chains are classified as either (kappa) or (lambda). Each heavy chain class can be paired with either kappa or lambda light chain. The light and heavy chains are covalently bonded to each other, and the \"tail\" portions of the two heavy chains are bonded to each other by covalent disulfide linkages when the immunoglobulins are generated either by hybridomas or by B cells. [0133] For example, antibodies or antigen binding fragments or variants thereof may be produced by genetic engineering. In this technique, as with other methods, antibody-producing cells are sensitized to the desired antigen or immunogen. The messenger RNA isolated from antibody producing cells is used as a template to make cDNA using PCR amplification. A library of vectors, each containing one heavy chain gene and one light chain gene retaining the initial antigen specificity, is produced by insertion of appropriate sections of the amplified immunoglobulin cDNA into the expression vectors. A combinatorial library is constructed by combining the heavy chain gene library with the light chain gene library. This results in a library of clones which co-express a heavy and light chain (resembling the Fab fragment or antigen binding fragment of an antibody molecule). The vectors that carry these genes are co-transfected into a host cell. When antibody gene synthesis is induced in the transfected host, the heavy and light chain proteins self-assemble to produce active antibodies that can be detected by screening with the antigen or immunogen. [0134] Antibody coding sequences of interest include those encoded by native sequences, as well as nucleic acids that, by virtue of the degeneracy of the genetic code, are not identical in sequence to the disclosed nucleic acids, and variants thereof. Variant polypeptides can include amino acid (aa) substitutions, additions or deletions. The amino acid substitutions can be conservative amino acid substitutions or substitutions to eliminate non-essential amino acids, such as to alter a glycosylation site, or to minimize misfolding by substitution or deletion of at least one cysteine residues that are not necessary for function. Variants can be designed so as to retain or have enhanced biological activity of a particular region of the protein (e.g., a functional domain, catalytic amino acid residues). Variants also include fragments of the polypeptides disclosed herein, particularly biologically active fragments and/or fragments corresponding to functional domains. Techniques for in vitro mutagenesis 44 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 of cloned genes are known. Also included in the subject technology are polypeptides that have been modified using ordinary molecular biological techniques so as to improve their resistance to proteolytic degradation or to optimize solubility properties or to render them more suitable as a therapeutic agent. [0135] Chimeric antibodies may be made by recombinant means by combining the variable light and heavy chain regions (VL and VH ), obtained from antibody producing cells of one species with the constant light and heavy chain regions from another. Typically chimeric antibodies utilize rodent or rabbit variable regions and human constant regions, in order to produce an antibody with predominantly human domains. The production of such chimeric antibodies is well known in the art, and may be achieved by standard means (as described, e.g., in U.S. Patent No. 5,624,659, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). It is further contemplated that the human constant regions of chimeric antibodies of the subject technology may be regions. [0136] Humanized antibodies are engineered to contain even more human-like immunoglobulin domains, and incorporate only the complementarity-determining regions of the animal-derived antibody. This is accomplished by carefully examining the sequence of the hyper-variable loops of the variable regions of the monoclonal antibody, and fitting them to the structure of the human antibody chains. Although facially complex, the process is straightforward in practice. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,187,287. In a preferred embodiment, humanization may be effected as disclosed in detail infra. This scheme grafts CDRs onto human FRs highly homologous to the parent antibody that is being humanized. [0137] Immunoglobulins and fragments thereof may be modified post-translationally, e.g. to add effector moieties such as chemical materials, radioactive materials, chemiluminescent moieties and the like, or specific binding moieties, such as streptavidin, avidin, or biotin, and the like may be utilized in the methods and compositions of the present subject technology.

The chimeric antibodies may include an Fe IgG 19 constant regions and in particular a variable heavy and light chain constant region as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 588 and SEQ ID NO: 586. [0176] In one embodiment of the subject technology, the antibodies or Vh or Vl polypeptides originate or are selected from at least one rabbit B cell populations prior to initiation of the humanization process referenced herein. [0177] In another embodiment of the subject technology, the anti-IL-6 antibodies and fragments and variants thereof have binding specificity for primate homologs of the human IL-6 protein. Non\u00ad limiting examples of primate homologs of the human IL-6 protein are IL-6 obtained from Macaca fascicularis (cynomolgus monkey) and the Rhesus monkey. In another embodiment of the subject technology, the anti-IL-6 antibodies and fragments and variants thereof inhibits the association of IL- 6 with IL-6R, and/or the production of IL-6/IL-6R/gpl30 complexes and/or the production of IL-6/IL- 6R/gpl30 multimers and/or antagonizes the biological effects of at least one of the foregoing. Polyclonal Antibody 61 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 [0178] Polyclonal antibodies are heterogeneous populations of antibody molecules derived from the sera of animals immunized with an antigen. Polyclonal antibodies which selectively bind the IL-6 may be made by methods well-known in the art. See, e.g., Howard & Kaser (2007) Making and Lfsing Antibodies: A Practical Handbook CRC Press. Monoclonal Antibody [0179] A monoclonal antibody contains a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies specific to antigens, which population contains substantially similar epitope binding sites. Monoclonal antibodies may be obtained by methods known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g. Kohler and Milstein (1975) Nature 256: 495^197; U.S. Patent No. 4,376,110; Ausubel, et al. [Eds.] (2011) CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, Greene Publishing Assoc, and Wiley Interscience, NY.; and Harlow & Lane (1998) USING ANTIBODIES: A LABORATORY MANUAL Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; Colligan, et al. (2005) [Eds.] Current Protocols in Immunology Greene Publishing Assoc, and Wiley Interscience, NY. Such antibodies may be of any immunoglobulin class including IgG, IgM, IgE, IgA, GILD and any subclass thereof. A hybridoma producing an antibody of the present subject technology may be cultivated in vitro, in situ, or in vivo. Chimeric Antibody [0180] Chimeric antibodies are molecules different portions of which are derived from different animal species, such as those having variable region derived from a murine antibody and a human immunoglobulin constant region, which are primarily used to reduce immunogenicity in application and to increase yields in production, for example, where murine monoclonal antibodies have higher yields from hybridomas but higher immunogenicity in humans, such that human murine chimeric monoclonal antibodies are used. Chimeric antibodies and methods for their production are known in the art. See Cabilly, et al. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. Acad. 6851-6855, Boulianne, et al. 312: 643-646; Sahagan, et al. (1987) Proc. Natl. 3439-3443; Natl. Acad. Sci. 84: 214-218; Better, et al. (1988) Science 240: 1041-1043; and Harlow & Lane (1998) USING ANTIBODIES: A LABORATORY MANUAL Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; and U.S. Patent No. 5,624,659. Humanized Antibody [0181] Humanized antibodies are engineered to contain even more human-like immunoglobulin domains, and incorporate only the complementarity-determining regions of the animal-derived antibody. This may be accomplished by examining the sequence of the hyper-variable loops of the variable regions of the monoclonal antibody, and fitting them to the structure of the human antibody chains. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,187,287. Likewise, other methods of producing humanized 62 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 antibodies are now well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Patent 522-525; Reichmann, et al. (1988) Nature 332: 323-327; Verhoeyen, et al. (1988) Science 239: 1534-36; and Zhiqiang An (2009) [Ed.] Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies: From Bench to Clinic John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Antibody Fragments (antigen-binding fragments) [0182] In addition to entire immunoglobulins (or their recombinant counterparts), immunoglobulin fragments comprising the epitope binding site (e.g., Fab', F(ab')2 , or other fragments) may be synthesized. \"Fragment,\" or minimal immunoglobulins may be designed utilizing recombinant immunoglobulin techniques. For instance \"Fv\" immunoglobulins for use in the present subject technology may be produced by synthesizing a fused variable light chain region and a variable heavy chain region. Combinations of antibodies are also of interest, e.g. diabodies, which comprise two distinct Fv specificities. Antigen-binding fragments of immunoglobulins include but are not SMIPs (small molecule An antibody is an antibody which recognizes unique determinants generally associated with the antigen-binding site of an antibody. An Id antibody may be prepared by immunizing an animal of Ihe same species and genetic type (e.g., mouse strain) as the source of the antibody with the antibody to which an anti-id is being prepared. The immunized animal will recognize and respond to the idiotypic determinants of the immunizing antibody by producing an antibody to these idiotypic determinants (the anti-ld antibody). See e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,699,880. The anti-id antibody may also be used as an \"immunogen\" to induce an immune response in yet another animal, producing a so-called anti-anti-Id antibody. The anti-anti-Id may be epitopically identical to the original antibody which induced the anti-id. Thus, by using antibodies to the idiotypic determinants of an antibody it is possible to identify other clones expressing antibodies of identical specificity. Engineered And Modified Antibodies [0184] An antibody of the subject technology further may be prepared using an antibody having at least one of the VH and/or VL sequences derived from an antibody starting material to engineer a modified antibody, which modified antibody may have altered properties from the starting antibody. An antibody may be engineered by modifying at least one residues within one or both variable regions (i.e., VH and/or VL), for example within at least one CDR regions and/or within at least one framework regions. Additionally or alternatively, an antibody may be engineered by modifying residues within the constant region(s), for example to alter the effector function(s) of the antibody. [0185] One type of variable region engineering that may be performed is CDR grafting. Antibodies interact with target antigens predominantly through amino acid residues that are located in 63 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 the six heavy and light chain complementarity determining regions (CDRs). For this reason, the amino acid sequences within CDRs are more diverse between individual antibodies than sequences outside of CDRs. Because CDR sequences are responsible for most antibody-antigen interactions, it is possible to express recombinant antibodies that mimic the properties of specific naturally occurring antibodies by constructing expression vectors that include CDR sequences from the specific naturally occurring antibody grafted onto framework sequences from a different antibody with different properties. See, e.g., Riechmann, et al. (1998) Nature 332: 323-327; Jones, et al. (1986) Nature 321: 11989) [0186] Suitable framework sequences may be obtained from public DNA databases or published references that include germline antibody gene sequences. For example, germline DNA sequences for human heavy and light chain variable region genes may be found in the \"VBase\" human germline sequence database (available on the Internet), as well as in Kabat, E. A., et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242; Tomlinson, et al. (1992) \"The Repertoire of Human Germline VH Sequences Reveals about Fifty Groups of VH Segments with Different Hypervariable Loops\" J. Mol. Biol. 227: 776-798; Eur. J Immunol. 24: 827-836. [0187] Another type of variable region modification is to mutate amino acid residues within the VH and/or VL CDR I, CDR2 and/or CDR3 regions to thereby improve at least one binding properties (e.g., affinity) of the antibody of interest. Site-directed mutagenesis or PCR-mediated mutagenesis may be performed to introduce the mutation(s) and the effect on antibody binding, or other functional property of interest, may be evaluated in appropriate in vitro or in vivo assays. Preferably conservative modifications (as discussed herein) may be introduced. The mutations may be amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions, but are preferably substitutions. Moreover, typically no more than one, two, three, four or five residues within a CDR region are altered. [0188] Engineered antibodies of the subject technology include those in which modifications have been made to framework residues within VH and/or VL, e.g. to improve the properties of the antibody. Typically such framework modifications are made to decrease the immunogenicity of the antibody. For example, one approach is to \"backmutate\" at least one framework residues to the corresponding germline sequence. More specifically, an antibody that has undergone somatic mutation may contain framework residues that differ from the germline sequence from which the antibody is derived. Such residues may be identified by comparing the antibody framework sequences to the germline sequences from which the antibody is derived. [0189] In addition or alternative to modifications made within the framework or CDR regions, antibodies of the subject technology may be engineered to include modifications within the Fe region, typically to alter at least one functional properties of the antibody, such as serum half-life, 64 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 complement fixation, Fe receptor binding, and/or antigen-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Furthermore, an antibody of the subject technology may be chemically modified {e.g., at least one chemical moieties may be attached to the antibody) or be modified to alter its glycosylation, again to alter at least one functional properties of the antibody. Such embodiments are described further below. The numbering of residues in the Fe region is that of the EU index of Kabat. [0190] The hinge region of CHl may be modified such that the number of cysteine residues in the hinge region is altered, e.g., increased or decreased. See U.S. Patent No. 5,677,425. The number of cysteine residues in the hinge region of CHl may be altered to, for example, facilitate assembly of the light and heavy chains or to increase or decrease the stability of the antibody. The Fe hinge region of an antibody may be mutated to decrease the biological half-life of the antibody. More specifically, at least one amino acid mutations may be introduced into the CH2-CH3 domain interface region of the Fc-hinge fragment such that the antibody has impaired Staphylococcyl protein A (SpA) binding relative to native Fc-hinge domain SpA binding. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,165,745. [0191] The antibody may be modified to increase its biological half-life. Various approaches are possible. For example, at least one of the following mutations may be introduced: T252L, T254S, T256F. See U.S. Patent No. 6,277,375. Alternatively, to increase the biological half-life, the antibody may be altered within the CHl or CL region to contain a salvage receptor binding epitope taken from two loops of a CH2 domain of an Fe region of an IgG. See U.S. Patent Nos. 5,869,046 and 6,121,022. [0192] The Fe region may be altered by replacing at least one amino acid residue with a different amino acid residue to alter the effector function(s) of the antibody. For example, at least one amino acid selected from amino acid residues 234, 235, 236, 237, 297, 318, 320 and 322 may be replaced with a different amino acid residue such that the antibody has an altered affinity for an effector ligand but retains the antigen-binding ability of the parent antibody. The effector ligand to which affinity may be altered may be, for example, an Fe receptor or the Cl component of complement. See U.S. Patent Nos. 5,624,821 and 5,648,260. [0193] The Fe region may be modified to increase the affinity of the antibody for an Fcy receptor by modifying at least one amino acids at the following positions: 238, 239, 248, 249, 252, 254, 255, 256, 258, 265, 267, 268, 269, 270, 272, 276, 278, 280, 283, 285, 286, 289, 290, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 298, 301, 303, 305, 307, 309, 312, 315, 320, 322, 324, 326, 327, 329, 330, 331, 333, 334, 335, 337, 338, 340, 360, 373, 376, 378, 382, 388, 389, 398, 414, 416, 419, 430, 434, 435, 437, 438 or 439. See WO 00/42072. Moreover, the binding sites on human IgGl for FcyRI, FcyRII, FcyRIII and FcRn have been mapped and variants with improved binding. See Shields, et al. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276: 6591-6604. Specific mutations at positions 256, 290, 298, 333, 334 and 339 are shown to improve binding to FcyRIII. Additionally, the following combination mutants are shown to improve The glycosylation of an antibody may be modified. For example, an aglycosylated antibody may be made (i.e., the antibody lacks glycosylation). Glycosylation may be altered to, for example, increase the affinity of the antibody for antigen. Such carbohydrate modifications may be accomplished by, for example, altering at least one sites of glycosylation within the antibody sequence. For example, at least one amino acid substitutions may be made that result in elimination of at least one variable region framework glycosylation sites to thereby eliminate glycosylation at that site. Such aglyclosylation may increase the affinity of the antibody for antigen. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,714,350 and 6,350,861. [0195] Additionally or alternatively, an antibody may be made that has an altered type of glycosylation, such as a hypofucosylated antibody having reduced amounts of fucosyl residues or an antibody having increased bisecting GlcNac structures. Such carbohydrate modifications may be accomplished by, for example, expressing the antibody in a host cell with altered glycosylation machinery. Cells with altered glycosylation machinery have been described in the art and may be used as host cells in which to express recombinant antibodies of the subject technology to thereby produce an antibody with altered glycosylation. See U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0110704 and 277: 26733-26740; WO 99/54342; Umana, et al. Biochem. 14: 5516-23. [0196] An antibody may be pegylated to, for example, increase the biological (e.g., serum) half-life of the antibody. To pegylate an antibody, the antibody, or fragment thereof, typically is reacted with polyethylene glycol (PEG), such as a reactive ester or aldehyde derivative of PEG, under conditions in which at least one PEG groups become attached to the antibody or antibody fragment. Preferably, the pegylation is carried out via an acylation reaction or an alkylation reaction with a reactive PEG molecule (or an analogous reactive water-soluble polymer). [0197] The subject technology also provides variants and equivalents that are substantially homologous to the antibodies, antibody fragments, diabodies, SMIPs, camelbodies, nanobodies, IgNAR, polypeptides, variable regions and CDRs set forth herein. These may contain, e.g., conservative substitution mutations, (i.e., the substitution of at least one amino acids by similar amino acids). For example, conservative substitution refers to the substitution of an amino acid with another within the same general class, e.g., one acidic amino acid with another acidic amino acid, one basic amino acid with another basic amino acid, or one neutral amino acid by another neutral amino acid. In another embodiment, the subject technology further contemplates the above-recited polypeptide homologs of the antibody fragments, variable regions and CDRs set forth herein further having anti- IL-6 activity. Non-limiting examples of anti-IL-6 activity are set forth herein, for example, under the \"Anti-IL-6 Activity,\" infra. 66 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 [0198] Anti-IL-6 antibodies have also been disclosed in the following published and unpublished patent applications, which are co-owned by the assignee of the present application: WO 2008/144763; U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2009/0028784, 2009/0297513, and 2009/0297436. Other anti-IL-6 antibodies have been disclosed in the following U.S. Patents and Published Patent Application anti-IL-6 antibodies sequence described herein, further characterization or optimization may be achieved by systematically either adding or removing amino acid residues to generate longer or shorter peptides, and testing those and sequences generated by walking a window of the longer or shorter size up or down the antigen from that point. Coupling this approach to generating new candidate targets with testing for effectiveness of antigenic molecules based on those sequences in an immunogenicity assay, as known in the art or as described herein, may lead to further manipulation of the antigen. Further still, such optimized sequences may be adjusted by, e.g., the addition, deletions, or other mutations as known in the art and/or discussed herein to further optimize the anti-IL-6 antibodies (e.g., increasing serum stability or circulating half-life, increasing thermal stability, enhancing delivery, enhance immunogenicity, increasing solubility, targeting to a particular in vivo location or cell type). [0200 ] In another embodiment, the subject technology contemplates polypeptide sequences having at least about 90% sequence homology to any at least one of the polypeptide sequences of antibody fragments, variable regions and CDRs set forth herein. More preferably, the subject technology contemplates polypeptide sequences having at least about 95% sequence homology, even more preferably at least about 98% sequence homology, and still more preferably at least about 99% sequence homology to any at least one of the polypeptide sequences of antibody fragments, variable regions and CDRs set forth herein. Methods for determining homology between nucleic acid and amino acid sequences are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. [0201] The anti-IL-6 antibodies polypeptides described herein may comprise conservative substitution mutations, (i.e., the substitution of at least one amino acids by similar amino acids). For example, conservative substitution refers to the substitution of an amino acid with another within the same general class, e.g., one acidic amino acid with another acidic amino acid, one basic amino acid with another basic amino acid, or one neutral amino acid by another neutral amino acid. [0202] Anti-IL-6 antibodies polypeptide sequences may have at least about 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 98.5, 99, 99.5, 99.8, 99.9, or 100% sequence homology to any at least one of the polypeptide sequences set forth herein. More preferably, the subject technology contemplates polypeptide sequences having at least about 95% sequence homology, even more preferably at least about 98% sequence homology, and still more 67 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 preferably at least about 99% sequence homology to any at least one of the polypeptide sequences of Anti-IL-6 antibodies polypeptide sequences set forth herein. Methods for determining homology between amino acid sequences, as well as nucleic acid sequences, are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. See, e.g., Nedelkov & Nelson (2006) New and Emerging Proteomic Techniques Humana Press. Thus, an anti-IL-6 antibodies polypeptide may have at least about 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 98.5, 99, 99.5, 99.8, 99.9, or 100% sequence homology with a polypeptide sequence. [0203] The term homology, or identity, is understood as meaning the number of agreeing amino acids (identity) with other proteins, expressed in percent. The identity is preferably determined by comparing a given sequence with other proteins with the aid of computer programs. If sequences which are compared with each other are different in length, the identity is to be determined in such a way that the number of amino acids which the short sequence shares with the longer sequence determines the percentage identity. The identity can be determined routinely by means of known computer programs which are publicly available such as, for example, ClustalW. Thompson, et al. (1994) Nucleic Acids Research 22: 4673\u2014 4680. ClustalW is publicly available from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory and may be downloaded from various internet pages, inter alia the IGBMC (Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire) and the EBI and all mirrored EBI internet pages (European Bioinformatics Institute). If the ClustalW computer program Version I.8 is used to determine the identity between, for example, the reference protein of the present application and other proteins, the following parameters are to Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) toolbox available on-line and Smith (2002) Protein Sequencing Protocols [2n d Ed.] Humana Press. [0204] One possibility of finding similar sequences is to carry out sequence database researches. Here, at least one sequences may be entered as what is known as a query. This query sequence is then compared with sequences present in the selected databases using statistical computer programs. Such database queries (blast searches) are known to the skilled worker and may be carried out at different suppliers. If, for example, such a database query is carried out at the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information), the standard settings for the respective comparison query should be used. For protein sequence comparisons (blastp), these settings are: Limit entrez = not activated; Filter = low complexity activated; Expect value = 10; word size = 3; Matrix = BLOSUM62; Gap costs: Existence = II, Extension = I. The result of such a query is, among other parameters, the degree of identity between the query sequence and the similar sequences found in the databases. Methods and materials for making fragments of Anti-IL-6 antibodies polypeptides are well known in the art. See, e.g., Maniatis, et al. (2001) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual [3rd Ed.] Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. 68 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 [0205] Variant anti-IL-6 antibodies polypeptides may retain their antigenic specificity to bind IL-6. Fully specific variants may contain only conservative variations or variations in non-critical residues or in non-critical regions. Variants may also contain substitution of similar amino acids that result in no change or an insignificant change in their specificity. Alternatively, such substitutions may positively or negatively affect specificity to some degree. Non-specific variants typically contain at least one non-conservative amino acid substitutions, deletions, insertions, inversions, or truncation or a substitution, insertion, inversion, or deletion in a critical residue or critical region of an epitope. Molecular biology and biochemistry techniques for modifying anti-IL-6 antibodies polypeptides while preserving specificity are well known in the art. See, e.g., Ho, et al. (1989) Gene 77(1): 51-59; Landt, et al. (1990) FEBS Letters 188(2): 215-218 [0206] Amino acids that are essential for function may be identified by methods known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis. Cunningham, et al. (1989) Sci. 244: 1081-85. The latter procedure introduces single alanine mutations at every residue in the molecule. The resulting mutant molecules are then tested for biological activity such as epitope binding. Sites that are critical for ligand-receptor binding may also be determined by structural analysis such as crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, or photoaffinity labeling. Smith, et al. (1992) J. Mol. Biol. 224: de Vos, et al. (1992) [0207] For example, one class of substitutions is conserved amino acid substitutions. Such substitutions are those that substitute a given amino acid in an anti-IL-6 antibody polypeptide with another amino acid of like characteristics. Typically seen as conservative substitutions are the replacements, one for another, among the aliphatic amino acids Ala, Val, Leu, and He; interchange of the hydroxyl residues Ser and Thr, exchange of the acidic residues Asp and Glu, substitution between the amide residues Asn and Gin, exchange of the basic residues Lys and Arg, replacements among the aromatic residues Phe, Tyr. Guidance concerning which amino acid changes are likely to be phenotypically silent is found in, for example, Bowie, et al. (1990) Sci. 247: 1306-10. Hence, one of ordinary skill in the art appreciates that the inventors possess peptide variants without delineation of all the specific variants. As to amino acid sequences, one of skill will recognize that individual substitutions, deletions or additions to a nucleic acid, peptide, polypeptide, or protein sequence which alters, adds or deletes a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids in the encoded sequence is a \"conservatively modified variant\" where the alteration results in the substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid. Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. Such conservatively modified variants are in addition to and do not exclude polymorphic variants, interspecies homologs, and alleles of the 69 PCT/US2014/059543 subject technology. See, e.g., Creighton (1992) Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties [2n d Ed.] W.H. Freeman. [0208] Moreover, polypeptides often contain amino acids other than the twenty \"naturally occurring\" amino acids. Further, many amino acids, including the terminal amino acids, may be modified by natural processes, such as processing and other post-translational modifications, or by chemical modification techniques well known in the art. Known modifications include, but are not limited to, acetylation, acylation, ADP-ribosylation, amidation, attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative, covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative, covalent attachment of phosphotidylinositol, cross- linking, cyclization, disulfide amino to proteins such as arginylation, and ubiquitination. See Creighton (1992) Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties [2n d Ed.] and Lundblad (1995) Techniques in Protein Modification [1s t Ed.] Many detailed reviews are available on this subject. See, e.g., Wold (1983) Posttranslational Covalent Modification of Proteins Meth. Enzymol. Sci. 663: 48-62. [0209] In another embodiment, the subject technology further contemplates the generation and use of anti-idiotypic antibodies that bind any of the foregoing sequences. In an exemplary embodiment, such an anti-idiotypic antibody could be administered to a subject who has received an anti-IL-6 antibody to modulate, reduce, or neutralize, the effect of the anti-IL-6 antibody. A further exemplary use of such anti-idiotypic antibodies is for detection of the anti-IL-6 antibodies of the present subject technology, for example to monitor the levels of the anti-IL-6 antibodies present in a subject's blood or other bodily fluids. [0210] The present subject technology also contemplates anti-IL-6 antibodies comprising any of the polypeptide or polynucleotide sequences described herein substituted for any of the other polynucleotide sequences described herein. For example, without limitation thereto, the present subject technology contemplates antibodies comprising the combination of any of the variable light chain and variable heavy chain sequences described herein, and further contemplates antibodies resulting from substitution of any of the CDR sequences described herein for any of the other CDR sequences described herein. As noted preferred anti-IL-6 antibodies or fragments or variants thereof may contain a variable heavy and/or light sequence as shown in FIG. 2-5, such as SEQ ID NO: 651, 657, 709 or variants thereof wherein at least one CDR or FR residues are modified without adversely affecting antibody binding to IL-6 or other desired functional activity. Fusion Proteins 70 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 [0211] Fusions comprising the anti-IL-6 antibodies polypeptides are also within the scope of the present subject technology. For example, the fusion protein may be linked to a GST fusion protein in which the anti-IL-6 antibodies polypeptide sequences are fused to the C-terminus of the GST sequences. Such fusion proteins may facilitate the purification of the recombinant Anti-IL-6 antibodies polypeptides. Alternatively, anti-IL-6 antibodies polypeptides may be fused with a protein that binds B-cell follicles, thus initiating both a humoral immune response and activation of T cells. Berney, et al. (1999) J. Exp. Med. 190: 851-60. Alternatively, for example, the Anti-IL-6 antibodies polypeptides may be genetically coupled with and anti-dendritic cell antibody to deliver the antigen to the immune system and stimulate a cellular immune response. He, et al. (2004) Clin. Cancer Res. 10: 1920-27. A chimeric or fusion protein of the subject technology may be produced by standard recombinant DNA techniques. For example, DNA fragments coding for the different polypeptide sequences are ligated together in-frame in accordance with conventional techniques, e.g., by employing blunt-ended or stagger-ended termini for ligation, restriction enzyme digestion to provide for appropriate termini, filling-in of cohesive ends as appropriate, alkaline phosphatase treatment to avoid undesirable joining, and enzymatic ligation. The fusion gene may be synthesized by conventional techniques including automated DNA synthesizers. [0212] Fusion proteins may include C-terminal or N-terminal translocation sequences. Further, fusion proteins can comprise additional elements, e.g., for protein detection, purification, or other applications. Detection and purification facilitating domains including but not limited to metal chelating peptides such as polyhistidine tracts, histidine-tryptophan modules, or other domains that allow purification on immobilized metals; maltose binding protein; protein A domains that allow purification on immobilized immunoglobulin; or the domain utilized in the FLAG extension/affinity purification system (Immunex Corp, Seattle WA.) [0213] A fusion protein may be prepared from a protein of the subject technology by fusion with a portion of an immunoglobulin comprising a constant region of an immunoglobulin. More preferably, the portion of the immunoglobulin comprises a heavy chain constant region which is optionally and more preferably a human heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region is most preferably an IgG heavy chain constant region, and optionally and most preferably is an Fe chain, most preferably an IgG Fe fragment that comprises CH2 and CH3 domains. Although any IgG subtype may optionally be used, the IgGl subtype is preferred. The Fe chain may optionally be a known or \"wild type\" Fe chain, or alternatively may be mutated. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0034852. The term \"Fe chain\" also optionally comprises any type of Fe fragment. Several of the specific amino acid residues that are involved in antibody constant region- mediated activity in the IgG subclass have been identified. Inclusion, substitution or exclusion of these specific amino acids therefore allows for inclusion or exclusion of specific immunoglobulin constant region-mediated activity. Furthermore, specific changes may result in aglycosylation for 71 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 example and/or other desired changes to the Fe chain. At least some changes may optionally be made to block a function of Fe which is considered to be undesirable, such as an undesirable immune system effect. See McCafferty, et al. (2002) Antibody Engineering: A Practical Approach (Eds.) Oxford University Press. [0214] The inclusion of a cleavable linker sequences Eng. 10: 615-19); enterokinase (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA.), between the translocation domain (for efficient plasma membrane expression) and the rest of the newly translated polypeptide may be useful to facilitate purification. For example, one construct can include a polypeptide encoding a nucleic acid sequence linked to six histidine residues followed by a thioredoxin, an enterokinase cleavage site (see, e.g., Williams (1995) 1787-97), and an C-terminal translocation domain. The histidine residues facilitate detection and purification while the enterokinase cleavage site provides a means for purifying the desired protein(s) from the remainder of the fusion protein. Technology pertaining to vectors encoding fusion proteins and application of fusion proteins are well described in the scientific and patent literature. See, e.g., Kroll (1993) DNA Cell. Biol. 12: 441-53. Conjugates [0215] The anti-IL-6 antibodies, antibodies that bind the Anti-IL-6 antibodies and fragments thereof, may be conjugated to other moieties. Such conjugates are often used in the preparation of vaccines. The anti-IL-6 antibodies polypeptide may be conjugated to a carbohydrate (e.g., mannose, fucose, glucose, GlcNAs, maltose), which is recognized by the mannose receptor present on dendritic cells and macrophages. The ensuing binding, aggregation, and receptor-mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis functions provide enhanced innate and adaptive immunity. See Mahnke, et al. (2000) J. Cell Biol. 151: 673-84; Dong, et al. (1999) J. Immunol. 163: 5427-34. Othermoieties suitable for conjugation to elicit an immune response includes but not limited Encoding Anti-IL-6 Antibody Polypeptides [0216] The subject technology is further directed to polynucleotides encoding polypeptides of the antibodies having binding specificity to IL-6.

These nucleic acid sequences encoding variable heavy and light chain sequences may be expressed alone or in combination and these sequences preferably are fused to suitable variable constant sequences, e.g., those in SEQ ID NO: 589 and NO: 587. [0221] Exemplary nucleotide sequences encoding anti-IL-6 antibodies of the present subject technology are identified in Table I. The polynucleotide sequences shown are to be understood to be illustrative, rather than limiting. One of skill in the art can readily determine the polynucleotide sequences that would encode a given polypeptide and can readily generate coding sequences suitable for expression in a given expression system, such as by adapting the polynucleotide sequences provided and/or by generating them de novo, and can readily produce codon-optimized expression sequences, for example as described in published U.S. Patent Application No. 2008/0120732 or using other methods known in the art.

[0225] In another embodiment, the subject technology is directed to an isolated polynucleotide comprising the polynucleotide sequence encoding an anti-IL-6 Vl antibody amino acid sequence 74 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 selected from SEQ ID NO: 2, 20, 647, 651, 660, 666, 699, 702, 706, and 709 or encoding a variant thereof wherein at least one framework residue (FR residue) has been substituted with an amino acid present at the corresponding position in a rabbit anti-IL-6 antibody Vl polypeptide or a conservative amino acid substitution. [0226] In yet another embodiment, the subject technology is directed to at least one heterologous polynucleotides comprising a sequence encoding the polypeptides set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2 and ID NO: 19. [0227] In another embodiment, the subject technology is directed to an isolated polynucleotide that expresses a polypeptide containing at least one CDR polypeptide derived from an anti-IL-6 antibody wherein said expressed polypeptide alone specifically binds IL-6 or specifically binds IL-6 when expressed in association with another polynucleotide sequence that expresses a polypeptide containing at least one CDR polypeptide derived from an anti-IL-6 antibody wherein said at least one CDR is selected from those contained in the Vl or Vh polypeptides set forth in SEQ ID NO: 3, 18, 19, 652, 656, 657, 658, 661, 664, 665, 704, 708, 2, 20, 647, 651, 660, 666, 699, 702, 706, or 709. [0228] Host cells and vectors comprising said polynucleotides are also contemplated. [0229] In another specific embodiment the subject technology covers nucleic acid constructs containing any of the foregoing nucleic acid sequences and combinations thereof as well as recombinant cells containing these nucleic acid sequences and constructs containing wherein these nucleic acid sequences or constructs may be extrachromosomal or integrated into the host cell genome. [0230] The subject technology further contemplates vectors comprising the polynucleotide sequences encoding the variable heavy and light chain polypeptide sequences, as well as the individual complementarity determining regions (CDRs, or hypervariable regions) set forth herein, as well as host cells comprising said sequences. In one embodiment of the subject technology, the host cell is a yeast cell. In another embodiment of the subject technology, the yeast host cell belongs to the genus Pichia.

[0236] The phrase \"high stringency hybridization conditions\" refers to conditions under which a probe will hybridize to its target subsequence, typically in a complex mixture of nucleic acid, but to no other sequences. High stringency conditions are sequence dependent and will be different in 78 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 different circumstances. Longer sequences hybridize specifically at higher temperatures. An extensive guide to the hybridization of nucleic acids is found in Tijssen, Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology-Hybridization with Nucleic Probes, \"Overview of principles of hybridization and the strategy of nucleic acid assays\" (1993). Generally, high stringency conditions are selected to be about 5-10 0C lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength pH. The Tm is the temperature (under defined ionic strength, pH, and nucleic concentration) at which 50% of the probes complementary to the target hybridize to the target sequence at equilibrium (as the target sequences are present in excess, at Tm, 50% of the probes are occupied at equilibrium). High stringency conditions will be those in which the salt concentration is less than about 1.0 M sodium ion, typically about 0.01 to 1.0 M sodium ion concentration (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3 and the temperature is at least about 30 0C for short probes (e.g., 10 to 50 nucleotides) and at least about 60 0C for long probes (e.g., greater than 50 nucleotides). High stringency conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents such as formamide. For selective or specific hybridization, a positive signal is at least two times background, optionally 10 times background hybridization. Exemplary high stringency hybridization conditions can be as following: 50% formamide, 5><SSC, 1% SDS, incubating at 42 0C, or, 5><SSC, 1% SDS, incubating at 65 0C, with wash in 0.2><SSC, and 0.1% SDS at 65 \u00b0C. Such hybridizations and wash steps can be carried out for, e.g., I, 2, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60; or more minutes. [0237] Nucleic acids that do not hybridize to each other under high stringency conditions are still substantially related if the polypeptides that they encode are substantially related. This occurs, for example, when a copy of a nucleic acid is created using the maximum codon degeneracy permitted by the genetic code. In such cases, the nucleic acids typically hybridize under moderate stringency stringency formamide, I M NaCl, 1% SDS at 37\u00b0C, and a wash in I xSSC at 45\u00b0C. Such hybridizations and wash steps can be carried out for, e.g., I, 2, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, or more minutes. A positive hybridization is at least twice background. Those of ordinary skill will readily recognize that alternative hybridization and wash conditions can be utilized to provide conditions of similar stringency. [0238] Expression vectors for use in the methods of the subject technology will further include yeast specific sequences, including a selectable auxotrophic or drug marker for identifying transformed yeast strains. A drug marker may further be used to amplify copy number of the vector in a yeast host cell. [0239] The polypeptide coding sequence of interest is operably linked to transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences that provide for expression of the polypeptide in yeast cells. These vector components may include, but are not limited to, at least one of the following: an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence. Sequences for the secretion of the 79 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 polypeptide may also be included, e.g. a signal sequence, and the like. A yeast origin of replication is optional, as expression vectors are often integrated into the yeast genome. [0240] In one embodiment of the subject technology, the polypeptide of interest is operably linked, or fused, to sequences providing for optimized secretion of the polypeptide from yeast diploid cells. [0241] Nucleic acids are \"operably linked\" when placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a signal sequence is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence. Generally, \"operably linked\" means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading frame. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites or alternatively via a PCR/recombination method familiar to those skilled in the art (Gateway\u00ae Technology; Invitrogen, Carlsbad California). If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adapters or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice. [0242] Promoters are untranslated sequences located upstream (5') to the start codon of a structural gene (generally within about 100 to 1000 bp) that control the transcription and translation of particular nucleic acid sequences to which they are operably linked. Such promoters fall into several classes: inducible, constitutive, and repressible promoters (that increase levels of transcription in response to absence of a repressor). Inducible promoters may initiate increased levels of transcription from DNA under their control in response to some change in culture conditions, e.g., the presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature. [0243] The yeast promoter fragment may also serve as the site for homologous recombination and integration of the expression vector into the same site in the yeast genome; alternatively a selectable marker is used as the site for homologous recombination. Pichia transformation is described in Cregg, et al. 11985) Mol. Cell. Biol. 5:3376-3385. [0244] Examples of suitable promoters from Pichia include the AOXl and promoter (Cregg, et al. (1989) Mol. Cell. Biol. 9:1316-1323); ICLl glyceraldehyde-3 -phosphate dehydrogenase Gene 186( 1):37\u2014 44); and FLDl promoter (Shen, et al. (1998) Gene 216(1):93-102). The G JPpromoteris a strong constitutive promoter and the AOX and FLDI promoters are inducible. [0245] Other derived therefrom. Additionally, non-yeast promoters may be used in the subject technology such as mammalian, insect, plant, reptile, amphibian, viral, and avian promoters. Most typically the promoter will comprise a mammalian promoter (potentially endogenous to the expressed genes) or will comprise a yeast or viral promoter that provides for efficient transcription in yeast systems. 80 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 [0246] The polypeptides of interest may be produced recombinantly not only directly, but also as a fusion polypeptide with a heterologous polypeptide, e.g. a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide. In general, the signal sequence may be a component of the vector, or it may be a part of the polypeptide coding sequence that is inserted into the vector. The heterologous signal sequence selected preferably is one that is recognized and processed through one of the standard pathways available within the host cell. The S. cerevisiae alpha factor pre-pro signal has proven effective in the secretion of a variety of recombinant proteins from P. pastoris. Other yeast signal sequences include the alpha mating factor signal sequence, the invertase signal sequence, and signal sequences derived from other secreted yeast polypeptides. Additionally, these signal peptide sequences may be engineered to provide for enhanced secretion in diploid yeast expression systems. Other secretion signals of interest also include mammalian signal sequences, which may be heterologous to the protein being secreted, or may be a native sequence for the protein being secreted. Signal sequences include pre-peptide sequences, and in some instances may include propeptide sequences. Many such signal sequences are known in the art, including the signal sequences found on immunoglobulin chains, e.g., K28 preprotoxin human MCP-1, human serum albumin signal sequences, human Ig heavy chain, human Ig light chain, and the like. See Hashimoto, et al. (1998) Protein Eng 11(2): 75; and Kobayashi, et al. (1998) Therapeutic Apheresis 2(4): 257. [0247] Transcription may be increased by inserting a transcriptional activator sequence into the vector. These activators are cis-acting elements of DNA, usually about from 10 to 300 bp, which act on a promoter to increase its transcription. Transcriptional enhancers are relatively orientation and position independent, having been found 5' and 3' to the transcription unit, within an intron, as well as within the coding sequence itself. The enhancer may be spliced into the expression vector at a position 5 ' or 3 ' to the coding sequence, but is preferably located at a site 5 ' from the promoter. [0248] Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells may also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from 3 ' to the translation termination codon, in untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA. [0249] Construction of suitable vectors containing at least one of the above-listed components employs standard ligation techniques or PCR/recombination methods. Isolated plasmids or DNA fragments are cleaved, tailored, and re-ligated in the form desired to generate the plasmids required or via recombination methods. For analysis to confirm correct sequences in plasmids constructed, the ligation mixtures are used to transform host cells, and successful transformants selected by antibiotic resistance {e.g. ampicillin or Zeocin\u00ae (phleomycin)) where appropriate. Plasmids from the transformants are prepared, analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion and/or sequenced. 81 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 [0250] As an alternative to restriction and ligation of fragments, recombination methods based on att sites and recombination enzymes may be used to insert DNA sequences into a vector. Such methods are described, for example, by Landy (1989) Ann. Rev. Biochem. 58: 913-949; and are known to those of skill in the art. Such methods utilize intermolecular DNA recombination that is mediated by a mixture of lambda and E. coli -encoded recombination proteins. Recombination occurs between specific attachment ( att) sites on the interacting DNA molecules. For a description of att sites see Weisberg and Landy (1983) Site-Specific Recombination in Phage Lambda Cold Spring Harbor, NY:Cold Spring Harbor Press), pages 211-250. The DNA segments flanking the recombination sites are switched, such that after recombination, the att sites are hybrid sequences comprised of sequences donated by each parental vector. The recombination can occur between DNAs of any topology. [0251] Att sites may be introduced into a sequence of interest by ligating the sequence of interest into an appropriate vector; generating a PCR product containing att B sites through the use of specific primers; generating a cDNA library cloned into an appropriate vector containing att sites. [0252] The expression host may be further modified by the introduction of sequences encoding at least one enzymes that enhance folding and disulfide bond formation, i.e. foldases, chaperonins, Such sequences may be constitutively or inducibly expressed in the yeast host cell, using vectors, markers, are known in the art. Preferably the sequences, including transcriptional regulatory elements sufficient for the desired pattern of expression, are stably integrated in the yeast genome through a targeted methodology. [0253] For example, the eukaryotic PDI is not only an efficient catalyst of protein cysteine oxidation and disulfide bond isomerization, but also exhibits chaperone activity. Co-expression of PDI can facilitate the production of active proteins having multiple disulfide bonds. Also of interest is the expression of BIP (immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein); cyclophilin; and the like. In one embodiment of the subject technology, each of the haploid parental strains expresses a distinct folding enzyme, e.g. one strain may express BIP, and the other strain may express PDI or combinations thereof. [0254] Vectors are used to introduce a foreign substance, such as DNA, RNA or protein, into an organism or host cell. Typical vectors include recombinant viruses (for polynucleotides) and liposomes or other lipid aggregates (for polypeptides and/or polynucleotides). A \"DNA vector\" is a replicon, plasmid, phage or cosmid, to which another polynucleotide segment may be attached so as to bring about the replication of the attached segment. An \"expression vector\" is a DNA vector which contains regulatory sequences which will direct polypeptide synthesis by an appropriate host cell. This usually means a promoter to bind RNA polymerase and initiate transcription of mRNA, as well as ribosome binding sites and initiation signals to direct translation of the mRNA into a polypeptide(s). Incorporation of a polynucleotide sequence into an expression vector at the proper 82 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 site and in correct reading frame, followed by transformation of an appropriate host cell by the vector, enables the production of a polypeptide encoded by said polynucleotide sequence. Exemplary expression vectors and techniques for their use are described in the following publications: Old, et al. (1989) Principles of Gene Manipulation: An Introduction to Genetic Engineering. Blackwell Scientific Publications, 4th edition,; Sam brook, et al (1989) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; Sambrook et al. (20011 Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; Gorman, \"High Efficiency Gene Transfer into Mammalian Cells,\" in DNA Cloning, Volume II, Glover, D.

In a preferred embodiment, the anti-IL-6 antibody or fragment or variant thereof may specifically bind to the same linear or conformational epitope(s) and/or compete for binding to the same linear or conformational epitope(s) on an intact human IL-6 polypeptide or a fragment thereof as Abl and chimeric, humanized, single chain antibodies and fragments thereof (containing at least one CDRs of the afore-mentioned antibody) that specifically bind IL-6, which preferably are aglycosylated.

[0259] In another embodiment, the subject technology is also directed to an isolated anti-IL-6 antibody or antibody fragment or variant thereof comprising at least one of the CDRs contained in the Vh polypeptide sequences comprising: SEQ ID NO: 3, 18, 19, 22, 38, 54, 70, 86, 102, 117, 118, 123, 139, 155, 171, 187, 203, 219, 235, 251, 267, 283, 299, 315, 331, 347, 363, 379, 395, 411, 427, 443, 459, 475, 491, 507, 523, 539, 555, 571, 652, 656, 657, 658, 661, 664, 665, 668, 672, 676, 680, 684, 688, 691, 692, 704, or 708 and/or at least one of the CDRs contained in the Vl polypeptide sequence consisting of: 2, 20,21,37, 53,69, 85, 101, 119, 122, 138, 154, 170, 186, 202,218, 234, 250, 266, 282, 298, 314, 330, 346, 362, 378, 394, 410, 426, 442, 458, 474, 490, 506, 522, 538, 554, 570, 647, 651, 660, 666, 667, 671, 675, 679, 683, 687, 693, 699, 702, 706, or 709 and VH and VL sequences depicted in the antibody alignments comprised in Figures 8-11 of this application. 84 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 [0260] In one embodiment of the subject technology, the anti-IL-6 antibody described herein may comprise at least 2 complementarity determining regions (CDRs) in each the variable light and the variable heavy regions which are identical to those contained in an anti-IL-6 antibody comprising Abl and chimeric, humanized, single chain antibodies and fragments thereof (containing at least one CDRs of the afore-mentioned antibody) that specifically bind IL-6, which preferably are aglycosylated. [0261] In a preferred embodiment, the anti-IL-6 antibody described herein may comprise at least 2 complementarity determining regions (CDRs) in each the variable light and the variable heavy regions which are identical to those contained in A bl. In another embodiment, all of the CDRs of the anti-IL- 6 antibody discussed above are identical to the CDRs contained in an anti-IL-6 antibody comprising Ab I and chimeric, humanized, single chain antibodies and fragments thereof (containing at least one CDRs of the afore-mentioned antibody) that specifically bind IL-6, which preferably are aglycosylated. In a preferred embodiment of the subject technology, all of the CDRs of the anti-IL-6 antibody discussed above are identical to the CDRs contained in AbI, e.g., an antibody comprised of the VH and VL sequences comprised in SEQ ID NO: 657 and SEQ ID NO: 709 respectively. [0262] The subject technology further contemplates that the one or more anti-IL-6 antibodies discussed above are aglycosylated or substantially non-glycosylated (e.g., may contain one or more, e.g., 1-5 mannose residues); that contain an Fe region that has been modified to alter effector function, half-life, proteolysis, and/or glycosylation; are human, humanized, single chain or chimeric; and are a humanized antibody derived from a rabbit (parent) anti-IL-6 antibody. Exemplary constant regions that provide for the production of aglycosylated antibodies in Pichia are comprised in SEQ ID NO: 588 and SEQ ID NO: 586 which respectively are encoded by the nucleic acid sequences in SEQ ID NO: 589 and SEQ ID NO: 587. [0263] The subject technology further contemplates at least one anti-IL-6 antibodies wherein the framework regions (FRs) in the variable light region and the variable heavy regions of said antibody respectively are human FRs which are unmodified or which have been modified by the substitution of at most 2 or 3 human FR residues in the variable light or heavy chain region with the corresponding FR residues of the parent rabbit antibody, and wherein said human FRs have been derived from human variable heavy and light chain antibody sequences which have been selected from a library of human germline antibody sequences based on their high level of homology to the corresponding rabbit variable heavy or light chain regions relative to other human germline antibody sequences contained in the library. [0264] In one embodiment of the subject technology, the anti-IL-6 antibody or fragment or variant thereof may specifically bind to IL-6 expressing human cells and/or to circulating soluble IL-6 molecules in vivo, including IL-6 expressed on or by human cells in a patient with a disease associated with cells that express IL-6. 85 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 [0265] The subject technology further contemplates anti-IL-6 antibodies or fragments or variants thereof directly or indirectly attached to a detectable label or therapeutic agent. [0266] The subject technology also contemplates at least one nucleic acid sequences which result in the expression of an anti-IL-6 antibody or antibody fragment or variant thereof as set forth above, including those comprising, or alternatively consisting of, yeast or human preferred codons. The subject technology also contemplates vectors (including plasmids or recombinant viral vectors) comprising said nucleic acid sequence(s). The subject technology also contemplates host cells or recombinant host cells expressing at least one of the antibodies set forth above, including a mammalian, yeast, bacterial, and insect cells. In a preferred embodiment, the host cell is a yeast cell. In a further preferred embodiment, the yeast cell is a diploidal yeast cell. In a more preferred embodiment, the yeast cell is a Pichia yeast. [0267] The subject technology also contemplates a method of treatment comprising administering to a patient with a disease or condition associated with psoriatic arthritis a therapeutically effective amount of at least one anti-IL-6 antibody or antigen-binding fragment or variant thereof. The diseases that may be treated are presented in the non-limiting list set forth above. In another embodiment the treatment further includes the administration of another therapeutic agent or regimen selected from chemotherapy, radiotherapy, cytokine administration or gene therapy agent. For example, drugs associated with the treatment of psoriatic arthritis including but not limited to TNF- inhibitors, glyococordicoids, triamcinolone, dexamethasone, prednisone, may also be administered sequentially or subsequently with at least one anti-IL-6 antibody or antigen-binding fragment or variant thereof described herein. Further examples of drugs associated with the treatment of psoriatic arthritis include but are not stated previously, IL-6 is a member of a family of cytokines that promote cellular responses through a receptor complex consisting of at least one subunit of the signal-transducing glycoprotein gpl30 and the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R). The IL-6R may also be present in a soluble form (sIL-6R). IL-6 binds to IL-6R, which then dimerizes the signal-transducing receptor gpl30. [0269] It is believed that the anti-IL-6 antibodies of the subject technology, or IL-6 binding fragments or variants thereof, are useful by exhibiting anti-IL-6 activity. In one non-limiting embodiment of the subject technology, the anti-IL-6 antibodies of the subject technology, or IL-6 binding fragments or variants thereof, exhibit anti-IL-6 activity by binding to IL-6 which may be soluble IL-6 or cell surface expressed IL-6 and/or may prevent or inhibit the binding of IL-6 to IL-6R and/or activation (dimerization) of the gp!30 signal-transducing glycoprotein and formation of IL- 86 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 6/IL-6R/gpl30 multimers and the biological effects of any of the foregoing. The subject anti-IL-6 antibodies may possess different antagonistic activities based on where (i.e., epitope) the particular antibody binds IL-6 and/or how it affects the formation of the foregoing IL-6 complexes and/or multimers and the biological effects thereof. Consequently, different anti-IL-6 antibodies according to the subject technology e.g., may be better suited for preventing or treating conditions involving the formation and accumulation of substantial soluble IL-6 such as rheumatoid arthritis whereas other antibodies may be favored in treatments wherein the prevention of IL-6/IL-6R/gpl30 or IL-6/IL- 6R/gpl30 multimers is a desired therapeutic outcome. This can be determined in binding and other assays. [0270] The anti-IL-6 activity of the anti-IL-6 antibody of the present subject technology, and fragments and variants thereof having binding specificity to IL-6, may also be described by their strength of binding or their affinity for IL-6. This also may affect their therapeutic properties. In one embodiment of the subject technology, the anti-IL-6 antibodies of the present subject technology, and fragments thereof having binding specificity to IL-6, bind to IL-6 with a dissociation constant (K0) of less than 5 or 10'1 5 . Preferably, the anti-IL-6 antibodies and fragments and variants thereof bind IL-6 with a dissociation constant of less than or equal to 5xl0'1 0 . [0271] In another embodiment of the subject technology, the anti-IL-6 activity of the anti-IL-6 antibodies of the present subject technology, and fragments and variants thereof having binding specificity to IL-6, bind to IL-6 with an off-rate of less than or equal to IO 4 one embodiment of the subject technology, the anti-IL-6 antibodies of the subject technology, and fragments and variants thereof having binding specificity to IL-6, bind to a linear or conformational IL-6 epitope. [0272] In a further embodiment of the subject technology, the anti-IL-6 activity of the anti-IL-6 antibodies of the present subject technology, and fragments and variants thereof having binding specificity to IL-6, exhibit anti-IL-6 activity by ameliorating or reducing the symptoms of, or alternatively treating, or preventing, diseases and disorders associated with IL-6. Non-limiting examples of diseases and disorders associated with IL-6 are set forth infra. In another embodiment of the subject technology, the anti-IL-6 antibodies described herein, or IL-6 binding fragments and variants thereof, do not have binding specificity for IL-6R or the gp-130 signal-transducing glycoprotein. B-cell Screening and Isolation [0273] In one embodiment, the present subject technology provides methods of isolating a clonal population of antigen-specific B cells that may be used for isolating at least one antigen-specific cell. As described and exemplified infra, these methods contain a series of culture and selection steps that can be used separately, in combination, sequentially, repetitively, or periodically. Preferably, these 87 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 methods are used for isolating at least one antigen-specific cell, which can be used to produce a monoclonal antibody, which is specific to a desired antigen, or a nucleic acid sequence corresponding to such an antibody. [0274] In one embodiment, the present subject technology provides a method comprising the steps of: (a) preparing a cell population comprising at least one antigen-specific B cell; (b) enriching the cell population, e.g., by chromatography, to form an enriched cell population comprising at least one antigen-specific B cell; (c) isolating a single B cell from the enriched B cell population; and (d) determining whether the single B cell produces an antibody specific to the antigen. [0275] In another embodiment, the present subject technology provides an improvement to a method of isolating a single, antibody-producing B cell, the improvement comprising enriching a B cell population obtained from a host that has been immunized or naturally exposed to an antigen, wherein the enriching step precedes any selection steps, comprises at least one culturing step, and results in a clonal population of B cells that produces a single monoclonal antibody specific to said antigen. [0276] Throughout this application, a \"clonal population of B cells\" refers to a population of B cells that only secrete a single antibody specific to a desired antigen. That is to say that these cells produce only one type of monoclonal antibody specific to the desired antigen. [0277] In the present application, \"enriching\" a cell population cells means increasing the frequency of desired cells, typically antigen-specific cells, contained in a mixed cell population, e.g., a B cell-containing isolate derived from a host that is immunized against a desired antigen. Thus, an enriched cell population encompasses a cell population having a higher frequency of antigen-specific cells as a result of an enrichment step, but this population of cells may contain and produce different antibodies. [0278] The general term \"cell population\" encompasses pre- and a post-enrichment cell populations, keeping in mind that when multiple enrichment steps are performed, a cell population can be both pre- and post-enrichment. For example, in one embodiment, the present subject technology provides a method: (a) harvesting a cell population from an immunized host to obtain a harvested cell population; (b) creating at least one single cell suspension from the harvested cell population; (c) enriching at least one single cell suspension to form a first enriched cell population; (d) enriching the first enriched cell population to form a second enriched cell population; 88 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 (e) enriching the second enriched cell population to form a third enriched cell population; and (f) selecting an antibody produced by an antigen-specific cell of the third enriched cell population. [0279] Each cell population may be used directly in the next step, or it can be partially or wholly frozen for long- or short- term storage or for later steps. Also, cells from a cell population can be individually suspended to yield single cell suspensions. The single cell suspension can be enriched, such that a single cell suspension serves as the pre-enrichment cell population. Then, at least one antigen-specific single cell suspensions together form the enriched cell population; the antigen- specific single cell suspensions can be grouped together, e.g., re-plated for further analysis and/or antibody production. [0280] In one embodiment, the present subject technology provides a method of enriching a cell population to yield an enriched cell population having an antigen-specific cell frequency that is about 50% to about 100%, or increments therein. Preferably, the enriched cell population has an antigen- specific cell frequency at least about embodiment, the present subject technology provides a method of enriching a cell population whereby the frequency of antigen-specific cells is increased by at least about 2-fold, 5- fold, 10-fold, 20-fold, 50-fold, 100-fold, or increments therein. [0282] Throughout this application, the term \"increment\" is used to define a numerical value in varying degrees of precision, e.g., to the nearest 10, I, 0.1, 0.01. The increment can be rounded to any measurable degree of precision, and the increment need not be rounded to the same degree of precision on both sides of a range. For example, the range I to 100 or increments therein includes ranges such as 20 to 80, 5 to 50, and 0.4 to 98. When a range is open-ended, e.g., a range of less than 100, increments therein means increments between 100 and the measurable limit. For example, less than 100 or increments therein means 0 to 100 or increments therein unless the feature, e.g., temperature, is not limited by 0. [0283] Antigen-specificity can be measured with respect to any antigen. The antigen can be any substance to which an antibody can bind including, but not limited to, peptides, proteins or fragments thereof; carbohydrates; organic and inorganic molecules; receptors produced by animal cells, bacterial cells, and viruses; enzymes; agonists and antagonists of biological pathways; hormones; and cytokines. Exemplary antigens include, but Factor (HGF) and Hepcidin. In a method utilizing more than one enrichment step, the antigen used in each enrichment step can be the same as or different from one another. Multiple enrichment steps with the same antigen may yield a large and/or diverse population of antigen-specific cells; multiple enrichment steps with different antigens may yield an enriched cell population with cross-specificity to the different antigens. 89 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 [0284] Enriching a cell population can be performed by any cell-selection means known in the art for isolating antigen-specific cells. For example, a cell population can be enriched by chromatographic techniques, e.g., Miltenyi bead or magnetic bead technology. The beads can be directly or indirectly attached to the antigen of interest. In a preferred embodiment, the method of enriching a cell population includes at least one chromatographic enrichment step. [0285] A cell population can also be enriched by performed by any antigen-specificity assay technique known in the art, e.g., an ELISA assay or a halo assay. ELISA assays include, but are not limited to, selective antigen immobilization (e.g., biotinylated antigen capture by streptavidin, avidin, or neutravidin coated plate), non-specific antigen plate coating, and through an antigen build-up strategy (e.g., selective antigen capture followed by binding partner addition to generate a heteromeric protein-antigen complex). The antigen can be directly or indirectly attached to a solid matrix or support, e.g., a column. A halo assay comprises contacting the cells with antigen-loaded beads and labeled anti-host antibody specific to the host used to harvest the B cells. The label can be, e.g., a fluorophore. In one embodiment, at least one assay enrichment step is performed on at least one single cell suspension. In another embodiment, the method of enriching a cell population includes at least one chromatographic enrichment step and at least one assay enrichment step. [0286] Methods of \"enriching\" a cell population by size or density are known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Patent 5,627,052. These steps can be used in the present method in addition to enriching the cell population by antigen-specificity. [0287] The cell populations of the present subject technology contain at least one cell capable of recognizing an antigen. Antigen-recognizing cells include, but are not limited to, B cells, plasma cells, and progeny thereof. In one embodiment, the present subject technology provides a clonal cell population containing a single type of antigen-specific B-cell, i.e., the cell population produces a single monoclonal antibody specific to a desired antigen. [0288] In such embodiment, it is believed that the clonal antigen-specific population of B cells consists predominantly of antigen-specific, antibody-secreting cells, which are obtained by the novel culture and selection protocol provided herein. Accordingly, the present subject technology also provides methods for obtaining an enriched cell population containing at least one antigen-specific, antibody-secreting cell. In one embodiment, the present subject technology provides an enriched cell population containing about 50% to about 100%, or increments therein, at least about 60%, In one embodiment, the present subject technology provides a method of isolating a single B cell by enriching a cell population obtained from a host before any selection steps, e.g., selecting a particular B cell from a cell population and/or selecting an antibody produced by a particular cell. The enrichment step can be performed as one, two, three, or more steps. In one embodiment, a single 90 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 B cell is isolated from an enriched cell population before confirming whether the single B cell secretes an antibody with antigen-specificity and/or a desired property. [0290] In one embodiment, a method of enriching a cell population is used in a method for antibody production and/or selection. Thus, the present subject technology provides a method comprising enriching a cell population before selecting an antibody. The method can include the steps of: preparing a cell population comprising at least one antigen-specific cell, enriching the cell population by isolating at least one antigen-specific cell to form an enriched cell population, and inducing antibody production from at least one antigen-specific cell. In a preferred embodiment, the enriched cell population contains more than one antigen-specific cell. In one embodiment, each antigen-specific cell of the enriched population is cultured under conditions that yield a clonal antigen-specific B cell population before isolating an antibody producing cell therefrom and/or producing an antibody using said B cell, or a nucleic acid sequence corresponding to such an antibody. In contrast to prior techniques where antibodies are produced from a cell population with a low frequency of antigen-specific cells, the present subject technology allows antibody selection from among a high frequency of antigen-specific cells. Because an enrichment step is used prior to antibody selection, the majority of the cells, preferably virtually all of the cells, used for antibody production are antigen-specific. By producing antibodies from a population of cells with an increased frequency of antigen specificity, the quantity and variety of antibodies are increased. [0291] In the antibody selection methods of the present subject technology, an antibody is preferably selected after an enrichment step and a culture step that results in a clonal population of antigen-specific B cells. The methods can further comprise a step of sequencing a selected antibody or portions thereof from at least one isolated, antigen-specific cells. Any method known in the art for sequencing can be employed and can include sequencing the heavy chain, light chain, variable region(s), and/or complementarity determining region(s) (CDR). [0292] In addition to the enrichment step, the method for antibody selection can also include at least one steps of screening a cell population for antigen recognition and/or antibody functionality. For example, the desired antibodies may have specific structural features, such as binding to a particular epitope or mimicry of a particular structure; antagonist or agonist activity; or neutralizing activity, e.g., inhibiting binding between the antigen and a ligand. In one embodiment, the antibody functionality screen is ligand-dependent. Screening for antibody functionality includes, but is not limited to, an in vitro protein-protein interaction assay that recreates the natural interaction of the antigen ligand with recombinant receptor protein; and a cell-based response that is ligand dependent and easily monitored (e.g., proliferation response). In one embodiment, the method for antibody selection includes a step of screening the cell population for antibody functionality by measuring the inhibitory concentration (IC50). In one embodiment, at least one of the isolated, antigen-specific cells 91 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 produces an antibody having an IC50 of less than about 100, 50, 30, 25, 10 pg/mL, or increments therein. [0293] In addition to the enrichment step, the method for antibody selection can also include at least one steps of screening a cell population for antibody binding strength. Antibody binding strength can be measured by any method known in the art (e.g., Biacore\u00ae). In one embodiment, at least one of the isolated, antigen-specific cells produces an antibody having a high antigen affinity, e.g., a dissociation constant (Kd) of less than about 5xlO'1 0 M -l, preferably about IxIO'1 3 to , IxlO'1 1 to 2xl0'n, about 1.5xl0'u or less, or increments therein. In this embodiment, the antibodies are said to be affinity mature. In a preferred embodiment, the affinity of the antibodies is comparable to or higher than the affinity of any one the affinity of the antibodies is comparable to or higher than the affinity of Humira\u00ae. The affinity of an antibody can also be increased by known affinity maturation techniques. In one embodiment, at least one cell population is screened for at least one of, preferably both, antibody functionality and antibody binding strength. [0294] In addition to the enrichment step, the method for antibody selection can also include at least one steps of screening a cell population for antibody sequence homology, especially human homology. In one embodiment, at least one of the isolated, antigen-specific cells produces an antibody that has a homology to a human antibody of at least about 50% to about 100%, or increments therein, or at least about 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% homologous. The antibodies can be humanized to increase the homology to a human sequence by techniques known in the art such as CDR grafting or selectivity determining residue grafting (SDR). [0295] In another embodiment, the present subject technology also provides the antibodies themselves according to any of the embodiments described above in terms of IC50, Kd, and/or homology. Methods o f Humanizing Antibodies [0296] In another embodiment of the subject technology, there is provided a method for humanizing antibody heavy and light chains. In this embodiment, the following method is followed for the humanization of the heavy and light chains: [0297] Light Chain [0298] I. Identify the amino acid that is the first one following the signal peptide sequence. This is the start of Framework I. The signal peptide starts at the first initiation methionine and is typically, but not necessarily 22 amino acids in length for rabbit light chain protein sequences. The start of the mature polypeptide can also be determined experimentally by N-terminal protein sequencing, or can 92 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 be predicted using a prediction algorithm. This is also the start of Framework I as classically defined by those in the field. [0299] Example: RbtVL Amino acid residue I in Fig. I, 'AYDM...' (SEQ ID NO: 733) [0300] 2. IdentiiytheendofFramework [0301] 3. This is typically 86-90 amino acids following the start of Framework I and is typically a cysteine residue preceded by two tyrosine residues. This is the end of the Framework 3 as classically defined by those in the field. [0302] Example: RbtVL amino acid residue 88 in Fig. I, ending as 'TYYC' (SEQ ID NO: 733) [0303] 3. Use the rabbit light chain sequence of the polypeptide starting from the beginning of Framework I to the end of Framework 3 as defined above and perform a sequence homology search for the most similar human antibody protein sequences. This will typically be a search against human germline sequences prior to antibody maturation in order to reduce the possibility of immunogenicity, however any human sequences can be used. Typically a program like BLAST can be used to search a database of sequences for the most homologous. Databases of human antibody sequences can be found from various sources such as NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information). [0304] Example: RbtVL amino acid sequence from residues numbered I through 88 in Fig. I is BLASTed against a human antibody germline database. The top three unique returned sequences are shown in Fig. I as L12A (SEQ ID 734), [0305] 4. Generally the most homologous human germline variable light chain sequence is then used as the basis for humanization. However those skilled in the art may decide to use another sequence that wasn't the highest homology as determined by the homology algorithm, based on other factors including sequence gaps and framework similarities. [0306] Example: In Fig. I, L12A (SEQ ID NO: 734) was the most homologous human germline variable light chain sequence and is used as the basis for the humanization of RbtVL. [0307] 5. Determine the FR3, CDRl & CDR2) for the human homolog being used for the light chain humanization. This is using the traditional layout as described in the field. Align the rabbit variable light chain sequence with the human homolog, while maintaining the layout of the framework and CDR regions. [0308] Example: In Fig. I, the RbtVL sequence is aligned with the human homologous sequence L12A, and the framework and CDR domains are indicated. [0309] 6. Replace the human homologous light chain sequence CDRl and CDR2 regions with the CDRl and CDR2 sequences from the rabbit sequence. If there are differences in length between the rabbit and human CDR sequences then use the entire rabbit CDR sequences and their lengths. It is possible that the specificity, affinity and/or immunogenicity of the resulting humanized antibody may be unaltered if smaller or larger sequence exchanges are performed, or if specific residue(s) are 93 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 altered, however the exchanges as described have been used successfully, but do not exclude the possibility that other changes may be permitted. [0310] Example: In Fig. I, the CDRl and CDR2 amino acid residues of the human homologous variable light chain L12A are replaced with the CDRl and CDR2 amino acid sequences from the RbtVL rabbit antibody light chain sequence. The human L12A frameworks I, 2 and 3 are unaltered. The resulting humanized sequence is shown below as VLh from residues numbered I through 88. Note that the only residues that are different from the L12A human sequence are underlined, and are thus rabbit-derived amino acid residues. In this example only 8 of the 88 residues are different than the human sequence. [0311] 7. After framework 3 of the new hybrid sequence created in Step 6, attach the entire CDR3 of the rabbit light chain antibody sequence. The CDR3 sequence can be of various lengths, but is typically 9 to 15 amino acid residues in length. The CDR3 region and the beginning of the following framework 4 region are defined classically and identifiable by those skilled in the art. Typically the beginning of Framework 4, and thus after the end of CDR3 consists of the sequence 'FGGG... ' (SEQ ID NO: 743), however some variation may exist in these residues. [0312] Example: In Fig. I, the CDR3 of RbtVL (amino acid residues numbered 89-100) is added after the end of framework 3 in the humanized sequence indicated as VLh. [0313] 8. The rabbit light chain framework 4, which is typically the final 11 amino acid residues of the variable light chain and begins as indicated in Step 7 above and typically ends with the amino acid sequence '...VVKR' (SEQ ID NO: 744) is replaced with the nearest human light chain framework 4 homolog, usually from germline sequence. Frequently this human light chain framework 4 is of the sequence 'FGGGTKVEIKR' (SEQ ID NO: 745). It is possible that other human light chain framework 4 sequences that are not the most homologous or otherwise different may be used without affecting the specificity, affinity and/or immunogenicity of the resulting humanized antibody. This human light chain framework 4 sequence is added to the end of the variable light chain humanized sequence immediately following the CDR3 sequence from Step 7 above. This is now the end of the variable light chain humanized amino acid sequence. [0314] Example: In Fig. I, Framework 4 (FR4) of the RbtVL rabbit light chain sequence is shown above a homologous human FR4 sequence. The human FR4 sequence is added to the humanized variable light chain sequence (VLh) right after the end of the CD3 region added in Step 7 above. [0315] In addition, Figs. 8 and 9 depict preferred humanized anti-IL-6 variable heavy and variable light chain sequences humanized from the variable heavy and light regions in Abl according to the subject technology. These humanized light and heavy chain regions are respectively contained in the polypeptides set forth in SEQ ID NO: 647, or 651 and in SEQ ID NO: 652, 656, 657 or 658. The CDR2 of the humanized variable heavy region in SEQ ID NO: 657 (containing a serine substitution in CDR2) is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 658. Alignments illustrating variants of the light and heavy chains 94 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 are shown in Figs. 10 and 11, respectively, with sequence differences within the CDR regions highlighted. Sequence identifiers of CDR sequences and of exemplary coding sequences are summarized in Table I, above. [0316] Heavy Chain [0317] I. Identify the amino acid that is the first one following the signal peptide sequence. This is the start of Framework I . The signal peptide starts at the first initiation methionine and is typically 19 amino acids in length for rabbit heavy chain protein sequences. Typically, but not necessarily always, the final 3 amino acid residues of a rabbit heavy chain signal peptide are '...VQC', followed by the start of Framework I. The start of the mature polypeptide can also be determined experimentally by N-terminal protein sequencing, or can be predicted using a prediction algorithm. This is also the start of Framework I as classically defined by those in the field. [0318] Example: RbtVH Amino acid residue I in Fig. I, starting 'QEQL...' (SEQ ID NO: 738) [0319] 2. Identify the end of Framework 3. This is typically 95-100 amino acids following the start of Framework I and typically has the final sequence of '.. .CAR' (although the alanine can also be a valine). This is the end of the Framework 3 as classically defined by those in the field. [0320] Example: RbtVH amino acid residue 98 in Fig. I, ending a s '...FCVR' (SEQ ID NO: 738). [0321] 3. Use the rabbit heavy chain sequence of the polypeptide starting from the beginning of Framework I to the end of Framework 3 as defined above and perform a sequence homology search for the most similar human antibody protein sequences. This will typically be against a database of human germline sequences prior to antibody maturation in order to reduce the possibility of immunogenicity, however any human sequences can be used. Typically a program like BLAST can be used to search a database of sequences for the most homologous. Databases of human antibody sequences can be found from various sources such as NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information). [0322] Example: RbtVH amino acid sequence from residues numbered I through 98 in Fig. I is BLASTed against a human antibody germline database. The top three unique returned sequences are shown in Fig. I as 3-64-04 (SEQ [0323] 4. Generally the most homologous human germline variable heavy chain sequence is then used as the basis for humanization. However those skilled in the art may decide to use another sequence that wasn't the most homologous as determined by the homology algorithm, based on other factors including sequence gaps and framework similarities. [0324] Example: 3-64-04 in Fig. I was the most homologous human germline variable heavy chain sequence and is used as the basis for the humanization of RbtVH. [0325] 5. Determine the FR3, CDRl & CDR2) for the human homolog being used for the heavy chain humanization. This is using the traditional layout 95 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 as described in the field. Align the rabbit variable heavy chain sequence with the human homolog, while maintaining the layout of the framework and CDR regions. [0326] Example: In Fig. I, the RbtVH sequence is aligned with the human homologous sequence 3-64-04, and the framework and CDR domains are indicated. [0327] 6. Replace the human homologous heavy chain sequence CDRl and CDR2 regions with the CDRl and CDR2 sequences from the rabbit sequence. If there are differences in length between the rabbit and human CDR sequences then use the entire rabbit CDR sequences and their lengths. In addition, it may be necessary to replace the final three amino acids of the human heavy chain Framework I region with the final three amino acids of the rabbit heavy chain Framework I. Typically but not always, in rabbit heavy chain Framework I these three residues follow a Glycine residue preceded by a Serine residue. In addition, it may be necessary replace the final amino acid of the human heavy chain Framework 2 region with the final amino acid of the rabbit heavy chain Framework 2. Typically, but not necessarily always, this is a Glycine residue preceded by an Isoleucine residue in the rabbit heavy chain Framework 2. It is possible that the specificity, affinity and/or immunogenicity of the resulting humanized antibody may be unaltered if smaller or larger sequence exchanges are performed, or if specific residue(s) are altered, however the exchanges as described have been used successfully, but do not exclude the possibility that other changes may be permitted. For example, a tryptophan amino acid residue typically occurs four residues prior to the end of the rabbit heavy chain CDR2 region, whereas in human heavy chain CDR2 this residue is typically a Serine residue. Changing this rabbit tryptophan residue to a the human Serine residue at this position has been demonstrated to have minimal to no effect on the humanized antibody's specificity or affinity, and thus further minimizes the content of rabbit sequence-derived amino acid residues in the humanized sequence. [0328] Example: In Fig. I, The CDRl and CDR2 amino acid residues of the human homologous variable heavy chain are replaced with the CDRl and CDR2 amino acid sequences from the RbtVH rabbit antibody light chain sequence, except for the boxed residue, which is tryptophan in the rabbit sequence (position number 63) and Serine at the same position in the human sequence, and is kept as the human Serine residue. In addition to the CDRl and CDR2 changes, the final three amino acids of Framework I (positions 28-30) as well as the final residue of Framework 2 (position 49) are retained as rabbit amino acid residues instead of human. The resulting humanized sequence is shown below as VHh from residues numbered I through 98. Note that the only residues that are different from the 3- 64-04 human sequence are underlined, and are thus rabbit-derived amino acid residues. In this example only 15 of the 98 residues are different than the human sequence. [0329] 7. After framework 3 of the new hybrid sequence created in Step 6, attach the entire CDR3 of the rabbit heavy chain antibody sequence. The CDR3 sequence can be of various lengths, but is typically 5 to 19 amino acid residues in length. The CDR3 region and the beginning of the following 96 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 framework 4 region are defined classically and are identifiable by those skilled in the art. Typically the beginning of framework 4, and thus after the end of CDR3 consists of the sequence WGXG.. .(where X is usually Q or P) (SEQ ID NO: 746), however some variation may exist in these residues, [0330] Example: The CDR3 of RbtVH (amino acid residues numbered 99-110) is added after the end of framework 3 in the humanized sequence indicated as VHh. [0331] 8. The rabbit heavy chain framework 4, which is typically the final 11 amino acid residues of the variable heavy chain and begins as indicated in Step 7 above and typically ends with the amino acid sequence '...TVSS' (SEQ ID NO: 747) is replaced with the nearest human heavy chain framework 4 homolog, usually from germline sequence. Frequently this human heavy chain framework 4 is of the sequence 'WGQGTLVTVSS' (SEQ ID NO: 748). It is possible that other human heavy chain framework 4 sequences that are not the most homologous or otherwise different may be used without affecting the specificity, affinity and/or immunogenicity of the resulting humanized antibody. This human heavy chain framework 4 sequence is added to the end of the variable heavy chain humanized sequence immediately following the CDR3 sequence from Step 7 above. This is now the end of the variable heavy chain humanized amino acid sequence. [0332] Example: In Fig. I, framework 4 (FR4) of the RbtVH rabbit heavy chain sequence is shown above a homologous human heavy FR4 sequence. The human FR4 sequence is added to the humanized variable heavy chain sequence (VHh) right after the end of the CD3 region added in Step 7 above. Methods o f Producing Antibodies and Fragments thereof [0333] The subject technology is also directed to the production of the antibodies described herein or fragments thereof. Recombinant polypeptides corresponding to the antibodies described herein or fragments thereof are secreted from polyploidal, preferably diploid or tetraploid strains of mating competent yeast. In an exemplary embodiment, the subject technology is directed to methods for producing these recombinant polypeptides in secreted form for prolonged periods using cultures comprising polyploid yeast, i.e., at least several days to a week, more preferably at least a month or several months, and even more preferably at least 6 months to a year or longer. These polyploid yeast cultures will express at least 10-25 mg/liter of the polypeptide, more preferably at least 50-250 mg/liter, still more preferably at least 500-1000 mg/liter, and most preferably a gram per liter or more of the recombinant polypeptide(s). [0334] In one embodiment of the subject technology a pair of genetically marked yeast haploid cells are transformed with expression vectors comprising subunits of a desired heteromultimeric protein. One haploid cell comprises a first expression vector, and a second haploid cell comprises a second expression vector. In another embodiment diploid yeast cells will be transformed with at least one expression vectors that provide for the expression and secretion of at least one of the recombinant 97 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 polypeptides, In still another embodiment a single haploid cell may be transformed with at least one vectors and used to produce a polyploidal yeast by fusion or mating strategies. In yet another embodiment a diploid yeast culture may be transformed with at least one vectors providing for the expression and secretion of a desired polypeptide or polypeptides. These vectors may comprise vectors e.g., linearized plasmids or other linear DNA products that integrate into the yeast cell's genome randomly, through homologous recombination, or using a recombinase such as Cre/Lox or Flp/Frt. Optionally, additional expression vectors may be introduced into the haploid or diploid cells; or the first or second expression vectors may comprise additional coding sequences; for the synthesis of heterotrimers; heterotetramers. The expression levels of the non-identical polypeptides may be individually calibrated, and adjusted through appropriate selection, vector copy number, promoter strength and/or induction and the like. The transformed haploid cells are genetically crossed or fused. The resulting diploid or tetraploid strains are utilized to produce and secrete fully assembled and biologically functional proteins, humanized antibodies described herein or fragments thereof. [0335] The use of diploid or tetraploid cells for protein production provides for unexpected benefits. The cells can be grown for production purposes, i.e. scaled up, and for extended periods of time, in conditions that can be deleterious to the growth of haploid cells, which conditions may include high cell density; growth in minimal media; growth at low temperatures; stable growth in the absence of selective pressure; and which may provide for maintenance of heterologous gene sequence integrity and maintenance of high level expression over time. Without wishing to be bound thereby, the inventors theorize that these benefits may arise, at least in part, from the creation of diploid strains from two distinct parental haploid strains. Such haploid strains can comprise numerous minor autotrophic mutations, which mutations are complemented in the diploid or tetraploid, enabling growth and enhanced production under highly selective conditions. [0336] Transformed mating competent haploid yeast cells provide a genetic method that enables subunit pairing of a desired protein. Haploid yeast strains are transformed with each of two expression vectors, a first vector to direct the synthesis of one polypeptide chain and a second vector to direct the synthesis of a second, non-identical polypeptide chain. The two haploid strains are mated to provide a diploid host where optimized target protein production can be obtained. [0337] Optionally, additional non-identical coding sequence(s) are provided. Such sequences may be present on additional expression vectors or in the first or the second expression vectors. As is known in the art, multiple coding sequences may be independently expressed from individual promoters; or may be coordinately expressed through the inclusion of an \"internal ribosome entry site\" or \"IRES\", which is an element that promotes direct internal ribosome entry to the initiation codon, such as ATG, of a cistron (a protein encoding region), thereby leading to the cap-independent translation of the gene. IRES elements functional in yeast are described by Thompson, et al. (2001) PNAS 98: 12866-12868. 98 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 [0338] In one embodiment of the subject technology, antibody sequences are produced in combination with a secretory J chain, which provides for enhanced stability of IgA. See U.S. Patent Nos. 5,959,177 and 5,202,422. [0339] In a preferred embodiment the two haploid yeast strains are each auxotrophic, and require supplementation of media for growth of the haploid cells. The pair of auxotrophs are complementary, such that the diploid product will grow in the absence of the supplements required for the haploid cells. Many such genetic markers are known in yeast, including requirements for amino acids (e.g. met, lys, his, arg), nucleosides (e.g. ura3, adel); and the like. Amino acid markers may be preferred for the methods of the subject technology. Alternatively diploid cells which contain the desired vectors can be selected by other means, e.g., by use of other markers, such as green fluorescent protein, antibiotic resistance genes, various dominant selectable markers, and the like. [0340] Two transformed haploid cells may be genetically crossed and diploid strains arising from this mating event selected by their hybrid nutritional requirements and/or antibiotic resistance spectra. Alternatively, populations of the two transformed haploid strains are spheroplasted and fused, and diploid progeny regenerated and selected. By either method, diploid strains can be identified and selectively grown based on their ability to grow in different media than their parents. For example, the diploid cells may be grown in minimal medium thatmay include antibiotics. The diploid synthesis strategy has certain advantages. Diploid strains have the potential to produce enhanced levels of heterologous protein through broader complementation to underlying mutations, which may impact the production and/or secretion of recombinant protein. Furthermore, once stable strains have been obtained, any antibiotics used to select those strains do not necessarily need to be continuously present in the growth media. [0341] As noted above, in some embodiments a haploid yeast may be transformed with a single or multiple vectors and mated or fused with a non-transformed cell to produce a diploid cell containing the vector or vectors. In other embodiments, a diploid yeast cell may be transformed with at least one vectors that provide for the expression and secretion of a desired heterologous polypeptide by the diploid yeast cell. [0342] In one embodiment of the subject technology, two haploid strains are transformed with a library of polypeptides, e.g. a library of antibody heavy or light chains. Transformed haploid cells that synthesize the polypeptides are mated with the complementary haploid cells. The resulting diploid cells are screened for functional protein. The diploid cells provide a means of rapidly, conveniently and inexpensively bringing together a large number of combinations of polypeptides for functional testing. This technology is especially applicable for the generation of heterodimeric protein products, where optimized subunit synthesis levels are critical for functional protein expression and secretion. 99 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 [0343] In another embodiment of the subject technology, the expression level ratio of the two subunits is regulated in order to maximize product generation. Heterodimer subunit protein levels have been shown previously to impact the final product generation. Simmons (2002) J Immunol Methods. 263(1-2): 133-47. Regulation can be achieved prior to the mating step by selection for a marker present on the expression vector. By stably increasing the copy number of the vector, the expression level can be increased. In some cases, it may be desirable to increase the level of one chain relative to the other, so as to reach a balanced proportion between the subunits of the polypeptide. Antibiotic resistance markers are useful for this purpose, e.g. Zeocin\u00ae (phleomycin) resistance marker, G418 resistance and provide a means of enrichment for strains that contain multiple integrated copies of an expression vector in a strain by selecting for transformants that are resistant to higher levels of Zeocin\u00ae (phleomycin) or G418. The proper ratio (e.g. 1:1; 1:2) of the subunit genes may be important for efficient protein production. Even when the same promoter is used to transcribe both subunits, many other factors contribute to the final level of protein expressed and therefore, it can be useful to increase the number of copies of one encoded gene relative to the other. Alternatively, diploid strains that produce higher levels of a polypeptide, relative to single copy vector strains, are created by mating two haploid strains, both of which have multiple copies of the expression vectors. [0344] Host cells are transformed with the above-described expression vectors, mated to form diploid strains, and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences. A number of minimal media suitable for the growth of yeast are known in the art. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as phosphate, HEPES), nucleosides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics, trace elements, and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan. [0345] Secreted proteins are recovered from the culture medium. protease inhibitor, such as phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) may be useful to inhibit proteolytic degradation during purification, and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants. The composition may be concentrated, filtered, dialyzed, using methods known in the art. [0346] The diploid cells of the subject technology are grown for production purposes. Such production purposes desirably include growth in minimal media, which media lacks pre-formed amino acids and other complex biomolecules, e.g., media comprising ammonia as a nitrogen source, and glucose as an energy and carbon source, and salts as a source of phosphate, calcium and the like. Preferably such production media lacks selective agents such as antibiotics, amino acids, purines, 100 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 pyrimidines The diploid cells can be grown to high cell density, for example at least about 50 g/L; more usually at least about 100 g/L; and may be at least about 300, about 400, about 500 g/L or more. [0347] In one embodiment of the subject technology, the growth of the subject cells for production purposes is performed at low temperatures, which temperatures may be lowered during log phase, during stationary phase, or both. The term \"low temperature\" refers to temperatures of at least about 15\u00b0C, more usually at least about 17\u00b0C, and may be about 20\u00b0C, and is usually not more than about 25\u00b0C, more usually not more than about 22\u00b0C. In another embodiment of the subject technology, the low temperature is usually not more than about 28\u00b0C. Growth temperature can impact the production of full-length secreted proteins in production cultures, and decreasing the culture growth temperature can strongly enhance the intact product yield. The decreased temperature appears to assist intracellular trafficking through the folding and post-translational processing pathways used by the host to generate the target product, along with reduction of cellular protease degradation. [0348] The methods of the subject technology provide for expression of secreted, active protein, preferably a mammalian protein. In one embodiment, secreted, \"active antibodies\", as used herein, refers to a correctly folded multimer of at least two properly paired chains, which accurately binds to its cognate antigen. Expression levels of active protein are usually at least about 10-50 mg/liter culture, more usually at least about 100 mg/liter, preferably at least about 500 mg/liter, and may be 1000 mg/liter or more. [0349] The methods of the subject technology can provide for increased stability of the host and heterologous coding sequences during production. The stability is evidenced, for example, by maintenance of high levels of expression of time, where the starting level of expression is decreased by not more than about 20%, usually not more than 10%, and may be decreased by not more than about 5% over about 20 doublings, 50 doublings, 100 doublings, or more. [0350] The strain stability also provides for maintenance of heterologous gene sequence integrity over time, where the sequence of the active coding sequence and requisite transcriptional regulatory elements are maintained in at least about 99% of the diploid cells, usually in at least about 99.9% of the diploid cells, and preferably in at least about 99.99% of the diploid cells over about 20 doublings, 50 doublings, 100 doublings, or more. Preferably, substantially all of the diploid cells maintain the sequence of the active coding sequence and requisite transcriptional regulatory elements. [0351] Other methods of producing antibodies are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, methods of producing chimeric antibodies are now well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567; Morrison, et al. 9841 P.N.A.S. USA 81: (1984) Nature 312: 643\u2014 46. [0352] Likewise, other methods of producing humanized antibodies are now well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,225,539; et al. 522-525; Reichmann, et al. (1988) Nature 332: 323-327; al. (1988) Science 239: 1534-36. [0353] Antibody polypeptides of the subject technology having IL-6 binding specificity may also be produced by constructing, using conventional techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, an expression vector containing an operon and a DNA sequence encoding an antibody heavy chain in which the DNA sequence encoding the CDRs required for antibody specificity is derived from a non-human cell source, preferably a rabbit B-cell source, while the DNA sequence encoding the remaining parts of the antibody chain is derived from a human cell source. [0354] A second expression vector is produced using the same conventional means well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, said expression vector containing an operon and a DNA sequence encoding an antibody light chain in which the DNA sequence encoding the CDRs required for antibody specificity is derived from a non-human cell source, preferably a rabbit B-cell source, while the DNA sequence encoding the remaining parts of the antibody chain is derived from a human cell source. [0355] The expression vectors are transfected into a host cell by convention techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art to produce a transfected host cell, said transfected host cell cultured by conventional techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art to produce said antibody polypeptides. [0356] The host cell may be co-transfected with the two expression vectors described above, the first expression vector containing DNA encoding an operon and a light chain-derived polypeptide and the second vector containing DNA encoding an operon and a heavy chain-derived polypeptide. The two vectors contain different selectable markers, but preferably achieve substantially equal expression of the heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively, a single vector may be used, the vector including DNA encoding both the heavy and light chain polypeptides. The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains may comprise cDNA. [0357] The host cells used to express the antibody polypeptides may be either a bacterial cell such as E. coli, or a eukaryotic cell. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the subject technology, a mammalian cell of a well-defined type for this purpose, such as a myeloma cell or a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line may be used. [0358] The general methods by which the vectors may be constructed, transfection methods required to produce the host cell and culturing methods required to produce the antibody polypeptides from said host cells all include conventional techniques. Although preferably the cell line used to produce the antibody is a mammalian cell line, any other suitable cell line, such as a bacterial cell line such as an E. co//-derived bacterial strain, or a yeast cell line, may alternatively be used. 102 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 [0359] Similarly, once produced the antibody polypeptides may be purified according to standard procedures in the art, such as for example cross-flow filtration, ammonium sulphate precipitation, affinity column chromatography and the like. [0360] The antibody polypeptides described herein may also be used for the design and synthesis of either peptide or non-peptide mimetics that would be useful for the same therapeutic applications as the antibody polypeptides of the subject technology. See, for example, Saragobi et al. (1991) Science 253: 792-795.

The recitation that particular sequences may be substituted for one another, where such recitations are made, are understood to be illustrative rather than limiting, and it is also understood that such substitutions are encompassed even when no illustrative examples of substitutions are recited, For example, wherever at least one of the Abl lightchain polypeptides is recited, e.g. any of SEQ ID NO: 2, 20, 647, 651, 660, 666, 699, 702, 706, or 709, another Abl light chain polypeptide may be substituted unless the context indicates otherwise.

S C R E E N IN G A S S A Y S [0367] The subject technology also includes screening assays designed to assist in the identification of diseases and disorders associated with IL-6 in patients exhibiting symptoms of an IL- 6 associated disease or disorder, especially psoriatic arthritis. [0368] In one embodiment of die subject technology, the anti-IL-6 antibodies of the subject technology, or IL-6 binding fragments or variants thereof, are used to detect the presence of IL-6 in a biological sample obtained from a patient exhibiting symptoms of a disease or disorder associated with IL-6.

The anti-IL-6 antibody or binding fragment or variant thereof may be post-translationally modified to include a detectable moiety such as set forth previously in the disclosure. [0370] The IL-6 level in the biological sample is determined using a modified anti-IL-6 antibody or binding fragment or variant thereof as set forth herein, and comparing the level of IL-6 in the biological sample against a standard level of IL-6 (e.g., the level in normal biological samples). The skilled clinician would understand that some variability may exist between normal biological samples, and would take that into consideration when evaluating results. [0371] The above-recited assay may also be useful in monitoring a disease or disorder, where the level of IL-6 obtained in a biological sample from a patient believed to have an IL-6 associated disease or disorder is compared with the level of IL-6 in prior biological samples from the same patient, in order to ascertain whether the IL-6 level in said patient has changed with, for example, a treatment regimen. A skilled clinician would understand that a biological sample includes, but is not limited to, sera, plasma, urine, saliva, mucous, pleural fluid, synovial fluid and spinal fluid. L A B E L S [0372] As stated above, antibodies and fragments and variants thereof may be modified post- translationally to add effector moieties such as chemical linkers, such as for example fluorescent dyes, enzymes, substrates, bioluminescent materials, radioactive materials, and chemiluminescent functional such as biotin, a cytotoxin, 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 [0373] The anti-IL-6 antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof herein may be modified post-translationally to add effector moieties such as chemical linkers, detectable such as for example fluorescent dyes, radioactive materials, agent, radioactive materials, or functional moieties.

Such techniques include, for example, adding PEG moieties (also termed pegylation), and are well-known in the art. See U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0031671. [0376] An anti-IL-6 antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof, described herein may be \"attached\" to a substrate when it is associated with the solid label through a non-random chemical or physical interaction. The attachment may be through a covalent bond. However, attachments need not be covalent or permanent. Materials may be attached to a label through a \"spacer molecule\" or \"linker group.\" Such spacer molecules are molecules that have a first portion that attaches to the biological material and a second portion that attaches to the label.

(1974) Biochemistry 13: antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof described herein may be attached to a substrate. A number of substrates (e.g., solid supports) known in the art are suitable for use with the anti-IL-6 antibody described herein. The substrate may be modified to contain channels or other configurations.

The substrate may be a singular discrete body (e.g., a single tube, a single bead), any number of a plurality of substrate bodies (e.g, a rack of 10 tubes, several beads), or combinations thereof (e.g., a tray comprises a plurality of microtiter plates, a column filled with beads, a microtiter plate filed with beads). [0386] An anti-IL-6 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof may be \"attached\" to a substrate when it is associated with the solid substrate through a non-random chemical or physical interaction. The attachment may be through a covalent bond. However, attachments need not be covalent or permanent. Materials may be attached to a substrate through a \"spacer molecule\" or \"linker group.\" Such spacer molecules are molecules that have a first portion that attaches to the biological material and a second portion that attaches to the substrate. Thus, when attached to the substrate, the spacer molecule separates the substrate and the biological materials, but is attached to both. Methods of attaching biological material (e.g., label) to a substrate are well known in the art, and include but are not limited to chemical coupling. [0387] Plates, such as microtiter plates, which support and contain the solid-phase for solid-phase synthetic reactions may be used. Microtiter plates may house beads that are used as the solid-phase. By \"particle\" or or \"nanoparticle\" or \"microsphere\" herein is meant microparticulate matter having any of a variety of shapes or sizes. The shape may be generally spherical but need not be spherical, being, for example, cylindrical or polyhedral.

The label (e.g., streptavidin) may be bound to a substrate (e.g., bead). A s s e s s m e n t o f I n f la m m a to r y M a r k e r s [0389] Known inflammatory markers (e.g., IL-6) may be measured to assess the risk for psoriatic arthritis or the severity of psoriatic arthritis. These markers may be measured from serum, synovial fluid, or skin biopsies using known methods in the art (e.g., immunoassays). IL-6 Serum Levels [0390] Serum IL-6 levels may be measured as a pharmacodynamic marker evaluate the effect of neutralization of IL-6 levels. Serum IL-6 levels may be measured using an immunoassay (e.g., ELISA assay). A decrease of serum IL-6 levels may be indicative of a lessening of inflammation. Serum Inflammatory Biomarkers [0391] Serum biomarkers may be measured to determine the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other soluble biomarkers that may correlate with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) disease activity including but not limited to acute phase MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9) and other biomarkers associated with inflammation and autoimmune pathways that are known in the art. Soluble biomarkers of bone and cartilage metabolism (e.g., osteocalcin and other collagen degradation products) may also be assessed by an immunoassay (e.g., ELISA). A decrease in a serum inflammatory biomarker may be indicative of a lessening of inflammation. Immunohistochemistry o f Skin Biopsies [0392] Skin biopsies may be collected for biomarker analysis including whole genome array analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Immunohistochemical analysis may include the measurement of epidermal thickness, frequency of resident and inflammatory cell populations (e.g., T cells, macrophages, and keratinocytes) and other inflammatory markers related to the IL-6 pathway known in the art. Specifically, the following specific antigens may be assessed per standard IHC procedure in an inflammatory biomarker in a skin biopsy may be indicative of a lessening of inflammation.

[0394] The compositions described herein may be administered in any of the subdermal, sublingual, transdermal, and transmucosal. The preferred routes of administration are intravenous injection or infusion. The administration can be local, where the composition is administered directly, close to, in the locality, near, at, about, or in the vicinity of, the site(s) of disease, e.g., local (joint) or systemic, wherein the composition is given to the patient and passes through the body widely, thereby reaching the site(s) of disease. Local administration (e.g., subcutaneous injection) may be accomplished by administration to the cell, tissue, organ, and/or organ system, which encompasses and/or is affected by the disease, and/or where the disease signs and/or symptoms are active or are likely to occur (e.g., swollen joint). Administration can be topical with a local effect, composition is applied directly where its action is desired (e.g., joint). Further, administration of a composition comprising an effective amount of an anti-IL-6 antibody selected from the group consisting of Abl- Ab36 or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, may be subcutaneous. [0395] For each of the recited embodiments, the compounds can be administered by a variety of dosage forms as known in the art. Any biologically-acceptable dosage form known to persons of ordinary skill in the art, and combinations thereof, are contemplated. Examples of such dosage forms include, without limitation, chewable tablets, quick dissolve tablets, effervescent tablets, reconstitutable powders, elixirs, liquids, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, tablets, multi-layer tablets, bi-layer tablets, capsules, soft gelatin capsules, hard gelatin caplets, lozenges, chewable 111 WO intradermal), infusions, and combinations thereof.

[0398] In further embodiments, the present subject technology provides kits including at least one container comprising pharmaceutical dosage units comprising an effective amount of at least one antibody and fragments thereof of the present subject technology. Kits may include instructions, directions, labels, marketing information, warnings, or information pamphlets. Dosages [0399] The amount of anti-IL-6 antibodies in a therapeutic composition according to any embodiments of this subject technology may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, gender, weight, patient history, risk factors, predisposition to disease, administration route, pre\u00ad existing treatment regime (e.g., possible interactions with other medications), and weight of the individual. Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time, or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of therapeutic situation. [0400] It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the mammalian subjects to be treated; each unit containing 112 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 a predetermined quantity of antibodies, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the subject technology are dictated by and directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the antibodies, and fragments thereof, and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an antibodies, and fragments thereof, for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals. In therapeutic use for treatment of conditions in mammals (e.g., humans) for which the antibodies and fragments thereof of the present subject technology or an appropriate pharmaceutical composition thereof are effective, the antibodies and fragments thereof of the present subject technology may be administered in an effective amount. The dosages as suitable for this subject technology may be a composition, a pharmaceutical composition or any other compositions described herein. [0401] The dosage may be administered as a single dose, a double dose, a triple dose, a quadruple dose, and/or a quintuple dose. The dosages may be administered singularly, simultaneously, and sequentially. For example, two doses may be administered on the same day followed by subsequent two doses four weeks later. [0402] The dosage form may be any form of release known to persons of ordinary skill in the art. The compositions of the present subject technology may be formulated to provide immediate release of the active ingredient or sustained or controlled release of the active ingredient. In a sustained release or controlled release preparation, release of the active ingredient may occur at a rate such that blood levels are maintained within a therapeutic range but below toxic levels over an extended period of time (e.g., 4 to 24 hours). The preferred dosage forms include immediate release, extended release, pulse release, variable release, controlled release, timed release, sustained release, delayed release, long acting, and combinations thereof, and are known in the art. [0403] It will be appreciated that the pharmacological activity of the compositions may be monitored using standard pharmacological models that are known in the art. Furthermore, it will be appreciated that the compositions comprising an anti-IL-6 antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof may be incorporated or encapsulated in a suitable polymer matrix or membrane for site- specific delivery, or may be functionalized with specific targeting agents capable of effecting site specific delivery. These techniques, as well as other drug delivery techniques are well known in the art. Determination of optimal dosages for a particular situation is within the capabilities of those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Grennaro (2005) [Ed.] Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy [21s t Ed.] [0404] In another embodiment of the subject technology, the anti-IL-6 antibodies described herein, or IL-6 binding fragments or variants thereof, as well as combinations of said antibody fragments or variants, are administered to a subject in a pharmaceutical formulation. 113 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 [0405] A \"pharmaceutical composition\" refers to a chemical or biological composition suitable for administration to a mammal. Such compositions may be specifically formulated for administration via at least one of a number of routes, including but not sublingual, transdermal, and transmucosal. In addition, administration can occur by means of injection, powder, liquid, gel, drops, or other means of administration. Further, a pharmaceutical composition comprising an anti-IL-6 antibody described herein (e.g., ALD518) may be administered subcutaneously. [0406] In one embodiment of the subject technology, the anti-IL-6 antibodies described herein, or IL-6 binding fragments or variants thereof, as well as combinations of said antibody fragments or variants, may be optionally administered in combination with at least one active agent. Such active agents include analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, antibiotic, antiviral, and anti-cytokine agents. Active agents include reactive against any of the foregoing, and antibodies reactive against any of their receptors. Active agents also include 2- Arylpropionic acids, and limited to abacavir, aciclovir, acyclovir, adefovir, amantadine, amprenavir, combination of these active agents is also contemplated. [0407] A \"pharmaceutical excipient\" or a \"pharmaceutically acceptable excipient\" is a carrier, usually a liquid, in which an active therapeutic agent is formulated. In one embodiment of the subject technology, the active therapeutic agent is a humanized antibody described herein, or at least one fragments or variants thereof. The excipient generally does not provide any pharmacological activity to the formulation, though it may provide chemical and/or biological stability, and release characteristics. Exemplary formulations can be found, for example, in Grennaro (2005) [Ed.] Remington: The Science and Practice of As used herein \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" or includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents that are physiologically compatible. In one embodiment, the carrier is suitable for parenteral administration. Alternatively, the carrier can be suitable for intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, or sublingual administration. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers 115 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the pharmaceutical compositions of the subject technology is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions. [0409] Pharmaceutical compositions typically must be sterile and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The subject technology contemplates that the pharmaceutical composition is present in lyophilized form. The composition may be formulated as a solution, microemulsion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. The carrier may be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol), and suitable mixtures thereof. The subject technology further contemplates the inclusion of a stabilizer in the pharmaceutical composition. [0410] The antibodies and fragments thereof, of the present subject technology thereof may be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions of various dosage forms. For example, the antibody may be ALD518, a humanized anti-interleukin-6 (anti-IL-6) monoclonal in the yeast Pichiapastoris. ALD518 may be supplied as a pH 6.0 frozen injection in single-use vials (80 mg or 160 mg ) for intravenous administration. Examplary non-active excipients include but are not limited to histidine (e.g., 25 mM) and sorbitol (e.g., 250 mM). For example, a 160 mg formulation may comprise as non-active excipients, 25 mM histidine, 250 mM sorbitol, and 0.015% polysorbate 80. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of the subject technology, at least one anti-IL-6 antibodies or binding fragments thereof, as the active ingredient may be intimately mixed with appropriate carriers and additives according to techniques well known to those skilled in the art of pharmaceutical formulations. See Grennaro (2005) [Ed.] Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy [21 stEd.] For example, the antibodies described herein may be formulated in phosphate buffered saline pH 7.2 and supplied as a 5.0 mg/mL clear colorless liquid solution. [0411] Similarly, compositions for liquid preparations include solutions, emulsions, dispersions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs, with suitable carriers and additives including but not limited to water, alcohols, oils, glycols, preservatives, flavoring agents, coloring agents, and suspending agents. Typical preparations for parenteral administration comprise the active ingredient with a carrier such as sterile water or parenterally acceptable oil including but not limited to polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, lecithin, arachis oil or sesame oil, with other additives for aiding solubility or preservation may also be included. In the case of a solution, it may be lyophilized to a powder and then reconstituted immediately prior to use. For dispersions and suspensions, appropriate carriers and additives include aqueous gums, celluloses, silicates, or oils. 116 WO 2015/054293 For each of the recited embodiments, the anti-IL-6 antibodies or binding fragments thereof, may be administered by a variety of dosage forms. Any biologically-acceptable dosage form known to persons of ordinaiy skill in the art, and combinations thereof, are contemplated. Examples of such dosage forms include, without limitation, reconstitutable powders, elixirs, liquids, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, powders, granules, particles, dispersible granules, cachets, inhalants, aerosol intravenous, and intradermal), infusions, and combinations thereof. [0413] In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, e.g., sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions may be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, e.g., monostearate salts and gelatin. Moreover, the compounds described herein may be formulated in a time release formulation, e.g. in a composition that includes a slow release polymer. The anti-IL-6 antibodies may be prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid release, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers may be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, polylactic acid and polylactic, polyglycolic copolymers (PLG). Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are known to those skilled in the art.

In another embodiment of the subject technology that may be used to subcutaneously administer antibodies of the subject technology, including Ab I, for psoriatic arthritis indications, the administration formulation comprises, or alternatively consists of, about 20 or 100 mg/mL of antibody, about 5 mM Histidine base, about 5 mM Histidine HCl to make 117 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 final pH 6, 250 to 280 mM sorbitol (or sorbitol in combination with sucrose), and 0.015% (w/w) Polysorbate 80, said formulation having a nitrogen headspace in the shipping vials. [0417] Pharmaceutical compositions typically must be sterile and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The subject technology contemplates that the pharmaceutical composition is present in lyophilized form. The composition can be formulated as a solution, microemulsion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol), and suitable mixtures thereof. The subject technology further contemplates the inclusion of a stabilizer in the pharmaceutical composition. [0418] In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, monostearate salts and gelatin. Moreover, the alkaline polypeptide can be formulated in a time release formulation, for example in a composition which includes a slow release polymer. The active compounds can be prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid release, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, polylactic acid and polylactic, polyglycolic copolymers (PLG). Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are known to those skilled in the art.

[0430] The following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how to make and use the subject technology, and are not intended to limit the scope of what is regarded as the subject technology. Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to the numbers used (e.g. amounts, temperature, concentrations) but some experimental errors and deviations should be allowed for. Unless otherwise indicated, parts are 119 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 parts by weight, molecular weight is average molecular weight, temperature is in degrees centigrade; and pressure is at or near atmospheric. E X A M P L E S [0431] In the following examples, the term \"A bl\" refers to an antibody comprising the light chain sequence of SEQ ID NO: 702 and the heavy chain sequence of SEQ ID NO: 704, except where the context indicates otherwise. The laboratory designation \"A bl\" also encompasses an anti-IL-6 antibody also known as \"clazakizumab,\" \"ALD518\" and \"BMS-945429\" comprising the light chain sequence of SEQ ID NO: 19 and the heavy chain sequence of SEQ ID NO: 20. E x a m p le I P r o d u c tio n o f E n r ic h e d A n tig e n -S p e c ific B C e ll A n tib o d y C u ltu r e [0432] Panels of antibodies are derived by immunizing traditional antibody host animals to exploit the native immune response to a target antigen of interest. Typically, the host used for immunization is a rabbit or other host that produces antibodies using a similar maturation process and provides for a population of antigen-specific B cells producing antibodies of comparable diversity, e.g., epitopic diversity. The initial antigen immunization can be conducted using complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), and the subsequent boosts effected with incomplete adjuvant. At about 50-60 days after immunization, preferably at day 55, antibody titers are tested, and the Antibody Selection (ABS) process is initiated if appropriate titers are established. The two key criteria for ABS initiation are potent antigen recognition and function-modifying activity in the polyclonal sera. [0433] At the time positive antibody titers are established, animals are sacrificed and B cell sources isolated. These sources include: the spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Single cell suspensions are generated, and the cell suspensions are washed to make them compatible for low temperature long term storage. The cells are then typically frozen. [0434] To initiate the antibody identification process, a small fraction of the frozen cell suspensions are thawed, washed, and placed in tissue culture media. These suspensions are then mixed with a biotinylated form of the antigen that was used to generate the animal immune response, and antigen- specific cells are recovered using the Miltenyi magnetic bead cell selection methodology. Specific enrichment is conducted using streptavidin beads. The enriched population is recovered and progressed in the next phase of specific B cell isolation. E x a m p le 2 P r o d u c tio n o f C lo n a l, A n tig e n -S p e c ific B C e ll- C o n ta in in g C u ltu r e [0435] Enriched B cells produced according to Example I are then plated at varying cell densities per well in a 96 well microtiter plate. Generally, this is at 50, 100, 250, or 500 cells per well with 10 plates per group. The media is supplemented with 4% activated rabbit T cell conditioned media along with 50K frozen irradiated EL4B feeder cells. These cultures are left undisturbed for 5-7 days at 120 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 which time supernatant-containing secreted antibody is collected and evaluated for target properties in a separate assay setting. The remaining supernatant is left intact, and the plate is frozen at -70\u00b0C. Under these conditions, the culture process typically results in wells containing a mixed cell population that comprises a clonal population of antigen-specific B cells, i.e., a single well will only contain a single monoclonal antibody specific to the desired antigen. E x a m p le 3 S c r e e n in g o f A n tib o d y S u p e r n a ta n ts f o r M o n o c lo n a l A n tib o d y o f D e s ire d S p e c ific ity a n d / o r F u n c tio n a l P r o p e r tie s [0436] Antibody-containing supernatants derived from the well containing a clonal antigen-specific B cell population produced according to Example 2 are initially screened for antigen recognition using ELlSA methods. This includes selective antigen immobilization (e.g., biotinylated antigen capture by streptavidin coated plate), non-specific antigen plate coating, or alternatively, through an antigen build-up strategy (e.g., selective antigen capture followed by binding partner addition to generate a heteromeric protein-antigen complex). Antigen-positive well supernatants are then optionally tested in a function-modifying assay that is strictly dependant on the ligand. One such example is an in vitro protein-protein interaction assay that recreates the natural interaction of the antigen ligand with recombinant receptor protein. Alternatively, a cell-based response that is ligand dependent and easily monitored (e.g., proliferation response) is utilized. Supernatant that displays significant antigen recognition and potency is deemed a positive well. Cells derived from the original positive well are then transitioned to the antibody recovery phase. E x a m p le 4 R e c o v e ry o f S in g le , A n tib o d y - P r o d u c in g B C e ll o f D e s ire d A n tig e n S p e c ific ity [0437] Cells are isolated from a well that contains a clonal population of antigen-specific B cells (produced according to Example 2 or 3), which secrete a single antibody sequence. The isolated cells are then assayed to isolate a single, antibody-secreting cell. Dynal\u00ae (magnetic beads) streptavidin beads are coated with biotinylated target antigen under buffered medium to prepare antigen- containing microbeads compatible with cell viability. Next antigen-loaded beads, antibody-producing cells from the isothiocyanate (FlTC)-Iabeled anti-host H&L IgG antibody (as noted, the host can be any mammalian host, e.g., rabbit, mouse, rat) are incubated together at 37\u00b0C. This mixture is then re-pipetted in aliquots onto a glass slide such that each aliquot has on average a single, antibody-producing B-cell. The antigen-specific, antibody-secreting cells are then detected through fluorescence microscopy. Secreted antibody is locally concentrated onto the adjacent beads due to the bound antigen and provides localization information based on the strong fluorescent signal. Antibody-secreting cells are identified via FITC detection of antibody-antigen complexes formed adjacent to the secreting cell. The single cell found in the center of this complex is then recovered using a micromanipulator. The cell is snap-frozen in an EppendorfPCR tube for storage at -80\u00b0C until antibody sequence recovery is initiated. 121 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 E x a m p le 5 Is o la tio n o f A n tib o d y S e q u e n c e s F r o m A n tig e n -S p e c ific B C e ll [0438] Antibody sequences are recovered using a combined RT-PCR based method from a single isolated B-cell produced according to Example 4 or an antigenic specific B cell isolated from the clonal B cell population obtained according to Example 2. Primers are designed to anneal in conserved and constant regions of the target immunoglobulin genes (heavy and light), such as rabbit immunoglobulin sequences, and a two-step nested PCR recovery step is used to obtain the antibody sequence. Amplicons from each well are analyzed for recovery and size integrity. The resulting fragments are then digested with AluI to fingerprint the sequence clonality. Identical sequences display a common fragmentation pattern in their electrophoretic analysis. Significantly, this common fragmentation pattern which proves cell clonality is generally observed even in the wells originally plated up to 1000 cells/well. The original heavy and light chain amplicon fragments are then restriction enzyme digested with HindIII and XhoI or HindIII and BsiWI to prepare the respective pieces of DNA for cloning. The resulting digestions are then ligated into an expression vector and transformed into bacteria for plasmid propagation and production. Colonies are selected for sequence characterization. E x a m p le 6 R e c o m b in a n t P r o d u c tio n o f M o n o c lo n a l A n tib o d y o f D e s ire d A n tig e n S p e c ific ity a n d /o r F u n c tio n a l P r o p e r tie s [0439] Correct full-length antibody sequences for each well containing a single monoclonal antibody is established and miniprep DNA is prepared using Qiagen solid-phase methodology. This DNA is then used to transfect mammalian cells to produce recombinant full-length antibody. Crude antibody product is tested for antigen recognition and functional properties to confirm the original characteristics are found in the recombinant antibody protein. Where appropriate, large-scale transient mammalian transfections are completed, and antibody is purified through Protein A affinity chromatography. Kd is assessed using standard methods (e.g., Biacore\u00ae) as well as IC 50 in a potency assay. E x a m p le 7 P r e p a r a ti o n o f A n tib o d ie s t h a t B in d H u m a n IL -6 [0440] By using the antibody selection protocol described herein, one can generate an extensive panel of antibodies. The antibodies have high affinity towards IL - 6 (single to double digit pM Kd) and demonstrate potent antagonism of IL - 6 in multiple cell-based screening systems (Tl 165 and HepG2). Furthermore, the collection of antibodies displays distinct modes of antagonism toward IL- 6-driven processes. Immunization Strategy [0441] Rabbits were immunized with huIL - 6 (R&R). Immunization consisted of a first subcutaneous (sc) injection of 100 pg in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) (Sigma) followed by two 122 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 boosts, two weeks apart, of 50 pg each in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) (Sigma). Animals were bled on day 55, and serum titers were determined by ELISA (antigen recognition) and by non\u00ad radioactive proliferation assay (Promega) using the Tl 165 cell line. Antibody Selection Titer Assessment [0442] Antigen recognition was determined by coating Immulon 4 plates (Thermo) with I pg/mL of huIL-6 (50 pL/well) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Hyclone) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. On the day of the assay, plates were washed 3 times with PBS /Tween 20 (PBST tablets, Calbiochem). Plates were then blocked with 200 pL/wel I of 0.5% fish skin gelatin (FSG, Sigma) in PBS for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Blocking solution was removed, and plates were blotted. Serum samples were made (bleeds and pre\u00ad bleeds) at a starting dilution of 1:100 (all dilutions were made in FSG 50 pL/well) followed by 1:10 dilutions across the plate (column 12 was left blank for background control). Plates were incubated for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Plates were washed 3 times with PBS/Tween 20. Goat anti-rabbit Fc-HRP (Pierce) diluted 1:5000 was added to all wells (50 pL/well), and plates were incubated for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Plates were washed as described above. 50 pL/well of TMB-Stable stop (Fitzgerald Industries) was added to plates, and color was allowed to develop, generally for 3 to 5 minutes. The development reaction was stopped with 50 pL/well 0.5 M HCl. Plates were read at 450 nm. Optical density (OD) versus dilution was plotted using Graph Pad Prizm software, and titers were determined. Functional Titer Assessment [0443] The functional activity of the samples was determined by a Tl 165 proliferation assay. Tl 165 cells were routinely maintained in modified RPMI (Hyclone) supplemented with (all Hyclone), 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and 10 ng/mL of huIL-6 (R&D). On the day of the assay, cell viability was determined by trypan blue (Invitrogen), and cells were seeded at a fixed density of 20,000 cells/well. Prior to seeding, cells were washed twice in the medium described above without human-IL-6 (by centrifuging at 13000 rpm for 5 minutes and discarding the supernatant). After the last wash, cells were resuspended in the same medium used for washing in a volume equivalent to 50 pL/well. Cells were set aside at room temperature. [0444] In a round-bottom, 96-well plate (Costar), serum samples were added starting at 1:100, followed by a 1:10 dilution across the plate (columns 2 to 10) at 30 pL/well in replicates of 5 (rows B to F: dilution made in the medium described above with no huIL-6). Column 11 was medium only for IL-6 control. 30 pL/well of huIL-6 at 4x concentration of the final EC50 (concentration previously determined) were added to all wells (huIL-6 was diluted in the medium described above). Wells were incubated for I hour at 37\u00b0C to allow antibody binding to occur. After I hour, 50 pL/well of antibody- antigen (Ab-Ag) complex were transferred to a flat-bottom, 96-well plate (Costar) following the plate map format laid out in the round-bottom plate. On Row G, 50 pL/well of medium were added to all 123 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 wells (columns 2 to 11) for background control. 50 pL/we 1 1 of the cell suspension set aside were added to all wells (columns 2 to 11, rows B to G). On Columns I and 12 and on rows A and H, 200 pL/well of medium was added to prevent evaporation of test wells and to minimize edge effect. Plates were incubated for 72 hours at 37\u00b0C in 4% CO2. At 72 hours, 20 pL/we1 1 of CellTiter96 (Promega) reagents was added to all test wells per manufacturer protocol, and plates were incubated for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C. At 2 h, plates were gently mixed on an orbital shaker to disperse cells and to allow homogeneity in the test wells. Plates were read at 490 nm wavelength. Optical density (OD) versus dilution was plotted using Graph Pad Prizm software, and functional titer was determined. A positive assay control plate was conducted as described above using MAB2061 (R&D Systems) at a starting concentration of I pg/mL (final concentration) followed by 1:3 dilutions across the plate. Tissue Harvesting [0445] Once acceptable titers were established, the rabbit(s) were sacrificed. Spleen, lymph nodes, and whole blood were harvested and processed as follows: [0446] Spleen and lymph nodes were processed into a single cell suspension by disassociating the tissue and pushing through sterile wire mesh at 70 pm (Fisher) with a plunger of a 20 cc syringe. Cells were collected in the modified RPMI medium described above without huIL-6, but with low glucose. Cells were washed twice by centrifugation. After the last wash, cell density was determined by trypan blue. Cells were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes; the supernatant was discarded. Cells were resuspended in the appropriate volume of 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, in FBS (Hyclone) and mL/vial. Vials were then stored at -70 0C for 24 h prior to being placed in a liquid nitrogen (LN2) tank for long-term storage. [0447] Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by mixing whole blood with equal parts of the low glucose medium described above without FBS. 35 mL of the whole blood mixture was carefully layered onto 8 mL of Lympholyte Rabbit (Cedarlane) into a 45 mL conical tube (Corning) and centrifuged 30 minutes at 2500 rpm at room temperature without brakes. After centrifugation, the PBMC layers were carefully removed using a glass Pasteur pipette (VWR), combined, and placed into a clean 50 mL vial. Cells were washed twice with the modified medium described above by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes at room temperature, and cell density was determined by trypan blue staining. After the last wash, cells were resuspended in an appropriate volume of 10% DMSO/FBS medium and frozen as described herein. B cell culture [0448] On the day of setting up B cell culture, PBMC, splenocyte, or lymph node vials were thawed for use. Vials were removed from LN2 tank and placed in a 37\u00b0C water bath until thawed. Contents of vials were transferred into 15 mL conical centrifuge tube (Coming) and 10 mL of modified RPMI described above was slowly added to the tube. Cells were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1.5K rpm, and the supernatant was discarded. Cells were resuspended in 10 mL of fresh media. 124 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 Cell density and viability was determined by trypan blue. Cells were washed again and resuspended at 1E07 cells/80 pL medium. Biotinylated huIL-6 (B huIL-6) was added to the cell suspension at the final concentration of 3 pg/mL and incubated for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Unbound B huIL-6 was removed with two 10 mL washes of phosphate-buffered (PBF): Ca/Mg free PBS cells were resuspended at 1E07 cells/80 pL PBF. 20 pL of MACS\u00ae streptavidin beads (Milteni)/10E7 cells were added to the cell suspension. Cells were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 15 minutes. Cells were washed once with 2 mL of PBF/10E7 cells. After washing, the cells were resuspended at 1E08 cells/500 pL of PBF and set aside. A MACS\u00ae MS column (Milteni) was pre-rinsed with 500 mL of PBF on a magnetic stand (Milteni). Cell suspension was applied to the column through a pre-filter, and unbound fraction was collected. The column was washed with 1.5 mL of PBF buffer. The column was removed from the magnet stand and placed onto a clean, sterile 5 mL Polypropylene Falcon tube. I mL of PBF buffer was added to the top of the column, and positive selected cells were collected. The yield and viability of positive and negative cell fraction was determined by trypan blue staining. Positive selection yielded an average of 1% of the starting cell concentration. [0449] A pilot cell screen was established to provide information on seeding levels for the culture. Three 10-plate groups (a total of 30 plates) were seeded at 50, 100, and 200 enriched B cells/well. In addition, each well contained 50K cells/well of irradiated EL-4.B5 cells (5,000 Rads) and an appropriate level of T cell supernatant (ranging from 1-5% depending on preparation) in high glucose modified RPMI medium at a final volume of 250 L/well. Cultures were incubated for 5 to 7 days at 37 0C in 4% CO2 . Identification of Selective Antibody Secreting B Cells [0450] Cultures were tested for antigen recognition and functional activity between days 5 and 7. Antigen Recognition Screening [0451] The ELISA format used is as described above except 50 pL of supernatant from the B cell cultures (BCC) wells (all 30 plates) was used as the source of the antibody. The conditioned medium was transferred to antigen-coated plates. After positive wells were identified, the supernatant was removed and transferred to a 96-well master plate(s). The original culture plates were then frozen by removing all the supernatant except 40 pL/well and adding 60 pL/well of 16% DMSO in FBS. Plates were wrapped in paper towels to slow freezing and placed at -70 \u00b0C. Functional Activity Screening [0452] Master plates were then screened for functional activity in the Tl 165 proliferation assay as described before, except row B was media only for background control, row C was media + IL-6 for positive proliferation control, and rows D-G and columns 2-11 were the wells from the BCC (50 pL/well, single points). 40 pL of IL-6 was added to all wells except the media row at 2.5 times the 125 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 EC50 concentration determined for the assay. After I h incubation, the Ab/Ag complex was transferred to a tissue culture (TC) treated, 96-well, flat-bottom plate. 20 pL of cell suspension in modified RPMl medium without huIL-6 (Tl 165 at 20,000 cells/well) was added to all wells (100 pL final volume per well). Background was subtracted, and observed OD values were transformed into % of inhibition. B cell recovery [0453] Plates containing wells of interest were removed from -70 \u00b0C, and the cells from each well were recovered with 5-200 pL washes of medium/well. The washes were pooled in a 1.5 mL sterile centrifuge tube, and cells were pelleted for 2 minutes at 1500 rpm. [0454] The tube was inverted, the spin repeated, and the supernatant carefully removed. Cells were resuspended in 100 pL/tube of 100 L biotinylated IL-6 coated streptavidin anti-rabbit H&L IgG-FITC diluted 1:100 in medium was added to the cell suspension. [0455] 20 pL of cell/beads/FITC suspension was removed, and 5 pL droplets were prepared on a glass slide (Corning) previously treated with Sigmacote (Sigma), 35 to 40 droplets/slide. An impermeable barrier of paraffin oil (JT Baker) was added to submerge the droplets, and the slide was incubated for 90 minutes at 37\u00b0C, 4% CO2 in the dark. [0456] Specific B cells that produce antibody can be identified by the fluorescent ring around them due to antibody secretion, recognition of the bead-associated biotinylated antigen, and subsequent detection by the fluorescent-IgG detection reagent. Once a cell of interest was identified, the cell in the center of the fluorescent ring was recovered via a micromanipulator (Eppendorf). The single cell synthesizing and exporting the antibody was transferred into a 250 L microcentrifuge tube and placed in dry ice. After recovering all cells of interest, these were transferred to -70\u00b0C for long-term storage. E x a m p le 8 Y e a s t C e ll E x p re s s io n [0457] Antibody genes: Genes were cloned and constructed that directed the synthesis of a chimeric humanized rabbit monoclonal antibody. [0458] Expression vector: The vector contains the following functional components: I) a mutant ColEl origin of replication, which facilitates the replication of the plasmid vector in cells of the bacterium Escherichia coir, 2) a bacterial Sh ble gene, which confers resistance to the antibiotic Zeocin\u00ae (phleomycin) and serves as the selectable marker for transformations of both E. coli and P. pastoris\u00b7, 3) an expression cassette composed of the glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase gene ( GAP gene) promoter, fused to sequences encoding the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha mating factor pre pro secretion leader sequence, followed by sequences encoding a P. pastoris transcriptional termination signal from the P. pastoris alcohol oxidase I gene ( AO Xl ). The Zeocin\u00ae (phleomycin) resistance 126 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 marker gene provides a means of enrichment for strains that contain multiple integrated copies of an expression vector in a strain by selecting for transformants that are resistant to higher levels of Zeocin\u00ae (phleomycin). [0459] P. pastoris strains: P. pastoris strains metl, Iys3, ura3 and adel may be used. Although any two complementing sets of auxotrophic strains could be used for the construction and maintenance of diploid strains, these two strains are especially suited for this method for two reasons. First, they grow more slowly than diploid strains that are the result of their mating or fusion. Thus, if a small number of haploid adel or ura3 cells remain present in a culture or arise through meiosis or other mechanism, the diploid strain should outgrow them in culture. [0460] The second is that it is easy to monitor the sexual state of these strains since diploid Ade+ colonies arising from their mating are a normal white or cream color, whereas cells of any strains that are haploid adel mutants will form a colony with a distinct pink color. In addition, any strains that are haploid ura3 mutants are resistant to the drug 5-fluoro-orotic acid (FOA) and can be sensitively identified by plating samples of a culture on minimal medium + uracil plates with FOA. On these plates, only uracil-requiring ura3 mutant (presumably haploid) strains can grow and form colonies. Thus, with haploid parent strains marked with adel and ura3, one can readily monitor the sexual state of the resulting antibody-producing diploid strains (haploid versus diploid). Methods [0461] Construction o f pGAPZ-alpha expression vectors for transcription o f light and heavy chain antibody genes. The humanized light and heavy chain fragments were cloned into the pGAPZ expression vectors through a PCR directed process. The recovered humanized constructs were subjected to amplification under standard KOD polymerase (Novagen) kit conditions ((I) 94 0C, 2 minutes; (2) 94 0C, 30 seconds (3) 55 \u00b0C, 30 seconds; (4) 72 \u00b0C, 30 seconds-cycling through steps 2- 4 for 35 times; (5) 72 0C 2 minutes) employing the following primers (I) light chain forward AGCGCTTATTCCGCTATCCAGATGACCCAGTC-the AfeI site is single underlined (SEQ ID NO: 729).

[0462] Variable light chain reverse primer. BsiWI site is underlined, followed by the reverse complement for the 3' end of the variable light chain. Upon restriction enzyme digest with AfeI and BsiWI this enable insertion in-frame with the pGAPZ vector using the human HAS leader sequence in frame with the human kapp light chain constant region for export. (2) A similar strategy is performed for the heavy chain. The forward primer employed is AGCGCTTATTCCGAGGTGCAGCTGGTGGAGTC (SEQ ID NO: 731). The AfeI site is single underlined. The end of the HSA signal sequence is double underlined, followed by the sequence for the mature variable heavy chain (not underlined). The reverse heavy chain primer is 127 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 CTCGAGACGGTGACGAGGGT (SEQ ID NO: 732). The XhoI site is underlined, followed by the reverse complement for the 3' end of the variable heavy chain. This enables cloning of the heavy chain in-frame with IgG- CH1-CH2-CH3 region previous inserted within pGAPZ using a comparable directional cloning strategy. [0463] Transformation o f expression vectors into haploid adel ura3, met I and lys3 host strains o f P. pastoris. AU methods used for transformation of haploid P. pastoris strains and genetic manipulation of the P. pastoris sexual cycle are as described in Higgins, D. R., and Cregg, J. M., Eds. 1998. Pichia Protocols. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ. [0464] Prior to transformation, each expression vector is linearized within the GAP promoter sequences with AvrII to direct the integration of the vectors into the GAP promoter locus of the P. pastoris genome. Samples of each vector are then individually transformed into electrocompetent cultures of the adel, ura3, metl and Iys3 strains by electroporation and successful transformants are selected on YPD Zeocin\u00ae (phleomycin) plates by their resistance to this antibiotic. Resulting colonies are selected, streaked for single colonies on YPD Zeocin\u00ae (phleomycin) plates and then examined for the presence of the antibody gene insert by a PCR assay on genomic DNA extracted from each strain for the proper antibody gene insert and/or by the ability of each strain to synthesize an antibody chain by a colony lifit/immunoblot method. Wung, et al. (1996) Biotechniques 21: 808- 812. Haploid adel, metl and lys3 strains expressing one of the three heavy chain constructs are collected for diploid constructions along with haploid ura3 strain expressing light chain gene. The haploid expressing heavy chain genes are mated with the appropriate light chain haploid ura3 to generate diploid secreting protein. [0465] Mating of haploid strains synthesizing a single antibody chain and selection of diploid derivatives synthesizing tetrameric functional antibodies. To mate P. pastoris haploid strains, each adel (or metl or lys3) heavy chain producing strain to be crossed is streaked across a rich YPD plate and the ura3 light chain producing strain is streaked across a second YPD plate (-10 streaks per plate). After one or two days incubation at 30\u00b0C, cells from one plate containing heavy chain strains and one plate containing ura3 light chain strains are transferred to a sterile velvet cloth on a replica- plating block in a cross hatched pattern so that each heavy chain strain contain a patch of cells mixed with each light chain strain. The cross-streaked replica plated cells are then transferred to a mating plate and incubated at 25\u00b0C to stimulate the initiation of mating between strains. After two days, the cells on the mating plates are transferred again to a sterile velvet on a replica-plating block and then transferred to minimal medium plates. These plates are incubated at 3O 0C for three days to allow for the selective growth of colonies of prototrophic diploid strains. Colonies that arose are picked and streaked onto a second minimal medium plate to single colony isolate and purify each diploid strain. The resulting diploid cell lines are then examined for antibody production. 128 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 [0466] Putative diploid strains are tested to demonstrate that they are diploid and contain both expression vectors for antibody production. For diploidy, samples of a strain are spread on mating plates to stimulate them to go through meiosis and form spores. Haploid spore products are collected and tested for phenotype. If a significant percentage of the resulting spore products are single or double auxotrophs it may be concluded that the original strain must have been diploid. Diploid strains are examined for the presence of both antibody genes by extracting genomic DNA from each and utilizing this DNA in PCR reactions specific for each gene. [0467] Fusion of haploid strains synthesizing a single antibody chain and selection of diploid derivatives synthesizing tetrameric functional antibodies. As an alternative to the mating procedure described above, individual cultures of single-chain antibody producing haploid ade I and ura3 strains are spheroplasted and their resulting spheroplasts fused using polyethylene glycol/CaCl 2. The fused haploid strains are then embedded in agar containing I M sorbitol and minimal medium to allow diploid strains to regenerate their cell wall and grow into visible colonies. Resulting colonies are picked from the agar, streaked onto a minimal medium plate, and the plates are incubated for two days at 30\u00b0C to generate colonies from single cells of diploid cell lines. The resulting putative diploid cell lines are then examined for diploidy and antibody production as described above. [0468] Purification and analysis of antibodies. A diploid strain for the production of full length antibody is derived through the mating of metl light chain and lys3 heavy chain using the methods described above. Culture media from shake-flask or fermenter cultures of diploid P. pastoris expression strains are collected and examined for the presence of antibody protein via SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies directed against heavy and light chains of human IgG, or specifically against the heavy chain of IgG. [0469] To purify the yeast secreted antibodies, clarified media from antibody producing cultures are passed through a protein A column and after washing with 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, binding buffer, protein A bound protein is eluted using 0.1 M glycine HCl buffer, pH 3.0. Fractions containing the most total protein are examined by Coomassie blue strained SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for antibody protein. Antibody is characterized using the ELISA described above for IL-6 recognition. [0470] Assay for antibody activity. The recombinant yeast-derived humanized antibody is evaluated for functional activity through the IL-6 driven Tl 165 cell proliferation assay and IL-6 stimulated HepG2 haptoglobin assay described above. Example 9 Acute Phase Response Neutralization by Intravenous Administration of Anti-IL - 6 Antibody Abl [0471] Human IL-6 can provoke an acute phase response in rats, and one of the major acute phase proteins that is stimulated in the rat is alpha -2 macroglobulin (A2M). A study was designed to assess the dose of antibody Abl required to ablate the A2M response to a single subcutaneous injection of 129 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 100 g of human IL-6 given one hour after different doses (0.03, 0.1, 0.3, I, and 3 mg/kg) of antibody Abl administered intravenously (n=10 rats/dose level) or polyclonal human IgGl as the control (n=10 rats). Plasma was recovered and the A2M was quantitated via a commercial sandwich ELISA kit (ICL Inc., Newberg OR; cat. no.- E-25A2M). The endpoint was the difference in the plasma concentration of A2M at the 24 hour time point (post-AbI). [0472] The ID50 for antibody Abl was 0.1 mg/kg with complete suppression of the A2M response at the 0.3 mg/kg. This demonstrates that the IL-6 may be neutralized in vivo by anti-IL-6 antibodies described herein. Example 10 Pharmacokinetic of Abl in Non-human Primates [0473] Antibody Abl was dosed in a single bolus infusion to a single male and single female cynomolgus monkey in phosphate buffered saline. Plasma samples were removed at fixed time intervals and the level of antibody Abl was quantitated through of the use of an antigen capture ELISA assay. Biotinylated IL-6 (50 of 3 pg/mL) was captured on Streptavidin coated 96 well microtiter plates. The plates were washed and blocked with 0.5% Fish skin gelatin. Appropriately diluted plasma samples were added and incubated for I hour at room temperature. The supernatants removed and an anti-hFc-HRP conjugated secondary antibody applied and left at room temperature. [0474] The plates were then aspirated and TMB added to visualize the amount of antibody. The specific levels were then determined through the use of a standard curve. A second dose of antibody Abl was administered at day 35 to the same two cynomolgus monkeys and the experiment replicated using an identical sampling plan. The resulting concentrations are then plot vs. time as show in Fig. 6. [0475] This humanized full length aglycosylated antibody expressed and purified Pichiapastoris displays comparable characteristics to mammalian expressed protein. In addition, multiple doses of this product display reproducible half-lives inferring that this production platform does not generate products that display enhanced immunogenicity. Example 11 Octet Mechanistic Characterization of Antibody Proteins [0476] IL-6 signaling is dependent upon interactions between IL-6 and two receptors, IL-6R1 (CD126) and gpl30 (IL-6 signal transducer). To determine the antibody mechanism of action, mechanistic studies were performed using bio-layer interferometry with an Octet QK instrument (ForteBio; Menlo Park, CA). Studies were performed in two different configurations. In the first orientation, biotinylated IL-6 (R&D systems part product number 21338 to manufacturer's protocols) was to a streptavidin coated biosensor (ForteBio part number 18-5006). Binding is monitored as an increase in signal. 130 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 [0477] The IL-6 bound to the sensor was then incubated either with the antibody in question or diluent solution alone. The sensor was then incubated with soluble IL-6R1 (R&D systems product number 227-SR-025/CF) molecule. If the IL-6R1 molecule failed to bind, the antibody was deemed to block IL-6/IL-6R1 interactions. These complexes were incubated with gpl30 (R&D systems 228- GP-010/CF) in the presence of IL-6R1 for stability purposes. If gp 130 did not bind, it was concluded that the antibody blocked gpl30 interactions with IL-6. [0478] In the second orientation, the antibody was bound to a biosensor coated with an 18-5001). The IL-6 was bound to the immobilized antibody and the sensor was incubated with IL-6R1. If the IL-6R1 did not interact with the IL-6, then it was concluded that the IL-6 binding antibody blocked IL-6/IL-6R1 interactions. In those situations where antibody/IL-6/IL-6RI was observed, the complex was incubated with gpl30 in the presence of IL-6R1. If gpl30 did not interact, then it was concluded that the antibody blocked IL-6/gpl30 interactions. AU studies were performed in a 200 ^ final volume, at 30\u00b0C and 1000 rpm. For these studies, all proteins were diluted using ForteBio's sample diluent buffer (part number 18-5028). Results are presented in Fig. 7A-E and TABLE 5.

The form of human IL-6 utilized in this example had a sequence of 183 amino acids in length. A 57-member library of overlapping 15 amino acid peptides encompassing this sequence was commercially synthesized and covalently bound to a PepSpots nitrocellulose membrane (JPT Peptide technologies, Berlin, Germany). The sequences of the overlapping 15 amino acid peptides are in SEQ ID NOs: 590-646. Blots were prepared and probed the manufacturer's recommendations. [0480] Briefly, blots were pre-wet in methanol, rinsed in PBS, and blocked for over 2 hours in 10% non-fat milk in PBS/0.05% Tween (Blocking Solution). The Abl antibody was used at I mg/mL final dilution, and the HRP-conjugated Mouse Anti-Human-Kappa secondary antibody (Southern BioTech #9220-05) was used at a 1:5000 dilution. Antibody dilutions/incubations were performed in blocking 131 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 solution. were (GE# RPN2135) and chemiluminescent signal documented using a CCD camera (AlphaInnotec). The sequence of the form o f human IL-6 utilized to generate peptide library is set forth in SEQ ID NO: I . Example 13 Abl has high affinity for IL - 6 [0481] Surface plasmon resonance was used to measure association rate (Ka ), dissociation rate (Kd ) and dissociation constant (K0) for to IL-6 from rat, mouse, dog, human, and cynomolgus monkey at 25\u00b0C (TABLE 6). The dissociation constant for human IL-6 was 4 pM, indicating very high affinity. As expected, affinity generally decreased with phylogenetic distance from human. The dissociation constants of Abl for IL-6 of cynomolgus monkey, rat, and mouse were 31 pM, 1.4 nM, and 0.4 nM, respectively. Abl affinity for dog IL-6 below the limit of quantitation of the experiment. [0482] The high affinity of Abl for mouse, rat, and cynomolgus monkey IL-6 suggest that Abl may be used to inhibit IL-6 of these species. This hypothesis was tested using a cell proliferation assay. In brief, each species' IL-6 was used to stimulate proliferation of Tl 165 cells, and the concentration at which Abl could inhibit 50% of proliferation (IC50) was measured. Inhibition was consistent with the measured dissociation constants (TABLE 7). These results demonstrate that Abl can inhibit the native IL-6 of these species, and suggest the use of these organisms for in vitro or in vivo modeling of IL-6 inhibition by A bl. Table 6.

Dosages of I mg, 3 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg or 100 mg were administered to each individual in dosage groups containing five to six individuals. Plasma samples were removed at fixed time intervals for up to twelve weeks. Human plasma was collected via venipuncture into a vacuum collection tube containing EDTA. Plasma was separated and used to assess the circulating levels of Abl using a monoclonal antibody specific for A bl, as follows. A 96 well microtiter plate was coated overnight with the monoclonal antibody specific for Abl in IX PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C. The remaining steps were conducted at room temperature. The wells were aspirated and subsequently blocked using 0.5% Fish Skin Gelatin (FSG) (Sigma) in IX PBS for 60 minutes. Human plasma samples were then added and incubated for 60 minutes, then aspirated, then 50 L of I pg/mL biotinylated IL-6 was then added to each well and incubated for 60 minutes. The wells were aspirated, and 50 pL streptavidin- HRP (Pharmingen), diluted 1:5,000 in 0.5% FSG/PBS, was added and incubated for 45 minutes. Development was conducted using standard methods employing TMB for detection. Levels were then determined via comparison to a standard curve prepared in a comparable format. [0484] Average plasma concentration of Ab I for each dosage group versus time is shown in TABLE 8. Mean AUC and Cm a x increased linearly with dosage. For dosages of 30 mg and above, the average Abl half-life in each dosage group was between approximately 25 and 30 days. Table 8.

Each individual received a dosage of 80 mg (n=2) or 160 mg (n=3) 133 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 of Ab I. Plasma samples were drawn weekly, and the level of antibody Abl was quantitated as in Example 16. [0486] Average plasma concentration of Abl in these individuals as a function of time is shown in Fig. 8. The average Abl half-life was approximately 31 days. Example 16 Half-life of Abl [0487] Overall, the average half-life of Ab I was approximately 31 days in humans (for dosages of 10 mg and above), and approximately 15-21 days in cynomolgus monkey. The Abl half-life in humans and cynomolgus monkeys is unprecedented when compared with the half-lives of other anti- IL-6 antibodies (TABLE 9). As described above, Abl was derived from humanization of a rabbit antibody, and is produced from Pichiapastoris in an aglycosylated form. These characteristics results in an antibody with very low immunogenicity in humans. Moreover, the lack of glycosylation prevents Abl from interacting with the Fe receptor or complement. Without intent to be limited by theory, it is believed that the unexpectedly long half-life of Abl is at least partially attributable to the humanization and/or the lack of glycosylation. The particular sequence and/or structure of the antigen binding surfaces may also contribute to A bl's half-life. TABLE 9. Example 17 Abl Suppresses Serum CRP in Healthy Volunteers and in Patients with Advanced Cancer [0488] Introduction \u2014 Serum CRP concentrations have been identified as a strong prognostic indicator in patients with certain forms of cancer. For example, Hashimoto et al. performed univariate and multivariate analysis of preoperative serum CRP concentrations in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in order to identify factors affecting survival and disease recurrence. Hashimoto, et al. (2005) Cancer 103(9): 1856-1864. Patients were classified into two groups, those with serum CRP levels > 1.0 mg/dL (\"the CRP positive group\") with PCT/US2014/059543 CRP negative between preoperative serum CRP level and tumor size.\" Id. Furthermore, the authors found that \"[t]he overall survival and recurrence-free survival rates in the CRP-positive group were significantly lower compared with the rates in the CRP-negative group.\" Id. The authors concluded that the preoperative CRP level of patients is an independent and significant predictive indicator or poor prognosis and early recurrence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. [0489] Similar correlations have been identified by other investigators. For example, Karakiewicz et al. determined that serum CRP was an independent and informative predictor of renal cell carcinoma-specific mortality. Karakiewicz. et al. (2007) Cancer. 110(6):1241-1247. Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for methods and/or treatments that reduce serum C-Reactive Protein (CRP) concentrations in cancer patients, and particularly those with advanced cancers. [0490] Methods \u2014Healthy volunteers received a single I-hour intravenous (IV) infusion of either 100 mg (5 patients), 30 mg (5 patients), 10 mg (6 patients), 3 mg (6 patients) or I mg (6 patients) of the Abl monoclonal antibody, while another 14 healthy volunteers received intravenous placebo. Comparatively, 2 patients with advanced forms of colorectal cancer received a single I-hour intravenous (IV) infusion of 80 mg of the Abl monoclonal antibody. No further dosages of the Abl monoclonal antibody were administered to the test population. [0491] Patients were evaluated prior to administration of the dosage, and thereafter on a weekly basis for at least 5 weeks post dose. At the time of each evaluation, patients were screened for serum CRP concentration. [0492] Results \u2014 Healthy Volunteers [0493] As noted above, serum CRP levels are a marker of inflammation; accordingly, baseline CRP levels are typically low in healthy individuals. The low baseline CRP levels can make a further reduction in CRP levels difficult to detect. Nonetheless, a substantial reduction in serum CRP concentrations was detectable in healthy volunteers receiving all concentrations of the Abl monoclonal antibody, compared to controls (Fig. 9A). The reduction in serum CRP levels was rapid, occurring within one week of antibody administration, and prolonged, continuing at least through the final measurement was taken (8 or 12 weeks from antibody administration). [0494] Results\u2014 Cancer Patients [0495] Five advanced cancer patients (colorectal cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, or NSCLC) having elevated serum CRP levels were dosed with 80 mg or 160 mg of AbI. Serum CRP levels were greatly reduced in these patients (Fig. 9B). The reduction in serum CRP levels was rapid, with 90% of the decrease occurring within one week of Abl administration, and prolonged, continuing at least until the final measurement was taken (up to twelve weeks). In two representative individuals, the CRP levels were lowered to below the normal reference range (less than 5 - 6 mg/1) within one week. 135 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 Thus, administration of Abl to patients can cause a rapid and sustained suppression of serum CRP levels.

The authors concluded that the preoperative CRP level of patients is an independent and significant predictive indicator of poor prognosis and early recurrence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. [0497] Similar correlations have been identified by other investigators. For example, Karakiewicz et al. determined that serum CRP was an independent and informative predictor of renal cell carcinoma-specific mortality. Karakiewicz, et al. (2007) Cancer 110(6):1241-1247. Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for methods and/or treatments that reduce serum C-Reactive Protein (CRP) concentrations in cancer patients, and particularly those with advanced cancers. [0498] Methods \u2014 One-hundred twenty-four patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were divided into 4 treatment groups. Patients in one group received one I-hour intravenous (IV) infusion of either placebo (n=31), 80 mg (n=29), 160 mg (n=32), or 320 mg (n=32) ofthe Abl monoclonal antibody every 8 weeks over a 24 week duration for a total of 3 doses. CRP concentration was quantitated by a C-reactive protein antibodies (i.e. Roche CRP Tinaquant\u00ae). Briefly, about 1.0 mL of patient sample serum was collected and stored in a plastic collection tube. Sample was placed into appropriate buffer, and anti-CRP antibody coupled to latex microparticles was added to the sample to start the reaction. These anti-CRP antibodies with conjugated latex microparticles react with antigen in the sample to form an antigen/antibody complex. Following agglutination, this was measured turbidimetrically using a Roche/Hitachi Modular P analyzer. [0499] Patients were evaluated prior to administration of the dosage, and thereafter at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. At the time of each evaluation, patients were screened for serum CRP concentration. [0500] Results \u2014 The averaged data for each dosage concentrations (placebo, 80 mg, 160 mg, and 320 mg) of the Abl monoclonal antibody are plotted in Figure 10. All dosage levels of Abl antibody 136 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 demonstrated an immediate drop in CRP concentrations relative to placebo over the period of 12 weeks. CRP levels displayed breakthrough at 8 weeks post-dosing. The CRP levels fell below 5 mg/L by week 12. Median values of CRP demonstrated rapid and sustained decreases for all dosage concentrations relative to placebo (Fig. 11). Thus, administration of Abl to advanced cancer patients can cause a rapid and sustained suppression of serum CRP levels.

Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for methods and/or treatments that reduce serum C-Reactive Protein (CRP) concentrations in cancer patients, and particularly those with advanced cancers. [0503] Methods \u2014 Eight patients with various forms of advanced cancer (colorectal (3), NSCLC (I), cholangio (I), and mesothelioma (2)) received a single I-hour intravenous infusion of either 80 mg (2 patients), 160 mg (3 patients) or 320 mg (3 patients) of the Abl monoclonal antibody. No further dosages of the Abl monoclonal antibody were administered to the test population. [0504] Patients were evaluated prior to administration of the dosage and thereafter on a weekly basis for at least 8 weeks post dose. At the time of each evaluation, patients were screened for serum CRP concentration. CRP concentration was Briefly, about 1.0 mL of patient sample serum was collected and stored in a plastic collection tube. Sample was placed into appropriate buffer, and anti-CRP antibody coupled to latex microparticles was added to the sample to start the reaction. These anti-CRP antibodies with conjugated latex 137 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 microparticles react with antigen in the sample to form an antigen/antibody complex. Following agglutination, this was measured turbidimetrically using a Roche/Hitachi Modular P analyzer. [0505] Results \u2014 Serum CRP levels were greatly reduced in all patients studied (Fig. 12). The reduction in serum CRP levels was rapid, with approximately 90% of the decrease occurring within one week of Abl administration, and prolonged diminished levels continued at least until the final measurement was taken (up to twelve weeks). In all cases except one patient with colorectal cancer, CRP levels fell to at or below the normal reference range (less than 5-6 mg/L) within one week. The colorectal cancer patient achieved similar normal levels by week 4 of the study. Thus, administration of Abl to advanced cancer patients can cause a rapid and sustained suppression of serum CRP levels. EXAMPLE 20 Safety, Pharmacokinetics (PK), and Pharmacodynamics (PD) of Abl in Human Subjects \u2014 humanized antibody derived from Abl (humanized Abl or ALD518) containing the variable heavy and light sequences in SEQ ID NO: 19 and 20 was administered to rheumatoid arthritis patients. This antibody is a humanized, asialated, IgGl monoclonal antibody against IL-6 which has been shown to have a half-life (t'A) of approximately 30 days in humans. In studies in patients with RA, intravenous (IV) with this antibody (humanized AbI) has demonstrated: efficacy over 16 weeks with rapid American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses; Complete and durable suppression of C-reactive protein (CRP); Good tolerability, and a safety profile consistent with the biology of IL-6 blockade. This humanized antibody binds to IL-6 with high affinity, preventing interaction and signalling mediated via IL-6R. Rapid and significant treatment responses have been demonstrated with intravenous (IV) administration of humanized Abl in patients with RA. In this example we study the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of subcutaneous (SC) administration of humanized Abl in healthy subjects. [0507] The objective of this study was to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of a single SC injection of this humanized antibody in healthy male subjects. [0508] Methods \u2014 In this Phase I, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 27 subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive a single dose of humanized Abl or placebo in the following groups: Abl 100 mg IV (n=6 active and n=3 placebo per group). The primary objective was to assess safety of SC humanized Abl versus placebo over 12 weeks. Plasma concentrations of humanized Abl and serum concentrations of C- reactive protein (CRP) were assessed as secondary objectives. Assessments were performed daily in Week I and then on Day 10, Weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8, and then monthly to Week 12. The study was unblinded at Week 12, and humanized Abl subjects were monitored to Week 24. [0509] Study design and population\u2014The study included 27 healthy male subjects (aged 18-65 years). Subjects were dosed in three treatment groups of nine subjects each, randomized 2:1 to receive a single dose of humanized Abl or placebo on Day I. Humanized Abl group 138 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 were: SC 50 mg injection (I mL); or humanized Abl 100 mg injection (I mL). The study was unblinded at Week 12, after which placebo subjects discontinued the trial and ALD518 subjects were monitored to Week 24. [0510] Safety and immunogenicity assessments\u2014 The primaiy objective of the study was to assess the safety of SC humanized Abl compared with placebo over 12 weeks. Safety was monitored over 12 weeks for all subjects. The study was unblinded at Week 12, and Humanized ABl subjects were monitored to Week 24. Laboratory safety tests were performed pre-dose at screening and Day - I , and post dose on Days 2 and 7, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 for all subjects, and Weeks 16, 20 and 24 post\u00ad dose for those randomized to Humanized were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Blood samples were collected at Day I (pre-dose) and Week 12 post-dose for all subjects, and Week 24 post-dose for serum CRP concentrations were assessed by ELISA. For all subjects, samples were collected at screening, pre-dose on Day I, and post-dose on Days 2 and 7 and Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12. For subjects randomized to Humanized ABI, further samples were collected at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 post-dose. [0512] Statistical analysis\u2014AU subjects who received a dose of Humanized ABl or placebo were included in the safety analysis. AU subjects who received a dose of Humanized ABl or placebo were included in PD and immunogenicity analyses. AU subjects who received a dose of Humanized ABl were included in PK analyses (n=l 8). AU PK samples for placebo subjects were confirmed as below quantification. Descriptive statistics were generated for baseline demographics, safety data, plasma Humanized ABl parameters and serum CRP concentrations. Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to compare CRP concentrations for Humanized ABl treatments versus placebo. [0513] Results \u2014 Summary Over 24 weeks, there were no deaths or serious AEs, and no withdrawals due to AEs. Nearly all subjects (89%) experienced AEs, which were mild or moderate except one event of severe gastroenteritis in the Humanized abl SC 50 mg group. Injection site reactions occurred in 5/12 Humanized Abl SC subjects, 1/6 placebo SC subjects and 1/3 placebo IV subjects (none were reported in Humanized Abl IV subjects). These were mild except one case of moderate erythema and pruritis in the Humanized Abl 100 mg SC group. Increases in direct bilirubin and neutrophil counts below the limit of normal were more common in subjects receiving Humanized Abl than placebo; all were CTC Grade I or 2. The half-life of Humanized Abl was similar across all groups (mean range: 30.7-33.6 days). The median Tmax of Humanized Abl was longer after SC (~1 week) than after IV administration (-end of infusion). The PK of SC Humanized Abl was dose-proportional in terms of AUC and Cmax at doses of 50 mg and 100 mg. Based on AUCO-oo (day*pg/mL) of 237, 452 and 764 for the Humanized Abl 50 mg SC, 100 mg SC and 100 mg IV groups, respectively, the bioavailability of Humanized Abl was -60% for the SC versus groups. Subjects receiving 139 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 Humanized Abl experienced rapid and sustained reductions in serum CRP (Fig. 13), similar results were seen when the antibody was administered either intravenous or subcutaneously (Fig. 14). [0514] Subject disposition and baseline demographics\u2014A total of 27 subjects were enrolled and completed the study (n=18 Humanized Abl and n=9 placebo). No subjects were withdrawn for any reason. AU subjects were male; 23/27 subjects were Caucasian and 4/27 were Asian. Mean age was 29 (range 20-59) and was similar across the groups. Mean height and weight were also generally comparable across groups, although the IV placebo group were slightly lighter. [0515] Safety and immunogenicity to Week 12 for Humanized ABl and placebo\u2014 A summary of safety is presented in TABLE 10. For the SC Humanized ABl groups, a total of 11/12 (91%) an adverse event (AE) 3/3 (100%) for the IV placebo group. TABLE 10.

[0516] Across groups: No deaths or serious AEs were reported and there were no withdrawals due to AEs. Most AEs were mild or moderate in intensity. One case of gastroenteritis in a SC Humanized ABl 50 mg subject was considered severe, but not serious, and not related to study medication. No anti-Humanized ABl antibodies were detected in any subject during this period. [0517] Injection site reactions\u2014Injection site reactions were reported in 26% (7/27) of subjects, and all occurred prior to Week 12 (TABLE 11). Injection site reactions occurred in 5/12 SC Humanized ABl subjects and 1/6 SC placebo subjects. In the IV groups, 0/6 Humanized ABl subjects and 1/3 placebo subjects experienced injection site reactions. AU injection site reactions were mild except in one SC Humanized ABl 100 mg subject with moderate injection site erythema and pruritis. No injection site reactions occurred after Week 12 in any of the Humanized ABl groups.

AU ALT and AST levels were Grade I by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), and no levels were >3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). All increases in total and direct bilirubin were CTCAE Grade I or 2 and no subject 141 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 met criteria for drug-induced liver damage. Only one subject (SC Humanized ABl 100 mg group) had total bilirubin out of range (26 /L, range 0-24 /L), at Week 24.

Neutrophil counts below the lower limit of normal were more common in subjects receiving Humanized ABl than placebo but all decreases were CTCAE Grade I or 2. Only one subject (SC Humanized ABI 50 mg group) had consistent mild neutropenia to Week 24 (1.6 x 109 /L at Week 24). Reductions in platelet counts were all CTCAE Grade I (lowest level 134 x 109 /L) and no subject had a low platelet count past Week 8. [0520] and 100 mg versus IV Humanized ABl 100 mg groups based on the mean AUC0 .o o (TABLE 13). The half-life of Humanized ABI was similar across all groups (mean range: 30.7-33.6 days) (Table G). Peak plasma concentration (Cm a x ) of SC Humanized ABl was reduced as compared to IV (Fig. 15). Median time to maximum plasma concentration (Tm a x ) of Humanized Abl was longer after SC Humanized ABl (at approximately one week) than after IV Humanized Abl administration (at approximately the end of infusion).

From Weeks 4 to 12, CRP levels were significantly lower in subjects who received Humanized Abl compared with placebo (unadjusted p-value <0.05). A high correlation between the IgG produced and antigen specificity for an exemplary IL-6 protocol was observed with 9 of 11 wells showed specific IgG correlation with antigen recognition. In Humanized ABl subjects, CRP levels were lowered to <20% of (13/18) of subjects subjects at Week 12; and 56% (10/18) of subjects at Week 24. [0522] Conclusions \u2014 In this Phase I study, the anti-IL-6 antibody Humanized Abl was generally well tolerated when administered in a single SC dose in healthy male subjects. Injection site reactions were generally mild. No anti-Humanized Abl antibodies were detected. Changes in liver enzymes, neutrophil and platelet counts were reversible. The bioavailability of SC Humanized ABl was approximately 60% of Humanized Abl. The half-life of Humanized ABl was approximately 30 days, irrespective of route of administration. These data concur with previous data using IV serum CRP. Reductions in CRP observed during the first 12 weeks of the study were sustained over 24 weeks of assessment. These preliminary data support the continued development and evaluation of subcutaneous Humanized Abl for the treatment of patients with psoriatic arthritis. [0523] In summary, in this Phase I study, the anti-IL-6 antibody Humanized Abl was well tolerated when administered in a single SC dose; injection site reactions were generally mild. The bioavailability SC Humanized Abl was -60% of IV Humanized Abl, and the half-life was -30 days. Rapid and significant reductions in CRP were observed, which were sustained over 24 weeks of assessment. EXAMPLE 21 Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Dose Ranging, Multi-Center (Phase IIIB) Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of BMS-945429 (\"clazakizumab\") Subcutaneous Injection in Adults with Active Psoriatic Arthritis [0524] Background \u2014 Psoriatic arthritis (PsA), a seronegative spondyloarthropathy is a complex disease involving peripheral and axial joints, periarticular structures (e.g., enthesitis, inflammation of other soft tissues, dactylitis) as well as the skin and nails. Without appropriate management, the 143 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 number of joints affected by PsA and the severity of joint damage increase over time, which can lead to marked restrictions of the daily activities and to substantially compromised quality of life. Evidence has shown that accelerated atherosclerosis, obesity, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease are associated with active PsA. Other co-morbidities such as pulmonary fibrosis, uveitis, and, less commonly, aortic and aortic valve inflammation also contribute to complexity of PsA. [0525] Unlike RA, effective treatment options are limited for PsA, Saad et al. (2008) J Rheumatol. 35:883-90; Kavanaugh et al. (2006) J Rheumatol. 33:1417-21; Lee Gavin (2010) The Hong Kong Medical Diary. 15:26-7; Nash P. (2006) J Rheumatol. 33:1431-4. Responses to the traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) suboptimal. Kavanaugh et al. Soriano (2006) J Rheumatol. 33:1422-30. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapies are efficacious for both skin and joint diseases but approximately 40% of subjects treated with anti-TNF agents do not reach a minimal improvement injoint responses (ACR20) and a large portion of subjects do not reach higher level responses (i.e. ACR50 or 70). Mease et al. (2000) The Lancet. 356:385-90; Mease et al. (2004) Arthritis and Rheum. 50(7):2264-72; Genovese et al. (2007) J Rheumatol. (2005) Arthritis and Rheum. 52:3279-89; Mease P. (2007) Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management. 3:133-48; Antoni et al. (2005) Arthritis and Rheum. 52:1227-36; Antoni et al. (2008) J Rheumatol. 35:869-876; Antoni et al. (2005) Ann Rheum Pis. 64:1150-7. Several effective RA therapies have not provided the desired response in PsA and left the anti-TNF agents the major class of approved biologic therapy for PsA. Mease et al. (2011) Arthritis and Rheum. 63:939-948. Several agents under development for PsA had good efficacy for psoriatic skin lesions but with less optimal joint efficacy. Mease P. (2006) Bulletin of the NYU Hospital for Joint Diseases. 64: 25-31; Weger W. (2010) British Journal of Pharmacology. 160:810- 20; Gottlieb et al. (2009) The Lancet. 373:633-40. [0526] Therefore, there is still a significant unmet need in PsA for therapies that provide higher levels of efficacy in the joints in a greater proportion of subjects especially with the additional attributes of durability of effect over time, low immunogenicity, a subcutaneous dosing regimen that may allow for less frequent administration, and a risk benefit profile that remains acceptable. [0527] INTRODUCTION: This example presents results from the 24-week double-blind period for clinical study randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, multicenter study, followed by a long-term extension (LTE) in subjects with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) as diagnosed by the Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR) with active disease, who had an inadequate response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) and naive to or with non-biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs antibody (anti-IL-6 mAb) that is being developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMS) 144 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other non-oncology related indications. Clazakizumab is also known as ALD-518 and is being developed by Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alder) for use in cancer patients. [0529] Interleukin-6 is a soluble pleiotropic cytokine that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory conditions, including RA. I Interleukin-6 mediates various functions of multiple cell types, both immune and non-immune. These functions include cell proliferation and differentiation, cell activation, B-cell secretion of antibodies, hepatocyte production of acute phase proteins, and hematopoiesis. The clinical relevance of IL-6 in RA is demonstrated by the approval of tocilizumab (Actemra\u00ae), a monoclonal antibody that binds to the IL-6 receptor and blocks the biologic activity of IL-6. Monthly intravenous (IV) administrations of tocilizumab significantly improve signs and symptoms and suppress joint damage in RA patients. [0530] In contrast, clazakizumab binds to the soluble human IL-6 cytokine, rather than to the IL-6 receptor. Together with other properties such as high potency and long half-life (-30 days), the characteristics of clazakizumab may result in a differentiated clinical profile compared to tocilizumab or other biologies. [0531] In this study, clazakizumab was administered subcutaneously (SC) in subjects with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis with inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). This dose-ranging, placebo/active-controlled study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of clazakizumab with MTX or clazakizumab monotherapy to placebo on background MTX over 24 weeks. Given the significant unmet needs in PsA, this study in PSA (IM133004) was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SC injection of clazakizumab in PsA. [0532] Objectives \u2014The primary objective during the double-blind period was to compare the efficacy of three doses of clazakizumab subcutaneous (SC) versus placebo (PBO) as assessed by American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement (ACR20) response rates at 16 weeks. [0533] The secondary objectives of the double-blind period were to: (i) assess additional efficacy outcomes of clazakizumab SC at 16 weeks as measured by psoriasis area and severity index (PASI; specifically PAS175), ACR50 and ACR70 response rates, physical function and health related quality of life outcomes; (ii) assess efficacy outcomes of clazakizumab SC at 24 weeks as measured by PASI75, ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 response rates, physical function and health related quality of life outcomes; and (iii) assess safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of clazakizumab SC injections. [0534] Methodology \u2014 This clinical study report presents results from the 24-week double-blind period for Study IM133004 (incorporated 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, multicenter study, followed by an long-term extension (LTE) in subjects with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) by the Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR) with active disease, who had an inadequate response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) (Randomization/Day I to Week 16): Upon meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria, subjects were randomized to I of the 4 treatment arms (placebo or clazakizumab 25 mg SC every 4 weeks, 100 mg SC every 4 weeks, or 200 mg SC every 4 weeks) with a 1:1:1:1 ratio as shown in Figure 16. [0536] After the study began, that FDA mandated that all subjects be on active treatment to avoid the potential for radiographic progression over 24 weeks in subjects randomized to placebo. The protocol was amended to attempt to put all subjects on methotrexate (MTX) and to standardize the MTX treatment by placing such subjects on MTX at Week 16. Subjects who were not on MTX between Weeks 0 and 16 were allowed to continue without MTX until Week 16 when they were all placed on MTX. [0537] Period II (Week 16 to Week 241: AU subjects who completed Period I continued to receive the same treatment assignments during Weeks 16 to 24. Subjects who had been enrolled in this study but were not yet randomized, and who were not on a background of MTX, were placed on oral MTX 15 mg/week (but no less than 10 mg/wk) at Week 16; this allowed subjects randomized to placebo to be placed on active therapy. Those subjects (who enrolled early in the study) who were between Weeks 0 and 16 and who were not on MTX were allowed to continue without receiving MTX until Week 16 when they were all placed on MTX. Subjects who were after Week 16 by the time of the FDA mandate (for active treatment) and were not already on MTX were allowed to go on without MTX to Week 24 when they started receiving clazakizumab 200 mg as per protocol. [0538] During Period II, doses of oral glucocorticosteroids could be changed but the total dose remained < 10 mg/day of prednisone or prednisone equivalent. NSAID dose changes were also allowed according to investigator's clinical judgment for appropriate disease management. [0539] In addition, subjects that did not achieve at least a 20% reduction compared to baseline in the swollen and tender joint count during Weeks 16 to 24, and in the LTE until the switch to the final dose of 25 mg clazakizumab, were eligible for rescue therapy. [0540] NUMBER OF SUBJECTS (Planned and Analyzed): 168 subjects were planned to be included (42 subjects per arm); 165 subjects were analyzed (41 each in the placebo, 25 mg clazakizumab, and 200 mg clazakizumab groups and 42 subjects in the 100 mg clazakizumab group). [0541] DIAGNOSIS AND MAIN CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION: Subjects must have had a diagnosis of PsA by CASPAR criteria and had active disease for at least 12 weeks prior to screening. Subjects must have had inadequate responses to NSAIDs and/or non-biologic DMARD therapy. Subjects must have had a minimum of > 3 swollen and > 3 tender joints (66/68 joint counts); active psoriatic skin lesions of > 3% Body Surface Area (BSA); and a high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) of > ULN (by central laboratory values) at screening. Subjects who were on MTX were allowed if they had been taking MTX for at least 3 months at a dose > 15 mg/week to a maximum weekly dose of ~ 146 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 25 mg, and were at a stable dose of MTX for 4 weeks prior to randomization (Day I). Other non\u00ad biologic DMARDs had to be washed out according to the protocol. [0542] Subjects are excluded if they had previously received or were currently receiving an approved biologic therapy for PsA or psoriasis. Subjects were excluded if they had active systemic inflammatory condition other than PsA which might have interfered with the results of clinical or laboratory tests planned in the study (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus or any other systemic rheumatic disease other than PsA). [0543] CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION: Efficacy: Clinical joint, skin, dactylitis, and enthesitis assessments were conducted. The primary efficacy assessment was the proportion of subjects meeting the ACR criteria for improvement (ACR20) at Week 16. The secondary efficacy assessments comprised: individual components of the ACR core data set, ACR50, ACR70, PASI75, Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI), Short Form (36) (SF-36). Safety: The evaluation of drug safety was based on clinical AEs, vital signs, ECGs and laboratory abnormalities reported during the double-blind study period. Immunogenicity: Serum samples were assayed for the presence of anti-clazakizumab antibodies. [0544] STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS : For the primary endpoint of ACR20 at Week 16, assuming the placebo response rate of 15% with an a = 0.017 (two-sided), approximately 42 subjects per arm (total 168) would provide around 85% power to detect a difference in treatment response rate of 37%. [0545] The primary testing procedure involved 3 comparisons of clazakizumab (25 mg SC every 4 weeks, 100 mg SC every 4 weeks, or 200 mg SC every 4 weeks) versus placebo and Dunnett- Tamhane step-up procedure was performed to control the overall type I error rate at 0.05 for multiple comparisons. [0546] EFFICACY RESULTS: [0547] Overall Efficacy Summary: The study met its primary objective of at least one dose of clazakizumab being statistically superior to placebo on the primary endpoint of ACR20 at Week 16. [0548] The proportion of subjects with an ACR20 response rate at Day 113 (Week 16) was numerically higher in the 3 clazakizumab groups compared with the placebo group (Table 14 and Figure 17). In the 100 mg clazakizumab group, this improvement (difference of 23.1%) was statistically superior to placebo (adjusted p-value=0.039; Table 14). TABLE 14.

[0549] No dose response for efficacy was noted in this study; the 25 mg and 100 mg clazakizumab doses tended to show better efficacy results for most parameters compared to the 200 mg clazakizumab dose group and placebo. [0550] When examining efficacy result for the 5 efficacy domains of PsA, the benefits of clazakizumab treatment were shown as follows: [0551] Joints - improvement was noted in tender and swollen joints as shown by positive results of the ACR20, ACR50, ACR70 (Figures 18-20, respectively), individual components of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) (Figure 21 for tender joint count and Figure 22 for swollen joint count), DAS28-CRP (Disease Associated Score, C-reactive protein, data not shown), DAS28-CRP < 2.6 (data not shown), HAQ-DI (Health Assessment Questionnaire, Disability Index, data not shown), and the PsARC (composite index that is predominantly associated with outcomes related to changes in tender and swollen joints, data not shown). Clazakizumab showed early (onset of action by 4 weeks) and consistent improvement over placebo in these joint measures with greater improvement more often being seen in the 25 mg and 100 mg clazakizumab doses compared to the 200 mg dose at Day 113 (Week 16) and Day 169 (Week 24). [0552] Skin - there was no difference in the PASI75 (Psoriasis Area Severity Index) between any of the clazakizumab doses and placebo at Day 113 (Week 16); however, there appeared to be a marginal improvement over placebo in both the 25 and 100 mg clazakizumab dose groups on the PASI75 and PASI50 response at Day 169 (Week 24). No consistent results were noted when comparing mean change from baseline in PASI over time (data not shown). [0553] Enthesitis - there was apparent improvement in enthesitis with clazakizumab treatment compared with placebo. The SPARCC Enthesitis Index showed that the proportion of subjects with enthesitis at baseline decreased over time in the 3 clazakizumab dose groups compared with placebo at both Day 113 (Week 16) and Day 169 (Week 24). There was no meaningful difference in the mean change from baseline LEI (Leeds Enthesitis Index) score among the 3 clazakizumab groups and the placebo group (data not shown). [0554] Dactylitis - the results for this parameter based on the LDI (Leeds Dactylitis Index) were not able to be analyzed for this study due to unreliable data collection for this measure. However, in the clazakizumab groups there was an apparent decrease over time in tender and swollen digits among those subjects with at least I tender and swollen digit (data not shown). 148 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 [0555] Spine - In this study, the BASDAI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Index) score was used as a surrogate measure of spinal involvement; in the 25 and 100 mg clazakizumab groups showed a small numerical improvement over placebo on this scale (data not shown). [0556] SAFETY RESULTS: [0557] Overall Safety Summary: Clazakizumab was tolerated at all doses studied. Few subjects discontinued therapy over the first 24 weeks of the study. Nevertheless, the study data did reveal dose-related safety findings. Overall, the 25 mg clazakizumab dose group had the lowest frequency of AEs, discontinuation due to AEs, transaminase abnormalities and injection site reactions whereas a higher incidence of these safety measures was noted in the 200 mg group. Although the safety profile of the 100 mg clazakizumab dose group was similar in many respects to the 25 mg dose group, the benefit-risk profile of clazakizumab appeared most favorable at 25 mg. No new safety signals were observed compared to the RA patients treated with clazakizumab. No subject died during the study and no subject had laboratory abnormalities that met the criteria for Hy's Law. [0558] Safety data were available for 165 subjects in the As-Treated Analysis Population including those subjects who received at least I dose of double-blind treatment. This dataset included the 149 subjects who completed through Week 16 of the study (Period I) and the 140 subjects who completed Weeks 16 to 24 (Period II). Safety observations for the double-blind treatment period include results from Period I (through Week 16; data not shown) and results from both Periods I and II (through Week 24; data not shown). Safety observations for Periods I and II (cumulative through Week 24) are summarized as follows: [0559] Deaths: No subject died during the double-blind treatment period of the study. [0560] Serious Adverse Events (SAEs): Serious adverse events were reported for 10 (6.1%) subjects (including 7 [4.2%] subjects in Period I): 2 subjects (4.9%) in the placebo group, 2 subjects (4.9%) in the 25 mg clazakizumab group, 2 subjects (4.8%) in the 100 mg clazakizumab group, and 4 subjects (9.8%) in the 200 mg clazakizumab group. With the exception of transient hypoesthesia and muscular weakness in Subject IM133004-70-103 in the 200 mg clazakizumab group, none of these SAEs was reported by the investigator to be related to study drug. In the placebo group, SAE PTs were bladder neoplasm and transitional cell carcinoma in I subject and prostate cancer in I subject. In the 25 mg clazakizumab group, SAE was bradycardia and chest pain each in I subject. In the 100 mg clazakizumab group, SAE was psoriasis and dystonia each in I subject. In the 200 mg clazakizumab group, SAEs were hypoesthesia and muscular weakness in I subject, and intervertebral disc disorder, acute myocardial infarction, and hemiparesis each in I subject. [0561] Discontinuations due to Adverse Events (AEs): Thirteen (7.9%) subjects discontinued due to AEs including 2 subjects in the placebo group who discontinued due to SAEs of transitional cell carcinoma and prostate cancer, and I subject in the 200 mg clazakizumab group who 149 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 discontinued due to SAEs of hypoesthesia and muscular weakness. Eight (4.8%) of these subjects discontinued during Period I. [0562] Adverse Events of Special Interest: Infections and infestations (including nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, urinary tract infection [UTI], upper respiratory tract infection [URTI], and bronchitis) were noted in a higher proportion of subjects in the placebo group (48.8%) compared to the 3 clazakizumab groups (36.6%, 35.7%, and 24.4%, in the 25 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg groups, respectively). There were no cases of tuberculosis or reports of opportunistic infections. Hepatic disorders (including increased ALT and AST) were only reported in the 3 clazakizumab groups (22.0%, 16.7%, and 26.8%, in the 25 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg groups, respectively). There was a low incidence (<10% of subjects) of local injection site events in the 25 mg (9.8%) and 100 mg (9.5%) clazakizumab groups and in the placebo group (4.9%); local injection site events were reported with higher frequency in the 200 mg clazakizumab group (17.1%). No subject experienced autoimmune disorders, systemic injection events, demyelinating disorders or gastrointestinal perforations during the double-blind treatment period. There were two malignancies reported in the placebo group (transitional cell carcinoma and prostate carcinoma) but no malignancies were reported in the 3 clazakizumab groups. [0563] Overall AEs: AEs were reported for 123 (74.5%) subjects (including 115 [60.7%] subjects during Period I) and AEs were assessed as drug-related for 71 (43.0%) subjects (including 64 [38.8%] subjects during Period I). The highest incidence of AEs (82.9%) and related AEs (63.4%) were noted in the 200 mg clazakizumab group. Adverse events reported for > 5% of subjects overall included increased ALT Laboratory Abnormalities: With a few exceptions, changes from baseline in most laboratory values were similar across the treatment groups. Changes from baseline that were more prevalent in the clazakizumab groups compared with the placebo group included decreases in mean absolute neutrophil count, decrease in mean platelet count, increases in total cholesterol levels, increases in mean ALT (Alanine aminotransferase), AST (Alkaline phosphatase), and total bilirubin levels, and decreases in mean alkaline phosphatase levels. [0565] Vital Signs and ECG: No safety concerns were identified based on evaluation of laboratory and vital sign data. [0566] PHARMACOKINETIC RESULTS: The following is a brief summary of the key pharmacokinetic findings: The degree of fluctuation between the maximal and minimal (pre-dose) concentration was minimal (less than 2 fold) across dose range following SC administration of clazakizumab. Based on observed trough (Cmin) concentrations, steady-state was reached by the time of Week 20 which is consistent with the half-life of clazakizumab. Following the SC dose of clazakizumab in the range of 25 mg to 200 mg, Cmax and AUC(TAU) (Area under the serum 150 WO 2015/054293 PCT/US2014/059543 concentration-time curve over a dosing interval, TAU = 4 weeks) increased slightly less than proportionally to dose, which may be attributed to limitations in sample size and variability in sample collection times. Median Tmax values were 3 to 7 days (ranged 2 to 21 days) across the treatment groups (data not shown). [0567] PHARMACODYNAMIC RESULTS: As an indicator of target engagement, total (Figure 23) and free (Figure 24) levels of serum IL-6 were measured using validated immunoassays that discriminate between clazakizumab bound IL-6 (total IL-6) vs. non-clazakizumab bound ligand (free IL-6). At baseline, levels of IL-6 ranged between 10 to 25 pg/mL (Table S.9.3). In the placebo arm, there was little change in total or free IL-6 throughout the course of the study. In the clazakizumab treated subjects, free IL-6 decreased below the level of detection (3.6 pg/mL) immediately postdosing and across all dose groups. These changes were observed at the earliest time point (Day 8) and were sustained throughout the study (Day 169 [Week 24]). For the 200 mg clazakizumab dose group, mean levels of free IL-6 demonstrated detectable levels of free IL-6 at Days 8 and 29, however, this result was due to I outlier that had delayed suppression of IL-6 levels. Upon further treatment, this subject showed undetectable levels of free IL-6 starting at Day 57 that were maintained through Day 169. Postdosing with clazakizumab, there was a rapid increase in total IL-6 levels reflective of the increase in drug bound ligand. Total IL-6 levels increased approximately 200-fold above baseline at Day 8 (mean range 2355 to 3832 pg/mL) and appeared to plateau at later time points to approximately 500-fold above baseline (mean range 7175 to 12209 pg/mL at Days 113 and 169). An observed increase in the total IL-6 levels in the 200 mg dose group at Day 113 was driven by a few outliers and was not representative of the entire group. There was a modest dose response that was observed across the dose groups with a lower increase in total IL-6 levels in the 25 mg clazakizumab dose group compared to the two higher clazakizumab dose groups (100 and 200 mg). Overall, these results demonstrate target engagement of clazakizumab treatment at all dose groups and throughout the course of the study.
