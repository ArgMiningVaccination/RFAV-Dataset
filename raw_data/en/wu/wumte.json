Overall, the body possesses its own remarkable internal defence system to help fight infections and germs that we are exposed to on a day-to-day basis. When a healthy body is attacked by germs, our immune system quickly eliminates them. Once attacked by these foreign substances, the body also receives lasting immunity from the antigen as the body learns to recognise it and fight it off. The immune system develops specific antibodies designed to match and destroy these foreign invaders. The immune system unfortunately can be weakened by various [suppressors](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/naturopathic-view/building-and-maintaining-our-immunity-our-bodies-greatest-defense-sysytem/) such as surgery, long and chronic illness, extreme physical and emotional stress - such as the pandemic we are going through right now, improper nutrition, lack of sleep, exposure to toxic chemicals and immunosuppressing medications. Ways to strengthen your immune system The immune system is a complex system of specialized cells that defend the body from infections and disease-causing organisms. The lymphatic system, the liver, spleen, and the thymus all share a responsibility in resisting disease. To keep the immune system working in top condition, there needs to be a harmonious balance in the various systems of the body. So how we create that balance? Let's start with the basics: 1. A healthy lifestyle is one of the key steps to get your immune system working properly. I cannot stress this enough. In practice, I cannot tell you how many I have seen huge improvements in the immune response when clients change habits to a healthier lifestyle, and the frequency and duration of colds and flus drop dramatically, among other health improvements. So, what are some of changes you could make to have a healthier lifestyle? - Try to reduce stress. - Have a diet that is nutritious. A diet that is high in good quality proteins, vegetables, and fruits. - Exercise regularly. Going for walks in nature is good for the mind and great for the body and helps to reduce stress as well. - Try to sleep at the same time daily and get at least 7 - 8 hours of sleep and allow the body to recharge. - Quit smoking. With Every puff you inhale over 60 different harmful chemicals directly into your lungs. - Drink - plenty of water, and if you drink alcohol, decrease your intake of alcohol. 2. Improving immunity with herbs, supplements, and vitamins Walk into a health food store and you will see aisles full of health products, vitamins and supplements that make various claims of health boosting benefits, right? Go online, and you can read about all types of vitamins and herbs that claim to be helpful for various ailments. Here is my recommendation when it comes to taking various vitamins and supplements. There are [immunologic problems related to specific nutrient deficiencies in the body](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/naturopathic-view/building-and-maintaining-our-immunity-our-bodies-greatest-defense-sysytem/). However, to identify what these deficiencies are, talk to your naturopathic doctor first before starting any supplements or vitamins. Listen to the health professionals. Naturopathic doctors have excellent training in this area and have the knowledge to suggest a product or a supplement based on a proper assessment. As a naturopathic doctor, to improve your health and immune function naturally, especially if have been getting sick frequently, and have colds, flu and other respiratory illness that last a long time, the first thing I usually recommend after a comprehensive symptom intake, is a battery of tests to check for the immune function, adrenal status, and vitamin- mineral status. Once we identify what is lacking in the body, recommendations for specific vitamins, herbs and supplements are made based on that, and I have found that to be the best way of improving not just the immune system, but overall health as well. Please ask your doctor or naturopath before starting on any supplements. It is better to first identify the cause and then treat it with the right remedies, even though those mentioned above have minimal side effects.
