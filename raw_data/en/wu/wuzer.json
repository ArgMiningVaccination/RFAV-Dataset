Since June 6, the vaccine has been 64 percent effective at preventing infection and symptomatic disease and 93 percent effective in preventing serious illness in Israel. Earlier studies from the Israeli government said Pfizer's vaccine was 94 percent effective at preventing COVID-19 and 97 percent effective at preventing severe illness. The new figures represent a drop in the vaccine's efficacy rate as the delta coronavirus variant spreads across the country and world, according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-05/israel-sees-decline-in-pfizer-vaccine-efficacy-rate-ynet-says). The time period the researchers studied also coincided with the Israeli government's lifting of social distancing requirements. "}
