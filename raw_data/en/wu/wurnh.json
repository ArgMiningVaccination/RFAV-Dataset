Routine administration of all age -appropriate doses of vaccines simultaneously is recommended for persons for whom no specific contraindications exist. COVID -19 vaccines may be administered regardless of the timing of influenza vaccines, including simultaneous administration of COVID -19 and influenza vaccines on the same day. Administer each vaccine in a different injection site (at least 1 inch apart). Administer vaccines that may be more likely to cause a local reaction (e.g., tetanus -toxoid - containing and PCV13, adjuvanted or high -dose influenza) in different limbs, if possible. 202022 -2023 Recommendations for Influenza Prevention and Treatment in Children: An Update for Pediatric ProvidersInfluenza Toolkits AAP* Flu Toolkit Flu Toolkit 21 2022 -2023 Recommendations for Influenza Prevention and Treatment in Children: An Update for Pediatric Providers*American Academy of PediatricsStorage & Handling Alan Hendrickson, CDPH with bivalent boosters; Pfizer and Moderna now grouped on separate pagesUpdated Pfizer Purple Cap is Leaving!

Test-to-Treat Locator (hhs.gov) 55Clinical Update SNFs 57Proposed Alternative Therapies: Study Cureus | Regular Use of Ivermectin as Prophylaxis for COVID -1958Cureus | Regular Use of as Prophylaxis for COVID -19Study Conclusion: Non-use of Ivermectin was associated with a 12.5 -fold increase in mortality rate and a seven -fold increased risk of dying from COVID -19 compared to the regular use of Ivermectin. This dose - response efficacy reinforces the prophylactic effects of Ivermectin against COVID -19. Prospective observational study involved a program that used Ivermectin at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day for two consecutive days, every 15 days, for 150 days. The regular use of Ivermectin decreased hospitalization for COVID -19 by 100%, mortality by 92%, and the risk of dying from COVID -19 by 86% when compared to non -users.Proposed Alternative Therapies: Ivermectin Study 59Cureus | Regular Use of Ivermectin as Prophylaxis for COVID -19Issues with study: Authored by Ivermectin activists, financial incentives and conflict of interest Methodology flaws: observational study can at most only claim to have found an association between regular Ivermectin use and better outcomes \u2014not that the drug reduced hospitalizations or mortality. Random controlling of certain variables for some factors that might explain the outcomes of the different groups, such as sex, age and some underlying health conditions \u2014but not for other factors related to infection risk, including income. Survivorship bias: once a participant contracted COVID -19 they were advised not to use Ivermectin.Proposed Alternative Therapies: Ivermectin Study 60Issues with study: oMost of the people who took Ivermectin in the study who got sick were not included in the analysis because they couldn't have taken enough pills to be considered a regular user. In contrast, no one in the non -Ivermectin group was removed from that group if they got sick earlier in the study . oBreakdown of study issues here: The Cureus case of Ivermectin for Covid in Brazil, Part 2 -YouTube \"Basically, gaming the outcome so that the strictly regular Ivermectin users have an extremely low rate of sickness and death because, basically, most of the people who got sick are not counted in that group.\" -Biotech and Bioinformatics Study 400 Summary of Results (activ6study.org)Additional evidence that Ivermectin does not affect COVID -19 outcomes from randomized controlled trials : ACTIV -6 trial: People who took Ivermectin during the study did not have fewer hospital or emergency room visits compared to people who took the placebo. COVID -OUT: Studied the use of Ivermectin, Metformin and Fluvoxamine for COVID -19 in 1,323 patients with a SARS -CoV-2 infection, reported that none of the three medications \"prevented the occurrence of hypoxemia, an emergency department visit, hospitalization, or death associated with COVID -19.\" TOGETHER trial: T reatment with a moderate daily Ivermectin dose for three days \"did not result in a lower incidence of medical admission to a hospital due to progression of COVID -19 or of prolonged emergency department observation among outpatients with an early diagnosis of COVID -19.\" Home | COVID -OUT: Outpatient Treatment for SARS -CoV-2 Infection, a Factorial Cost to Patient Paxlovid and Molnupiravir , are a covered Medi -Cal Rx pharmacy benefit for California residents who do not have insurance or currently have private insurance that does not cover COVID -19 therapeutics, and do not qualify for any Medi -Cal programs.

For providers: oAssess people with HIV and STIs for monkeypox vaccination eligibility . oTest persons evaluated for MPX for HIV and STIs including syphilis and testing chlamydia and gonorrhea as M.D., CDPH Division of Communicable Disease Control 91JYNNEOS Vaccine Received and Distributed CDPH MPX Vaccine Webpage92JYNNEOS Vaccine Doses Administered 178,010 total doses have been administered to 134,764 persons in California as of 9/15/22 CDPH MPX Webpage: Vaccine Doses 93How can providers access JYNNEOS vaccine? Supply of vaccine remains limited. Please work with your local health department to obtain doses of JYNNEOS vaccine. Providers are not able to order vaccine directly at this time . CDPH MPX Vaccine Webpage94Who is eligible for JYNNEOS vaccine? Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for Pre-exposure prophylaxis ( ACIP . PEP++ for people with risk factors that increase their likelihood for exposure, even if they have not had known exposure to someone with a confirmed or probable monkeypox infection. CDPH Considerations for Expanded MPX PrEP95PEP++ Priority Populations Tier I Priority Groups: Gay, bisexual, and other men (including cisgender and transgender men) who have sex with men (MSM) or transgender women who meet at least one of the following criteria: Have been diagnosed with a bacterial sexually transmitted disease (e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis) in the past 3 months, OR Have engaged in chemsex or group sex with other men, OR Have had sex recently with anonymous male partners, OR Have attended sex -on-premises venues (e.g., saunas, bathhouses, sex clubs), OR Have engaged in survival and/or transactional sex, OR Are part of other populations who are at highest risk of monkeypox exposure, as identified through local epidemiological investigations. CDPH Considerations for Expanded MPX PrEP96PEP++ Priority Populations Tier II Priority Groups: Gay, bisexual, and other men (including cisgender and transgender men) who have sex with men (MSM) or transgender women who do not meet Tier I criteria but meet one of the following criteria: Have been diagnosed with a bacterial sexually transmitted disease (e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis) between the past 4 -12 months, OR Use or are recommended to use HIV PrEP ,OR Are living with HIV and are considered at risk for monkeypox exposure. CDPH Considerations for Expanded MPX PrEP97Intradermal Administration of JYNNEOS Intradermal administration allowed for adults 18+ Children under 18 and people with a history of keloid formation should receive subcutaneous dosing. Please refer to EZIZ for resources on intradermal dosing. 98JYNNEOS Coadministration Considerations In general, JYNNEOS may be administered without regard to timing of other vaccines. oAdminister each injection in a different injection site. Flu vaccine and JYNNEOS vaccine may be given at the same time. Special considerations for COVID -19 vaccines: oSomeone with recent COVID -19 vaccination: do JYNNEOS if eligible oSomeone with recent JYNNEOS vaccination: some people, particularly adolescent or young adult males, might consider delaying COVID -19 vaccination for 4 weeks after JYNNEOS vaccination. CDC Interim Guidance for Jynneos Vaccine99CDC MPX Vaccine Equity Pilot Program Announced September 15thby CDC. CDPH coordinating responses from local health departments. 10,000 vials of vaccine for pilot (up to 50,000 intradermal doses). Each project selected can request an advance of up to 100 vials (300 -500doses). Prioritize groups with risk factors that increase their chances of getting or spreading MPX, who are over -represented among monkeypox cases and less likely to be vaccinated, and whose barriers to vaccination may be addressed by the activities proposed. Special consideration will be given to projects addressing disparities among Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender and gender -diverse people who have sex with men. Please reach out to your local health department if you are interested proposing a project.
