For good reason: Many of the same foods that you use to nurture your body are healthy when applied topically as well. Advertisement So if you're looking to experiment with a new Sunday night mask or DIY your own body oil, you'll likely find what you need right at home\u2014or with a quick grocery store run. But don't just take our word for it: There's actually research to back these claims up.

People also love it because they find it absorbs easier than other, thicker oils (there's likely some truth there: It's a monounsaturated fat, which [has higher permeability rates for the dermis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26161938/) [6](#citations)). However, coconut oil has also been [found to be comedogenic](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/could-coconut-oil-be-clogging-your-pores)\u2014pore-clogging\u2014in some patients. It's also very high in lauric acid, which can accumulate in the top layer of the skin without penetrating, leaving the skin drier over time if used too much.
