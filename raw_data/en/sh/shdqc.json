App Leaflet - Welsh version Easy steps to download the award-winning BMJ Best Practice app. Both senior and junior healthcare professionals in the acute setting often struggle with the diagnosis and treatment of patients who present with existing conditions. In the UK, one in three adults suffer from multiple chronic conditions and most patients in the acute setting have more than one medical condition. This is a significant and costly global problem. Managing the treatment of patients with comorbidities is hard - clinical guidelines only focus on single conditions - but failure to manage comorbidities leads to worse clinical outcomes and longer lengths of stay. In response to this, BMJ has integrated the Comorbidities Manager into BMJ Best Practice. This is the only point of care tool that supports the management of the whole patient by including guidance on the treatment of a patient's acute condition alongside their pre-existing comorbidities. Healthcare professionals are prompted to consider the patient's comorbidities when accessing treatment information. The tool then produces an initial management plan that is tailored to the unique needs of the patient. Content is written using evidence-based guidelines, as well as by Clinical Experts. Treating the acute presentation alongside existing conditions in this way enables hospitals to increase quality of care and efficiencies through the effective management of the patient. This in turn means better clinical outcomes, shorter hospital stays and fewer readmissions. | | How to use the Comorbidities Manager | | Hear from the Comorbidities Expert Panel | | | | Userguide - Print Poster - Digital A3 Poster - Print A4 Poster - Print Social Media Banners Email Signatures Email, Bulletin and Social Media Copy [1.
