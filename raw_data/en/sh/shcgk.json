I restate the T erms of Reference for this inquiry passed by the A ssembly on 2 December 2021: \"T hat the Public Health A mendment Bill 2021 (No 2) be referred to the Standing Committee on Health and Community W ellbeing for inquiry and report by 28 February 2022.\" W hile I agree that the T erritory needs to have a strategy to deal with emergencies, however, I would like to express my reservations with som e of the provisions within this Bill. SCIENTIFIC BASED AND PEER -REVIEWED EVIDENCE I consider it most important to submit that the A CT Government first seriously considers all scientific -based information and data which is available internationally (including all legal information relevant to the matter) which has been peer -reviewed proving the undoubted existence of t h e SARS -CoV -2 virus from which the Covid -19 disease is derive d. I submit that this should be the m inimum standard that the A CT Government should adopt which will then form the basis for the creation of any such Framework as is intended through this proposed law. I believe that proving the existence of the SARS -CoV -2 virus will provide the ACT Gove rnm ent with the appropriate recognition, legal justification , and authority to create this proposed Framework including the powers that are in this proposed Bill. Conversely, if the scientific and legal evidence relied upon does not show that the SARS -CoV -2 virus has been isolated, then I submit that the proposed F ramework contained in this draft Bill (pa rticularly those that create powers to impose lockdowns, segregate persons, the power to vaccinate a person potentially against their will) including the provision in Section 118ZP granting immunity to the Territory could all possibly lack legal merit. This will have significant and grave legal , moral, and ethical implications for this present government and future governments and more concerningly, for the residents of the A CT. I submit that until today, no government or health authority in the world has been able to convincingly show evidence that the said S ARS -CoV-2 exists i.e., that it has been purified/isolated and identified following the scientifically established procedure of Koch's postulate and/or Rivers Protocol . A ustralia is included amongst these, and I have in my possession a correspondence from the CEO Health Se rvices Office dated 19 M arch 2021 where the response was that the relevant authority does not have the ability to isolate the virus, nor does it hold any such records attesting to this fact in its possession. I submit this letter (amongst other clustered c orrespondences of the same enquiry) for ease of reference. 3 T he point I am trying to put across here is the need to ensure that due diligence has been carried out and that all relevant scientific information and data is interrogated and sufficiently questioned especially when human lives are concerned. I attach renowned G erman virologist, Dr Stefan L anka' s article discussing his case in the German courts concerning the existence of the measles virus. T here are those who disagree with him however, I submit his work for consideration because all relevant and important information should be considered and deliberated upon. A rtificial barriers created by government authorities limiting/stopping the consideration of relevant and important scientific information o utside of accepted channels should be reconsidered. True science can be questioned. IMPORTANCE OF RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS AND THE OFFICE OF THE ACT HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION I submit that ambivalence and tokenism is clearly evident in the proposed Bill with differing weighted values assigned to the offices of the Chief Healt h Officer (CHO) and the Office of the A CT Human Rights Commission (A CT/HRC). W here there is a mention of the A CT /HRC, there is the requirement to 'consult' only on matters addressed in the Bill and t he provisions are silent on the framework of this consult ation: W hen is the consultation to be made; Wh o is responsible for actually undertaking the consultation ; Wh a t questions should be asked in this consultation; and W hat actions, if any, should be taken if there are concerns and/or advice contrary to the direction(s) of the A CT G overnment. Most worrying is that there is no legal requirement to 'take into account' any input from the A CT /HRC and, as mentioned earlier, if there is/are any adverse finding(s) or contentious issues raised by that office, the pr oposed Bill is silent on how this will/should be treated. I refer for example to Section 118T (2) which says that the A CT /HRC will be consulted after a decision has been made with the justification being that the matter was so urgent that it would have b een grossly improper to stop to consult the Office about possible human rights issues. The Bill stops short of providing at what time thereafter should the A CT/HRC be 'consulted' and does not expressly provide that any advice from that office must be taken into account in any decision- making process. T he difference in treatment is clearly shown in Section 118ZM (2) where the proposed law requires that the CHO should be asked, and his/her advice taken into account whereas the A CT/HRC is only consulted and t here is no legal requirement to take into account any issues which may arise from this consultation. A nd again, if there is/are any contentious issue(s) raised , what should be done about this/these. The proposed law is silent on this point. T he same issue can be seen in Section 118Y (3)(b)(ii). I n Section 118Y (3) (4), there is the situation of 'immediate and imminent risk' which term is not defined in this proposed law however, the point is that the CHO can either issue a direction or grant an extens ion in such circumstances and only consult the A CT/HRC after the decision is 4 made . T hese provisions are open to interpretation but more importantly, seem to give a medical officer the powers to issue or grant directions with minimal or no reference to the rights and freedoms of persons being honoured and protected. T he fear is that any justification thereafter as required under subsection 4 will merely serve to rubber stamp the decision already made. A dditionally, there are other rights and freedoms which have been glossed over in the name of community protection for instance, p rivacy rights ; the right not to be discriminated against ; the right to life ; the right to recognition and equality before the law; freedom of movement ; freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief ; freedom of expression etc. are, through this proposed law, being willingly sacrificed without the necessary legislative checks and balances being put in place. T here are no purposeful and sufficient checks and balances built into this proposed law to restrain the exercise of power upon A CT residents and therefore, it is submitted that this must be re -examined carefully , and the ne cessary checks and balances must be incorporated to ensure that the proposed powers created under this law are justifiab le and legally sound. PROPOSED SECTION 118Z - VACCINATION DIRECTION T here are a few issues that I would like to raise concerning this part. I would presume that the power to vaccinate a person has been found to be within the limitations set out in Section 28 of the A CT Human Rights A ct 2004. However, I wish to refer to Section 10 (2) of the same ACT Human Rights Act (which is itself tak en from A rticle 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) which provides: No-one may be subjected to medical or scientific experimentation or treatment without his or her free consent. (My emphasis) I wish to submit here that the vaccines currently approved for use in A ustralia (and which are being used in the A CT ) are provisionally approved only. T he Federal G overnment Health website says: T he T herapeutic Goods A dministration (T GA ) approves vaccines for use in A ustralia after a careful evaluation process. Th e COVID -19 vaccines have provisional approval . Th is m e a n s they can be legally used in Australia because the need for early access outweighs the risks. The manufacturers continue to collect data on vaccine safety and efficacy and will apply for full approval later . T hese are vaccines which are still undergoing tests and experimentation and are provisionally approved which I submit means that the vaccine manufacturers have not , as yet, met the very high standards required for full approval by the authorities . The y are essentially experimental drugs. W hy then is the law being used to mandate the vaccination of a person with an experimental v accine absent the person's consent? The other factual point I wish to submit is that at this point, the vaccination rate in the A CT is the highest of any State/T erritory in A ustralia and may be the highest of any 5 capital city in the world! On the A CT government website, https://www.covid19.act.gov.au/ , it notes that the A CT currently has a 98.5% vaccination rate for double- dosed persons aged 12 years and above. T his does not take into account the roll -out for those aged 5 -11 years which began on 11 January 2021. One may argue, and it has already been said, that the A CT has achieved herd immunity. I n an article on the A BC online website dated 31 December annheim wrote that at best guess, 1 percent of those eligible for vaccination have not been vaccinated. His estimate at the time was that the 1 percent equated to about 3600 Canberrans. T his number may have already reduced from the date of that article to today' s date. T his number aside, there is already mounting evidence that whether a person is vaccinated or is not vaccinated against the Cov id -19 virus (irrespective of which vaccine they choose), the person is equally capable (irrespectiv e of their vaccination status) of contracting and spreading the disease. G overnment Federal data shows that 92.3% of A ustralians aged 16 years and above are double- vaccinated and yet the number of Omicron cases in all States/T erritories are surging and I would suggest that those numbers are predominantly persons who have been vaccinated. I f we are to take the media as being true, then the Omicron variant was brought into Australia by two healthy, double -dosed persons who travelled from CT residents were willing to receive vaccinations within a short period of time. T he only barriers were availability of vaccines, long waiting queues, and the time between doses. T he UK Health Security A gency' s Covid -19 vaccine surveillance report W eek 42 issued around Oc tober 2021 notes that: Although individuals may not develop symptoms of COVID -19 after v accination, it is possible that they could still be infected with the virus and could transmit to others. It also adds: In the context of very high vaccine coverage in the population, even with a highly effective v accine, it is expected that a large proportion of cases, hospitalisations and deaths would occur in vaccinated indiv iduals, simply because a larger proportion of the population are vaccinated than unvaccinated and no vaccine is 100% effective. Note that this UK A gency report was issued prior to Omicron' s arrival. The A TA GI in its most recent 'Statement on the Omicron variant and the timing of Covid -19 booster vaccination' dated 24 December 2021 states that according to the evidence they have seen, the efficacy in the first and second doses have waned and 6 therefore a booster dose will be needed to increase efficacy. However, in saying this, they add: T he effectiveness of a booster dose to prevent onward transmission of Omicron from infected persons, and the duration of protection afforded by a booster are currently orld Health Organisation (W HO) strongly encourages the uptake of primary vaccinations (the first two doses) and more import antly that it is administered to groups at greater risk of developing severe disease In this article, the WHO also questions the giving of booste rs especially in those countries who are now offering 4th and 5th jabs recommending a reconsideration of this decision. T he European M edical A ssociation is asking I n the latest Bureau of Statistics data for the y ear 2020 ( https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/causes -death/causes -death -australia/latest - release ), it reported that Covid -19 was the 38th leading cause of death in A ustralia. The median age of those who died from Covid -19 was 86 years old! In its latest data derived from provisional mortality statistics for the period Jan 2020 - Oct 2021 released on 22 December 2021 for statistics on deaths as a result of Covid to 31 October 2021 ( https://www.abs.gov.au/articles/covid -19-mortality -2), it notes that A ustralia has recorded 1671 deaths with 16 unconfirmed. T he A CT recorded 10 deaths in this period. So which gr oup of people is this provision on vaccination direction targeting? There are a number of further questions that arise here: 1. W hy do we have a specific health framework for a disease that is 38 th on the list of deaths in A ustralia? W hat about all the other leading causes of death on the list numbering 1 -37? 2. Has the A CT G overnment considered creating and framing a risk management framework (which is sensible, logical and responsive to inter alia the data showing on the A BS report ) that specifically addresses the most vulnerable of our population instead of lumping all age groups together and treating them the same? 3. W hy is there a need for mandating vaccination when its efficacy wanes within a short period of time meaning that a vaccinated person can still contract and spread the virus within the community? 4. Does this mean that ev en those who have been vaccinated once (but hesitate to take the second dose); and those vaccinated twice (but hesitate and/or decide not to take the booster dose) may also be issued with a vaccination direction? 7 5. Wh a t is /are the true purpose (s) of this authority to mandate the vaccination of a person when the circumstances at this present time in the ACT i.e., a 98.5% vaccination rate for starters , does not support such a drastic response? 6. Why is it necessary to create the legal authority to potentially forcibly v accinate a person with an experimental vaccine and in some cases, against the will of a person if that person does not want/wish to be vaccinated? 7. W hy mandate the vaccination of a person when herd immunity has already been achieved? 8. Does the vaccination direction apply t o children? 9. Does the vaccination direction apply to foreigners such as international students ? 10. W hy has the A CT G overnment not released the directions or legal instruments along with this copy of the Bill for public deliberation? I submit that right now, the risk assessment process adopted by the A CT G overnment in early January 2021 (classifications of high, moderate, and low) is by far the most sensible and logical way forward i.e., self -assessment of symptoms which correlates to type of action to be taken by the person. I n this way, a person is responsible for their own health/medical decisions and the status quo should remain so. A fter all, the Prime Minister has been urging authori ties and A ustralians to move on with our lives and learn to live with Covid like it's the flu! ( hy the need then to create a power to mandate vaccinations when the same is not done for any other disease (especially those listed 1 -37 ahead of Covid as the highest cause of deaths in A ustralia in the Census 2020 stati stics) , even the common flu which had a very high mortality rate each and every year before Covid-19 came into the picture but was never given the same grand attention that has been giv en to Covid. This also goes back to my earlier point that all decision s must be made based on a consideration of all scientifically based and peer -reviewed ev idence that is available worldwide in order to arrive at a decision that is fair and just. I t must not be based only on evidence that seems to favour the popular or desired cause of action or the sponsor/manufacturer of the three -approved v accines in A ustralia. DEFINITION OF PERSON For th e purposes of this Bill, it is unclear whether the term ' person' and/or ' affected person' include s children as well ? I f another law already covers the specific categorisation of persons covered under these terms and limits its application to adult persons over the age of 18 years then this issue is moot. However, if the definition of these terms i s open , I submit that there should be clear guidance and advice sought from all relev ant stakeholders including the A CT Human Rights Commission on the subject matter i.e., whether the term ' person' and/or ' affected person' includes children. I f children are included, there are many issues for careful conside ration (derived from International Conventions, Commonwealth law and Territory laws) most important of which is the paramount right of parents to decide the 8 welfare (including matters concerning medical treatment) of their child/children and consequently, if parental rights can be limited in such circumstances. IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION This then leads to the issue of liability as provided in the proposed Section 118ZP. I f the process laid out in this proposed law is as detailed and thorough as it is on the decision -making process taken when deciding to issue a vaccination direction to a person, why then are the decision -makers and/or the T erritory not liable for any damage or injury that a person may suffer from the vaccine(s) or the vaccination? W hy is there a visible lack of accountability by the Territory if proposed authorised persons such as the Executive are given the power to make decisions about vaccinating a pers on for the protection of the community? W hy do we try and mandate vaccinations with an experimental vaccine and then refuse liability or take responsibility for our decisions? Does the immunity mean that there is no confidence in the experimental vaccine' s safety and efficacy? If it is, then I submit that there is no reasonable cause to mandate it at all . W hile the Federal G overnment has introduced the ' No Fault Covid -19 Indemnity Scheme' , it only covers verifiable injuries which result from an adverse reaction to the vaccine ab ove $5000. However, if a person is issued with a vaccination direction under the proposed Section 118Z and consequently suffers from damage or injury from the vaccine and/or the vaccination, the person has no recompense if the monetary equivalent of the damage or injury suffered falls below $5000. The damage or injury is not only suffered by the person but has the potential to affect others around the person including their immediate family and dependents, friends, workmates, employer(s), and the list goes on. T here is also no evidence available at this time showing how long damage or injury from a vaccine or vaccination lasts, if at all, and what impact it will have on a person' s life generally in particular upon his capacity to live his/her life as he/she desires. T he simple analogy is a person who drives his/her car directly at anoth er person, whether there is malice or not, that driver is potentially and /or criminally liable for any injuries suffered by the person hit by the car. It is submitted that the A CT Government should carefully reconsider this part in good conscience, and /or at the very least, cover the cost up to $5000. CONCLUSION In conclusion, I would just to like to go back to the most important point in this submission requesting that the A CT Government seriously consider all scientific -based inform ation and data (including all legal information relev ant to the matter) (not limited to information provided on the Federal government health website) which has been peer -reviewed proving the undoubted existence of the SA RS -V -2 virus from which the Covid -19 disease is derived. A nd further, that proof of the existence of the disease was derived using the K och's postulate and/or Rivers Protocol . T his proposed Bill also worryingly lacks important checks and balances against the powers created under th e proposed Framework. It is submitted that the government 9 should have another look at the provisions and incorporate the necessary checks and balances especially from a human rights perspective. A fter all, this Framework is being created to bring about dra stic measures aimed at curtailing the rights and freedoms of residents in the A CT from a disease that is 38 th on the list of causes of death in A ustralia, where only 2 persons have died from this disease and where the median age of deceased persons is 86 years old . Where is the justification for such a level of response? I end by again referring to the responses from the Health departments around the world which I have attached when asked to provide evidence showing the isolation of the SARS -V -2 virus whic h would have proven the existence of the Covid -19 virus and consequently justified all the lockdowns, mandated vaccinations, masking requirements, social distancing rules, and all other limitations to the rights and freedoms of persons since 2020. T he A CT G overnment and the A ustralian Federal government do not have any information on this question as well. T here are court cases filed all over the world including one that is before the International Criminal Court (ICC) at the Hague that is providing solid evidence in this regard hence, I submit that its incumbent on the Territory to do its own due diligence rather than rely on what is being passed down for acceptance without question. True science is always subject to questions. The A CT G overnment has been radical in the past on issues like same sex marriage and legalising of marijuana. I t should demonstrate equal radicalism in taking steps to add common sense on this issue. Respectfully submitted. Thank you.

Yours sincerely Jill Vintiner Joint General Manager health and Environment Group - Health ESR SARS- CoV- 2 is the virus that causes COVID -19 The science behind the association of a specific microorganism with a specific disease has evolved considerably since Koch's postulates were published. Changes to the concept of infectious diseases, the role that host immunity plays in the development of symptomatology, and the revolution in laboratory testing and genome sequencing h ave replaced the requirement for infectious agents to cause disease in healthy humans in order to prove causation. Taken together, there is an overwhelming body of evidence (including satisfying Koch's postulates) that the disease known as COVID- 19 is caused by the SARS -CoV- 2 virus. The relationship between SARS -CoV-2 and COVID -19 In late 2019 a cluster of cases of severe pneumonia in Wuhan, China, was identified through a local severe illness reporting system which was set up after the SARS outbreak. On 3 1 December the WHO China country office was informed of the cases and on 3 January 2020, 44 cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were reported of whom 11 were very ill. At that time the infectious agent had not been identified. Respiratory samples from the symptomatic individuals were tested and a corona virus, similar to SARS - CoV was identified in all the patients. The virus was named SARS -CoV- 2. The following steps have been undertaken to provide assurance that SARS - CoV- 2 is the virus that causes the sever e respiratory illness known as COVID- 19. The full genome of the virus was sequenced which has enabled accurate identification of the type of virus as a coronavirus. Its RNA genome provides a way to explore its evolutionary links to other coronaviruses. Culture of the virus (within a laboratory setting) was performed confirming the ability of the virus to infect and replicate in human cells. Cell culture studies all demonstrated that the virus is able to cause damage to human cells (called the cytopathogenic effect or CPE).Released under the Official Information Act 1982Appendix One Virus that is grown in culture is able to infect animals and cause disease. Koch's Postulates Approximately 200 years ago, a German physician named Robert Koch proposed that four conditions were required to demonstrate the causal relationship between a particular microorganism and disease. These became known as Koch's postulates, which are as follows: 1. The microorganism must be found in diseased but not healthy individuals; 2. The microorganism must be cultured from the diseased individual; 3. Inoculation of a healthy individual with the cultured microorganism must recapitulated the disease; and finally 4. The microorganism must be re -isolated from the inoculated, diseased individual and matched to the original microorganism. These criteria were further updated in 1937 by Rivers for viral diseases to allow for the fact that viruses are unable to survive without a host [1]. 1. Regarding the first postulate, the concept of an infectious agent has markedly changed over the last 100+ years. In particular it is increasingly recognised that different individuals will have different responses to a particular micro-organism. While some people develop a life threating illness, others will remain without symptoms from a given illness. Koch himself recognised that there were asymptomatic cases of cholera. The risk of becoming ill from a particular microorganism then becomes a matter of probabilities, not an \"all or none\" phenomenon, as originally implied in Koch 's postulates. Although not all individuals will develop symptoms of COVID- 19, any individual infected with SARS -CoV- 2 (asymptomatic or not) is able to pass the virus on to other individuals. Released under the Official Information Act 1982Appendix One2. Most viruses can be cultured in specifically designed lab oratory 'medium' that promotes their growth. Because viruses require a host cells to grow and reproduce, the type of cell required for culture will vary. However, viruses are not always easy to grow in culture and therefore to identify the presence of viru s other means may be used which are more rapid, reliable and cost -effective. In particular, genetic tests are often used to identify sections of RNA which are unique to a specific virus. 3. The inoculation of a potentially deadly virus into healthy individuals is unnecessary to identify a particular virus as the cause of a disease. This step in Koch's postulates is usually determined by the observation of natural infection in groups of individuals, in cell culture or in animals. However, human challenge studie s are being undertaken in young health individuals in order to accelerate the development of vaccines [2] and fulfils the third postulate. 4. The identification of the same virus in groups of infected individuals (clusters), as identified by genomic testing validates this point. Supporting information/evidence [1] Rivers TM.

N g mihi Coral Hair Manager Democracy Services WiSSeNSCHAFFtPLUS magazin 4/2020 \u00b7 extract 1 WiSSeNSCHAFFtPLUS magazin 4/2020 \u00b7 extract 2 The causers of the corona crisis are clearly identified Virologists who claim disease-causing viruses are science fraudsters and must be prosecuted from Dr. Stefan Lanka Summary Science and scientificness are important instruments that help to identify and solve challenges. Science has very clear rules: Whoever makes claims must prove them clearly, comprehensibly and verifiably. Only statements that are verifiable may be called scientific, everything else falls within the realm of faith. The facts of faith must not be presented as scientifically proven facts in order to derive or justify governmental measures. Scientific statements must be refutable, falsifiable in order to be allowed to claim them as scientific facts. The first and written duty of every scientist is to strictly check his own statements, to try to refute them. Only in the case that this refutation is not successful a nd this failure is clearly documented by control experiments, a statement may be called scientific. All corona measures issued by governments and subordinate authorities are ultimately regulated by law, in Germany the Infection Protection Act (IfSG), but are only seemingly legitimized by it and not justified. With \u00a7 1 ifSG, for example, the target provision \"scientifically\" subjects all participants in Germany to the rules of science. The most important rule of science is the documented and unsuccessful attempt to prove the statement that is presented as true and scientific. All scientific rules are preceded by adherence to the laws of thought and logic. If these are disregarded or violated, the scientific statement is disproved as well as by a successful control experiment. The meaning and choice of words in all publications on all pathogenic viruses proves that the virologists not only violated the laws of thought, logic and binding rules of science, but also refuted the existence claims about pathogenic viruses themselves. If one has taken off the hypnotic anxiety glasses and reads objectively with reason what the authors do and write, every interested person who is able to read English and has acquired knowledge of the methods used will find out that these virologists (except those who work with phages and the phage-like viruses) misinterpret normal gene sequences as vital components and thus have disproved their whole field of expertise. This is particularly easy to see in the case of the assertions of the existence of the alleged SArS- CoV-2 virus. Since these virologists have clearly violated the laws of thought, logic and the rules of scientific work with their statements and by their actions, they can be colloquially described as science cheats. But since science fraud does not occur in criminal law and there are no precedents for it, I suggest and will do this myself, to have the employment fraud of virologists - pretending to be scientific but acting and arguing anti- scientifically - established in court and in criminal law. The responsible governmental authorities are called upon to prosecute these anti-scientific employment fraudsters in order to prevent them from doing anti-scientific and, as a consequence, anti-social and dangerous things. From the moment that a first court of law establishes the facts outlined below and convicts the first virologist of employment fraud, the end of the corona crisis will be heralded and sealed by the court and the global corona crisis will turn out to be an opportunity for all. WiSSeNSCHAFFtPLUS magazin 4/2020 \u00b7 extract 3 Introduction Humanity is facing a great challenge: The inherent dynamics and consequences of fear and anti-biosis through the discipline of biology and medicine, disturb and destroy the environment, plants, animals, people and the economy. The corona crisis is only the visible tip of an iceberg on a collision course with everyone and everything. One of the reasons for this challenge is materialism, the attempt to explain life by purely material models. Our materialism of today was invented in \"post-socratic\" antiquity as an explicit counter-reaction to fear and abuse of power by religions. This is a comprehensible, human and humanitarian motivated action, but it has dramatic consequences. This materialism has produced the taught good-evil -biology, the \"prevailing opinion \" in medicine based on it and the resulting anti-biosis (antibiotics, radiation, chemotherapy, disinfection, restriction of basic rights, vaccination, lock-down, qua- rantain, social distancing etc.). more and more people, environment and economy are harmed by this ideology. Their materialistic good-evil theory, which has no actual basis but is based on disproved assumptions, developed unrecognized into the most powerful religion. The materialistic theory of life states that there are only atoms, but no con sciousness, no spiritual forces and no animator who could have created them and set them in motion. In order to be able to explain the cosmos and life in a purely material way, our \"science\" is forced to assert a huge bang, in which all atoms were created out of nothing, which flew apart. Some atoms would touch each other by chance and form molecules. These molecules had formed a primordial cell by accidental coming together, from which all further life had developed by struggle and selection. All this is said to have happened in unimaginable lengths of time in the distant past, and is therefore not subject to scientific examination and must therefore not be called scientific. For a better, real and experimentally accessible view of life, I refer to the very substance of which life consists. It is the elementary substance of which the membrane consists, the so-called surface tension membrane of water, which water forms wherever it has contact with other substances or with itself in motion and vortexes. Aristotle called this substance ether and Dr. Peter Augustin rediscovered it in the form of the primary substance. Japanese plant physiologists referred to this substance as pi-water. This knowledge and point of view resulting from the knowledge of the ether/primordial substance also lets the pre-Socratic principle revive, become conceivable and imaginable: Thinking in the atomic theory makes this kind of imagination and imaginary worlds more difficult or prevents it and, if no other ways of thinking are known or are frowned upon, forces false assumptions. The entire academic world of biology and medicine is based on such a false assumption. in 1848, when constructive effects of the French Revolution had a chance to unfold in Germany, the attempts at change failed and caused a dramatic hardening and deterioration of political and social life. While in 1848 the man who was responsible for the current development of biology and medicine still advocated humane, logical and correct measures for the \"prevention of epidemics\", in the following ten years he adapted to the hardening and increasingly extreme political conditions. It was Rudolf Virchow who, in 1858, without any scientific basis, but exclusively based on the Atomic Theory of Democritus and Epicurus, postulated the Cellular Theory of life and all diseases: Cellular Pathology. throughout his life, Rudolf Virchow suppressed \"relevant facts\" of embryology and tissue science in order to present and popularize his new cell theory as something real. However, this knowledge of embryology and tissue theory, the WiSSeNSCHAFFtPLUS magazin 4/2020 \u00b7 extract 4 germ theory of life, is an indispensable prerequisite for understanding life, its development and, above all, diseases, cures, healing crises and obstacles to healing. Rudolf Virchow claimed, analogous to the Atomic Theory, that all life originates from a cell.The cell was the smallest, indivisible unit of life, which at the same time, however, would cause all diseases by the formation of alleged disease toxins, Latin virus. This laid the foundation on which the theories of genes, infections, immunity and cancer had to develop in order to be able to explain the processes of life, illness and healing within this theory. If it is believed because it is taught that all processes are only caused by material interactions and that all life originates from one cell, the followers of this view are forced to adopt a construction and function plan of life, i.e. a hereditary substance, and to assert that it exists. The same logic of compulsion results for the claimed poisons of diseases. If the cell allegedly produces virus=disease toxins as the cause of disease in order to distribute them inside and outside the body, a place in an individual must be claimed where and in which this disease toxin, the virus, was first produced. If this way of thinking is elevated to a dogma, on the other hand, nothing else may be taught, and if its views are defamed as unscientific or as a conspiracy against the state, it excludes from the outset purely other ways of thinking and imagining the development of diseases within a body or in a group of people. This logic of compulsion always seeks the causes only in the categories of material defects or material malice. It is not mentioned that the idea of the virus as a poison was elegantly and scientifically disproved and abandoned in 1951 and that since 1952 another idea had to be invented: The idea that viruses are a collection of dangerous genes. Here again, it is concealed that there is still no solid scientific proof for the assumption of such gene accumulations, which could be called viruses. The good news is that the new genetic virology, which had experienced its upswing from 1954 onwards, has disproved itself by its own statements, in a truly scientific way, i.e. easily comprehensible and verifiable. This statement is 100% correct, proven and I stand up for this statement as a virologist, as a scientist, as a citizen and as a human being. The transition from toxin virology to today's genetic virology The idea of disease toxins is still quite effective, since dangerous bacterial protein toxins are still claimed to be dangerous. Or bacteria, such as the corkscrew bacteria, which are claimed to be dangerous and which would allegedly bore from the suspected point of entry via the nerves into the brain. What virologists, physicians and science journalists are keeping quiet about is the fact that the idea that viruses were defined as protein toxins, which was valid until 1951, had to be abandoned that year. In order to test the assumption and assertion of toxin-viruses and to be allowed to claim them as scientific, two control experiments were conducted: 1. Healthy tissue was exposed to decomposition and not just tissue supposedly damaged by viruses. It was found that the proteins produced by the decomposition of healthy tissue are the same as those produced by the decomposition of \"virus -damaged\" tissue. This refuted the virus assumption. 2. the protein-toxin-virus assumption was additionally disproved by the fact that in the electron microscope of \"virus diseased\" humans, animals and their fluids never anything else could be found and photographed than it was the case with healthy humans. By the way, this has remained so until today. The clinical, i.e. medical virology disproved itself with these successful control experiments and gave up with words of regret, which was only noticed by attentive readers of professional journals. This fact was suppressed by the mass media because the hypnotists of power celebrated the ongoing vaccination campaigns. WiSSeNSCHAFFtPLUS magazin 4/2020 \u00b7 extract 5 Although the viruses were lost as a justification for vaccination, the vaccination campaigns were not interrupted - also because of the silence of the health authorities and \"science\". After the abandonment of virology, biology and medicine could not find any other explanation within the purely material cell theory for the diseases and phenomena of simultaneous or increased occurrence of diseases defined as viral. The participants were thus forced to invent a new theory of what viruses should be in the future. They geared themselves to actually existing structures, which are called phages and are formed by bacteria when they are removed from their environment and the exchange with other bacteria and microbes is prevented. As a young student I was fortunate to isolate such a phage-like structure from the sea, to study its structure, composition and interaction with the environment. This led me directly into the field of virology, as I believed unsuspectingly that I had discovered a harmless virus and a stable virus-host relationship to research the origin of viruses. Thirty years later, new structures of what are now called \"giant viruses\" have been and are being discovered all the time. In the meantime, it has been clearly proven that they are at the beginning of the processes with which biological life begins or becomes visible to us. French virologists recognize that these structures form the fourth kingdom of life, next to the primordial bacteria, the bacteria and the eukaryotes. The structures erroneously called phages, i.e. bacteria eaters and giant viruses, can also be described as a type of spores that bacteria and simply organized living beings form when their living conditions change in such a way that they can no longer reproduce or survive ideally. Depending on the species, these helpful structures always consist of a strand of the so-called hereditary substance DNA of exactly the same length and exactly the same composition. This type of DNA is always surrounded by a shell of the dense substance from which biological life originates. This is the reason why \"phages\" and \"giant viruses\" - let us better call them bionts - are easy to isolate i.e. to enrich and separate from all other components of life. in this isolated form they can and are regularly biochemically analyzed. Each biochemical characterization reveals that the nucleic acid of a type of \"phage\" or \"giant virus\" always has exactly the same length and always exactly the same composition. In fact, for decades, phages were the only source of pure nucleic acid (DNA) in biochemical studies. The process of absorption and release of DNA into and out of bacteria, documented under the electron microscope, was interpreted as an infection. It has been claimed without any proof that phages attack bacteria, rape them, force their nucleic acids on them and that the bacteria die because of this. Only bacteria that are extremely inbred, i.e. constantly reproduced without having contact to other bacteria or microbes, are transformed into phages in an act of metamorphosis. This transformation is misinterpreted as the death of the bacteria by phages. On the other hand, bacteria that are freshly isolated from their environment never transform into phage and do not die if phage is applied in whatever amounts. This is also the reason why the often cited phage therapy as a substitute for antibiotics, for example to suppress pain and other symptoms - as with any other poisoning - can and will never work with \"phages\" in the desired sense and to the desired extent. Biology of phages and giant viruses and the resulting refutation of the cell theory of life This is the situation with the algae (ectocarpus siliculosus), from which I isolated their \"giant viruses\": The mobile forms of the algae, the gametes and spores, search for the \"giant viruses\" in their environment with their mobile flagella and absorb these \"giant viruses\". The WiSSeNSCHAFFtPLUS magazin 4/2020 \u00b7 extract 6 growing algae integrate the nucleic acid of the \"giant viruses\" into their own chromosomes. It was observed that algae with \"giant viruses\" are better off than those without. It has never been observed that algae with \"giant viruses\" are worse off than those without. New and more and more amazing \"giant viruses\" with more and more amazing properties are constantly being found and more and more evidence is being created that bacteria and micro-organisms, amoebae and unicellular organisms are created from \"giant viruses\" into which they are transformed as if their living conditions no longer existed. Giant viruses are apparently created by and around nucleic acids, which develop catalytic activities, i.e. they release energy independently, synthesize further nucleic acids, other molecules and substances and thereby constantly generate new properties and abilities. The particularly reactive and diverse nucleic acid forms of RNA, keyword \"The RNA world\", which can easily and constantly transform into DNA and retransform back into DNA, are also created in the process of self-organization of life, without any scientifically ascertainable reason or cause.With the discovery of phage, which is only ever created by the transformation of extremely inbred (inc est-) bacterial cultures, and giant viruses, which maintain themselves, enlarge and actively metabolise themselves, and the discovery of new organisms consisting of giant viruses, three things have been proven so far: i. The cell theory that biological life exists only in the form of cells and arises only from cells has been disproved. ii. The assertion that biological life originated in grey primeval times has been refuted. Life constantly arises anew and before our eyes, if we only look at life objectively and restricted by no dogmas and unfounded theories. It is proven that biological life as we know it now can arise wherever there is water and perhaps also conditions that are the same or similar to those on our mother planet earth. iii. The negative interpretation that the uptake of nucleic acids from \"phages\" and \"giant viruses\" into other organisms has been interpreted as infection and as harmful is disproved. This observation, however, was the reason to believe from 1952 onwards that there were genetic viruses in humans that caused diseases by transmitting their \"dangerous\" nucleic acids and can be held responsible for death and destruction. To this day, no virus has been seen in or isolated from humans, animals, nor plants or their fluids. It has not even been possible to isolate a nucleic acid that would correspond to the length and composition of the genetic strands of the claimed disease causing viruses, although the isolation, presentation and analysis of the composition of nucleic acids of this length has long been possible using the simplest standard techniques. A nobel prize and its fatal consequences in isolated form, \"phages\" and \"giant viruses\" (bionts) can be quickly and easily photographed in large numbers in the electron microscope and their degree of purity documented. The isolation and photography of isolated and characterized structures has never been successful with any of the alleged pathogenic viruses! Bionts (alias phages and giant viruses) are regularly seen and photographed in large numbers under the electron microscope in the organisms through which they are produced or which produce them (sic!). On the other hand, the photography of structures in the electron microscope, which ar e claimed to be disease-causing viruses, has not been successfully documented in any human being, animal, plant or in liquids from them, such as blood, semen, saliva etc., to date! Why is this not the case? The electron microscopic images of alleged viruses show only structures that are always WiSSeNSCHAFFtPLUS magazin 4/2020 \u00b7 extract 7 obtained from completely different sources. These structures have never been isolated, neither biochemically characterized nor used as a source for the short pieces of nucleic acids, from which virologists ONLY THEORETICALLY construct a long nucleic acid, which is then passed off as the alleged genetic strand of a virus. From all types of \"phages\" and \"giant viruses\", nucleic acids of exactly the same length and exactly the same composition can be obtained. Never before has it been possible to isolate a nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) from a structure or from a liquid whose length and composition would correspond to what virologists claim to be the genetic strand of a disease-causing virus. Why and for what reason the virologists have completely lost themselves in an anti-scientific approach that is completely removed from reality and dangerous becomes clear through the sequence of what happened between 1951 and December 10, 1954. After medical virology had been taken care of by control experiments in 1951, the phages of bacteria became the model for the persistent ideology of what \"pathogenic viruses\" should look like: a nucleic acid of a certain length and composition, surrounded by a shell consisting of a certain number of certain proteins. But: lack of electron microscopic pictures of \"disease-causing viruses\" in humans/animals/plants, lack of electron microscopic pictures of \"disease-causing viruses\" in isolated form, lack of biochemical characterization of the components of \"disease-causing viruses\", Due to the lack of isolation, virologists have been and still are forced to assemble individual components of supposedly \"virally\" diseased tissue into viruses in their thoughts and graphics and to fake these intellectual products for themselves and the public as existing viruses! ! The virologists who claim that viruses cause illness refer centrally to a single publication with which they justify what they do and pass it off as scientific. This is easily recognized as insane and anti-scientific. The authors, who published these considerations on June 1, 1954, have explicitly described their observations as speculations that have been refuted in themselves and that will only be verified in the future. To this day, this future verification has not taken place, because the first author of this study, Prof. John Franklin Enders, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine on December 10, 1954. He received the Nobel Prize for another speculation within the old, in 1951 disproved \"Viruses are dangerous protein-toxins\" theory. The Nobel Prize had two effects: The old, disproved toxin- virus-theory got a pseudo-scientific nimbus and the new gene-virology the highest, apparently scientific honor. The new genetic virology from 1952 onward had two central basic principles: viruses that cause disease are in principle structured like phages and they would be created when cells die in the test tube after supposedly infected sample material is added to them. Enders and his colleagues, with their only publication from June 1, 1954, developed the idea that cells that die in the test tube after supposedly infected material is added would turn into viruses. This dying is simultaneously issued as isolation of the virus - because supposedly something is brought into the laboratory from outside -, and the reproduction of the suspected virus and the dying cell mass is used as a vaccine. Enders, his colleagues and all virologists overlooked - because of the Nobel Prize's blindness - that the death of the cells in the laboratory is not caused by a virus, but because the cells are unintentionally and unnoticed but systematically killed in the laboratory.By poisoning with cell-toxic antibiotics, by extreme starvation by means of withdrawal of the nutrient solution and by the addition of decomposing proteins, which release toxic metabolic products. WiSSeNSCHAFFtPLUS magazin 4/2020 \u00b7 extract 8 Components from such cells dying in the laboratory are still today mentally combined to a virus and presented as reality. The virology of disease-causing viruses is as simple as this. Enders and the \"virologists\" have never, until today, carried out control experiments to \"infect\" the cells in the laboratory with sterile material. They die in the control experiment in exactly the same way as with supposedly \"viral\" material. Short, clear and easily comprehensible explanation of the claims of all viruses that cause illness Error and self-deception are human, comprehens ible and excusable. What is not excusable are the constant claims of virologists that their statements and their actions are scientific. That is clearly wrong, easily provable and comprehensible for everyone. Therefore the virologists who claim corona viruses or other pathogenic viruses are to be called employment fraudsters and prosecuted by legal means so that they retract their false, disproved and dangerous statements. Thus, the Corona crisis and other \"viral\" disasters with resulting deadly consequence s such as \"AIDS\", Ebola\" and other unfounded \"viral\" pandemics can and will not only be stopped, prevented in the future, but turned into an opportunity for all. The definition of what can be called a scientific statement and the resulting obligations are clearly defined. Summarized: A. Every scientific statement must be verifiable, comprehensible and refutable. B. Only if the refutation of a scientific statement by laws of thought, logic and, if applicable, by control experiments has not succeeded, a statement may be called scientific. C. Every scientist is obliged to check and question his statements himself. Because virologists have never done this themselves and for understandable reasons are reluctant to do so - who wants to refute themselves, who wants to refute their actions, who wants to refute their own reputation - we do this publicly with seven arguments. Every single argument alone is sufficient to refute the existence claims of all \"pathogenic viruses\" and this is what virologists of this discipline do (except for researchers who deal with the existing \"phages\" and \"giant viruses\"). in the following points the word \"virus\" is used instead of the word combination \"pathogenic virus\". 1. The fact of Alignment Virologists have never isolated a complete genetic strand of a virus and displayed it directly, in its entire length. They always use very short pieces of nucleic acids, whose sequence consists of four molecules to determine them and call them sequences. From a multitude of millions of such specific, very short sequences, virologists mentally assemble a fictitious long genome strand with the help of complex computational and statistical methods. This process is called alignment. The result of this complex alignment, the fictitious and very long genetic strand, is presented by virologists as the core of a virus and they claim to have thus proven the existence of a virus. However, such a complete strand never appears in reality and in scientific literature as a whole, although the simplest standard techniques have long been available to determine the length and composition of nucleic acids simply and directly. By the fact of the alignment, instead of presenting a nucleic acid of the appropriate length directly, the virologists have disproved themselves. WiSSeNSCHAFFtPLUS magazin 4/2020 \u00b7 extract 9 2. The fact of the lack of control experiments for alignment Virologists have never performed and documented an alignment using equally short nucleic acids from control experiments.To do this, they MUST isolate the short nucleic acids from the exact same cell culture procedure, with the difference that the suspected \"infection\" does not occur by adding supposedly \"infected\" samples, but with sterile materials or sterilized samples that have been \"control-infected\". These logical and mandatory control experiments have never been performed and documented.The virologists alone have thus proven that their statements have no scientific value and must NOT be passed off as scientific statements. 3. Alignment is only done by means of mental constructs In order to be able to mentally/computationally assemble the very short sequences of the nucleic acids used into a long genome, the virologists need a template to align the short sequences into a very long, supposedly viral genome strand. Without such a given, very long sequence, it is not possible for a virologist to construct a viral genome theoretically/computationally. Virologists argue that the constructed genome is from a virus because the alignment was done with another, given viral genome. This argument of the virologists is briefly and unambiguously refuted by the fact that all templates with which new genetic material strands were generated theoretically/computationally were themselves and finally generated theoretically/computationally and do not originate from a virus. 4. Viruses have never been seen in a human/animal/plant or in liquids thereof Virologists claim that infectious, i.e. intact viruses are supposed to be present in large numbers in blood and saliva. That is why, for example, in the Corona crisis, all people wear a mask. To date, however, not a single virus has been photographed in saliva, blood or other places in human/animal/plant or fluids, although electron microscopic imaging is now an easy and routine standard technique. This unambiguous and easily verifiable fact alone, that there are no images of viruses in human/animal/plant or liquids from it, disproves all virus allegations. something that has never been seen in human/animal/plant or liquids from it must not be given as a scientifically proven fact. 5.The composition of the structures that are claimed to be viruses has never been biochemically characterized There are two different techniques that virologists use to create photos of alleged viruses. For transmission electron microscopy, they use cell cultures which they embed in synthetic resin, scrape into thin layers and look through. Particles that they show in such images have never been isolated and their composition has never been biochemically determined. After all, all proteins and the long genome strand that is attributed to the viruses would have to be found. Neither that, nor the isolation of such embedded particles and the biochemical characterization of their composition appear in a single publication by virologists. This refutes the virologists' claim that such recordings are viruses. WiSSeNSCHAFFtPLUS magazin 4/2020 \u00b7 extract 10 The other method used by virologists to photograph viruses under the electron microscope is the simple and fast observation electron microscopy known as negative staining. In order to concentrate actually existing structures, such as \"phages\" and \"giant viruses\", and to separate them from all other components, which is then called \"isolation\", a standard technique is used, the density-gradient centrifugation. The visibility of presence, appearance and purity of these isolated structures in the electron microscope is achieved by coating these particles with a metal-containing substance and making the underlying structures appear as shadows in the electron beam. The other part of the isolated particles, which were made visible by \"negative staining\", is biochemically characterized. In the case of all phages and giant viruses, the nucleic acids are always found to be intact, always the same, always very long and composed in the same way and the results of the biochemical characterization are documented. in the case of all viruses, which are issued as viruses by means of this technique, the \"negative staining\", the following has been done. These particles are not enriched, purified and isolated by the density-gradient centrifugation provided for this purpose, but sedimented by simple centrifugation on the bottom of the centrifuge tube, which is called \"pelleting\" and then observed under the electron microscope. The composition of such structures, which are presented as viruses, has never been determined biochemically until today. With this easily verifiable and comprehensible statement based on all publications of virologists, in which structures are identified as viruses by means of the electron microscope, the virologists have also disproved this argument of the existence of viruses in a simple and elegant way - without noticing it. 6. Electron microscopic images, which are output a s viruses, are known typical artifacts or cell - specific structures Virologists publish a large number of electron microscopic images of structures that they pass off as viruses. They do not mention the fact that ALL of these images are typical structures of dying cell cultures or are laboratory-produced protein-fat soap bubbles and have never been photographed in human/animal/plant or liquids from them. Researchers other than virologists refer to the same structures that virologists present as viruses as either typical cell components such as villi (amoeba-like protuberances with which cells cling to the surface and move around), exosomes or \"virus -like particles\". This is a further, independent proof that the virologists' statements that viruses can be seen under the electron microscope have been scientifically disproved. 7. the animal experiments of the virologists refute the virus- existence assertions Virologists carry out animal experiments to prove that the substances they work with are viruses and can cause diseases. It is clear from every single publication in which such animal experiments have been conducted that the way the animals are treated produces exactly the symptoms that are claimed to be caused by the virus. In each of these publications, it is clear that no control experiments have been performed where the animals would have been treated in the same way with sterilized starting material. These two openly stated facts refute the virologists who claim that they detected the WiSSeNSCHAFFtPLUS magazin 4/2020 \u00b7 extract 11 presence and effect of viruses in animal experiments. Concluding remark Now, in order to end the Corona crisis and turn it into an opportunity for all, it is necessary to make these clear, easily comprehensible and verifiable refutations of the virology public and effective.These refutations become effective, for example, when the appropriate legal remedies against virologists are applied in the judiciary and the results are made public. These refutations become effective, for example, when the appropriate legal remedies against virologists are applied in the judiciary and the results are made public. We will inform you via our WissenschafftPlus mailing list when we have results that are ready for decision. I guarantee with my name that anyone who wants to check these statements on any \"disease-causing virus\" will come to exactly the same conclusions if he/she is able to read the methods. Precautionary note: As long as the corona crisis continues, my colleagues and I will only answer inquiries regarding alleged so-called corona and measles viruses. For inquiries about all other \"viruses\", I refer during the Corona period to the articles on this subject published in the magazine WissenschafftPlus since 2003. Please do not only keep in mind that the decision in the measles trial, which was confirmed by the highest court of law, has deprived the entire virology of its basis. It has been established by a court of law and is therefore part of the German jurisdiction that the publication of the central method of virology from June 1, 1954, in which the unintentional and unnoticed killing of cells in the laboratory was published as proof of the existence of disease-causing viruses, no longer constitutes proof of the existence of a virus from the year 2016! The Corona crisis has increased the chance that the origins of the measles virus process alone can bring about the turnaround from the good-evil thinking and acting that dominates biology, medicine, society and the state today. In my opinion, the application of one, several or all seven of the above-mentioned arguments to SArS-CoV-2 may be enough to end the predictable dynamics of the global corona hysteria and the business dealings that are greasing it with tests and vaccines. Here you can find a very good summary of the facts about the importance of the measles virus process and also other texts that are very good. My optimism that the Corona crisis will prove to be a chance for everyone is based in \u00a7 1 of the infection protection laws, abbreviated ifSg. in \u00a7 1 ifSg \"Purpose of the law\" is stated in sentence (2): \"The necessary cooperation and collaboration of federal, state and local authorities, doctors, veterinarians, hospitals, scientific institutions and other parties involv ed shall be designed and supported in accordance with the current state of medical and epidemiological science and technology. The personal responsibility of the owners and managers of community facilities, food processing plants, health care facilities and individuals in the prevention of communicable diseases is to be clarified and promoted. All corona measures and ordinances, including corona laws, are based exclusively and solely on the German Infection Protection Act (IfSg). However, since the \"target provision in \u00a7 1 ifSg \"is to be designed and supported according to the current state of medical and epidemiological science and technology\" has been refuted and proven anti-scientific by the published statements of the virologists themselves, all corona measures, regulations and ordinances lack the legal basis to be applied. None of the institutions and managers of community facilities, food processing plants, health care facilities and individuals mentioned in \u00a7 1, sentence (2), i.e. every WiSSeNSCHAFFtPLUS magazin 4/2020 \u00b7 extract 12 citizen who is addressed by law, may carry out and tolerate corona measures and regulations if they have recognized and can prove that virologists have no scientific evidence for the existence of disease-causing viruses, but have disproved themselves through their own actions and publications. As long as the obligation to scientificity in \u00a7 1 ifSg is maintained, it is possible with reference to \u00a7 1 ifSg to present before courts the evidence of the groundlessness, lack of rights, harmfulness and immorality of all corona measures, regulations and laws with success. The majority of the judges are honest and conscientious, following the law, because otherwise an open dictatorship would have been ruling this country for a long time, which wants to build up an ever more visib le, pseudo-scientific and disproved virology and medicine. Please keep the following in mind: The majority of the population believes in the existence, the effects of disease-causing viruses and in the positive effects of vaccines. To put it very drastically: Those who believe in cancer as the effect of a misunderstood principle of evil also believe in metastases, believe in \"flying metastases\", alias viruses. The directly and indirectly experienced suffering of almost every human being with the negative consequences of cancer diagnoses and their severe treatments is profound and effective. Please take into account that only this direct and indirect experience of suffering has created and strengthened the feeling and certainty in people that there are dangerous and deadly diseases and viruses. Please note that from such and other experiences the view can result that only our state and its specialists are able to deal with it and are allowed to handle it. In this way you can avoid that your actions have the opposite effect. This is especially important when dealing with doctors, which we all need. I, for example, explain to every questioning person that there is a better system of knowledge that (in a positive sense) scientifically explains those processes that lead to illnesses and healing and that healing crises can occur and healing obstacles can work. In order to be able to accept this new view, however, it is often a prerequisite that the previous system of explanation based on the doctrine of the cells is recognized as refuted. The Corona crisis is a unique opportunity and a clear call to stand up for life and the three universal human ideals of freedom, equality and fraternity, i.e. the social threefold division of human communities.

Any notification within the meaning of the Statute of the Court addressed in this way will be considered valid. Mr Prosecutor, 1This communication and complaint is provided to the office of the Prosecutor pursuant to the United Kingdom's accession to the International Criminal Court's Rome Statute deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations on October 4, 2000. 22We have tried to raise this case through the local English police and the English Court system without success, we have been unable to even get the case registered either with the police or with the court after several attempts. The statute for the ICC declares that \"The ICC is intended to complement, not to replace, national criminal systems; it prosecutes cases only when a State is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution (Article 17(1)(a)). This is such a case which is why we are addressing the ICC directly. A. BACKGROUND 3The Corona virus 'vaccines' are an innovative medical treatment, which have only received temporary Authorisation under Regulation 174 of the Human Medicine Regulations Act (2012). The long-term effects and safety of the treatment in recipients are unknown. It is important to note that the Corona Virus 'vaccines' are the world's first introduction to the synthetic m-RNA technology and all previous immunisations worked in a totally different manner, by way of introducing a deactivated or weakened virus to the body to trigger a natural arousal of the immune system against it. As detailed by Dr Mike Yeadon, the risks anticipated by this innovative medical treatment are hereby enclosed as Appendix 1 to this request. 4All Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trials are ongoing and not due to conclude until late 2022/early 2023. The vaccines are, therefore, currently experimental with only limited short- term and no long-term adult safety data available. In addition, they are using a completely new mRNA vaccine technology, which has never previously been approved for use in humans. The mRNA is effectively a pro-drug and it is not known how much spike protein any individual will produce. Potential late-onset effects can take months or years to become apparent. The limited children's trials undertaken to date are totally underpowered to rule out uncommon but severe side effects. 5The Covid-19 'vaccines' do not meet the requirements to be categorised as vaccines and are in fact gene therapy (Appendix 8). The Merriam-Webster dictionary quietly changed the definition of the term 'vaccine' to include components of the COVID-19 m-RNA injection. The definition of vaccine was specifically changed due to the Covid-19 injection on February 5th 2021. Dr Mike Yeadon, joint applicant on this request, asserts that claims calling the Covid-19 injections a 'vaccine is public manipulation and misrepresentation of clinical 3treatment. It's not a vaccination. It's not prohibiting infection. It's not a prohibiting transmission device. It's a means by which your body is conscripted to make the toxin that then allegedly your body somehow gets used to dealing with it, but unlike a vaccine, which is to trigger the immune response, this is to trigger the creation of the toxin.' MRNA uses the cell's machinery to synthesize proteins that are supposed to resemble the SPIKE protein of the virus, which is what it uses to enter cells via the ACE2 receptor. These proteins are then identified by the immune system, which builds antibodies against them. The real concern is that these proteins could accumulate in the body especially in regions of high concentration of ACE2 receptors, such as the gonads. If the immune system then attacks the location where they accumulate, then you could be dealing with an auto-immune condition. 6PCR Tests A review from the University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (Appendix 2) found that the standard PRC test is so sensitive, that it can detect old infections by picking up fragments of dead viral cells. Originally developed to detect the presence of DNA and RNA in biological samples, even its Nobel Prize-winning inventor Kary Mullis declared that PCR was never intended to diagnose a disease. It simply detects the presence of specific genetic material, which may or may not indicate infection. As Dr. Kary Mullis put it, the PCR technique can find almost anything in anybody. The PCR test uses amplification cycles to find viral RNA. The sample is repeatedly chemically amplified to increase the RNA copies until they can be detected. Each \"cycle\" of amplification doubles the number of molecules in a sample. If you run enough cycles, you can effectively find a single molecule of any substance. Public Health England (PHE) policy confirms that the cycle threshold should be set around 25.6 and if the machine must run more than 25 to 35 cycles (Appendix 2a) to get the sample to the test's Limit of Detection, there isn't enough virus in the sample to matter clinically. 4(Appendix 2a) We have information from freedom of information requests that as many as 40-45 cycles are being carried out (Appendix 3, 3a, 3b, 3c) which is too many because it increases the chance of a positive result even without coronavirus RNA being present in the original sample - hence the 'asymptomatic' individuals. In addition to being completely unreliable the PCR tests also contain carcinogenic ethylene oxide. (Appendix 48) 7Covid is a biological weapon - Gain of function research Chinese Virologist Li-Meng Yan was among the first researchers to study covid-19 in China after she was enlisted to investigate the origin of the virus by superior Leo Poon. Dr Li-Meng Yan and her team published a report (Appendix 4) claiming that the novel coronavirus was developed \"as a laboratory product created by using bat coronaviruses ZC45 and/or ZXC21 as a template and/or backbone.\" The report states that \"ZC45 and ZXC21 were discovered between July 2015 and February 2017 and isolated and characterized by the aforementioned military research laboratories.\" It also says that when a non-military lab, the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre, published a Nature article reporting \"a conflicting close phylogenetic relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and ZC45/ZXC2 rather than with RaTG13, was quickly shut down for 'rectification.'\" The report also accuses several publications of bowing to 5political pressure or of experiencing \"conflicts of interest\" so as not to publish findings that differ from the natural origin theory. \"The existing scientific publications supporting a natural origin theory rely heavily on a single piece of evidence - a previously discovered bat coronavirus named RaTG13, which shares a 96% nucleotide sequence identity with SARS- CoV-2,\". 8The National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the USA has admitted to funding of gain of function research on bat coronaviruses at China's Wuhan lab - despite Dr Anthony Fauci repeatedly denying this. In a letter to Republican James Comer (Appendix 5), NIH's principal deputy director A. Tabak, blamed EcoHealth Alliance - that funnelled US funds to the Wuhan lab - for not being transparent about the work it was doing. British scientist Peter Daszak who runs EcoHealth is accused by Tabak of failing to comply with the terms of the grant. As recently as November 2021 Fauci was accused of lying about gain of function research after documents obtained by the intercept (Appendix 6) detailed grants given to EcoHealth Alliance for bat coronavirus studies. The $3.1 million grant was awarded for a five-year period between 2014 and 2019. After the funding was renewed in 2019, it was suspended by the trump administration in April 2020. The grant directed $599,000 to the Wuhan institute of Virology for bat coronavirus research. 9British Professor Angus Dalgleish and Norwegian scientist Dr. Birger S\u00f8rensen, published a report in the Quarterly Review of Biophysics (Appendix 7) and claim that the coronavirus's spike protein contains sequences that appear to be artificially inserted. They claim they had 'prima facie evidence of retro-engineering in China ' for a year - but were ignored by academics and major journals. Dalgleish is a professor of oncology at St George's University, London, and is best known for his breakthrough creating the first working 'HIV vaccine', to treat diagnosed patients and allow them to go off medication for months. While analysing COVID-19 samples last year in an attempt to create a vaccine, Dalgleish and S\u00f8rensen discovered 'unique fingerprints' in the virus that they say could only have arisen from manipulation in a laboratory. They said they tried to publish their findings but were rejected by major scientific journals which were at the time resolute that the virus jumped naturally from bats or other animals to humans. Even when former MI6 chief Sir Richard Dearlove spoke out publicly saying the scientists' theory should be investigated, the idea was dismissed as 'fake news.' 610Graphene hydroxide Dr Andreas Noack is a German chemist and one of the EU's top graphene experts, carbon expert and doctored in the field of activated carbon whereby for his doctoral thesis he converted graphene oxide into graphene hydroxide. Professor Dr Pablo Campra comes from the university of Almeria, and alongside Dr Andreas Noack he examined the covid 'vaccines' for the presence of graphene oxide with the Micro-Raman Spectroscopy, the study of frequencies. According to both doctors, the vaccines don't contain graphene oxide but do contain graphene hydroxide. On November 23, 2021, Dr Andreas Noack released a video explaining what graphene hydroxide is and how the nano structures injected into the human body act as 'razor blades' inside the veins of 'vaccine' recipients. Dr Andreas goes on to explain how due to the nano size of the graphene oxide structures they would not show up on an autopsy as toxicologists can't imagine that there are structures that can cut up blood vessels causing people to bleed to death on the inside so they would not be looking for them, given their atomic size. 11On 18th November 2020 Dr Andreas Noack was on a 'livestream' on YouTube discussing the dangers of the Covid-19 'vaccines' when he was arrested on camera by armed German police (Appendix 41). On 26th November 2021, just hours after publishing his latest video about graphene oxide and graphene hydroxide (Appendix 42) he was attacked and murdered. 12We request a full investigation be done into the inclusion of Graphene hydroxide in the Covid-19 'vaccines' and into the assassination of Dr Andreas Noack. 13Inflated Covid figures The number of covid-19 cases have been artificially inflated due to the inaccuracy and unreliability of the PCR testing and the number Covid-19 deaths in the UK have been massively artificially inflated due to the fact that a covid death is recorded if an individual died for any reason within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test (that was confirmed with the inaccurate and unreliable PRC tests). These deaths are being recorded as Covid-19 regardless of whether Covid-19 was the factual cause of death. 14A Freedom of Information request (Appendix 43) shows us that between March and June 2020 the total number of Covid-19 related deaths in England and wales with no pre-existing health conditions was 4,476. 7(Appendix 43) 15However, the Covid-19 deaths for the same period were recorded at 49,607 (Appendix 44) 8 (Appendix 44) 16We submit that a further way that the Covid-19 statistics have been artificially inflated is by the 'rebranding' of the common influenza, pneumonia and other respiratory infections as covid -19. Epidemiologist Knut Wittowski, the former head of biostatistics, epidemiology and research design at Rockefeller University claims ' there may be quite a number of influenza cases included in the 'presumed Covid' category of people who have Covid symptoms (which influenza symptoms can be mistaken for), but are not tested for SARS RNA' . Those patients he argued, ' also may have some SARS RNA sitting in their nose while being infected with influenza, in which case the influenza would be 'confirmed' to be Covid'. 17Data from the ONS (Appendix 45) showed that deaths in 2018 from influenza and pneumonia amounted to 29,516 and in 2019, was 26,398. However, deaths in 2020 for influenza was recorded at just 394 and pneumonia at 13,619 (Appendix 46). 9(Appendi x 45) (Appendix46) 18John O'loony, a joint applicant on this request is a funeral director running his own funeral home in Milton Keynes. He has testified (Appendix 47) that as a funeral director he saw 'a massive effort made to deliberately inflate Covid death numbers. Cancer patients and stroke 10victims and even one guy that was run over all ended up with Covid on their death certificate'. 18aWe submit that the misrepresentation of covid cases and covid deaths warrants a full investigation by the Court. 19Ineffectiveness of masks The World Health Organisation (WHO) has admitted that there is no evidence available on the usefulness of masks to protect non-sick individuals (Appendix 9). In addition to hypoxia and hypercapnia, breathing through facemask residues bacterial and germ components on the inner and outside layer of the facemask. These toxic components are repeatedly breathed back into the body, causing self-contamination. Breathing through facemasks also increases temperature and humidity in the space between the mouth and the mask, resulting in a release of toxic particles from the mask's materials. A systematic literature review estimated that aerosol contamination levels of facemasks including 13 to 202,549 different viruses. Rebreathing contaminated air with high bacterial and toxic particle concentrations along with low O2 and high CO2 levels continuously challenge the body homeostasis ,causing self- toxicity and immunosuppression. (Appendix 10) 20Alternative treatments Dr. Peter McCullough is an internist, cardiologist, and professor of medicine at Texas A and M College of Medicine. He has completed his bachelor's degree at Baylor University and has completed his medical degree as an Alpha Omega Alpha graduate from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas. He also completed his internal medicine residency at the University of Washington in Seattle, his cardiology fellowship - including service as Chief Fellow - at William Beaumont Hospital, and his master's degree in public health at the University of Michigan. 21Hydroxychloroquine The most widely studied and utilized drug in all of COVID-19. It basically has three mechanisms of action. It reduces the viral entry through endosomes. It helps work as a zinc ionophore. And zinc actually works to impair the RNA-dependent polymerase. And lastly, it's an anti-inflammatory. It changes the overall profile of cells so there's less inflammation. 259 supportive trials, 385,000 individuals and Hydroxychloroquine is like I say, our mainstay in COVID-19 treatment. We have large studies as outpatients demonstrating hazard ratios 11here, much less than one, implying a 50% reduction in hospitalization and death from outpatient studies. We have a very large study from Iran where there's been, as you can see here, 28,000 individuals, they treat about 25% of their high-risk patients with a short course of Hydroxychloroquine plus other drugs, 30% reduction in hospitalization and death (Appendix 15) 22Ivermectin Another drug that impairs viral entry to the nucleus also has some properties against the spike protein. We have 60 trials with Ivermectin, a much smaller amount of information than Hydroxychloroquine, but that's still substantial. And here, Ivermectin has favourable hazard ratios for both inpatient and outpatient use, about a 70% reduction in mortality. (Appendix 16) 23Favipiravir Available in five countries overall, it's like oral Remdesivir . Remdesivir is currently approved in Japan as a treatment for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Outside of Japan, Remdesivir is an investigational, unapproved drug. A report in the New England Journal of Medicine in May concludes that the broad spectrum antiviral medication developed by the biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults hospitalized with COVID-19 and who had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection (Appendix 17). 24Corticosteroids This is a mainstay of inpatient treatment. A meta-analysis suggests a 30% reduction in mortality. Inhaled Budesonide, known in the United States as Pulmicort, a randomized trial called the Stoic Trial. There was an 87% reduction in hospitalizations with inhaled Budesonide. So we have positive data for both oral and inhaled steroids (Appendix 18). 25Colchicine (off label) Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory drug. The largest, highest quality, randomized prospective double-blind placebo-controlled trial. This was coordinated at Montreal Heart Institute. Over 4,000 outpatients with symptomatic COVID-19, and among those who were confirmed positive, a 25% reduction in hospitalization and death (Appendix 19) 1226Clade x and Event 201 Scenario In May, 2018, the WEF partnered with Johns Hopkins to simulate a fictitious pandemic dubbed 'Clade X' (Appendix 12) to see how prepared the world be if ever faced with a catastrophic pandemic. A little over a year later, the WEF once again teamed-up with Johns Hopkins, along with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , to stage another pandemic exercise called 'Event 201' in October, 2019 (Appendix 13). Both simulations concluded that the world wasn't prepared for a global pandemic. A few short months following the conclusion of Event 201, which specifically simulated a coronavirus outbreak , the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared that the coronavirus had reached pandemic status on March 11, 2020. 27\"The next severe pandemic will not only cause great illness and loss of life but could also trigger major cascading economic and societal consequences that could contribute greatly to global impact and suffering \" \u2014 Event 201 pandemic simulation (October, 2019) 27aSince then, just about every scenario covered in the Clade X and Event 201 simulations has come into play, including: Governments implementing lockdowns worldwide The collapse of many industries Growing mistrust between governments and citizens A greater adoption of biometric surveillance technologies Social media censorship in the name of combating misinformation The desire to flood communication channels with \"authoritative\" sources A global lack of personal protective equipment The breakdown of international supply chains Mass unemployment Rioting in the streets 28After the nightmare scenarios had fully materialized by mid-2020, the WEF founder declared \"now is the time for a great reset \" in June 2021. 1329We submit that it is highly unlikely, to the point that it is unbelievable , that this is purely excellent forecasting, planning, and modelling on the part of the WEF and partners that Clade X and Event 201 turned out to be so prophetic. 30Agenda 21/30 and the Great Reset Agenda \"The pandemic represents a rare but narrow window of opportunity to reflect, reimagine, and reset our world to create a healthier, more equitable, and more prosperous future \" \u2014 Klaus Schwab, World Economic Forum 31The so-called \"great reset\" promises to build 'a more secure, more equal, and more stable world\" if everyone on the planet agrees to \" act jointly and swiftly to revamp all aspects of our societies and economies, from education to social contracts and working conditions. \" (Appendix 11) But it wouldn't have been possible to contemplate materializing such an all- encompassing plan for a new world order without a global crisis, be it manufactured or of unfortunate happenstance, that shocked society to its core. 32Together, the Johns Hopkins Centre for Health Security, the World Economic Forum, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation submitted seven recommendations for governments, international organizations, and global business to follow in the event of a pandemic (Appendix 14). The Event 201 recommendations call for greater collaboration between the public and private sectors while emphasizing the importance of establishing partnerships with un-elected, global institutions such as the WHO, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the International Air Transport Organization, to carry out a centralized response. One of the recommendations calls for governments to partner with social media companies and news organization to censor content and control the flow of information. 33According to the report, \"Governments will need to partner with traditional and social media companies to research and develop nimble approaches to countering misinformation. National public health agencies should work in close collaboration with WHO to create the capability to rapidly develop and release consistent health messages. For their part, media companies should commit to ensuring that authoritative messages are prioritized and that false messages are suppressed including though [sic] the use of technology.\" 1434Censorship Throughout 2020, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube have been censoring, suppressing, and flagging any coronavirus-related information that goes against World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations as a matter of policy, just as Event 201 had recommended. Big tech companies have also deployed the same content suppression tactics during the 2020 US presidential elections \u2014 attaching \"disputed\" claims on content that question election integrity. The UK government and governments around the world are using the 'pandemic' to crack down on free expression and access to information. From the onset of Covid-19, political considerations have clashed with concerns about public health and free expression. Authorities have blocked legitimate websites and ordered the removal of unwanted content. Officials have reinforced these controls by criminalising more categories of online expression and arresting journalists, activists, and members for public speaking about the government's performance. To suppress unfavourable health statistics, critical reporting and other COVID- 19 content the UK government has blocked websites or forced users, social media platforms, or online outlets to delete information. There has been an unprecedented assault on the freedom of doctors to care for their patients, and Dr Robert Malone, the INVENTOR of the RNA vaccines has been de-platformed on all social media for speaking out against the covid injections. Some academic journals are blocking the publication of studies showing the effectiveness of drugs such as Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine. Smear campaigns are being waged against any doctors and scientists who challenge the WHO narrative on Covid- 19 and the Covid-19 'vaccines'. We are in a situation where governments and global NGO's have seized control of the medical profession. Parallels to 1930's Germany 34aThere are several survivors of the German Holocaust drawing stark parallels between Covid restrictions and the beginning of the Holocaust. An open letter sent to; the European Medical Agency (EMA), The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), U.K, The Australian Health Regulation Agency, (AHPRA), Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), Australia, Medsafe, New Zealand and the Federation of Medical Regulatory Authorities (FMRAC), Canada (Appendix 50) states, \"We, the survivors of the atrocities committed against humanity during the Second World War, feel bound to follow our conscience. ... Another holocaust of greater magnitude is taking place before our eyes. We call upon you to stop this ungodly medical experiment on 15humankind immediately. It is a medical experiment to which the Nuremberg Code must be applied.\" ( Rabbi Reiner Fuellmich, (Appendix 51) Holocaust survivor Vera Sharav draws on her experience during Nazi Germany to form her perspective on what is happening in the world today. During the interview she goes on to say: 34c \"Under the Nazi Regime, moral norms were systematically obliterated. The medical profession and institutions were radically transformed, academic science, the military, industry and clinical medicine were tightly interwoven, as they are NOW. The Nazi system destroyed a social conscience in the name of Public Health. Violations against individuals and classes of human beings were institutionalised. Eugenics driven public health policies replaced the Physician's focus on the good of the individual. [The] German medical profession and institutions were perverted. Coercive public health policies violated individual civil and human rights. Criminal methods were used to enforce policy. Nazi Propaganda used fear of infectious epidemics to demonise Jews as spreaders of disease , as a menace to public health.... Fear and propaganda were the psychological weapons the Nazis used to impose a genocidal regime and today, some are beginning to understand why the German people didn't rise up, fear kept them from doing the right thing. Medical mandates are a major step backwards towards a fascist dictatorship and genocide. Government dictates, medical intervention, these undermine our dignity as well as our FREEDOM... .The stark lesson of the Holocaust is that whenever doctors join forces with government and deviate from their personal, professional, clinical commitment to do no harm to the individual, medicine can then be perverted from a healing, humanitarian profession to a murderous apparatus... What sets the Holocaust apart from all other mass genocides is the pivotal role played by the medical establishment, the entire medical establishment. Every step of the murderous process was endorsed by the academic, professional medical establishment. Medical doctors and prestigious medical societies and institutions lent the veneer of legitimacy to infanticide, mass murder of civilians. T4 was the first industrialised medical murder project in history. The first victims were disabled German infants and children under 3.... The next victims were the mentally ill, followed by the elderly in nursing homes. The murderous operations were methodical, and followed protocol very, very carefully. \" 16B. THE NUREMBERG CODE - 35a medical code of ethics based on the laws under which the Nazi criminals were judged in U.S.A. vs. Karl Brandt, et al . (Nuremberg physicians' trial), for their role in conducting horrific medical experiments during the Second World War. The Nuremberg Code later constituted the basis for the Helsinki Declaration 1965 which binds the World Medical Association and practicing physicians to ' act in the [individual] patient's best interest when providing medical care '. 36Article 21 of the Rome Statute sets out the legal sources upon which the ICC may draw. The statute defines three primary sources of international law; international treaties, international custom, and general principles of law recognised by civilized nations. It is recognised that the three sources are of equal value and that there is no hierarchy among them. According to the Statute, subsidiary means for determining the rules of law are judicial decisions and academic writings. Besides these enumerated sources, international legal rules can also be created by unilateral acts, such as declaration or a reservation (Shabas William, An Introduction to the International Criminal Court, 155, (2017)) 36aWe submit to the Court that the Nuremberg Code qualifies as a source of international law by way of Article 21(1)(b) of the Rome Statute. Article 21(3) states that the application and interpretation of law 'must be consistent with internationally recognised human rights'. We submit that that 'Physician's trial case' established a precedent that must be drawn upon for the purpose of this request and we submit for consideration the notion that the Nuremberg code qualifies as a source of international law under the jus cogens principle. 37The elements of customary (jus cogens) international law include: the widespread repetition by States of similar international acts over time (State practice); the requirement that the acts must occur out of a sense of obligation (opinio juris); and that the acts are taken by a significant number of States and not rejected by a significant number of States. 38In 1950, the International Law Commission listed as evidence of customary international law: treaties, decisions of national courts and international tribunals , national legislation, 17diplomatic correspondence, opinions of national legal advisors, and the practice of international organizations (\"Report of the International Law Commission to the General Assembly (Part II): Ways and Means of Making the Evidence of Customary International Law More Readily Available,\" [1950] 2 Y.B. Int'l L. Comm'n 367, ILC Doc. A/1316). 39i. Practice requirement - We submit that this requirement is satisfied by way of the pharmaceutical manufacturers operating internationally and the Nuremberg code for medical practice being extended into general codes of medical ethics by both States, Global NGO's and to which all physicians and pharmaceutical companies are bound. The Nuremberg Code has not been officially adopted in its entirety as law by any nation, nonetheless, its basic requirement of informed consent, has been universally accepted and is articulated in international law in Article 7 of the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966). Informed consent, with specific reliance on the Nuremberg Code, is also the basis of the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects, the most recent guidelines promulgated by the World Health Organization and the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (1993). 40ii. Opinio Juris sive necessitatis requirement - We submit that the worldwide recognition, acceptance, adoption, and practice of the ethical standards of the Nuremberg Code through general codes of medical ethics amounts to an obligation on physicians and pharmaceutical manufacturers to abide by the principles. Any physician or research scientist found to have breached any of the 10 principles of the Nuremberg code would face criminal liability, therefore we submit that the opinion juris requirement is satisfied qualifying the Nuremberg Code as a source of international law under the Jus cogens customary norm principle. 41It is our intention to present to you, and detail how, in the United Kingdom this year, the Government of the United Kingdom, with its Ministers and senior officials have violated the Nuremberg Code not only in a single aspect but in many aspects. 42 a) Informed consent to participate in a medical experiment The first principle of the Nuremberg Code is a willingness and informed consent by the person to receive treatment and participate in an experiment. The person is supposed to 18activate freedom of choice without the intervention, either through force, deceit, fraud, threat, solicitation, or any other type of binding or coercion. 43When the heads of the Ministry of Health as well as the Prime Minister presented the vaccine in the United Kingdom and began the vaccination of United Kingdom residents, the vaccinated were not advised, that in practice, they would be taking part in a medical experiment and that their consent is required under the Nuremberg Code. This as a matter of fact is a genetic medical experiment on human beings performed without informed consent under a severe and blatant offense of the Nuremberg Code. 44b) Alternative treatments - On the subject of informed consent for medical treatment, and based on the Nuremberg Code principles, an obligation exists to detail and suggest to a patient several treatment alternatives, detailing the medical process (and all that is included in it) as well as the advantages and disadvantages/ benefits and risks, existing in every treatment, to enable him to make an intelligent personal decision regarding the treatment he prefers. As stated, this choice must be made freely by the individual. 45Despite all of the above-stated, the Government of the United Kingdom and the Ministry of Health continue to fail to present the citizens of the United Kingdom with the currently existing alternatives for treating Covid 19. Alternative treatments that have now been proven to be both extremely safe and extremely efficacious in the treatment of Covid 19 with up to a 100% success rate with alternative treatments mentioned above. The government of the United Kingdom continue to solicit their citizens, pressuring and manipulating them in blatant violation of the informed consent process, intentionally concealing information regarding the vaccinations and creating an atmosphere of fear and coercion. c) The experiment will be conducted to prevent suffering or physical injury. 46It is known that the m-RNA 'vaccination' treatments have caused the death of many as well as injury and severe damage (including disablement and paralysis) after the 'vaccine' was administered. Despite this fact, the government did not instruct the initiation of an investigation into the matter. It is also questionable that given the experimental nature of these vaccinations, that there are not any full reports available of the numbers of dead or 19injured, as may be expected in such a medical process for the benefit of the public participating in the experiment. d) The experiment must not be conducted when there is reason to assume that death or real injury will occur. 47- Regarding the violation of this principle, as stated above, the data on cases of death from the treatment is suppressed and we the citizens hear only by word of mouth and on social networks (friends, neighbours or relatives) not from the state media. e) The individual in charge of the experiment must be prepared to terminate the experiment at any stage, if he has probable cause to believe it will cause injury, disability or death of the experiment participant. 48- It has already been proven that many have died from the m-RNA treatments, were injured or became disabled; however the Government of the United Kingdom continues to compel this dangerous experiment on its citizens. C. THE ROME STATUTE 49 It is our further intention to present to you, and detail how, in the United Kingdom this year, the Government of the United Kingdom, with its Ministers and senior officials have violated the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court not only in a single aspect but in many aspects. ARTICLE 6 - Genocide 50 Pursuant to the Rome Statute's Article 6, - \" genocide\" means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group, as such: (a) Killing members of these groups: 51- the group in this case is in principle \"the entire population of the United Kingdom\" (and the world) starting with the elderly, chronically ill and disabled. 20(b) Causing serious bodily harm or mental harm to members of the group: 52- Proven long-term effects 8 months after first being infected by the virus (appendix 20 53- Massive short-term damage and death from the 'vaccines'. As of 24th November 2021, for the UK 136,582 yellow cards have been reported for the Pfizer 'vaccine', 238,086 have been reported for the AstraZeneca, 19,101 for the Moderna and 1,280 have been reported where the brand was not specified. That is a total of 395,049 reported adverse reactions in the UK alone that were serious enough to warrant being reported to the Yellow Card reporting system (Appendix 20) 54- Expected long term effects as above in the vaccinated 55- Statistical evidence suggests massive increase in deaths after 'vaccination' (Appendix 21) 56- Immeasurable mental harm caused by 24/7 psychological warfare propaganda, false positive PCR tests, lack of medical care and mass vaccinations. 57- Increase in alcoholics relapsing, eating disorders relapsing and not being managed in the community due to lockdowns. 58- The number of vulnerable children calling ChildLine was up 37% over lockdowns (Appendix 22) (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life, calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part: 59- Destruction of wealth and businesses by the imposed lockdowns (Appendix 23) 60- Inflicting damage on the immune systems of all those who either got ill from the virus and/or received the m-RNA 'vaccine', the mask mandates and mandatory test regimes 61Statistics prove that those who received a covid-'vaccine' are at greater risk of getting seriously ill, and even family members of the vaccinated are become ill and in some cases dying. This is an extremely alarming signal of what the future holds. (Appendix 24) 21(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group: 62- Proven increase in spontaneous abortion after a Covid m-RNA 'vaccination. A recent study in the New England Medical Journal showed 8 in 10 women had a miscarriage after taking a Covid 'vaccine' before the third trimester (Appendix 25) 63- Expected reduction in fertility after a Covid-'vaccination' due to the deliberate change in DNA sequencing from the m-RNA (Appendix 26) ARTICLE 7 - Crimes against humanity 64Pursuant to the Rome Statute's Article 7 - Crimes against humanity, means any of the following acts when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack: (a) Murder: 65- Statistics from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shown below (also Appendix 27) have recorded between January 2nd 2021 and July 2nd 202l, 18,653 deaths within 21 days of the first dose of a Covid Vaccine - 4,388 (30%) of those involving the Covid-19 virus. 73,822 deaths 21 days or more after the first dose - 7,289 (11%) of those involved the Covid- 19 Virus. 11,652 deaths within 21 days of a second dose - 182 (1.5%) involved the Covid-19 virus and 57,721 deaths 21 days or more after second dose - 458 (0.8%). 2266 Further data from the ONS shown in the tables below (also Appendix 28) demonstrates, that there was a 23% increase in the deaths registered in January 2021 compared with January 2020. Similarly with February 2021 compared with February 2020 there was increase in overall deaths of 26%. We know that the Covid 19 'vaccines' were rolled out in the UK in December of 2020 and anyone who was genuinely willing to take the 'vaccines' freely and without political pressure or coercion was going to do so within the first few weeks of the rollout, this staggering increase in death within the first 8 weeks of the introduction of the experimental vaccines is alarming to say the least and warrants a full investigation by the court. 2367The protocol in the UK for an individual who tests positive for Covid-19 has been to self- isolate and stay home until you absolutely can't breathe at which point you go to the hospital to be put on a ventilator and in most cases die. A study (Appendix 29) of 1023 covid-19 patients on ventilators found that 42% of them died and 57% survived. We submit that the suppression of safe and effective alternative treatments for Covid-19 amounts to murder and warrants a full investigation by the court. 68Data taken from the ONS below shows that during April 2020 there were 26,541 deaths that occurred in care homes, an increase of 17,850 on the five-year average. (Appendix 52 ) 69The Liverpool Care Pathway was abandoned in 2014 after being deemed inhumane, but evidence suggests it was brought back at the start of the pandemic in early 2020 and is being implemented in care homes across the UK. In a House of commons document, Matt Hancock and Conservative MP Dr Luke Evans discuss the use of medications to give Covid patients a 'good death' (euthanasia). (Appendix 30) 70 In March 202 Hancock ordered two years' worth of a sedative called Midazolam from a French supplier (Appendix 31). At the time the order was made it was claimed that Midazolam was for the treatment of covid 19 patients - Midazolam suppresses the respiratory system - Covid-19 is a respiratory disease. We request the court carry out a full investigation into why the UK government would purchase two years' worth of Midazolam, a drug associated with respiratory suppression and respiratory arrest, to treat a disease that causes respiratory suppression and respiratory arrest. 24(Appendix 32) 71The document (Appendix 32) also provides a table confirming dosage of Midazolam for the elderly or unwell should be no more than 0.5mg-1mg, side effects include cardiorespiratory depression and the drug should be used with caution in those suffering respiratory disease. 72A document produced by the NHS (Appendix 33) states that Midalozam should be used for comfort at the end of life care due to Covid-19 to ease fear, anxiety and agitation. The document states that Midazolam should be used for sedation prior to the patient requiring mechanical ventilation. The same document also provides confirmation that Midazolam has the potential to impair the respiration system, particularly in the presence of disease or old age and clearly states that dosage should be kept to a minimum and should be within the manufacturers guidelines. 2573We submit that creating policy for treating patient allegedly suffering anxiety due to Covid- 19 with a starting dose of 2.5mg of Midazolam when the recommended dose for elderly and/or frail patients is 0.25mg amounts to unlawful euthanasia and murder and warrants a full investigation by the court. 74Additionally, a large number of vaccinated people are getting seriously ill and are at risk of dying from an immune system failure, antibody dependent enhancement, in the near future (Appendix 34) (b) Extermination: 75There is good reason to assume that a large percentage of the UK population (and world population) is now at risk of either serious illness or death due to the recent mRNA 'vaccines'. Animal studies conducted in 2012-2013 (Appendix 35 and 36) to test mRNA vaccines found most animals died within 2 weeks of receiving the treatment, this is equivalent to 1.5 years for humans. The vaccinated have been exposed to the very same 'man-made spike protein' as the virus. Both the virus and the vaccines have been proven to be able to change human DNA (Appendix 37). The immune system is unlikely to ever return to what it was after receiving a covid 'vaccination'. Several high-level immunologists and vaccine designers including joint applicant on this request Dr Mike Yeadon, have warned, in the worst possible scenario, most of the human race who have received these m-RNA treatments will perish. 26(e) Imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law: 76- Ban on freedom of travel both national and international 77- Forced lockdown and economic warfare - especially on small business owners - forcing people to be dependent on the State for survival 78- Forced quarantine in hotels for both healthy and false positive PCR tests and rapid flow tests returning from international travel. 79- Forced 'self -isolation' at the demand of NHS Track and Trace app 80- Severe deprivation of physical liberties on travel, visiting friends, arranging parties, taking part in cultural and sports activities, religious congregations (f) Torture: 81- Psychological terror and warfare (mental torture) is being administered by the Government, State Media and main-stream media along with Social Media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google. (g) Rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancies, enforced sterilisations, or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity: 82- One effect of the 'vaccines' suggested by a number of medical doctors and scientists is 'enforced sterilisations' with a number of spontaneous abortions/ miscarriages reported by pregnant women who received a covid 'vaccine' (Appendix 38, 39) (h) Persecution against any identifiable group or collectively on political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender as defined in paragraph 3, or other grounds that are universally recognised as impermissible under international law, in connection with any act referred to in this paragraph or any crime within the jurisdiction of the Court: 83- Persecution against the unvaccinated, loss of jobs, refusal to public events 84- Persecution against all religious groups being hindered to attend places of worship 27(j) Apartheid: 85- The real effect of the new 'vaccine passport' will introduce a new form of medical apartheid, for the benefit of pressuring people to get vaccinated and to deprive those who are not vaccinated of the right to travel, work and participate in society as normal. (k) Other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering or serious injury to the body or to mental or physical health: 86- Social distancing measures, mask mandates, fear mongering, vaccination pressure as well as the 'vaccines' themselves are all reasons for serious injury to the body, mind and soul. ARTICLE 8 - War crimes 87Contextual element of a war crime - We submit to you that a covert war has been waged against the people of the United Kingdom (and the world) through the release of the biological weapon SARS-Cov-2 and the additional bioweapon, m-RNA gene therapy 'vaccines'. We submit that the people of the United Kingdom (and the world) are under systemic attack from those who released the beforementioned biological weapons and by those individuals within the UK Government and international leaders against which we have brought this request, who seek to serve the same agenda. We therefore submit that the contextual element of a war crime has been met and the alleged crimes took place in the context of an international and non-international armed conflict. 88Mens Rea element: We further submit that the members of the UK government and world international leaders against which we have brought this complaint, are knowingly working on behalf of this global agenda for depopulation through the biological weapons known as SARS-Cov-2 and the m-RNA 'vaccines'. We submit therefore that the members of the UK government and world leaders against which we have brought this complaint have both knowledge and intent with respect to these alleged crimes. 89The Court shall have jurisdiction in respect of war crimes in particular when committed as part of a plan or policy or as part of a large-scale commission of such crimes. 2890Pursuant to the Rome Statute Article 8 'war crimes' means: (a) Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of August 12, 1949, namely, any of the following acts against persons or property protected under the provisions of the relevant Geneva Convention: (i) Wilful killing: 91- We have provided statistical data of the death rate of the 'vaccines' killing a relatively large proportion of recipients, with numbers increasing as a result of more 'vaccinations' being administered, it is a logical conclusion that the continuing use of these 'vaccines' constitutes a wilful killing. Even if the victims are predominantly elderly, we also have a relatively high proportion of deaths and harm for younger and healthier people. 92- We have provided evidence that the use of 5 times the recommended amount of Midazolam for patients in care homes amounts to wilful killing 93- Graphene hydroxide in the vaccines (ii) Torture 94- The Cov-SARS-2 Virus is a man-made \"gain of function virus\". It was created as a \"biological experiment\" at the Wuhan Institute of Virology during a period of at least 10-15 years, according to massive documentation enclosed hereby. The Virus was released, either by an accident or deliberately. 95- The development of such a biological weapon is a crime on its own merit. 96- The use of the masks by a mandate also constitutes a biological experiment. Which has caused massive harms as documented in the Danish Mask study (Appendix 40) 97 - The use of the test-pins and the use of cancer rated chemicals in the noses of millions of humans are also clearly a biological experiment or warfare. 2998- The so-called vaccines are only approved for emergency use only, and the massive use of these gene therapy drugs constitute the largest biological experiment in human history and causing an irreversible change to the DNA, through the Vaccination. 99- Such an experiment on our DNA is the worst crime ever committed against the human race, totally without informed consent. (iii) Wilfully causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or health: 100- The forced use of face masks has caused great harm, both physically and mentally. 101- The closing down of doctor's offices has clearly caused serious injury to body and health with a number of serious illnesses going undiagnosed and/or untreated for months due to closures 102- The vaccines are proven to kill and cause major damage to health, based on the short-term effects only. 103- The psychological warfare, and economic warfare by the lock downs, combined with the medical and biological warfare causes immense injury to the health. 104- The denial of use of effective medicine (HCQ, Ivermectin), against Cov-Sars2 is a cause of serious injury to body or health and the cause of many preventable deaths in the UK 105- Suppression of alternative treatments 106- Use of ventilators with such low success rate 107- Midazolam used to euthanise elderly in care homes (iv) Extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and want only: 108- The extensive economical destruction of business activity, as well as private wealth and personal and business income due to UK lockdowns has led to a massive appropriation of 30private property by the banks, from people, who are not able to achieve a normal income due to all the effects of the lockdowns 109- A massive transfer of property from the middle class to the ultrarich Globalists will be the consequence of these policies worldwide. This can be interpreted as the biggest land and power grab in modern history. (v) Intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population as such or against individual civilians not taking direct part in hostilities: 110- The people of the United Kingdom (and the entire human race) are currently under attack by way of these draconian measures and biological warfare, which is an integrated part of a psychological and economic warfare. (iv) Intentionally launching an attack in the knowledge that such attack will cause incidental loss of life or injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects or widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment which would be clearly excessive in relation to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated: 111- The creation of the Cov-SARS-2 virus was the pre-condition for launching this attack. 112- There is a timeline going back to the 1990s and the first SARS1 virus, as to the MERS Virus. And to both US Military biological research (DARPA), linked to French, British, Australian and to a large extent the Chinese efforts done during more than 15 years. 113- There is a clear link to the so-called Globalist Elite, the Club of Rome, the WEF (Davos Group), Globalist politicians, the biggest Capitalists on earth, and their plan of Agenda 2030 (UN), WHO, and \"the Great Reset\". 114- These people have clearly spoken of a need for a great global depopulation, and Bill Gates among others, have stated that the Vaccinations is one way to do it. 115- Gain of Function manipulation of the Virus has given the virus properties that makes it able to spread 10-20 times compared to the SARS 1 and MERS and all other Corona viruses. The scientists behind this gain of function research have created a dangerous synthetic Virus, as 31documented enclosed. With a dangerous \"Hiv GP120\" component to make it dormant, like HIV. (Appendix 49) 116- The project seems to be a Global conspiracy to radically change both the demographical as well as the political landscape, by a transformation from a democratic system into a totalitarian world, to be ruled by a centralised unelected elite. 117- The massive destruction of life, the effects of economic warfare, connected to an alleged medical emergency, and a massive psychological warfare operation, with the initial aim of brainwashing the population into accepting mass vaccination, as the only remedy for returning to a less than normal situation, and the only available the first step. 118- The massive economic melt-down is leading to a financial collapse of epic proportions, causing states and currencies, at least in Europe, to collapse totally. 119- Based on the economic ruin and catastrophe, it is likely that martial law will be introduced, a result of the economic collapse and the coming social unrest. Under the Defence Act 2020 new powers were given to the police to 'strengthen enforcement powers to reduce the spread of Corona virus, protect the NHS and save lives' I20- The financial crisis will most likely lead to the collapse of both banks and central banks, and loss of private property on a massive scale, to the benefit of the ultrarich elite only. 121- New bail out rules, and delays on financial reporting, has only delayed this crash. 122- On top of all of this, and other measures, the medium and long-term effects of both the Cov- SARS2, as well as the \"Vaccines\" will soon be apparent, causing massive illness and death of biblical proportions, never seen before. ARTICLE 8 bis 3 - Crimes of aggression 123For the purpose of this Statute, \"crime of aggression\" means the planning, preparation, initiation or execution, by a person in a position effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military action of a State, of an act of aggression which, by its character, gravity and scale, constitutes a manifest violation of the Charter of the United Nations. 32124This is a global criminal conspiracy, which has been planned for several decades. 125It is now obvious that \"the plan\" involves the ultrarich and leaders of most nation states, with a few exceptions. It is also clear that powerful think-tanks including WEF in Davos as well as the Club of Rome, and other NGOs like WHO and GAVI among others, are at the centre of this draconian criminal conspiracy. Under the official slogan; \"BUILD BACK BETTER\", used by the President of WHO, the President of USA, as well as the President of WEF, the Prime Minister of the UK as well as countless other World leaders. 126The goal of this activity is to create a new world order, through the UN\u00a8s Agenda 2030, by dismantling all the Democratic Nation States, step by step, controlled by an un-elected elite and to destroy the freedoms and basic human rights of the peoples of the Earth. In addition to this, the aim is to destroy small and medium sized businesses, moving the market shares to the largest corporations, owned by the Global Elite. The fulfilment of this goal will most likely lead to full enslavement of mankind. 127This is being done by means of the threat from both a dangerous biological weapon, the virus, the vaccines, the testing test pins, the mask mandates and all other measures. All of which constitute not only a breach of National laws, but also a fundamental breach of the Charter of the United Nations and the Treaty of Rome and our Fundamental Human rights. 128It is of the utmost urgency that ICC take immediate action, taking all of this into account, to stop the rollout of covid vaccinations, introduction of unlawful vaccination passports and all other types of illegal warfare mentioned herein currently being waged against the people of the United Kingdom by way of a court injunction. D. REQUEST FOR THE OPENING OF AN ENQUIRY 129 Jurisdiction Alleged crimes within the jurisdiction of the court On the basis of the information available, there is a reasonable basis to believe that violations of the Nuremberg Code, genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes have been committed. 33Place and date of alleged commission of the crimes: Territory: 130- The above crimes are alleged to have been committed in the territory of the United Kingdom (and the world) 131- Since the United Kingdom is a State Party, the Court may exercise jurisdiction over all alleged crimes committed on United Kingdom Territory since October 4, 2000, irrespective of the nationality of the accused. 132- In particular, article 12(2)(a) provides that the Court may exercise its jurisdiction over crimes referred to in article 5 if the \"State on the territory of which the conduct in question occurred\" is a Party to the Statute. Thus, since the alleged crimes identified in this Request have been committed on the territory of a State Party to the Rome Statute, the Court has territorial jurisdiction over these alleged crimes, regardless of whether the alleged suspects are nationals of a State Party (D. Akande, 'The Jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court over Nationals of Non-Parties: Legal Basis and Limits', Jrnl and Third States', in A. Cassese, P. Gaeta & J. Jones eds., The Rome Statute Of The International Criminal Court: A Commentary, (2002), pp. 1871-1897). 133 - A suspect is not required to be physically present in the territory of a State Party when a crime is committed for the Court to be able to exercise jurisdiction over his or her conduct, as long as the crime imputed to the suspect occurred within the confines of such territory (Prosecutor v. Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi and Abdullah Al-Senussi, Appeals Chamber, \"Judgment on the appeal of Libya against the decision of Pre-Trial Chamber I of 31 May 2013 entitled 'Decision on the admissibility of the case against Saif Al- Islam Gaddafi'\", ICC-01/11-01/11-547-Red, 21 May 2014, para. 62) 134 Date - The crimes allegedly committed on the territory of the United Kingdom between ........ and ...... fall within the Court's jurisdiction Admissibility Complementarity a. Legal references Article 17(1)(a) and (b) establishes a twofold test for complementarity: 136(i) whether, at the time of the proceedings in respect of an admissibility challenge, there is an on-going investigation or prosecution of the same case at the national level (first limb); and, if this is answered in the affirmative, 137(ii) whether the State is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out such investigations or prosecutions (second limb) (Prosecutor v. Germain Katanga and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui, Appeals Chamber, \"Judgment on the Appeal of Mr. Germain Katanga against the Oral Decision of Trial Chamber II of 12 June 2009 on the Admissibility of the Case\", ICC-01/04- 01/07-1497, 25 1 and 75-79). 138Inaction by a State under the first limb renders a case admissible before the Court, subject to an assessment of gravity under article 17(1)(d) ( Katanga Admissibility Appeals Judgment, para. 78). The Prosecution conducts its determination(s) on complementarity in relation to the potential cases that are likely to be the focus of an investigation by the Prosecution. 139The admissibility provisions of the Statute are founded on the complementary relationship between the ICC and \"national criminal jurisdictions\". As such, in principle, it is only national criminal investigations and/or prosecutions of a State that can trigger the application of article 17(1)(a)-(c). 140Gravity The gravity assessment has been conducted against the backdrop of the potential cases that are likely to arise from an investigation into the Situation (Kenya Article 15 Decision, paras. 50, 58, and 188; Co te d'Ivoire Article 15 Decision, para. 202). 35141 A gravity assessment involves a generic examination of whether the persons or groups of persons relevant to the assessment capture those who may bear the greatest responsibility for the alleged crimes committed. The assessment must also be done from both a quantitative and a qualitative viewpoint, and factors such as nature, scale and manner of commission of the alleged crimes, as well as their impact on victims, are all indicators of the gravity of a given case (Kenya Article 15 Decision, paras. 60-62; Co te d'Ivoire Article 15 Decision, paras 203-205; Georgia Article 15 Decision, para. 51). 142 Accordingly, the Prosecution's submissions on gravity relate to an assessment of gravity of the entire situation rather than the gravity one or more potential cases. 143 Based on the information available, the potential case concerning alleged crimes committed by members of the United Kingdom Government and world leaders mentioned herein are of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. 144The alleged crimes have been committed on a large scale, with reports that murder has been practised institutionally 145 Interests of Justice The seriousness and extent of the crimes committed in the United Kingdom, highlighted by the scope of people that these crimes affect, that these crimes continue to be committed, the wide range of perpetrators, the recurring patterns of criminality and the limited prospects for accountability at the national level, all weigh heavily in favour of an investigation. 146Victims of alleged crimes within the context of the situation have manifested their interest in seeing justice done. We have sought to ascertain the interests of victims, through direct consultations with victims' organisations in the United Kingdom as well as through examination of communications and publicly available information. 147In light of the gravity if the acts committed, and the absence of relevant national proceedings against those who appear to be most responsible for the most serious crimes within the situation, the potential case that would arise from an investigation of the situation would be admissible. Taking into account the gravity of the crimes and the interests of the victims, 36there are no substantial reasons to believe that an investigation would not serve the interests of justice. 148Experience shows that impunity is a factor that aggravates the commission of crimes 149The decision to seize the Pre-Trial Chamber for the initiation of the investigation would be hailed by the peoples of the United Kingdom and the world. 150This decision would have a particularly useful role as it would be a response to crimes currently being committed. It would inevitably bring about a change in practices, at least in the extent to mandated vaccinations and vaccine passports and this decision would save lives limiting the number of new wounded by these m-RNA treatments. 151 The request for investigation meets the criteria of the Statute, and will constitute progress in the fight against impunity and ultimately secure the survival of the human race as we know it. 152And Justice will be done 153WE WANT TO REPEAT: It is of the utmost urgency that ICC take immediate action, taking all of this into account, to stop the rollout of covid vaccinations, introduction of unlawful vaccination passports and all other types of illegal warfare mentioned herein currently being waged against the people of the United Kingdom by way of an IMMEDIATE court -19 vaccine surveillance report Week 42 COVID -19 vaccine surveillance report - week 42 2 Contents Summary ................................ ................................

Rigorous clinical trials have been undertaken to understand the immune response, safety profile and efficacy of these v accines as part of the regulatory process. Ongoing monitoring of the vaccines as they are rolled out in the population is important to continually ensure that clinical and public health guidance on the vaccination programme is built upon the best available evidence. UK Health Security Agency, UK HSA, formerly Public Health England (PHE) , works closely with the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA), NHS England, and other government, devolved administration and academic partners to monitor the COV ID-19 vaccination programme. Details of the vaccine surveillance strategy are set on the page COVID -19: vaccine surveillance strategy (1). As with all vaccines, the safety of COVID -19 vaccines is continuously being monitored by the MHRA . They conclude that overall, the benefits of COVID -19 vaccines outweigh any potential risks ( 2). Vaccine effectiveness Several studies of vaccine effectiveness have been conducted in the UK which indicate that 2 doses of vacc ine are between 65 and 95% effective at preventing symptomatic disease with COVID -19 with the Delta variant, with higher levels of protection against severe disease including hospitalisation and death. There is some evidence of waning of protection against infection and symptomatic disease over time, though protection against severe dis ease remains high in most groups at least 5 months after the second dose. Population impact The impact of the vaccination programme on the population is assessed by taking i nto account vaccine coverage, evidence on vaccine effectiveness and the latest COV ID-19 disease surveillance indicators. Vaccine coverage tells us about the proportion of the population that have received 1 and 2 d oses of COVID -19 vaccines. By 10 Octo ber 2 021, the overall vaccine uptak e in England for dose 1 was 65. 5% and 60. 4% for dose 2. In line with the programme rollout, coverage is highest in the oldest age groups. We present data on COVID -19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths by vaccination status. Based on antibo dy testing of blood donors, 98. 0% of the adult population now have an tibodies to COVID -19 from either infection or vaccination compared to 1 8.7% that have antibodi es from infection alone. COVID -19 vaccine surveillance report - week 42 4 Vaccine effectiveness Large clinical trials have been undertaken for each of the COVID -19 vaccines approved in the UK which found that they are highly efficacious at preventing symptomatic disease in the populations that were studied. The clinical trials have been designed to be able to assess the efficacy o f the vaccine against laboratory confirmed symptomatic disease with a relatively s hort follow up period so that effective vaccines can be introduced as rapidly as possible. Nevertheless, understanding the effectiveness against different outcomes (such as s evere disease and onwards transmission), effectiveness in different subgroups of t he population and understanding the duration of protection are equally important in decision making around which vaccines should be implemented as the programme evolves, who they should be offered to and whether booster doses are required. Vaccine effectiv eness is estimated by comparing rates of disease in vaccinated individuals to rates in unvaccinated individuals. Below we outline the latest real -world evidence on vaccine effectiveness from studies in UK populations. We focus on data related to the Delta variant which is currently dominant in the UK. The findings are also summarised in Table 1 . Effectiveness against symptomatic disease Vaccine effecti veness against symptomatic COVID -19 has been assessed in England based on community testing data linked to vaccination data from the National Immunisation Management System (NIMS), cohort studies such as the COVID Infection Survey and GP ele ctronic health record data. After 2 doses, observed vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease with the Delta variant reaches approximately 65 to 70% with AstraZeneca Vaxzevria and 80 Comirnaty and Moderna Spikevax ( 3, 4) Vaccine effectiveness is generally slightly higher in younger compared to older age groups. With both Vaxzevria and Comirnaty, there is evidence of waning of protection over time, most notably among olde r adults. There is not yet enough follow -up with Spikevax to assess waning ( 3). Data (based primarily on the Alpha variant) suggest that in most clinical risk groups, immune response to vaccination is maintained and high levels of V E are seen with both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines. Reduced antibody response and vaccine effectiveness were seen after one dose of vaccine among the immunosuppressed group, however, after a second dose the reduction in vaccine effectiveness is smaller (5). Analyses by dosing interval suggest that immune response to vaccination and vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease improves with a longer (greater than 6 week interval) compared to a shorter interval of 3 to 4 week s (6, 3) COVID -19 vaccine surveillance report - week 42 5 Effectiveness against hospitalisation Several studies have estimated vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation in older ages, all of which indicate higher levels of protection against hospitali sation with all vaccines against the Alpha variant ( 7, 8, 9, 10). Effectiveness against hospitalisation of over 90% is also observed with the Delta variant wit h all 3 vaccine s (3). In most groups there is relatively limited waning of protection against hospitalisation over a period of at least 5 months after the second dose. Greater waning appears to occur among those in clinical risk gro ups ( 3). Effectiveness against mortality High levels of protection (over 90%) are also seen against mortality with all 3 vaccines and against both the Alpha and Delta variants ( 7, 11, 3). Relatively limited waning of protection against mortality is seen over a period of at least 5 months. Effectivenes s against infection Although individuals may not develop symptoms of COVID -19 after vaccination, it is possible that they coul d still be infected with the virus and could transmit to others. Understanding how effective vaccines are at preventing infection is therefore important to predict the likely impact of the vaccination programme on the wider population. In order to estimate vaccine effectiveness against infection, repeat asymptomatic testing of a defined cohort of individuals is required. Studies have now reported on vaccine effectiveness against infection in healthcare workers, care home residents and the general population (12, 13, 14, 15). With the de lta variant, vaccine effectiveness against infection has been estimated at around 65% with Vaxzevria and 80% with Comirnaty ( 4). COVID -19 vaccine surveillance report - week 42 6 Effectiveness against transmission As described above, several studies have provided evidence that va ccines are effective at preventing infection. Uninfected individuals cannot transmit; therefore, the vaccines are also effecti ve at preventing transmission. There may be additional benefit, beyond that due to prevention of infection, if some of those indiv iduals who become infected despite vaccination are also at a reduced risk of transmitting (for example, because of reduced dur ation or level of viral shedding). A household transmission study in England found that household contacts of cases vaccinated wit h a single dose had approximately 35 to 50 % reduced risk of becoming a confirmed case of COVID -19. This study used routine tes ting data so would only include household contacts that developed symptoms and went on to request a test via pillar 2. It cannot e xclude asymptomatic secondary cases or mildly symptomatic cases who chose not to request a COVID -19 test (16). Data from Scotland has also shown that household contacts of vaccinated healthcare workers are at reduced risk of becomi ng a case, which is in line with the studies on infection ( 17). Both of these studies relate to a per iod when the Alpha variant dominated. An analysis from the ONS Community Infection Survey found that contacts of vaccinated index cases had around 65 to 80% reduced odds of testing positive with the Alpha variant and 35 to 65% reduced odds of testing posit ive with the Delta variant compare to contacts of unvaccinated index cases (18). COVID -19 vaccine surveillance report - week 42 8 Populati on impact Vaccines typically have both direct effects on those who are vaccinated and indirect effects on the wider population due to a reduced probability that people will come into contact with an infected individual. The overall im pact of the vaccinatio n programme may therefore extend beyond that estimated through vaccine effectiveness analysis. Estimating the impact of a vaccination programme is challenging as there is no completely unaffected control group. Furthermore, the effec ts of the vaccination programme need to be differentiated from that of other interventions (for example, lockdowns or outbreak control measures), changes in behaviour and any seasonal variation in COVID -19 activity. UKHSA and other government and academic partners monitor the i mpact of the of the vaccination programme on levels of COVID -19 antibodies in the population and different disease indicators, including hospitalisations and mortality. This is done through population - based testing and through modelli ng which combines vacc ine coverage rates in different populations, estimates of vaccine effectiveness and disease surveillance indicators. Vaccine coverage Please note that in order to undertake preparatory work prior to a change in the definition of age-cohorts and to ensure alignment across publications of weekly data, data on vaccine uptake are not being updated this week. Normal publication will resume next week. Daily figures on uptake can be found on the COVID -19 Data Dashboard. The data in this wee k's report covers the p eriod from 8 December 2020 to 10 October 2021 (week 40) (Figure 1 ). It shows the provisional number and percentage of people in England who have had received 1 dose or 2 doses of a COVID -19 vaccination by age group and week since the start of the programme. Up to 3 0 September 2021 8 4,122 women of child -bearing age in England (under 50) who reported that they were pregnant or could be pregnant at the time, received at least one dose of COVID -19 vaccination and of these, 6 7,144 have received their second dose. This is in response to the self -reported pre -screening question \"Are you or could you be pregnant?\". The true number of pregnant women who have had a COVID -19 vaccination is likely to be greater than this. Please note that pregnant women are not a separate priority group as defined by JCVI who have advised that \"women who are pregnant should be offered vaccination at the same time as non-pregnant women, based on their age and clinical risk group\" therefore comp aring vaccine uptake in pregnant women to other vaccination programmes is not currently appropriate. The MHRA closely monitors the safety of COVID -19 vaccine exposures in preg nancy, including Yellow Card reports for COVID -19 vaccines used in pregnancy, for the latest information please see the webpage Coronavirus vaccine - weekly summary of Yellow Card reporting . COVID -19 vaccine surveillance report - week 42 11 Vaccination status Vaccination status of COVID -19 cases, deaths and hospitalisations by week of specimen date over the past 4 weeks up to week 41 (up to 17 October 2021) are shown in Table 2 to 4 and Figure 2. Please note that data on vaccine uptake are not being updated this week, and as such the population sizes used to calculate rates relate to last week's data. Methods COVID -19 cases and deaths identified through routine collection from the Second Generation Surveillance System (SG SS) and from UKHSA EpiCell's deaths data as described here, were linked to the National Immunisation Management System (NIMS) to derive vaccination status, using an individual's NHS number as the unique identif ier. Attendance to emergency care at NHS trusts was derived from the Emergency Care DataSet (ECDS) managed by NHS Digit al. The same data source was used to identify COVID -19 cases where the attendance to emergency care resulted in admission to an NHS trus t. ECDS is updated weekly, and cases are linked to these data twice weekly. Data from ECDS are subject to reporting del ays as, although NHS trusts may update data daily, the mandatory deadline for submission is by the 21st of every month. This means that for weeks immediately following the 21st of a month, numbers may be artificially low and are likely to be higher in late r versions of the report. Data from ECDS also only report on cases who have been presented to emergency care and had a related overnigh t patient admission and do not show those who are currently in hospital with COVID -19. As such, it is not appropriate fo r use for surveillance of those currently hospitalised with COVID -19. In addition, these data will not show cases who were directly admi tted as inpatients without presenting to emergency care. The outcome of overnight inpatient admission following presenta tion to emergency care, was limited to those occurring within 28 days of the earliest specimen date for a COVID -19 case. Deaths include those who died (a) within 28 days of the earliest specimen date or (b) within 60 days of the first specimen date or mor e than 60 days after the first specimen date with COVID - 19 mentioned on the death certificate. The rate of COVID -19 cases, hospitalisati on, and deaths in fully vaccinated and unvaccinated groups was calculated using vaccine coverage data for each age group extracted from the National Immunisation Management Service. COVID -19 vaccine surveillance report - week 42 12 Results The rate of a positive COVID -19 test varies by age and vaccinati on status. The rate of a positive COVID -19 test is substantially lower in vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals up to the age of 29. In individuals aged greater than 30, the rate of a positive COVID -19 test is higher in vaccinated ind ividuals compared to unvaccinated. This is likely to be due to a variety of reasons, including differences in the population of vaccinated and unvaccinated people as well as differences in testing patterns. The rate of hospitalisation within 28 days of a p ositive COVID -19 test increases with age, and is substantially greater in unvaccinated individuals compared to vaccinated individuals. The rate of death within 28 days or within 60 days of a positive COVID -19 test i ncreases with age, and again is substanti ally greater in unvaccinated individuals compared to fully vaccinated individuals . Interpretation of data These data should be considered in the context of vaccination status of the population groups shown in the r est of this report. The vaccination statu s of cases, inpatients and deaths is not the most appropriate method to assess vaccine effectiveness and there is a high risk of misinterpretation. Vaccine effectiveness has been formally estimated from a number of different sources and is described earlie r in this report. In the context of very high vaccine coverage in the population, even with a highly effective vaccine, it is expected that a large proportion of cases, hospitalisations and deaths would occur in va ccinated individuals, simply because a la rger proportion of the population are vaccinated than unvaccinated and no vaccine is 100% effective. This is especially true because vaccination has been prioritised in individuals who are more susceptible or more a t risk of severe disease. Individuals in risk groups may also be more at risk of hospitalisation or death due to non - COVID -19 causes, and thus may be hospitalised or die with COVID -19 rather than because of COVID -19. The case rates in the vaccinated and un vaccinated populations are crude rates th at do not take into account underlying statistical biases in the data. There are likely to be systematic differences in who chooses to be tested and the COVID risk of people who are vaccinated. These biases become more evident as more people are vaccinat ed and the differences between the vaccinated and unvaccinated population become systematically different in ways that are not accounted for without undertaken formal analysis of vaccine effectiveness as is made cle ar. NIMS is used as a denominator becaus e it is a database of named individuals eligible for vaccination in which there is a record of each individual's vaccination status. COVID -19 vaccine surveillance report - week 42 19 Vaccine impact on proportion of population with antibodies to COVID -19 Seroprevalence The results from testing samples provided by health y adult blood donors aged 17 years and older, supplied by the NHS Blood and Transplant (NHS BT collection) between weeks 35 2020 and week 40 2021 are summarised. As of week 44 2020, approximately 250 sampl es from each geographic NHS region are tested each week. The COVID -19 vaccination campaign began on the 8 December 2020 (week 50) with a phased roll out by age and risk group. A booster dose was introduced from 16 September 2021 for individuals aged 50 ye ars and over, frontline health and social care staf f, individuals aged 16 to 49 with certain underlying health conditions and household contacts of immunosuppressed individuals. Booster doses are given at least 6 months after the second dose. Please note t hat this section will be updated monthly. Last upda te was published 21 October 2021. Seroprevalence in blood donors aged 17 years and older The results presented here are based on testing samples with Roche nucleoprotein (N) and Roche spike (S) antibody assays. Nucleoprotein (Roche N) assays only detect post-infection antibodies, whereas spike (Roche S) assays will detect both post -infection antibodies and vaccine -induced antibodies. Thus, changes in seropositivity for the Roche N assay reflect the effec t of natural infection. Increases in seropositivity as measured by S antibody reflect both infection and vaccination. Antibody responses to both targets reflect infection or vaccination occurring at least 2 to 3 weeks previously given the time taken to gen erate a COVID -19 antibody response. Donors have bee n asked to defer donations for at least 7 full days post vaccination, and for at least 28 days post recovery if side -effects following vaccination or COVID -19 infection. This report presents Roche N and R oche S seropositivity estimates on the same set of samples, using a 12 -week rolling prevalence for national, age group and regional estimates. Seropositivity estimates are plotted using the mid -point of a 12 -weekly rolling period that reduces to 8 weeks in the most recent weeks to allow for a more represen tative current estimate of seropositivity. Seroprevalence estimates reported are based on seropositivity which are unadjusted for the sensitivity and specificity of the assays used. This is the first wee k reporting using a 12 -weekly period for national a nd age group estimates. Previously, national and age group seropositivity was reported using a 4 -week rolling period. COVID -19 vaccine surveillance report - week 42 24 Figure 6 shows monthly categorised Roche S levels in N -antibody negative individuals by age group. Almost all tes ted S -antibody negative during December. In the 3 oldest age groups, the impact of first vaccine dose, then second vaccine dose, can be seen from December through June, as the profile of population antibody levels increases. Then from June through Septembe r the profile of antibody levels in these cohorts gradua lly decreases, consistent with waning. During October there is a small increase in percentage of donors with high antibody levels of 1000+ AU/ml for the 70 to 84 age group only, following the initiat ion of the booster programme. The higher profile of antib ody levels in the youngest age group, is likely a result of a combination of factors including stronger immune responses in younger individuals and the higher antibody levels produced after mRNA vacc ination. Figure 7 shows categorised Roche S levels in N -antibody positive individuals, those likely to have experienced past infection. Pre -vaccination antibody levels will be influenced by time since infection, variant and severity of infection, as well as personal factors such as underlying health conditions and age. At the start of the vaccination rollout in December antibody levels typically sat within the range of 0.8 to 1000 AU/ml, after vaccination antibody levels typically exceed 1000 AU/ml. Compar ing Figure 6 with Figure 7, the overall higher profile of antibody levels in those who have experienced past infection is evident; both vaccination post infection and breakthrough infection following vaccination are expected to boost existing antibody leve ls. Researchers across the globe are working to better u nderstand what antibody levels mean in terms of protection against COVID -19. Current thinking is that there is no threshold antibody level that offers complete protection against infection, but inste ad that higher antibody levels are likely to be associate d with lower probability of infection. COVID -19 vaccine surveillance report - week 42 26 Summary of impact on hospitalisations, infections and mortality UKHSA previously reported on the number of hospitalisations directly averted by vaccination . In total, around 261,500 hospitalisations have be en prevented in those aged 45 years and over up to 19 September 2021. UKHSA and University of Cambridge M RC Biostatistics Unit previously reported on the direct and indirect impact of the v accination programme on infections and mortality. Estimates s ugges t that 127,5 00 deaths and 2 4,144 ,000 infections have been prevented as a result of the COVID - 19 vaccination programme, up to 24 September. Neither of these models will be updated going forw ard. This is due to these models being unable to account for the i nterventions that would have been implemented in the absence of vaccination. Consequently, over time the state of the actual pandemic and the no -vaccination pandemic scenario have become inc reasingly less comparable.
