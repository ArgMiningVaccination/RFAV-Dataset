NDs are formally trained in lifestyle counseling to assess, recognize, understand and provide appropriate treatment options for behavioral issues that interfere with a patient's health and wellbeing. They might use counseling strategies, hypnotherapy, meditation, biofeedback, and other stress management techniques. Where necessary, NDs will refer patients to other health practitioners with expertise in behavioral health. "}
