INTRODUCTION Kamb\u00f4 is the Mats\u00e9 name for the secretion of the Giant Leaf Frog (Phyllomedusa bicolor), which is ritually used by different ethnicities in the Amazon basin of Brazil and Peru [1](#ref-1). A variety of potent bioactive peptides have been identified [1](#ref-1). Kamb\u00f4 is obtained from the frog by carefully tying it up and rubbing its skin with a hard instrument, collecting the secretion on a wooden stick. It has been emphasized that in most cases the frog is treated with utmost respect and caution, in order to not harm it, and released it to its natural habitat once that the secretion is collected [3](#ref-3). Given its low oral bioavailability, Kamb\u00f4 is most commonly applied by the applicator to the recipient via several fresh superficial burns (\"dots\") on the arms, legs or chest [4](#ref-4). Anecdotally, it has been described that within minutes, the secretion likely enters the lymphatic system and subsequently the blood, thereby inducing an intense reaction that includes hypotension, sweating, tachycardia, heavy vomiting and edema, usually subsiding within an hour. This is followed by listlessness or sleep and, subsequently, a state \"perhaps to be described as euphoric\", characterized by increased stamina and clarity of thoughts with an increased capacity for hunting [1](#ref-1). In Amazonian ethnicities, Kamb\u00f4 is used as a cleansing ritual to liberate hunters from \"bad principles\" or bad luck in hunting (\"panema\"), enhancing the recipient's capacities once that cleansing has occurred and acute effects have subsided [5](#ref-5). During the last 20 years, Kamb\u00f4 has found its way to Western urban centers in Brazil and all over the world [6](#ref-6). Notably, to date none of the substances that have been identified in the Kamb\u00f4 secretion display any serotonergic activity. However, from its Amazonian origins to its use in the context of Brazilian syncretic religions like the Santo Daime and the Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal [5](#ref-5) and, finally, to its use in Western healing circles, Kamb\u00f4 has often been associated with the spread of the serotonergic psychedelic ayahuasca [7](#ref-7). Ayahuasca is an Amazonian different plants, including plants (e.g. Psychotria the serotonergic psychedelic that render N,N-DMT orally active [8](#ref-8). Notably, Kamb\u00f4 does not necessarily have to be applied by a shaman and is not considered as a shamanic ritual itself, in contrast to ayahuasca and other ritual plants, where use is restricted to a shamanic framework [9](#ref-9). During its spread to Western urban centers, however, the Kamb\u00f4 ritual has been transformed from a hunting ritual into therapeutic approaches and a neo-shamanic healing ritual, a process which has been labeled as \"shamanization of Kamb\u00f4\" [10](#ref-10). The association with ayahuasca, however, is not the only connection between Kamb\u00f4 and nature-derived serotonergic psychedelics. Notably, different \"Kamb\u00f4\", \"kampu\", \"vaccino da floresta\" and which incorrectly means \"toad\" in Spanish. This variability of the terms has sometimes led to a confusion of Kamb\u00f4 with the secretion of the Sonoran Desert Toad (Bufo alvarius), which is also referred to as \"sapo\" [7](#ref-7). In contrast to Kamb\u00f4, however, bufotenine, which is or snorted, immediately inducing strong psychedelic experiences [12](#ref-12). Given the different application routes, the two substances are usually not confused by users, even though ceremonies where secretions from Kamb\u00f4 and Bufo alvarius are combined have recently been proposed in Western psychedelic circles. Another interesting overlap between Kamb\u00f4 and the use of plant-derived psychedelics can be found in anecdotal reports describing beneficial after-effects on wellbeing, medical and mental health problems and personal and spiritual development [13](#ref-13) - attributes which have previously been associated with the use of serotonergic psychedelics. Of note, the effects of serotonergic psychedelics underlie unique temporal dynamics, with distinct acute (\"psychedelic experiences\" or \"states\") and subacute effects (\"afterglow\" phenomena) [14](#ref-14). Afterglow phenomena have been conceptualized as states of \"elevated and energetic mood with a relative freedom from concerns of the past and from guilt and anxiety\", which are associated with an enhanced willingness \"to enter into close interpersonal relationships\", lasting between two weeks and a month [15](#ref-15). If these effects are comparable to the aftereffects of Kamb\u00f4 is an open question. Despite the close cultural and sub-cultural associations between the use of Kamb\u00f4 and different nature-derived psychedelics, no systematic characterization of the acute or subacute effects of Kamb\u00f4 has been reported. Here, we report results of a paper-pencil study among Kamb\u00f4 users employing standardized and validated questionnaires to retrospectively report acute and subacute effects of Kamb\u00f4. This assessment allows a direct comparison to data from other psychoactive substances and answers in how far the effects of Kamb\u00f4 display similarities with serotonergic psychedelics [16](#ref-16). Our study was designed to (1) systematically characterize the acute effects of Kamb\u00f4, enabling a direct comparison to acute effects of e.g. plant-derived serotonergic psychedelics, (2) explore if Kamb\u00f4 displays subacute effects which might be comparable to the psychedelic afterglow phenomena, including retrospective appraisal of the experiences by the recipients. RESULTS Sample characteristics N = 27 datasets were sent back to us, of which n = 5 were excluded due to an insufficient reliability index in the PCI (cut-off h > 2), leaving a final dataset of n = 22 for the first part of the study. The consecutive part of the study on the subacute effects of Kamb\u00f4 was completed by n = 14, where one PEQ dataset and one CS dataset were excluded due to inappropriate completion, leaving for each n=13 datasets. The sample characteristics are summarized in [Table 1](#T1). With regards to lifetime drug consumption, 15 participants (68.2%) reported experiences with serotonergic hallucinogens (e.g., LSD, DMT, DOM), and 19 (86.4%) reported experiences with ritual plants or traditional indigenous medicines (e.g., ayahuasca, peyote, San Pedro, psilocybin mushrooms, ibogaine, 5-MeO-DMT, bufotenin). Participants reported consumption of other psychotropic substances in their lifetime as follows: cannabis (n = 21, 95.5%), opioids (n = 7, 32.8%), cocaine (n = 10, 45.5%), amphetamine (n = 13, 59.1%), MDMA (n = 15, 68.2%), tranquilizer (n = 4, 18.2%). Participants were asked to report on the importance of spiritual practices in their life on a scale from (0 = \"not at all\" to 100 = \"extraordinarily important\"), which resulted in an average of 72.7% (\u00b1 21.8%). Acute subjective effects of Kamb\u00f4 The Kamb\u00f4 secretion was administered for n = 15 (68.2%) participants by an alternative health practitioner, western healer or \"neo-shaman\". In n = 2 (9.1%) cases an indigenous shaman and in n = 3 (13.6%) cases a layperson was reported to have administered Kamb\u00f4 (n = 1 \"other\" and n = 1 not specified). N = 14 (63.6%) of the participants reported being the only client while receiving Kamb\u00f4, while n = 7 (31.8%) received it in a group setting (n = 1 not specified). The setting and environment was described as follows: a healing place or temple (n = 11, 52.4%), at home (n = 4, 19.0%), in nature (n = 2, 9.5%), in a ceremony (n = 2, 9.5%), other (n = 2, 9.5%), in a friend's home (n = 1, 4.8%), with an alternative health practitioner practice (n = 1, 4.8%), at a festival (n = 1, 4.8%), on vacation (n = 1, 4.8%). Participants reported that Kamb\u00f4 was applied via an average of 7 \u00b1 2 burning points on the participants' skin. The acute experience lasted less than 15 minutes for n = 6 (27.3%) participants, between 30 and 59 minutes for n = 11 (50.0%) participants, 60 minutes or longer for n = 3 (13.6%) participants (n = 2 not specified). We asked participants explicitly if they thought that Kamb\u00f4 induces a \"Rauschzustand\" (German word for \"inebriation\" or \"high\"), and n = 5 (22.7 %) reported \"Yes\". Acute effects were assessed retrospectively using the ASC rating scale, the PCI, the MEQ and CEQ to assess altered state experiences allowing for direct comparison to hallucinogenic substances and non-pharmacological methods that elucidate psychotropic effects. [Figure 1](#F1) and [Table 2](#T2) summarize results of ASC rating scale, the PCI, MEQ30 and CEQ. Subacute subjective effects of Kamb\u00f4 The PEQ and the CS were filled in only when the exemplary Kamb\u00f4 session happened 2 - 3 weeks before filling in the questionnaires. Together these questionnaires cover a broad spectrum of subjectively experienced subacute effects. Results are summarized in [Figure 2](#F2) and [Table 3](#T3). When asked about the spiritual relevance of the Kamb\u00f4 experiences, n = 6 of 13 (46%) participants rated it as strongly spiritually significant, including n = 2 participants who rated it as the single most or among the five most spiritually significant experiences of their life. When asked how personally meaningful the experience was, n = 7 of 13 (54%) participants rated the experience among the ten most meaningful experiences of their life and n = 4 rated it among the five most personally meaningful experience. One participant viewed it as the single most personally meaningful experience in his life. Regarding change of well-being or life satisfaction, n = 8 of 13 (62%) participants stated that the experience increased well-being or life satisfaction slightly, and n = 5 of 13 (38%) participants reported an increase in well-being or life satisfaction between 'moderate' and 'very much'. DISCUSSION In our study investigating effects of Kamb\u00f4 - the secretion of the Giant Maki Frog (Phyllomedusa bicolor) - on human consciousness, we report three major findings: (1) Regarding the acute period of the pharmacological action, only subtle effects on consciousness were recorded, not comparable to serotonergic psychedelics with regard to qualitative aspects and intensity; (2) Participants reported positive subacute after-effects, which in some aspects showed overlaps with psychedelic \"afterglow\" phenomena; (3) About half of the participants retrospectively appraised their experiences with Kamb\u00f4 as both highly spiritually and personally relevant for their lives, analogous to appraisals of mystical experiences reported under high dosages of serotonergic psychedelics. The acute effects of Kamb\u00f4 In the first part of our study, we set out to test if Kamb\u00f4 induces acute altered states of consciousness (ASCs) comparable to psychedelics. The core of psychedelic experience is currently best assessed with the 11D-ASC questionnaire, the most commonly used tool to assess drug-induced ASCs. The 11D-ASC allows for characterization of subjective effects along 11 dimensions of change in conscious experience. Psychedelic experiences are typically characterized by high scores on the scales Elementary and Complex Imagery, Insightfulness, Spiritual Experience, Experience of Unity and Blissful State [16](#ref-16). In contrast, for Kamb\u00f4 we found only relatively low scores on these dimensions. Thus, our study demonstrates with standardized questionnaire data that Kamb\u00f4 does not elicit effects on consciousness comparable to serotonergic psychedelics, especially no comparable effects are reported on perception and thinking. Moreover, we applied the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ). This tool is used to test for the occurrence of spiritual/mystical experiences, which are thought to have the potential to facilitate conversions, attitude-changes, or even life-changes under special circumstances. High values of \"full-blown\" mystical experiences have been reported for several LSD [17](#ref-17), psilocybin [18](#ref-18), and 5-methoxy-dimethyltryptamine [19](#ref-19). In our sample, few participants reported pronounced aspects of mystical experiences, reflected by relatively low mean scores on the four MEQ factors, with a few higher outlier datapoints. Even if Kamb\u00f4 effects cannot be compared to intense mystical experiences as reported after the use of serotonergic psychedelics [20](#ref-20) with regard to intensity and completeness of the mystical state, our finding suggests that participants might have experienced psychological and spiritual effects beyond merely somatic reactions. However, this conclusion remains somewhat speculative, and setting as well as expectational and setting factors could have contributed to this effect. The Challenging Experience Questionnaire (CEQ) includes self-report items designed for the investigation of challenging experiences under psilocybin and other serotonergic psychedelics. These include fear, grief, physical distress, insanity, isolation, fear of death and paranoia, which are symptoms that can occur in challenging experiences (also referred to as \"bad trips\") under serotonergic psychedelics [21](#ref-21). The challenging experiences reported for acute effects of Kambo were mostly limited to \"physical distress\". Challenging experiences of a rather psychological nature were barely reported - suggesting unspecific fearful reactions to the strong vegetative effects, but without induction of psychedelic-type psychological crises including insanity, isolation, death or paranoid ideation in the sense of \"bad trips\", reflecting distortions of ego functions and self-processing. Ratings on the Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory (PCI) allow for comparison of Kambo experiences with hypnosis or meditation techniques to investigate potential shared aspects. Similar to hypnotic or meditative states, participants reported a reduction of positive and negative affect in their Kamb\u00f4 experiences (Pekala 2017). With regard to the question if or how Kamb\u00f4 elicits psychoactive effects, it is noteworthy that the obtained scores on \"self-awareness\", \"rationality\", \"attention\" and \"memory\" indicate that the participants did not feel confused or muddled, which would be expected from centrally active drugs like alcohol or barbiturates. Taken together, our study provides standardized data that allows a direct comparison of Kamb\u00f4 experiences to the effects of well-known psychoactive substances. On the physiological level, the acute Kamb\u00f4 experience is dominated by an intensive physical reaction, which is reflected in the reports of \"physical distress\" by our participants and is also likely to have triggered psychological distress in some participants. The process of characterizing acute Kamb\u00f4 effects with standardized questionnaires in the present study revealed that Kambo induces a state of self-centered inwardness. This state does not have typical characteristics of psychedelic-induced states. Although the pharmacodynamics of the Kamb\u00f4 secretion have only been partially investigated, it has been suggested that Kamb\u00f4's pharmacological effects are restricted to the cardiovascular, gastroenterological, endocrine and immune systems, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the endogenous opioid system [9](#ref-9). On the one hand, this appears to be plausible given the compounds' peptide structures which prevent them from passing the blood-brain barrier. On the other hand, the authors hypothesize that the neuropeptide opioids in Kamb\u00f4 (dermorphin, caerulein and could for the observed \"alterations of consciousness\", suggesting psychoactive effects. However, given the neuropeptide structure, these opioids have been reported to be centrally active via intrathecal application only. In addition, the described acute and subacute effects of Kamb\u00f4 resemble stimulant effects rather than those of substances with mu-receptor activity. Thus, the observed acute and subacute effects in our sample are divergent from known psychoactive effects of mu-receptor agonists, suggesting that other compounds or complex interactions between vegetative, neuro-endocrinological and psychological effects might be considered as underlying biological correlates of the Kamb\u00f4 experience. Nevertheless, to date no compounds have been identified that could explain the induction of an ASC during the acute period of Kamb\u00f4 effects and no such phenomena were reported by our participants. The subacute effects of Kamb\u00f4 In the second part of our study, we investigated subacute effects of Kamb\u00f4 up to 2-3 weeks after the reported exemplary session to find first indications if these effects were comparable to psychedelic afterglow phenomena (See [14](#ref-14)). Since no systematic characterization of afterglow phenomena exists to date, even for psychedelics, a quantitative comparison was not possible. Therefore, as a first description of the subacute effects we used the PEQ, previously applied to characterize psychedelic effects mainly in therapeutic contexts. Additionally, we used a questionnaire measuring connectedness, which has not yet been validated. Notably, subacute effects of Kamb\u00f4 were appraised very positively, including mood\", \"altruistic\" and \"positive behavioural changes\", whereas negative aspects have been reported to be negligible. This is in line with observations describing a euphoric state after the acute effects of Kamb\u00f4 have subsided [1](#ref-1). Moreover, subacute effects involved dimensions of mood, overall wellbeing, but also aspects on a spiritual and transpersonal level. The intensity of subacute positive effects was pronounced, even if not as intense as after-effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) [22](#ref-22) or psilocybin [23](#ref-23). Interestingly, the ratings of items describing connectedness to internal aspects of oneself were high in our sample, such as being connected to \"my senses\", \"a range and \"insight/intuition\", and to \"have been fully able to experience emotion, whether positive or negative\". In contrast, ratings of items referring to connectedness to external aspects (e.g. source of universal love\") were far less pronounced, except for the experience of being \"connected to nature\". This is in line with anecdotal observations including participants' subjective experiences of an active interaction with a frog's \"spirit\", which detects and eliminates toxins and bad energy from their mind and body [9](#ref-9). However, this finding is only partially comparable to mystical experiences associated with acute and subacute effects of serotonergic psychedelics, where states of increased connectedness to both the self and other beings have been reported [23](#ref-23)(i.e. the notion that \"everything is interconnected\"). Notably, even if the subacute effects were not comparable to those reported after the use of serotonergic psychedelics regarding intensity and qualitative aspects [22](#ref-22), [23](#ref-23), some of the phenomena which outlasted the acute effects were surprisingly intensive and complex, showing overlaps with psychedelic \"afterglow phenomena\", including increases in positive mood, behavior, attitudes and social interaction. Limitations The effects of Kamb\u00f4 reported by our study participants could partially be related to the ritualistic setting of consumption. Our data were collected retrospectively from a group of Western Kamb\u00f4 users recruited through a public workshop on Kamb\u00f4 and a group of practitioners devoted to a specific ritual setting. This might have induced a bias of expectations or motivations for use and thereby involved the placebo dimension. The observed variability in the assessed acute effects suggests that expectational factors and setting might have played a role for some reports. In order to make final conclusions about the psychoactive properties of Kamb\u00f4, randomized placebo-controlled trials are necessary. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate that the acute effects of Kamb\u00f4 are very different from the effects of serotonergic psychedelics. While the acute effects of Kamb\u00f4 are dominated by strong physical reactions followed by a state of increased inwardness, psychedelic effects appear to facilitate loosening of ego barriers and increased connectedness with oneself and the outer world. Our findings are congruent with anecdotal reports that the subacute effects of Kamb\u00f4 include feelings of being energized with increased stamina and clarity of thoughts, following an initial state of physical sickness and exhaustion. Nevertheless, subacutely, Kamb\u00f4 does exhibit some overlap with serotonergic psychedelics in regard to the reported \"afterglow\" phenomenon [15](#ref-15). This finding is striking given the unique temporal dynamics of subacute psychedelic effects, incomparable to any other group of psychoactive substances. Kamb\u00f4 thereby appears to be associated with afterglow-like effects, but without preceding psychedelic states. In agreement with our findings, it has been suggested that the transformative and transpersonal effects of Kamb\u00f4 might be comparable to those associated with the use of serotonergic psychedelics [9](#ref-9). METHODS Participants and Procedure All data of this study was collected anonymously. Potential participants were recruited at a drug information event in Berlin and through Kamb\u00f4 practitioners who forwarded study material to their clients. Participants were informed about the study aim and that data collection is fully anonymously. They were handed out a printed set of paper/pencil-questionnaires together with a prepaid envelope for returning completed sets of questionnaires and gave consent by filling the questionnaire and sending it back anonymously. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the Ethics committee of the Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin (EA2/185/17). All questionnaires were applied in German. The first set of questions addressed person specific characteristics, such as age, gender and drug consumption history. Apart from questions referring to demographic information, a set of questionnaires was given to the participants that comprised the following two parts: (1) questionnaires on the acute effects of an exemplary Kamb\u00f4 session, (2) questionnaires on subacute effects of the exemplary Kamb\u00f4 session. All participants were requested to fill in demographic information and (1). Participants were asked to fill in (2) only if the exemplary Kamb\u00f4 session that they reported about in (1) happened between 2 - 3 weeks ago, as the questions on the acute effects addressed this period after the Kamb\u00f4 session. As exclusion criterion for data of insufficient quality we used the reliability index (h) of the Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory (PCI), which is a measure for the participants consistency in completing the questionnaire [24](#ref-24). Assessment of acute subjective effects of Kamb\u00f4 The second set of questions comprised four well established and validated psychometric tools to assess acute subjective experiences of consciousness alterations: Altered States of Consciousness (ASC) Rating Scale The ASC rating scale [25](#ref-25), [26](#ref-26) originated from two former versions, States; GERMAN: OAV [30](#ref-30) and has become one of the most frequently used questionnaires in the assessment of altered states of consciousness phenomena. The ASC rating scale is supposed to investigate characteristics of consciousness alterations that are invariant across various conditions including both pharmacological (e.g., psilocybin, ketamine, DMT) and behavioral induction methods (e.g., sensory deprivation, hypnosis, autogenic training). Over the course of more than 30 years, the questionnaire underwent several refinements finally leading to the currently used version which comprises 94 items [25](#ref-25), [26](#ref-26). Currently two different analysis schemata are used: the scheme (5D-ASC) and the 11-dimensional scheme (11D-ASC) [31](#ref-31). Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory (PCI) The PCI was developed in the context of an interdisciplinary approach described as empirical-phenomenology [24](#ref-24), [32](#ref-32). Most notably influenced by C. T. Tart's (1975) conception of ASCs, where different states are characterized by distinct structures and patterns of the subjective experience [24](#ref-24) (p. 192). The PCI assesses subjective experiences along multiple dimensions, where corresponding scales were constructed on the basis of several cluster and factor analyses. Items are presented as two opposing statements (e.g. \"I felt ecstatic and joyful\" - \"I felt no feelings of being ecstatic and joyful\") located on the two poles of a 7-point Likert scale. We used the German version by [33](#ref-33). Mystical Experiences Questionnaire (MEQ) The MEQ was first used in the 'Good Friday Experiment' [34](#ref-34), [35](#ref-35), where it was intended to assess differences regarding aspects of mystical experience between a group taking psilocybin and a control group taking a placebo. Since then, the MEQ has been applied as an instrument for the quantitative assessment of pharmacologically induced mystical experience. Items of the MEQ were chosen based on literature about mysticism including first-person accounts as well as theoretical work, most notably by W. James (1902) and W. T. Stace (1960). The initial MEQ has been further developed by Pahnke (1969), Richards (1975), Griffiths et al. (2006; 2011), and MacLean et al. (2012). The most recent version is the MEQ30 [36](#ref-36), a condensed version of the MEQ with thirty items and four empirical scales [37](#ref-37), [38](#ref-38). Challenging Experiences Questionnaire (CEQ) The CEQ was designed to provide a tool for the comprehensive assessment of acute negative effects of temporarily induced altered states of consciousness [39](#ref-39), based on three questionnaires: Hallucinogenic Rating Scale (HRS), 5D-ASC, and States of Consciousness Questionnaire (SOCQ). The conceptual scope of the 26-item CEQ is informed by literature on psychological and physical distress following hallucinogen intake and covers a variety of adverse cognitive, affective, and somatic reactions which are clustered into seven distinct dimensions of challenging experiences [37](#ref-37). Analyzing data from an online survey on negative experiences with psilocybin, corresponding scales for the first six dimension were derived by exploratory factor analysis, complemented by the Paranoia scale, and subsequently validated through confirmatory factor analysis [39](#ref-39). Items are rated on a 6-point scale adopted from the SOCQ. Assessment of subacute subjective effects of Kamb\u00f4 The third set of questionnaires addressing subacute effects was introduced with the instructions to fill out the following questionnaires only if the exemplary Kambo session (for which the acute effects were reported) had happened up to 3 weeks before the day of completing the questionnaire. The set of questions comprised the following two questionnaires: Items about Connectedness We used a previously unpublished set of 23 questions to measure different aspects of connectedness [40](#ref-40). The items include aspects of connectedness to one's self, connectedness to the universe and connectedness to others. The items stem from the development of a connectedness scale (CS). As no validation or confirmation of a factor structure had been published until now, the scores on this scale are presented for the individual items. Persisting Effects Questionnaire (PEQ) The PEQ was developed as a follow-up questionnaire to the States of Consciousness Questionnaire (SOCQ), which was an intermediate version of the MEQ [20](#ref-20). The PEQ assesses long-term changes in participants. We used a German version of the extended PEQ version reported in [23](#ref-23). This version uses 140 items rated on a 6-point Likert scale from 0 ('not at all') to 5 ('extremely'), and 3 items on the retrospective assessment of the importance and effects of the experiences. Data Analysis and Visualization Questionnaire data were analyzed using standardized analysis sheets. Data visualization was performed with RStudio v.1.2.1335 and package ggplot2 v.3.2.1. Boxplots represent the lower and upper hinges corresponding to the first and third quartiles (the 25th and 75th percentiles), the median as a horizontal bar and the whiskers indicate the range of the data (limited to 1.5 x interquartile range). Discrete individual data points are shown as green dots. To display overlapping data points the size of the dots represents the number of observations at each value. Data points not lying within the range of the whiskers are outliers. The mean, without any outlier exclusion, is displayed as a diamond shape. For comparability with previous reports, the means and SD for all questionnaire data are provided in [Table 2](#T2) (without outlier exclusion).
