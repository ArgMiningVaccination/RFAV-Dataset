More immediately, there are many people who have at one time or another given invaluable encouragement, support or advice. It is notpossible to acknowledge all, except to mention a few early exampleswhen this work was at its very beginning. Sir Arnold Burgen, F.R.S.,while at McGill, has through his teaching and discussions initiatedmy deep interest in the area of membrane and cell physiology. In1956, he supported my request to Professor F. C. MacIntosh, F.R.S.,then Chairman of the Department of Physiology, to move my researchfrom my dormitory room to a corner of the teaching laboratory inthe department. Professor MacIntosh has, in addition, given me muchencouragement and support at the beginning. In 1962, Professor S.G. Mason, was interested in using my 1957 articial cells for someof his rheology experiments and invited me to his laboratory forsix months. I am thankful to the Canadian biomedical scientists fortheir open enthusiasm and standing ovation when I rst presentedthis study at the Annual Conference of the Canadian Federation ofBiological Societies in 1963. This and the acceptance of my paper asthe sole author by Science in 1964, suggested to me that this research might have some future potential for use in medicine. This played animportant role in my decision to continue with the research ratherthan to go into clinical practice. Professor D. V. Bates, then Chairmanof the Department of Physiology, for his support and help in greatlyexpanding my research facilities. Professor J. Beck, Physician-in-Chiefof the RoyalVictoria Hospital, for his support in my rst clinical trials on viiApril 13, 2007 13:48 SPI-B446 hemoperfusion and the nephrologists at the McGill Teaching hospitals for referring their patients to me to carry out the hemoperfusionprocedures \u2014 especially Dr. A. Gonda, Dr. Paul Barre, Dr. M. Levy, andDr. J Dirks. My uncle, Professor Robert SM Chang, especially for hisadvice on academic \"protocols.\" Professor S. Freedman, while deanof medicine, recognized this research effort as the Articial Cells andOrgans Research Centre at McGill University. My sincere appreciationalso goes to Professor W. Kolff, Professor A. Burton, Professor O.Denstedt, and many others for their interests, encouragement, andsupport especially in the early phase of this research. This includedprofessors, chairmen of departments, deans of faculties, vice-principalsand principals at McGill University and the many colleagues aroundthe world. This research would not have been possible without my wife, Lancy. Through her cheerful acceptance she has made it possible for me to combine this research with the heavy load of a medical student inthe early years. Since 1958, in addition to her moral support, she haslooked after everything for me at home and even in my ofce so asto allow me to concentrate completely and fully on my research andother academic activities. She has also contributed extensively to thismonograph by carrying out the very time consuming and laborioustask of inputting, typing, arranging and editing the very large referencesection. It has been a pleasure to work in my laboratory with the many past and present graduate students, research fellows, research assistants,research associates and others, especially (alphabetically): Barre, P,Bourget, L, Bruni, S, Cameron, D, Campbell J, Cattaneo, M, Chang,H, Chang, V, Chawla, AS, Chirito, E, Chow, KM, Chuang, S, Coffey,JF, Cole, C, Coromili, V, Cousineau, J, Hertzman, CM, Hewish,M, Holeczek, K, Ilan, E, Y, L, Kashani, SA, Keipert, PE,Khanna, R, Kuntarian, N, Kuruvilla, Mohsini, K, D, Morton, P, Nalchesky, P, Nasielski,P, Ning, J, Nishiya, T, O'Keefe, P, S, Reiter, B, Resurrecci\u00b4 on, E, A, Rong, J, Rosenthal, AM, Safos, S, Sarkissian, CN, Shi, ZQ, Shu, CD, Sipehia, Stark, Y, Tani, T, Taroy, E, Varma,R, Verzosa, A, Wahl, HP, Walter, S, Watson W, Wong, H, Wong, N, Yu,BL,Yu, WP,Yu,YT,Yuan, ZY, Zheng, WH, Zhou, MX, Zolotareva, gratefully acknowledge the nancial support as follows: My parents in the rst summer of 1957. The Faculty of Medicine atMcGill for support throughout the next three summers. When thisresearch was carried out on a full time basis from 1962, theMedical Research Council of Canada for the research support and forthe awards, respectively, as Medical Research Fellow (1962-1965),Medical Research Council Scholar (1965-1968), and MRC CareerInvestigator from 1968 until the end of the career investigator programin 1999. After the MRC became the new Canadian Institutes of HealthResearch, it continued with ongoing research supports. When theQuebec Ministry of Education, Science and Technology started thenew \"Virage Centre of Excellence in High Technology\" program, theyawarded me one of the rst centers. The Bayer/Canadian Red CrossSociety/Medical Research Council of Canada Joint Funds program hadsupported my research on blood substitutes even before the H.I.V.crisis in donor blood. The more recent Quebec Ministry of Health'sHemovigillance and Transfusion Medicine Program has awarded meits rst Research Group (d'equipe) to work on \"Biomedical Researchon Blood Substitutes inTransfusion Medicine.\" In addition to the abovemajor long-term research supports, there were also smaller and shorterterm research supports from other agencies and organizations over thelast many years. It has been a pleasure to accept the invitation of World Scientic Publishing to prepare this monograph. Their scientic editor, Ms.SC Lim, has been most helpful throughout the preparation of thismonograph.April 13, 2007 13:48 SPI-B446 Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... fm This page intentionally left blankThis page intentionally left blankApril 13, 2007 13:48 SPI-B446 Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... fm Contents Dedication v Acknowledgements vii Chapter 1. 50th Anniversary of Articial Cells 1 1.1.

It is a personal \"story\" on the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of the rst report on articial cells,aimed at answering the following questions. Why articial cells andwhat are they? Where and how were they rst prepared? What is thetime line of the new ideas related to articial cells since they were rstreported 50 years ago? 1.1. Background Back in the 1950s, Professor F.C. MacIntosh, chairman of Physiology,and Sir Arnold Burgen started a special \"honors physiology\" programin the faculty of medicine at McGill University. The farsighted andchallenging program consisted of advance cell physiology combinedwith advance courses in polymer chemistry, physical chemistry andradiation chemistry. I was one of the four chosen to be the \"guineapigs\" for this new program and it started my interest in applying basicresearch to medical treatment. The problem was where to start. We all feel humble in the face of the ingenuity and complexity of nature. Yet, it need not prevent us from studying, examining and evenattempting to prepare clinically useful systems having a few of thesimpler properties of their natural counterparts. Indeed, working ona molecular level, researchers at that time had already synthesized anumber of biological molecules. However, on the cellular level, despite the basic importance of cells, no one seemed to be interested in \"articial cells.\" Perhaps this waspremature, since our basic knowledge of biological cells was still 1April 2, 2007 12:5 SPI-B446 Articial Regenerative... ch01 Articial Cells incomplete. Yet, organ substitutes like Kolff's articial kidneys were hardly an exact replicas of their biological counterparts. Despite this,these substitutes were already an accepted method of treatment forkidney failure patients at that time. Thus, I thought that to prepareclinically useful articial cells, one might not have to prepare replicasof biological cells. 1.2. Starting with Articial Red Blood Cells Being an uninitiated beginner, I thought that one can easily preparearticial red blood cells for use in patients. After all, red blood cells areone of the simplest biological cells. Furthermore, there are practicalreasons for doing this. Red blood cells are the best material for use intransfusion, but as shown in Fig. 1.1, there are a number of problemsinvolved. Articial red blood cells would solve many of these problems(Fig. 1.1). When I asked around for a method to do this, I was politely told that I was asking for the impossible task of preparing a water emulsionsuspended in water. Most people were also taken back by this \"far-fetched\" idea. Fortunately, my parents have instilled in me the sensethat hard work and determination can turn impossible ideas intopossibilities.They cited my grandfather as an example of someone whowas able to build a manufacturing empire in Swatow (Shantou), startingwith nothing as a poor preacher's son. Thus, I quietly and stubbornlystarted some simple experiments in my dormitory room at McGill'sDouglas Hall of residence. Beginner's luck plus the excellent teachingin advance cell physiology and advance chemistry had allowed me toprepare some very crude articial red blood cells. I showed this preliminary result to Sir Arnold Burgen and he was most enthusiastic. He helped me persuade the chairman, ProfessorMacIntosh, to let me use this research for the required honorsphysiology research project. The department assigned me a corner ofthe teaching laboratory. By working out a drop method to rst preparelarger articial red blood cells (Fig. 1.2), I was able to use this principle,but using emulsication to prepare microscopic articial Regenerative... ch01 FA 50th Anniversary of Articial Cells 3 Fig. 1.1.

For the grading of this research project, the department asked for a sample of the articial red blood cells. It was a relief whenProfessor Sekelj's analysis supported my oxygen dissociation curve andthe research report was approved (Chang, 1957). The extrusion drop method has become the basis for extension and modications of methods for preparing articial cells to encapsulatebiological cells. The emulsion method has also become the basis forfurther extensions and modications of the methods for the preparationof articial cells of microscopic or nano dimension in nanotechnology.Because of this, the complete report including methods of preparationis reprinted in Appendix I in this monograph for interest and reference. The original project report has always been available in the McGill Medical Library. Part of this report was published in the 30th Anniversary Symposium volume (Chang 1988c). 1.3. Further Research and the First Routine Clinical Use of Articial Cells Over the next 5 years of my medical school and internship, the department continued to let me use the teaching laboratory space,providing me with summer salary support from the Faculty ofMedicine. After this, since no one at McGill was carrying out relatedresearch, a Ph.D. committee was put together. In addition, ProfessorMacIntosh wrote a supporting letter for my submission to Science as the sole author of this work. This was under the condition that I use thetitle \"semipermeable microcapsules\" instead of my original pretentioustitle of \"Articial cells.\" Science accepted and published the paper (Chang, 1964). The Ph.D. thesis was also entitled \"Semipermeableaqueous microcapsules\" instead of \"Articial cells\" (Chang, 1965).It is interesting to note that no one, including myself, knew preciselywhat \"semipermeable microcapsules\" meant. The outcome was thatvery few researchers followed up on this research for many years tocome! The delay of others entering this line of research means thatmost of the earlier research in this area has been carried out in mylaboratory.April 2, 2007 12:5 SPI-B446 Articial Regenerative... ch01 FA 6 Articial Cells In addition to the operating grant and career investigator award from the Medical Research Council of Canada (the present CanadianInstitutes of Health Research), I was later awarded a large specialprogram grant by the council. I took this as a challenge to show thatall my ndings about the potential implications of articial cells canactually be put into clinical practice. With this, I was able to developarticial cells which contain absorbents for use in hemoperfusion forthe treatment of suicidal patients or patients involved in accidental useof sleeping pills and other medications. However, this being a very newapproach, other physicians were initially concerned about medicalliability. Thus, rst worked out a way to scale up the preparation. Afterthis, I carried out preclinical animal safety and efcacy studies as wellas clinical treatment of patients. This required a lot of work and washighly time consuming; it was possible because of the unselsh supportof my wife, Lancy, who knew the importance of this work for patients. Among many other things, she waited for more than 10 years before our rst honeymoon. The result was hemoperfusion based on articialcells, being carried out routinely around the world for the treatmentof suicidal and accidental uses of medications in adult and pediatricpatients. In the meantime, I was completing an invited monograph for Charles C. Thomas Publisher and it contained a detailed descriptionof methods. On becoming a tenured full professor in 1972, Iimmediately had this published (Chang 1972a). The advantageof having \"tenure\" is that it enabled me to safely use thetitle \"Articial cells\" instead of \"Semipermeable microcapsules\"for this monograph! This self explanatory title and the detaileddescription of methods, combined with interests in the clinicaluse of articial cells in hemoperfusion, led to a sudden surge ofresearch activities in this area around the world. However, at thattime the industries were mainly concerned with the developmentand use of articial cells for hemoperfusion and Regenerative... ch01 FA 50th Anniversary of Articial Cells 7 1.4. Importance of Progress in Parallel Areas of Biotechnology, Molecular Biology, andRegenerative Medicine Most of my original ideas and basic research were related to enzyme and gene therapy, cell therapy, blood substitutes, regenerativemedicine, nanomedicine and related areas. Developing these foractual clinical use required parallel developments in molecularbiology and biotechnology that were not yet available. More recently,many groups around the world have made exciting progress inbiotechnology, molecular biology, genetic engineering and relatedareas. The outcome is a recent new wave of research and developmentin articial cells. Many groups around the world are now workingon extensions and modications of articial cells for use innanotechnology, nanobiotechnology, blood substitutes, regenerativemedicine, gene therapy, cell/stem cell therapy and other areas (Oriveet al., 2003; Chang, 2005). Later chapters will describe some of these in more detail. This is now such a broad area that space will only allowfor review of these areas with detailed examples based on research inmy laboratory. Research in the many other centers will be presentedby other authors in subsequent publications under the book series on\"Regenerative Medicine, Articial Cells and Nanomedicine.\" 1.5.

Basic Features of Articial Cells The initial research on articial cells forms the basic principles of articial cells, principles that have been extended for use in manyareas by many groups. Indeed, as stated in the rst monograph entitled Articial Cells (Chang, 1972a): \"Articial cell is not a specic physical entity. It is an idea involving the preparation of articial structuresof cellular dimensions for possible replacement or supplement ofdecient cell functions. It is clear that different approaches can beused to demonstrate this idea.\" Basic features of early articial cells Earlier articial cells have some of the simpler properties of biologicalcells (Fig. 2.1). Some examples of the basic features are: (1) The membrane of an articial cell separates its content from the outside. At the same time, the membrane can be prepared suchthat it can selectively allow different types of molecules to cross it. This ranges from membrane that does not allow any molecules to cross it to those that allow even very large molecules like proteinsto cross it. In between these two extremes, there are articial cell 12April 2, 2007 Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... ch02 FA Basic Principles 13 Fig. 2.1. Upper : Basic principles of early articial cells. Middle : Different types of early articial cells based on these basic principles. Lower : Present status of articial cells with wide variations in contents, membrane materialand dimensions.April 2, 2007 14 Articial Cells membranes that restrict the movement of molecules according to molecular size, lipid solubility, afnity to carrier mechanisms, etc. (2) Articial cell membranes can be very thin, yet strong and have a large surface area. Thus, 10 ml of 20 \u00b5mdiameter articial cells has a total surface area of 2500 cm2. This is the same as the total membrane surface area of an articial kidney machine. In addition,an articial cell membrane is 100 times thinner than that of anarticial kidney membrane. This means that smaller molecules canmove across 10 ml of 20 \u00b5mdiameter articial cells 100 times faster than that across an articial kidney machine (Chang, 1966). The microscopic size of articial cells also allows material to diffuse rapidly inside the articial cells. (3) Articial cells can contain the same biological material as biological cells. In addition, they are more versatile sinceadsorbents, magnetic materials, cells, drugs and other material canalso be included separately or in combination (Fig. 2.1). Present status of the basic features of articial cells of macro, micron, nano and molecular dimensions The general principles of articial cells can form the basis of a large number of articial systems (Fig. 2.1). In addition to being of cellulardimensions in the micron range, they can also be in the macrorange, nano range or molecular range. Furthermore, the membranematerial includes polymer, biodegradable polymer, lipid, crosslinkedprotein, lipid-polymer complex, lipid-protein complex and membranewith transport carriers. Articial cells can contain an unlimitedvariety of material individually or in combinations (Fig. 2.1). Theseinclude cells, stem cells, enzymes, multienzyme systems, hemoglobin,magnetic materials, microorganisms, vaccines, genes for gene therapy,genetically engineered cells, adsorbents, drugs, hormones, peptides,proteins and others. The following is a brief overview of some of examples that illustrate the basic principles. Later chapters contain detailed references anddescriptions.April 2, 2007 12:8 SPI-B446 Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Basic Principles 15 2.2. Nanotechnology and Nanobiotechnology There is much recent interest in nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is a large and complex area that embraces many diverse approaches.One of these is to make the original articial cells smaller usingthe same basic principles and method. This includes biodegradablenanoparticles, nanospheres and nanocapsules. Examples include nanoarticial red blood cells with lipid membrane (Djordjevich and Miller,1980) or biodegradable polymeric membranes nano articial redblood cells (WP Yu and Chang, 1994) (Fig. 1.1). A later section willsummarize other examples used in drug delivery systems. Nanobiotechnology and articial cells Nanobiotechnology is the assembling of biological intonanodimension structures, membranes with nanodimension thicknessor nanotubules with nanodimension diameter. The rst nanobiotechnology approach crosslinking of hemoglobin into ultrathin polyhemoglobin (PolyHb) membranewith nanodimension thickness (Chang, 1964, 1965) (Fig. 2.2). This is used to form the membrane of articial red blood cells (Chang, 1964, 1965). If the emulsion is made very small, then thewhole submicron articial be hemoglobin PolyHb, consisting of an assembly of4-5 hemoglobin molecules (Chang, 1971b) (Fig. 2.2). Two groups have independently developed this 1971 basic method of glutaraldehyde crosslinking for clinical use. One is glutaraldehydehuman PolyHb (PolyHb) (Gould et al., 1998; Gould et al., 2002). Their phase III clinical trial shows that this PolyHb can replace blood lostin trauma surgery by keeping the blood hemoglobin at an acceptablelevel.The second PolyHb is glutaraldehyde-crosslinked bovine PolyHbwhich has been tested in Phase III clinical trials (Pearce and Gawryl,1998; Sprung et al. , 2002). South Africa has approved this PolyHb for routine clinical use in patients. Unlike red blood cells, there isno blood group, and thus PolyHb can be given on the spot, withoutApril 2, 2007 SPI-B446 Articial Articial Cells Fig. 2.2. Nano articial can be prepared in nanodimensions as membrane-enclosed nano articial cells or by the use of nanobiotechnologyto assemble biological molecules together into nanodimension structures.Upper : An example of assembling of biological molecules to form polyHb and conjugated Hb.

They are also free from infective agents such as HIV, hepatitis C, bacteria, parasites andso on. Furthermore, whereas donor blood has to be stored at 4 C and is only good for 42 days, PolyHb can be stored at room temperature formore than a year. Thus, PolyHb can have important uses in a numberof clinical conditions notably for surgery. Nanobiotechnology and the assembling of hemoglobin with enzymes that remove oxygen radicals As PolyHbs can be kept at room temperature and used immediately on the spot, they can have potential for use in treating severebleeding (hemorrhagic shock). However, the process must be carriedout fast because if delay occurs, the PolyHb alone might resultin the production of oxygen radicals that cause tissue injury(ischemia-reperfusion injuries). Antioxidant enzymes normally presentin red blood cells are not enough to prevent this problem. Weuse glutaraldehyde crosslinking to assemble a nanobiotechnologycomplex of PolyHb-SOD-CAT by crosslinking hemoglobin, superoxidedismutase and catalase (D'Agnillo and Chang, 1998) (Fig. 2.2). In thisway, one can increase the antioxidant enzymes to a much higher levelthan those in red blood cells. Obstruction of arteries due to clots or other causes can result in stroke or heart attack (myocardial infarction). Being a solution, PolyHb canmore easily perfuse partially obstructed vessels. However, if there is aprolonged lack of oxygen, reperfusion with PolyHb alone may give riseto damaging oxygen radicals, resulting in ischemia-reperfusion injuries. Thus, in a rat stroke model, after 60 min of ischemia, reperfusion with PolyHb resulted in a signicant increase in the breakdown ofthe blood-brain barrier and an increase in brain water (brain edema)(Powanda and Chang, 2002). On the other hand, polyHb-SOD-CAT didnot result in these adverse changes (Powanda and Chang, 2002). Nanobiotechnology for the assembling of hemoglobin with other enzymes Abnormal microcirculation in tumor leads to a decrease in perfusion by oxygen carrying red blood cells (Pearce and Gawryl, 1998). PolyHbApril 2, 2007 Articial Cells can more easily perfuse the abnormal microcirculation of tumors to supply oxygen needed for chemotherapy or radiation therapy. With acirculation half-time of 24 h, the effect can be adjusted to the durationof the chemotherapy or radiation therapy. When used together withchemotherapy, PolyHb decreases the growth of tumor and increases thelifespan in a rat model of gliosarcoma brain tumor (Pearce and Gawryl,1998). We have recently crosslinked tyrosinase with hemoglobin toform a soluble PolyHb-tyrosinase complex (BL Yu and Chang, 2004)(Fig. 2.2).This has the dual function of supplying the needed oxygen andat the same time lowering the systemic levels of tyrosine needed for thegrowth of melanoma. Intravenous injections delayed the growth ofthe melanoma without causing adverse effects in the treated animals(BL Yu and Chang, 2004). Conjugation of polymer with proteins In the presence of diamine, sebacyl chloride crosslinks hemoglobinwith polyamide to form conjugated hemoglobin (Chang, 1964,1965)(Fig. 2.2). This can be in the form of nanothickness articial cellmembranes or conjugated Hb of single enzyme or single hemoglobin molecule tosoluble polymers (Tam et al. , 1976; Duncan, 2003; Li, Zhang & Liu, 2005; Winslow, 2006) (Fig. 2.2). Promising Phase II clinical trials areongoing (Winslow, 2006). This extension is not nanobiotechnologysince conjugation of single biological molecule is not the same process asassembling of biological molecules. 2.3. Cell Homogenate, Organelle, Enzymes and Multienzyme Systems Cell homogenate As discussed in Chapter 1, articial cells were rst prepared by replacing the membrane of biological cells with articial membranes(Chang, 1957). For example, an articial membrane replaces the redblood cell membrane, but the content is the same as that in theoriginal red blood cells. The same principle can also be applied toother types of biological cells. For example, we have prepared articialApril 2, 2007 12:8 SPI-B446 Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Principles 19 cells containing hepatocyte microsomes and cytosol (Yuan and Chang, 1986). Enzymes and enzyme therapy A large array of enzyme systems is present in the cell homogenates. Simpler articial cells can be made to contain only one enzyme(Chang, 1964, 1972) (Fig. 2.3). The enclosed enzyme would not leak Fig. 2.3. Upper left : Problems related to injection of enzymes in free solution. Upper right : Enzymes inside articial cells no longer have these problems. Lower left : Articial cells can be prepared with multistep enzyme systems with recyling of cofactors.

This would avoid protein sensitization, anaphylactic reaction, or antibody productionwith repeated injections (Fig. 2.3). Implanted urease articial cellsconvert systemic urea into ammonia (Chang, 1964, 1965). Implantingarticial cells containing catalase can replace the defective enzyme inmice with a congenital catalase defect \u2014 acatalasemia (Chang andPoznanski, 1968). The articial cells protect the enclosed enzymefrom immunological reactions (Poznanski and Chang, 1974). Articialcells containing asparaginase implanted into mice delay the onset andgrowth of lymphosarcoma (Chang, 1971). Giving enzyme articial cells by mouth obviates the need for repeated injections. For example, articial cells containing urease andammonia adsorbent can lower the systemic urea level (Chang, 1972a).In Lesch-Nyhan disease, enzyme defect resulted in the elavationof hypoxanthine toxic levels. Given by mouth, articial cellscontaining xanthine oxidase lowers the toxic systemic hypoxanthinelevels in an infant with this disease (Chang, 1989; Palmour et al. , 1989). Phenylketonuria is a more congenital enzyme defect. Articial cells containing phenylalanine ammonia lyase, given by mouth, lower the systemic phenylalanine levels in phenylketonuria[PKU] in rats (Bourget and Chang, 1986). This leads to investigationinto recombinant sources of this enzyme (Sarkissian et al. , 1999; Liu et al. , 2002). Multienzyme systems with cofactor recycling Most enzymes in the body function as multienzyme systems with cofactor recycling. After basic research on articial cells containingmultienzyme systems (Chang, 1985a), we looked into their possibleuse. Thus, articial cells containing three different enzymes canconvert metabolic wastes like urea and ammonia into essential aminoacids (Gu and Chang, 1988) (Fig.2.3). The needed cofactor, NADH,can be recycled and retained inside the articial cells by crosslinkingto dextran or by using a lipid-polymer membrane. All the multienzymesystems in red blood cells can be included inside nanodimensionarticial red blood cells (Chang et al. , 2003) (Fig. 2.3).April 2, 2007 Nanotechnology, Regenerative... Basic Principles 21 2.4. Articial Cells Containing Intracelluar Compartments Biological cells contain intracellular organelles. This allows separate compartments inside the cells to carry out specic functions moreeffectively. We have prepared articial cells that also containintracellular compartments (Chang 1965, 1972a; Chang et al. , 1966) Fig. 2.4. Upper : Articial cells can be prepared with intracellular multi- compartments. Lower : Articial cells containing biologics can also contain magnetic material allowing articial cells to be site directed. Both principlesare being extended by many groups and are being used in different areas ofapplication and research.April 2, 2007 Cells (Fig. 2.4). Specic enzyme systems or other biologically active systems can be enclosed separately or in combination in each of theseintracellular compartments to allow for more efcient stepwisefunctions. 2.5. Articial Cells Containing Biologics and Magnetic Material When magnetic material is included in articial cells containing biological materials, one can use an external magnetic eld to direct the articial cells (Chang, 1966) (Fig. 2.4). This principle is now beingused very extensively in bioreactors, in removing specic materialsfrom a mixture as in diagnositcs kits, drug delivery systems and otherareas of application. 2.6. Cells, Islets, Stem Cells, Genetically-engineered Cells and Microorganisms Articial cells containing cells The rst articial cells containing intact biological cells were reported in 1964 based on a drop method (Chang, 1964), and it was proposedthat \" protected from immunological process, encapsulated endocrine cells might survive and maintain an effective supply of hormone \" (1965, Chang et al. , 1966) (Fig. 2.5). Chang asked Conaught Laboratory of insulin fame to develop this for use in islet transplantation for diabetes. Later, Sun and hiscollaborator from Conaught Laboratory developed Chang's originaldrop method (Chang, 1964,1965,1972a; Chang et al. , 1966), using alginate-polylysine-alginate (APA) for the articial cell membranes(Lim and Sun, 1980). They showed that after implantation, the insulinsecreting islets inside the articial cells indeed remained viable andcontinued to secrete insulin to control the glucose levels of diabeticrats (Lim and Sun, 1980). We have been studying the use of articial cells containing liver cells (hepatocytes) for liver support. Implanting these increases theApril 2, 2007 SPI-B446 Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... ch02 FA Basic Principles 23 Fig. 2.5.

Priniciple has been extended and used by many groups for bioencapsulation of islets,cells, genetically-engineered cells and stem cells (Chang, Nature Rev. Drug Discovery , 2005).April 2, 2007 Regenerative... ch02 FA 24 Articial Cells survival of acute liver failure rats (Wong and Chang 1986); lowers the high bilirubin level in congenital Gunn rats (Bruni and Chang,1989); and prevents xenograft rejection (Wong and Chang, 1988). We developed a two-step cell encapsulation method to improve the APA method, resulting in improved survival of implanted cells(Wong and Chang, 1991a). Cell bioencapsulation for cell therapy hasbeen extensively developed by many other groups especially usingarticial cells containing endocrine tissues, hepatocytes, genetically-engineered cells and stem cells (Orive et al., 2002; Chang, 2005). This is a very broad area that will be described in much more detail in thelater chapters. Below is a brief introduction to the use of this principlefor stem cells and genetically-engineered cells. Stem cells We used the two-step method and the coencapsulation of stem cells and hepatocytes into articial cells (Liu and Chang, 2000)(Fig. 2.5).This results in further increase in the viability of encapsulatedhepatocytes both in culture and after implantation (Liu and Chang,2002). An implantation of articial cells containing both hepatocytes-stem cells into Gunn rats lowers the systemic bilirubin levels, the lowlevel being maintained for two months (Liu and Chang, 2003). Withoutstem cells, the implanted hepatocytes in articial cells can only bemaintained at the low level for one month. What is even more excitingis our recent nding using articial cells containing only bone marrowstem cells and no hepatocytes. The control group of rats with 90% oftheir liver surgically removed did not survive. Unlike free stem cells,an intraperitoneal injection of articial cells containing bone marrowstem cells alone results in long-term survival (Liu and Chang, 2006). Along with this, the livers regenerate and return to their normal weights. Genetically-engineered cells Many groups have carried out extensive research on articial cellscontaining genetically-engineered cells. This more recent and veryimportant area will be discussed in detail in a later chapter, includingApril 2, 2007 12:8 SPI-B446 Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... ch02 FA Basic Principles 25 potential applications in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, dwarsm, pain otherareas (Basic et 1996;Tan et al., 1996; 2002; Cirone et al. , 2002). To avoid the need for implantation, we studied the oral use of articialcells containing genetically-engineered nonpathogenic E. coli DH5 cells to lower systemic urea in renal failure rats (Prakash and Chang,1996; Chang, 1997). 2.7. Articial Cells Containing Bioadsorbents As mentioned earlier, the microscopic dimensions of articial cells result in a large surface-to-volume relationship. This, together with theultrathin membranes, allow articial cells containing bioadsorbents tobe much more effective when compared to standard hemodialysis inremoving toxins and drugs from the blood of patients (Chang, 1966,1969a, 1975g). The most common routine application of this approach is the use of microscopic polymeric articial cells encapsulating activatedcharcoal (Chang, 1969, 1973a,b, 1975g) (Fig. 2.6). Its use solves themajor problems of release of embolizing particles and damage toblood cells when bioadsorbents are used without the articial cellmembranes (Fig. 8). The rst successful application was in suicidaloverdose patients (Chang et al., 1973a,b). Since then, this has become a routine treatment worldwide for acute poisoning in adults andchildren, especially in cases of suicidal overdose (Chang, 1975b,1975c; Winchester, 1988; Singh et al. , 2004; Lin et al. , 2004; Peng et al., 2004; Lopez et al., 2002; Kawasahi et al., 2000; Lin et al., 2002; Tominaga, 1997). The treatment is particularly useful in places where dialysis machines are not readily available. The approach is also effective in removing toxic products in kidney failure patients (uremia), resulting in the relief of uremic symptoms(Chang et al. , 1971a; Regenerative... ch02 FA 26 Articial Cells Fig. 2.6. Upper : Problems related to adsorbents when used to remove toxin from blood. Middle : Adsorbents inside articial cells no longer have these problems and therefore can be used in hemoperfusion to remove toxins fromblood. Lower : Adsorbent inside articial cells. Since its rst clinical use as articial cells containing activated charcoal in hemoperfusion in patients, itis now a routine method for the treatment of acute poisoning.April 2, 2007 12:8 SPI-B446 Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... ch02 FA Basic Principles 27 for the removal of other uremic wastes need to be developed. The approach has also proved to be effective in removing toxic moleculesin patients with severe liver failure, resulting in the recovery ofconsciousness of grade 4 hepatic coma patients (Chang, 1972b, 1975g;Gazzard et al., 1974). Detoxication is only one of the functions of the liver, and this approach is being used as the detoxication componentof hybrid liver support systems that are being developed (Liu et al. , 2001). The success in the clinical uses of articial cells containing bioadsorbents for detoxication has led to an increasing interest inresearch and development in many other areas. One of these is inarticial cells containing immuoadsorbents (Chang, 1980d). 2.8. Research on Membrane Model Systems Since the membrane compositions of articial cells can be variedat will, they can serve as membrane model systems. Indeed, workin this laboratory shows that it is possible to vary the membraneproperties as to porosity, thickness, charge, lipid content, proteincontent, mucopolysaccharide content, and polymer composition(Chang, 1964, 1965, 1972a). We have used articial cells to studythe biophysics of membrane transport (Chang and Poznansky, 1968c);the relationship of surface properties to survival in circulation(Chang, 1965, 1972a; Chang et al. , 1967b); and the relationship of physicochemical properties to the effect on coagulation and formedelements of blood (Chang et al., 1967b; Chang, 1969a). Other workers have made use of these articial cells in the study of the mechanicaland electrical properties of membranes (Jay and Edwards, 1968; Jayand Burton, 1969; Jay and Sivertz, 1969). Bangham and his co-workers prepared liposomes that are liquid crystal microspheres, each consisting of concentric shellsof bimolecular lipid layers as a model system (Bangham et al. , 1965). Mueller and Rudin (1968) adopted the Chang procedurefor the preparation of articial cells (Chang, 1964) to preparearticial cells having only a single bilayer lipid membrane. Sincebiological cell membranes consist of both 28 Articial Cells have prepared articial cells with membrane of lipid-polymer or lipid-protein for membrane transport studies (Chang, 1969d). Thisalso includes the incorporation of macrocyclic molecules into themembrane as a carrier transport mechanism (Chang, 1969d). Anotherapproach is to incorporate Na +-K+-ATPase into the lipid-polymer articial cell membrane (Rosenthal & Chang, 1980). Since then,there have been very extensive studies on the inclusion of manydifferent types of transport system or targeting agents or other materialsinto different types of articial cell membranes (Torchilin, 2005;Chang, 2005). 2.9. Cell Physiology In cell physiology, there is much research on the origin of cellularresponses. One important area is the location of the triggeringmechanisms and whether they are located at the cell surface, inintracellular organelles, or in the soluble constituents of the cytoplasm.It has been suggested (Chang, 1972a) that the enclosure of cell contentsin articial cells might be one way of studying this. It would beinteresting to test the sites of action of certain hormones; changesin extracellular electrolytes; and substances causing the release ofcertain intracellular material. This would throw light on whether thesubstance acts on specic surface receptors, or only indirectly affectsthe intracellular material, or whether it directly affects the intracellularmaterial. 2.10. Drug Delivery Polymeric semipermeable microcapsules Luzzi (1970a) used membrane articial cells as reported earlier(Chang, 1964) to microencapsulate drugs for slow release. Others havealso extended this approach. However, the modern approaches in drugdelivery systems are based on nanotechnology.This is to prepare muchsmaller cells Nanotechnology, Blood Regenerative... Principles 29 Biodegradable polymeric articial cells, nanoparticles, nanocapsules Biodegradable membrane articial cells have been prepared to contain enzymes, hormones, vaccines, and other biologicals (Chang, 1976a). The polylactide polymer can degrade in the body into lactic acid and nally into water and carbon dioxide. In the same study, variationsin preparation can result in articial cells that release insulin atdifferent rates (Chang, 1976a). Biodegradable drug delivery systemsare now used widely in different forms, ranging from microscopicto nanodimensions (LaVan et al. , 2002). They as nanoparticles, nanocapsules, polymersomes, nanotubules, etc. Liposomes \u2014 lipid membrane articial Bangham rst reported the preparation of liposome consisting ofmicrospheres of hundreds of concentric lipid bilayers \u2014 multi-lamellar(Bangham et al. , 1965). They used these as a membrane model for basic membrane research. When Gregoriadis completed his Ph.D. inbiochemistry at McGill, he came to see me to discuss his future areasof research. I encouraged him to look into different ways of formingarticial cells for delivery of biologics. His subsequent research inEngland on the use of liposomes as drug delivery systems opened awhole new approach (Gregoriadis, 1976). The large amount of lipid in the original multilamellar liposomes (Bangham et al. , 1965) limits the amount of drugs or biologics that can be enclosed. Thus, the basic principles and methods of articialcells (Chang, 1957, 1964) were extended by researchers into an\"ether evaporation method\" to form single and Bangham, 1976). Much since then have resulted in liposomes being usedextensively as pharmaceutical drug carriers (Torchilin, 2005). Themodern bilayer lipid vesicles are actually single bilayer lipidmembrane articial cells. However, even now, there is still reluctancein using the term \"articial cells\" and the Regenerative... ch02 FA 30 Articial Cells be used. However, some researchers and research groups are starting to call these \"articial cells.\" 2.11. Other Systems As suggested earlier (Chang 1974, 1965, 1972a), the general principles of articial cells could be explored as follows.Articial cells containingradioactive isotopes or antimetabolites might be used for intraarterialinjection into tumors. In this case, some of the microcapsules mightlodge at the tumor site, while others would be carried by lymphaticchannels to act on tumor cells that have metastasized to the regionallymph nodes. Articial cells containing radiopaque material wouldprovide a contrast medium. Provided they can circulate readily in thebloodstream, they might be used as vehicles for contrast materials inangiography. Articial cells containing highly magnetic alloys mightprovide a useful preparation for the measurement of blood flowin unopened vessels by electromagnetic techniques. If membranesof crosslinked protein can be made to retain the immunologicalcharacteristics of the protein, there might be a place for these inserological studies or target drug delivery.April 3, 2007 Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... ch03 FA CHAPTER 3 Oxygen Carriers Based on Nanobiotechnology 3.1. Introduction As discussed in the last chapter, nanobiotechnology is the assembling of biological molecules into one of the following categories: nano-dimension structures, membranes with nanodimension thickness,and nanotubules with nanodimension diameter. The rst nanobio-technology approach reported in the literature is the crosslinkingof Hb into ultrathin polyhemoglobin (PolyHb) membrane withnanodimension thickness for cell membrane (Chang, 1964,1965) (Fig. 2.2). If the emulsions are made very small, then thewhole submicron articial 1971b) (Fig. 2.2). This principle was laterdeveloped independently by two groups to produce oxygen carriersfor the replacement of the oxygen carrying function of red blood cellsin the nal phases of clinical trials (Moss et al. , 1988; Gould et al. , 2002; Pearce & Gawryl, 1998; Pearce et al., 2006; Sprung et al., 2002). Oxygen carriers developed by one group are in routine clinical usein South Africa (Lok, 2001). There are also other types of Hb-basedoxygen carriers that are not based on nanobiotechnology. This chapterdiscusses why nanobiotechnology has been used and how Hb-basedoxygen carriers prepared using this approach compare with other typesof Hb-based oxygen carriers. 31April 3, Regenerative... ch03 FA 32 Articial Cells 3.2. Hemoglobin as Oxygen Carrier As shown in Fig. 1.1, red blood cell membranes contain blood group antigens, and typing and matching are needed before red blood cellscan be transfused into patients. This results in delays in emergencysituations. With the standard method, red blood cells can be storedfor only about 42 days. Red blood cells cannot be sterilized to removeinfective agents like hepatitis viruses, HIV and other potential emerginginfective agents. Thus, red blood cell substitutes are being developed(Fig. 1.1). Red blood cell (rbc) contains Hb, antioxidant enzymes and amultienzyme system to prevent the conversion of Hb to nonfunctioningmetHb. As such, preparing a clinically useful complete articial redblood cell has been a very complicated process and will be discussedin the next two chapters. In the meantime, nanobiotechnology hasallowed the development of simpler oxygen carriers containing onlyHb. Although the simpler oxygen carriers are not as complete as thearticial red blood cell, some of them have more immediate possibilityof clinical use. Why do we need to modify Hb? Hb is a tetramer with two subunits and two subunits ( 1122) (Perutz, 1989). Although an excellent oxygen carrier, Hb extracted from the blood cells cannot be usedfor infusion because it is highly toxic to the kidney (Rabiner et al. , 1967). Even highly puried stroma-free Hb (SFHb), in which the rbcmembrane stroma is removed, still showed toxicity to the kidney inhumans (Savitsky et al. , 1978). It is now known that when free Hb is infused into the body, the tetramer ( 1122) breaks down into toxic dimers ( 11 and 22) that cause renal toxicity and other adverse effects. The challenge is how to make use of the excellent oxygencarrying properties of Hb but at the same time eliminate its toxic effects.Figure 3.1 summarizes the four general methods of Hb modication. 3.3. Modied Hb Four types of modied Hb have been developed and tested in clinicaltrials. PolyHb based on nanobiotechnology, Regenerative... ch03 FA Oxygen Carriers Based on Nanobiotechnology 33 Fig. 3.1. First generation oxygen therapeutics PolyHb is based on nanobiotechnology. PolyHb based on nanobiotechnology (Fig. 3.1) In 1964, Chang rst used bifunctional agents to crosslink the reactive amino groups of Hb to assemble Hb together PolyHbApril 3, rst glutaraldehyde, was used to crosslink hemoglobin (10 gm/dl) and trace amounts of catalase (Chang,1971). crosslinking is adjusted so that the crosslinked PolyHb is in a soluble state. This results in lesssteric hindrance and greater ease of substrate diffusion. This methodcrosslinks the protein molecules to one another (intermolecular). It canalso crosslink each protein molecule internally (intramolecular). Later,two groups independently applied the glutaraldehyde crosslinkedPolyHb principle to develop oxygen carriers that are in ongoing phaseIII clinical trials (Moss et al. , 1988; Gould et al. , 2002; Pearce and Gawryl, Pearce et al. , 2006; Sprung et al. , 2002). One of these has been approved for routine use in South Africa (Lok, 2001). Conjugated Hb (Fig. 3.1) In 1964, Chang showed that in the presence of both diamine andHb, (Chang, 1964, 1965) (Fig. 2.2). This methodhas been extended to produce (intramolecular) soluble conjugatedHb (Fig. 3.1) formed by the linking of one Hb molecule to solublepolymers, as prepared by Sunder in 1975; Wong in 1976; Iwashitain 1980; and the Enzon group in 1988. More recently, Winslow'sgroup used an improved maleimide-polyethylene glycol conjugatedHb that with its water of hydration would not result in vasopressoreffect (Winslow, 2006). This is now in an ongoing phase II clinicaltrial. Liu's group (Li et al. , 2005) has developed another type of PEG- conjugated Hb that is also in an ongoing 3, 2007 16:34 SPI-B446 Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, on 35 single tetrameric Hb (Fig. 3.1) Bunn and Jandl 1968 reported use of crosslinker, bis(N-maleimidomethyl)ether, to crosslink Hb molecules internally(intramolecular). Walder et in 1979 reported of DPG pocket the Hb molecule. This approach prevents dimers formation and improves P 50, and has been extensively developed and tested in clinical trials. However, this didnot progress further because of vasopressor effects and cardiac lesionsin experimental animals (Nelson, 1998; Burhop and Estep; 2001). Recombinant human Hb (Fig. 3.1) Another very exciting area is the use of recombinant technology to produce recombinant human Hb from E. coli (Hoffman et al. , 1990). Recombinant human Hb is formed by the fusion of the two subunits of each Hb molecule to prevent its breakdown into two half molecules(dimers). It also has a good P 50. This recombinant human Hb has been developed and tested in clinical trials (Freytag and Templeton, 1997). Vasopressor effects are observed in clinical trials. A new recombinant human Hb has been prepared that does not bind nitric oxide, thuseliminating the problem of vasopressor effect (Doherty et al. , 1998). The new recombinant human Hb is also a potential source of Hb for PolyHb and conjugated Hb and other future generation Hb-basedblood substitutes. Present status As seen from Fig 3.1, most of the basic principles of modied Hb have been made available by the 1960s. Unfortunately, there was nopublic interest in these approaches then. The major efforts at that timewere concentrated on the production of puried native Hb (SFHb)and perfluorochemicals. Savitsky et al. 's study in humans in 1978, showed that SFHb was unsuitable for use in humans. Shortly after this,it was found that perfluorocarbons available at that time had someadverse effects in humans and they did not carry enough oxygen inApril 3, 2007 16:34 SPI-B446 Articial Regenerative...

Thus, a few investigators started to turn to the earlier approach to approach modied Hb. This effort wassuddenly intensied after 1986, when HIV in donor blood became amajor public concern. As a result, extensive studies have been carriedout by many groups on modied Hb (Table 3.1). The very extensivepublications by these researchers can be found in the reference sectionof this book. This has led to clinical trials in all four types of modiedHb. Of these, nanobiotechnology-based PolyHb and conjugated Hbcontinue to show promise in clinical trials. 3.4. PolyHb in Clinical Trials Gould et al. (2002) reported their phase III clinical trials on 171 patients using their glutaraldehyde crosslinked human polyHb with<1% unpolymerized Hb. They showed that this can successfully compensate for extensive blood loss in trauma surgery by maintainingthe Hb level at 8 to 10 g/dl needed for safe surgery with no reportedside effects. For example, transfusion of this PolyHb in patients withan Hb level as low as 2 g/dl, can raise the Hb level to within the 8 toApril 3, 2007 Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Regenerative... Oxygen Carriers Based on Nanobiotechnology 37 10 g/dl level, with the patients recovering from surgery. Their historical analysis showed that without transfusion, most patients with Hb levelsof 3g/dl did not survive.This group has infused up to 10 liters of PolyHbinto individual trauma surgery patients. They have carried out furtherclinical trials on its use in pre-hospital emergencies.These clinical trialshave been completed and information on these trials and the protocolcan be found on their website (www.northeldlabs.com). In the USA,this product has been approved for compassionate use in patients andit is awaiting regulatory decision for routine clinical use. Given that the supply of Hb from outdated donor blood is limited, a glutaraldehyde-crosslinked bovine polyHb with <4% unpolymerized molecular Hb, has been developed and tested in phase III clinicaltrials (Pearce and Gawryl, 1998; Pearce et al. , 2006; Sprung et al. , 2002). For example, they have carried out multicenter, multinational,randomized, single-blind, rbc-controlled phase III clinical trials inpatients surgery. A total of 688 patientsare randomized 1:1 to receive either the polyHb or rbc at thetime of the rst perioperative rbc transfusion decision and 59.4%of the patients receiving polyHb required no rbc transfusion all theway to follow-up; 96.3% avoided transfusion with rbc on the rstpostoperative day and up to 70.3% avoided rbc transfusion up to day7. This bovine polyHb has been approved for routine clinical use inpatients in South Africa, a region with a higher incidence of humanimmunodeciency virus (Lok, 2001). In North America, the PolyHbhas been approved for compassionate use in patients. More detailscan be found on www.biopure.com. Another way to solve the problem of the supply of Hb is the recent use of red blood cells from placentas that are discarded after birth as asource of human Hb for preparing glutaraldehyde human polyHb (Liet al. , 2006). Recombinant human Hb is another potential source of Hb to form polyHb (Doherty et al., 1998; Olsen et al., 2004; Fronticelli et al. , 2004). Compared with donor red blood cells, nanobiotechnology-based polyHb is not a complete red blood cell substitute. It is only an oxygencarrier. Furthermore, its circulation half-time of about one day is muchlower than that of donor rbc. On the other hand, polyHb has a numberof advantages (Table 3.4).April 3, Regenerative... ch03 38 Articial Cells Table 3.2 Comparing Four T ypes of Modied Hb T ype Method of PreparationNotes PolyHb based on the do not cross theintercellular junction of the endothelial cell lining of blood vessels to remove nitric oxide; as aresult, they do not have adversevasopressor effects. Two types of PolyHb are in the nal stages of phase III clinical trials and one ofthese is approved for human use in South Africa. Conjugated Hb PEG molecules are linked to each Hb molecule. The PEGand the water of hydration both contribute to a largerdiameter PEG-Hbmolecule.If each of the PEG-Hb molecules with its added water of hydration approaches the required dimension,then there is no vasopressor effect as long as there are no free single Hb molecules. PEG-Hb is being testedin ongoing phase II clinical trials.

Vasopressor effects Not all modied Hb (Fig. 3.1 and Table 3.2) have been successful in clinical trials as vasopressor effects have been observed in someof the rst generation modied Hb blood Hb Hb (Freytag Templeton,1997) blood substitutes contain 100% of molecular dimensionmodied Hb. Infusion of small volumes cause vasopressor effectsand also increased smooth muscle contractions. With another typeof polyHb that contains 36% molecular dimension modied Hb,signicant vasoactivity and increased smooth muscle contractionscould also be observed when larger doses are used. On the other hand,Gould et al. (2002) have not reported any vasopressor effects in their clinical trial using polyHb with <1% molecular dimension modied Hb even when large volumes of 10 liters are infused. Theories why vasopressor effects are observed only in some types of modied Hb? The hypothesis for the observed vasopressor effects is that the intercellular junctions of the endothelial lining of the vascular wallallow molecular dimension Hb to enter into the interstitial space(Chang, 1997; Gould et al., 1998) (Fig. 3.1). There, Hb acts as a sink in binding and removing nitric oxide needed for maintaining the normaltone of smooth muscles.This results in constriction of the blood vesselsand other smooth muscles, especially those of the esophagus and GItract. Opponents to the hypothesis argue that one cannot compare thedifferent types of modied Hb since there are major differences in thechemistry involved and in the oxygen afnity.April 3, 2007 Articial Cells Effects of tetrameric Hb on vasoactivity and ECG (Fig. 3.2) We therefore prepare nanodimension PolyHb each containing different percentages of molecular dimension Hb using the sameglutaraldehyde crosslinking method and characterized the Hbto ensure that they all have the same oxygen afnity (BLYu, Fig. 3.2. Changes in electrocardiogram (ECG) after injection of 1/6 toploading with PolyHb containing 16%, 38% and 78% of tetramers,respectively at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. Pre-IV: before intravenous injection;Post-IV: after intravenous injection. Preliminary study shows that similartoploading using PolyHb with 0.4% tetramers did not result in any changes.(BLYu, & 2006.)April 3, 2007 Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Regenerative... ch03 FA Oxygen Carriers Based on Nanobiotechnology 41 Liu and Chang, 2006). The result shows that the one with 0.4% molecular dimension modied Hb does not cause vasoconstrictionnor changes in the electrocardiogram (e.g. 16%, 38% and 78%). Withan increasing percentage of molecular dimensions modied Hb, thereis an increasing degree of vasoconstriction and elevation of the STsegment of the electrocardiogram (Fig 3.2). ST elevation could be dueto vasoconstriction resulting in decreased supply of oxygen to the heartand this may explain the observation of small subendocardial lesionsin some primates and swine after infusion with one type of moleculardimension modied Hb (Burhop and Estap, 2001). Based PolyHb with 0.4%, 16%, 38% and 78% of tetramers, respectively, we carried out the followinganalysis. First, we calculate the total amount of tetrameric Hb (g/kgbody weight) that is 16%, 38% and78% of tetramers, respectively. Next, calculate the total amountof tetramers needed to cause vasopressor effects or ECG changes. Wethen calculate the total amount 1/3, 1/2and 3/3 blood volume replacement (Table 3.3). We plot this (Fig. 3.3). The top dashed line represents severe changes in ECG. The middle line is the level where the blood pressure increases markedly and this isalso the highest concentration that does not cause marked changes inECG, except for a slight elevation of the ST segment. The bottom solidline shows the level that did not cause an increase in arterial bloodpressure (BLYu, Liu & Chang, 2006).

The bottom solid lineshows the level that did not cause an increase in arterial blood pressure.(BLYu, Liu & Chang, 2006.) tetrameric Hb, even replacing the total body blood volume, would not cause any vasopressor effects or changes in the ECG (Fig. 3.4). Further support of the role of nitric oxide in vasopressor effects has come from Bucci's group who prepared large \"zero-link\" PolyHb(Matheson et al. , 2002). A second generation molecular dimension recombinant Hb that did not bind nitric oxide, also did not causevasoconstriction (Doherty et al., 1998). Since recombinant Hb crosses the intercellular junction and is removed quickly, their circulationtime can be increased by crossliking to form nanodimension polyHb(Fronticelli et al., 2004). Another approach in an ongoing clinical trial is to prepare maleimide-PEG conjugated Hb that with its water ofhydration, would be too large to cross the intercellular junction andthus does not result in Regenerative... ch03 FA Oxygen Carriers Based on Nanobiotechnology 43 Fig. 3.4.

Our analysis described above (BLYu, Liu & Chang, 2006) shows that with 2% tetrameric Hb,there is neither vasoactivity nor change in ECG even with completeblood volume replacement. Therefore, we have designed methodsfor preparing PolyHb with <2% tetrameric Hb (Zolotareva & Chang, 2007). Increasing degree of polymerization would decrease the% of tetrameric Hb. However, this also results in an increase inthe molecular weight of the polyHb that tends to gel at a lowertemperature or other conditions. Thus, instead of increasing thedegree of polymerization, our nal approach is to use preparativechromatography to remove the tetrameric Hb.

Thereis a lack of books written on procedures that readers can readily use intheir laboratory for the preparation and testing of modied Hb. Withthis in view, a section on \"Methods and Procedures\" has been includedat the end of most chapters. 3.7. Nanobiotechnology and Immunogenicity Nanobiotechnology involves the assembling of biological molecules.In the case of polyHb, this is by polymerization of Hb molecules.Even though Hb is only weakly antigenic, it is generally thought thatpolymerization of protein might enhance its immunogenicity. In orderto test this, we analyzed the in vitro and in vivo immunogenicity of crosslinking Hb diaspirin-crosslinked Hb (Estep et al. , 1992). immunology of polymerized Hb (Bleeker et al., 1995). Antigenicity measured as antibody titers The rst basic study is to see whether crosslinking Hb into polyHb increases its antigenicity. Rats are immunized either rat stroma-free Hb or rat polyHb in Freud's adjuvant. To account for cross speciesreactivity, two other groups of rats are immunized with either humanstroma-free Hb or human polyHb. Antigens are labeled with 125I. Figure 3.5 shows that rat Hb in Freud's adjuvant does not increasein the antibody titers when it is repeatedly injected subcutaneouslyinto the rats (homologous). Even in the polymerized form (PolyHb),there is no increase in antibody titers using the very severe testof Freud's adjuvant. On the other hand, Hb from another species(heterologous) is slightly antigenic, resulting in a very small butsignicant increase in antibody titer. Crosslinking Hb from anotherspecies into PolyHb results 40 3.5. Antibody titers in rats after repeated subcutaneous immunization of the solution in Freud's polyHb showed much lower antigenicity when compared with albumin (Fig. 3.5). This low antigenicity agrees with the previous results that show Hb to be weakly antigenic. Furthermore, the effect of crosslinkingof Hb into PolyHb in increasing immunogenicity is only apparentunder heterologous conditions. Thus, the data suggest that within thesame species, crosslinking of Hb into PolyHb does not increase itsantigenicity. On the other hand, repeated subcutaneous injection ofheterologous Hb or PolyHb in Freund's adjuvant resulted in antibodyproduction. Effects of infusion Repeated subcutaneous injection with Freud's adjuvant is a very severetest that does not represent what happens in transfusion. We, therefore,carried out the following study to test the effect of the infusion(Chang and Varma, 1987, 1988; Chang et al. , 1992). First, four groups of rats that had not received any Hb infusion before were used. Each group received one of the following infusionsequivalent to 30% total blood volume: rat Nanotechnology, Regenerative... ch03 FA Oxygen Carriers Based on Nanobiotechnology 47 Fig. 3.6. (Left) Rat or human SFHb or PolyHb infused into rats that have not been immunized. No adverse effects. ( Right ) Rat or human SFHb or PolyHb infused into rats that have been immunized with the respective solutions. Noadverse effects with rat SFHb or rat PolyHb. Adverse effects with heterologoussources, e.g. human SFHb or human PolyHb. (humans). Infusion of any one of the four solutions did not result in any adverse effects (Fig. 3.6). The next study was carried out in immunized rats as follows. The four groups of rats each received subcutaneously immunizing dosesof one of the above four solutions in Freud's adjuvant. After this, theantibody titers were analyzed. The rats in each group then receivedinfusion of the corresponding Hb solution.The volume was 30% of thetotal blood volume. Infusion of rat Hb or rat polyHb into rats that hadreceived immunizing doses in Freud's adjuvant of the respective Hband PolyHb, did not result in any adverse effects (Fig. 3.6). However,infusion of Hb or polyHb from another species into the immunizedrats resulted in severe anaphylactic reactions (Fig. 3.6). The above infusion studies showed that infusion of polyHb from the same species either for the rst time or under the most severeimmunization condition, did not result in any adverse response(Fig. 3.6). Infusion of polyHb from a different species for the rsttime also did not result in any adverse response. However, whenpolyHb from a different species was infused after the most severeApril 3, 2007 16:34 SPI-B446 Articial Regenerative... 48 Articial Cells immunization procedures, there were anaphylactic reactions. Thus, the result seems to show that polyHb from the same species would nothave any immunological problems. It also shows that polyHb froma different species also does not produce any adverse effects wheninfused for the rst time. This nding is supported by another groupin actual clinical trials using large volumes of bovine PolyHb, whichshowed no adverse clinical immunology effects in humans (Pearce andGawryl, 1998; Pearce et al. , 2006). What one cannot conclude from these results is how often can polyHb from another species be infusedbefore there is immunological problem. Estep's group (Estep et 1992), infused crosslinked human Hb into Rheus monkeys. With 5 ml/kg monthly infusion, there was no production of IgG or IgM to the crosslinked Hb). Thus, this type of crosslinking did notresult in any increase in antigenicity.They showed that ve intravenousmonthly infusions of human crosslinked Hb into a different species,Rheus monkey, did not result in any antibody production. This showsthat the very severe test of subcutaneous injection of heterologous Hbwith Freud's adjuvant is more likely to produce an immune responsethan intravenous infusion. 3.8. Bridging the Gap between Safety Studies in Animal and Humans Response in animals is not always the same as for humans. This is especially in tests for hypersensitivity, complement activation andimmunology. How do we bridge the gap between animal safety studiesand use in humans? In vitro screening test using human plasma before use in humans We have devised a simple in vitro test tube screening test (Chang and Lister, 1990, 1992, 1993a, 1993b; Chang et al. , 1993b). This consists of adding 0.1 ml of modied Hb to a test tube containing 0.4 ml ofhuman plasma or blood. The plasma is then analyzed for complementactivation of C3 to C3a after incubation for one hour 3.7). useApril 3, 2007 SPI-B446 Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Regenerative... ch03 FA Oxygen Carriers Based on Nanobiotechnology 49 Fig. 3.7. In vitro screening test for PolyHb: This consists of adding 0.1 ml of PolyHb to a test tube containing 0.4 ml of human plasma or blood.The plasmawas then analyzed for complement activation of C3 to C3a after incubationfor one hour. Closest response to humans next to actual injection into thebody. (Chang & Lister, 1993a.) of human plasma or blood gives the closest response to humans next to an actual injection. If we want to be more specic, we can use theplasma of the same patient who is to receive the blood substitute. Basic principles of screening test Figure 3.8 summarizes the factors that initiate alternate and classicalpathways leading to complement activation of C3 to C3a. Modied Hbmay be contaminated with trace amounts of blood group antigen thatcan form antigen-antibody complex which can activate C3. Othersinclude endotoxins, microorganisms, insoluble immune-complexes,chemicals, polymers, organic solvents and others (Chang, 1997). Inthe preparation or production of blood substitutes, different chemicals,reagents and organic solvents are used. These include crosslinkers,lipids, solvents, chemicals, polymers and other materials. Some ofthese can potentially result in complement activation and otherreactions in humans. Other potential sources of problems includeApril 3, 2007 16:34 SPI-B446 Articial Antigen-Antibody antibodies IgM blood group antibodiesMicroorgansisms Entotoxin Insoluble immune complexes Various chemicals, polymers Some organic solvents, etc Fig. 3.8. Factors that activate complements in the classical and alternate pathways. trace contaminants from ultralters, dialyzers and chromatography (Chang and Lister, 1994). Use in research Why wait for the completion of research, industrial production and preclinical animal studies? Why don't we do this test right at thebeginning, during the research stage? If a new system is found to causecomplement activation at this stage, one can avoid tremendous wasteof time and money in further development, industrial production andpreclinical animal study (Table 3.5) (Chang and Lister, 1994). Use in industrial production We have also used this preclinical test to help others in industrial production (Chang and Lister, 1994; Chang et al. , 1993). Thus in one of the earlier industrial scale-ups of polyHb, this in vitro screening test showed that certain batches caused complement activation.By conducting this test further, it was shown that complementactivation was the result of using new ultraltrators.

Using the in vitro screening test, the cause was found to be the use of new ultraltrators that release material that activate complements.Repeated washing before use solves this problem CLINICAL TRIALS AND USES PRECLINICAL TRIAL FINAL SCREENING TEST ANALYSIS OF VARIATIONS IN POPULATION RESPONSES ultraltrators did not cause complement activation. Without this test, some batches could result in adverse effects of \"unknown causes\"in humans. Chromatography, ultraltrators, dialysis membranes andother separation systems are used extensively in the preparation ofdifferent types of blood substitutes. It is, therefore, important to screenfor the possibility of trace contaminants that could cause complementactivation. In the same way, different chemical agents and differentreactants used in industrial production could be similarly tested(Table 3.5). Correlation of in vitro complement activation to clinical symptoms What are the clinical implications of C3a levels in the above in vitro complement activation screening test? (Table 3.5) There are clinical data in dialysis patients using different types of hemodialysismembranes. The result shows that clinical symptoms appear whenApril 3, 2007 16:34 SPI-B446 Articial Articial Cells C3a is substantially elevated (Deane and Wineman, 1988). Increasing levels result in increasing severity of the symptoms. Symptoms includemyalgia, chest tightness, fever, chill and others. C3a is a smallermolecule (M.W. 9000) than C3 (M.W. 180,000). Therefore, once itis formed, C3a equilibrates rapidly across the capillaries. Thus, inmeasuring C3a in patients one has to do this within very short intervalsto catch the peak in C3a. The peak is reached in the rst 15 min. Afterthis, it declines rapidly to normal in 60 min. In following complementactivation in patients receiving blood substitutes, one has to catch thepeak. In the in vitro study, the C3a is retained inside the test tube and its concentration does not decline with time; therefore, the maximallevel of C3a would be available. Clinical trials and use in humans The in vitro test may be useful in large scale screening for human response (Chang and Lister, 1994). For example, it could be used tostudy variation in production batches; to study individual variations;and to analyze the response of different human populations, especiallywith different disease conditions. It is important to note that all thesecould be done without ever introducing any blood substitutes intohumans. 3.9. Design of Animal Study for Hemorrhagic Shock Different types of modied Hb have been shown to be effective in the resuscitation of hemorrhagic shock. However, some of the results needto be further analyzed as discussed below. Hemorrhagic shock model When a small volume of blood is lost, the use of fluid to replace the volume is enough to maintain blood pressure and perfusion. It is onlywhen a very large volume of blood is lost that modied Hb is needed(Table 3.6). Messmer (1988) has discussed volume replacement inhemorrhagic shock in some detail. Solutions for plasma replacementApril 3, 2007 16:34 SPI-B446 Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Regenerative... ch03 FA Oxygen Carriers Based on Nanobiotechnology 53 Table 3.6 Validity of Hemorrhagic Shock Models HEMORRHAGIC SHOCK MODELS (1)REMOVAL OF 30-40% BLOOD VOLUME Needs volume replacement Does not need rbc replacement An excellent model for testing volume replacement BUT not a valid model for testing rbc replacement using blood substitutes (2)REMOVAL OF 67% BLOOD VOLUME (WIGGER'S MODEL) Needs volume replacement Needs rbc replacement Thus a valid model for testing rbc replacement using blood substitutes include saline, Ringer's lactate, hypertonic saline, colloids and others. Most of the studies on volume replacement are based on bleeding 30-40% of the blood volume. These models are excellent for the study ofvolume replacement when red blood cell replacement is not needed.However, this model is not sensitive enough for testing the efcacy ofred blood cell replacement in hemorrhagic shock. Testing the effectiveness of blood substitutes for both volume and red blood cell replacement requires a more severe model(Table 3.6). Wigger's (1950) modied model involves two stages ofbleeding, resulting in the removal of 2/3 of the total blood volume. We modied the model using a chronic tail-cannulation technique (Tabata and Chang, 1982b) to form an unanesthetized model (Changand Varma, 1991). Another group used another chronic cannulationtechnique (Malcolm et al. , 1992) that works as well. Using these unanesthetized models, PolyHb blood substitutes are shown to bemore effective than standard volume replacement using 3 volumesRinger's 1985; Chang andVarma,1992). Experimental designs Different experimental designs have been used. Some experimentaldesigns are for a single blood replacement.

Long-term survival and recovery of 67% blood loss replaced with different types of solution. Only blood and PolyHb resulted in long-term survival. with other treatments or monitoring until recovery or death. This is more comparable to emergency replacement in major disasters orwars in the eld, i.e. outside the hospital settings with no constantmonitoring. Other experimental designs are for repeated infusionswith continuous monitoring to maintain the blood pressure. This ismore applicable to surgical or hospital settings. Some designs aremore suitable for battleeld injuries. Furthermore, some experimentsare acute experiments of a few hours. Here, only the vital signs arecontinuously monitored. For example, we studied the effect of a single transfusion on the long-term survival of animals. The results (Fig. 3.9) showed that onlywhole blood and polyHb were effective for the long-term recoveryof the animals. If we did not follow the long-term effects, theshort-term response would have shown that stroma-free Hb is aseffective as polyHb. Thus, proper experimental design is needed toshow the effectiveness of using this for specic clinical conditions.Some applications only require short-term effectiveness with constantmonitoring. Other applications may require longer-term effectivenesswithout the availability of constant monitoring or medical care. Thus, it is important not to make general conclusions regarding the effectiveness of blood substitutes in hemorrhagic shock or in otherapplications.April 3, 2007 Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Regenerative... ch03 FA Oxygen Carriers Based on Nanobiotechnology 55 3.10. General Discussions Regional differences and the potential of unknown infective agents must be included in any discussions of the future prospect ofblood substitutes. Also to be included is the degree of regulatoryrequirements. Blood substitutes are urgently needed in regions of theworld where there are severe shortages of donor blood because ofcultural or religious beliefs that cause people to be less willing todonate blood. They are also urgently needed in regions with higherincidences of infective agents like HIV and thus a higher potentialfor contaminated donor blood. It is less urgent in regions with alower incidence of HIV and where costly screening tests are beingused to screen out infective agents in donated blood. On the otherhand, it is important to remember the past unexpected outbreaks ofHIV and hepatitis C and the resulting contaminated donated bloodthat persisted for years until proper screening tests are developed.If this should happen again with some yet unknown agents, (e.g.avian flu and others), then it would again be disastrous if no bloodsubstitutes, even rst-generation blood substitutes, are immediatelyavailable. Past experience has shown that it takes many years todevelop ideas on blood substitutes into products and that lack of basicinformation has resulted in much failure and delays. It is importantto carry out basic research to gain important basic informationneeded for the simultaneous development of blood substitutes. Inthe meantime, two types of rst-generation nanodimension polyHbare in the nal stages of clinical trials in humans and one of thesehas been approved for routine clinical use in patients in South Africa. New nanodimension conjugated Hb is also being tested in clinical trials. Shortage of human Hb is being resolved by studies onrecombinant human Hb, placenta Hb, bovine Hb and generations of modied Hb are being developedthat can modulate the effects of nitric oxide for those clinicalapplications that may have potential problems related to oxygenradicals. PolyHb can be crosslinked to an enzyme to suppress thegrowth of tumors. A further development is the use of PEG-lipids orPEG-biodegradable polymer membranes to Articial Cells articial red blood cells containing Hb and complex enzyme systems. 3.11. Methods and Procedures For those entering this area of research for the rst time, a majorcomplaint would be the lack of any books containing laboratoryprocedures for the preparation and testing of blood substitutes. Thissection describe the procedures that readers can readily use in theirlaboratory for preparing and testing modied Hb. The following is asimplied laboratory method for preparing polyHb. Also describedare the experimental procedures for testing blood substitutes. Most ofthe basic laboratory principles are covered and these can form thebasis for extension into new approaches. The method is suitable forpreparing basic modied Hb for use in different laboratory research.However, it is not for use in preclinical or clinical applications.More detailed procedures are required in such settings, especiallyin the preparation of ultrapure stroma-free Hb.

In vitro screening test using human plasma before use in humans Laboratory procedure based on human plasma. Blood is obtained by clean venous puncture from human volunteers and put into 50 mlpolypropylene (Sastedt) heparinized tubes (10 IU heparin/ml of blood).Immediately separate plasma by centrifugation at 5500 gat 2 C for 20 min and freeze the plasma in separate portions at 70C. Do not use serum because coagulation initiates complement activation. EDTAshould not be used as an anticoagulant, because it interferes withcomplement activation. Immediately before use, the plasma sampleis thawed. 400 lambdas of the plasma are pipetted into 4 ml sterilepolypropylene tubes (Fisher). 100 lambdas of pyrogen-free saline(or Ringer's lactate) for injection is added to the 400 lambdas ofhuman plasma as control. One hundred lambdas of Hb or modiedHb are added to each of the other tubes containing 400 lambdasof human plasma. The reaction mixtures are incubated at 37 Ca t 60 rpm for 1 h in a Lab-Line Orbit Environ Shaker (Fisher Scientic,Montreal, Canada). After 1 h, the reaction is quenched by adding0.4 ml of this solution into a 2 ml EDTA sterile tube containing 1.6 mlof sterile saline. The samples are immediately stored at 70 C until analyzed.

Centrifugation is carried out at 10,000 gfor 20 min. After the nal step of inversion, the inside walls of the tubes are carefully blotted withQ-tips. The exact procedure and precise timing described above areimportant in obtaining reproducible results. The base line control levelof C3a complement activation will vary with the source and procedureof obtaining the plasma. Therefore, a control baseline level must be used for each analysis. Furthermore, all control and test studies should be carried out in triplicates. Much practice is needed to establish thisprocedure before using the method for the rst time. Reproducibilitymust be established before this test can be used. Procedure based on blood from nger pricks. Instead of using plasma and to obviate the need to withdraw blood with a syringe, a simplerprocedure involving obtaining blood from nger pricks can be carriedout as follows. 90Sterile methods are used to prick a nger. Blood is collected in heparinized microhematocrit tubes. The tubes are kept at4 C, then used immediately as follows. Each blood sample used in the test contains 80 ul of whole blood and 20 ul of saline. Each test solutionis added to a blood sample. Test solutions include saline (negativecontrol) and Zymosan (positive control) or Hb. This is incubated at37 C at 60 rpm. After 1 h of incubation, EDTA solution is added to the sample to stop the reaction. The analysis for C3a is then carried outas described. The test kit is based on ELISA C3a enzyme immunoassay(Quidel Co, San Diego, CA, USA). Animal study on hemorrhagic shock and exchange transfusion Animal model. Depending on the design of the experiment, the animal could be acutely cannulated under anesthesia. If a consciousanimal experiment is needed, the animals are prepared for chroniccannulation as follows. Sprague-Dawley rats, 340 \u00b140 g, from Charles River are randomly divided in groups of six ( n=6). They are allowed to acclimatize for four days. They then receive chroniccannulation as referred to above. During the 6-8 days of post-surgicalperiod, the catheters are flushed daily with sterile heparinized saline.Body weights and hematocrits are followed and only those theApril 3, 2007 SPI-B446 Articial 60 Articial Cells following values 6-8 days after surgery are used.These include average body weight of 361.14 \u00b110.53 g and hematocrit of 37 \u00b12.7%. In the case of conscious rats, they are partially restrained, allowing freeaccess to the tails and catheters. In anesthetized rats, cannulation andexperiment are carried out under general anesthetics. Each rat receivesintravenous heparin, 150 IU/kg. One arterial cannula is connected toa statham pressure transducer for measuring of blood pressure and heart rates. These are recorded continuously on a Grass polygraph recorder. After steady baseline recording, lethal hemorrhagic shock isinduced. This involves the removal of 67% total blood volume throughthe other arterial catheter at 0.5 ml/min, carried out in two stages.Removal of 36% of total blood volume is followed by a 10 min restperiod. The second stage involves the removal of 31% of total bloodvolume. Throughout the bleeding, the blood pressure is maintainedbetween 40 and 60 mm Hg. 67% of total blood volume is removedfrom each rat with an average time of 46.52 \u00b12.71 min.

Each rat is then returned to a separate cage. They are monitored for 14 days.

This is one of the frequently used experimental procedures to test the efcacy of a given blood substitute in normovolumic hemodilution. Anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley ratswith an average weight of 310 g are used. Cannulation of the femoral artery and femoral vein using 3 cm length PE10 tubing (0.28 mminner, 0.61 mm outer diameter, Clay Adams) connected into a largediameter 20-cm length of PE50 tubing (0.58 mm inner, 0.97 These are lled with heparin (500 USP units/ml). Bothcatheters are connected to a pump (for example, Minipulse-2 GelsonMedical Electronics) tted with tubing (0.89 mm inner). Rats areheparinized before exchange transfusion through the venous catheterat 60 units/100 g body weight. The polyHb solution is warmed to thebody temperature of 37 C and infused intravenously into the femoral vein. Simultaneously, blood from the animal is removed from thefemoral artery. The flow rate is maintained at 0.5 ml/min by adjustingthe peristaltic pump. This is monitored by measuring the volumeinfused and the volume collected.Vital signs, hemodynamics and othermeasurements can be carried out 2, Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Regenerative... ch04 FA CHAPTER 4 A Nanobiotechnologic Therapeutic that Transports Oxygen and Remove Oxygen Radicals: For Stroke, Hemorrhagic Shockand Related Conditions 4.1. Introduction As discussed in Chapter 3, polyhemoglobin (PolyHb) is being used in surgical settings in the last stages of clinical trials in North Americaand in routine clinical use in South Africa. PolyHb promises toplay an important role in surgery and the early stages of bloodloss. However, in order to use blood substitutes for other clinicalconditions like severe sustained hemorrhagic shock, stroke and soon, we have to consider the issue of oxygen radicals (Alayash, 2004;Chang, 1997a, 2006a). Red superoxide dismutase (SOD) and other enzymes,but in situations of prolonged and severe ischemia, even this is notenough. Furthermore, some PolyHbs are prepared from ultrapure Hbdevoid of any red blood cell enzymes. Our aim is, therefore, touse nanobiotechnology to assemble these biological molecules intoPolyHb-CAT-SOD, a therapeutic agent that not only contains enhancedantioxidant enzymes but also has the ability to carry oxygen. 4.2. Ischemia-Reperfusion In prolonged severe hemorrhagic shock, stroke and other ischemicconditions, there is insufcient supply of oxygen resulting in 2, Therapeutic Ischemia Reperfusion 63 Ischemia stimulates the of purines to converted into the xanthine oxidaseform at a rate proportional to the duration of ischemia. When the tissueis again perfused with oxygen, convertshypoxanthine into superoxide. Via several mechanisms, superoxideresults in the formation of oxygen radicals that can cause tissue injury. The enzymes in red blood cells help to prevent this to a limited extent. Thus, SOD converts superoxide into hydrogen peroxide that is in turn converted by CAT into water and oxygen. However, in severe andprolonged ischemia the normal amounts of these enzymes in the redblood cells are not enough to prevent ischemia-reperfusion injury. Wehave, therefore, prepared a PolyHb-CAT-SOD complex (PolyHb-CAT-SOD) with more CAT and SOD than are normally present in red bloodcells. The idea is to have an oxygen carrier with enhanced antioxidantenzymes which can act as a therapeutic agent in ischemia-reperfusion. 4.3. PolyHb-CAT-SOD This product is based on our earlier nding that polyHb can be prepared by crosslinking stroma-free Hb using a sebacyl chloride (Chang, 1964) (Fig. 2.2). As stroma-free Hbcontained red blood cell enzymes, the crosslinking also resulted in apolyHb-enzyme complex. The rst use of another bifunctional agent,glutaraldehyde, was to crosslink stroma-free Hb into polyHb, but withmore CAT added to augment the CAT activity (Chang, 1971b) (Fig. 2.2).CAT crosslinked into the polyHb-CAT complex in this way is muchmore stable than the enzyme in free solution. Thus, the CAT activityof the polyHb-CAT remained at 98% after 43 days when stored at 4 C (Chang, 1971b). On the other hand, the activity of free CAT in solutionfell to 10% in 35 days at 4 C. When stored at the body temperature of 37C, polyHb-CAT retained 50% of its CAT activity after 7 days, whereas the activity of the free enzyme fell rapidly to 50% after 1 day. We, therefore, used this principle to prepare PolyHb-CAT-SOD (D'Agnillo and Chang, 1998a) (Fig. 2.2). In this way, in addition toits antioxidant therapeutic component, PolyHb-CAT-SOD also Regenerative... ch04 FA 64 Articial Cells an oxygen carrier to supply the needed oxygen in ischemia. In the form of PolyHb-CAT-SOD, the enzymes stay in the circulation together withPolyHb that, in humans, has a half-life of 24 h. This is unlike the rapidremoval of free SOD and CAT from the circulation (10 and 20 min,respectively). Furthermore, unless crosslinked to Hb, these enzymesare not located in close proximity to Hb, and are thus less likely to giveadequate protection to Hb-initiated oxygen radicals. In vitro studies reveal that crosslinked Hb-SOD-CAT is effective in removing oxygen radicals and hydrogen hydroxide, and in minimizing damage to Hband release of iron. Our animal studies show that PolyHb-CAT-SODresults in a signicant decrease in oxygen radical related damage inan intestinal ischemia-reperfusion model as well as in a stroke model. 4.4. Enzyme Activities after Intravenous Injections The following study shows that free SOD and CAT are removed rapidly within a few minutes from the circulation after intravenousinfusion. On the other hand, after intravenous infusion of PolyHb-CAT-SOD, the enzyme activities remain in the circulation for hourswith the same half-time as PolyHb (D'Agnillo and Chang, 1998a)(Fig. 4.1). This study includes the use of the following solutionsinjected into Sprague Dawley rats: 1) Free Hb, and not crosslinked; 2) PolyHb-SOD-CAT (prepared using aglutaraldehyde/Hb at a molar ratio of 8:1 glut:Hb); 3) PolyHb-SOD-CAT (8:1 glut:Hb) that has been a polymerization. Plasma Hb concentration (Fig. 4.1) Free Hb shows a half-life of about 60 min (Fig. 4.1). A greatercirculation time is achieved following polymerization (8:1 glut:Hb).Ultraltration does not increase the retention time since ultraltrationthrough 100 kDa cut off membranes does not Nanobiotechnologic Oxygen Therapeutic for Ischemia Reperfusion 65 Fig. 4.1. Plasma circulation half-life in rats of (a) CAT (b) CAT (c) Hb in rats after I.V. injection of indicated solutions (300 mg Hb/kg). Data of eachpoint on the chart obtained from samples collected from 3 separate animals.(D'Agnillo & Chang 1998a.) decreases the fraction of free Hb molecules, resulting in a further increase in circulation time. SOD activity in plasma (Fig. 4.1) Free SOD is rapidly cleared from the circulation (t 1/24-6 min). PolyHb-SOD-CAT (8:1 glu:Hb) shows a greater retention of SODactivity with a biphasic clearance pattern. The rapid initial removalphase is likely related to some SOD that has not been crosslinked toPolyHb. Ultraltration removes the small fraction of non-crosslinkedSOD, thus increasing the circulation half-time signicantly. A higherdegree Articial Cells small fraction of non-crosslinked SOD, thus increasing the circulation half-time. CAT activity in plasma (Fig. 4.1) Free CAT is cleared rapidly (t 1/215 min). PolyHb-SOD-CAT (8:1) shows a greater retention of CAT activity. Ultraltration of PolyHb-SOD-CAT (8:1) through 100 kDa membranes does not removeunbound CAT (mw of CAT 232,000), and there is no change in thecirculation time compared with the unltered preparation. Greaterpolymerization (16:1) decreases the fraction of free CAT, resulting inan increase in the circulation time. Discussions Our present study shows that the circulation half-time of free SODin solution is about 4-6 min. This may explain why in humans asingle bolus injection of free SOD is ineffective against ischemia-reperfusion injuries. In theory, a continuous infusion of SOD and CATcan be given during and following the administration of PolyHb underconditions involving potential ischemia-reperfusion injuries. However,giving PolyHb-CAT-SOD would not continuous infusion.Furthermore, when in the PolyHb-CAT-SOD conguration CAT andSOD are in the closest proximity to the Hb molecules, since PolyHb,like Hb, is a potentially reactive protein in ischemia-reperfusion injury.It is also a potential source of heme and iron release that can furtherincrease oxygen radical formation in the Fenton reaction. Thus, in theform of PolyHb-CAT-SOD, the enzymes can act promptly to removeoxygen radicals released from reaction due to the effect of oxidants onHb. As well, PolyHb has a circulation half-life in humans of 24 h; whencrosslinked to polyHb, the enzymes circulate together with PolyHbfor the same length of time. In this way, the PolyHb is at all timesprotected by the antioxidant enzymes. After one episode of ischemia-reperfusion in hemorrhagic shock, myocardial infarction or cerebralischemia, further episodes can recur with varying degrees of severityand frequencies. When the enzymes are crosslinked together in theApril 2, 2007 Oxygen Therapeutic for Ischemia Reperfusion 67 form of PolyHb-SOD-CAT, the enzymes would continue to circulate with PolyHb, thus preventing any potential problems at all times. 4.5. Tests in Animal Models for Stroke and Hemorrhagic Shock The next step is to carry out a study using actual animal models of ischemia-reperfusion injuries comparing PolyHb-CAT-SOD withPolyHb. The three animal models chosen in ischemia-reperfusion in an ischemia-reperfusionhind limb model. The rst two are very sensitive to ischemia-reperfusion injuries, whereas the third one is not. As will be discussedin detail in a later section, after 60 min and 90 min of ischemia,respectively in the brain and intestine, reperfusion with PolyHbresults in ischemia-reperfusion injuries or increase in oxygen radicals.On the other hand, PolyHb-CAT-SOD does not have such adverseeffects on the intestine (Razak, D'Agnillo & Chang, 1997) or brain(Powanda & Chang, 2002). The hind limb is less metabolically activeand reperfusion with PolyHb after 90 min of ischemia does not haveany signicant increase in oxygen radical production (D'Agnillo &Chang, 1997c). 4.6. Ischemia-Reperfusion of the Intestine Severe hemorrhagic shock and the intestine Since PolyHb has no blood group antigens and can be stored for amuch longer time than donor blood even at room temperature, thereis the potential of using this onsite for the treatment of hemorrhagicshock. However, if the ischemia is severe and prolonged beforereperfusion, there could be ischemia-reperfusion injuries. In severesustained hemorrhagic shock, there is severe vasoconstriction of someorgans, especially the intestine and kidneys. Furthermore, the intestineis rich in xanthine oxidase that catalyzes the formation of superoxide. Thus, the intestine is very vulnerable to ischemia-reperfusion injury andApril 2, 2007 radical production assessed by the measurement of 3,4 dihydroxybenzoate in ischemic intestine perfused of ). Intestinal effluent samples are collected during reperfusion at the indicated times. Data are presented as means \u00b1 SD.denotes statistical signicance; P<0.05. (From Razack, D'Agnillo & Chang, 1997.) therefore it would be a sensitive model for testing ischemia-reperfusion injury. In severe sustained hemorrhagic shock, reperfusion with redblood cells that contain the normal amounts of CAT and SOD maynot be adequate to prevent ischemia-reperfusion. Since PolyHb-CAT-SOD can contain more enzymes than red blood cells, we tested thispreparation for reperfusion in an ischemia-reperfusion intestine model(Razack, D'Agnillo & Chang 1997). Figure 4.2 shows that the useof PolyHb for reperfusion results in a signicant increase in oxygenradicals. The use of PolyHb-CAT-SOD does not give rise to such anincrease in oxygen radicals. Test on effects of reperfusion on ischemic intestine The details of the rat model and the measurement of oxygen radicals are described in Section 4.11 under \"Methods and Procedures.\" 0.8 ml/min for10 min without recirculation. Outflows from portal 2, 2007 Articial Oxygen Therapeutic for Ischemia Reperfusion 69 collected, centrifuged, and the spun perfusates are stored at 80C for later analysis of hydroxyl radicals. In this analysis, hydroxylradical reacts with 4HB to form 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (3,4-DHBA).High performance liquid chromatography measures the 3,4-DHBAproduced and thus the amounts of hydroxyl radicals generated. Reperfusion using PolyHb resulted in signicant increases in the level of 3,4-DHBA corresponding to increases in hydroxyl radicals (Fig. 4.2). On the other hand, infusion of PolyHb-CAT-SOD only results in a minimal increase in hydroxyl radicals as measured by theproduction of 3,4-DHBA (Fig. 4.2). 4.7. Test in Combined Hemorrhagic Shock and Stroke Rat Model Prolonged hemorrhagic shock and stroke model Stroke is common in North America, claiming some 500,000 victims each year. The most common cause is arteriosclerosis, which resultsin narrowing and obstruction of blood vessels. Red blood cells, being8 micron in diameter, have difculty flowing through these partiallyobstructed vessels to supply the needed oxygen to the brain (Fig. 4.3).PolyHb, being a solution, can perfuse partially obstructed vessels betterthan red blood cells to supply the needed oxygen. However, whenan ischemic brain is perfused with an oxygen-rich solution, reactiveoxygen species will be generated, resulting in ischemia-reperfusioninjury. These oxygen radicals can lead to increased leakiness of theblood-brain barrier, brain edema and cell death (Fig. 4.3). The therapeutic agent, PolyHb-SOD-CAT, has the dual function of an oxygen carrier and the ability to remove oxygen radicals.Thus, we useda transient global ischemia-reperfusion rat brain model to compare theuse of this PolyHb-SOD-CAT solution with four other oxygen carryingsolutions: 1) PolyHb; 2) PolyHb with CAT and CAT added as solutionwithout crosslinking to polyHb; 3) puried Hb; and 4) oxygenatedsaline Reperfusions are initiated 1 h after ischemia and theeffects on blood-brain barrier and brain edema are followed for 6 h.Reperfusion with PolyHb-SOD-CAT solution did not result in brainApril 2, Articial Regenerative... ch04 FA 70 Articial Cells Fig. 4.3. Stroke is common and in North America and about 500,000 persons suffered from this each year.The most common cause is arteriosclerosis which results in narrowing and obstruction of blood vessels. Red blood cells being 8micron in diameter have difculty flowing through these partially obstructedvessels to supply the needed oxygen to the brain. PolyHb being a solutioncan perfuse partially obstructed vessels better than red blood cells to supplythe needed oxygen. However, when an ischemic brain is perfused with anoxygen-rich solution, reactive oxygen species would be generated resulting inischemia-reperfusion injury. Unlike PolyHb, PolyHb-SOD-CAT has the dualfunction of an oxygen carrier and the ability to remove oxygen radicals.(Figure adapted from Chang, Nature Rev Drug Discovery , 2005i.) edema and the effect on blood-brain barrier is minimal. On the other hand, when compared with the sham control, the use of the otherfour solutions resulted in brain edema and disruption of the blood-brain barriers (BBB). Theses studies show that in this transient globalApril 2, 2007 14:57 SPI-B446 Articial Oxygen Therapeutic for Ischemia Reperfusion 71 ischemia-reperfusion rat brain model, the PolyHb-SOD-CAT solution can carry oxygen to ischemic brain tissue without causing signicantischemia-reperfusion injury. Rat model of combined hemorrhagic shock and stroke This is a combined model of hemorrhagic shock and bilateral carotid arteries occlusion transient global ischemia-reperfusion rat model(Smith et al., 1984). Since the brain is particularly sensitive to ischemia- reperfusion injuries, we used this rat model for the studies describedin the rest of this Section (Powanda and Chang, 2002). The detailedprocedure for preparing this model is described in Section 4.11under \"Methods and Procedures.\" Male Sprague-Dawley rats (235-255 g) are anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of pentobartbital(Somnotol, 65 mg/kg). Blood is withdrawn from the left femoral-arterycannula to maintain the mean blood pressure at 30-35 mm Hg. Thenboth the common carotid arteries are temporarily occluded withmicrovascular clips to cut the circulation to the brain. Duration of stroke and reperfusion injuries First, we carried out studies to analyze the relationship between theduration of ischemia before reperfusion and the severity of ischemia-reperfusion injuries using an ischemia time of 0 (control), 20, 30, 40and 60 min, respectively (Powanda and Chang, 2002). After one hourof reperfusion, one of the oxygen carriers containing no enzymesis infused into the rats in each group: oxygenated saline, stroma-free Hb, PolyHb and sham control. The of the duration ofischemia before reperfusion on the blood-brain barrier is measuredusing Evans blue extravasations. Under normal conditions, the tightintercellular endothelial junctions of the brain capillaries do not allowthe albumin-bound dye, Evans blue, to enter from the circulatingblood. Ischemia-reperfusion injuries disrupt the blood-brain barrier,resulting in leakiness of the normally tight intercellular endothelialjunctions to the large albumin-bound dye molecule, Evans blue. Figure 4.4 summarizes the results obtained.The results show that for an ischemic duration up to 30 min, reperfusion does not signicantlyApril 2, 2007 72 Articial Cells Fig. 4.4. Reperfusion after 0, 20, 30, 40 or 60 min of ischemia. 60 min of ischemia resulted in the most signicant increase in Evans blue extravasationscompared with sham control ( P<0.01). (Powanda & Chang, 2002.) increase the disruption of blood-brain barrier, as shown by Evans blue measurement. An ischemia of 40 min signicantly increases thedisruption of the blood-brain barrier, with increased extravasations ofEvans blue. One hour of ischemia produced the most signicant effectand this is chosen for the following ischemia-reperfusion studies. Effects of different solutions on reperfusion injuries Ischemia is terminated in 1 h by removing the bilateral carotid arteriesocclusion and restoring the blood pressure by replacing the lost blood,using one of the solutions of each of the following groups: oxygenatedsaline, ultrapure PolyHb-SOD-CAT and sham control. Animals in thesham control group are subjected to the same surgical procedure asdescribed above, with the exception that ischemia is not induced andno infusion is carried out. Disruptions of blood-brain barrier This is based on the increased leakiness of the blood-brain barrier with resulting influx of Evans blue into cerebral tissues. Compared withthe other solutions, there is signicantly less increase in the cerebralApril 2, 2007 Nanobiotechnologic Oxygen Therapeutic for Ischemia Fig. 4.5. Evans blue extravasation. PolyHb-SOD-CAT signicantly attenuated the severity SF-Hb PolyHb. Statistical signicance is P<0.01. (From Powanda & Chang, 2002.) tissue Evans blue levels in the rats receiving Poly-SOD-CAT after one hour of ischemia, when followed for 2, 4 and 6 h (Powanda & Chang,2002) (Fig 4.5). In the other groups, by 2 h after reperfusion, thereare already signicant increases in cerebral tissue SOD and CAT (48 \u00b12\u00b5g and 56 \u00b14\u00b5g by the 6th h) (Fig 4.5). It is interesting to note that the solutions of SOD and CAT do not have thesame protective effect as when they are crosslinked into PolyHb-CAT-SOD. This is likely because in free solution, SOD and CAT are rapidlyremoved from the circulation within minutes. On the other hand, theenzymes in PolyHb-CAT-SOD circulate with PolyHb for hours. Brain edema Cerebral edema is measured as changes in cerebral water content. There is no signicant difference between the group that receivedApril 2, 2007 Articial 74 Articial Cells Fig. 4.6. Brain edema: changes in brain water content. The changes in brain water content of PolyHb-SOD-CAT treated animals are not signicantly different from that of the sham control. The increase in water contents ofsaline, SF-Hb, SF-Hb +SOD+CAT, and PolyHb are signicantly different from that of the sham control and PolyHb-SOD-CAT group by the 4thh continued to increase and thereon with time. Statistical signicanceisP<0.01. PolyHb-SOD-CAT one hour after ischemia and sham control group when followed for 2, 4 and 6 h, respectively (Powanda and Chang,2002) (Fig 4.6). On the other hand, signicant increases in cerebralwater content are observed for those groups that received the followingsolutions after one hour other solutions like oxygenated saline, SF Hband polyHb resulted in cerebral edema. Again, the results show thatCAT and SOD have to be crosslinked into PolyHb-CAT-SOD to beeffective in protecting against ischemia-reperfusion. 4.8. Discussion The above studies show that in ischemia-reperfusion, the use of PolyHb-SOD-CAT resulted in signicantly less production of oxygenradicals as compared with PolyHb. This difference, as is expected, isApril 2, 2007 Articial Nanobiotechnologic Oxygen Therapeutic for Ischemia Reperfusion 75 much more obvious in the case of ischemia-reperfusion of the intestine or brain. The intestine and brain are organs that are particularlysensitive to ischemia-reperfusion injury. On the other hand, the hindlimb is much less sensitive to ischemia-reperfusion injury even whenPolyHb is used. The attenuation in hydroxyl radical generation with PolyHb-SOD- CAT shows promise for its potential role as a protective therapeutic agent in clinical situations of ischemia and oxidative stress. Another area of potential application would be in organ transplantation. AKorean group (Chang, Lee et al. , 2004a and 2004b) has done this in experimental kidney and liver transplantations. Yet another area ofpotential application would be the prevention of reperfusion injuryassociated with the states where there is a period of no perfusion.One example is cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with circulatory arrest.Ischemia-reperfusion injury has been noted to occur after CPB inchildren undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease. However,further research is needed to study these potential applications. 4.9. Preparation and Characterization Method of preparation Typically, each gram of Hb is crosslinked with 3000 U of SOD and 300,000 U of CAT (D'Agnillo & Chang, 1998a).The ratio of Hb to SODand CAT (in mg/ml) is 1 : 0.009 : 0.0045. The very small amount ofenzymes results in minimal change in the relative amount of Hb. Thus,there is minimal change in the oxygen carrying capacity of PolyHb-CAT-SOD when compared with PolyHb. The ratio for the enzymecan be varied over a very wide range; thus, a much higher amountof enzymes can be included when needed. The detailed method isdiscussed under \"Methods and Procedures\" in Section 4.11. Molecular characterization of PolyHb-CAT-SOD A molecular weight distribution analysis is performed using two methods. One is based on gel ltration chromatography on a SephadexG-200 column equilibrated with 0.1 M 7.5. 2, Regenerative... ch04 76 Articial Cells Fig. crosslinked and non-crosslinked bovine SF-Hb are obtained by running 1 ml of the 10 \u00d7 diluted samples on Sephadex G-200 1.6 cm \u00d770 cm column (VT =105.5 ml, Vo=38 ml, equilibrated with 0.1 MTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and eluted at 11.5 ml/h. (Powanda & Chang, 2002.) based on HPLC molecular weight gel ltration analysis on a BioSep Sec S-3000 column (5000-700,000 kD exclusion limits, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). Since only trace amounts of antioxidant enzymes are used in relation to Hb, the molecular weight distribution of PolyHb-SOD-CAT is the same as that of PolyHb (Fig. 4.7). The ratio of Hbto SOD and CAT (as mg/ml) is typically 1:0.009:0.0045. into the PolyHb-CAT-SOD (Powanda &Chang, 2002) (Table 4.1).

A higher molar ratio of 16:1 leads toa slightly lower enzyme activity as shown in Table 4.1.

Effects of crosslinking procedure on metHb formation We have carried out an analysis of metHb formation (Quebec & Chang, 1995). During the crosslinking process, there is minimal formation ofmetHb when Hb is crosslinked with SOD and CAT (Fig. 4.9) (Quebec &Chang, 1995). When crosslinking is carried out with Hb alone, there is a marked formation of metHb during the preparative procedure. Thus, PolyHbcontains higher starting levels of metHb compared with PolyHb-SOD-CAT. This shows that crosslinking Hb with SOD and CAT mayalso provide oxidative protection during the preparation of PolyHb(Quebec & 1995).April 2, 2007 Cells Fig. 4.8.

Vitro Studies of the Antioxidant Properties of Crosslinked HB-SOD-CAT We found that in scavenging H2O2and oxygen-derived free Therapeutic concentration of SOD-CAT crosslinked with Hb. Oxidative challenge with H 2O2resulted in minimal changes in the absorbance spectra of PolyHb-SOD-CAT. With PolyHb, there are spectral changes reflectingthe formation of metHb and heme degradation. Furthermore, theamount of iron released, after incubation with H 2O2, is signicantly reduced when PolyHb-SOD-CAT is used as compared to PolyHb.Theseresults show that crosslinked PolyHb-SOD-CAT decreases oxidativereactions. More detailed description follows. Scavenging of superoxide (O 2) Unlike PolyHb, PolyHb-CAT-SOD effectively removes superoxide that is enzymatically-generated. In this study, the level of superoxide ismeasured as the rate of reduction of cytochrome c by superoxide(Fig. 4.10). The higher the level of superoxide, the faster will thesuperoxide reduce cytochrome c. The detailed method of analysis Fig. 4.10. (A) Reduction of cytochrome c by xanthine/xanthine oxidase- generated superoxide, in the presence of PolyHb or PolyHb-SOD-CAT (5 \u00b5M). The reaction was started by adding xanthine oxidase.

Error barsrepresent the standard Regenerative... Articial Cells is given in Section 4.11 under \"Methods and Procedures.\" PolyHb is not effective in removing superoxide as shown by a cytochromec reduction rate of 2.13 nmoles cyt. c/min. On the other hand,PolyHb-CAT-SOD effectively removes superoxide, and the loweredsuperoxide is shown by the much lower cytochrome c reduction rateof 0.56 nmoles cyt. c/min. (Fig. 4.10). Hb does not interfere with thereaction, since the rate of reduction in PolyHb mixtures is the sameas that in the buffer alone. Increasing the SOD concentrations in thePolyHb-CAT-SOD increases the rate of superoxide removal (Fig. 4.10). Scavenging of hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) In the reaction mixtures containing 25, 50, 100 or 200 \u00b5Mo fH 2O2, addition of PolyHb did not result in any signicant decrease in theH 2O2level (Fig. 4.11). However, the addition of PolyHb-CAT-SOD markedly reduces the H 2O2level (Fig. 4.11) The H 2O2scavenging activity increases with increasing concentrations of CAT in the PolyHb-CAT-SOD preparation (Fig. 4.11). Fig. 4.11. (A) Peroxidase-catalyzed measurement of H 2O2in 3 ml reaction volumes containing added H 2O2and either PolyHb (5 \u00b5M) or PolyHb-SOD- CAT (5 \u00b5M).

(From D'Agnillo & Chang, 1993.)April 2, Oxygen Therapeutic for Ischemia Reperfusion 81 Effects of oxidative challenge on the degradation of Hb and iron release in PolyHb and PolyHb-CAT-SOD Oxygen radicals can oxidize the Fe2+-heme component of Hb to Fe3+-heme that can stimulate the production of superoxide (O 2).9 Furthermore, excessive oxidative damage to Hb leads to the release of iron from heme. In the presence of free iron, O 2,H2O2rapidly react to produce hydroxyl radical (OH) (i.e. Fenton reaction). O 2+Fe3+Fe2++O2 H2O2+Fe2+Fe3++OH+OH O 2+H2O2OH+OH+O2 Hydrogen peroxide can also react with Hb to produce ferrylHb. These can promote cellular injury by reacting with carbohydrates, nucleic acids and proteins. These reactive species can also methylene hydrogen from polyunsaturated fatty acids resultingin lipid peroxidation. We carry out the following studies to determinewhether PolyHb-CAT-SOD can prevent these effects on PolyHb. Absorbance spectra and Hb degradation We use absorbance spectra to follow the effects of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide on the Hb components of PolyHb and PolyHb-CAT-SOD (D'Agnillo & Chang, 1998a) (Fig. 4.6). Xanthine-xanthine oxidaseis used to generate superoxide (Fig. 4.12 ABC). For PolyHb, this resultsin a stepwise decrease in absorbance at 540 and 577 showingthat (Fe 2+) Increase in metHb (Fe3+) is shown as a stepwise increase at the absorbance peak of 630 nm (Fig. 4.6A). PolyHb-CAT-SOD with a SOD/CAT ratio of 0.01prevents this oxidation (B), while a SOD/CAT ratio of 100 producesno protective effect (Fig. 4.12C). A glucose-glucose oxidase systemis used to generate hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 4.12 DEF). The ferryl(Fe 4+) intermediate is shown by the appearance of new peaks at 545 and 580 nm (Fig. 4.12D). PolyHb-CAT-SOD with a SOD/CAT ratio of0.01 reduces oxidation (Fig. 4.5E), while a SOD/CAT ratio of 100produces no effect 4.12F).April 2, 82 Articial Cells Fig. 4.12. Absorbance spectra of reaction mixtures containing 50 \u00b5Mo fH b and 100 \u00b5M of glucose oxidase ( right). SOD/CAT in each mixture are shown. Each panel represents a series of spectra collected over a period of20 min at 1 scan/min. In the absence of CAT or even the addition of 3 U/ml ofCAT, there is still inadequate protection from the effects of hydrogen peroxide.300 U/ml of CAT to have signicant protective effects. (D'Agnillo & Chang,1998a.) In a separate study (Fig. 4.13), hydrogen peroxide is added to PolyHb (10 mM) or PolyHb-SOD-CAT (10 mM), and the absorbancespectra (450-700 nm) is followed (Fig. 4.13). For PolyHb, the spectralchanges reflect the oxidation of ferrous (Fe 2+)-heme to ferric (Fe3+)- heme (Fig. 4.13AB). The rate of degradation increases with increasein hydrogen peroxide added in amounts from 10 to 100 to 500 \u00b5M. The absorbance spectra of PolyHb-CAT-SOD are minimally affected, indicating that these reactions are minimized due to the eliminationof H 2O2(Fig. 4.13CD).

Release of iron The next step is to study the impact of oxidative challenges on iron released from PolyHb and PolyHb-CAT-SOD. The methods arediscussed in Section PolyHb(15\u00b5M) or PolyHb-SOD-CAT (15 \u00b5M) are incubated with different concentrations of H 2O2for 1 h at 37C. We use the Ferrozine assay method to measure the release of iron. For PolyHb, the addition ofH 2O2leads to the release of up to 37% of the total iron in PolyHb (Fig. 4.14A). On the other hand, for PolyHb-CAT-SOD, less than 1% ofthe total iron is released for the same amount of H 2O2.

(From D'Agnillo & Chang, 1993.) to note that decreasing the amount of CAT crosslinked to the PolyHb- CAT-SOD will decrease the protective effects on the release of ironduring H 2O2incubation (Fig. 4.14B). Lipid peroxidation and salicylate hydroxylation Other important mechanisms are related to lipid peroxidation andsalicylate hydroxylation. As shown in Fig. 4.15 (left), adding 50 \u00b5M or 500 \u00b5M of hydrogen peroxide to PolyHb in the presence of lipid resulted in very signicant increases in lipid peroxidation. On the otherhand, the addition of 500 \u00b5M of hydrogen peroxide to PolyHb-SOD- CAT causes signicantly less lipid peroxidation (D'Agnillo & Chang,1998b). Similarly, the addition of 500 \u00b5M of hydrogen peroxide to PolyHb causes salicylate hydroxylation (Fig. 4.15 right). However, thisdoes not happen for the case of PolyHb-SOD-CAT.April 2, 2007 SPI-B446 Articial Nanobiotechnologic Oxygen Therapeutic for Ischemia Reperfusion 85 Fig. 4.15.

All the analyticalgrade.April 2, Cells Preparative procedures for PolyHb prepared Hb (7g/dl), SOD (1050 U/ml), and CAT (21,000 U/ml) in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4 (D'Agnillo and Chang, 1998). The nal ratio is 1g Hb:15,000 U SOD:300,000 U U/dl) in0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (PBS) (pH 7.4). For the PolyHbmixtures, an equivalent volume of buffer replaces enzyme addition.Prior to the start of crosslinking, lysine is added at a molar ratioof 10:1 lysine:Hb. Crosslinking reaction is started with the additionof glutaraldehyde at a molar ratio of 8:1 or 16:1 glutaraldehyde:Hb.Glutaraldehyde is added in four equal aliquots over a period of 10-15 min. Non-crosslinked preparations consist of the identical mixturesexcept that a buffer is added instead of glutaraldehyde. After 3.5 hat 4 C under aerobic conditions with constant stirring, the reaction is stopped with excess lysine at a molar ratio of 100:1 lysine:Hb.Solutions are dialyzed Aliquots (300 \u00b5l) of the 8:1 crosslinked preparation are concentrated using 100 kDa microconcentrators(Amicon, Beverly, MA). Samples are centrifuged at 3000 gfor 25 min at 23 C. After the rst spin, the retentate is collected, diluted, and spun again. The nal retentates are diluted and pooled. The Hb concentration is determined by cyanometHb measurement at 540 nm. Measurement of SOD activity SOD activity is determined by cyctochrome c reduction assay. Oneunit of SOD is dened as the amount of enzyme that inhibits therate of cytochrome c reduction by 50% under specied conditions. The reagent solution consisted of xanthine (50 \u00b5M), cytochrome c (10\u00b5M), and CAT (500 units/ml) in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.8. CAT added to the reagent solutionprevented interference due to the Hb-hydrogen peroxide interactions. The reaction volumes are prepared containing the test sample (25 \u00b5l of 0.6 g/dl), reagent solution (1.45 ml), and xanthine oxidase (25 \u00b5l of 0.2 units/ml) to start the reaction. The initial rate of cytochrome cApril 2, 2007 Nanobiotechnologic Oxygen Therapeutic for Ischemia Reperfusion 87 reduction is monitored at 550 nm using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 4B Spectrophotometer. Measurement of CAT activity CAT activity is assessed by measuring the decomposition of hydrogenperoxide at 240 nm. The spectrophotometer is zeroed with twocuvettes (1 ml) containing the test sample (10 \u00b5l of 0.6 g/dl) in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. In the experimental samples,hydrogen peroxide (250 \u00b5l of 30 mM) is added instead of a buffer, and the absorbance at 240 nm is monitored for 36 sec. The disappearancerate of hydrogen peroxide is used as a measure of CAT activity. Hydrogen peroxide scavenging Reaction volumes (3 ml) containing the horseradish peroxidase/4-aminoantipyrine/phenol reagent solution (1.2 ml), PolyHb or PolyHb-SOD-CAT (5 mM), water, and hydrogen peroxide are prepared.Identical mixtures containing no H 2O2served as blanks. After allowing the mixture to stand for 3 min at 22C, the absorbance at 505 nm is recorded. Hydrogen peroxide and the reagent solution participate ina peroxidase-catalyzed reaction to form a dye which can be measuredat this wavelength. Ratio of SOD/CAT and Hb oxidation Reaction volumes are prepared containing 50 \u00b5M (as heme) in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4 and varying ratios of SOD/CAT (0, 1,100), with the nal enzyme activities of 3 or 300 units. Samples alsocontained either xanthine (100 \u00b5M)/xanthine oxidase (10 mU/ml) or glucose (10 mM)/ glucose oxidase (10 \u00b5g/ml). Reactions (total volume 1 ml) are started with the addition of the oxidase enzymes at 23 C. The absorbance spectra (500-700 nm) are recorded at 1 scan/min for 25 min using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda B spectrophotometer. Measurement of FerrylHb Hydrogen peroxide (5, 50 and 500 \u00b5M) is added to reaction volumes containing 50 \u00b5M PolyHb or PolyHb-SOD-CAT in 50 phosphate, pH 7.4. Xanthine (100 \u00b5M)/xanthine oxidase (10 mU/ml) is used as the oxidation system in separate experiments. At given timeintervals, excess CAT is added to remove residual hydrogen peroxidein both the oxidation systems. Sodium sulde (2 mM) is added to themixtures, and the absorbance is measured at 620 nm. Blank samplesconsisted of measuring absorbance in similar mixtures except thatwater is added instead of hydrogen peroxide. Iron release study Hydrogen peroxide is added to 50 \u00b5M of PolyHb or PolyHb-SOD-CAT in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. At specied time intervals, thereaction is terminated by adding excess CAT. After 2-3 min, ascorbicacid (0.5 ml of 0.02%) is added and mixed for 5 min. Trichloroaceticacid (0.5 ml of 20%) is then added to precipitate proteins. The 1.5 mlmixture is centrifuged, and the supernatant (1 ml) is added to anammonium acetate buffer (0.45 ml) and a ferrozine reagent (50 \u00b5l). The absorbance of iron color complex is measured at 560 nm. The amount of iron released is calculated by measuring the absorbance ofan iron standard (500 \u00b5g/dl), (treated as described above) against H 2O blank. Measurement of iron: The rst step is to incubate PolyHb (15 mM) or PolyHb-SOD-CAT (15 mM) in hydrogen peroxide (total volume,0.5 ml) for 60 min at 37 C. CAT is added to remove the residual H2O2, then ascorbic acid (0.5 ml of 0.02%) is added and mixed for 5 min. Trichloroacetic acid (0.5 ml of 20%) is then added to precipitateproteins. The 1.5 ml mixture is centrifuged, and the supernatant (1 ml)is added to an ammonium acetate buffer (0.45 ml) and a ferrozinereagent (50 ml). The iron color complex is measured at 560 nm. Theamount of iron released is calculated by measuring the absorbanceof an iron standard (500 mg/dl) (0.5 ml), (treated as described above)against blank (0.5 ml H 2O). Circulation time studies Fasted male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-275 g, Charles River,St-Constant, QC ) are i.p. (Somnotol, Becton Dickinson, NJ). Following a 15 min stabilization period, a bolus infusion of the test solution (300 mg Hb/kg rat) is givenvia the femoral vein. Femoral venous samples (0.5 ml) are centrifugedat 15,600 g for 5 min. Recovered plasma is stored at 80 C. Rat model of intestinal ischemia-reperfusion Fasted male Sprague-Dawley rats (280-310 g) are anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection (Somnotol, 65 mg/kg). Thisis followed by midline laparotomy. The left and right renal pediclesare mobilized, isolated and ligated. The abdominal aorta is isolatedand cannulated just proximal angiocath, Critikon, Tampa, Fl) to this ligation and cannulated and afxed ina similar manner with a 22 gauge angiocath. At this point, midlinesternotomy is performed and the thoracic IVC and descending aortaare isolated and ligated. Intestinal ischemia is taken to begin at thispoint. A closed circuit for intestinal and liver perfusion is createdwith the aortic cannula as the inlet and the IVC cannula as theoutlet (Fig. 2). The system is flushed with 20 ml of heparinized(10 units/ml) lactated Ringer's solution delivered by a peristaltic pumpat 0.8 ml/min. After this, the portal vein is isolated and cannulatedwith a 20 gauge angiocath and xed in place by ligature of the vessel. After a 90 min ischemic time, PolyHb or PolyHb-SOD-CAT (5 g/dl) containing 5 mM of 4HB is perfused at 0.8 ml/min for 10 min withoutrecirculation. Portal vein effluent samples are collected, centrifuged,and the centrifuged perfusate is stored at 80 C for later analysis by high performance liquid chromatography. Measurement of oxygen radical Hydroxyl radical generation is assessed by an aromatic hydroxylationtechnique with 4-hydroxybenzoate (4-HB). Reaction of 90 Articial Cells Combined hemorrhagic shock and transient global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion Procedure for rat model: Global cerebral ischemia is induced by bilateral common carotid arteries (BCCA) occlusion with hemorrhagichypotension (to lower the mean blood pressure) (Flothe andOtting, 1984). Male Sprague-Dawley injection of pentobartbital (Somnotol, 65 mg/kg). The rectal temperature is maintained at 38 C during the experiments. The right femoral artery is cannulated to allow continuous recording of the arterial blood pressure. The left femoral vein and artery arecatheterized for intravenous injection and induction of hypotension,respectively. The left and right common carotid arteries are isolatedand ready for later initiation of global cerebral ischemia. The animalsare allowed to rest for 30 min. After this, 5 ml of blood is withdrawnfrom the left femoral-artery cannula to reduce the mean blood pressureto 35 mm Hg; and both the common carotid arteries are temporarilyoccluded with microvascular clips to prevent circulation flow tothe brain. During the occlusion period, the mean blood pressure ismaintained by withdrawing or reinfusion of blood. Baseline studies on blood-brain barrier: Baseline studies are rst carried out to analyze the duration of ischemia needed to result insignicant ischemia-reperfusion effects when followed by reperfusion. The duration of ischemia studied is: 0, 20, 30, 40 and 60 min. This is followed by reperfusion using one of the following \"baseline\"solutions: 1) oxygenated saline solution; 2) polyHb solution; and One later, the ischemia-reperfusion effect is measuredby Evans blue extravasation. This is compared with a Sham-controlwhere only surgery is carried out but without hypotension or occlusionof the common carotid arteries (no ischemia) and no infusion (noreperfusion). Studies on blood-brain barrier and brain edema: Based on the result obtained, an ischemia duration of one hour is chosen for the followingdetailed studies. Ischemia is terminated 1 h after the occlusion of thecommon carotid arteries by removing the Nanobiotechnologic Oxygen Therapeutic for Ischemia Reperfusion 91 followed by the isovolumic replacement of the lost blood using one of the following solutions at a rate of 0.8 ml/min: 1) oxygenated salinesolution; 2) Hb and CAT; and 5) PolyHb-SOD-CAT. After presetperiods of 1, 2, 4 an d 6 h following reperfusion of each of the above solution, the animals are sacriced and the effects on blood-brainbarrier and brain edema measured. The results are compared withSham-control groups, where only surgery is carried out but withoutocclusion of the common carotid arteries (no ischemia) and no infusion(no reperfusion). Blood-brain barrier and brain water content measurement: We use the method of Chan et al. (1991) with the following modications. Evans Blue, 0.1 ml (4%) in 0.9% saline solution is administeredthrough the left femoral veins. For animals in the 1-, 2-, 4- and6-h experimental groups, Evans Blue is injected at 0,1, 2, 4 and6 h after reperfusion and allowed to circulate for 30 min. Afterthis, a thoracotomy is carried out on each animal, followed byclamping of the descending limb of the aorta and inferior venacava with microvascular clips. The left and right external jugularveins are then cut and each animal is perfused with 5 ml of0.9% saline at room temperature through the aorta via the leftventricle using a peristaltic pump at a rate of 0.8 ml/min. Thebrains of the animals are quickly removed to obtain the forebrain.Each forebrain is weighed to obtain the wet weight and thendried at 105 C for 1 week, then reweighed to obtain the dry weight. To measure the extravasation of Evans Blue, the forebrainis then placed in 2 ml of 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4, for another week. The samples are then homogenized in PBS and centrifuged at 1000 gfor 5 min. Samples of 0.7 ml of the supernatants are mixed with an equivalent volume, 0.7 ml, of 12% (w/v) trichloroaceticacid. The mixtures are incubated at 4 C for 18 h, then centrifuged at 1000 gfor 30 min. The Evans Blue concentration of the supernatants is quantitatively measured at 610 nm for absorbance. The water content of each forebrain is calculated as the difference between the forebrain wet weight and its dry weight (waterApril 2, 2007 SPI-B446 Articial 92 Articial Cells content =wet weight - dry weight). The changes in water content of the forebrain, as presented in Fig. 4.6, is calculated as the differencebetween the forebrain water contents obtained from 1-, 2-, 4- and6-h groups and that of the 0-h group. Change in water content offorebrain =Water content i- Water content 0(where i =1, 2, 5 Nanotechnology-based Articial Red Blood Cells (RBCs) 5.1. Introduction As discussed in the previous two chapters, investigators have successfully used the basic principles of nanobiotechnology-basedblood substitutes to develop clinically useful polyHb and conjugatedHb (Chang, 1964, 1965, 1972a). Are we now ready to ask the nextquestion? Is it possible to develop the more complete articial redblood cells (Chang 1967, 1964) for clinical use in patients? In nature, hemoglobin and complex enzyme systems are retained inside red blood cells (Fig. 5.1). In this way, they can carry outtheir functions: to transport oxygen and carbon dioxide, removeoxygen radicals and prevent hemoglobin from being oxidized intomethemoglobin. It has been showed as far back as 1957 (Chang, 1957),that the contents of red blood cells can be enveloped in articial redblood cells using ultrathin polymer membranes (Fig. 5.1). In this form,the hemoglobin and the enzyme systems normally present in red bloodcells are retained inside the membranes. At the same time, oxygenand carbon dioxide can equilibrate rapidly across the membranesto interact with the enclosed materials (Chang, 1957, 1964). Themembranes of the articial red blood cells would not become fragileafter prolonged in vitro storage. The articial red blood cells could be transfused without cross-matching, since they do not have any bloodgroup antigens. In order to develop this basic idea of a completearticial red blood cell for practical applications, researchers from 93April 13, 1995 10:54 SPI-B446 Articial ARTIFICIAL RBC's (Chang 1957,1964) 1\u00b5 or largerRBC MEMBRANE ARTIFICIAL MEMBRANE 7-8 \u00b5 CO2O2 Fig. 5.1. Upper : Composition of red blood cells and articial red blood cell. Lower left : Red blood cells. Lower right : First articial rbc's of 1 micron or Nanotechnology-based Articial Red Blood Cells 95 around the world have devoted a tremendous amount of effort to the research. There are three steps in the development of a complete articial rbc (Fig. 5.1), i.e. developing: 1) a micron dimension articial redblood cell; 2) lipid red cell;3) a nanodimension biodegradable articial rbc. 5.2. Micron Dimension Articial RBCs with Ultrathin Polymeric Membrane The rst attempt at preparing an articial red blood cell involved replacing the red blood cell membrane with an ultrathin polymericmembrane (Chang, 1957). This results in an articial rbc with the samecontents as those in a rbc, but with an articial membrane instead ofthe red blood cell membrane. Hemoglobin The content of rbc, hemolysate, enveloped in a butyl benzoate coated collodion membrane articial cell, contains a combination and methemoglobin. The oxyhemoglobin retains itsability to combine reversibly with oxygen (Fig 5.2) (Chang, 1957). Chang and Poznansky (1968a) showed that if additional catalase is enclosed along with the red blood cell hemolysate, there is a markedreduction in methemoglobin formation. In the case of nylon membranearticial cells, the preparative procedure results in the formation ofa much higher proportion of methemoglobin (Chang, 1964, 1965).Red cell hemolysate enclosed in silastic rubber articial cells (Chang,1966) remains unaltered and can combine reversibly with oxygen. A Japanese group has also supported these ndings. They showed that hemoglobin microencapsulated within polymer anhydrase anhydrase, present at high concentration in rbc's, plays animportant role in the transport of carbon dioxide. anhydraseApril 13, 1995 Concentration)1.85 1.861.87 1.88 1.89 1.90 20 40 60 80 100 120 140OXYGEN DISSOCIATION CURVE Microencapsulated hemoglobin blood substitute (Computer scan from the original Chang 1957 graph) O2 mmHg Fig. 5.2. Oxygen dissociation curve of collodion membrane articial rbc's (scanned from Chang, 1957). of the red blood cell hemolysate enclosed in articial cells with collodion, nylon, or cross-linked protein membranes, retains its activity(Fig. 5.3) (Chang, 1964, 1965). The carbonic anhydrase activity was measured as the rate of fall of pH when carbon dioxide was bubbled through a buffered suspension. Articial rbc's and rbc's both accelerate the rate of fall of pH (Fig. 5.3).Acetazolamide completely inhibited the catalytic activity of both rbc's and articial rbc's with membranes of nylon, cross-linked protein, orcollodion. Samples of buffered saline that had been in contact withtheir own volume of articial rbc's for 24 h showed no detectableenzyme activity, indicating that the enclosed carbonic anhydrase hadnot leaked out during this period. Carbonic anhydrase in articialcells have about 75% of the activity Red Blood Cells 97 Fig. 5.3. Carbonic anhydrase activity measured as rate of fall of pH as carbon dioxide is bubbled into the respective solution (modied from Chang, 1964). carbonic anhydrase in articial rbc's acts efciently in catalyzing carbon dioxide. Catalase Catalase is another important component of mammalian rbc's. Wehave analyzed the catalase activity of collodion membrane articialcells containing hemolysate (Chang, 1967; Chang and Poznansky,1968a). Both its natural substrate, hydrogen peroxide, and its chemicalsubstrate, sodium perborate, have been used. Catalase enclosed incollodion membrane articial cells acts efciently in vitro . It also acts efciently in vivo for enzyme replacement therapy in mice with a congenital defect in their red blood cell catalase (Chang andPoznansky, 1968a). This will be described in detail in the next chapter. Immunological studies Human ABO blood group antisera cause marked agglutination ofboth incompatible human rbc's and heterogeneous rbc's. On theother hand, these antisera do not cause 13, Cells rbc's containing rbc hemolysate, even though the hemolysate has been obtained from incompatible human rbc's or heterogeneous rbc's(Chang, 1972a). Thus, an articial red blood cell membrane doesnot appear to possess the blood group antigens normally present inbiological cell membranes. 5.3. Intravenous Injection Polymeric membrane articial RBCs 1 micron and larger The fate of intravenously injected nylon membrane articial cells containing hemolysate has been studied (Chang, 1964, 1965, 1972a). A suspension of 5 \u00b5\u00b12.5\u00b5diameter (mean \u00b1standard deviation) nylon membrane articial rbc's was infused intravenously over a period of1.5 min, and samples were obtained from the anesthetized cat duringand following the infusion. The arterial level rose steeply during infusion, but upon dis- continuation of the infusion, the level fell rapidly (Fig. 5.4). Thus, mostof the articial cells successfully completed one or more circulations,after which they were removed rapidly from the bloodstream.Experiments using 51Cr-labeled nylon membrane articial cells showed that most of them were removed by the lung, liver, orspleen. Collodion membrane articial cells are also removed rapidlyfrom the circulation. Thus, it appears that nylon and collodionmembrane articial cells smaller than rbc's are rapidly removed fromthe circulation. During the infusion, there is a fall in arterial bloodpressure and an increase in venous pressure and other signs compatiblewith pulmonary embolism. These articial rbc's do not have thedeformability of rbc's that allows the latter to pass through capillariesof smaller diameters. Can articial rbc's survive longer if they are made much smaller in order that they can pass through the capillaries? Unfortunately, it haslong been known that even submicron foreign particles are removedvery rapidly from the circulation (Halpern et al. , 1958). After all, this is part of the body's defence against circulating microorganisms andother foreign particles. Thus, we looked into another factor, the surfaceApril 13, 1995 10:54 SPI-B446 Nanotechnology-based Articial Red Blood Cells 99 Fig. 5.4. Circulation time of articial rbc's after infusion (from Chang 1965, 1972a). property of articial cells (Chang, 1964, 1965, 1972a). Red blood cells and other formed elements of blood have a negative surfacecharge due to the presence of n-acetylneuraminic acid containingmucopolysaccharide on the red blood cell membrane (Cook et al. , 1961). Danon and Marikovsky (1961) found that the younger rbc'swere about 30% more strongly charged than the older ones obtainedfrom the same blood sample. All this information led us to look intothe effects of surface properties on circulation time for rbc's, foreignparticles, and articial rbc's (Chang, 1965,1972a). Neuraminic acid and circulation time of red blood cells We rst studied the effects of removing neuraminic acid from rbc's on their survival in the circulation (Chang 1965,1972a; Chang andApril 13, 1995 Regenerative... ch05 FA 100 Articial Cells MacIntosh, 1964). Experiments on the survival of autologous51Cr- labeled rbc's were carried out using four dogs (Fig. 5.5). First,51Cr- labeled rbc's obtained from each of the dogs were reinjected. Theystayed in the circulation with the usual lifetime of about three tofour months for dog rbc's. The second injection consisted of rbc'sobtained from each of the dogs and then treated with neuraminidase toremove neuraminic acid. The procedure for the use of neurominidaseto remove neuraminic acid follows that of Cook et al. (1961). Removal of neuraminic acid resulted in the rapid removal of these rbc's fromthe circulation, with the level falling exponentially with a half-timeof only about 2 h (Fig. 5.5). The third injection consisted of normal 51Cr-labeled rbc's obtained from each of the dog. The circulation time Fig. 5.5. Circulation time of reinfused autologous dog rbc's, tagged with51Cr. Data from four dogs: each point represents the radioactivity of one bloodsample from a limb vein. In each case, the rst and third tests were withnormal rbc's from the same dog. The second test was with neuraminidase-treated rbc obtained previously from the same dog. Ordinates give percentageof injected label in circulation at time of sampling. Note rapid disappearanceof neuraminidase-treated rbc's. (From Chang, Articial Red Blood Cells 101 was not signicantly different from that for the rst injection. These results led to our suggestion that the survival of rbc's may be related tothe neuraminic acid present in the membranes (Chang, 1965, 1972a;Chang and MacIntosh, 1964). Effects of surface charge of polymeric particles on circulation time These results led to the investigation of a simpler model system (Chang, 1965,1972a). Polystyrene latex particles (Dow Chemical Co.) withdiameters of 2.05 \u00b5\u00b10.018 \u00b5(mean \u00b1S.D.) were diluted 1: 100 in saline. A similar suspension was prepared using polystyrene latexsulfonated for 30 sec by Ag 2SO4and H 2SO4, and then washed with saline (Chang, 1965, 1972a). With the sulfonated polystyrene latex,the initial counts were close to the expected number. Then the leveldeclined, rst rapidly and then more slowly. In the case of the controlpolystyrene latex particles, there constituted only 10 to 15% of theinjected particles in the circulation in the initial count 1/2min after injection. The level then fell much more steeply, with a half-time ofabout 15 to 30 sec. Further experiments showed that the sulfonatedpolystyrene latex particles were not trapped to any extent by thelung, but were removed by the reticuloendothelial system. The controlpolystyrene latex particles, on the other hand, were trapped fairlyefciently by the lung, and very efciently by the reticuloendothelialsystem. Articial rbc's with sulfonated nylon membrane The above results led us to prepare articial cells with sulfonated nylon membranes (Chang, 1965, 1972a); sulfonated diamine suchas 4,4'-diamino-2,2'-diphenyldisulfonic acid (Chang, 1964, 1965,1972a; Chang et al., 1966). Sulfonated nylon membrane articial cells of varying surface negative charges can be prepared by addingdifferent amounts of the sulfonated diamine (e.g. 3 mM/liter) tothe alkaline 1,6-hexanendiamine solution, and then the standardprocedure for preparation of nylon membrane articial cells asdescribed in Appendix II can be used.The reaction is shown in Fig. 5.6.April 13, 1995 Articial Regenerative... 102 Articial Cells Fig. 5.6. Upper : schematic representation of nylon articial cell membrane. Lower : schematic representation of sulfonic nylon articial cell membrane (Chang, 1965, 1972a). Sulfonated nylon membrane articial cells prepared as described in the foregoing have a negative surface charge compared to that of rbc's. Although sulfonated nylon articial cells are also removed rapidly, they survived in the circulation signicantly longer than nylon membranearticial cells (Fig. 5.7). In addition, the sulfonated nylon membranearticial cells are less liable to be trapped in the pulmonary circulationand the reticuloendothelial system compared with nylon membranearticial rbc's. Polysaccharide incorporation Since natural rbc's and the endothelium of vessels are coveredby mucopolysacchride, further experiments were carried out toincorporate a complex containing a mucopolysaccharide (heparin)into the collodion membrane of articial cells (Chang et al. , 1967; Chang, 1970). Preliminary results showed that while both types wereremoved rapidly from the circulation, those with a heparin-complexedmembrane survived longer.April 13, Nanotechnology-based Articial Red Blood Cells 103 Fig. 5.7.

Summary The in vitro results showed that articial rbc's with the required in vitro properties to substitute rbc's can be prepared. However, the single major problem is the extremely short circulation time of theartical rbc's. We found that they have to be less than 1 micronin diameter to avoid being trapped in the lung capillaries (Chang,1965, 1972a). Even then, they are removed by the reticuloendothelialsystem. We attempted to look at why the rbc's circulated for solong, by using neuraminidase to remove sialic acid from the redblood cell membrane. We showed that the removal of sialic acidresulted in the rapid removal of the rbc's from the circulation (Chang1965, 1972a, Chang & MacIntosh, 1964a) (Fig. 5.5). This observationled us to prepare articial Regenerative... ch05 FA 104 Articial Cells This included the use of other synthetic polymers and cross-linked protein membranes (Chang 1965, 1972a); membrane with negativesurface charge and polysaccharide surface as sialic acid analogues(Chang et al., 1976, and lipid-protein and lipid-polymer membranes (Chang 1969d, 1972a). Some of these improved thecirculation time. However, the circulation time was still not sufcientlylong for practical applications. 5.4. Submicron Lipid Membrane Articial RBCs We prepared larger lipid membrane articial cells where the lipid is supported in the form of lipid-protein membrane and lipid-polymer membrane (Chang 1969d, 1972a). In 1980 Djordjevichand Miller reported that they could prepare submicron 0.2 micron-diameter articial rbc's using lipid membrane vesicles to encapsulatehemoglobin (Fig. 5.8). This increased the circulation time signicantly,although it was still rather short. Many investigators have since carriedout research to improve the preparation and the circulation time.Examples of the many Improvements include modications of surface properties such as surface charge, and the useof sialic acid analogues. The most successful approach to improve thecirculation time is to incorporate polyethylene-glycol (PEG) into thelipid membrane articial rbc's (Fig. 5.8), resulting in a circulation half-time of more than 30 h (Philips et al. , 1999). Rudolph's group has carried out a very extensive study that has contributed much to this area (Rudolph, 1994, 1995, Rudolph et al. , 1997). Tsuchida's group has for many years carried out research anddevelopment leading to commercial development and preclinicalanimal studies in preparation for clinical trials (Tsuchida, 1994, 1998; Tsuchida et al. , 1988, 1992). In North America, lipid membrane articial red blood cell's are called lipid encapsulated hemoglobin(LEH). In Japan, they called hemoglobin vesicles (HbV). Lipid encapsulated hemoglobin (LEH) is a very large area that will be best left for later book volumes of our book series \"RegenerativeMedicine, Artical Cells and Nanomedicine\" This way, Red Blood Cells 105 Fig. 5.8. Left: Bilayer lipid membrane that forms the membrane of lipid encapsulated hemoglobin (lipid membrane articial rbc's). Right : Incorporation of polyethylene-glycol (PEG) to the lipid membrane resultedin marked improvement in the circulation time of hemoglobin PEG-lipidvesicles (PEG-lipid membrane articial rbc's). in a special area can present in detail his or her own specialized area. Furthermore, there will not be any copyright infringement by the authorof this monograph. The following is a brief overview of LEH. Composition and preparation LEH lipid membrane consists of cholesterol and phospholipids. Oneof the aims is to increase the encapsulation efciency of hemoglobinwithin a minimal amount of lipid. This can be done by usinganionic lipids. Furthermore, inclusion of anionic lipid signicantlyincreases the circulcation (Awasthi et al. , 2004). However, some anionic liposomes may interact adversely in vivo with the complement (Szebeni, 1998). On the other hand, it is important to remember thatthe same type of lipid produced by different manufacturers may havedifferent abilities in terms of activating the complement (Chang andLister, 1990). This further supports the view that there is a need to usethe C3a screening test for each lipid before its use in preparing LEH(Chang and Lister, 1990). The use of a new synthetic anionic lipid,1,5-diplamitoyl-l-glutamate-N-succinic acid may solve the problemof complement activation (Sou al. , 2003).April 13, 106 Articial Cells Tsuchida's group has been scaling up the production of PEG-LEH for preclinical and clinical studies. Briefly, they carried out pasteurizationat 60 C for 10 h to achieve viral inactivation. The conversion of hemoglobin to carbonylhemoglobin (HbCO) increases the stabilityof hemoglobin during pasteurization. During pasteurization, all theother proteins including red blood cell enzymes are denatured andprecipitated, resulting in a pure Hb solution. This also removes thered blood cell enzymes that prevent metHb formation, for instancemethemoglobin reductase system and catalase. Thus, they tried toco-encapsulate glutathione of homocysteine andcatalase with the by co-encapsulating allosteric effectors. After pasteurization,the Hb solution is passed through a series of ultraltrators to removeany virus, and then concentrated by ultraltration to 40g/liter. Afteradjustment for electrolytes, this is then encapsulated the PEG-LEH. HbCO is then covereted back to oxyHb by illuminating theLEH with a visible light under O 2The group was able to use the extrusion method to prepare PEG-LEH at a pH of 7.0-7.4. Their mixedlipids contained dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) as the maincomponent. Using number of progressing steps of extrusion, theynally obtained PEG-LEH with a diameter of 250 \u00b120 nm with a Hb/lipid ratio of 1.7-1.8. The Hb inside PEG-LEH, like the red blood cell Hb, does not exert a colloid osmotic pressure. Thus, human serum albumin, hydroxyethly starch or dextran has to be added to the suspending solution. They chose to use recombinant human albumin since there is no immunological problem and infective agents are absent. For purpose ofstorage, they use LEH with PEG on the surface to prevent aggregationand deoxygenate the hemoglobin to prevent metHb formation. Thegroup reported that their PEG-LEH can be stored at 4 C and 23C for 2 years. PEH-LEH stored at 40C became unstable after one year. Methemoglobin Reducing agents and glucose cannot cross the LEH lipid membrane. Thus, reducing agents from the plasma cannot cross the PEG-LipidApril 13, 1995 10:54 SPI-B446 Nanotechnology-based Articial Red Blood Cells 107 membrane to reduce the formation of methemoglobin. Furthermore, all the red blood cell enzymes are removed during the pasteurizationprocedure. Even if the methemoglobin reductase system can be added,it will require glucose as a substrate to recycle the cofactors needed inthe enzymatic conversion of methemoglobin back to hemoglobin. As aresult, hemoglobin in LEH is slowly converted to methemoglobin afterinfusion at body temperature. Increase in circulation time would notserve any useful purpose if the enclosed hemoglobin is converted tomethemoglobin in long circulating PEG-LEH. As a result, many studieshas have been carried out especially byTsuchida's group to resolve thisproblem. As mentioned above, Tsuchida's group added antioxidantslike glutathione or homocysteine and catalase to hemoglobin beforethe latter is encapsulated into the PEG-LEH. To slow down metHbformation during storage, the LEH can be deoxygenated by perfusingit with nitrogen gas and storing it at 4 C. 5.5. LEH in Animal Studies Circulation time after infusion As discussed under polymeric membrane articial rbc's above, size is very important as far as circulation time is concerned. LEH largerthat 200 nm are removed rapidly. Those under 200 nm are less likelyto be removed by the reticuloendothelial system. However, those ofabout 60 nm are removed quickly by the liver, most likely through thefenestrated hepatic endothelium (Liu et al. , 1992). Thus, up to a point, a smaller size is important in maintaining LEH in the circulation. However, decreasing the size of LEH would alsodecrease the encapsulation efciency of hemoglobin. In this regard,Philips et al's (1999) study showing that PEG-lipid membrane articial rbc's can have a markedly increased circulation time is very important. The use of PEG-lipid membrane will allow for the use of larger LEH, with a better efciency for encapsulating hemoglobin. Thus, a sizerange of 210-275 nm is possible with PEG-lipid membranes sincethese still maintain a good circulation time (Awasthi et al. , 2003). Larger than this and the LEH would be removed rapidly. InsertingApril 13, 1995 10:54 SPI-B446 Articial Cells PEG-linked phosphatidylethanolamines (PEG-PE) into the outer layer of LEH, will, improve the encapsulation efciency of hemoglobin andthe circulation time (Awasthi et al., 2003). Thus, PEG-LEH infused into rats shows a circulation half-time of 30 h. Most of the LEH are removedby the reticuloendothelial system (RES), liver and spleen. Compared tohumans, rats have a highly active RES; thus, it has been suggested thataT 1/2of 12-20 h in rats is equivalent to 40-60 h in humans (Woodle et al. , 1995). Similar results were obtained with PEG-lipid membrane articial rbc's prepared byTsuchida's group (Saiki et al., 2001; Sou et al., 2005). Their study using radioisotope-labeling showed that the circulation half-life was 32 h in rats with a dose of 14 ml/kg (Sou et al. , 2005). Gamma camera imaging showed that they were removed mainly bythe liver, spleen and bone marrow.They were found in the phagosomesof the macrophages one day after infusion (Sakai et al. , 2001), but cannot be observed after seven days. Safety of lipid membrane articial rbc's As mentioned earlier, Tsuchida's group at Waseda University is developing their PEG-lipid membrane articial cells for commercialscale up in preclinical animal studies towards clinical trial. They havecollaborated with Kobayashi at Keio University to carry out detailedsafety and efcacy studies in animal (Kobayashi et al. , 1997, Izumi et al. , 1997; Yushizi et al. , 2004). The following is a summary of their results. For copyright reasons, many of the excellent gures could not be included in this monograph, butare available in the referred papers. In their study, HbV (LEH) were suspended in 5 g/dl human serum albumin. The resulting colloid osmotic pressure was 20 mmHg and theviscosity, 3 cP, both similar to whole blood. They studied the effectsof daily repeated infusion of HbV by following serum biochemistry(Sakai et al., 2004a, Sakai et al., 2004b, Saikai et al., 2004d). Indicators of liver function like albumin, ALT, AST and LDH stayed within thenormal ranges. Bilirubin and ferric ion remained at a low TheApril 13, 1995 SPI-B446 Nanotechnology-based Articial Red Blood Cells 109 lipid concentration increased, but returned to its original level in 2 wk, indicating that the lipid component of the HbV were metabolized inthe body. They found that infusion of these 250 nm diameter PEG-lipid membrane articial cells did not result in any vasopressor effects. This lends further support to the hypothesis that vasopressor effects is due to single tetrameric Hb crossing the intercellular junction of theendothelial cell lining of blood vessels. Efcacy in exchange transfusion, hemorrhagic shock and hemodilution The group carried out exchange transfusion of 90% of the blood volume in rats and studied oxygen transport by inserting needleoxygen electrodes into their renal cortex and skeletal muscle. Whenalbumin alone was used for the 90% exchange, there was a markeddecrease in both the arterial blood pressure and renal cortical oxygentension followed by the death of the rats. On the other hand, allthe rats survived when the 90% exchange transfusion was carriedout using their articial lipid membrane articial rbc's suspended inhuman serum albumin. Both the arterial blood pressure and renalcortical oxygen tension remained unchanged. They also studied theuse of recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA) instead of humanserum to suspend the HbV. HbV suspended in this waywas found to be safe and effective as priming volumes for 50%hemodilution in cardiopulmonary bypass. All the rats survived withcontinuing growth as shown by body weight gains. The group reportedno irreversible changes in plasma biochemistry, hematology andhistopathology. They also studied the use of rat HbV for resuscitation in hemorrhagic shock in rats (Sakai et al., 2004c; Yoshizu et al., 2004). In anesthetized rats, removing 50% of the total blood volume resulted in hypotensionand metabolic acidosis. Infusion of either HbV in rHSA or autologousrbc's in rHSAA restored the blood pressure. However, rHSA alone withHbV did not restore the artierial blood pressure and some of the ratsin this group died.April 13, 1995 Regenerative... ch05 FA 110 Articial Cells Summary The single major obstacle to the practical realization of the original articial rbc's (Chang, 1957, 1964, 1972a) was the low circulationtime. With extensive research by many groups, the use of PEG-lipidmembrane to form 250 nm-diameter PEG-lipid membrane articialrbc's has increased the circulation time to a clinically useful level. Thisis an important and major step in the development towards a morecomplete articial rbc for clinical use. 5.6. Nanodimension Biodegradable Polymeric Membrane RBCs Introduction Submicron PEG-lipid membrane articial rbc's as described above, have solved the major barrier of short circulation time. The lipidencapsulated hemoglobin (LEH) has potential uses in a number ofclinical conditions. However, in some other clinical conditions onemay have to look at the effect of the lipid membrane of the LEHespecially regarding the following two aspects. (1) The smaller the particle, the larger will be the total surface area in the same volume of suspension. Thus, a 1 ml suspension of 200 nm-diameter LEH would have more than 10 times the total surfacearea of a 1 ml suspension of rbc's. Since both have a bilayer lipidmembrane, the total amount of lipid would, at least be 10 timeshigher for the 1 ml suspension of 200 nm lipid membrane articialrbc's compared to rbc's. A large amount of lipid can decreasethe phagocytic function of the reticuloendothelial systems (RES).In traumatic hemorrhagic shock, the RES needs to be efcient inremoving contaminating microorganisms. Furthermore, in ischemicreperfusion, lipid may induce lipid peroxidation. Therefore, we arecarrying out a study to see if we can cut down as much as possiblethe amount of lipid needed for the membrane of nano articialrbc's.April 13, 1995 Nanotechnology-based Articial Red Blood Cells 111 (2) Another problem is methemoglobin formation. For example, reducing agents present in the plasma of the circulating blood canreduce the rate of methb formation in polyHb or conjugated Hb.However, these reducing agents cannot cross the lipid membrane ofLEH. Glucose that is needed for the methemoglobin reductase systeminside red blood cell's also cannot cross the lipid membrane of LEG. Thus, research to nd a way to prevent metHb formation in long circulating LEH is an ongoing process. For biodegradable membrane nano articial rbc's, we can use membranes that are permeable toreducing agents and small molecules like glucose. Nanodimension biodegradable polymeric membrane articial rbc's Our aim is, therefore, to study how to prepare nanodimension articial rbc's with the following properties: 1. Contains little or no lipid in the membrane. 2. Persist in the circulation after infusion for a sufciently long time.3. Be stable in storage.4. Remains stable after infusion for the duration of its function as a blood substitute \u2014 but it has to be biodegraded soon after thecompletion of its action in the body. 5. The membrane material and its degradation products have to be nontoxic. 6. In addition to hemoglobin, the nano articial cells should contain important rbc enzymes like catalase,carbonic anhydrase and methemoglobin reductase, as shown inFig. 5.1. 7. The membrane should be permeable to reducing agents and/or glucose. We have been using biodegradable polymer, e.g. polylactic acid, to prepare micron dimension articial cells for the encapsulation ofhemoglobin, enzymes and other biologically active material since1976 (Chang, 1976a). With the availability of methods to preparearticial cells of nanometer dimensions, we started to prepareApril 13, Articial Cells hemoglobin nanocapsules of less than 0.2 micron mean diameter using polylactic acid (PLA) membrane, PEG-PLA membrane and otherbiodegradable polymers (Chang & WPYu, al. , 2003a, 2003b; WPYu & Chang, 1994, 1996). Safety and reasons for selection of polylesters as the biodegradable polymer membrane Polymers for forming nano articial rbc membrane have to be non- toxic and can be degraded in the body into nontoxic degradationproducts. Polyesters like polylactic are normal human metabolites. The rateof degradation can be adjusted by variations in the molecularweight, particle size and ratios of the copolymer. Other potentiallyuseful biodegradable polyesters include Poly(hydroxybutyric acid)and its copolymer with hydroxyvalerianic polyorthoesters,polyanhydrides and others. Potential toxicity can come fromresidue monomers and chemicals used in polymerization to formnanocapsules. The solvent evaporation method (Chang, 1976a) forpreparing polylactide membrane articial cells and microspheres is the original method for preparing articial rbc's (Chang,1957). This method obviates the need for monomers or chemicalreagents and nontoxic solvents can be used. Since 1982, there has been extensive clinical experience gained in the use of polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid and polylactoglycolides inhumans as surgical sutures or implants with no adverse or toxic effects. The amounts used are many folds greater that needed for the ultrathin membrane of the nano articial rbc's. Polyglycolic acid (Dexon-S)suture has been used routinely in surgical practice since 1982 with noreported toxicities. Meadows et al. (1993) show that grafting polylactic acid (PLA) granules is as successful as using decalcied freeze-driedbone allograft. There is no reported toxicity in many other surgicalimplantations of polylactide or polyglycolide in amounts many foldsgreater than what we plan to use for nano articial red blood cellmembrane. The basic approach of articialApril 13, Red Blood Cells 113 cells or microspheres (Chang, 1976a) for drug devliery has been used clinically. For example, Jaquel et al. (1995) gave repeated injections of Poly(DL-lactate-coglycolide) microspheres containing Octreotide in100 acromegalic patients. As mentioned above, long term experiences in humans show that the polyesters and their degradation products are safe. We alsohave long term experience in research on biodegradable polymermicroencapsulation using polylactides, having initiated this area in1976 (Chang, 1976a). Thus, we decided to look into the use ofpolylactic acid as the biodegradable membrane for nano articial rbc's.Details of the method of preparation will be described later. 5.7. Characterization of Nano Articial RBCs Electromicroscopic appearance A Philips EM300 electron microscope, at 60 KV, was used. The sample was treated by standard negative staining. A typical electronmicrograph for the biodegradable polymer hemoglobin nanocapsulesprepared with d,l-PLA is shown in Fig. 5.9. They are sphericaland homogeneous. Their diameter in the micrograph ranges from40-120 nm, with a mean diameter of 80 nm. The membrane thicknessis 5-15 nm. Size distribution of polylactide membrane articial rbc's The diameter and size distribution of the biodegradable hemoglobin are determined by using the Nicomp Size Analyzer (Model 370). The instrument operates by light scattering. The average particle size of the biodegradable nanocapsules containing hemoglobin isdependent on the formula used for preparation. A typical sizedetermined using the Nicomp Sizer Analyzer is presented in Fig. 5.10. A unimodal distribution is obtained for all the samples. With different preparation processes and different polymers, the mean diameters ofthe biodegradable hemoglobin nanocapsules can be shown to be aslow as 74 nanometers.April 13, 1995 of polylactide membrane articial rbc's. Mean diameter is 80 nanometer (from WPYu & Chang, 1996). Fig. 5.10. Size distribution of PLA nano articial rbc's determined Nicomp SizeAnalyzer (Model 370).An unimodal distribution is obtained.Themean diameter for this sample is about 100 nm. (From WPYu & Chang, 1996). Other properties The characteristics of the preparation containing 10.97 gm/dl of hemoglobin prepared with d,l-PLA is listed inTable 5.1. Nanocapsulescan be prepared with up to 15 gm/dl concentration.April 13, 1995 Nanotechnology-based Articial Red Blood Cells 115 Table 5.1 Characteristics Hemoglobin concentration: 10.97 g/dl (up to cp) Shear Rat (1/sec) Viscosity of 6.5 90 6.5 225 5.0 Steady shear viscosity determination Steady shear viscosity of the suspension of measured with a Wells-Brookeld with a 0.80 cone (Model Shear rates were from 45 to 450 s1at 22C. The steady shear viscosity of the biodegradable polymer hemoglobin nanocapsules is shown in Table 5.2. 5.8. Safety and Efcacy of Nano Articial RBCs Amount and fate of PLA membrane By assuming that all the polymer used in the solvent evaporationmethod is incorporated into the nano articial red blood cellmembrane, the maximal amount of polymer per 500 ml of suspensionof nano articial rbc's is shown in Fig. 5.11. The total amount ofmembrane material is much less that the total membrane material inLEH. Furthermore, the membrane material of PLA nano articial rbc'sas shown in Fig. 5.11 is made up mostly of biodegradable polymerwith a minimal amount of lipid. Since polymer is stronger than lipidand is also porous, much less membrane material is required.April 13, 1995 10:54 SPI-B446 Articial 116 Articial Cells Fig. 5.11. Top: Amount of membrane material in LEH and PLA nano rbc's, 2nd from top : Fate of polylactide membrane in PLA nano rbc's compard to PLA metabolism. 3rd from top : Hb concentration reported. Bottom : Oxygen dissociation curve of PLA nano rbc's compared to SF Articial Red Blood Cells 117 Polylactic acid is degraded in the body into lactic acid and then to carbon dioxide (Fig. 5.11). These are all normal body metabolites.However, in hemorrhagic shock much lactic acid can be produced. Therefore, it is important to analyze how much lactic acid is produced in the degradation of PLA nano articial rbc's. Polylactide is degradedinto lactic acid and then water and carbon dioxide (Fig. 5.11). Fora 500 ml suspension of PLA nano articial rbc's, the total lactic acidproduced is 83 mEq. This is far less than the normal resting body lacticacid production of 1000-1400 mEq/day) (Fig. 5.11).The 7080 Thus, 83 mEq isequal to about 1 to 2% of this. Furthermore, polylactic acid in thePLA nano articial rbc's is biodegraded over at least two days, andtherefore, there is an even smaller amount released per day for eachunit of PLA nano articial rbc. Efciency in nanoencapsulating hemoglobin At present, the hemoglobin nanoencapsulation efciencies range from 13 to 29% of the starting quantities of hemoglobin, depending onthe polymer used. A higher amount of hemoglobin is encapsulatedwith poly(D.L.)lactic acid. Nano articial rbc's prepared withpoly(D.L.)lactic acid contained fewer defects in the membrane thanthat prepared using poly(L)lactic acid. The ratio of hemoglobin:phospholipid : polymer for the preparation with hemoglobin of10.97 gm/dl suspension is 15 : 1 : 2. Higher Hb concentration ofup to 15 gm/dl suspension has also been prepared more recently(Fig. 5.11). This approaches the hemoglobin concentration in wholeblood. Oxygen afnity, Hill coefcient and Bohr effect We use the TCS Hemoxanalyser (TCS Medical Products Co., U.S.A.) to measure oxygen afnity. The result for PLA articial rbc's with10.97 gm/dl hemoglobin, is shown in Fig. 5.11. There is no signicantdifference between hemoglobin nano articial rbc's and the originalbovine hemoglobin used for the preparation. Hill coefcient is 2.4 toApril 13, 1995 Regenerative... ch05 FA 118 Articial Cells Fig. 5.12. Effects of pH on oxygen afnity of PLA nano articial rbc's. (From WPYu & Chang, 1996.) 2.9.These results show that the procedure of preparation does not have adverse effects on the hemoglobin molecules. In the physiological pHrange, oxygen afnity of PLA nano articial rbc's changes with pH(Fig. 5.12) and the Bohr effect is 0.22 to 0.24. Enzymes and multienzymes We have earlier carried out basic research on articial cells containing multienzyme systems with cofactor recycling (Chang, 1987b). Anumber of enzymes present in rbc's have been encapsulatedwithin nano articial rbc's activities , 2003a, 2003b). For example, we have encapsulated the red blood cell methemoglobin reductase system into the nano articialrbc's (Chang et al. , 2003a, 2003b) and showed that this can convert methemoglobin to hemoglobin. For PLA nano articial rbc's, themembrane can be made permeable to glucose and other smallmolecules. This allows us to prepare Red Blood Cells 119 the methemoglobin reductase system to function as shown in Fig. 5.1. External glucose can diffuse into the nano articial rbc's. Productsof the reaction can diffuse out and therefore do not accumulate inthe nano articial rbc's to inhibit the reaction. Furthermore, reducingagents from the outside can enter the nano articial cells to help inpreventing metHb rbc's containing metHb reductase system By increasing the circulation time, we can increase the in vivo functioning of the hemoglobin in the nano articial rbc's. However,with the increase in circulation in the body at 37 C, there would be a steady increase in methemoglobin. Oxidation of hemoglobin tomethemoglobin inside rbc's is prevented by the enzyme systems of thered blood cell (rbc). PLA nano articial rbc's can contain all the enzymes of the red blood cell (Fig. 5.1). This is done by extracting from red bloodcell all the enzymes and hemoglobin. In preparing nano articialrbc's, there is usually an increase in the metH level (Fig. 5.13). After this, when suspended in Ringer lactate at body temperature, metHb rose rapidly (Fig. 5.13). With the addition of 100 mg/dlglucose and 0.02 mM NADH, instead of increasing, metHb leveldecreased with time. This preliminary result is exciting becauseit shows that we only need to encapsulate fresh red blood cellcontents with the normal amount of methemoglobin reductase system.In this way, 100 mg glucose (can be available as blood glucose)and 0.02 mM NADH in a suspending medium not only preventmetHb formation, but can convert preformed metHb back to Hb. Through further optimization of the NADH concentration, this can be increased further. Unlike NADH, the larger cofactor NADPHis not permeable across the nanocapsules. Since NADPH is notpermeable, it can be enclosed inside the PLA nano articial rbc's forrecycling. This would obviate the need to supply external cofactorand only a continuous supply of glucose from the circulating blood isneeded.April 13, 1995 10:54 SPI-B446 Articial Regenerative... ch05 120 Articial Cells 0 2 4 20 10 0Control 10 mM ascorbic acid 0.1% glucose + 0.02mM NADH Time (hours)MetHb %Nano 37oC 5.13. Nanoencapsulation increases MetHb level. After this when incubated at 37C metHb increases quickly. Addition of a reducing agent, ascorbic acid prevents the increase in MetHb. Addition of glucose and NADHdecreases MetHb further. Nano articial rbc's permeable to reducing factors There are reducing agents in the plasma that prevent methemoglobin formation. Examples include ascorbic acid and glutathione. Thesecan cross the membrane of the PLA nano articial rbc's. In ourstudy, we nd that ascorbic acid, bluecan the membrane of PLA nano articial rbc's. When nanoarticial red blood cell is suspended in Ringer lactate with a10 mM concentration of ascorbic acid, there is no increase inmetHb as long as there is enough supply of ascorbic acid. (Fig.5.13). Thus, it would appear that Hb in the nano articial rbc'scould be exposed to reducing factors in the circulating plasmathat prevent the formation of metHb. This is an additional andsimpler means of preventing the oxidation of hemoglobin intomethemoglobin.April 13, Articial Red Blood 121 Enzymes and multienzymes in PLA nano articial rbc's Other red blood cell enzymes present in the red blood cell extract, like carbonic anhydrase, catalase and superoxide dismutase are alsoincluded articial rbc's (Fig. 5.1). In addition, higherconcentrations of red blood cell enzymes like catalase and superoxidedismutase can be included. Other non-red blood cell enzymes can alsobe included. 5.9. Circulation Time of Nano Articial RBCs Circulation half-life of PLA articial rbc's The in vitro results obtained so far appear promising and encourage us to continue to carried out detailed in vivo studies. We started with studying the circulation time. Circulation half-life of PLA nano articialrbc's is evaluated in anesthetized male rats. Each rat received 1/3 ofits blood volume via intravenous top loading. PLA articial red bloodcell is removed very rapidly from the circulation. As a result, we investigated different ways of changing the surface properties of the PLA nano articial rbc's as described below. Thisincludes different ways of incorporating PEG into the PLA membrane. Different types of PEG-PLA copolymers for nano articial rbc's Figure 5.15 summarizes the results of the circulation time in rats for polyHb and different types of PLA and PEG-PLA et al., 2003b). PLA nano are removed very rapidly from the circulation. PolyHb circulates with the same half-time as thatnormally obtained in rats. Depending on the method used, PEG-PLAnano articial rbc's (Fig. 5.14) have signicantly higher circulation timethan PolyHb. The details are as follows. Anesthetized rats received a 30% blood volume toploading by intravenous infusion. Figure 5.15 gm/dl) in maximal non-redblood cell Hb concentration of 3.35 gm/dl, falling maximalApril 13, 1995 membrane RBC's Fig. forms the membrane of nano articial rbc's. Right : Incorporation of polyethylene-glycol (PEG) in the PLA membrane results in marked improvement of circulation time of PEG-PLA membranenano articial rbc's. concentration of 1.67 gm/dl in 14 h. From here on, PolyHb (17:1) is used as the basis for comparison with all nano articial rbcpreparations. Four factors, individually or in combination, should be considered when preparing the different types of PEG-PLA nano articial rbc's. These are studied in regard to the maximal systemic Hb attained and the time of maintaining a systemic non-red blood cell Hb levelequal to that of polyHb (17:1), 1.67 gm/dl. The four factors are asfollows. (i) Use of different degrees of polymerized Hb. (ii) Effects of higher M.W. PLA. (iii) Effects of concentrations of the PEG-PLA copolymer. (iv) Crosslinking of the newly formed PEG-PLA Hb nanocapsules. (1)Effects of molecular weight PEG-PLA nano Articial Red Blood Cells 123 Fig. 5.15. Comparison of the maximal systemic non-rbc hemoglobin reached after infusion of different preparations and the time to reached agiven non-rbc hemoglobin level. The time for PolyHb-17 to reach a non-rbc hemoglobin level of 1.67 gm/dl is 14 hours in rats equivalent to 24 hours inhuman. The time for different types of nano articial red blood cells to reachthis non-RBC hemoglobin concentration is used to calculate the equivalenttime for human (Chang et al. , 2003b). The non-red blood cell Hb falls to 1.67 gm/dl in 12.3 h (Fig. 5.15). Calculations based on body weight, blood volume, plasma volume anddilution factors show that the maximal non-red blood cell hemoglobinconcentration nano articial rbc's should been 3.6 gm/dl. Thisseems to show that a signicant part (about 16%) has been removednearly immediately on infusion. We then used a more rened method to improve the degree of polymerization to markedly reduce the amount of tetramerichemoglobin (PolyHb 17:1). This was then used for preparing PEG-PLA articial rbc's. Two \u00b10.04 S.D. the gm/dl (S.D. =0.04) above. This also approached the maximal possible initial non-red blood cell Hb concentration. Furthermore,it took 17.1 h in rats for the non-red blood cell Hb level to fallApril 13, Articial Cells to 1.67 gm/dl. The next step was to further improve this in the following step-wise incremental design until we reached a maximalconcentration of 3.66 \u00b10.03 S.D. gm/dl and 24.2 h to fall to the level of 1.67 gm/dl in rats. (2)Effects of higher concentration of PEG-PLA copolymer combined with polyHb (17:1) The same method as above with PolyHb (17:1) used, but with a 1.5 times higher PEG-PLA concentration. This resulted in a thickermembrane with better membrane stability, which in turn resultedin a further increase in circulation time (Fig. 5.15). Thus, in twomin after infusion, the maximal non-red blood cell Hb was 3.60 \u00b1 0.01 S.D. gm/dl. Furthermore, it took 20.0 h in rats for the non-redblood cell Hb level to fall to the level of 1.67 gm/dl. We also usedtwice the concentration of PEG-PLA polymer to further improve thestability of the membrane. However, the Hb nanocapsules formedthis way tended to aggregate and therefore was not tested in animalstudies. (3)Effects of higher molecular weight PLA for the PEG-PLA copolymer We looked at the use of a higher molecular weight PLA to increase the stability. For this we replaced the 5K PLA in (1) above with a 15KPLA to form the PEG-PLA copolymer. This signicantly increases thecirculation time of the preparation as compared to method (1).Thus, intwo min after infusion, the 3.57 \u00b1 0.05 S.D. The slope of the disappearance was also much moregradual, but what is more important is that it took 21.2 h in rats for thenon-red blood cell Hb level to fall to 1.67 gm/dl. (4)Higher PEG-PLA concentration combined with higher molecular weight PLA We next looked at combining the use of a higher molecular weight PLA (15K) as in (3) above with a 1.5 times higher concentration ofApril 13, 1995 10:54 SPI-B446 Nanotechnology-based Articial Red Blood Cells 125 the polymer as in (2) above. This is a combination of the following 3 factors: (a) Using polyhemoglobin with low percentage of crosslinked tetrameric hemoglobin. (b) Using a 1.5 x concentration of the PLA-co-PEG copolymer. (c) Using a higher molecular weight PLA (15K). This resulted in a further signicant improvement. In 2 min after infusion, the maximal non-red blood cell Hb was: 3.6458 \u00b1 0.02 gm/dl. The slope of the disappearance was also much moregradual, and it took 23.3 h for the non-red blood cell Hb level to fallto the level of 1.67 gm/dl (Fig. 3). (5)Effect of crosslinking the newly formed Hb nanocapsules The method described in (1) above using polyHb (17:1) was modied by adding glutaraldehyde to the newly form PEG-PLA nano articialcells. This approach has been used earlier to stabilize both thelarger Hb microcapsules and the protein inside (Chang, 1971b). Thepolymerization was stopped by adding 2 M of lysine (at molar ratio oflysine/hemoglobin =100:1) after 24 h. This approach also increased the circulation time to the same degree as when using 1.5 timesconcentration of the polymer in (2) above.Thus, in 2 min after infusion,the maximal was higher: 3.60 \u00b10.01 S.D. gm/dl. The slope of the disappearance was also much more gradual, but what is more important is that it took 20.3 h in rats for the non-red bloodcell Hb level to fall to 1.67 gm/dl (Fig. 5.15). (6)Effects of the combination of all four factors to prepare Hb nanocapsules Finally, we combined all the above four factors as follows: (a) Using the polyhemoglobin (17:1) with a low percentage of single crosslinked tetrameric hemoglobin. (b) Using a 1.5 x concentration of the PLA-co-PEG copolymer. (c) Using a higher molecular weight PLA (15K).April 13, 1995 10:54 SPI-B446 Articial Cells (d) Crosslinking of the newly formed Hb nanocapsules with glutaraldehyde. In 2 min after infusion, the maximal non-red blood cell Hb was higher at 3.6583 \u00b10.03 S.D. gm/dl (Fig. 5.15).The slope of the disappearance was also gentler and it took 24.2 h in rats for the non-red blood cellHb level to fall to 1.67 gm/dl. Analysis of results All the results obtained are summarized in Fig. 5.15. and Table 5.3. After a 30% blood volume toploading using polyHb (10 gm/dl), the best can only Hb 3.35 best PEG-PLA articial on theother hand, can reach a maximal Hb concentration of 3.60 gm/dl. This cannot be explained by polyHb having more colloid osmotic pressure than Hb inside the nanocapsules and resulting in somehemodilution. After all, in those PEG-PLA Hb nanocapsules Hb reached for nanocap-10-1-5K is lower than that forPolyHb-17. The more likely explanation is that for the best PEG-PLAHb nanocapsules, they all remain in the circulation when the rstsamples are taken at 2 min after infusion. For nanocap-10-1-5K andPolyHb, a small fraction must have been removed within 2 min afterinfusion. Table 5.3 Analysis of Results Preparation Max Hb Time to 1.67g/dl (h) PolyHb-10 3.10 gm/dl 10.4 (rats) 17 (humans) PolyHb-17 3.35 gm/dl 14.0 (rats) 24 (humans)Nanocap-10-1-5K 3.05 gm/dl 12.3 (rats) 21 (humans) Nanocap-17-1-5K 3.58 gm/dl 17.1 (rats) 29 (humans) Nanotechnology-based Articial Red Blood Cells 127 Relevance for clinical application in humans After a 30% blood volume toploading, the best polyHb can maintain a systemic hemoglobin level of 1.67 gm/dl for 14 h in rats (equivalent toabout 24 h in humans). In the case of the best PEG-PLA nano articialrbc's a similar toploading can maintain a much longer systemic Hblevel, reaching 1.67 gm/dl after 24.2 h in rats (Fig. 5.15). If one usesthe rat results in this study for polyHb of 14 h and its clinical equivalentof about 24 h, we might calculate and extrapolate this as follows. Forthe best PEG-PLA nano articial rbc's systemic Hb level reaching 1.67 gm/dl after 24.2 h, it is likelyequivalent to about 41.5 h in humans (Fig. 5.15). Compared to humans,rats have a highly active RES; thus, it has been suggested that a T 1/2of 12-20 h in rats is equivalent to 40-60 h in human (Woodle et al., 1995). If this is the case, then the best type of PEG-PLA nano articial rbc'smay have an equivalent circulation time in humans of more than 60 h. This is a signicant and important increase that would allow longer function after infusion and thus decrease the need for donor blood andfurther increase the avoidance of donor blood. A further advantage ofPEG-PLA nano articial rbc's containing polyHb instead of Hb is thateven if PolyHb leaks slowly after infusion it would continue to actand, unlike tetrameric Hb, would not cause adverse effects. Indeed,PEG-PLA nano articial cells could be useful carrier for other modiedHb, including recombinant Hb, PEG conjugated Hb to prolong furthertheir circulation time, inclusion of enzyme systems and avoid directexternal exposure. 5.10. General As discussed in Chapter 4, successes in nanobiotechnology-based polyHb and conjugated Hb stimulate research into the next generationsystems. This is also the case in nanobiotechnology-based articialrbc's. Thus, research in micron dimension articial rbc's has led to thesuccessful development of lipid encapsulated hemoglobin. This hasencouraged us to look into the next step towards a further generationof nano articial rbc's in the form of PEG-PLA nano articial rbc's. We are only at the early stage of this research. In the meantime, itApril 13, 1995 10:54 SPI-B446 Articial Regenerative... ch05 FA 128 Articial Cells is important to complete the development of the lipid encapsulated hemoglobin for clinical trials. 5.11. Method of Preparation of Biodegradable Polymeric Nano Articial RBCs Organic phase Dissolve 100 mg (d.l)-polylactic acid (MW 25000) (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) in 8 ml acetone. Dissolve 50 mg hydrogenated soybean phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) in4 ml ethanol with help of Ultrasonic water bath (very low power). Thetwo solutions are mixed (added either one to another), and used asorganic phase. Aqueous phase Take 0.04 ml of Tween 20, mix with 25 ml 15 g/dl hemoglobin. Preparation of PLA nano articial red blood cells Slowly inject (8 ml/min). (The injection head is made with a 0.2 mlpipette tip). The organic phase integrates into the aqueous phase undermagnetic stirring [with Therm-O-Swirl Stirrer ScienticCo., Chicago) setting to 6)], under 4 C. Nanoparticles are formed immediately, and the suspension is stirred continually for 15 min. Thesuspension prepared comes up to 37 ml. The organic solvent is partly removed from the above suspension prepared by rotary evaporator under vacuum at 20 C for about 10 min. 33 ml of the suspension is obtained (i.e. 4 ml of organic solventremoved). The remaining suspension is mixed with 15 ml of 0.9%NaCl. Then the organic solvent and free hemoglobin are removedby ultraltration (by Amicon ZM 500,000 membrane, MW cut suspension is repeatedly washed by 0.9% NaCl byultraltration. The detailed washing process is as follows: a. The original 33 ml of Hb nanoparticles suspension plus 15 ml 0.9% NaCl, are ml.April 13, Nanotechnology-based Articial Red Blood Cells 129 b. 10 ml of suspension plus 40 ml 0.9% NaCl are concentrated to 6 ml. c. 6 ml suspension plus 18 ml 0.9% NaCl are concentrated to 8 ml. Preparation of PEG-PLA nano articial red blood cells The procedure for the preparation of the new PEG-PLA copolymer is as follows. 1/\u00bdg DL-PLA (M.W. 5000 or 15,000) and 0.75 gmethoxypolyethylene glycol (M.W. 2000 or 5000) are dried undervacuum overnight. 5 ml acetone is added. The mixture is heatedto 180 C for 2 h. under nitrogen. After adding 10 \u00b5l of stannous-2- ethylhexanoate, the mixture is heated at 180C for another 3 h under nitrogen. This is soluble in acetone but not in water. This PEG-PLA is used for the preparation of nano articial cells. The procedure is similar to the procedure for the preparation of PLA nanoarticial rbc's described above, with the following change. 150 mgPEG-PLA copolymer is dissolved in 8 ml acetone. 50 mg hydrogenatedsoybean phosphatidylcholine is dissolved in 4 ml ethanol. The twosolutions are mixed to form the organic phase.April 13, 1995 SPI-B446 Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, 6 Use of Enzyme Articial Cells for Genetic Enzyme Defects thatIncrease Systemic Substratesto Toxic Levels 6.1. Introduction General The basic principle on the use of articial cells containing enzymes in enzyme therapy has been discussed in Chapter 2 (Fig. 2.3). Thisprinciple has been studied for use in enzyme therapy for geneticenzyme defects, removal of unwanted metabolites and treatmentof amino acid-dependent tumors (Fig. 6.1). This chapter describesexamples of the use of enzyme articial cells in three genetic enzymedefects: Acatalasemia, Lesch-Nyhan disease phenylketonuria(Fig. 6.1). Other terminologies for genetic enzyme defects includeinborn errors of metabolism, hereditary enzyme defects and congenitalenzyme deciency. The cause of each of these conditions is thecongenital defects of an enzyme or an enzyme system. This results inthe accumulation of the substrate for the enzyme to an unacceptableor toxic level. Substrate //DEFECTIVE ENZYME //Product The accumulation can be inside the cells as in the case of storage diseases, or throughout the body fluid. There is already an extensiveliterature on inborn errors of metabolism (Scriver, 1989); thus, 13, Enzyme Articial Cells for Genetic Enzyme Defects 131 ENZYME ARTIFICIAL ENZYMESSUBSTRATES PRODUCT ENZYME DEFECTS CELL ARTIFICIAL CELLIMPLANTED: to work with body cells INJECTION BODY FLUID (Blood, plasma etc)PATIENTRetained in chamber outside body Given OrallyExcrete In stoolGiven orally to travel through intestine as microscopic dialysers & bioreactors4 ROUTES OF ADMINISTRATION STUDIED Fig. 6.1. Upper : Examples of enzyme articial cells. Lower : Routes of administration.April 13, Articial Regenerative... ch06 FA 132 Articial Cells chapter will concentrate on the type where the substrates accumulate throughout the body fluids. Enzyme replacement therapy Much study has been carried out on the use of enzyme therapyin treating defective enzymes. However, as discussed in Chapter 2,the use of enzymes directly has a number of problems: a) the enzymemust be able to be located at the site of action; b) the enzyme has to beavailable in a highly puried and non-toxic form; c) the heterogeneousenzyme may result in immunological and hypersensitivity reactions;and d) the enzyme has to act for a sufcient length of time. Some ofthese problems might be avoided by using articial cells containingthe defective enzyme (Chang, 1964, 1965; Chang et al. , 1966; Chang & Poznznsky, 1968) (Fig. 6.1). In this way, the enclosedenzyme does not leak out and become involved in immunologicalor hypersensitivity reactions, but can act on the permeant substrates. We investigated the use of enzyme articial types of and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (Fig. 6.1). Fourroutes of administration were studied (Fig. 6.1) i.e. the enzyme articialcells are: 1) implanted into the body to work alongside the bodycells; 2) retained in chambers outside the body to act on the bodyfluid perfusing the chamber; 3) injected; or 4) given orally so that asthe enzyme articial cells move through the lumen of the intestine,they will act as microscopic bioreactors on the substrates entering theintestinal lumen from the body. In this way, the enzyme articial cellswould not be retained in the body as they would be excreted in thestool after completion of their function. 6.2. Acatalasemia: Congenital Defect in the Enzyme Catalase The rst study is to use the simplest animal model to determine if enzyme therapy using articial cells is feasible, effective and freeApril 13, 1995 Articial Cells: of Enzyme Articial Cells for Genetic Enzyme Defects 133 from immunological effects. Acatalasemia is a congenital defect in the enzyme catalase leading to a deciency in the removal of its substrateperoxide. This is a rare condition in humans, but there is a convenientstrain of mice with congenital defect in the enzyme catalase (Feinsteinet al., 1966).These mice have a blood catalase activity of only 1-2% of normal mice and a total body catalase activity of 20% of normal mice.Furthermore, the enzyme catalase can be obtained easily in a highlypuried form. Our initial study shows that injection of catalase articialcells into acatalasemic mice can effectively remove peroxides (Chang& Poznansky, Nature , 1968b). We therefore carried out further studies to determine the in vivo kinetics, effectiveness and immunological and hypersensitivity effects (Chang, 1971b, 1972f; Poznansky & Chang,1974). The details are as given in the next section. 6.3. Preliminary Study on the Use of Catalase Articial Cells to Replace Defective Catalase in Acatalasemia The rst study is to answer the question \"Can implanted enzyme articial cells work alongside the body cells to replace their enzymedefects?\" (Fig. 6.1). Implantation of catalase articial cells Collodion membrane catalase articial cells were prepared asdescribed in the Appendix under \"Methods of Preparation of ArticialCells.\" In acatalasemic mice which are injected with sodium perboratewithout the protection of a previously injected catalase, the red colorof their pupils turned brown and the animals became increasinglyimmobile, so that by 20 min they became flaccid and were inrespiratory distress. Acatalasemic mice protected by an intraperitonealinjection of catalase articial cells were slightly immobile 5 min afterthe injection of perborate, and the color of their pupils darkened.However, in 10 min, the mice became more active and their pupilsreturned to their normal red color, and except for one animal, theyApril 13, 1995 10:56 SPI-B446 Articial Regenerative... ch06 FA 134 Articial Cells were moving about freely at 20 min. Acatalasemic mice injected with a catalase solution and the normal control mice recovered even faster. Figure 6.2 shows that within 20 min after injection of perborate, normal mice could remove most of the perborate, leaving only2.5% \u00b12.5% S.D. in the body. Acatalasemic mice receiving no catalase injection could only remove a small amount of the injectedperborate, leaving 70% \u00b18.2% S.D. after 20 min. Acatalasemic mice receiving either catalase articial cells or catalase solution, could more efciently remove the injected perborate, leaving respectively,16%\u00b13.5% S.D. and 7% \u00b13.6% S.D. 20 min after injection. Thus, intraperitoneally injected liquid catalase and catalase articial cellsboth acted efciently in replacing the enzyme defect. Catalase insolution is expected to be more efcient since there is no membranebarrier for the diffusion of the substrate. On the other hand, catalase insolution may give rise to immunological and hypersensitivity reactionsand these will be studied in a later section. In the case of catalase ControlControl CatalaseCatalase artificial recovered100 0 % Total body perborate recovered 20 min after injection of perborate. (Chang & Poznansky, Nature , 1968.) Fig. 6.2. Implanted catalase articial cells remove peroxide from the body. They are also effective in removing peroxide from the body when retained in a chamber outside the body and perfused with peritoneal fluid. (Modiedfrom Chang & Enzyme Articial Cells for Genetic Enzyme Defects 135 articial cells, there was no increase in blood catalase level 20 min after injection, showing that there is no leakage of catalase into thesystemic circulation. Catalase articial cells retained in a chamber for body fluid perfusion In the second set of experiment, to avoid the introduction and accumulation of catalase articial cells, especially in long-term use,we carried out the following study. We retained catalase articial cellsin a chamber outside the body and perfused these cells by recirculatingperitoneal fluid from the animal (Fig. 6.1). Here the animals wereanesthetized with Nembutal. Each animal received an intraperitonealinjection of 4.5 ml of inperinol fluid (Abbott Laboratory). This fluid wascontinuously recirculated through a smaller modied version of theextracorporeal shunt chamber (Chang, 1966) for 20 min after injectionof perborate. In one group of animals, the shunt contained 4 ml of a50% suspension of catalase articial cells. In the control group, nocatalase articial cells were present in the shunt. Figure 6.2 shows thatin the control group, the perborate remaining in the body was 76.1% \u00b1 13.4% S.D. after 20 min. In the chamber containing catalase articialcells, only 32% \u00b19.8% S.D. of the injected perborate was recovered 20 min after injection. 6.4. In Vivo Kinetics of Catalase Articial Cells for Acatalasemic Mice enzyme kinetics and immunological properties of collodion articial cells containing catalase (H 202:H202oxidoreductase, EC 1.11.1.6) were studied and compared with catalase in free solution.In vitro studies showed that the K mfor both forms of catalase was 0.55 M. The Vmof the catalase articial cells was 0.5 mM/min, while that of catalase in free solution was 2.5 mM/min. In vivo studies on acatalasemic mice showed that catalase articial cells were as effectiveas the same assayed amount of catalase in free solution in reducing totalApril 13, 1995 10:56 SPI-B446 Articial 136 Articial Cells body substrates. After injection, the catalase activity of the articial cells in the body had a half-time of 4.4 days. This is more stable thancatalase in free solution which had a half-life of 2.0 days after injection.In vitro studies showed that antibody to catalase would not enter the articial cells. Immunizing doses of catalase articial cells did notproduce antibodies. Immunizing doses of catalase solution resulted inthe production of antibodies to catalase. Injection of catalase solutioninto these immunized mice resulted in anaphylactic reactions. On theother hand, catalase articial cells injected into these immunized micecontinued to act without causing any adverse reactions. Methods of preparation of catalase articial cells and experimental procedures These are described in detail in Appendix II. Characteristics of acatalasemic mice Experiments showed that the acatalasemic mice bred in this laboratory from the original Feinstein strain were the same as the original strain. Thus, the blood and total body catalase levels were respectively, 1-2% and 15%, of the normal mice. Kinetics of recovery of injected perborate Figure 6.3 represents the time course of removal of injected perboratefrom acatalasemic mice and from normal mice. Normal mice removedinjected perborate rapidly, whereas acatalasemic mice could onlyremove it at a very slow rate. While the normal mice showed nooutward symptoms after the injection of perborate, the acatalasemicmice were in some distress. The eyes of these acatalasemic micechanged from red to dark brown due to methemoglobin formation,and they became increasingly immobile and by 20 min most of themwere flaccid and in respiratory distress. Quantitative analysis showedthat injection of either catalase solution or catalase articial cells couldsignicantly increase the rate of removal of the injected perborate(Fig. 6.3).

Rate of removal of peroxide in nonimmunized rats using PAL articial cells as compared to catalase solution and control saline. (Modiedfrom Poznansky & Chang, 1974.) either catalase in free solution or catalase articial cells did not suffer any distressful symptoms and were able to remove the peroxide ina manner similar to the normal mice. Thus, both catalase solutionand catalase articial cells were effective and safe after the rstimplantation. 6.5. Immunological Studies on Catalase Articial Cells in Acatalasemic Mice Effects of immunizing doses of catalase solution and catalase articial cells on antibody production The next step is to study whether there is a difference in the immunological response when catalase solution and catalase articialcells, respectively were administered. Acatalasemic mice and rabbitsApril 13, Articial Cells Fig. 6.4. Ouchterlony double-diffusion technique showed that antibodies to catalase were produced in the acatalasemic mice and rabbits immunizedwith catalase in free solution. When catalase articial cells were used, thesame test showed no detectable antibodies. were immunized over a period of 90 days. Each immunizing dose consisted of Freunds' adjuvant with catalase solution or catalasearticial cells (0.1 ml containing 4.8 perborate units of catalase).Ouchterlony double-diffusion technique showed that antibody titerswere produced in the acatalasemic mice and rabbits immunized withcatalase in free solution (Fig. 6.4). The same test showed that nodetectable antibody titers were formed in those animals receivingimmunizing doses of catalase articial cells (Fig. 6.4) Permeability of membrane of collodion articial cells to catalase antibody Catalase antibodies were incubated with catalase articial cells or with control articial cells containing no catalase. No antibodieswere detected inside the articial cells when tests were carried outApril 13, 1995 Articial Cells: of Enzyme Articial Cells for Genetic Enzyme Defects 139 using either the radioactive labeled antibody technique or the micro- complement xation technique. This suggests that the membrane ofarticial cells is not permeable to catalase antibodies. Response of immunized acatalasemic mice to injections of catalase articial cells or catalase solution Intraperitoneal injection of catalase solution into the immunized acatalasemic mice caused them to go into anaphylactic shock and80% of them died within the rst 10 min (Fig. 6.4). Death wasaccompanied by violent gasping, convulsions and collapse similar tothat observed in anaphylactic shock in mice. In the mice that survived,the injected catalase solution was not as effective in removing theperoxide (Fig. 6.5) Injection of catalase articial cells did not produce Fig. 6.5.

(Modied Regenerative... ch06 FA 140 Articial Cells any adverse reactions. In addition, Fig. 6.5 shows that catalase articial cells removed peroxide at the same rate as when the cells were injectedinto the nonimmunized acatalasemic mice (Fig. 6.3). Appearance of catalase activity in the blood after injection of catalase solution or catalase articial cells Intraperitoneally injected catalase solution is expected to move quickly into the blood stream. However, similarly injected catalase articialcells should stay inside the peritoneal cavity where they act on theperborate diffusing into the articial cells. Thus, the enzyme shouldnot leak out of the articial cells into the circulating blood. To analyzethis, the amount of catalase in free solution or of catalase articialcells was reduced to one-third. This reduces the mortality rate from80 to 20% for the immunized mice receiving the catalase solution. Inthis way, the kinetics of removal of the perborate could be studied. The result shows that free catalase solution is not as effective as catalase articial cells in removing the peroxide in immunized mice.Toanalyze the reason for this, the following study was carried out in theseanimals. Figure 6.6 shows the appearance of catalase in the bloodstream of immunized and nonimmunized acatalasemic mice following theintraperitoneal injection of catalase solution or catalase articial cells. There was no detectable leakage of catalase into the blood stream after the intraperitoneal injection of catalase articial cells. There wasno signicant change in the blood catalase level when followed forup to 3 months. The articial cells with its catalase are retained inthe peritoneal cavity after injection. On the other hand, injectionof catalase solution into acatalasemic mice resulted in the rapidappearance of the enzyme in the blood stream. The peak catalaseactivity in the blood reached 182.8 perborate units 8 h after injection ofthe catalase solution into nonimmunized acatalasemic mice (Fig. 6.6). What is surprising is that when the same catalase solution was injected into immunized acatalasemic mice, the blood catalase level reacheda peak of only 19.6 perborate units 4 h after the injection. This is mostlikely due to the formation of antigen-antibody complexes that 13, of Enzyme Articial Cells for Genetic Enzyme Defects 141 Fig. 6.6. Appearance of catalase activity in the circulating blood after intraperitoneal injection of catalase solution or catalase articial cells. After intraperitoneal injection, catalase in solution moves rapidly into the circulation catalase articial cells remains inside the articial cells and doesnot leak into the circulation (From Poznansky & Chang, 1974.) 6.6. Conclusion from Results of Basic Study Using the Acatalasemic Mice Model On a theoretical level, this basic study supports the proposal of using enzyme articial cells to replace the defective enzyme (Fig. 6.1). Thus,articial cells containing an enzyme catalase can effectively replacethe defective catalase enzyme in this animal model. The result alsoshows that catalase inside articial cells is prevented from giving riseto immunological reactions. Furthermore, the membrane of articialcells is not permeable to catalase antibodies in mice previouslyimmunized with catalase solution. Therefore, the catalase articialApril 13, 1995 SPI-B446 Articial Regenerative... ch06 FA 142 Articial Cells cells can continue to function in those acatalasemic mice previously immunized against catalase. Therefore, in theory, enzyme articialcells should allow for enzyme therapy in congenital enzyme defectswhere the accumulation of substrate is in the body fluid. However, at that time, enzymes for the most common genetic enzyme defect, phenylketonuria, could only be extracted from theliver. These liver enzymes are very complex and unstable and notsuitable for use in articial cells for enzyme therapy. With thelater availability of simple and stable enzymes from microorganisms,enzyme therapy becomes much more feasible and practical. However,the major barrier is that enzymes are not stable at body temperatureand thus can only function in the body after injection for a few days.In congenital enzyme defects, the duration of treatment is for the lifeof the patients. Repeated injection of enzyme articial cells over themany years of treatment would result in the accumulation of muchforeign material in the body. To solve this problem, catalase articialcells retained in small chambers outside the body and perfused by bodyfluid can also remove perborate. However, a more convenient routeof administration would be better for pediatric patients. We, therefore,looked at giving enzyme articial cells orally (Fig. 6.1).This is based onour earlier nding of the safety and effectiveness of oral administrationof urease articial cells in rats to remove systemic urea (Chang, 1972a). The safety of oral urease articial cells has later been demonstrated in clinical trials in kidney failure patients (Kjellstrand et al. , 1981). The next two studies will therefore, look at the use of oral administration. This way, the enzyme articial cells move down theintestinal lumen where they act as combined microscopic diaysers andenzyme bioreactors to remove unwanted substrates moving into thelumen from the body fluid. After completion of their functions, they areexcreted in the stool without being accumulated in the body (Fig. 6.1). The enclosed enzymes are protected from intestinal tryptic enzymes. 6.7. Oral Xanthine Oxidase Articial Cells in a Patient with Lesch-Nyhan Disease Lesch-Nyhan disease is caused by a genetic defect in the enzyme hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) of Enzyme Articial Cells for Genetic Enzyme Defects 143 This leads to overproduction of purine and accumulation of oxypurine intermediates and uric acid. It has been suggested that damage to thebrain in Lesch-Nyhan disease may be secondary to the accumulationof oxypurines such as hypoxanthine (Lloyd et al. , 1981). The enzyme HPRT is very complex and difcult to extract on a large scale. However,there is an enzyme, xanthine oxidase, produced by fermentation andcan be easily purchased. We, therefore, look into giving xanthineoxidase (XOD) articial cells orally (Chang, 1989a; Palmour, Changet al. , 1989). As they move through the intestine, the XOD articial cells act as a microscopic combined dialyser-enzyme reactor (Fig. 6.1). The enclosed XOD is protected from tryptic enzymes, but the ultrathin selectively permeable membranes allow passive entry of smallsubstrate molecules like hypoxanthine. Hypoxanthine is highly lipidsoluble, and can therefore equilibrate rapidly between the body fluidand the intestine. In this way, hypoxanthine and other oxypurines fromthe body fluid entering the intestinal lumen could be converted intouric acid. The uric acid in the intestine would be excreted in the fecesdirectly or as allantoin.This may result in the depletion of the oxypurinebody pools. To test this idea, we administered XOD articial cells to apatient with Lesch-Nyhan disease. Collodion membrane articial cells containing XOD were prepared using the updated method as described in Appendix II under\"Preparation of Enzyme Articial Cells.\" buttermilk, chromatographicallypuried, 50 U at 1-2 U/mg protein). 1 ml articial cells contained 5 UXOD. The XOD articial cells were stored as a 50% suspension insaline solution at 4 C for 0-3 days before use. Since the articial cells are destroyed by pH of less than 3.5, it is important to administer thecells together with a buffer. Volume ratio of articial cells/substrate solution In order to analyze the amount of XOD articial cells needed fororal administration, the following in vitro study was carried out. Fresh substrate solutions were prepared containing 40 \u00b5M hypoxanthine in phposhate buffer (0.1 M), pH 7.5. Four different volume ratios ofarticials/substrate solution were studied, i.e. was converted by xanthine oxidase into uric acid and the reaction was followed by the rate of formation of theproduct, uric acid. Effects of pH on enzyme activity For oral administration, it is important to analyze the relationshipbetween pH and enzyme activity. It is also important to analyze thestability of the collodion articial cells and their contents at differentpH environments. The pH's of the substrate solutions were adjustedusing citric-phposphoric acid-borate-HCl buffer. The following pH'swere studied: pH 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 8.5, 9.5 and 10.5, there wasleakage of all the contents of the articial cells due to destructionof the membrane. At pH 3.5 and above, there was no leakage. Thisaspect is important in the clinical use of the articial cells by oraladministration. The articial cells have to be buffered in order toprevent their destruction in the very acidic stomach environment. The enzyme activity of articial cells containing xanthine oxidase is optimal in the pH range of 8.5 to 9.8 that is normally present in theintestinal lumen. Patient with Lesch-Nyhan disease The patient, a 29-month-old boy with severe Lesch-Nyhan disease (HPRT activity pmol inositic acid/mg protein/h) waswithdrawn from allopurinol therapy over 5 Blood and urine wereobtained at 0830 h and 1630 h. After baseline studies for 3 days, thepatient was treated with 100 U of XOD articial cells via a nasogastrictube twice a day (0900 and 1200 h) for 10 days. A sample of hiscerebrospinal fluid was obtained at 1630 h before treatment and onthe nal day of therapy. Purines were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography and uric acid and creatinine were measured enzymatically andcolorimetrically, respectively.

With the introduction of XOD articial cells, the morning and afternoon ratios fell to normal within 3 days. During a febrileepisode of otitis media the ratios rose transiently. Urinary hypoxanthineexcretion also responded promptly to the XOD treatment, the patternof transient escape during the febrile illness being repeated. The CSFhypoxanthine levels fell by 25% after 10 days of XOD articial celladministration (Fig. 6.7) and the CSF inosine levels fell by 32% (380to 260 ng/ml). The levels of CSF xanthine and uric acid, both normal,remained unchanged. The effect of XOD on plasma inosine was rapid (Fig. 6.8) and within 3 days, the plasma inosine levels had fallen to below 5 \u00b5g/ml. There was a reduction in plasma xanthine levels after day 6.

Conclusion Based on Study The purpose of our short trial of ten days is only to determine if administration of oral XOD articial cells can change the systemiclevels of the different substrates. As such, the very preliminary resultsuggests the feasibility of pursuing the study further. Much longerclinical trials would be needed to observe the neurological changesor behavioral changes. This is an extremely rare inborn error ofmetabolism, and thus we could not nd any commercial interest inmanufacturing this product for use in long term clinical trials. However,the very preliminary demonstration of the safety and effectiveness oforal enzyme articial cells in a patient has led us to develop thisApril 13, 1995 10:56 SPI-B446 Articial Cells: of Enzyme Articial Cells for Genetic Enzyme Defects 147 approach at treating one of the most common genetic enzyme defects, phenylketonuria. 6.9. Phenylketonuria Phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused defect in the liver enzyme, phenylalanine hydroxylase.The resulting increase in the levelof systemic phenylalanine in the rst few years of life can lead to severemental retardation (Nylan, 1974; Scriver, 1989). A low phenylalaninediet is, at present, the only effective treatment for phenylketonuria(Scriver, 1989). This diet must begin very early after birth. However,this diet is difcult to follow and does not prevent elevation of bloodphenylalanine during episodes of fever and infection. Also, it is difcultto use the diet to control the level phenylalanine during pregnancy andelevation can lead to a higher incidence of birth defects. Furthermore,a low phenylalanine diet itself can result in abnormalities in the fetus. Enzyme replacement therapy An alternative to this dietary treatment is the use of enzyme therapy to replace the defective enzyme. However, this liver enzyme is complexand requires cofactors. It is also not stable and there is major problemrelated to large scale isolation and purication. Fortunately, there is anonhuman enzyme, phenylalanine bereadily obtained from glutinis (Hodgins, 1971). It does not require any cofactors and converts phenylalanine into trans-cinnamicacid. The liver converts the product, trans-cinnamic acid into benzoicacid that is excreted via the urine as hippurate. Trans-cinnamate hasvery low toxicity and has no adverse effects on the fetus of laboratoryanimals (Hoskins & Gray, 1982). Earlier attempts to use oral PAL didnot produce any conclusive results (Hoskins et al. , 1980), most likely because the enzyme was destroyed by the tryptic enzymes in theintestine.April 13, Articial Cells Our research on enzyme articial cells suggests that placing PAL inside articial cells would prevent the enzyme from coming intocontact with intestinal tryptic enzymes (Fig. 6.1). At the same time,phenylalanine can enter the articial cells to be converted by PAL. This, together with our basic research on the use of enzyme articial cells for acatalasemia and Lesch-Nyhan disease described earlier, is anencouragement to us to look into the possible use of oral PAL articialcells for phenylketonuria. However, one problem immediately comesto mind. The intestinal contents have amino acid concentrations thatare many times higher than those of the plasma or body fluid. How,then, are we going to extract the amino acid phenylalanine fromthe body fluid into the intestine for removal by the PAL articialcells? Oral PAL articial cells for PKU based on novel theory of enterorecirculation of amino acids Our research has shown the presence of an extensive enterore- circulation of amino acids (Chang et al. , 1989b). Pancreatic and other glandular secretions into the intestine contain large amounts ofproteins, enzymes and polypeptides. Tryptic digestion converts theseinto amino acids which are then reabsorbed back into the body as theypass down the intestine. They are converted by the liver into proteins,enzymes and polypeptides, some of which are again secreted intothe intestine. This forms a large enterorecirculation of amino acidsbetween the body and intestine. Our study shows that the dietaryprotein source of amino acids is negligible when compared withthis recirculation of amino acids. Based on this theory, it would bepossible to administer, orally, articial cells containing one specicenzyme (e.g. phenylalanine ammonia lyase) to lower one specicamino acid (phenylalanine). PAL articial cells given orally to PKUrats is more effective than a phenylalanine-free diet in lowering thelevel phenylalanine in the intestine, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Whereas PKU rats on PHE-free diet lost weight, those on oral PAL articial cells continued to grow and gained weight during the study. The following sections describe the above studies in detail.April 13, 1995 10:56 SPI-B446 Articial Cells: Enzyme Articial Cells for Genetic Enzyme Defects 149 6.10. Research Leading to Proposal of Enterorecirculation of Amino Acids Classical theory of the main source of amino acids in the intestinal lumen It is commonly thought that the tryptic digestion of proteins from ingested food constitutes the major source of amino acids in theintestinal lumen.These intestinal amino acids are then absorbed as theypass through the intestinal tract. The pancreatic and other glandularsecretions are mainly to function in supplying the required digestiveenzymes. The contributions of these secretions as a source of intestinalamino acids are not usually thought to be of major signicance. Research to test the classical theory We give the animal nothing by mouth except sucrose and water ad libitum for 24 h. If dietary protein is indeed the major source of intestinal amino acids, then there should be a signicant decrease inthe amino acids in the intestine compared to the control group onstandard diet. Animals on 24 h of protein-free diet Male Sprague Dawley rats (275-330 grams) were purchased fromCharles River Co., St. Constant, Quebec. For 24 h, the control groupsreceived Purina Rat Chow (Ralston Purina, Montreal, Quebec) plus tapwater ad libitum . The protein-free diet groups received a diet of sugar cubes (Redpath Sugar Co., Montreal) and 10 g/dl glucose in tap water.Both groups of rats stayed in metabolic cages to prevent their accessto the feces. Results of study Figure 6.10 shows the results obtained. In the duodenum thereis surprisingly no signicant difference in the amount of aminoacids between the control group on normal diet and the group onprotein-free diet. The same results are observed for the jejunumApril 13, 1995 10:56 SPI-B446 Articial 150 Articial Cells and ileum. The concentration of amino acids decreases down the intestinal tract as amino acids are absorbed. However, there isno signicant difference between the two groups throughout allsegments. There is an extremely high concentration of intestinal amino acids as compared to the plasma concentration \u2014 more than 1000-fold inthe duodenum. Since the main source of amino acids in the intestinedoes not appear to be the proteins from ingested food, what then isthe source of the intestinal amino acids in the protein-free diet group,and indeed in the normal control group? Proposed theory of extensive enterorecirculation of amino acids I thought that based on the above results, the most likely major source of intestinal amino acids could be the gastric, pancreatic, intestinaland other intestinal secretions (Fig. 6.9). Tryptic digestion converts thelarge amount of proteins, enzymes, polypeptides and peptides in thesecretions into amino acids. These amino acids are then reabsorbedby the body as they pass through the intestine. Continuing pancreaticand intestinal secretions into the intestine constitutes the source ofamino acids. This forms a large enterorecirculation of amino acidsbetween the body and intestine. Since the protein-free diet did not alterthe intestinal amino acid concentration, the dietary source of aminoacids was negligible when compared to that from the pancreatic andintestinal secretions. In enterorecirculation, the reabsorption of amino acids from the intestine into the plasma could be based on standard aminoacid transport mechanisms. The transport of amino acids fromthe gastrointestinal lumen into the plasma has been extensivelyinvestigated (Stevens et al. , 1984). Amino acids are generally transported across membranes by passive or active carrier transportmechanisms (Berteloot et al. , 1982). Stevens et al. , (1984) added to this classication a non-saturable diffusion PHE transport system thatcontributes signicantly to the transport of phenylalanine in both thebrush the of Enzyme Articial Cells for Genetic Enzyme Defects 151 Fig. 6.9.

Oral Enzyme Articial Cells for Genetic Enzyme Defects that Result in Elevated Systemic Amino Acid Levels As discussed above, very surprisingly and unexpectedly, our result shows that the major source of amino acids in the intestine appearsto be the extensive enterorecirculation of amino acids. Immediately,this raises the possibility of using this for selective depletion of specicbody amino acids. This is somewhat along the line of using bindersto remove the enterorecirculation of bile acid, thereby lowering thesystemic cholesterol level. However, unlike bile acid, there are 26amino acids in the body and usually only one amino acid needsto be selectively depleted. This is where the specicity of articialcells microencapsulated enzyme plays a part. one specic enzyme (e.g. phenylalanineammonia lyase) should be able to remove only one specic aminoacid (e.g. phenylalanine) (Fig. 6.9). General design for study of use of oral PAL articial cells in PKU rats In this study, we will determine whether oral PAL articial cells can deplete a specic amino acid, phenylalanine, from PKU rats.This studywill also serve as a further test of the enterorecirculation theory. Thisstudy consists of the following groups: normal rats; PKU rats on normaldiet; PKU PKU rats on PHE-free diet; andPKU rats on normal diet treated with oral PAL articial cells. If there isextensive enterorecirculation, the intestinal PHE level should be aboutthe same as for the PKU rats on normal diet, PKU rats on high proteindiet and PKU rats on PHE-free diet. Furthermore, PKU rats on normaldiet treated with PAL articial cells should have very low phenylalaninein the intestine. In addition, if there is an extensive enterorecirculationof amino acids, then the treatment using oral PAL articial cells shouldbe more effective than that using PHE-free diet alone in lowering thesystemic PHE levels (Bourget and Chang, 1985, 1986). The results tobe discussed in detail later is summarized in Fig. 6.10.April 13, 1995 10:56 SPI-B446 Articial Cells: of Enzyme Articial Cells for Genetic Enzyme Defects 153 Fig. 6.10.

Phenylketonuria rat model We used the rat model based on the administration of phenylalanine hydroxylase inhibitors (Anderson & Guroff, 1974). Male SpragueDawley rats, 42-day-old, (Charles River, Canada) were used to preparethe PKU rat model. The average weight of the 42-day-old rats was150 g on day 1 of the experiment. They are kept in a controlled 12 hlight/dark environment with food and water ad libitum . The rats are separated at random into ve groups: 1) Normal rats receiving a normaldiet; 2) PKU rats receiving a normal diet; 3) PKU rats receiving ahigh-protein diet; 4) PKU rats receiving a PHE-free diet (Zeigler Bros.,Inc. (USA)) and 5) PKU rats receiving a normal diet plus oral PALarticial cells \u2014 dose of 0.8 ml containing 10 unit PAL/ml. Thesearticial cells are prepared by the updated method described in the Appendix under \"Updated Methods for the Preparation of Articial Cells\" using collodion membrane articial cells. Phenylalanine wasobtained from plasma, cerebral spinal fluid and intestines justbefore PKU induction and 7 days after induction following the aboveregimes. The samples were analyzed for amino acids using highperformance liquid chromatography. Intestinal phenylalanine The intestinal PHE concentrations in the normal rats receiving a normal diet did not show any signicant changes in the intestine from day 1to day 7 (Fig. 6.10). In PKU-induced rats receiving a normal diet, therewere signicant increases in the PHE concentrations (Fig. 6.10). Whatis most striking is that even in the PKU-induced rats receiving PHE-freediets, there were also signicant increases in the PHE concentrations inthe duodenum, jejunum and ileum (Fig. 6.10). This is so even thoughno PHE was given by the oral route. This serves to further supportthe theory of enterorecirculation of amino acids from pancreaticApril 13, Cells: of Enzyme Articial Cells for Genetic Enzyme Defects 155 and other glandular secretions. PKU-induced rats receiving a normal diet and oral PAL articial cells showed a dramatic decrease in theintestinal PHE especially in the duodenum. This seems to show thatPAL articial cells enzymatically degraded most of the PHE in theintestine (Fig. 6.10). This lends further support to the proposal that PALarticial cells remove PHE from the enterorecirculation. Plasma PHE levels in PKU rats Normal rats receiving a normal diet showed no signicant changes inplasma PHE levels during the 7 days (Fig. 6.10). PKU rats receiving anormal diet or high-protein diet showed an elevated PHE level whichis more than 10-fold compared to normal rats ( Fig. 6.10). By the 7thday, the plasma levels of PKU rats receiving PHE-free diet was stillsignicantly higher than those at the normal control rats (Fig. 6.10). Onthe other hand, by the 7th day, the plasma PHE levels in PAL articialcells-treated PKU rats were not signicantly different from those of thenormal control rats (Fig. 6.10). CSF cerebrospinal fluid in PKU rats The normal rats showed no signicant changes in the CSF PHE level from day 1 to day 7 (Fig. 6.10). The PKU rats on normal diet orhigh-protein diet showed a signicantly elevated level of CSF PHE(Fig. 6.10). On day 7, PKU rats receiving PHE-free diet showed asignicantly higher level of CSF PHE when compared to day 1 or thecontrol (Fig. 10). However, the level is signicantly lower than that inthe PKU rats receiving a normal diet or high-protein diet. With PALarticial cells given to PKU rats on normal diet, the PHE levels inthe CSF were not signicantly different from those of the normal rats(Fig. 6.10). Growth as shown by body weight changes Normal rats receiving a normal diet grew normally as shown bya signicant increase of body weight after 7 days (Fig. 6.11).

Furthermore, there was a decrease in muscletone over the same period of time. PKU rats receiving a PHE-free dietlost signicantly more weight than PKU rats on normal diet. They alsoshowed a loss of muscle tone. PKU rats on a normal diet treatedwith oral PAL articial cells had a small but signicant increase inbody weight. Abnormal signs such as piloerection, aggression andhyperactivity, observed in PKU-induced rats, were no longer presentafter 5 days of treatment with PAL articial cells. We then looked at the daily changes in body weight, comparing normal rats, with PKU rats on PHE-free diet and PKU rats receivingdifferent amounts of PAL articial cells. As shown in Fig. 6.12, normal rats receiving a normal diet showed a steady and signicant increase in body weight throughout the 7-dayperiod. PKU rats receiving a normal diet but no PAL articial cells,showed a signicant decrease in body weight, and in addition, adecrease in muscle tone over the same period.

(modied from Bourget and Chang, 1986). diet treated with 5 units of oral PAL articial cells lost weight initially. However, they started to gain weight in the next 4 days at the same rateas the normal control rats. This corresponded to the time it took for theelevated plasma PHE level to return to normal. Abnormal signs such aspiloerection, aggression and hyperactivity, observed in PKU-inducedrats, were no longer present after 5 days of treatment with PAL articialcells. PKU rats on a normal diet receiving lower doses (1.0 or 2.5 units)of PAL in articial cells lost weight at the same rate as the PKU rats ona normal diet. Those receiving 2.5 units was only slight better off. Congenital PKU mice model We tried to use a congenital mouse PKU model (Shedlovsky et al. , 1993) for the above studies. However, the small size of the very youngmice and the tendency for \"hairy balls\" to accumulate in stomachApril 13, Regenerative... ch06 FA 158 Articial Cells of these mice, has made it difcult in our hands for the long term daily gastric tube administration of 50 \u00b5PAL articial cells. XOD articial cells also tended to jam the very small diameter gastric tubes used fororal administration. Summary discussion The above results contribute to the scientic basis for the potential therapeutic uses of PAL articial cells in PKU, and also serve tocompare the use of PAL articial cells with a PHE-free diet. PAL inarticial cells acts on PHE diffusing into the articial cells and convertthe substrate into transcinnamic acid. Transcinnamic acid is not toxicand is converted to hippuric acid by the liver and excreted in theurine. The articial cells carry out their function as they move downthe intestinal lumen and nally leave the body in the feces. There is,therefore, no accumulation of articial cells in the body. However, it isimportant to administer enzyme articial cells together with a buffer toprotect them during their passage through the highly acidic stomach. At a pH of 3.5 or lower, there will be breakage of the membranes of the articial cells. The safety of oral administration of enzyme articial cells has been shown. Thus, we have given oral articial cells containing xanthineoxidase to lower the systemic hypoxanthine in experimental therapy inLesch-Nyhan disease (Chang, 1989a; Palmer & Chang, 1989). Articialcells containing urease and ammonium adsorbent have also beengiven to animals (Chang, 1972a) and patients in clinical trials withno adverse effect reported (Kjellstrand, 1981). Before using this in human phenylketonuria, a key challenge has to be solved \u2014 phenylalanine ammonia lyase is extremely expensive. There are two groups developing recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase that is less costly (Sarkissian et al. , 1999; Liu et al. , 2002). Oral enzyme articial cells to deplete other amino acids The proposal of oral enzyme articial cells based on the new nding of enterorecirculation of amino acids could also be studied forApril 13, 1995 10:56 SPI-B446 Articial Cells: of Enzyme Articial Cells for Genetic Enzyme Defects 159 other genetic enzyme defects. These include the removal of tyrosine in tyrosinemia, histidine in histidinemia, and others. In addition,the basic results obtained here can be useful for analyzing thefeasibility for use in other conditions. One example is the use oforal administration of articial cells containing asparaginase to lowerasparagine in leukemia. Asparaginase is used as an adjunct treatmentin chemotherapy, but it has side effects when injected intravenouslyon a repeated basis. Oral use of asparaginase articial cells if effective,would avoid the adverse effects related to intravenous injection.Removal of glutamine is another example. The use of oral tyrosinasearticial cells can effectively lower the systemic tyrosinase level. As described in the next chapter, we are studying this for potential application in melanoma, a skin cancer that depends on tyrosine forgrowth.April 2, 7 Enzyme Articial Cells in Substrate-dependent Tumors and Activation of Prodrug 7.1. Introduction Our basic laboratory research described in Chapter 6, shows that after parenteral injection, enzymes in articial cells can carry out itsfunction for a much longer period of time when compared with freeenzymes. Furthermore, enzyme articial cells can effectively lowersystemic amino acids and other unwanted molecules and at the sametime prevent the enclosed enzymes from giving rise to immunologicalreactions. This principle can also be applied to the use of enzymearticial cells in substrate-dependent tumors and also for activationof prodrugs (Fig. 7.1A). The rst study carried out was on the effectof parenteral injection of asparaginase articial cells on 6C3HEDlymphosarcoma in mice (Chang, 1971a).The promising result obtainedfrom this study has led to further detailed studies in this laboratoryfollowed by development of this principle by other laboratories in theform of different congurations of the articial cell idea (Fig. 7.1B).One successful extension is the use of a polymer, polyethylene glycol,to surround a single asparaginase molecule, PEG-asparaginase, toprolong in vivo action and prevent immunological problems (Park et al. , 1981). Different congurations of enzyme articial cells have also been investigated for tyrosine-dependent melanoma (Yu andChang, 2004) and for the activation of a prodrug into its active formfor pancreatic CA (Lorh Enzyme Articial Cells 161 Fig. 7.1. (A) Basic principle of enzyme articial cells in experimental tumor therapy. 7.2. Asparaginase in Lymphosarcoma and Lymphoblastic Leukemia Guinea pig serum suppresses the growth of mice lymphosarcoma (Kidd, 1953) because its asparaginase can deplete the supply ofasparagine to asparagine-dependent tumors (Broome, 1961). As-paraginase can be more readily obtained from the bacteria Escherichia coli or Erwinia for use in large-scale studies (Mashburn , 1970) show that parenterally injected E. coliasparaginase is removed rapidly as a foreign protein and the antitumor activity of asparaginase is related to the time it can stay inthe circulation. More recent studies show that asparaginase is effectivein the treatment of some types of leukemia by removing systemicasparagine (Hawkin et al. , 2004). However, being a foreign protein, there are frequent allergic and immunological reactions involved. These problems severely limit the usefulness of asparaginase even though asparaginase therapy can be an important component in thetreatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia Regenerative... ch07 FA 162 Articial Cells Fig. 7.1. (B) After the demonstration of effectiveness of asparaginase articial cells in a mice model of lymphosarcoma (Chang, 1971a), different extensionof this principle have been developed. 7.3. Asparaginase Cells for Lymphosarcoma Asparaginase articial cells on in mice (Fig. 7.2A) In the in vivo experiments (Chang, 1971a), each mouse received a subcutaneous injection of 500,000 6C3HED lymphosarcoma cellsin the groin.

Figure 7.2B shows the time when thetumors rst appeared.The time when the tumor rst appeared was 9.0 + 0.9 days (mean \u00b1SD) for those which had received saline injections; 8.7+1.6 days for those which had received control articial cells injections; and 14.0 +4.5 days for those which had received a single intraperitoneal injection of asparaginase solution. In the group thathad received a single intraperitoneal injection of asparaginase-loadedarticial cells, no tumor appeared in 50 percent of the implanted sitesafter 120 days. Thus, when compared with the asparaginase solution,the microencapsulated form was much more effective in suppressingthe growth of implanted mouse lymphosarcoma (Fig. Regenerative... ch07 FA 164 Articial Cells Fig. 7.2.

Effects on plasma asparagine level Four groups of mice were used (Chang, 1973). Each mouse inthe two control groups received either an intraperitoneal injectionof 1 ml of saline or 1ml suspension of control articial cellscontaining no asparaginase. Each mouse in the third group receivedan intraperitoneal injection of 1 ml of saline containing 5 IUof asparaginase. Each mouse in the fourth group received anintraperitoneal injection of asparaginase articial cells with an assayedactivity of 5 IU. Figure 7.3 shows that intraperitoneal injection ofcontrol saline and control articial cells did not levels. intraperitoneal injection of5 IU of asparaginase in saline caused 2, Articial Cells 165 Fig. 7.3. Effects on plasma tyrosine level from one intraperitoneal injection of (a) saline: control group receiving saline; (b) control AC: control groupreceiving cells. (From Chang, 1973.) asparagines level to zero and maintained it at zero for 3 days, after which the plasma asparagines returned to the pre-injection level. Thesame assayed amount of asparaginase in articial cells retained a zeroplasma asparagine level for up to 7 days, the level returning to normalonly after 11 days (Chang, 1973). Asparaginase activities in the body Each mouse in the two control group received an intraperitonealinjection of 1 ml saline or 1 ml 50% suspension of control articialcells containing no asparaginase. The third group each received0.5 IU/g body weight of asparaginase solution. The fourth groupeach received articial cells containing asparaginase (0.5 IU/g bodyweight). Total body asparaginase were measured at the time intervalsshown in Fig. 7.4 for a total of 16 days (Sui-chong and Chang,1974). As shown in Fig. 7.4, there were no signicant detectableasparaginase in the two control groups. In those groups that receivedone intraperitoneal injection of asparaginase solution, Regenerative... ch07 FA 166 Articial Cells Fig. 7.4. Effects on total body asparaginase levels from one intraperitoneal injection of (a) control AC: control group receiving articial cells containingno asparaginase; articial cells.(From Sui-Chong and Chang, 1974.) body enzyme activity decreased to less that 50% b y4ha n d became undetectable 16 h after injection. On the other hand, inthose mice receiving one intraperitoneal injection of asparaginasearticial cells, it took 60 to 72 h for the asparaginase activityto decrease to 50% of the initial acitivity. By 16 days, 20%of the asparaginase activity can still be found (Siu and Chang, 1974). Thus, the use of asparaginase articial cells can very signicantly increase the duration of asparaginase activity in the body after oneparenteral injection. Asparaginase does not leak out of articial cells after injection In order to avoid hypersensitivity and immunological reactions, the asparaginase should, after injection, stay inside the articial cell toact on asparagines diffusing into the Articial Cells 167 that there was no detectable asparaginase leakage from the articial cells into the plasma for the entire 16 days period of this study (Sui-chong and Chang, 1974). Thus, no detectable asparaginase leaked outof the articial cells into the circulating blood. On the other hand, afterintraperitoneal injected of asparaginase solution, the enzyme rapidlyleaked out of the implanted site into the plasma, reaching a peak after4 h. It was then cleared rapidly from the circulation. Further studies shows that after intraperitoneal injection, articial cells could be found intact and dispersed in the peritoneal cavity after1, 2 and 3 days. On the 6th day, they still remained intact and dispersed,but tended to form small aggregates (Fig. 7.2A). In separate experimentusing 80 \u00b5m mean diameter nylon, articial cells containing 51Cr- labelled hemoglobin were injected intraperitoneally. After the rstweek, the articial cells were well dispersed over the whole peritonealcavity. After the second week, they were found in larger numbers in theupper parts of the peritoneal cavities. No signicant radioactivity wasdetected in the lung, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, blood or particle- freeperitoneal washings. Recovered radioactivity was associated with thearticial cells in the peritoneal cavity for 4 weeks and the 51Cr-labelled hemoglobin did not leak out of the articial cells. These results furthersupport the observation that after parenteral injection, asparaginaseremained inside the articial cells and continue to act on asparaginediffusing into the cells. In the case of free asparaginase, it enters thecirculation and is rapidly removed as foreign proteins. Discussions The above results explain why one intraperitoneal injection of as- paraginase articial cells is effective in signicantly delaying thegrowth of lymphosarcoma when compared with one intraperitonealinjection of asparaginase solution (Fig. 7.2B). Thus, asparaginaseinside articial cells remained active in the body for a much longerlength of time when compared with the asparaginase solution.Furthermore, one intraperitoneal injection of asparaginase articialcells can maintain a low system asparagine level for a signicantlylonger period of time when compared with the enzyme in free solution.April 2, 2007 Regenerative... ch07 FA 168 Articial Cells What is perhaps even more important is that, unlike asparaginase solution, asparaginase inside articial cells does not leak out intothe circulation after injection. This would avoid the hypersensitivityand immunological problem related to asparaginase solution. Indeed,the basic study carried out using catalase articial cells described inChapter 6, shows that an enzyme inside articial cells is preventedfrom causing immunological reactions after injection. Thus, ourresearch supports the feasibility of using the principle of articial cellsto prevent problems related to the use of free asparaginase. This hasled to further development to extend this approach. 7.4. Crosslinking Asparaginase to Hemoglobin (PolyHb-Asparaginase) Our study shows that we can increase the enzyme stability of urease, catalase and asparaginase by crosslinking them with an excess of hemoglobin molecules (Chang, 1971b).We carried out, further, a studyon the effect of crosslinking asparaginase into polyHb-asparaginase(Chang, 1973d) (Fig. 7.5A). This way, asparaginase is surrounded byan excess of hemoglobin molecules, thus preventing the enzyme frominteracting with the external environment. At the same time, smallmolecules like asparagine can diffuse into the enzyme for conversion.Crosslinking to macromolecules also stabilizes the conformation ofasparaginase. When kept at a body temperature of 37 C, PolyHb- asparaginase inside articial cells retained 25% of the initial activityafter 110 days (Fig. 7.5B). On the otherhand, without crosslinking,asparaginase with hemoglobin inside articial cells retained 25%of the initial asparaginase activity after less than 15 days at 37 C (Fig. 7.5B). Both are stable at a storage temperature of 4C for 110 days without signicant loss of enzyme activity (Chang, 1973d). Thein vitro stability of asparaginase articial cells at 37 C is comparable to the that after injection into the animal (Fig. 7.4). The much higherstability of asparaginase crosslinked to hemoglobin in the form ofpolyHb-asparaginase (Fig. 7.5A) should allow for a signicantly longerperiod of after injection.April 2, an excess of hemoglobin molecule to form polyHb-asparaginaseinside articial cells. Each molecule of asparaginase thus stabilizes andseparates the enzyme from the external large molecules while allowingasparagine to enter for conversion. Fig. 7.5. (B) Comparison of the stability of asparaginase stored at body temperature of 37C: S37 Cells 7.5. Crosslinking of Asparaginase to Polymer (Polyethylene Glycol \u2014 PEG) The research discussed above showing the use of articial cells to prevent immunological reactions and to increase the duration ofenzyme activity, was based on articial cells of micron diameter(Chang, 1971a). This is achieved by using interfacial polymerizationto form an ultrathin polymer membrane in the form of articial cellscontaining enzymes, including asparaginase. A further extension ofthis method, as discussed in Section 7.5, is to crosslink hemoglobinto asparaginase to form polyHb-asparaginase, resulting in a markedincrease in stability at body temperature (Chang, 1973d). Instead ofcrosslinking asparaginase with Hb, a further extension is to crosslinkasparaginase with a soluble polymer, polyethylene glycol (PEG-asparaginase) (Park, , Asselin et al. , 1993, Duncan, 2003) (Figs. 7.1B, 7.6). This also uses the principle of articial cells (Fig. 7.1A) in that the surrounding polymermolecules prevents the direct contact of the enzyme with the external Asparaginase moleculeasparagineproductPolyethylene glycol copolymer AntibodyNANO PEG-ASPARAGINASE 7.6. Instead hemoglobin to crosslink with asparaginase to form PolyHb-asparaginase, an extension is to use synthetic polymer,polyethylene glycol (PEG), to form PEG-asparaginase (Park et al. , 1981). The surrounding PEG similarly stabilize and separate asparaginase from external large molecules while allowing asparaginase to enter for conversion.April 2, 2007 Articial Cells 171 environment, thus preventing immunological reactions and at the same time rapid removal of asparagine is achieved (Figs. 7.1A,7.6). Substrates like asparagine, can diffuse through the surroundingpolymer to interact with the enzyme (Fig. 7.1A, 7.6) Studies show that PEG-asparaginase indeed has reduced im- munogenicity as well as a 5-fold increase in half-life when comparedwith native E. coli asparaginase et al. 1981; Abuchowski et al. ,1984; Asselin et al. , 1993). A randomized clinical study was carried out in children with untreated acute lymphoblastic leukemiacomparing the native asparaginase from E. coli to PEG-asparaginase (Avramis et al. , 2002). When compared with the native asparaginase, PEG-asparaginase has a longer duration of in vivo enzyme activity and also a lower incidence of high titer antibodies to asparaginase.In children with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia, weekly PEG-asparaginase injection resulted in a higher remission induction rateof 97% as compared to 82% with biweekly injection of nativeasparaginase (Abshire et al., 2000). With the longer duration of action, fortnightly injection of PEG-asparaginase is as effective as injection2-3 times/week of native asparaginase (Duncan 2003; Harris andChess, 2003). Hawkins et al. (2004), reported their study on the combined use of PEG-asparaginase with chemotherapy for relapsed pediatricacute lymphoblastic leukemia. This includes IU/m that PEG-asparaginase (2500 IU/m2 intramuscularly, once on day 7). Serum and CSF asparagine levelswere lowered and maintained during this period in the majority ofsamples. PEG-asparaginase antibody was detected in only three of the28 patients. Of the 28 patients, 24 showed remissions; two patientsdied from infection during induction, and two failed to achieve aremission. They concluded that intensive PEG-asparaginase therapyin relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia results in lowering of theasparagine, and the use of PEG-asparaginase in further trials forrecurrent acute lymphoblastic leukemia yrosinase Articial Cells for Melanoma Introduction Melanoma, a fatal skin cancer, is a common tumor which accounts for 10% of all malignancies. The incidence of melanoma has risendramatically in the last century, doubling every 10 years in manycountries. The incidence is now approximately 10 per 100,000 perannum in Europe, giving an approximate lifetime risk of 1 in 200(Katsambas, Nicolaidou, 1996). Melanoma is most commonly foundon the skin, with 10% in the eyes. At least 20% of people diagnosedwith melanoma progress to advanced disease and die within ve yearsof diagnosis (Borden, 2002). At present, despite the use of adjuvanttherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and radiation therapy, themedian survival of patients with metastatic melanoma is about sixmonths. Tyrosine is important in the metabolic cycle of melanoma and malignant melanomas require higher concentrations of tyrosine thanother cells for growth. Research, especially those from Meadows'group, has shown from in animal studies, that lowering of systemictyrosine using tyrosine and phenylalanine restricted diet can inhibitthe growth of melanoma in vitro and in vivo (Meadow and Oeser, 1983; Fuet al. , 1997). However, low tyrosine diets are not well tolerated by human, resulting in weight loss and other adverse effects in patients(Meadow et al., 1982). Furthermore, restricted diet can only lower the systemic tyrosine level to about 67% of the normal levels (Meadowet al. , 1982). Polyhemoglobin-tyrosinase for melanoma We therefore introduce a new approach to chemically crosslinking tyrosinase with an excess of hemoglobin to form a solublepolyhemoglobin-tyrosinase (PolyHb-tyrosinase) complex (Figs. 7.1B,7.7A). This is similar to the PolyHb-asparaginase as described inSection 7.5. PolyHb-tyrosinase carries out two functions: 1) Tyrosinase can remove tyrosine needed for growth by With molarApril 2, & Chang 2004) Fig. 7.7. (A) Melanoma needs a higher concentration of tyrosine for growth. Similar to PolyHb-asparaginase, crosslinking of an excess of hemoglobin totyrosinase also stabilizes and separates the tyrosinase from the external largemolecules, while allowing tyrosine to enter for conversion. ratio of 100 Hb: 2 tyorinase, tyrosinase is covered and protected by the polyhemoglobin (PolyHb) from immunological and other adverseeffects and from rapid removal from the circulation after intravenousinjection; 2) The polyHb component can supply oxygen during theperiod of action of tyroinase. It is well known that disturbances ofthe microcirculations of tumor result in poor perfusion by red bloodcells and thus low oxygen tension (Fig. 7.7B). Adequate oxygentension is needed to facilitates radiation and chemotherapy, andPolyHb by itself, has been shown to improve the effectiveness ofchemotherapy in animals with glioma (Pearce et al. , 1998)(Fig. 7.7C). Thus, the polyHb component of PolyHb-tyrosinase can supply the needed oxygen. In the form of polyHb-tyrosinase, both componentscirculate for the same length of time, thus complementing each other(Fig. 7.7B). Our study shows that intravenous injection of PolyHb-tyrosinase retards the growth of melanoma in a mice model (Yu and Chang,2004a).

The end point of this study is based onMcGill Faculty of Medicine Animal Care Committee's regulation thattumor burden should not exceed 10% of the animal's normal bodyweight. Figure 7.7C shows that there is no signicant difference in thetumor size between the control group and the sham control group. Onthe other hand, 4 days after the daily intravenous injection of PolyHb-tyrosinase, the tumor volume is signicantly lower than in the controlgroup (Figs. 7.7C and 7.8A). Six days after the daily intravenouslyinjection, the tumor volume in the PolyHb-tyrosinase group is only53.49 \u00b113.91% of that in the control group (Figs. 7.7C and 7.8A).

At this time, the tumor size in the test groupwas only 45.28 \u00b110.09% of the control group (Figs. 7.7C and 7.8A). What is also very important is that there is no loss in body weight (Fig. 7.8B). This shows that the use of polyHb-tyrosinase prevents themajor problem related to tyrosinase restricted diet that causes nausea,vomiting and weight loss. Studies on optimization, in vitro and in vivo characterization Before the above study in the melanoma mice model, we have carried out detailed studies to characterize the in vitro and in vivo properties of PolyHb-tyrosinase (Yu and Chang, 2002, 2004a, 2004c,2004e and 2006). This includes optimization of the method ofpreparation and in vitro and in vivo characterization of PolyHb- tyrosinase (Yu and Chang, 2004e). These studies showed that PolyHb-tyroinase can lower plasma tyrosinase in mice without causingvomiting and weight loss. Furthermore, polyHb-tyroinase itsApril 2, Enzyme Articial Cells 177 ability to inhibit the growth of melanoma cell culture and retains its ability to carry oxygen. This leads to the above study on the actual useof this preparation in a melanoma mice model. After optimization andin vitro and in vivo characterization of the preparation, we carried out the following studies. We carried out a study of the effects of intravenous injection of PolyHb-tyrosinase in normal mice. Daily intravenous injection of PolyHb-tyrosinase in the test group, reduces plasma tyrosine levels rapidly to 0.19 \u00b10.09 mg/dl on day 2, compared with 1.44 \u00b10.16 mg/dl in the control group (Fig. 7.9A). This low level was maintainedby daily intravenous injection of polyHb-tyrosinase. Since one ofthe adverse effects of the use of tyrosine restricted diet is nausea,vomiting and weight loss, we observed the mice for the occurrenceof the side effect. Daily measurements of body weight showed nodifference between the control group and the test group receivingdaily intravenous injection.

The PolyHb component of PolyHb-tyrosinase also retained its ability to carry and release oxygen when as comparedto hemoglobin (Fig. 7.9B). Next, we analyzed the effects of PolyHb-tyrosinase on the growth of melanoma cell culture. We cultured B16F10 melanoma cells inDMEM and added one of the following four solutions to the culturemedium: 1) saline solution (0.9 g/dl solution. Figure 7.9Bshows that PolyHb by itself does not have any effects on the growthof the B16F10 cells as compared to saline. When compared to nativetyrosinase, PolyHb-tyrosinase retains its ability to inhibit the growth ofB16F10 melanoma cells in vitro .

These results encourage further studiesto further optimization and to investigate the combined use of thisapproach with other methods like radiation and chemotherapy fortreating malignant melanoma. 7.7. T yrosinase Articial Cells by Oral Route Introduction As described in Chapter 6, our earlier basic research showed that there is an extensive enterorecirculation of amino acids betweenApril 2, 2007 Regenerative... ch07 FA 180 Articial Cells the intestine and the body (Fig. 6.9). This allows us to use oral administration of enzyme articial cells to effectively lower the amountof a specic amino acid, phenylalanine, in a phenylketonuria ratmodel. The amount of any specic amino acid in the body can beby selecting articial cells with the corresponding enzyme (Fig. 6.9).Furthermore, our earlier preliminary results showed that oral tyrosinasearticial cells can lower the level of tyrosine in the small intestine,ileum (Chang et al. , 1988/1989). We therefore investigated the use of articial cells containing tyrosinase for the removal of systemic tyrosine(Yu and Chang, 2004b) (Fig. 7.11A). Effects of Long-term Oral Administration of Polymeric Microcapsules Containing T yrosinase on MaintainingDecreased Systemic T yrosine Levels in Rats The concentration of tyrosine in plasma, as for all other amino acids, tends to fluctuate even though the time of feeding and blood collection Fig. 7.11.

(A)Schematic representation of the removal of tyrosine from the enterorecirculation, thus lowering the system Cells 181 Fig. 7.11. (B) Tyrosine in the small intestine, ileum, is signicantly lowered. Plasma tyrosine is also lowered, but because of the large intracellular poolof tyrosine, it takes time for the plasma tyrosine level to decrease. Unlike theuse of tyrosine restricted diet, this approach does not result in weight losssince there is no signicant differences between the animals' weight in thecontrol and the group receiving asparaginase articial cells. are the same.This fluctuation is a normal phenomenon in all rat studies. Thus, we take the tyrosine level in the control group as 100%; the other data are expressed as a percentage of the original activity. Eachgroup received 3 times daily either control articial cells containingno tyrosinase (control group) or Regenerative... ch07 FA 182 Articial Cells Both groups of rats were maintained on a regular rat chow. In the test group, there was a slow decrease of plasma tyrosine level inthe rst 3 days, because of the time taken for the large intracellularpool of tyrosine to equilibrate with the extracellular pool. On day 4there was a signicant decrease in tyrosine level in the test group to68.8%. By days 18 and 22, the systemic tyrosine levels decreased to56.8% and 52.6%, respectively. Our result showed that three timesdaily oral administration can lower the tyrosine concentration in arat's plasma, starting from day 4 to a level that, based on Meadowet al. 's (1982) tyrosine restricted diet study, would retard the growth of melanoma. However, unlike the group on the tyrosine restricted diet,the test group on oral treatment did not lose any weight. Instead, theygained weight with a weight gain curve identical to that of the controlgroup (Fig. 7.11B). No abnormal effect or behavior was observed inboth groups. In a separate set of study using one dose daily, there wasno signicant decrease in tyrosine level. With two doses daily, it took14 days for the plasma tyrosine level to fall to 69.9%, and reaching55.8% only by the 21st day. Thus, it would appear that three dosesdaily would be more effective. If it is important to lower the plasmatyrosine level more quickly to a lower level, one can start with oneor two intravenous injection of PolyHb-tyrosinase, to be followed bythree doses daily of oral tyrosinase articial cells. This has been tested(Fig. 7.12) and the plasma tyrosine level is shown to be rapidly loweredafter 1 day. It may be necessary to give another intravenous injectionof PolyHb-tyrosinase on day 2, since the plasma tyrosine level rises onday 3 (Fig. 7.12). Enzyme kinetics Before carrying out the above study, we have carried out a numberof optimization and characterization studies (Yu and Chang, 2004b). This includes analysis of the enzyme kinetics showing the following. For free tyrosinase, V K mis 4.65 \u00d7104M.

In order to increase the rate of decrease of tyrosine, 1 or 2 intravenous PolyHb-tyrosinase can be given at the beginning followed byoral asparaginase articial cells to maintain a low asparagine level. enzyme kinetics and the stability of the enzyme. Figure 7.13A shows that both the free enzyme, and tyrosinase articial cells have similarenzyme activity at pH of 6 and 7. However, at lower or higher pH,tyrosinase articial cells have a higher enzyme activity. This is becausearticial cells contain a high concentration of hemoglobin (10g dl) thatacts as a buffer and the internal pH is different from the external pH.Figure 7.13B shows the stability of tyrosinase in articial cells afterincubation fo r1ha t3 7 C. Despite the high concentration of Hb, at pH 2 and 4, there is a signicant decrease in enzyme activity after 1h at the body temperature of 37 C. As a result, for oral administration, we have to include a buffer in the suspending medium of tyrosinasearticial cells. We have also analyzed the ability of the tyrosinase articial cells to lower the tyrosine level in intestinal juice before using the articialcells for the study on oral administration. Tyrosinase articial cellsare incubated at 37 C in a shaker with fresh intestinal juice obtained from anesthetized rat. Figure 7.14 shows that in both the groups,there is an initial decrease in tyrosine level due to the dilution of theApril 2, Regenerative... ch07 FA 184 Articial Cells 2 4 6 7 10 Activity pH kinetic of tyrosinase and tyrosinase articial cells.

In the case of control articial cells containing no tyrosinase, the tyrosine level decreasedby about 50% from the initial level of 177.58 \u00b129.92 mg/dl.

Tyrosinase articial cells and control articial cells containing no tyrosinase are each suspended in fresh intestinal juice at 37C. The initial decrease in tyrosine is due to the dilution effect of adding the suspensions. After this, tyrosine in the control group keeps increasing as protein in the intestine is digested by the intestinal tryptic enzyme. However, tyrosinasearticial cells lowers and maintains a low tyrosine level. enterorecirculation in Chapter 6 (Fig. 6.1), glandular and intestinal secretions result in intestinal juice containing high concentrationsof proteins, enzymes, polypeptides and peptides. Intestinal trypticenzymes break these down into amino acids including tyrosine, thus,the increase in tyrosine level. For the tyrosinase articial cell group,the tyrosine concentration in the intestinal fluid of 200.25 \u00b110.16 mg/dl to 73.34 \u00b114.72 mg/dl at 33 min. We used this in vitro model to analyze the optimal dose needed and arrived at the nal dose for the study in rats described earlier. 7.8. Discussions on PolyHb-T yrosinase and T yrosinase Articial Cells Meadow's group show that tyrosine and phenylalanine restricted diets reduce the growth of melanoma and increase the survival of B16melanoma-bearing mice (Meadow and Oeser, 1983; Fu Regenerative... ch07 FA 186 Articial Cells One of the main problems with these low amino acids diets is that they cause nausea, vomiting and malnutrition as well as weight loss inthe severely ill patients. We showed that daily intravenous injectionof PolyHb-tyrosinase can retard the growth of melanoma in micewithout having the adverse effects of vomiting and weight loss oftyrosine restricted diet. Furthermore, the use of PolyHb-tyrosinase canreduce the plasma asparagines level to 15% as compared with 62%for tyrosine restricted diet. To avoid the need for daily intravenous injections, we have also studied the use of oral tyrosinase articial cells. Oral administrationdoes not have an adverse effect on the growth and body weight ofthe animal. It can effectively lower the systemic tyrosine in animals,but takes a longer time to reach a low level. By rst giving one ortwo intravenous injections of nano PolyHb-tyrosinase articial tyrosinase articial cells, the plasma tyrosinelevel can be quickly lowered and maintained. These results encouragefurther studies to achieve futher optimization and to investigate thecombined use of this approach with other methods like radiation andchemotherapy for treating malignant melanoma. The same adverse effects of nausea, vomiting and weight loss are also encountered when using diet restriction in attempts tolower the systemic tyrosine in hypertyrosinemia, an inborn error ofmetabolism (Russo, Mitchell and Tanguay, 2001). Oral tyrosinasearticial cells could be tested for the lowering of systemic tyrosinein hypertyrosinemia. 7.9. Enzyme Articial Cells for Activating Prodrugs ranks fth in cancer-related death (G\u00a8 unzburg and Salmons, 2001). Few of these can be treated surgically,furthermore, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are not effective.Ifosfamide is 2B1 (CYP2B1) into4-hydroxyifosfamide containing genetic engineered with cytochrome 450 (Lohr et al, 2001) 4-hydroxyifosfamide phosphoramide mustard & Act on pancreatic CACYTOCHROME 450CYTOCHROME 450 Fig. 7.15. containing genetically cells expressing PRO-DRUG-activating cytochrome P450 have been administered intra-artierially to lodged in pancreatic carcinoma (Lorh et al. , 2001). Here they activate the prodrug ifosfamide into its active form locally, thus reducingsystemic toxicity. pancreatic carcinoma. Unfortunately, they have a short plasma half-life and the high dose of ifosfamide needed is not well tolerated (G\u00a8 unzburg and Salmons, 2001). Articial cells containing genetically modiedcells expressing PRO-DRUG-activating enzymes, such as cytochromeP450, have been studied as a potential treatment for inoperablepancreatic carcinoma in patients (Lorh et al. , 2001) (Fig. 7.15). These articial cells are administered intra-arterially, to accumulate in thepancreatic carcinoma, where they activate the prodrug, ifosfamide. Asa result, the local concentration of the activated ifosfamide is muchhigher than in the rest of the body, thus reducing systemic toxicity andincreasing local efcacy. Clinical trial results Lohr et al. (2001) encapsulated human cells transfected with a CYP2B1-expression contruct Cells immunorejection (Fig. 7.15). The prodrug, ifosfamide, can diffuse rapidly into the articial cells to be converted into the active form. They carried out a phase I/II study in 14 patients with inoperable pancreatic CA (stages III-IV 86% Stage IV). The typical dose theygave was 250-300 articial cells (cellulose sulphate membrane) witha mean diameter of 0 \u00b78 mm. Each articial cell contains 10 4cells. These are administered angiographically into one of the arteries that supply the pancreatic CA. This is followed on the second day by low-dose (1 g/m 2body surface) ifosfamide in 250 ml 0 \u00b79% sodium chloride given on 3 consecutive days. This regimen is repeated on days 23-25.In this way, the articial cells are trapped in the tumor and can locallyactivate ifosfamide to give a high local concentration of the activateddrug in the tumor. This method proves to be effective in treating thetumor and the low dose of ifosfamide needed means that there is lesssystemic toxic effect in the rest of the body. Follow-up angiography ofthe tumor vessels after the infusion of the articial cells showed noor only minor changes and there was no arterial occlusion. Of the 12patients who remained in the study, after 10 months two had more than50% reduction in tumor volume and two had 25-50% reduction. Thetumor size of the other eight patients did not increase and remainedstable at 75-125% of the initial size. Median survival was doubledin the treatment group as compared with historic controls, and one-year survival rate was three times better. They concluded that furtherstudies of this approach combined with chemotherapy for inoperablepancreatic cancer are warranted. 7.10. Materials and Methods Asparaginase articial cells Nylon membrane articial cells containing asparaginase wereprepared as follows: 1260 IU of the enzyme is dissolved in 1.5 mlof a 10 gm% hemoglobin (hemoglobin substrate, Worthington Co.)solution. To the 1.5 ml enzyme solution in a 100 ml beakeris added an equal volume of a freshly prepared alkaline 1,6-hexamethylenediamine solution (an aqueous 1.6 gm% sodium bicarbonate, and 6.6 gm% sodium carbonate). Immediately uponmixing the two solutions in a 100 ml beaker, the subsequent stepsfor the preparation of 80 \u00b5mean diameter nylon articial cells as described in Appendix II are carried out. Only properly preparedarticial cells which do not show any leakage of enzymes are usedin these experiments. Control articial cells are prepared in exactlythe same way, except that asparaginase has not been added to thehemoglobin solution. Collodion membrane articial cells containing asparaginase were prepared as follows: 1260 units of the enzyme was dissolved in3 ml of a 10 gm% hemoglobin (hemoglobin substrate, WorthingtonCo.) solution. The remaining steps for the preparation of collodionmembrane articial cells as described in Appendix II were carried out. PolyHb-tyrosinase in melanoma Preparation of PolyHb-tyrosinase Puried bovine hemoglobin is purchased from Corporation(Boston, MA, activity) are purchasedfrom Sigma-Aldrich (Ontario, Canada). All other reagents are ofanalytical grade. For the preparation of PolyHb-tyrosinase, reaction mixtures are prepared containing hemoglobin (10 g/dl) and tyrosinase (6000 U/ml)in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6. To prepare PolyHb, anequivalent volume of buffer is used instead of the enzyme. Prior tothe start of crosslinking, 1.3 M lysine is added at a molar ratio of 7:1lysine/hemoglobin. Crosslinking reaction is started with the addition ofglutaraldehyde (5%) at molar ratio of 16:1 glutaraldehyde/hemoglobin.Glutaraldehyde is added in four equal aliquots over a period of15 min. After 3.5 to 48 h at 4 C under aerobic conditions with constant stirring, the reaction is stopped by adding 2.0 M lysineat a molar ratio of 200:1 lysine/hemoglobin. The Cells dialyzed passed Aliquots (500 \u00b5l) of the 100 KD microconcentrators (Amicon, Beverly,MA, USA). Samples are centrifuged at 2500 g for 55 min at 23 C.Then, the retentate is collected. Hemoglobin concentration is determined bycyanomethemoglobin at 540 nm. Determination of tyrosinase activity Tyrosinase activity is assessed by measuring the formation of enzymatic products at 300 nm. The adsorbance at 300 nm is monitored con-tinuously for 8-14 min using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 4Bspectrophotometer, and changes in O.D./min are used to analyze theactivity of the enzyme. Effects of intravenous injection of PolyHb-tyrosinase in rats Fasted male Sprague-Dawley rats (245-260 g) are obtained fromCharles River Canada (St-Constant, Quebec, Canada). The animals areanaesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of 65 mg/kg pentobarbital(Somnotol, Decton Dickinson, NJ, USA). The rats' body temperature ismaintained using a warming blanket. Incisions are carefully performedin one side of the hindlimbs below the inguinal ligament, and thefemoral vessels are carefully isolated. Polyethylene cannulae areinserted and secured distal to the supercial epigastric branches in thefemoral veins (PE-10, PE-50 Clay Adams). Proper vessel access is testedwith a small volume injection of heparinized saline (50 IU/ml). Bloodsamples are taken from each group at the beginning, then the samplesare injected through the femoral vein. The femoral artery cannulae isconnected to the venous cannulae for blood to circulate thoroughlyfor a short interval. Then blood samples are taken from the femoralartery at different time intervals. The plasma in each blood sample isseparated from the blood and placed in a 1.5 ml plastic tube, thenstored at 80 C until analyzed. The tyrosine concentration in plasma is analyzed by fluorometric method using Perkin Elmer LuminescenceSpectrometer LS50B.April 2, culture conditions B16-F10 murine melanoma cells are obtained from American Type Tissue Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). The tumor cells are cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies, Invitrogen Canada) supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells are passaged every 2-3 days. For the experiment,melanoma cells are cultured in complete DMEM until they become30-40% confluent.Then, appropriate aliquots of different test solutions(0.57 ml sample per 10 ml medium) are added to the medium. Thecell viability is followed up to 4 days thereafter. Tumor cells aremonitored by phase microscopy. Cell counts are obtained daily using ahemacytometer. Cell viability is determined by trypan blue exclusion. Intravenous injection of PolyHb-tyrosinase in normal mice BD2F1 female mice (C57BL/6 \u00d7DBA/2F1) at age 57-63 days are purchased from Charles River Canada (St-Constant, Quebec, Canada). The mice are kept at a 12-h light interval and fed conventional food and water ad libitum . All the animals are housed and cared for according to the regulations of McGill University on Animal Care. All the miceare acclimatized for at least 7 days prior to use. Two groups of mice (5mice per group) are studied. Intravenous injection of saline at 0.1 ml forthe control group is carried out every day; 0.1 ml of PolyHb-tyrosinasesolution is injected into the mice in the test group every day, and bloodis drawn after each injection from both groups. B16F10 melanoma bearing mice model B16F10 melanoma cells prepared at 1 \u00d7106in 0.1 ml of HBSS are injected subcutaneously into shaved lateral flank of the mice.The sizesof primary tumors are measured every 2 days using calipers. Tumorvolume is calculated using the formula V=(A\u00d7B 2)/2, where Vis volume (mm3),Ais long diameter (mm) and Bis short diameter (mm). We start intravenous injection at day 9 after tumor implantation when the tumors reach an average size of 125 mm3. The end point of study is when the tumor in any group of animal reaches 10% of the bodyweight. This is based on the regulations of the ethics committee ofthe Faculty of Medicine Animal Care Committee of McGill University.April 2, 2007 Regenerative... ch07 Articial Cells Statistical analysis is performed using Student's t-test within ANOVA and considered signicant at P<0.05. Tyrosinase from mushroom (EC. 1.14.18.1, 5350 units/mg stated activity), and hemoglobin from bovine (lyophilized powder) arepurchased from Sigma Company (Oakville, Ontario, Canada).Collodion is purchased from Fisher Scientic Company (Whitby,Ontario, Canada). All other reagents are of analytical grade. Control articial cells These are prepared using the standard published method as described in Appendix II for collodion membrane articial cells. Briefly, 1 ghemoglobin and 200 mg Tris are added to 10 ml double distilleddeionized water and stirred until dissolved. Gravity lter the solutionthrough a Waterman #42 lter Take hemoglobin microencapsulatedwithin cellulose nitrate membrane articial cells asdescribed II. All the control articial cells are prepareddaily and stored in 1% v/v Tween 20 solution at 4 C until use. Tyrosinase articial cells 1.907 mg of 5350 units/mg tyrosinase is dissolved in 5 ml 10%hemoglobin solution; then the methods described above to immobilizetyrosinase in collodion membrane articial cells as a 50% suspensionis followed. Before oral administration, the control articial cells and tyrosinase articial cells are washed and resuspended in 0.1 M Tris\u00b7HClbuffer (pH 8.5). The total volume of articial cells for feeding is 1 ml,containing tyrosinase 1020 U/ml. This is suspended in 1.5 ml Tris\u00b7 HCl buffer. This buffer is needed to protect the microencapsulated tyrosinase during its their passage through the stomach with itsacidic medium. For the in vitro studies, three types of tyrosinaseApril 2, 2007 15:21 SPI-B446 Cells 193 microcapsules are prepared, with tyrosinase concentration of 450 U/ml, 670 U/ml, and 900 U/ml. In vitro studies using rat intestinal juice Fasted male Sprague-Dawley rats (245-260 g) purchased fromCharles River (St. Constant, Quebec, Canada) are anesthetizedwith intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (Somnotol, 65 mg/kg). The whole length of the small intestine is removed intact with a surgical scissor. The contents are gently expressed into polypropylenecentrifuge tubes stored on ice. These tubes are centrifuged at 1500 gfor 10 min at 4 C, and the supernatant is recovered for the following experiment. Control articial cells or tyrosinase articial cells atdifferent concentration of 450 670 U/ml, and 900 U/ml areincubated with the rats' intestine juice at 37 C, and then the samples are taken at different time intervals. Then, 10% trichloroacetic acid(TCA) is added to stop the reaction. After centrifuging the sample,the tyrosine level in the supernatant is measured by the fluorometricmethod using Perkin Elmer Luminescence Spectrometer LS50B. Animal studies Fasted male Sprague-Dawley rats (130-150 g) are used in this study. They are kept in a controlled 12-h light/dark environment with food and water ad libitum . All the rats are acclimatized for at least 3 days prior to use. All the animal experiments are performed according to theregulations of the McGill University on Animal Care.Two groups (5 ratsin each group) are studied: 1) control group: each rat receiving oraladministration of articial cells containing no enzyme; 2) test group:each rat receiving oral administration of articial cells loaded withtyrosinase. In the following experiments, a blood sample is taken at 4:00 pm on day 0. No articial cells are administrated on that day. From thatday on, for daily dosing, articial cells are given at 10:00 am usingstomach feeding tubes. Blood samples are taken six hours after oraladministration of the articial cells every two days. The procedures forblood collection from the lateral saphenous vein are as follows. First,April 2, 2007 Regenerative... ch07 FA 194 Articial Cells the animal is placed in a restrainer. Then, the hind leg is extended and the limb is xed by holding fold of skin between tail and thigh. Thehair on outer surface of lower hind leg is shaved to visualize the vein. Vaseline is applied on skin prior to nick to prevent wicking of blood onto skin and to ease collection. The vein is nicked perpendicularlywith a 25-gauge needle and the blood sample (about 1 ml) is collectedby microhematocrit (capillary) tube. The plasma in each blood sampleis separated from the blood and placed in a 1.5 ml plastic tube, thenstored at 80 C until analyzed for tyrosine concentration. For twice daily dosing, articial cells are given at 10:00 am and 4:00 pm, andblood samples are taken every week (day 7, 14 and 21) just before thesecond feeding for 21 days. For three times daily dosing, articial cellsare administrated at 10:00 am, 2:00 pm, and 6:00 pm for 22 days.Blood samples are taken on day 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, and 22 just after thesecond feeding. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1S.D.

Introduction Different attempts have been made, with the use of membrane systems, to prevent rejection of transplanted cells by the immune system. Theseinclude the use of dialysers, ultraltrators, membrane sacs, membranedisks and polymeric devices. However, in these congurations, one ofthe major problems is low cell viability due to the low permeabilityto oxygen and nutrients. As early as 1964 (Chang, 1964) Changsuccessfully used articial cells to bioencapsulate cells via a dropmethod. He suggested that in addition to protecting the enclosed cellsfrom immunorejection, these articial cells also provide a high surface-to-volume relationship, which allows for good mass transfer of oxygenand nutrients (Chang, 1964, 1965, 1972; Chang et al., 1966) (Fig. 8.1). The following quotations come from a 1965 publication by Chang: \"..... microencapsulation of intact cells or tissue fragments ...t h e enclosed material might be protected from destruction and fromparticipation in immunological processes, while the enclosingmembrane would be permeable to small molecules of specic cellularproduct which could then enter the general extracellular compartmentof the recipient. For instance, articial cell bioencapsulated endocrinecells might survive and maintain an effective supply of hormone. The situation would then be comparable to that of a graft placed in an immunologically favorable site.\" ...\"There would be the further advantage that implantation could be accomplished by a simpleinjection procedure rather than by a surgical operation.\" 195April 2, Articial Cells Fig. 8.1. Basic principles of articial cells containing cells, tissues, genetically engineered cells, stem cells and microorganisms for therapeutic uses.April 2, 2007 15:42 SPI-B446 Articial Cells for Cell Encapsulation 197 The method is based on the extension of the drop technique described in Chapter 1 (Chang, 1957). For the encapsulation ofcells inside articial cells, a hemoglobin solution containing cellsis added dropwise to a silicone liquid containing a diacid, sebacylchloride. The hydrophobic diacid crosslinks hemoglobin only at form a membrane by interfacial polymerization and theencapsulated cells in the resulting articial cells thereby remainintact (Fig. 2.5) (Chang, 1964, 1965, 1972a; Chang et al. , 1966). \"Microencapsulation of intact cells . . . erythrocytes were suspended in hemolysate ...; a n d a silicone oil was substituted for the stock organic liquid. Microencapsulation was then carried out. . . based onthe hemolysate within a microcapsule of 500 \u00b5diameter was prepared by the syringe [drop] method.\" However, there was not much interest in biotechnology in the 1960s and it is only with the more recent interest in biotechnology thatmany groups around the world have extended the author's approach ofcell encapsulation. Thus, when Chang rst approached the ConnaughtLaboratories in Canada to ask them to develop his microencapsulationmethod for use in diabetic patients there was not much interest.Conaught Laboratories later assigned the project to Dr. Sun and theyhave since extended Chang's original drop-method by using milderphysical crosslinking to prepare alginate-polylysine-alginate [APA]microcapsules containing cells (Lim and Sun, 1980). They showed thatafter implantation, the islets inside articial cells remain viable andcontinued to secrete insulin to control the glucose levels in diabetic rats. Recent reviews show that many groups are now developing articial cells to encapsulate biological cells for cell therapy (Kulitreibezet al. , 1999; Orive et al. encapsulation of endocrine tissues, hepatocytes and other cells forcell therapy. More recently, there have been much interests in theuse of articial cells to bioencapsulate genetically engineered cellsfor potential in lateral Articial Regenerative... ch08 198 Articial Cells been studying the use of articial cells to encapsulate stem cells for use in liver regeneration. A 2003 consensus paper in Nature Medicine from several leading groups around the world (Orive et al. , 2003) shows that there has been increasing realization of the potential of cellencapsulation with polymeric articial cells in recent years. Indeed,cell-based products, including cells with synthetic biomaterials, arenow being recognized as a new category of therapeutic products by theUS Pharmacopeia and National Formulation (US Pharmacopeia andNational Formulary, 2002). Despite all the promising results, it shouldbe emphasized that further developments will be needed before thisapproach is ready for actual routine clinical applications. As summarized in Table 8.1, articial cells for bioencapsulation of biological cells is a very large area of research that includes articialcells containing 1) islets, liver cells, endocrine cells and others;2) genetically engineered cells; 3) stem cells; and 4) microorganisms(Fig. 8.1). A detailed description of this area will require at leastone large multi-author book and cannot be done in this monographalone. This chapter contains an overview of the therapeutic uses ofarticial cell encapsulated cells, including discussions of the potentialapplication as well as problems. Examples of the detailed proceduresfor bioencapsulation of biological cells inside articial cells areincluded at the end of this chapter. 8.2. Articial Cells Containing Islets, Liver Cells, Endocrine Cells and Others Articial cells containing islets The largest effort in this area is the use of articial cells to encapsulate islets for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. As mentioned above, werst put forward the idea of using polymeric cells to encapsulate cellsfor transplantation (in particular, islet cells) (Chang, 1964, 1965, 1972;Chang et al. , 1966) (Figs. 2.5, 8.1) and thereby to protect them from immune rejection. The author approached the Conaught Laboratories(of insulin fame) to develop his idea of encapsulation of islets forthe treatment of diabetes.

When implanted into diabetic rats, articial cell encapsulated islets corrected the diabetic state for several weeks (Lim and Sun, 1980). Intheir experiments, Lim and colleagues used a modication of Chang'sdrop technique and instead of chemically crosslinking protein to formthe membrane, they used a milder electrostatic crosslinking of alginateand polylysine. Since 1980, many groups have been investigating the approach or extensions of the approach for islets. The results in animals seempromising and the implanted islets function for up to one year (Sunet al. , 1996; Calaore et 2001; Cruise et al. , 1999). A typical result of animal studies is shown in Fig. 8.2. A clinical trial in a patient withtype 1 diabetes by Soon-Shiong's group has shown that the procedureis safe and without side effects (Soon-Shiong et al. , 1994). However, efcacy studies using larger amounts of articial cell encapsulatedislets have not yet been carried out. This is because there are a number Spontaneous NOD diabetic mice Artificial cells containing procine islets (typical results from many groups) Time (weeks)11 1Blood glucose (mM/L)20 0 Fig. 8.2.

These challenges are so importantthat they will be discussed in detail in a later section. Articial cells containing hepatocytes Articial cells containing hepatocytes have been used as a model for cell and gene therapy (Wong and Chang, 1986, 1988; Kashani andChang, 1991; Bruni and encapsulated hepatocytes increases thesurvival of rats with fulminant hepatic failure (Wong and Chang, 1986). Articial cell encapsulated rat hepatocytes, after implantation into mice are not rejected; instead, there is an increase in viability afterintraperitoneal implantation (Wong and Chang, 1986), owing to theretention of hepato-stimulating factors inside the microcapsules as theyare secreted by the hepatocytes (Kashani and Chang, 1991). The Gunn rat is the model for the Crigler-Najjar syndrome in humans, the disease being is due to defects in the liver enzymeUDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT). Intraperitoneal implantationof articial cells containing hepatocytes lowered the high systemicbilirubin levels that are characteristic of this condition (Bruni andChang, 1989, 1991). UDPGT that excreted inthe urine, as in normal animals (Bruni and Chang, 1995). The most promising use of articial cell encapsulated hepatocytes is for short-term \"bridging\" in acute liver failure, as a liver supportto allow the patient's own liver to regenerate and carry out itsfunction. This will be described in the next chapter under regenerativemedicine. However, this approach will probably have to be combinedwith hemoperfusion to rst remove the large amount of toxins andproducts released by the breakdown of the acutely damaged liver.Hemoperfusion has already been successfully used for removing thesematerials in fulminant hepatic failure, resulting in the recovery ofconsciousness of patients from hepatic coma (Chang, 1972a; Gazzardet al. , 1974). It is only after the removal of hepatic toxins that the implanted articial cell encapsulated Articial Cells for Cell Encapsulation 203 function to keep the patient alive, in the hope that the liver can regenerate sufciently to assume normal function (Legallais et al. , 2001; Allen et al. , 2001). Other areas Other areas of research have focused on the microencapsulation of erythropoietin (EPO)-secreting renal cells to treat anemia (Koo andChang, 1993), and parathyroid cells for secreting parathyroid hormoneto treat hypoparathyroidism (Hasse et al., 1997). However, in these two cases, one would want to compare these approaches with standardhormone replacement therapy with respect to cost-effective. 8.3. Challenges of Articial Cell Encapsulated Cells in Therapy Availability of cells A key challenge for the approaches described above is the availability of human cells (allogeneic cells) for use in encapsulation. Some haveproposed the use of xenogeneic cells from nonhuman sources, asthe polymeric membrane can exclude leukocytes and antibodies,resulting in immune protection (Chang, 1965, 1972a; Chang et al. , 1966; Sun et al. , 1996; Lacy et al. , 1991). In allografts using human cells, immune mechanisms are mainly mediated by Tlymphocyte sub-populations (i.e., CD8 +) with donor cells. So, the physical isolation provided by the capsules should prevent cell-to-cell contact between the articial cell encapsulated tissue and thehost's immune system. However, one group has carried out researchthat indicates that both xenografts and allografts might provoke aninflammatory cell response (de Vos et al. , 2003). They proposed that cells in capsules produce proteins, which can provoke inflammatoryresponses in immune cells, and that this even occurs with isografts. Another possibility is that the immune response is due to the use of the standard method for cell encapsulation, resulting in theoccasional cells protruding on to the surface of the articial cellsApril 2, 2007 204 Articial Cells (Wong and Chang, 1991a); the use of the two-step method to prevent cell extrusion seems to prevent this problem (Wong and Chang, 1991b;Liu and Chang, 2002, 2003). This will be discussed in a later section. In xenografts using non-human cells, there are other factors involved, including antibodies, complement fractions and cytokines(de Vos et al. , 2003; Hunkeler et al. , 2001). Proteins and other therapeutic factors secreted by xenografts, unlike those secreted by allografts, might result in immunological problems in the long term. If this should prove to be the case, then it would mean that onlyhuman cells can be used. The method involving xenogenic cellsmay require the use of a membrane with very limited permeability(Schuldt and Hunkeler, 2000; Uludag et al., 2000; Dionne et al., 1996). In this regard, our group uses chromatography to study variationsin microcapsule membrane composition on the diffusion of largermolecules (Coromili and Chang, 1993). Other groups (Omer et al. , 2003; Binette et shown neonatal porcine islets, which are far less immunogeneic than the adultcounterpart, could be used to lessen the problems related to xenografts.Moreover, the support mechanisms consisting of either cells, orpharmacological agents coencapsulated with xeno cells, might helpto attenuate the xenoimmune problem. However, there are also othersources of cells, such as genetically engineered cells and stem cells asdescribed below. Mass transfer, biocompatibility and stability Many groups are looking into optimizing the biocompatibility, masstransfer, stability, and reproducibility of polymeric Gill and Ballesteros, 2000). Long-term biocompatibility is very important, as foreign-body reaction with resulting brous reactionwill decrease the mass transfer of oxygen, nutrients and metabolitesand result in the death of the articial cell encapsulated cells. Inaddition, much work is being done to investigate the structural-functional relationship and other aspects in an attempt to increasethe long-term stability of the polymeric articial cells, and to ensureApril 2, 2007 for Cell Encapsulation 205 There are a number of commercial machines for automatic production, resulting in muchimproved reproducibility and narrower size distribution, as seen inthe articial cells that we have prepared using one such machine(Fig. 8.3). Cell protrusion or entrapment in articial cell membrane However, improving the reproducibility, biocompatibility and strengthof the polymeric membrane might not be enough. The standardalginate-polylysine-alginate membrane articial cells containing cellsare based on the following. Alginates are heteropolymer carboxylicacids, coupled by glycosidic bonds of -D-mannuronic (M) and - L-gluronic acid unit (G). Alkali and magnesium alginate are solublein water, whereas alginic acids and the salts of polyvalent metalcations are insoluble. Thus, when a drop of sodium alginate solutioncontaining a cell suspension enters a calcium chloride solution, rigidspherical gels are formed by ionotrotpic gelation (Fig. 8.3).The cells aredispersed randomly throughout the gel spheres, including some nearor at the surface. When polylysine is added, it physically crosslinkedalginate on the surface to form a polylysine-alginate membrane.However, during this process those cells near to or on the surfacemay protrude out of the membrane as it is formed. In the nal step,sodium citrate is added and the gel sphere is liqueed, and the entirearticial cell is now supported only by the membrane. When usingthe standard method to encapsulate high concentrations of cells, evenwith automatic production, some cells are exposed on the surfaceor entrapped in the membrane matrix (Fig. 8.3) (Wong and Chang,1991a). Entrapment of cells in the membranes weakens the membrane,resulting in breakage with time after implantation, thus releasing thecontents of the articial cells. In those cases when cells are exposedon the surface, they would not be immunoisolated and the rejectionprocess would involve not only the exposed cells, but the wholearticial cells (Fig. 8.3).April 2, 2007 Regenerative... ch08 FA 206 Articial Cells Fig. 8.3. Standard drop method of preparing articial cells to encapsulate cells results in weakening of the membrane and exposure of cells, resultingin immuno-rejection. New 2-step method solves Articial Cells for Cell Encapsulation 207 Method to prevent cell protrusion or entrapment in articial cell membrane For encapsulation of high concentrations of small cells, we have designed a two-step method (Fig. 8.3) (Wong and Chang, 1991b),which should be particularly useful for the encapsulation ofhepatocytes and genetically engineered cells. This method involvesrst forming very small alginate gel microspheres containing cells(Fig. 8.3). These small microspheres are then enclosed in larger gelmicrospheres. In this way, there will be no cells on the surface ofthe larger gel spheres. As a result of this, no cells will be trapped inthe alginate-polylysine-alginate membrane when it is formed aroundeach larger gel microspheres. The small alginate gel microspheresas well as the larger gel microspheres are then dissolved to releasethe cells, allowing them to be freely suspended in the articial cells. Thus, the cells are dispersed freely inside the articial cells, and so an extra diffusion barrier's avoided (Fig. 8.3). The exact procedure canbe found at the end of this chapter under \"Method\". Detailed studiescomparing this approach to the standard methods show that with thisapproach, protrusion of cells as well as local invasion of inflammatorycells are avoided, and the viability of the implanted cells is prolonged(Fig. 8.3) (Wong and Chang, 1991b; Liu and Chang, 2002; 2003).Others have attempted to use our earlier technology of enclosingsmaller microcapsules in larger microcapsules (Fig. 2.4) (Chang, 1965,1972; Chang et al., 1966) or to use a double coating for the membrane. However, these approaches add further diffusion barriers. Other improvements to microencapsulation method One group has developed a promising approach of coating isletsdirectly with a polymer membrane (Kulitreibez et al. , 1999). This would result in an articial cell with a minimal diameter, thus allowingfor optimal diffusion. Many other extensions and modications ofthe original method have also been studied, including the use ofdifferent types of membrane materials (Kulitreibez et al., 1999). Further technologies include the use of electrostatic devices (Halle et al. ,April 2, 2007 15:42 SPI-B446 Articial Cells: Biotechnology, JetCutter technology (Schwinger et al. , 2002). The use of high voltage electrostatic pulses can produce much smaller alginate microcapsules(less than 300 microns). The smaller microcapsules would allow forbetter mass transfer than the larger ones (Halle et al. , 1994). The. emulsication/thermal gelation method (Raymond et al., 2004) can be used to prepare large batches of microcapsules. This helps to solve the problem faced by most of the present cell encapsulation methods that involve variations of the drop approach that is very laborious whenproducing large batches of microcapsules. The JetCutter technology(Schwinger et al. , 2002) is another approach to solving the problem of the standard drop technique and it can produce larger batches withgreater ease. Capillary ber cell encapsulation Implantation of articial cell encapsulated cells for extended periodsis a long-term aim, but several groups are looking into othercongurations for more immediate clinical applications. For example, Aebischer's ingenious use of capillary bers to encapsulate cells has allowed his group to insert these subcutaneously into the cerebralspinal fluid on a short-term basis, and to remove and renew thebers (Aebischer et al., 1996). This would prevent the problem related to permanent retention of genetically engineered cells and othereffects of long-term implantation. However, the ber encapsulationand insertion approach is not applicable to conditions that requirelarge amounts of articial cell encapsulated cells, as is the case forislets and hepatocytes. Oral administration Another approach that does not require implantation or insertion is oral administration of articial cells (Chang, 1972a, 1974f, 1997l,2005l; Chang and Prakash, 1996). However, this is only for use incertain conditions, e.g., in the removal of unwanted metabolites fromthe body as in the removal of phenylalanine 2, 2007 Cell Encapsulation 209 removal hypoxanthine in Lesch-Nyhan Disease, removal of tyrosine in melanoma and removal of uremic waste metabolites in kidneyfailure. For oral administration, very strong polymeric membranes thatwill not break down in the presence of powerful digestive enzymesin the intestine are needed and are being developed (Chen et al. , 2006). Furthermore, a buffer should be added to the oral formulationto protect the enclosed cells during their passage through the acidicenvironment of the stomach. There are other requirements neededfor the most optimal use of oral administration and this is beingstudied (Chen et al. , 2006) As with all medical therapies, different conditions will require different types of approaches for the use ofarticial cell encapsulated cells \u2014 either implantation, insertion ororal administration, as appropriate. 8.4. Articial Cells Containing Genetically- engineered Cells General Cells can be genetically engineered outside the body to fulll very specialized and specic functions. However, use of cells from thesame person (autologous cells) is too individualized and thus notsuitable for scale-up production. The use of cells from other humans(allogeneic cells) is more suitable for scale-up production, but thisrequires the use of drugs to suppress immunological rejection. Asa result, there has been much ongoing research interest in the useof articial cells containing genetically engineered cells (Table 8.1). Thus, the genetically engineered cells are immunoisolated, but oxygen and nutrients can enter, and the therapeutic agents from the cellscan diffuse out to carry out their function in the body (Fig. 8.1).Examples of the use of articial cells containing genetically engineeredcells are: 1) for conditions requiring growth hormone, monoclonalantibodies, factor XI, or erythropoietin; 2) some Cells Growth hormone, monoclonal antibodies, factor XI, erythropoietin Articial cell encapsulated mouse broblasts with a human growth hormone (hGH) fusion gene continue to secrete and deliverhuman growth hormone (hGH) when implanted into animals in ananimal model of dwarsm (Al-Hendy et al. , signicant increases insurvival mice (Okada et al. , 1997). Articial cell encapsulated genetically engineered mouse myoblasts that secretehuman factor XI have also been studied for potential use inhemophilia B (Basic et al., 1996). Articial cell encapsulated myoblasts have been used to deliver erythropoietin in mouse thalasemia (Dalleet al. , 1999). Neurological disorders Neurological disorders represent a potentially exciting area for the therapeutic application of polymeric articial cells. For example,articial cell encapsulated neuro2A cells containing the propio-melanocortin gene that released endorphin, when injected into thecerebral spinal fluid of rats, decreased sensitivity to pain (Saitohet al. , 1995; Hagihara et al. , 1997). In another example, articial cell encapsulated cells that secreted human nerve growth factor promotedthe survival of axotomized septal cholinergic neurons (Winn et al. , 1994). An extension of the principle of polymeric articial cellsinvolves the preparation of polymeric hollow bers instead of sphericalpolymeric membrane articial cells. An example of this approachis the use of articial cell encapsulated baby hamster kidney (BHK)cells that contain the gene for human or mouse ciliary neurotrophicfactor (CNTF), for the treatment of the neurodegenerative disease,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Aebischer et al. , 1996). Other examples (Emerich et al., 1997; Block et al., 2004; Bachoud-Levi et al., 2000) are highlighted in Table 8.1.April 2, 2007 15:42 SPI-B446 Articial Cells for Cell Encapsulation 211 In the case of Huntington's disease, a phase I clinical trial was carried out using a semipermeable membrane encapsulating a BHKcell line engineered to synthesize and release CNTF (Bloch et al. , 2004). The membrane was implanted into the right lateral ventricleof six subjects with stage 1 or 2 Huntington's disease. It was retrievedand exchanged for a new one every 6 months, over a period of twoyears. Improvements in electrophysiological results were observed,and the results were correlated with the amount of CNTF released. Thegroup reported that this phase I study showed the safety, feasibility, andtolerability of this gene therapy procedure. They also stressed the needto improve on the technique as although all retrieved capsules wereintact, they contained variable numbers of surviving cells, and CNTFrelease was low in 13 of 24 implants. Tumors There has also been much recent interest in the potential use of polymeric articial cells containing genetically modied cells for thetreatment of tumors (Read et al. , 2001; Joki , Cirone et al., Lorh et al., 2001). example, articial cell encapsulated genetically modied cells expressing pro-drug-activatingenzymes, such as cytochrome P450, have been studied as a potentialtreatment for inoperable pancreatic carcinoma in patients (Lorh et al., 2001). The articial cell encapsulated cells are given intra-arteriallyso that they are located in the pancreatic carcinoma where theyactivate the drug ifosfamide. Therefore the local concentration of theactivated ifosfamide is much higher than in the rest of the body, thusminimizing systemic toxicity and increasing local efcacy. Articialcell encapsulated transfected cells that secrete the anti-angiogenicfactor endostatin have also been found to show promise in animalmodels of malignant brain tumors. Another approach involves on polymeric articial cells containing genetically modied myoblast cells that secrete interleukin-2 linkedto the Fv region of a humanized antibody with afnity to tumorsoverexpressing the oncogene ERBB2 (Xu et al. , 2002). Regulatory agencies are more likely to approve clinical trials for the use ofApril 2, 2007 15:42 SPI-B446 Articial Regenerative... ch08 FA 212 Articial Cells genetically engineered cells for conditions that have no other effective treatments. Malignant tumor that has no available effective therapyis one typical example. Thus, as discussed above, clinical trials ininoperable pancreatic carcinoma in patients have been carried out(Lorh et al. , 2001). Another example is the use of articial cell encapsulated transfected cells that secrete endostatin for malignantbrain tumors (Xu et al., 2002). This is another case that would be more likely approved for clinical trials in patients. Discussions The research described above has shown that polymeric articial cells containing genetically modied cells have potential use in treatmentof tumors. However, further research is needed to study the long-termsafety and effects in order to address regulatory concerns regardingthe use of any products containing genetically modied cells. Untilthen, regulatory agencies would be relunctant to approve clinical trialsof genetically engineered cells in humans unless there is no othertreatment available. Malignant tumors that have no available treatmentare therefore better candidates for this approach. 8.5. Articial Cells Containing Stem Cells More recently, there has been much interest in the use of stemcells for therapy (Alison et al. , 2002; McNeisch, 2004) as they can differentiate into different types of cells. Allogeneic stem cells stillrequire immunoprotection inside polymeric articial cells, but wouldavoid problems related to xenografts. However, at present, the amountof stem cells that can be harvested for large-scale use is still limited. There has also been considerable controversy regarding the use of fetal stem cells. We have therefore investigated the use of adult bonemarrow cells. For instance, in order to increase the duration of the viability and function of articial cell encapsulated hepatocytes after implantation,we have co-encapsulated hepatocytes with bone marrow stem cells(Liu and Chang, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2006a, 2006b). This 2, Articial Cells for Cell Encapsulation 213 increased viability of the hepatocytes both in vitro and in vivo (Liu and Chang, 2000, 2002). This has also a signicantly longer effecton lowering of the high systemic bilirubin levels in congenital Gunnrats (Liu and Chang, 2003). The exact reason for this effect has to befurther investigated. However, it is known that bone marrow stemscells in the presence of hepatocytes can differentiate into hepatocytes(Alison et al. , 2000). Furthermore, it has been proposed that bone marrow stem cells secrete a factor that can help maintain the viability of the coencapsulated hepatocytes (Liu and Chang, 2000, 2006b). Evenmore recently we studied the use of articial cells containing onlybone marrow stems and no hepatocytes (Liu and Chang, 2005, 2006a,2006c). In hepatectomized rats with 90% of their liver resected, oneintraperitoneal injection of these articial cells resulted in recoveryof the animal and regeneration of the liver (Liu and Chang, 2005,2006a, 2006c). However, in the control groups, most of the animalsdid not recover. In those receiving one injection of free bone marrowstem cells, the results were not signicantly different from the groupthat did not receive any injection. Our analysis showed that the stemcells encapsulated within articial cells stayed in the peritoneal cavitywhere they secrete a hapato-growth factor that drain into the portalcirculation to stimulate the regeneration of the resected livers in therats. On the other hand, the free bone marrow stem cells were shown todisappear quickly from the peritoneal cavity.The next chapter containsa detailed description of the use of articial cells containing bonemarrow stem cells in the treatment of liver failure. 8.6. Articial Cells Containing Microorganisms Another area is the study of articial cells containing nonpathogenic microorganisms, including genetically engineered microorganisms. We have encapsulated in articial cells a NADH oxidizing bacterium for the repeated recycling of NAD to NADH (Fig. 8.4) (Erganand Chang, 1984). Another study involved the encapsulation ofpseudomonas-pictorum , a microorganism that removes cholesterol (Fig. 8.4) (Garofalo and Chang, 1991). Articial cells containingerwinia herbicola bacterium can Cells Fig. 8.4. Articial cells containing NADH oxidizing bacterium to repeatedly recycle NAD to NADH; articial cells containing Pseudomonas pictorum to remove cholesterol; containing to convert for Cell Encapsulation 215 and phenol to tyrosine in vitro (Fig. 8.4) (Lyold-George and Chang, 1995). Articial cells containing microorganisms to remove urea have also been studied. For example, fermentation induction of Escherichia coliwith Klebsiella aerogenes gene increases its capacity for urea removal. This can then be placed inside articial cells to removeurea (Fig. 8.5) (Prakash and Chang, 1996a). However, microorganismscannot be injected. An earlier study here on enzyme therapy usingarticial cells showed that articial cells can be given orally (Chang,1972a, 1974f, 1997l, 2005). We therefore administer these orally touremic rats. Our study showed that oral administration of polymericarticial cells containing Escherichia coli with Klebsiella aerogenes gene can lower the elevated systemic urea level in uremic rats (Prakashand Chang, 1996a). Articial cells containing another genetically Fig. 8.5. Articial cells containing a genetically engineered CH5 E. coli , that after fermentation induction, can remove systemic urea. Articial cellscontaining fermentation induced Lactobacillus delbrueckii that can remove urea when tested in vitro . This is not a genetically engineered cells and is used in yougart, being much safer than CH5 E. coli .April 2, 2007 15:42 SPI-B446 Articial Nanotechnology, Blood Cells engineered microorganism, bactobacillus plantarum 80 (pCBH1), have been studied in vitro for bile acid deconjugation (Jones et al. , 2004). However, it is important to ensure that any genetically engineerednonpathogenic microorganisms would have no adverse effects afteroral administration. Until then, regulatory agencies seem to requirethat there should be absolutely no leakage of genetically engineeredmicroorganisms from orally administered polymeric microcapsules, even though they are classied as nonpathogenic. In order to avoid the use of genetically engineered cells, we used metabolic inductionto increase the urea removal activities of Lactobacillus delbrueckii , and also to encapsulate this in articial cells to remove urea (Fig. 8.5)(Chow et al., 2003). Lactobacillus delbrueckii has been used widely in regulatory agency approved food products like yougart for many years. 8.7. Concluding Remarks More complicated applications of articial cells, such as cellencapsulation, have considerable therapeutic potential. As discussedin a recent consensus publication (Orive et al. , 2003), there has been signicant progress toward the successful transplantation ofarticial cell encapsulated cells in experimental animal models,which has resulted in promising potential therapies for a number ofconditions. However, there are major challenges to be resolved beforemeaningful, large-scale clinical trials can be carried out. The keyrequirements include reliable and safe sources of cells, biocompatibleand stable membranes with suitable molecular cut-off to preventimmune rejection, reproducibility of the product and long-termsurvival of the graft. In addition, if xenografts or genetically engineeredcells are used, there are also ethical, political and regulatory questionsthat need to be resolved. To promote development towards routineclinical applications, it is important to change our attitudes towardspolymeric articial cells. There has been a mistaken impression thatall polymeric articial cells involve very simple technologies that canbe easily developed for clinical use. We now know that this is not thecase, and we have to approach their use in a highly interdisciplinarymanner, integrating basic and applied research and developmentApril 2, 2007 SPI-B446 Articial Cells for Cell Encapsulation 217 involving polymer chemistry, cell physiology, molecular biology, biotechnology and other elds. This interdisciplinary approach willaccelerate the clinical realization of the many exciting potentialapplications, ushering us into a new and exciting era in whichdevelopment of polymeric articial cells can tap into the advancesin biotechnology and molecular biology. 8.8. Method I: Standard Alginate-Polylysine-Alginate Method Materials Sodium alginate is usually prepared as a 2.0% solution in 0.90 gm % sodium Division of Merck and Co. (Clark, NJ). Prior to its use, it is eitherlter sterilized or heat sterilized for 5 min. The reagents poly-l-lysine, MW 15,000-30,000; type IV from SigmaChemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethane sulphonic acid) buffer is purchased from Boehringer Mannheim(Montreal, and penicillin (Gibco Laboratories;Burlington, On), were used for hepatocyte. All the solutions are kept in an ice-cold bath before use as well as during the process of bioencapsulation. The pH of the solutionsis kept at 7.40 by buffering with N-2-hydroxylethyl piperazine-N-2enthanesulfonic acid Except for sodium alginate, the solutionsare ltering through a sterile 0.2 \u00b5m Millipore lter. Droplet generators We have used two differently sized droplet generators prepared by ourselves in the laboratory as well as a more elaborate commerciallyavailable one.April 2, 2007 Regenerative... 218 Articial Cells The rst laboratory prepared droplet generator consists of two co- axially arranged jets: the central jet consisted of a 26 G stainless steelneedle (Perfektum; Popper and Sons, Inc., New Hyde Park, NY), anda 16 G surrounding air jet, through which the sample and air wasrespectively passed. To prevent the extruding sample from occludingthe outlet of the surrounding air jet, the tip of the sample jet wasconstructed such that the tip projected 0.5 mm beyond the end ofthe air jet. The second laboratory prepared droplet generator was a larger and a slightly modied variation of the rst droplet generator describedabove. This generator consists of a 13 G sample jet, and a 8 Gsurrounding air jet. The ends of the jets are cut flush to each other. A 1.7 \u00d71.1 mm PTFE capillary tube (Pharmacia P-L Biochemicals; Montreal, PQ) is inserted into the sample jet until it protrudedapproximately 15 mm from the outlet of the sample jet. The end ofthe capillary tubing is tapered to facilitate shearing resulting from theflow of passing air from the air jet.The capillary tubing is approximately3.2 m in length, and has the capacity to be lled with microspheressuspended in 2.5 ml of sodium alginate. Commercial generator: For the preparation of larger samples, we used one of the commercial generators. Procedure1. Hepatocytes, hepatocytes and bone marrow cells, or bacterial cells are suspended in an autoclaved sodium alginate in ice-cold 0.90%sodium chloride solution. 2. The viscous alginate suspension is pressed through a 23 G stainless steel needle using a syringe pump (Compact infusion pump model-975Harvard App. Co. Inc., MA). Sterile compressed air, through a 16 Gcoaxial stainless steel needle, is used to shear the droplets coming outof the tip of the 23 G needle. 3. The droplets are allowed to gel for 15 min in a gently stirred heat sterilized and ice-cold solution of calcium chloride (1.4%, pH 7.2).Upon contact with Cells for Cell Encapsulation 219 4.

The beads are then washed with HEPES (pH 7.2) and coated with an alginate solution (0.1%) for 4 min. 6. The alginate-poly-L-lysine-alginate capsules so formed are then washed in a 3.00% citrate bath (3.00% in 1:1 HEPES-buffer saline,pH 7.2) to liquefy the gel in the microcapsules. 7. The APA microcapsules formed, which contain entrapped hepatocytes or bacterial cells. coli, are stored at 4 C to be used for experiments. The conditions are kept sterile during the process ofmicroencapsulation. 8.9. Method II: 2-Step Method The standard method described above is not optimal for encap- sulating high concentrations of cells or microorganisms. As shownschematically in Fig. 8.3, cells or microorganisms may be trapped inthe membrane matrix. This can weaken the membrane. If cells areexposed to the surface, the result may be loss of immunoisolation andrejection.Therefore, the two-step method has been developed with theaim to prevent this problem (Fig. 8.3) (Wong and Chang, 1991b). 1. First, the hepatocytes or hepatocytes and bone marrow stem cells or other cells suspended in sodium alginate are entrapped withinsolid calcium alginate microspheres. and Co.; Rutherford, NJ) the the sample with a syringe infusion pump(Harvard Apparatus; Mill, MA) through the sample jet of the rst dropletgenerator. The droplets formed at the end of the sample jet are allowedto fall drop-wise into a PYREX dish (125.65 mm) containing 300 ml100 mM CaCl 2(100 mM CaCl 2, 10 mM HEPES, 20 mM D-fructose, pH 7.4). Every 5 min the cells in the syringe are resuspended by gentleinversion of the syringe to minimize the effect cells inApril 2, 220 Articial Cells the alginate solution. The air flow and infusion rate through the droplet generator are 2.0-3.0 l/min. and 0.28-0.39 ml/min, respectively; theclearance height between the end of the sample jet and the surfaceof the calcium solution is set at approximately 20 cm. A strainer cupis tted inside the dish to collect the droplets, and to facilitate theremoval of the formed microspheres. 2.The microspheres are allowed to cure for approximately 15 min, after which they are removed and temporarily stored in Hank's BalancedSalt Solution (Gibco Laboratories; Burlington, Ont) supplemented with10%, 100 mM CaCl 2. 3. In the second step, 1.0 ml of formed microspheres is collected and washed three times with buffered saline (0.85% NaCl, 10 mM HEPES,20 mM D-fructose, pH 7.4). 4. The nal saline washing is aspirated and 1 ml of 1.2-1.6% sodium alginate is added to the 1.0 ml of washed microspheres. The sodiumalginate is prepared by diluting the 4% stock solution with bufferedsaline. Wit ha5m l syringe, the length of the PTFE capillary tubing is lled with the sodium alginate and suspension of microspheres. The tapered end of the capillary tubing is inserted through the top of the sample jet of the second droplet generator until the tip of thetubing extends approximately 15 mm beyond the end of the sample jet. The air flow and extrusion rate through the modied droplet generator are 7.0-9.0 l/min. and 0.28-0.39 ml/min, respectively. The tip of thecapillary tubing is set at approximately 20 cm above the surface of thecalcium solution. With the 5 ml syringe still attached to the other endof the tubing, the microsphere suspension in the tubing is extrudedusing the Harvard infusion pump. Similarly, the drops formed at theend of the sample jet are allowed to fall dropwise into a PYREX dishcontaining a strainer cup and lled with 300 ml of 100 mM CaCl 2. 5.

After 10 min, the spheres are collected and immersed in 200 ml 50 mM sodium citrate (50 mM sodium citrate, 0.47% NaCl, 20 mMD-fructose, pH 7.4) to solubilize the intracapsular calcium alginate. This may require up to 30 min with frequent changes of the sodium citrate solution. 8.10. Method III: Preparation of Cells for Encapsulation Preparation of rat hepatocytes 1.

For microorganisms to act oncholesterol bound to lipoprotein, the microorganisms have to microcapsules (47). Microorganism Pseudomonas pictorum (ATCC #23328) was used because of its ability to degrade cholesterol. It is rst cultured in nutrient broth (DIFCO)at 25 C, followed by harvesting and resuspension in a cholesterol medium for 15 days at 25C. The suspension can then be used as an inoculum for biomass production. The culture is grown in bovinecalf serum (Sigma) at 37 C for 36 h, and then harvested.

Introduction Articial cells and regenerative medicine Chapter 8 describes the potential of articial cells containing islets, cells, genetically engineered cells, microorganisms and stem cells fortreatment of a number of clinical conditions. Many of these clinicalconditions, like diabetes and neurological diseases, require long termtreatment. Chapter 8 also discusses the further development of cellencapsulation technologies needed for long term use. To cater formore immediate use, one area of research in this laboratory focuseson the use of articial cells in regenerative medicine. We have beenstudying the use of articial cells containing hepatocytes and/or bonemarrow stem cells for Fulminant hepatic failure orextensive liver resection for metastatic cancer or severe injury canresult in severe decrease in liver function not compatible with life. Onthe other hand, the liver is an organ that can regenerate itself, giventhe required time and condition. Thus, our aim is to study whetherarticial cells containing hepatocytes and/or bone marrow stem cellscan maintain the experimental animal alive, long enough to allow theliver to regenerate sufciently for the animal to recover (Fig. 9.1). 225April 2, 2007 15:30 SPI-B446 Articial Regenerative... ch09 FA 226 Articial Cells Fig. 9.1. Upper : Liver failure severe enough to be not compatible with life. This can be caused by acute hepatitis, massive traumatic injury or extensive cancer resection. Liver has the ability to regenerate itself to its original sizeif the patients can survive for a sufcient length of time under suitableconditions. Lower : We studied the use articial cells with 3 different contents for liver regeneration: (1) hepatocytes; (2) hepatocytes plus bone marrow stemcells; or (3) bone marrow stem cells alone.April 2, 2007 SPI-B446 Hepatocytes and/or Stem Cells in Regenerative Medicine 227 Design of study We use articial cells with three different contents (Fig. 9.1): 1) hepatocytes; 2) hepatocytes plus bone marrow stem cells; and 3) bonemarrow stem cells alone. We rst carried out a preliminary feasibility study on the use of articial cells containing hepatocytes in the galactosamine induced fulminant hepatic failure rat model. We then used the Gunn rats,a congenital rat model of hyperbilirubinemia, for more quantitativemeasurement. These studies show the feasibility of using articialcells to support liver function. Next, we carried out a study todetermine whether articial cells can prevent immunorejection, forexample, in articial cells containing rat hepatocytes injected intomice. We also developed an improved method for the encapsulationof hepatocytes in articial cells. Using this improved method ofpreparing articial cells containing both hepatocytes and bonemarrow stem cells, we showed that the duration of functions afterimplantation was improved. Furthermore, we studied the use of articial cells containing only bone marrow stem cells. The reason for this is that, although theuse articial cells can help prevent immunorejection without theneed for immunosuppressant, it is difcult to obtain hepatocytesfrom humans. If we use hepatocytes from animals, we can similarlyprevent immunorejection. However, since smaller protein moleculeslike albumin from the hepatocytes can diffuse out of the articialcells, there is the potential of immunological problems. On theother hand, obtaining bone marrow from humans for use in otherpatients is a routine hematological procedure. Thus, if we canuse articial cells containing only bone marrow stem cells, thenit would solve many of the potential problems. As describedin this chapter, we show that articial cells containing bonemarrow stem cells results in the regeneration of the liver andrecovery of the rats which had 90% of their livers surgicallyresected.April 2, 2007 Cells Containing Hepatocytes Galactosamine-induced fulminant hepatic failure in rats This is a preliminary feasibility study (Wong and Chang, 1986). Hepatocytes from 125-135 g Wistar rats were isolated and enclosedin articial cells as under\"Methods\" in Appendix II. Intraperitoneal injection of galactosamine(140 mg/100 g body weight) resulted in acute liver failure in the Wistar rats of 275-285 g. Forty-eight hours after the galactosamine injection, the rats in grade II coma were separated into pairs. Onerat in each pair was randomly selected as control and the other fortreatment. A total of 14 rats were used. In the control group, 4 mlof alginate articial cells containing no hepatocytes was injectedintraperitoneally. In treated group, 4 ml of alginate articial cellscontaining hepatocytes were similarly injected. 120 \u00b120 S.D. hepatocytes. The total number of articial cells was about 62,000 in the 4 ml of articial cellsinjected. Thus, each injection consists of articial cells containing atotal of about 7.4 \u00d710 6hepatocytes. These articial cells are flexible and can be easily injected using syringes. The animals were given foodand 5% glucose oral ad libitum . Survival and other parameters were monitored. Galactosamine-induced fulminant hepatic failure rats in the control group died 66.1 \u00b1S.D. 18.6 hours after galactosamine injection. The survival time in the group that received articial cells containinghepatocytes was 117.3 \u00b1D.S. 52.7 h. Paired analysis showed that this is signicantly ( P<0.025) higher than that of the control group. The total number of hepatocytes injected was only a small fraction of thetotal hepatocytes of the rat liver. This preliminary data encouragesus to pursue further studies using articial cells containing higherconcentrations of hepatocytes to study the effect on survival rates.However, we need to obtain more basic information before pursuingthese studies on survival rates. The galactosamine model is not alwaysreproducible.Thus, we opted to rst use a more stable Gunn rat animalmodel where we can carry out more quantitative measurements (BruniApril 2, 2007 15:30 SPI-B446 Hepatocytes and/or Stem Cells in Regenerative Medicine 229 and Chang, 1989). This would allow us to carry out more meaningful analysis on how to improve the articial cells system. Gunn rats with severe elevation of bilirubin, hyperbilirubinemia The homozygous phenotype of Gunn rats (Gunn, 1938), like their human counterpart in Crigler-Najjar syndrome, lacks the liver enzyme,UDP-glucuronyltransferase.This results in severe elevation of bilirubin,termed hyperbilirubinemia, appearing shortly after birth. In humans,death of the infant usually occur in the rst year of life. We usedthe Gunn rat model to carry out the following study (Bruni andChang, 1989). Articial cells containing hepatocytes were prepared(as described in the Methods section of Chapter 8). For this study,2.2 ml of a 50% suspension of articial cells were injected intra-peritoneally into the rats. The total number of viable hepatocytesimplanted in each rat was 15 \u00d710 6. Figure 9.2 shows the results of the rst study on 3.5-month-old female Gunn rats (Bruni and Chang, 1989). During the 16-day control Fig. 9.2. One intraperitoneal injection of articial cells containing a total of 15\u00d7106hepatocytes into Gunn rats. Effects on the lowering of systemic bilirubin (Bruni and Chang, 1989).April 2, Articial Cells period, serum bilirubin increased steadily at a rate of 0.32 \u00b10.07 mg/dl per day. Twenty days after the intraperitoneal injection of articialcells containing hepatocytes from Wistar rats, bilirubin 14 \u00b11 mg/dl \u00b11 mg/dl. Ninety days later, the serum bilirubin was still lower than the control period. This preliminary study was followed by a second study using both control and treated groups. The effect of articial cells containing hepatocytes (total hepatocytes in the articial cells being 15 \u00d710 6) was compared to two control groups (Burni and Chang, 1989): 1) Gunn rats received control articialcells containing no hepatocytes; and 2) Gunn rats receiving freehepatocytes (total of 15 \u00d710 6). Figure 9.3 shows that the serum bilirubin levels in the Gunn rats which received control articialcells containing no hepatocytes are signicantly higher than thosein the Gunn rats that received articial cells containing hepatocytes.Figure 9.3 shows that both free hepatocytes and articial cellscontaining the same number of viable hepatocytes have the same effect Fig. 9.3.

This shows that the method of preparing articial cells does not affect the ability of hepatocytesto conjugate bilirubin. The result also shows that free hepatocytesfrom the closely related Sprague-Dawley rats are not rejected by theGunn rats. Summary The results up to now show that hepatocytes in articial cells when injected, can carry out their functions. This is shown by the increasein survival time in a galactosamine fulminant hepatic failure ratmodel and the lowering of bilirubin in a hyperbilirubinemic Gunn rat.However, before pursuing further how this can help in the regenerationof the liver, it would be important rst, to study whether articial cellscan protect hepatocytes from immunorejection. 9.3. Immunoisolation Can articial cells protect hepatocytes from immunorejection? In order to answer this question, we follow the viability of rat hepatocytes implanted into mice either in the free form or inside thearticial cells (Wong and Chang, 1988). However, with implantedarticial cells, the viability of hepatocytes depends on more than onefactor. In addition to immunorejection, there is also brous coating andaggregation of articial cells related to biocompatibility. The result isdecreased viability due to lack of oxygen and nutrients. We opted rstto study only the factor related to immunorejection. This is done byfollowing only those articial cells that are not aggregated inside thebrous mass. Hepatocytes were obtained from the livers of male Wistar rats using the procedure as described in Appendix II. The viability ofthe hepatocytes prepared in this way was 86.0% as measured bytrypan blue exclusion . The hepatocytes were encapsulated inalginate-polylysine-alginate articial cells using the method describedin Appendix II. The viability of the hepatocytes using 2, 2007 Articial Cells was 63.4%. The recipients were 20-22 g male CD-1 Swiss mice. A total of 5 \u00d7106hepatocytes in either the free form or inside articial cells were implanted into each mouse intraperitoneally. Atpredetermined intervals, the mice were sacriced and the peritonealcavity was washed twice with 2.0 ml of iced Hanks balanced saltsolution. The viability of the hepatocytes was determined by trypanblue stain exclusion. As mentioned above, only the free articial cellswere analyzed in this study. The microcapsules were stained for 5 minand then punctured with sharp forceps to release the hepatocyte frominside the articial cells. The trypan blue stained and unstained cellswere counted under a light microscope and the total number of cellswas measured using a hemocytometer. Figure 9.4 shows the results obtained (Wong and Chang, 1988). The viability of free rat hepatocytes injected into mice decreased rapidly. Fig. 9.4. Intraperitoneal injection into each mouse of (1) 15 \u00d7106rat hepatocytes or (2) articial cells containing a total of 5 \u00d7106rat hepatocytes. Trypan blue dye exclusion is the method for analyzing the viability of free hepatocytes and hepatocytes in the articial cells that are free in the peritonealcavity. (Wong and Chang, 1988).April 2, 2007 and/or Stem Cells in Regenerative Medicine 233 No viable free hepatocytes were recovered by the 14th day. On the other hand, the viability of the hepatocytes inside the free articial cellssteadily increased, and by 29 days after implantation, the viability hasincreased from the original 63.4% to more than 90%. The result of thepresent study seems to show that rat hepatocytes in the free form arerejected rapidly after being injected intraperitoneally into mice. Forthe articial cells that were not aggregated, the rat hepatocytes insidewere protected from rejection after the cells were injected into mice.However, the increase in viability of hepatocytes inside the articialcells was an unexpected observation. We have therefore carried out aseparate study to nd out the reason. Why do rat hepatocytes inside articial cells recover their viability after implantation into mice? Factors which can stimulate liver regeneration have been isolated from the liver extract and serum of newborn rats or partially hepatectomizedrats. One of these factors has a molecular weight of <10,000 and the other one, a molecular weight of >100,000 (Michalopoulos et al. 1984). Alginate-polylysine-alginate membrane of articial cells is only permeable to molecules of up to 64,000 mol wt (Ito andChang, 1992). Our study (Kashani and Chang, 1988) shows that thehigher molecular weight hepatic growth factor of >100,000 m.w. is continuously secreted by the hepatocytes inside the articial cells.Since this type of articial cells is not permeable to molecules largerthan 64,000, we found that the >100,000 m.w. hepatic growth factor continues to accumulate inside the articial cells. Trypan blue stainexclusion only shows the increase in permeability and damage of thehepatocytes and not necessarily death of the hepatocytes. Thus, it islikely that the increasing concentration of this hepatic growth factorinside the articial cells may have played a role in the regeneration ofthe damaged hepatocytes inside the articial cells. Aggregation of articial cells after implantation It has been generally accepted that aggregation of articial cells afterimplantation is due to the problem biocompatibility. mentionedApril 2, 2007 Articial Cells earlier, the aggregation of the articial cells was due to brous coating. We now look at another possible reason. We examined the articial cells containing rat hepatocytes that have form brous aggregatesafter implantation into mice (Wong and Chang, 1991a). In many suchcases, one can nd the occasional hepatocytes extruding out of themembrane of the articial cells after implantation (Fig. 9.5). The mostsevere tissue reaction seems to occur especially at these sites. We then carried out another study on newly prepared alginate- polylysine-alginate articial cells containing hepatocytes that have notbeen implanted. Using serial sections, we observed that in a signicantnumber of the articial cells, hepatocytes were extruding out of themembrane or entrapped in the membrane of the articial cells (Fig. 9.5)(Wong and Chang, 1991a). We hypothesize that this may be one of thecauses of the aggregation of the articial cells containing hepatocytes.Each articial cell contains more than 100 hepatocytes. Even whenone hepatocyte out of these is exposed to the surface, the body willgenerate an immune response, resulting in the rejection of the wholearticial cell. In those cases where the hepatocytes are entrappedin the membrane but not exposed to the outside, weakening of themembrane will result. With time, erosion can result in the hepatocytesbeing exposed to the outside, followed by immunorejection. My analysis of the standard method of preparation shows that with more than 100 hepatocytes in one articial cell, the exposure ofone or two hepatocytes to the surface is likely a random process(Fig. 9.5). I therefore devised a two step method to overcome thisproblem.The procedure and principle have been described in detail inChapter 8 and Appendix II (Wong and Chang, 1991b). Thus, extrusionof hepatocytes to the outside and entrapment in the membrane areprevented (Fig. 9.5). Articial cells prepared by standard method: cell viability after implantation Implanted articial cells were recovered by laparotomy and analyzed (Liu and Chang, 2002). For the articial cells prepared using thestandard method, from week 2, most of the microcapsules were seenattached to the greater momentum, portal tract, pancreas and surfaceApril 2, 2007 15:30 SPI-B446 Hepatocytes and/or Stem Cells in Regenerative Medicine 235 Fig. 9.5. Upper : Serial section of articial cells containing hepatocytes freshly prepared using the standard method. A hepatocyte is seen to extrudeto the outside and another one is entrapped in the membrane of the articialcell. Middle : After implantation in mice, brous tissue can be seen at site where rat hepatocyte extrudes to the outside. Membrane defects are present14 days after implantation. Lower : Articial cell containing rat hepatocytes prepared using the new 2-step method show no hepatocytes extrusion or entrapment. No membrane defect was observed 14 days after intraperitoneal injection into mice. (Wong and Chang 1991a, 1991b; Liu and Chang, 2002).April 2, 236 Articial Cells of the liver and the spleen. At week 3, very few intact free articial cells could be recovered; at week 4, the aggregated microcapsuleswere enclosed by more connective tissue, and some newly formedblood vessels were observed among the aggregates of microcapsules.Under the microscope, macrophages and lymphocytes were foundinltrating the capsular membrane (Fig. 9.5). No further morphologicaland viability studies were carried out in these groups after week 4, aslittle or no intact microcapsules could be recovered. Articial cells prepared by two-step method: cell viability after implantation In contrast to the above results, when articial cells were prepared using the new two-step method, the following results were obtained(Liu and Chang, 2002). At week 4, more than 90% of transplantedintact microcapsules could be recovered. At 8 weeks, 12 weeks and16 weeks, the recovery rate was 60%, 50%, 20%, respectively. Fromweek 4 on, some articial cells were found attached to the greateromentum. Microscopic studies showed little or no inflammatorycells inltration in the recovered microcapsules membrane (Fig.9.5). Viability study shows that after the two-step encapsulation, thehepatocytes viability inside the articial cells was theworst example of articial cells containing hepatocytes preparedusing the standard method, one could see membrane holes and cellentrapments (Fig. 9.5). Articial cells prepared using the two stepmethods do not show such imperfections after implantation (Fig. 9.5). The result serve to show that biocompatibility is not the only factor that causes the aggregation and brous enclosure of articial cellsafter implantation. 9.4. Articial Cells Containing Hepatocytes or Hepatocytes Plus Stem Cells Introduction The next step is to try to further increase the duration of function and viability of the hepatocytes inside articial cells. For this purpose,April 2, Hepatocytes and/or Stem Cells in Regenerative Medicine 237 we compare articial cells containing hepatocytes to articial cells containing hepatocytes and stem cells prepared by the two-stepmethod. Viability of free cells in culture We rst studied plated culture hepatocytes and compare this to plated co-culture of hepatocytes and bone marrow stroma cells (Liuand Chang, 2000). Free hepatocytes are detache d 4 h after plating, and reached the optimal growth stage at day 7. At day 14, mosthepatocytes became detached and cell death occurred. In the co-culture of hepatocytes and bone marrow stem cells, the hepatocyteswere maintained for a longer period of time (14-21 days) than those ofthe hepatocyte culture. At day 14, most of the hepatocytes remainedattached, and showed normal growth. This result leads us to the nextstep of coencapsulating hepatocytes and bone marrow stem cells inarticial cells. In vitro viability of encapsulated cells We compare the in vitro viability of hepatocytes encapsulated alone in articial cells with that of hepatocytes co-encapsulated with abone marrow stem cells (Liu and Chang, 2000). They are prepared asdescribed under Methods in Chapter 8. The most striking microscopicobservation is that when only hepatocytes are encapsulated, mostof the cells remain single after encapsulation and during the cultureperiod (Fig. 9.6). When co-encapsulated with bone marrow stem cells,most of the hepatocytes are attached to one another after encapsulationand during the culture period (Fig. 9.6). Mechanical rupturing ofthe articial cells releases the encapsulated cells for viability studiesusing trypan blue exclusion. After isolation from the intact liver, theviability of the hepatocytes was 85%-90%, and after isolation fromthe femur, the bone marrow stem cells (nucleated cells) was 95%-100%. Immediately after encapsulation, the hepatocytes viability was76%-83%. Starting from day 14 in the culture medium, the viabilityof hepatocytes in co-encapsulation was Cells TIME (DAYS)AC HEPATOCYTES AC HEPATOCYTES + STEM CELLS 0 1 42 84 25 67 08 49 8 1 1 290 0IMPLANTED INTO RATS% VIABILITY % VIABILITY90 0 0 7 14 21 28 TIME (DAYS)AC HEPATOCYTES AC HEPATOCYTES + STEM CELLSIN CULTURE AFTER 28 DAYS IN CULTURE Most hepatocytes become detached with lowerviability Most hepatocytes remained attached and viableHepatocytes in AC Hepatocytes + BMSC in AC Fig. 9.6.

After28 days in culture; Upper : appearance of hepatocytes when encapsulated alone ( left) and in combination with stem cells ( right); and Middle : viability in culture; Lower : viability after implantation into rats. (Liu and Chang, 2002).April 2, 2007 15:30 SPI-B446 Regenerative Medicine 239 hepatocytes encapsulated alone ( P<0.01) (Fig. 9.6). By the 28th days, the viability of the hepatocytes co-encapsulated with bone marrowcells was maintained at a high level (Fig. 9.6). On the other hand, theviability of the hepatocytes encapsulated alone has fallen to very lowlevels (Fig. 9.6). After implantation, the viability or hepatocytes in 1) articial cells contain hepatocytes alone; and 2) articial cells containing both hepatocytes and bone marrow stem cells, are as follows. From week 1 to week 6 post-transplantation, there was no signicant difference inhepatocytes viability between the 2 groups (Fig. 9.6). However, fromweek 7 to week 16 post-transplantation, the viability of the hepatocytesco-encapsulated with bone marrow stem cells, was signicantly higherthan that of the group with only hepatocytes (Fig. 9.6). The average cellnumber in each articial cell containing both hepatocytes and bonemarrow stem cells remained the same. Discussion of above results Articial cells containing both hepatocytes and bone marrow stem cells make possible a greater hepatocyte viability in culture and afterimplantation. The exact mechanism by which the bone marrow cellsfacilitate the maintenance of the hepatocytes is unknown. When co-encapsulated with bone marrow stem cells, the hepatocytes were foundto attach to one another, whereas when encapsulated alone, mosthepatocytes remained unattached (Liu and Chang, 2002). The aboveresults seem to show that both cell-cell interactions and secretions fromthe bone marrow stem cells may contribute to this outcome. In addition,other groups have shown that attachment among cells is very importantfor maintaining hepatocytes viability and liver specic function insidethe articial cells (Theise et al. , 2000). Our results show that the co- encapsulation of hepatocytes and bone marrow stem cells improveshepatocytes viability when implanted into normal rats. In addition thenew two-step encapsulation method provides for improved viability ofimplanted hepatocytes.This hepatocyte viability was increased to morethan 3 months and therefore approached a level such that they couldpossibly be used in our study of liver regeneration. First, a quantitativestudy was carried out to see if this increase in viability corresponds toactual increase in function.April 2, 2007 Regenerative... ch09 FA 240 Articial Cells Study using Gunn rat model We compare the effect of implantation of articial cells prepared using the two-step method and containing 1) no hepatocytes; 2) hepatocytes;and 3) both hepatocytes and bone marrow stem cells (Fig. 9.7) (Liuand Chang, 2003). In the Gunn rats, the blood total bilirubin level was4.4\u00b10.86 mg/dl before injection of the articial cells. In the control groups of empty articial cells, the bilirubin levels increased steadilythroughout the 8 weeks and by week 8, the bilirubin level had reached9mg/dl, about doubled the initial values. For articial cells containingonly hepatocytes, the plasma bilirubin levels decreased signicantly,reaching the lowest level (2.7 mg/dl) at week 2 after transplantation. After this, the bilirubin level increased progressively reaching the same levels as the control groups at week 7 post transplantation. For articialcells containing both hepatocytes and bone marrow stem cells, thebilirubin levels also decreased to the lowest level at week 2 after 024681012 0 1 02 03 + STEM CELLS Fig. 9.7.

However, the important difference is that in this case, the level remained signicantly lower than that of the control groupup to 8 weeks after injection (Fig. 9.7) (Liu and Chang, 2003). 9.5. Articial Cells Containing Hepatocytes in Rats with 90% of Liver Surgically Removed Introduction The above studies show that co-encapsulation of hepatocytes and bone marrow stem cells inside articial cells allows us to attain 8 weeks ofboth hepatocyte viability and hepatocyte function. This means that weare ready to proceed to the next step of studying the use of this methodfor liver regeneration. Our original plan was to study the regenerationof liver in rats with 90% of liver surgically removed using the following:1) control with no hepatectomy; 2) control with hepatectomy; 3) freehepatocytes; 4) articial cells containing hepatocytes; 5) articial cellscontaining both hepatocytes and bone marrow stem cells; 6) free bonemarrow stem cells; 7) articial cells containing bone marrow stemcells. We started with (1), (2), (3) and (4) and obtained the followingresults. Articial cells prepared using 2-step method on survival of rats with 90% of liver surgically removed In the 90% hepatectomy group (PH) and the PH groups that received empty control microcapsules, most of the rats died in the rstthree days after hepatectomy. There was no death in the shamcontrol group of rats that did not undergo liver resection. In thetwo groups receiving articial cells containing hepatocytes or freehepatocytes, the survival rate was not signicantly different fromthat of the sham control group (Fig. 9.8) (Liu and Chang, 2006).Free hepatocytes from Wistar rats were not immunorejected by theGunn rats. Thus, both free hepatocytes and articial cells containinghepatocytes alone enabled the rat liver to regenerate resulting in theApril 2, 2007 15:30 SPI-B446 Articial Regenerative... ch09 FA 242 Articial Cells Fig. 9.8. Except for one group with no hepatectomy, the other groups are rats with 90% of their liver removed surgically. One intraperitoneal injectionof (1) free hepatocytes; or (2) hepatocytes in articial cells (AC) results in increased in survival rates that are not signicantly different from the normalrats. (Liu and Chang, 2005). recovery of the rats. However, three important points need to be considered. Factors to be considered (1) Rat liver can regenerate much faster than human liver. The resultsdiscussed earlier in this chapter show that articial cells prepared usingthe new two step method containing hepatocytes alone can remainviable after implantation for up to 14 days and they can also functioneffectively in maintaining a low bilirubin in the Gunn rats for up to14 days. In humans, liver regeneration takes much longer and 14 daysmay not be sufcient and most likely need up to 8 weeks. Thus, onewould likely need to consider the use of articial cells containing bothhepatocytes and bone marrow stem cells that have a much longerduration of function and viability after implantation, i.e. up to 8 weeks.April 2, 2007 15:30 SPI-B446 Hepatocytes and/or Stem Cells in Regenerative Medicine 243 (2) The present rat model with 90% of the liver removed surgically can be applied to clinical situations where liver resection is soextensive that it is not compatible with life. This is especially the casein extensive cancer metastasis to the liver or in extensive traumaticinjuries to the liver. However, in the case of fulminant hepatic failure, inaddition to inadequate liver function, there is also the other importantfactor of toxins released from the necrotic liver cells. These toxinscan inhibit the regeneration of the remaining liver tissue, in additionto being toxic to the body. The next chapter describes the use ofan adsorbent articial cell hemoperfusion device to remove thesetoxins. This results in the removal of the toxins and the recovery ofconsciousness in grade IV hepatic coma patients (Chang, 1972b).However, hemoperfusion only removes the toxins and does not enablethe production of hepatic growth factor to stimulate the regenerationof the liver or render to support the inadequate liver functions. Acombination of hemoperfusion at the beginning to remove the toxinsand use of articial cells containing hepatocytes and bone marrowstem cell should provide the needed functions. (3) Although articial cells containing hepatocytes can prevent immunorejection without the need for immunosuppressant, it isdifcult to obtain hepatocytes from humans. The use of hepatocytesfrom animals can also help prevent immunorejection by using articialcells. However, since smaller protein molecules like albumin secretedby the enclosed hepatocytes can diffuse out of the articial cells,there is the potential of immunological problems. On the other hand,obtaining bone marrow from humans for use in other patients is aroutine hematological procedure. Thus, if we can use articial cellscontaining only bone marrow stem cells, then we would solve manyof the potential problems. Thus, we carried out the next study on thispossibility. 9.6. Articial Cells Containing Bone Marrow Stem Cells In this study, we injected articial cells containing bone marrowstem cells intraperitoneally into Regenerative... ch09 FA 244 Articial Cells Fig. 9.9. Survival rates of rats with 90% of liver surgically removed, hepatectomy compared to those without removal of liver tissues (nohepatectomy). One peritoneal injection of articial cells containing bone marrow stem cells resulted in the survival of the 90% hepatectomized rats.On the other hand, free bone marrow stem cells did not signicantly increasethe survival rates. (Liu and Chang, 2006). Chang, 2006). We then studied the survival rates of the rats and the transdifferentiation of bone marrow stem cells. Viability of isolated cells About 3 \u00d7108nucleated BMCs could be obtained from the two femurs of each rat. BMCs viability after bioencapsulation was 98%.Hepatocytes viability after encapsulation was 82%. Survival rates of rats with 90% of liver surgically removed Figure 9.10 shows the survival rates of the following groups: 90%hepatectomized rats receiving 1) no articial cells as control; 2) freebone marrow stem cells; and Hepatocytes and/or Stem Cells in Regenerative Medicine 245 LIVER WEIGHTS AFTER 2 WEEKS Liu & Chang; J Liver Transplant (2006)LIVER WEIGHT (GRAM)25 STEM CELLS H - HEPATOCYTES Fig. 9.10. This summarizes the liver weights of the rats that have survived 2 weeks after 90% of liver in each rat was surgically removed (hepatectomy).In the 3 groups where most of the rats died, those few that survived have amuch lower liver weight. In those groups where all the rats survived after2 weeks, the liver weights are not signicantly different from the shamcontrol group. This shows that in these groups, the 10% remaining livershave regenerated to the normal size. The rats in the sham control group didnot have any of their liver removed. (Liu and Chang, 2006.) marrow stem cells. The 4th group consisted of sham control rats that have not received hepatectomy. In the 90% hepatectomized controlgroup, and the groups that received free bone marrow stem cells, thesurvival rates were signicantly lower than the sham control groupwith most of the mortality occurring in the rst three days post-surgery. There was no signicant difference in the survival rates between the sham control group and the group receiving articial cells containingbone marrow stem cells. Thus it would appear that in rats, articialcells containing bone marrow stem cells are as effective as articialcells containing hepatocytes in improving the survival rates of 2, Regenerative... ch09 FA 246 Articial Cells Remnant liver weight For those rats that survived at week 2 post hepatectomy, the remnant livers were removed, and the weights were measured. In the 90%hepatectomized rats that received 1) articial cells containing bonemarrow stem cells; 2) free hepatocytes; or 3) articial cells containinghepatocytes, the liver wet weights were not signicantly different fromthose of the sham control group (Fig. 9.11) (Liu and Chang, 2006).On the other hand, most of the animals did not survive in the 90%hepatectomized rats that 1) received no injection; 2) received controlarticial cells containing no cells; and 3) received free bone marrowstem cells (Fig. 9.11). In those few that survived, the liver weights weremuch lower, but the small number did not allow for statistical analysis. Blood chemistry From blood chemistry (Liu and Chang, 2006), it was shown that exceptfor the sham surgery group, the albumin levels in all the other groupsdecreased from day 1 post-surgery. After this, in the group that receivedarticial cells containing hepatocytes, the albumin levels increasedand reached the normal level at day 2 post surgery. In the groupsthat received articial cells containing bone marrow stem cells, thealbumin only started to increase from day 3 post-surgery and reachedthe pre-surgery level in about one week. Blood levels of ALT and AST increased and reached peak levels at day 1 post-surgery for the control articial cell group, free bone marrow stem cell group and thecontrol group receiving no treatment. In the groups that received freehepatocytes or articial cells containing bone marrow stem cells orhepatocytes, the results were different. There were signicantly lowerincreases in the ALT, AST levels as compared to the hepatectomizedgroup that received no injection or injection of control articial cellscontaining no cells. Plasma hepatic growth factor (HGF) levels In the hepatectomized groups that received articial cells containinghepatocytes or articial cells containing bone marrow stem theApril 2, 2007 SPI-B446 and/or Stem Cells in Regenerative Medicine 247 Fig. 9.11.

PH =surgical removal of 90% of the liver. BMCs =bone marrow stem cells. H =hepatocytes. Encap = in articial cells. (Liu and Chang, 2006.) blood levels of HGF peaked at days 2 and 3 post surgery, and were signicantly higher than those in the other groups (Liu and Chang,2006). After this, the levels decreased and returned to pre-surgerylevel on day 14. In the free hepatocytes transplantation group, thepeaked level was signicantly lower at day 2 post surgery, decreasingto pre-surgery level at day 7. In the control hepatectomized groups thatreceived 1) no treatment 2) articial cells containing no cells group;or 3) free bone marrow stem cells, the blood HGF levels were muchlower (Fig. 9.11). Laparotomy and histology Two weeks after transplantation, laparotomy showed that in the group that received articial cells containing bone marrow stem cells, thearticial cells remained in the peritoneal cavity.They were found freelydistributed throughout the peritoneal cavity or to be behind the liveror under the spleen had adhered or attached to the large omentum.Histology examination of the bone marrow stem cells in the articialApril 2, 2007 15:30 SPI-B446 Articial CELLS growth factor (HGF) 2.

Lower : Possible mechanisms for articial cells containing bone marrow stem cells inliver regeneration. (Liu and Chang, 2006.)April 2, Hepatocytes and/or Stem Cells in Regenerative Medicine 249 cells showed that before transplantation most cells were polygonal, star like, some with tail shape cytoplasm (Fig. 9.12). When they wereretrieved two weeks after transplantation, much of cells morphologywas transformed into round or oval shape (Fig. 9.12) (Liu and Chang,2006). Immunocytochemistry Hepatocytes recovered from articial cells show cluster of stained with hepatocyte markers CK8 and CK18 and alsoshowing of albumin ALB (Fig. 9.12), but no cells wasfound to stain positive with AFP. Before implantation, the bonemarrow stem cells recovered from articial cells did not show positiveimmunochemistry stain. However, when bone marrow stem cellswere recovered from the articial cells retrieved at week 2 afterimplantation, it was found that scattered cells were positively stainedwith hepatocyte markers CK8 and CK18 and also albumin production(Fig. 9.12). There were also cells that stained positively with AFP(Fig. 9.12 ) (Liu and Chang, 2006). PAS glycogen stain PAS staining revealed that hepatocytes recovered from articial cellsretrieved 2 weeks post-transplantation were positive for PAS, indicatingthese hepatocytes remained capability of glycogen production. In thebone marrow stem cells recovered from articial cells retrieved twoweeks post-transplantation, there were also cells that stained positivefor PAS, indicating that the cells are capable of producing of glycogen(Fig. 9.12). Possible mechanisms responsible for recovery of 90% hepatectomized rat model What are the mechanisms responsible for the recovery of 90% hepatectomized rat model in our study? Most likely two combinedmechanisms are involved 1) The bone marrow stem cells in theApril 2, 2007 15:30 SPI-B446 Articial Cells articial cells release the hepatic growth factors HGFs that stimulate the regeneration of the remaining 10% liver in the rats that had 90%of the livers surgically removed; and 2) transdifferentiation of the bonemarrow stem cells in the articial cells into hepatocytes (Fig. 9.12). (1) Transdifferentiation into hepatocytes. Our immunochemistry stain studies show that some of the bone marrow stem cells recovered from the articial cells transdifferentiated into hepatocyte-like cellsthat expressed ALB, CK8, CK and produced albumin and glycogen. into hepatocyte-like cells is not immediate (Lagasse et al., 2000). Thus, the number of transdifferentiated cells was limited at the beginning and thisalone could not have provided all the liver support observed inour study. (2) Another possible mechanism involves the hepatic growth factors (HGFs) an important factor in liver regeneration (Rokstad et al. , 2002) as well as in stimulation of the transdifferentiation of BMCsinto hepatocytes (Spangrude et al. , 1988). The level of HGF increases in acute or chronic liver failure (Uchida and Weissman,1992). As discussed earlier, there are two subgroups of HGF, onebeing of higher molecular weight of >100,000 and the other of smaller molecular weight of <10,000 (Michalopoulos et al., 1984). Alginate-polylysine-alginate membrane articial cells allow the passage of molecules of 64,000 or less and retain those >64,000 (Ito and Chang, 1992). Our earlier study showed that HGF of>100,000 m.w. secreted by hepatocytes were retained and they accumulated in the articial cells, thus helping to increase theregeneration of hepatocytes in the articial cells (Kashani andChang, 1988). The smaller molecule weight HGF of <10,000 can diffuse out of the articial cells to stimulate the regeneration ofthe remaining 10% liver mass in the 90% hepatectomized rats.Indeed, Rokstad et al. (2002) showed that certain type of HGF was able to pass through the APA membrane and these most likely arethose in the <10,000 m.w. range. In this regard, our showedApril 2, SPI-B446 Hepatocytes and/or Stem Cells in Regenerative Medicine 251 that in the 90% hepatectomized rats that received articial cells containing bone marrow stem cells, the blood HGF levels weresignicantly higher than those in the other groups, including the90% hepatectomized group (Fig. 9.11). The HGF-like factors weremost likely released from the bone marrow stem cell inside thearticial cells. As a result, the HGF stimulated the remnant liverto regenerate faster in the rst days post transplantation beforethere was enough transdifferentiation of stem cells inside thearticial cells into hepatocytes (Fig. 9.12). Further support for thisexplanation is that articial cells containing bone marrow stemcells stayed in the intraperitoneal cavity throughout the 14 days ofthe study. Thus, the HGF secreted can be drained into the portalcirculation to reach the 10% remaining liver mass to stimulate itsregeneration. On the other hand, intraperitoneal injection of freebone marrow stem cells did not increase the survival rates. This ismost likely because the free bone marrow stem cells are rapidlyremoved from the peritoneal cavity through the lymphatic drainageand any HGF released does not drain into the portal circulation andstimulate the regeneration of the remnant liver. 9.7. Articial Cells Containing Stem Cells in Regeneration Medicine It would appear from the above study that implantation of articial cells containing bone marrow stem cells results in the regenerationof the 90% hepatectomized liver and the survival of the animal. Thisis as effective as the injection of free hepatocytes or articial cellscontaining hepatocytes. It is likely that hepatic growth factor HGFplays an important initial role followed by transdifferentiation intohepatocytes. These observations could stimulate further investigationof the potential for an alternative to hepatocytes transplantation for thetreatment of acute liver failure or extensive liver resection. The use ofarticial cells containing stem cells could also be investigated in otherareas of regenerative medicine.April 2, Regenerative... ch10 FA CHAPTER 10 Hemoperfusion in Poisoning, Kidney Failure, Liver Failure, and Immunology 10.1. Introduction Articial kidney machine Kolff (1944) invented the articial kidney, hemodialyzer, that has for many years supported the lives of thousands of kidney failure patientsand also saved many lives from fatal accidental or suicidal poisoning.Unfortunately, only a small fraction of the world's patients can benetfrom this treatment due to the high costs of the machine and treatment.In accidental or suicidal poisoning, in addition to the costs of themachine there are additional factors preventing its more commonuses. For example, in many centers, especially the smaller ones, ahemodialyzer is not readily available. Furthermore, there are problemsrelated to the length of treatment required, the possible fluctuation inextracorporeal blood volume and the specialized personnel required. Hemoperfusion based on articial cells While working on the biotechnological aspect of articial cells, I did some analysis and found that articial cells can be the basis of a verysimple and inexpensive detoxier that can more efciently carry outthe detoxifying function of the hemodialyzer (Chang, 1966). Being aphysician, my rst aim is to develop something for more immediateuse in patients. As a result, while continuing with basic researchon the biotechnology of articial cells, I spent a major part of my 252April 2, 2007 15:50 SPI-B446 Regenerative... ch10 Hemoperfusion in Poisoning, Kidney Failure, Liver Failure, and Immunology 253 earlier 10 years of research career in developing this idea for clinical use in patients. This resulted in articial cells containing adsorbentsforming a miniaturized detoxier that is much simpler, less costly will be described in detail later, but briefly it is based onthousands of 90 micron diameter adsorbent articial cells retainedinside a small container by screens at either end (Fig. 10.1). Bloodfrom patients containing toxins or drug perfuses through the screen tocome in contact with the articial cells. Toxins or drugs diffusing intothe articial cells are removed by the adsorbents inside the articialcells.This cleanses the blood that returns to the patient.The membraneof the articial cells prevents the adsorbent from being released intothe body and also prevents the adsorbent from damaging the bloodcells (Fig. 10.1). 10.2. Development and Clinical Trials When I presented this concept and the prototype at the annual meeting of the ASAIO (Chang, 1966), Professor Kolff was most supportive andencouraging. He wrote a letter to the Medical Research Council ofCanada giving his strong support. This letter played an important rolein my successful application for an MRC special project grant for meto develop and test the concept in my laboratory for clinical trials. Atthat time this was a very new idea and physicians were not ready touse it on their patients in clinical trials. Professor Kolff again offeredhis support by writing a letter stating that he would invite me to go tohis center to carry out clinical trials on the invention if no one else wasprepared to do so. With this strong support, McGill's human ethicscommittee having reviewed in details all the preclinical safety andefcacy animal studies (Chang, 1969a, 1972a, Chang & Malave, 1970,Chang et al., 1971a) approved the use of the invention in clinical trials at McGill's teaching hospitals. The arrangement was for me to preparethe hemoperfusion device in my laboratory which could then be usedat the hospitals for clinical trials. It was agreed that the procedureas described in the next section be followed.

Treatment of patients with severe accidental or suicidal poisoning The phase I safety study demonstrated the safe use of the hemoperfusion device in patients (Chang and Malave, 1970; Changet al. , 1971a, Chang, 1972a) and as a result clinical trials on efcacy followed. Clinical trials on its use in suicidal or accidental poisoningwere more straight forward. The efcacy could be shown after the oneor two treatments and the results could be assessed both quantitativelyand clinically. Thus, clinical trials were successfully carried out inthe rst three patients (Chang et al. , 1973a, 1973b). Altogether, 11 adult patients (Chang 1975g, 1976c, and one pediatric patientparticipated (Chang et al. , 1980a) all with conclusive clinical results. These will be discussed in more detail in a later section. The successful clinical trials led to the routine use of this approach around the worldfor the treatment of drug poisoning (Better et al. , 1979; Biberstein Piskin and Chang, 1982; 1983; 2002; Lopez-Lago et al., 2002; Peng et al., 2004; Chinese Symposium on Hemoperfusion, 2005). The method of preparing articial cells containing an adsorbent has been published in reproducible format for all to use (Chang, 1972a,1976g). As a result, a number of countries, for instance, Canada, China,USA, United Kingdom, Japan, Sweden, Italy, Spain and USSR were ableto produce their own variations of industrial hemoperfusion deviceswith the usual variations in efcacy and biocompatibility. While theinferior ones are no longer in use, those that are safe and effectiveare being used in routine clinical treatment of accidental and suicidalpoisoning. For some unknown reasons, in some areas of the world,April 2, 2007 15:50 SPI-B446 Articial Regenerative... ch10 FA 256 Articial Cells these devices are extremely expensive and as a result, their use is not widespread. In other areas of the world, especially where hemodialysismachines are not easily accessible, inexpensive but safe and efcientdevices are being produced and used extensively, saving thousands ofpatients with potentially fatal accidental or suicidal poisoning. Hemoperfusion for removal of unwanted or toxic substances from blood under other conditions Hemoperfusion has been an established routine clinical method for the treatment of patients with severe suicidal and accidental poisoning formany years. Its ability to remove unwanted or toxic substances from theblood also comes in useful in other clinical conditions. This includesits use in liver failure, kidney failure and use as an immunosorbent.In liver failure and kidney failure, hemoperfusion carries out only partof the functions of these organs, mainly in the removal of toxic orunwanted substances from the blood. Treatment of patients with terminal kidney failure Hemoperfusion in terminal kidney failure patients results in theimprovements of well-being and uremic and the larger \"middle\" (Chang, and Migchelsen, 1973; Chang and Lister, 1980; 1981). \"Middlemolecule\" is a term used by nephrologists to denote molecules in themolecular weight range of 300 to 15,000. However, hemoperfusiondoes not remove electrolytes, water or urea. Thus, it has been usedin series with hemodialyzers as hemodialyzers were, at that time noteffective in removing the larger \"middle\" molecules that were thoughtto be uremic toxins. Clinicians around the world who use the better commercially prepared hemoperfusion devices in series with hemodialyzers reportedclinical improvements in well-being of patients, nerve conductionvelocity, pruritis, pericarditis, peripheral neuropathy as well asreduction in treatment time (Chang et al. , 1975, 1982b; Martin et al. , Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... ch10 Kidney Failure, Liver Failure, and Immunology 257 1980; Stefoni et al. , 1980). Since then, the quality of hemodialysis membranes has improved and the present high flux membranes aresuperior to the standard dialysis membrane in removing the larger\"middle\" molecules. Even then, the clearance is still much lessthan compared to the better hemoperfusion devices. Hemoperfusiondevices are usually manufactured by manufacturers of hemodialysismachines and membranes. In those countries with strong hemodialysiscompanies, the hemoperfusion devices are extremely expensive. Onthe other hand, in those countries with no large dialysis industries,hemoperfusion devices are not expensive and therefore continued tobe used in renal failure patients. In all the countries, hemoperfusioncontinues to be commonly used for uremic patients with aluminium oriron overload. This is based on the earlier clinical demonstration of theuse of deferoxamine to bind these heavy metals and of hemoperfusionto remove the complex (Chang and Barre, 1983; Chang, 1986d; al. , 1984a, 1989a; Hakim et al. , 1985; Winchester 1996). In an attempt to eliminate the need for the bulky and expensive hemodialysis machine, hemoperfusion has been used in series witha small ultraltrator with oral adsorbents to control potassium andphosphates (Chang et al., 1975, 1977b, 1979a; Chang, 1976c).An urea removal system is being developed to complete the hemoperfusion-ultraltrator approach. Treatment of patients with hepatic coma The effectiveness of hemoperfusion devices in removing toxins from the circulating blood has also been shown in hepatic coma patients. Thus, the rst use of the device in a grade IV hepatic coma patient resulted in the recovery of consciousness in the patient within anhour (Chang, 1972b). As will be described later, this was followed byextensive clinical trials in hepatic coma patients around the world,with effective removal of hepatic toxins and resulting in recoveryof 1978; al., 1980; Articial Cells O'Grady et al. , 1988). However, liver is a complex organ with many other functions besides detoxication. Thus, a detoxier alone cannotfully support liver function. As mentioned in the previous chapter,hemoperfusion could play an important role in removing hepatictoxins to allow the use of articial cells containing hepatocytes andstem cells for liver regeneration. Protein-coated articial cells Albumin can the ultrathin collodion membrane of adsorbent articial cells, and was initially used to increase theblood compatibility of the adsorbent articial cells for hemoperfusion(Chang, 1969a). This albumin coating has also been applied tosynthetic immunosorbents, resulting in blood compatible syntheticblood group immunosorbents (Chang, 1980d). The albumin-coatedsynthetic adsorbent has been applied clinically for removing bloodgroup antibodies from plasma for bone marrow transplantation(Bensinger et al. , 1981). In addition, albumin-coated collodion activated charcoal (ACAC) was found to effectively remove antibodiesto albumin in animal studies (Terman et al. , 1977). This principle has become a basis of one line of research in which other types of antigensor antibodies are applied to the collodion coating of the activatedcharcoal to form immunosorbents. Other immonosorbents based onthe same principle have also been developed for the treatment ofhuman systemic lupus erythematosus, modication of hyperacuterenal xenograft rejection, transplantcandidates, and treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia withmonoclonal lipoproteins 1979b; Hakim et 1990; Wingard et al, 1991; Yang et al. , 2004). 10.3. Basic Principle of Articial Cell in Hemoperfusion Permeability and transport characteristics An articial cell membrane has an ultrathin membrane of less than 0.05 micron as compared to the 2.0 micron thickness of the dialysismembrane. Furthermore, the small size of articial cells means thatApril 2, 2007 Regenerative... ch10 Hemoperfusion in Poisoning, Kidney Failure, Liver Failure, and Immunology 259 Table 1.

This means that 30 ml of articial cells can havea theoretical mass transfer that is 100 to 200 times that of a wholearticial kidney machine (Chang, 1966, 1972a) (Table 1). We also analyzed the effects of varying the diameter and total volume of articial cells over a wide range. Figure 10. 2 comparesthe mass transfer of articial cells with that of a standard hemodialysis Fig. 10.2. Mass transfer articial kidney represented as 1. Ratio of mass transfer of 10 ml and 300 ml of articial cells of different diameters.Hemoperfusion uses articial cells of Regenerative... ch10 FA 260 Articial Cells machine. Here, the mass transfer of a standard hemodialysis machine is taken as unity and comparison is made of 10 ml and 300 ml of articialcells of different mean diameters. The mass transfer of even a 10 ml ofarticial cells is many times that of the standard hemodialysis machine. With 300 ml of articial cells, the mass transfer is even higher. Experimental analysis An experimental study of typical articial cells has shown that the equivalent pore radius is 18 A (Chang, 1965, 1972a). This means that the membrane would be permeable not only to the smallerwaste metabolites but also to the \"middle\" molecules in the 1000-25,000 molecular weight range. A detailed analysis of the rate ofmovement of different molecules has also been carried out (Changand Poznansky, 1968a) (Table 2). These results show that metabolitesnormally present in the body can equilibrate very rapidly across thearticial cell membranes. This being the case, 30 ml of articial cellsretained in a shunt perfused by circulating blood will have a masstransfer equivalent to that of a whole articial kidney machine (Chang,1966) (Figs. 10.1 and 10.2). However, in the case of the articial kidneymachine, once solutes cross the membrane they are \"washed\" away by100-200 liters of dialysis fluid. For articial cells with a total internalvolume of 30 ml, within a very short time, the concentration gradient Table 2. Experimental Permeability Data for Articial Cells Regenerative... ch10 Hemoperfusion in Poisoning, Kidney Failure, Liver Failure, and Immunology 261 will disappear for any further solute diffusion. However, articial cells are not meant to function as dialyzers. They are made to function asmicroscopic bioreactors, so that, solutes entering the articial cells canbe rapidly converted or removed, thus maintaining a concentrationgradient. Thus, our earlier study showed that articial cells containingurease in a hemoperfusion chamber can rapidly lower blood urea byconverting it to ammonium (Chang 1966). Adsorbents, like activatedcharcoal, placed inside articial cell can also remove solutes thatequilibrate rapidly inside (Chang, 1966). Why do we choose to useactivated charcoal? 10.4. Articial Cells Containing Activated Charcoal in Hemoperfusion Why use activated charcoal for articial cell hemoperfusion? Activated charcoal has the ability to adsorb and remove a large spectrum of molecules. Since ancient times, the Chinese and Greekshave used this for removing toxic substances. Activated charcoal hasalso been placed in a hemoperfusion device for direct perfusion byblood (Yatzidas, 1964). However, Dunea and Kolff (1965) showed inanimal studies that this resulted in: 1) embolism due to the release ofcharcoal powder into the body, and 2) damage and removal of bloodcells especially platelets. By putting activated charcoal inside articial cells one can prevent the release of harmful charcoal particles into the body and at thesame time prevent its adverse effects on the blood cells (Chang, 1966)(Fig. 10.1). At the same time, unwanted molecules can move rapidlyinto the articial cells and be removed by the activated charcoal. In order to put this into practice, articial cells were rst prepared to contain activated charcoal powder (Chang, 1966). However, ina hemoperfusion device, the ultrathin membrane of the articialcells cannot withstand the larger pressure gradient during perfusion.Furthermore, the flexibility of the ultrathin membrane increases flowresistance and also packing and obstruction at the exit port of thehemoperfusion device. A more successful method is to coat theApril 2, 2007 15:50 SPI-B446 Articial 262 Articial Cells ultrathin membrane directly onto activated charcoal granules (Chang, 1969a). Thus, there is no breakage of the ultrathin membrane, noincrease in flow resistance and no obstruction to flow. This forms thebasis of all the subsequent successful approaches. Later, industrialproductions of medical grade spherical activated charcoal help tofurther improve this method. Effects on embolism In vitro studies show that there is no particle release since there is no signicant differences in particle counts between the samplesfrom the fluid entering the hemoperfusion devices and that from thefluid leaving the device (Chang and Malave, 1970). In animal studies,blood smear from blood leaving the device did not show any embolicparticles. Histological studies in a total of more than 20 dogs did notshow any evidence of embolism, even in articial cell hemoperfusiondevices stored for up to one month (Chang and Malave, 1970). Effects of hemoperfusion on platelets Figures 10.3 and 10.4 show that uncoated activated charcoal aftercontact with heparinized blood, when observed under a scanningelectron microscope, showed brin entrapment of red blood cells,leukocytes and platelets. On the other hand, articial cells in the formof albumin-cellulose nitrate-coated activated charcoal granules did notshow brin entrapment of formed elements of blood (Chang, 1974b). This scanning electron microscopic study supported the nding that albumin-cellulose nitrate-coated activated charcoal, used in bothanimal studies (Chang, 1969; 1974b; Chang and Malave, 1970) andpatients (Chang et al., 1972a), prevents the depletion of platelets from the blood. There is no hemolysis or removal of red blood cells bythe albumin-cellulose nitrate-coated activated charcoal. Unlike otherpolymers, cellulose nitrate can bind albumin tightly by adsorption evenin the presence of plasma. There were no signicant changes in post-hemoperfusion plasma hemoglobin levels or Regenerative... ch10 Hemoperfusion in Poisoning, Kidney Failure, Liver Failure, and Immunology 263 Fig. 10.3. Left: Uncoated activated charcoal after contact with heparinized blood observed under a scanning electron microscope, showed brinentrapment of red blood cells, leukocytes and platelets. Right : On the other hand, articial cells in the form of albumin-cellulose nitrate-coated activatedcharcoal granules did not show brin entrapment of elements ofblood. Clearance of the ACAC articial cell articial kidney On the basis of the mass transfer analysis (Table 1 and Fig. 10.2) one should not be too surprised at the very high clearance value of articialcells containing activated charcoal. Activated charcoal activelyremoves and adsorb substances that rapidly cross the membrane.Furthermore, the albumin coating of the articial cell membranes alsotakes part in the removal of protein-bound molecules in the circulation. As a result, the clearance of the different metabolites or drugs is many times higher than that for the standard hemodialysis machines. For instance, as shown inTable 3, creatinine clearance is 230 ml/min as compared to 120 ml/min for standard hemodialysis machines. Whatis even more important is the clearance for \"middle\" moleculeswhich is 140 ml/min as compared to 30 ml/min with the standardhemodialysis machines (available up to 1980). The clearance of drugslike phenobarbiturate, methaprylon, methaqualone and glutethimideof between 210 to 230 ml/min is even more striking when comparedApril 2, 2007 Articial 264 Articial Cells Fig. 10.4. Platelet levels in patients before and after 2 h of hemoperfusion using albumin-cellulose nitrated coated activated charcoal articial cells. There is no signicant decrease in platelet level. Earlier report elsewhere using nature activated charcoal without membrane coating resulted in markeddecrease in platelet levels. to the much lower clearance in the standard hemodialysis machines. The clearance of protein-bound molecules, as glutethimide, is many times higher using articial cell hemoperfusion. On the other hand, itshould be noted that the clearance depends a great deal on the abilityof the charcoal to adsorb the material that crosses the articial cellmembranes. Thus, in the case of blood urea and electrolytes whichare not adsorbed to any extent by the charcoal, small clearanceis obtained.April 2, 2007 Regenerative... ch10 Hemoperfusion in Poisoning, Kidney Failure, Liver Failure, and Immunology 265 Table 3.

Right : Inflow into the narrow end of the device resulted in improved flow hyrodynamic with lesschanneling and less stagnation of flow closer to the wall of the device. Improvements in hydrodynamics The laboratory ACAC hemoperfusion device as shown in Fig. 10.1 has congurations and inflow characteristics that allow for goodhydrodynamics. However, this conguration is not convenient forindustrial scale up. For industrial scale up, the conguration is alsoApril 2, 2007 Regenerative... ch10 FA 266 Articial Cells shown in Fig. 10.1. In this conguration, it is necessary to analyze the optimal hydrodynamics (Victor Chang et al. , 1987a). Figure 10.5 shows the hydrodynamic measurements of flow with the congurationof the industrial scaled up ACAC hemoperfusion device. When inflowenters the larger end of the device (left gure), there is channelingand stagnation of flow near the wall. This decreases the efciencyof extraction of unwanted molecules from the fluid. Furthermore, this can contribute to deposition of platelets and white cells. When inflow enters the narrow end of the device, there is improved flowhyrodynamic with less channeling and less stagnation of flow close tothe wall of the device. 10.5. Hemoperfusion in Acute Suicidal or Accidental Poisoning Preclinical studies Animal studies in this laboratory showed the effectiveness of the hemoperfusion system in the treatment of acute intoxication fromglutethimide, pentobarbital and salicylate (Chang, 1972a). This led toour clinical trials in patients. First clinical trials in acute poisoning Other physicians at that time were not willing to carry out theprocedure because of the potential for liability. As a result, I had toprepare the hemoperfusion devices in my laboratory at McGill, andto bring each of them to the hospital to treat the patients myself. Thearrangement was that the nephrologists would refer patients to me. Iwould then make the nal decision based on the following criteria. Forthe rst 3 adult patients, I would only agree to carry out the proceduresif the patients were seriously intoxicated, with a systemic drug levelwell above the lethal levels or who had serious complications requiringrapid recovery from the effects of the drugs. For example, in one case,before treatment the patient had cardiac arrests on two occasions withApril 2, 2007 15:50 SPI-B446 Regenerative... ch10 Hemoperfusion in Poisoning, Kidney Failure, Liver Failure, and Immunology 267 possible pulmonary embolism requiring heparinization. Her blood pressure was not obtainable by auscultation and her methyprylon levelwas twice the lethal level. In this particular case, the desirability ofrapid elimination of the drug and its effects is obvious. In anothercase, a combined intoxication existed \u2014 the methyprylon level wasthree times, and the methaqualone level at least twice, the lethal level;furthermore, it is well known that glutethimide is cleared poorly bythe standard articial kidney available at that time. In the case of apediatric patient with accidental theophylline overdose, irreversiblebrain damage would have been the result if treatment was not startedimmediately. In all these cases, the potential benets to the patientswould have to be high. Result of clinical trials on 11 adult patients with suicidal or accidental drug poisoning The rst three patients are described in more detail below (Chang et al., 1973a, 1973b), to followed by the other adult patients (Chang 1975g,1976c, 1980e) and then the pediatric patient. Case 1. A 50-year-old female, previously treated for depression, was admitted consequent upon her taking several drugs. She wascomatose and her blood pressure was 90 /60, pulse 80 /min and regular, respiration 12/min and temperature, 98.4 F. Her corneal reflexes were absent. She was treated by intubation followed by gastriclavage containing activated charcoal. Heparin, 5000 units IV q4h, wasstarted since pulmonary embolism was suspected. Four hours latertwo cardiac arrests occurred and were reversed with cardiac massageand direct current electroshock. A subsequent chest X-ray showedfracture of four ribs.Ventilatory assistance was required.Ten hours afteradmission her blood pressure could not be determined by auscultation. At this time her blood methyprylon level was 9.4 mg/dl and six hours later it was 9.6 mg/dl. Direct measurement of arterial blood pressurefrom the AV shunt gave a systolic pressure of 80 mm Hg. The patient was referred to me and hemoperfusion was carried out. For the rst 20 min the systolic blood pressure was maintained at 90-100 mm Hg with levarterenol. Then the levarterenol 010 10.6. Clinical and laboratory results of hemoperfusion in a patient with severe suicidal methryprylon overdose. and the pressure remained at 130-150 mm Hg throughout the 3 h of hemoperfusion. The initial arterial blood methyprylon level was9.6 mg/dl. Hemoperfusion for 2 h lowered this to 4.1 mg/dl, i.e. belowthe dangerous level of 6 mg/dl (Fig. 10.6). An initial clearance of250 ml/min was obtained. As a result, the recovery was dramaticand straightforward. For example, voluntary respiration became moreregular and increased to 40/min, with tidal volume increasing to325 ml during hemoperfusion. Corneal reflexes and voluntary eyeopening and blinking returned and response to painful stimuliappeared. Limb movements were detected 27 h after admissionand 4 h later, the patient responded to verbal commands. Sheno longer required ventilatory assistance and started talking 4 hlater. Case 2. A 26-year-old female was admitted after ingesting a large amount of glutethimide. She was comatose and areflexic. Her bloodpressure was 90/60 and she required ventilatory support. Six hoursafter admission, her systolic blood pressure was less than 70 mm Hgand isoproterenol was infused. Twenty-four hours after admission, hercondition was unchanged. Her rectal temperature was 87 F, bloodApril 2, 2007 15:50 SPI-B446 Regenerative... ch10 Poisoning, Kidney Failure, Liver Failure, and Immunology 269GLUTETHIMIDE (mg/dl) 08 0 SPONT OFF RESPIRATOR CONSCIOUS Fig. 10.7. Clinical and laboratory results of hemoperfusion in a patient with severe suicidal glutethimide overdose. pressure 90/50, and she still required isoproterenol and ventilatory support. At that time, she had clinical and X-ray signs of bilateralbronchopneumonia. Her blood glutethimide level was 7 mg/dl. At 27 h after admission, she was referred to me. She was treated by hemoperfusion with 300 g of the ACAC microcapsules for 2 h.In the course of the hemoperfusion, her blood pressure rose from90/50 to 120/80 in 30 min without isoproterenol infusion. Herblood glutethimide level fell to 3 mg/dl, but 10 h after completionof the hemoperfusion, it rose to 5 mg/dl (Fig. 10.7). Except for avery slight pupillary reflex and gag reflex, she remained comatose.Her blood pressure was 110/55. Since glutethimide has a highlipid coefcient, a large part of the drug accumulated in the lipoidtissue. The rebound in its level after hemoperfusion likely reflects aredistribution of glutethimide from the lipoid tissue to the bloodstream. A second hemoperfusion with another 300 g of ACAC microcapsules was carried out. Within 1 h, a 2+ patellar reflex and a slight plantarApril 2, Regenerative... 270 Articial Cells reflex were elicited. After 1\u00bd h of hemoperfusion, her tidal volume increased from 250 ml (pretreatment) to 475 ml. In addition, sheexhibited some spontaneous limb movements. Her blood pressureincreased to 130/75. The posthemoperfusion blood glutethimide levelwas 1.5 mg/dl (Fig. 10.6). Two hours after completion of the secondhemoperfusion, she no longer required ventilatory support. She wasup and about the following day. Case 3. A 27-year-old male was admitted consequent upon his ingesting a mixture of medications. He was comatose andunresponsive to painful stimuli and required ventilatory assistance. Healso showed signs of methaqualone intoxication: tonic convulsions,hypotension, cardiac failure, myoclonia, bleeding tendency, andhypothermia. Gastric lavage was carried out and forced diuresisstarted. Eight hours after admission, his blood methyprylon level was18.3 mg/dl, 3 times the \"dangerous\" level of 6 mg/dl. A 60-min ACAChemoperfusion was carried out at a blood flow rate of 300 ml/min. Themethyprylon level fell to 12.9 mg/dl after the 60-min treatment and by32 h after admission, it was 9.0 mg/dl having been lowered from threetimes the dangerous level to just below the dangerous level. Despitethis, there was no marked immediate improvement in the patient'sclinical condition. At that time, the laboratory result showed that healso had a methaqualone level of 6.5 mg/dl, a level which is more thantwice the dangerous level of 2.5 mg/dl. A second ACAC hemoperfusionwas given over a period of 2 h with a blood flow rate of 300 ml/min.Themethyprylon and methaqualone level fell to 1.8 mg/dl and 2.7 mg/dl,respectively. By 48 h his pupils reacted sluggishly to light, and the gagreflex, deep pain response and bowel sounds were present. At 96 hhis breathing was independent; all reflexes became normal. By 130 hafter admission, he was oriented, rational and up and about. Case 4. This patient was admitted comatose, areflexic, with xed dilated pupils, and requiring respiratory assist and pressor drug tomaintain her blood pressure. She had taken a large mixture ofdrugs, including glutethimide, thioridazine, salicylate, phenobarbital,and tetracycline, in addition to a large intake of alcohol. She wasApril 2, 2007 15:50 SPI-B446 Regenerative... ch10 Hemoperfusion in Poisoning, Kidney Failure, Liver Failure, and Immunology 271 hemodialyzed three times in the rst 48 h with no change in her condition. She was hemoperfused for 1-1/2 h with 300 g of ACAC,followed immediately by another 300 g of ACAC hemoperfusioncolumn for 1 h. With this hemoperfusion, her corneal reflex returnedand her blood pressure could be maintained without pressor drug. Inthe next 2 days, she was treated by two hemodialyses but withoutany changes in her clinical condition. A third hemoperfusion wascarried out 10 h after the last hemodialysis. With this hemoperfusion,gag reflex and cough reflex returned and there was occasionalspontaneous breathing. This was followed by a fourth hemoperfusionafter which spontaneous breathing returned. The following day, shewas responsive and following this, she recovered and was up andabout. Her phenobarbital level was 20 mg% on admission. Clearanceobtained 228.6 mL/min. Her glutethimide level on admission was22.62 mg/dl. Clearance obtained was 251 mL/min. Case 5. A 79-year-old patient was admitted with a history of ingestion of phenobarbital with a blood level of 30 mg%. Thepatient was comatose, areflexic, and required ventilatory assist whenhemoperfusion was carried out. With 2 h of hemoperfusion, pupilreflex, corneal reflex, and patellar reflex returned. Later, the patientstarted to trigger the respirator, had spontaneous movement andrecovered shortly after this. Clearance obtained for hemoperfusion ata blood flow rate of 200 mL/min was 188 mL/min. Case 6. This patient was admitted with grade IV coma due to phenobarbital intoxication.The patient received ACAC hemoperfusionat 180-200 mL/min blood flow rate. The clearance was 162 mL/min.Hemoperfusion resulted in recovery of the patient. Case 7. This 21-year-old patient was admitted with a history of ingestion of glutethimide and phenobarbital. She was admitted withgrade IV coma.There was X-ray evidence of right upper lobe atelectasisand right lower lobe consolidation. One 2 h hemoperfusion resultedin improvement of the patient and complete recovery and dischargesubsequently.April 2, 2007 15:50 SPI-B446 Articial 272 Articial Cells Case 8. This 22-year-old man was admitted with a history of overdose of salicylate and sodium bromide. The salicylate level was 52.85 mg%when hemoperfusion was started. The clearance obtained at theflow rate of 300 mL/min was 165.9 mL/min. Hemoperfusion of 2 hlowered level to 37.76 mg%. At initiationof hemoperfusion, the patient was in grade II coma responding topainful stimuli. After 1 h of hemoperfusion, the patient recoveredconsciousness, complained of thirst and hunger, wanted to get up andwas also carrying on a conversation. He recovered after this. Case 9. This 51-year-old patient had taken an overdose of methyprylon. The patient was comatose, areflexic, hypotensive, and needed ventilatory assistance. He received 2 h of hemoperfusion with ACAChemoperfusion at a blood flow rate of 160 mL/min. Two hours afterhemoperfusion was started there was bilateral patellar reflex 2+,ankle reflex 2+, light reflex, and some voluntary movement. Shortlyafterwards ventilatory assistance was not required and he recoveredshortly after this. Case 10. This 30-year-old patient was admitted with a history of having taken phencyclidine. Phencyclidine was qualitatively demonstrated inthe blood and urine of the patient.The patient was comatose, areflexic,hypotensive, and a 2 h ACAC hemoperfusion was carried out. Afterthe hemoperfusion, the patient still remained comatose. Three dayslater the patient was off the respiratory and started to have voluntarymovements and then recovered after this. It is not possible to measurethe phencyclidine level quantitatively, in order to calculate clearanceor changes in level because the method available at that time couldonly give a qualitative assessment of the presence of phencyclidine inthe blood and urine. Case 11. This 55-year-old patient was admitted after he had taken a bottle of Seconal (secobarbital). Shortly after admission, he developedrespiratory arrest. He was resuscitated, put on a respirator, and hisblood pressure was maintained with pressor drug. He developedventricular tachycardia which responded to lidocaine. His secobarbitallevel was 6 mg%.

After 1 h of hemoperfusion, there was 2 +achilles tendon reflex. And 2 h after hemoperfusion, both patellar achilles reflexes were present. Two dayslater he recovered completely and was transferred out of the intensivecare unit. This hemoperfusion was carried out with the Hemosorbasystem and the clearance obtained was 200 mL/min. Pediatric patient with accidental theophylline overdose A 3-year, 10-month female child with a two-year history of asthma developed tachynea, respiratory difculty and fever. She wasaccidentally given 750 mg of theophylline, an amount 10 times inexcess of that prescribed. She became restless, developed tachycardia,and vomited coffee-ground material positive for occult blood. Herserum theophylline level was 67 \u00b5g/ml 1 h and 45 min after being given the drug. She was transferred to the intensive care unit. Thehospital immediately referred the patient to me for possible treatmentwith ACAC hemoperfusion. It was decided to carry out the procedureimmediately because: 1) The theophylline level varied from Articial Cells 74\u00b5g/ml and 40 \u00b5g/ml being considered a potentially lethal dose; (2) It is known that if the level is not lowered quickly, the child wouldsuffer irreversible brain damage \u2014 as in an earlier case when the childwas referred to us too late; and (3) Available dialysis systems at thattime were not effective in removing theophylline. A 3 h hemoperfusion procedure was carried out (Chang et al. , 1980a). The maximal blood flow possible in this 15.4 kg child was 60-75 ml/min in the rst hour. After the rst hour, the flow rate was increased to 90 ml/min, and this rate was maintained for the remainderof the treatment. Before hemoperfusion, the child had a tachycardiaof 187/min and a blood pressure of 120/70 mm Hg. As hemoperfusionlowered the systemic theophylline level, the heart rate decreased to145/min at one hour, 135/min at two hours and was 127/min at theend of the procedure (Fig. 10.8). Her blood pressure was unchangedthroughout the hemoperfusion. Hours after theophyllineHeart rates/min Theophylline conc (\u00b5g/ml)HP systemic efferent190 120 80 0 0 14 Fig. 10.8.

The theophylline level in the efferent from the hemoperfusion device waszero showing a 100% extract of the drug on one circulation throughthe device. The removal of the drug from the tissue compartmentmust also have been high since before hemoperfuion the blood levelremained high and stable but after hemoperfusion was completed, theserum level continued to remain at the low level. The child recovereduneventfully. Routine clinical uses in patients around the world Activated charcoal is a well-known adsorbent for a large number of drugs and toxins. Articial cells containing activated charcoal, asdemonstrated here, take advantage of this adsorbing property and atthe same time prevents the two major problems of charcoal embolismand reduction in platelets. The results of these initial clinical trialshave led to the use of this approach around the world for the treatmentof patients with accidental or suicidal poisoning (Better et al. , 1979; Biberstein Piskin & Chang, 1982; Chang Zheng, 1983; Chang 1985;Chang & , Peng et al. , 2004; Chinese symposium in hemoperfusion, 2005). The methods of preparation of articial cells containing activated charcoal have been published in reproducible for all to use (Chang,1972a). As a result, a number of countries have started to producetheir own industrial hemoperfusion devices. As would be expected,there are variations and extension of Chang's original method, resultingin variations in efcacy and biocompatibility. While the inferior onesare no longer in use, those that are safe and effective are being usedin routine clinical treatment of accidental and suicidal poisoning.

Intoxication with agents producing metabolic and/or delayed effects.6. Intoxication with an extractable drug which can be removed at a greater rate than endogenous elimination some areas of the world, for some unknown reasons, these devices are extremely expensive and as a result are not in widespread use.In other areas of the world, especially where hemodialysis machinesare not easily accessible, inexpensive but safe and efcient devicesare being produced and used extensively. Nephrologists have beenable to establish the following criteria for using this in acute poisoning(Table 6), based on the extensive experience in the use of adsorbentarticial cells in hemoperfusion for acute poisoning. Because of its efcient adsorbing properties for numerous drugs (Table 5), the system may be even more useful in cases of acuteintoxication involving a number or drugs, especially when the exactdrugs are not known at the time that treatment is required. Beingportable and having a constant extracorporeal volume, it is particularlyuseful in areas where hemodialysis machines are not easily accessibleor in pediatric practices. 10.6. Hemoperfusion in Terminal Renal Failure Patients Hemodialysis machines are effective in the treatment of chronic renalfailure patients. However, at that time there were not enough machines;furthermore, it was extremely expensive. Only a small number ofpatients could afford treatment in a few countries. In most othercountries, the high cost and unavailability of machines posed a barrierto their use in terminal renal failure patients. Since hemoperfusionis efcient in removing toxin or unwanted waste from the blood, wecarried out studies into its possible use in uremic patients.April 2, 2007 Regenerative... ch10 in Poisoning, Kidney Failure, Liver Failure, and Immunology 277Table 6. Drugs and Chemicals removed with Regenerative... ch10 FA 278 Articial Cells This author has carried out 55 hemoperfusion procedures in 14 patients (Table 7). Initially, only one hemoperfusion procedure wascarried out on each of four terminal renal failure patients. Havingshown the safety of this procedure, two hemoperfusions were carriedout on the 5th patient and three procedures were then carried outon each of the next three patients. After this, a 72-year-old female,who could not be managed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysiswas placed on an 8 month regime of hemoperfusions, supplementedwith hemodialysis as required for the removal of urea, water, andelectrolytes. Long-term hemoperfusion in this patient was safe andeffective and her condition was stabilized sufciently for her to bemaintained on standard dialysis for the next 10 years. This led to theinclusion of other patients for long-term hemoperfusion. Until commercial devices became available, the number of patients who could be treated was limited. This is because I had to prepare thedevice and then carry out the procedures in the patients. To allow forobjective clinical assessment, I was responsible for the preparation ofthe hemoperfusion device and the carrying out of the procedures onpatients. A group of nephrologists would refer the patients to me andthey would independently assess the clinical and laboratory results. Table 7.

The standardchronic hemodialysis program at that time was for each patient toreceive an average of two 6 h-hemodialyses each week, usually on theEX 01 hemodialyzer. 10.7. Hemoperfusion Alone Supplemented by Hemodialysis General clinical results No adverse effects from hemoperfusions were observed in the patients. There was little or no change in blood pressure throughout the hemoperfusion procedure, even in patients who normally experiencedsevere hypotensive episodes when on the EX 01 hemodialyzers.Immediately after the 2 h hemoperfusion, the patients felt much lessfatigued than when they underwent the 6 h hemodialysis with the EX 01articial kidney. This is especially in a patient who normally stayedhome in the evening to rest after the 6 h EX 01 hemodialysis treatment.On the other hand , 1 h after the 2 h ACAC hemoperfusion, she would go out for dinner, social visits, or the theater. At the initiation of theclinical trial, each patient receiving a hemoperfusion was required tostay in the hospital overnight for observation before being allowed toreturn home the next day. When the procedure was found to be safe,the patients treated with the hemoperfusion procedure were allowedto go home 1 h after hemoperfusion. The patients' general well-beingwas at least as good on the weekly 2 h ACAC hemoperfusion and 6 hhemodialysis (EX 01) as on the twice weekly 6 h EX 01 hemodialysis. The following are examples of patients on longer term treatment with hemoperfusion. First patient on long-term hemoperfusion This is a 72-year-old female with chronic renal failure and congestive heart failure. She was admitted with complaints of nausea, vomiting,April 2, 2007 15:50 SPI-B446 Articial Regenerative... ch10 280 Articial Cells low back pain, diarrhea and hiccups. She was bedridden in the hospital, with a BUN of 186 mg/dl,creatinine of 24 mg/dl,and a 24 hcreatinine excretion of 80 mg. She was placed on peritoneal dialysisbut this resulted in massive intra-abdominal bleeding and severe shock.Hemodialysis treatment resulted in hypotension. She was referredto this author since there was no other way to treat her condition. At that time, because of lack of facilities, patients of her age were not generally accepted into long-term hemodialysis program. Thus, I rst had the assurance of the dialysis unit that if she improved onthe hemoperfusion program, the dialysis unit would accept her onthe standard dialysis program. For the next 50 days, she underwenthemoperfusion procedures, each lasting for 2 h. During this 50 days,she received only one hemodialysis for the removal of water andelectrolytes. After that, she continued for a total of eight monthson hemoperfusion combined with hemodialysis. The schedule oftreatment and response for the rst 50 days of her 8-month treatmenton hemoperfusion are summarized in Fig. 10.9.

(D \u2014dialysis; H \u2014 hemoperfusion.)April 2, Regenerative... ch10 Hemoperfusion in Poisoning, Kidney Failure, Liver Failure, and Immunology 281 With this regime, her uremic symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hiccups cleared. Surprisingly, after two weeks on thisregime, she felt well enough to be allowed by the nephrologists toleave the hospital and return home. During that time, she no longerhad uremic symptoms and was able to do shopping and housework. At the beginning, she was asked to stay in the hospital for 24 h after each procedure. Later, she only came to the hospital 1 h before her hemoperfusion and then returned home 1 h after completion of the hemoperfusion. There were no side effects throughout all herhemoperfusions. There was little or no change in her blood pressure,and no other clinical side effects. This is contrary to her standardhemodialysis treatment with the EX 01 when she had hypotensiveepisodes with hemodialysis especially during fluid removal. After the 50 days period, the dialysis unit admitted her to on a half time basis with one 6-h hemodialysis per week, and a 2 hhemoperfusion per week. During the 8-month period, she receiveda total of 24 hemoperfusion procedures and all were uneventful withno side effects.The only problem was fluid retention, as hemoperfusiondoes not remove fluid. After a total of 8 months on the hemoperfusionprogram, she was placed on a standard two weekly 6-h hemodialysisprogram for the next 10 years until she passed away at over 80 years ofage. Independent inquiry by the nephrologists showed that her feelingof well-being was the same when she was on an average weekly regimeof 2 h hemoperfusion plus 6-h hemodialysis comparable to her twicea week 6-h hemodialysis. Thus, 2 h on hemoperfusion seems to be aseffective as 6 h of hemodialysis. A 51-year-old female patient had a long history of hypertension and chronic renal failure caused by chronic pyelonephritis. Her urineoutput remained at about 500 ml/day with creatinine excretion of0.4 gm/24 h. She was started on occasional peritoneal dialysis andthen on 6 h twice weekly EX 01 hemodialysis while waiting for renaltransplantation. She developed severe pruritis which disturbed hersleep at night and which was a nuisance during the day. Becauseof this, she was started on hemoperfusion to treat her pruritis. Shecontinued on the 6-h twice weekly hemodialysis program with theaddition of a 2 h weekly hemoperfusion. This treatment resulted inApril 2, 2007 Regenerative... ch10 282 Articial Cells a marked decrease of her pruritis. In addition, her acceptance of the hemoperfusion procedure was such that she was placed onthe long-term hemoperfusion regime of one 2 h hemoperfusion plusone 6-h EX 01 hemodialysis weekly. In addition to her diminishedpruritis she found that with hemoperfusion she could come in 1 hbefore hemoperfusion, have a 2 h ACAC hemoperfusion and after thetreatment, felt well enough to go directly to social evenings, dancing,or playing cards with her friends. On the other hand, with the EX 01hemodialysis, she felt tired and had to rest at home in the evening.Furthermore, she experienced cramps in her legs during or soon aftereach 6-h EX 01 hemodialysis. She remained symptom-free and with nopruritis on the hemoperfusion and hemodialysis program for 4 months. After this, she returned to the standard hemodialysis program because one hemodialysis each week was not enough to control her body fluid. A 53-year-old male with chronic renal failure was started on a 6 h twice weekly EX 01 hemodialysis. His daily urine output was 1 literand creatinine excretion was 0.5 gm, respectively. He was started ona weekly 2 h hemoperfusion and 6-h EX 01 hemodialysis program.Being a very active business man, he accepted this program because itmeant that on the day of treatment with hemoperfusion, he could workin the morning, have his lunch and come in for treatment, then returnin the same afternoon, sometimes to work further in the evening. Atthe end of three weeks, he received a renal transplant. A 21-year-old male was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of cramps, headaches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. His creatinineclearance was 1.6 ml/min and urinary output, 700 ml/day. This patient,with spina bida at birth, was paraplegic with a neurogenic bladder,recurring urinary tract infection, and acute pyelonephritis. At that time,there was no opening for him in the chronic hemodialysis programand he was not considered suitable for renal transplantation. Thepatient was treated with 2 h of hemoperfusion weekly, supplementedby very occasional hemodialysis as needed for control of fluid andelectrolytes. This treatment resulted in marked improvement of thepatient's symptoms \u2014 except for occasional diarrhea. He was wellenough to return to work. Three months later, an opening becameavailable in the chronic hemodialysis unit and the patient was treatedApril 2, 2007 Regenerative... ch10 Hemoperfusion in Poisoning, Kidney Failure, Liver Failure, and Immunology 283 with an average of once a week 2 h hemoperfusion plus once a week 6 h hemodialysis. After a total of 6 months on hemoperfusion, thepatient continued to be symptom-free. There was improvement innerve conduction velocity. Each 2 h hemoperfusion lowered the (300-1500 mol. wt.) level by 55%. He functionedwell and was able to work and swim. The only problem was that onehemodialysis per week was not enough to prevent fluid retention.Thus,after 6 months on this program he was placed on the standard twice aweek hemodialysis program. Hemoperfusion and removal of hemoperfusion industrially. Figure 10.10 shows that the betterhemoperfusion devices are much more effective than the dialysersavailable at that time for the removal of uremic metabolites as shownby the clearance for creatinine, uric acid and \"middle\" molecules. Also, with the better hemoperfusion system like ACAC and Adsorba 300C, there was no signicant effect on the platelet levels. 10.8. Conjoint Hemoperfusion-Hemodialysis The above results show that hemoperfusion is capable of removing toxin or unwanted waste metabolite and maintain patients symptom-free. On the other hand, the above clinical results also show thathemoperfusion, even with occasional hemodialysis, cannot deal withelectrolytes or fluid retention. It has been strongly proposed that \"middle\" molecular weight sub- stances, including -2-microglobulin (11,800 m.w.), may be responsible for the uremic symptoms. However, the hemodialysismembrane available at that time had a very low clearance for \"middle\"molecules and required up to 8 h for effective removal. On the otherhand, the better hemoperfusion devices are much more efcient inremoving \"middle\" molecules (Tables 2 and Articial Cells Fig. 10.10. Clinical studies in uremic patients show that middle molecules can be lowered rapidly after 2 h of ACAC hemoperfusion. On the other hand,hemodialysis machines available at that time was not effective. Table 8.

(Chang et al. , 1975;April 2, 2007 Regenerative... ch10 Hemoperfusion in Poisoning, Kidney Failure, Liver Failure, and Immunology 285 Table 9. Effects of Hemoperfusion in Uremic Patients Authors Clinical Imp rovements in the following Symptoms Chang et al. , 1971-1974 Pruritis, well-being, nausea, vomiting Chang et al. Peripheral neuropathy Odaka et al. , 1978 Pericarditis, symptom free Chang et al. , 1979 Hematocrit Martin et al. , 1979 Pericarditis Inou al. , 1980; Stefoni et al. , 1980). The use of the better commercially prepared hemoperfusion devices in series with hemodialyzers resultedin clinical improvements in patients' well being, nerve conductionvelocity, pruritis, pericarditis, peripheral neuropathy and what is alsoimportant, reduction in treatment time (Table 9) (Chang et al. , 1975; 1982b; Martin et al., , 1980; Stefoni et al. , 1980). These clinical trial results led many centers to use the combined hemoperfusion-hemodialysis, especiallyin those patients with resistant uremic symptoms under the standardhemodialysis program. Since then, the quality of hemodialysis membranes has improved so that the present high flux membranes are better than the standarddialysis membrane in removing the larger \"middle\" molecules.Even then, the clearance is still much less compared to thebetter hemoperfusion devices. Hemoperfusion devices are usuallymanufactured by manufacturers of hemodialysis machines andmembrane. In those countries with strong hemodialysis companies, thehemoperfusion devices are extremely expensive. On the other hand,in these countries with no large dialysis industries, hemoperfusiondevices are not expensive and therefore continued to be used inrenal failure patients. In all the countries, hemoperfusion continuesto be commonly used for uremic patients with aluminium or ironoverload. This is based on the earlier clinical demonstration of theApril 2, 2007 15:50 SPI-B446 Articial 286 Articial Cells use of deferoxamine to bind these heavy metals and of hemoperfusion to remove the complex (Chang and Barre, 1983; Chang, 1986d; Changet al. , 1984a, 1996). 10.9. Miniaturized Articial Kidney Based on Hemoperfusion-Ultraltration A third approach is to construct a truly miniaturized articial kidney based on hemoperfusion in series with small ultraltrator (Chang et al., 1975, 1979a, 1977b, Chang, 1976c) (Fig. 10.9). In clinical studies, asmall Amicon ultratiltrator was used (Fig. 10.11). Hydrostatic pressurefrom the blood pump alone gave effective ultraltration. Dialysis fluidis not required, the ultraltrate flowing directly into a measuringcylinder. This ultraltrator in series with ACAC hemoperfusion was studied in two patients, one for three and the other for six months. Thepatient, treated for 6 months, had a creatinine clearance of 0.2 mL/min Fig. 10.11. ACAC hemoperfusion in series with a 2, Regenerative... ch10 Hemoperfusion in Poisoning, Kidney Failure, Liver Failure, and Immunology 287 and a urine volume of 50 ml/day. He was followed for a 6-month control period of thrice weekly hemodialysis treatments. This wasfollowed by a 6-month test period when a 2.5 h hemoperfusion-ultraltration replaced one of the 6 h three weekly hemodialysistreatments (Fig. 10.12). The patient felt well throughout. Hematocrit increased slightly from 25.15% \u00b13.61 to 26.6% \u00b11.73. Fluid retentions diminished as body weight fell from 82.6 \u00b11.2 to the optimal dry weight of 78.0 \u00b10.8 kg and hypertension improved. More fluid could be removed without side effects in 2.5 h of hemoperfusion-ultraltration comparedto 6 h of hemodialysis. \"Middle\" molecule clearance in this patient was113 mL/min at a blood flow rate (QB) of 200 ml/min and 160 mL/min at Control Test Post-test 6 months 6 months 6 months Hematocrit BUN Creatinine Uric acid Body weight (dry K meq/L10 0180 12020 0100 030% 0 Fig. 10.12.

Hemoperfusion-ultraltration wasmore effective hemodialysis in removing \"middle\" molecules,creatinine, uric acid, sodium chloride and water (Table 10). On theother hand, it did not remove sufcient potassium and urea since after6 months on this regime, there was an increase in mean blood ureanitrogen from 86 \u00b114 mg/dl to 105 \u00b118 to 5.8 \u00b10.08 mEq/l. Oral adsorbents can remove potassium and phosphate. An urea removal system is being developedto complete this miniaturized articial kidney system. For this, articialcells containing multi-enzyme systems and articial cells containingurea removing microorganisms are being investigated. 10.10. Hemoperfusion in Liver Failure First observation of recovery of consciousness in hepatic coma As shown in acute poisoning patients in the above section, adsorbent articial cell hemoperfusion is effective in removing suicidal andaccidental overdoses of medications in patients. It is also effectivein removing other toxic substances from the circulating blood. Itseffectiveness in removing hepatic toxins from the circulating bloodwas rst shown in a grade IV hepatic coma patient, with recoveryof consciousness within an hour after the initiation of hemoperfusion(Chang, 1972b).April 2, 2007 Regenerative... ch10 in Poisoning, Kidney Failure, Liver Failure, and Immunology 289 A 50-year-old female was admitted with a history of alcohol abuse, onset of jaundice, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and dark urine.There wasno history of contact with hepatitis or of intravenous or intramuscularmedication. On admission, she had spider nevi and ascites. Thediagnosis was acute alcoholic hepatitis. Her condition deterioratedafter admission and she became comatose and unresponsive. Afterremaining comatose for two days, her condition was considered asterminal and with the insistence of her relatives she was referredby her physician to me for possible hemoperfusion since nothingelse could be done. One hour after hemoperfusion, she started toregain consciousness and began to recognize her relative and answerquestions in sentences. Hemoperfusion was carried out for a total of80 min. She remained conscious for about an hour after the end of thehemoperfusion, but lapsed into coma again. Three days later she wasstill comatose, and a second hemoperfusion was initiated. At the startof perfusion she was comatose; an hour later she looked at peoplewhen spoken to and there were increased voluntary movements andresponse to pain. She did not, however, recover full consciousness asin the rst hemoperfusion. Shortly after this, a liver biopsy specimenshowed cirrhosis, acute hepatitis, with small foci of regeneration. Thereafter, consciousness fluctuated between stupor and coma. A third hemoperfusion was carried out. Before this hemoperfusion, E.E.G.background activity was irregular and diffuse, with continuous thetaand delta activity and occasional high-amplitude single slow-waveand rare complex biphasic or triphasic congurations. At this time, thepatient was semi-comatose and did not respond to questions. An hourand a half after hemoperfusion the patient's consciousness improvedand she started to answer questions; she also complained of thirst andheaviness in the leg. E.E.G. recording after hemoperfusion showed aminimum improvement in the background activity. Biochemical evaluation of the treatment of hepatic coma was difcult, because the precise pathological mechanism was not known.On the other band, the three hemoperfusions each produced a clinicalresponse in consciousness. In one case, when the E.E.G. was recordedthere was a slight improvement in background activity. Since therewas no change in the blood-ammonia level after Cells Table 11. Hepatic Coma-related Chemicals Removed by Hemoperfusion Aromatic branched chain Protein bound moleculesOthers could not attribute the improvement in consciousness to the removal of blood-ammonia. However, whereas standard hemodialyzers at thattime were not efcient in removing large molecules from blood,hemoperfusion was very efcient in removing molecules up to 5000molecular weight (Chang, 1972e; Chang and Migchelsen, 1973;Chang and Lister, 1980; 1981) as well as protein bound molecules.Hemoperfusion is also effective in removing other chemicals relatedto hepatic coma (Table 11). Results around the world on effect of hemoperfusion on hepatic coma The above results led to further studies around the world in a large number of patients (Gazzard et al., 1978; 1980; al., 1982; William, 1983; O'Grady et support the nding that a signicant number of hepatic coma patient recovered consciousness. However,this did not translate into improved survival rates.Table 12 is a summaryof those reports that included the number of patients recovering fromconsciousness in addition to survival rates. However, these clinical results are not conclusive since the pathogenesis of hepatic coma and survival rate is complicated.In addition to hepatic toxins, other factors Regenerative... ch10 Hemoperfusion in Poisoning, Kidney Failure, Liver Failure, and Immunology 291 Table 12.

Furthermore, survival rates are related to age, etiology, grade of coma, and other complications, especially brain edema.In addition, hemoperfusion can only remove toxins from the bodybut the liver is a very complex organ with many other metabolicand synthetic functions. We should not expect hemoperfusion aloneto be a complete articial liver. Hemoperfusion will more likely bean important component of a more complex system (Chang, 1983a,1983e, 1986c, 1992b). Control studies in galactosamine-induced hepatic failure rats We, therefore, carried out detailed control studies in galactosamine- induced hepatic failure rats to allow for a more valid statistical analysis(Chang et al., 1978; Chang, 1971a, 1978b; al. , 1980; Tabata and Chang, 1980). With this model we can avoid variations in age, etiology and grades of coma. However,this model may not be the counterpart of fulminant hepatic failure inhuman. In addition, the survival rate in this model of grade III comais more like that of grade IV coma in human. This research includeddetailed studies in regard to the time of initiation of treatment; the needfor essential factors; comparison of hemoperfusion with exchangetransfusion, Cells Male Wistar rats weighing 275-309 gm and 47-67 days old were used. Forty-eight hours after galactosamine injection (1.1 gm/kg), the rats ingrade III coma were used in this study. Grade III coma rats were thosewhich \"sleep most of the time, but arousable.\" Of the 356 rats, 122reached grade III coma 48 h after injection with galactosamine. Toavoid variations between batches, all the animals in grade III comain each batch were randomly divided into equal numbers of test andcontrol animals. Similar studies were also carried out in rats in grade IIcoma. The results of all the studies (Chang et al., 1978; Mohsini et al., 1980; Tabata and Chang, 1980) are very briefly summarized in Tables13 and 14. In grade II coma rats, either one hemoperfusion or one liver perfusion resulted in signicant increase in survival time and survival rates ascompared to the control group (Table 1). However, cross circulationdid not have any signicant effects. In grade III coma rats, carrying out one hemoperfusion, liver perfusion or blood exchange transfusion alone did not result in anysignicant increase in survival time or survival rates. On the other hand,the combined use of one hemoperfusion and one blood exchangetransfusion resulted in signicant increase in survival time but notsurvival rate. Two hemoperfusions also resulted in signicant increasein survival time but not survival rates (Table 2). Another approach wascarried out with two hemoperfusions after one blood exchange, withthe second hemoperfusion carried out 4 h after the rst. When this Table 13.

Our research in fulminant hepatic rat models shows that hemoperfusion started in the earlier grades of coma can result insignicant increase in both survival time and survival rates (Changet al., 1978; Chirito et al., 1979). This has been supported by the result of another group that treated patients in grade III coma rather thanin grade IV coma as shown in Table 12 (Gimson et al. , 1978). The use of galactosamine rats for hemoperfusion has also been carried outby another group (Niu et al. , 1978). Their results corroborated our ndings. Our laboratory research also shows that hemoperfusion alone increases the survival time but not the survival rates in grade IIIhepatic coma rats. This may correspond to the transient recoveryof consciousness in grade IV hepatic coma patients. Fresh bloodApril 2, 2007 Regenerative... ch10 FA 294 Articial Cells exchange transfusion alone did not improve the survival time or survival rate of FHF grade III coma rats. Two ACAC hemoperfusioncombined with fresh blood exchange transfusion signicantlyimproved the survival time of FHF grade III coma rats, but notthe survival rates. An additional hemoperfusion after the rsthemoperfusion combined with blood exchange transfusion improvedboth the survival time and survival rates in grade III coma rats. This seems to suggest that hemoperfusion could be a part of a more complete liver support system. Thus, studies are ongoing inusing hemoperfusion to remove hepatic toxins to allow the liverto regenerate. One line of research is to combine this with theuse of hepatocytes perfusion system (Rozga et al. , 1993; Sussman et al. , 1994). Another approach is to combine this with articial cells containing hepatocytes or stem cells as discussed in the previouschapter. 10.11. Immunoadsorption Protein coated articial cells in immunoadsorption Albumin can bind tightly to the ultrathin collodion membrane of adsorbent articial cells (Chang, 1969a). This was initially used toincrease the blood compatibility of the adsorbent articial cellsfor hemoperfusion (Chang, 1969a). We also applied this albumincoating to synthetic immunosorbents resulting in blood compatiblesynthetic blood group immunosorbents (Chang, 1980d).This albumin-coated synthetic adsorbent has been applied clinically for removingblood group antibodies from plasma for bone marrow transplantation(Bensinger et al. , 1981). In addition, albumin-coated collodion activated charcoal (ACAC) was found to effectively remove antibodiesto albumin in animal studies (Terman et al. , 1977). This has become the basis of one line of research in which other types of antigensor antibodies are applied to the collodion coating of the activatedcharcoal to form immunosorbents. Other immonosorbents basedon this principle have also been developed for the treatment ofhuman systemic lupus erythrematosus, removal of antiHLA antibodiesin Regenerative... ch10 Hemoperfusion in Poisoning, Kidney Failure, Liver Failure, and Immunology 295 with monoclonal antibodies to low-density lipoproteins and (Terman, 1980; , 1991; Yang et al. , 2004) 10.12. Detailed Procedures for the Laboratory Preparation of ACAC Hemoperfusion Device The extracorporeal shunt chamber The laboratory version of the extracorporeal shunt chamber (Fig. 10.1) is prepared from high density polypropylene with internal dimensionsof 10-cm diameter and 8-cm height. A 10-cm diameter steel meshscreen with 100-micron openings placed on either side of the shuntchamber retains the microcapsules but allows the free flow of blood.Blood from patients enters the chamber at a right angle to the screenand is thus distributed evenly through the 10-cm diameter screenmesh before coming into direct contact with the microcapsules. The extracorporeal shunt chambers and the screens are re-usable, but careful washing and sterilization are required. Thus, after eachclinical hemoperfusion, the microcapsules are discarded from theshunt chambers, and the chambers and screens are washed clean. Boththe new and reused chambers and screens are completely submergedi na1v o l % sodium hypochlorite for 14 h. After this, the shunt chambers and screens are rinsed for 30 min with distilled water.They are allowedto dry, then coated with silicone spray (Manostat Co.) and stored in thesterilization room. On the day of the preparation of the microcapsulearticial kidney, the shunt chambers and screens are placed in a 1vol% sodium hypochlorite solution for 4 h and then rinsed for 30 minwith distilled water, and nally rinsed with sterile pyrogen-free waterand then used immediately. Preparation of activated charcoal Medical-grade spherical charcoal is available for the preparationof hemoperfusion devices. If this is not available, the laboratoryexperiment can also be carried out using crude activated charcoalgranules (Fisher Scientic Co., Coconut activated charcoal, 6 toApril 2, Articial Cells 14 mesh, #5-685). However, this would involve more preparations as follows. Sieves of 10 mesh (2 mm openings) and 20 mesh (0.85 mmopenings) are used to divide into three diameter ranges: 1) thoseretained by the 10-mesh sieve, 2) those retained by the 20-mesh sieve,and 3) those passing through the 20-mesh sieve to be discarded. Each400 g portion of sieved charcoal is placed in a 3-liter beaker andcovered with a 20-mesh sieve. Tap water is run through the sieve intothe container at a high speed for 2 h. This is sufcient to stir up thecharcoal particles to wash away soluble material or ne powder. Thewashed activated charcoal granules are then placed in a 1-liter beakerand autoclaved for 1 h at 121 C and 15 psi. In all the autoclaving, only autoclaves with internally generated steam (e.g. Castle-FisherScientic Co.) are used, and pyrogen-free sterile water is used togenerate the steam. After autoclaving, a second washing is carriedout for 2 h as before to remove any soluble material or ne powderwhich might result from the autoclaving. Each portion of the charcoalis then wrapped in clean cloth and secured with an autoclave tape.It is then autoclaved for 30 min at 121 C and 15 psi, then placed in a well-ventilated 50C oven for at least 48 h to dry completely. Each wrapped portion is then kept in the preparation room until ready foruse. The microencapsulation of the charcoal by coating with cellulosenitrate and albumin is carried out as described in the detailed andupdated version below. Preparation of articial cells containing activated charcoal A polymer solution is made up by dissolving 20 ml of collodion (USP 4 g cellulose nitrate in 100 ml of 1 alcohol:3 ether) in an organic solventconsisting of 30 ml of alcohol and 400 ml of ether. 450 ml of polymersolution is poured into a beaker containing 100 g of mesh-10 and300 g of mesh-20 activated charcoal granules previously prepared andsterilized as described above. The suspension is stirred manually witha metal stirring rod to ensure that all the granules are immersed inthe solution. The slightly wet polymer-coated activated charcoal isspread out in a 2 \u00d71 foot tray. This is then placed in a ventilated oven for 5 h at 50 C. After this, the polymer-coated activated charcoalApril 2, 2007 Regenerative... ch10 in Poisoning, Kidney Failure, Liver Failure, and Immunology 297 granules are placed in 2 liters of pyrogen-free distilled water. The suspension is carefully transferred into a 20-mesh sieve (20-cm indiameter and 5-cm in depth) and washed carefully with pyrogen-free water until all ne particles are removed. Care should be takennot to be too vigorous at this step to avoid breakage. The silicone-coated high density polypropylene chamber prepared as describedabove is lled with pyrogen-free distilled water, and the polymer-coated granules are added to ll the chamber. The chamber is closed,drained, stoppered, wrapped, sealed and placed in an autoclave for30 min at 121 C and 15 psi. At the end of this, the shunt is allowed to cool in its sealed, sterilized wrapping, if possible in a refrigerator.Using sterile techniques, the chamber is perfused with 4 liters ofcold pyrogen-free sterile saline (Baxter Laboratories, for human use)at about 200 ml/min by gravity. Albumin coating is carried out whenthe temperatures of the efferent washing from the chamber is less than10 C. A 1g/dl albumin solution in sterilized saline is prepared from human albumin (Cutter Co.). 200 ml of this albumin solution is usedto displace the same volume of saline from the chamber containingthe polymer-coated activated charcoal. The chamber is then sealed bysterile techniques and kept at 4 C for 15 h for the albumin to coat the polymer membrane. No autoclaving is carried out after albumincoating. After preparation, the microcapsule shunts are kept in sterilewrapping in the refrigerator at 4 C. In the present study, they can be used after being kept in the refrigerator for up to two months.Just before use, the albumin solution is displaced with 4 liters ofsaline (Baxter Laboratories, for human infusion) without allowing thealbumin-polymer-coated activated charcoal to come into contact withair at any time. Rabbit pyrogen testing is carried out using the displacedsaline. In the ve years of following the above procedure of washingand sterilization, there have been no positive rabbit pyrogen tests norhave there been any pyrogenic reactions in patients. Procedure for hemoperfusion Just before use in patients, the same general procedure of salinewashing of standard hemodialyzers is carried out. Thus, the shuntApril 2, 2007 Articial 298 Articial Cells chamber is perfused with about 3 liters of saline, the last liter containing 2000 U of heparin. The same amount of heparin that the patientnormally receives at the start of standard hemodialysis treatment isgiven. The remaining heparin is best given as a slow infusion of 2500to 3000 U/h into the afferent blood line in the shunt chamber. Tostart the hemoperfusion, the shunt chamber saline (about 200 ml) isdisplaced by the patient's blood before the outlet tubing is connectedto the patient. However, in the treatment of patients with severe drugintoxication or hepatic coma, where there is severe hypotension, itis advisable to prime the ACAC system with 7 g/IOOml albumin insaline, and to start the hemoperfusion without displacing the albuminsolution. The clotting time of blood is maintained at about 50 min. Two hours after the initiation of hemoperfusion, the procedure is terminated when another 700 U of heparin is injected into the shuntchamber and the blood in the chamber is returned to the patient by airdisplacement, followed by washing with 100 ml of saline containing100 U of heparin. In the present series of studies, 300 g of ACACmicrocapsules are used for 2 h in each hemoperfusion.April 5, 2007 9:15 SPI-B446 Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... ch11 FA CHAPTER 11 Perspectives on the Future of Articial Cells as Suggested by Past Research 11.1. Introduction In the last 50 years, there have been numerous extensions and developments of the idea of articial cells around the world. However,as shown by the examples in the last 10 chapters, we have barelytouched the surface of the full potential of this idea. Many otherextensions and variations in the membrane material, the congurationsand the contents are possible. The current international interest in thetransfer of technology for industrial development will help acceleratethese developments. To do this, there is a need for patents thatare based on novel ideas. A characteristic of such developmentsis that a new development or extension of \"articial cells\" tendsto be hidden under numerous new names. Some is a fragmentation of the eld of articialcells into different subdivisions, subdisciplines as well as scienticsocieties that do not interact with one another. Now is the time forresearchers from the different areas in this interdisciplinary eld tocome together to move the eld forward.This monograph is an attemptto bring some of these areas together. As the whole eld is now sobroad and extensive, that it is not possible to cover everything in onemonograph. This nal chapter can only touch on some of the otherextensions and future developments of the idea of articial cells that 299April 5, 2007 Regenerative... ch11 FA 300 Articial Cells have not been discussed in the previous chapters. There will be more books published on the subject under this book series. 11.2. Membrane Material At one time, biological cell membrane was thought to be a simple bilayer lipid membrane. However, extensive research by manyinvestigators is beginning to show that it is much more complicated.Indeed, there are indications that protein components play animportant structural and functional role (Fig. 11.1). Biological cellmembrane is complex and there is still much basic research to bedone. Articial cell membrane is much more simple minded. However,since it can be formed using different types of synthetic or biologicalmaterial, there are great potential for variations and extensions. Thefollowing are some examples (Fig. 11.1): 1) polymer and crosslinkedprotein 2) lipid membranes; 7) lipid membrane with transport carriers; and8) others. 11.3. Polymeric Membrane Porosity of polymeric membrane of articial cells The rst articial cells prepared have ultrathin membranes cellulose nitrate, polyamide, polystyrene or crosslinked protein (Chang,1957 to 1972). A silastic membrane is only permeable to gaseslike oxygen and carbon dioxide and lipophilic molecules. Thosewith cellulose nitrate or polyamide membranes are permeable tohydrophilic molecules. For instance, experimental analysis showsthat a polyamide membrane has an equivalent pore radius of18-19A (Chang, 1965,1972a) (Fig. 11.2). This means that polyamide membranes and cellulose nitrate membranes would exclude proteinmolecules but allow polypeptides and other to 5, Regenerative... ch11 FA Perspectives on the Future of Articial Cells as Suggested by Past Research 301 Fig. 11.1. Schematic representation of biological membrane ( top). Examples of articial membranes: polymer membrane;lipid cycliccarrier; with 01 2 = p Cp/Cd = d/ p Fig. 11.2. Equivalent pore radius of polyamide membrane articial cells obtained experimentally, as shown in above graph, is 18-19A . Polymeric membranes with unlimited variations in porosity and molecular weight cut off are available (Fig. 11.3). At the one, polymericmembranes like silastic or polyethylene membrane are not porous andonly allow gases and lipophilic molecules to pass through. On theother, macroporous polymeric membranes allow very large proteinmolecules to pass through. In between the two extremes, different typesof polymeric articial cell membranes can be prepared with differentporosity and molecular weight cut off. This would allow for variationsin porosity and permeability characteristics to suit different conditions.In addition, we can go beyond just porosity. For instance, one can evenfulll the requirements for those applications that require the removalof large lipophilic molecules but not the smaller hydrophilic moleculesor moisture. For instance, adsorbent articial cells are normally formedby the direct coating of porous ultrathin membranes onto activecharocoal microspheres to remove hydrophilic molecules (Chang,1969a). However, coating with a polyethylene membrane results inApril 5, 2007 9:15 SPI-B446 Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Regenerative... ch11 FA Perspectives on the Future of Articial Cells as Suggested by Past Research 303 Plasmaphresis membrane (>200,000 Da) Agarose ( > 150, 000 Da) Alginate-Po lylysine-Alg inate (6 0,000-70,000 Da) (60,000 Da) Dialysis membrane (30,000 Da) Cellulose nitrate or Polyamide Lipid complexed poly me r (100-200 vesicles or Silastic (lipophilic)Molecular exclusion of mem branes (Da) Molecular dim ensions (Da) Fig. 11.3.

The methods of preparing polymeric membrane articial cell include: solvent evaporation with emulsion or drop (Chang, 1957,1964); interfacial 304 Articial Cells 1964, 1965, 1972a); solvent evaporation with double emulsion 1965, 1972a, 1976a); (Discher et al. , 1999); and many other extensions and improvements (Calaore et al., 1999; DeVos et al., 2002; Duvivier-Kali et al., 1996; Orive et al., 2003; and many others). 11.4. Lipid Membrane Articial Cells Bangham et al. (1965) were the rst to prepare liposomes that are liquid crystal microspheres, each consisting of concentric shells ofbimolecular lipid layers (Fig. 11.3). This has been an useful membranemodel for membrane research and later for use in drug delivery. Mueller and Rudin (1968) reported that they can use a modication of the standard procedure (Chang, 1964) to prepare articial cellshaving only 60-100A thickness single bilayer lipid membrane (Fig. 11.4). These are of about 90 \u00b5in diameter and contain red blood cell hemolysate. The bilayer lipid membranes are not strong enoughto support these 90 \u00b5-diameter articial cells and they stay intact Fig. 11.4.

As described below, one solution is to tether the lipid membrane onto the ultrathin polymeric membrane of thearticial cell to form lipid-polymer membrane articial cells (Chang,1969d, 1972a). Other workers (Deamer 1976) used amodication of the \"ether evaporation method\" (Chang 1957, 1964) toform smaller single bilayer (unilamellar) lipid membrane articial cells. They call these lipid membrane articial cells, unilamellar liposomes or lipid vesicles. As will be discussed later, this forms the basis of the types of lipid vesicle being currently used in drug delivery systems(Torcillin, 2005). 11.5. Articial Cells with Lipid-Polymer Membrane and Incorporation of Macrocyclic Carrier,NA-K-ATPase and Other Carriers The exact molecular organization of biological cell membranes is not known. However, it is known that biological membranes are notcomposed of lipids alone and there is increasing evidence that theprotein components play an important structural and functional role.Korn (1968) even suggested that in the biosynthesis of biological cellmembranes the protein unit of the membrane is formed rst, followedby the addition of the lipid components. There are three types of lipid-polymer membrane articial cells rst reported (Fig. 11.5): 1) lipid-polymer membrane with ultrathinlipid component tethered to the polymeric membrane of articialcells (Chang, 1969d, 1972a); 2) addition of macrocyclic carrier(valinomycin) lipid-polymer articial cell membrane (Rosenthaland Chang, 1971, 1980); 3) addition of transport carrier, Na-K-ATPase,to the polymer articial cell membrane (Rosenthal and Chang, 1980). A number of ongoing studies by different groups will also be discussed below. Articial cells with lipid-polymer membrane As described in detail in Appendix II, we complex an equimolar lecithin-cholesterol mixture to the cells Cells Fig. Upper : lipid-polymer membrane articial cells (Chang, 1969d, 1972a); Middle : addition of macrocyclic carrier (valinomycin) to the lipid- polymer membrane of articial cells (Rosenthal and Chang, 1971, 1980),(this basic principle is now being used extensively in nanobiosensors); Lower : addition of transport carrier, Na-K-ATPase (Rosenthal and Chang 1980). or crosslinked protein) (Fig. 11.5) (Chang, 1969d, 1972a). For articial cells without lipid on the membrane, sodium influx isvery high across the porous polymeric membrane, 6 \u00d710 6mM/h- mm2(Fig. 11.6). Complexing the Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Regenerative... ch11 FA Perspectives on the Future of Articial Cells as Suggested by Past Research 307 Fig. 11.6. Equilibration of Na+across large polymeric membrane articial cells as compared to that large lipid-polymer membrane articial cells(Chang, 1969d, 1972a). equimolar lecithin-cholesterol mixture reduces the sodium influx to 4\u00d7106mM/h-mm2(Fig. 11.6). Surprisingly, this sodium flux across the lipid-polymer membrane articial cells is of the same order ofmagnitude as that observed by Stein for most natural membranes(Stein, 1967). On the other hand, a study by another group (Paganoand Thompson 1968) showed that across bilayer lipid membranes, thesodium influx is of orders of magnitude smaller than that of biologicalcell membranes. Thus, lipid-polymer membranes function more likebiological membranes as compared to lipid bilayers alone. Incorporation of channels into lipid-polymer membrane of articial cells However, lipid-polymer membrane articial cells by themselves do not show any selectivity between sodium and rubidium (Fig. 11.7a,11.7b). We incorporated valinomycin in the lipid-polymer membraneby exposing them to valinomycin at a concentration 6M.April 5, 308 Articial Cells Fig. 11.7a.

Mean and S.D. based on 4-12experiments. This results in selectivity so that the rubidium influx is enhanced but the sodium influx remains unchanged (Fig. 11.7a, 11.7b) (Rosenthaland Chang, 1971, 1980). Thus, the permeability Valinomycin at a increases this to 4.91 \u00b11.6\u00d7106cm/sec. However, valinomycin has no effect on the sodium influx and it remainsunchanged at 3.8 \u00b10.3\u00d710 6cm/sec. This simple study only shows the potential of the incorporation of channel forming material in the membrane of articial cells.However, this is just the beginning and much can be learned from theongoing research of molecular biologists. For instance, ion conductingchannels in cell membranes are complex protein structures, butApril 5, Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Regenerative... ch11 FA Perspectives on the Future of Articial Cells as Suggested by Past Research 309 Fig. 11.7b.

Mean and S.D. based on 4-12experiments. Bayley (1999) showed that only a bundle of -helices or nanotubular -strands is needed to carry out the function. They can retain their function even when most of the protein portion is removed from thecomplex protein structure. This means that researchers can designsynthetic channels or redesign natural channels by changing theamino acid sequence and helix orientation. One of the simplest formis a neutral peptide, Ac-(Leu-Ser-Ser-Leu-Leu-Ser-Leu) 3CONH 2, that can function a voltage-gated channel. Cyclic peptides can formhollow cylindrical nanotubules with possible variations in the lumenof the channel to allow for transport of different types of solutesbased on size (Hartgerink J. D. et al. , 1998). In the case of lipid membrane articial cells, lipid vesicles, exposure to -hemolysin Articial Cells genetically engineered mutants can increase the permeability to large single stranded nucleic acid (Bayley,1997). This is an example of howprogress in molecular biology can be applied to articial cells. Thelarge amount of work being carried out by molecular biologists canbe tapped for formation on different types of channels in articial cellmembranes. Incorporation of Na-K-ATPase in the membrane of articial cells The feasibility of incorporating Na-K-ATPase in the membrane of articial cells was studied (Rosenthal and Chang, 1980). The detailsof the method can be found in Appendix II. Briefly, large polyamidemembrane articial cells are rst formed. Then Na-K-ATPase isextracted the articial cells is 90-250 \u00d710 5\u00b5moles Pi/h/cm2(Table 11.1). This is 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than the ouabain-sensitive ATPase activity of human red blood cell membranesof 6\u00d710 5\u00b5moles Pi/h/cm2(obtained by Dunham and Glynn, 1961). Thus, it is possible to incorporate in articial cell membranes large amounts of Na-K-ATPase normally found associated with biologicalmembranes. Furthermore, the incorporated enzyme retains its enzymeactivity. However, this is only a feasibility study and much remainsto be done regarding the orientation, transport characteristics, andassociation with lipids and other membrane components. The need for ATP recycling in articial cell is now possible (Campbell and Chang, 1975) and this will be discussed in a later section in this chapter. Again, Table 11.1 Incorporation of Na-K-ATPase into Articial Cell Membranes Cell type Ouabain-sensitive ATPase activity per cm2of surface area Red blood Pi/h/cm2 Regenerative... ch11 FA Perspectives on the Future of Articial Cells as Suggested by Past Research 311 this area will benet greatly from the ongoing research and progress in the molecular biology of the structure and function of differenttransport mechanisms. A few examples are highlighted here. Melkikh and Seleznev (2005) used nonequilibrium statistical models of the active transport of ions in biomembranes. They used thisto study models of active transport of ions in biomembranes ofdifferent cells, including neurons, muscular cells, bacteria, plantsand mitochondria. They found the values of the membrane potentialand ion concentrations to be in qualitative agreement with theexperimental data. They discussed the requirements for models ofactive transport of ions in biomembranes (Melkikh and Seleznev 2006). The factors include resting potential, intracellular concentrations of ions, ATP-ADP chemical potentials, reversibility of the ionicpump, correlation between theoretical and experimental data, pumpefciency and effects of blocking the active transport. Barwe et al. (2007) looked at the Janus model of the NA-K-ATPase beta-subunit.Na-K-ATPase is an oligomer consisting of alpha and beta-subunits. The Na-K-ATPase beta-subunit (Na-K-beta) takes part in both the regulation of ion transport activity, and in cell-cell adhesion. Theseresults provide a structural basis for understanding how Na-K-betalinks ion transport and cell-cell adhesion. Pitard et al. (1996) studied ATP synthesis using the F 0F1ATP synthase from thermophilic Bacillus PS3 reconstituted into liposomes with bacteriorhodopsin. There isalso increasing interest in using the principle of the lipid-polymermembrane articial cells (Chang, 1969a, 1972; Rosenthal and Chang,1971, 1980) as a model of biological membrane for studying thestructure and function of membrane protein and receptors. Thus, Wagner andTamm (2000) developed a polymer supported lipid bilayer system to reconstitute integral membrane proteins in a laterally mobileform. When reconstituted in bilayers tethered on quartz, the proteinsare not mobile. However, on the lipid-polymer system, they found thatthe two proteins studied can become laterally mobile. They proposedthat the lipid-polymer model allows for the interaction of these proteinswith the underlying polymer.April 5, 2007 Articial Cells Nanobiosensors Nanobiosensor is an area that is of increasing interest and different approaches are being investigated (Scheller et al. , 2001). One of the many approaches is to use biosensors where the lipid bilayer is\"tethered\" on ultrathin polymeric support to form a lipid-polymercomplex. In this form, different \"channels\" can be inserted into themembrane to allow for selective movement of specic solute fordetection, somewhat similar to the principle reported earlier (Chang,1969d, 1972a; Rosenthal and Chang, 1971, 1980). Another approachthat is also possible is to encapsulate enzymes inside articial cells ofmicroscopic or nanodimension. This way, the product of enzymaticreaction can be followed by florescence or other methods. Theability to prepare articial cells with intracellular compartmentation(Chang, 1965, 1972a; Chang et al. , 1966) would allow multistep enzyme reactions to occur and be detected separately. Depending onthe type of reactions being followed, one can use either polymericmembrane articial cells, lipid membrane articial cells or lipid-polymer membrane articial cells. 11.6. Surface Properties of Articial Cell Membranes As discussed under the section on blood substitutes, the surface property of articial cell membranes is important in terms of theirbiocompatibility and retention in the circulation, as it is in termsof blood compatibility in hemoperfusion systems. Articial cellsfor delivery systems also need to have different types of surfaceproperties. Cellulose nitrate membrane articial cells (Chang, 1957,1964) contain negative charges due to the carboxyl groups in thepolymer. Polyamide nylon membrane articial cells (Chang et al. , 1963, 1966; Chang, 1964) contain both carboxyl and amino groups. With the proper selection of polymer materials, membranes with the desired xed charges can be obtained. For example, articialcell membranes with strong negative charge groups have beenprepared by using different amounts of sulfonated diamine such as4,4'-diamine-2,2'-diphenyldisulfonic when Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Regenerative... ch11 FA Perspectives on the Future of Articial Cells as Suggested by Past Research 313 SO3-other antigenantibodyPolysacharide (heparin) polyethylene glycol (PEG) artificial cell membranesurface chargeantigenVARIATIONS IN SURFACE PROPERTIES OF ARTIFICIAL CELLS albuminantibody to albuminOther antibody Fig. 11.8. Surface properties of articial cell membranes can be varied by 1) incorporation of negative or positive charge; 2) incorporation of albumin toincrease blood compatibility; 3) incorporation of antigens to bind antibodiesor antibodies to bind antigen; 4) incorporation of polysaccharide like heparinor polyethylene glycol (PEG) to increase compatibility or retention time incirculation. membrane articial cells (Chang, 1964, 1965, 1972a). The principle of incorporation of surface charges has also been used the preparationof lipid membrane articial cells, lipid vesicles, drug delivery systems(Gregoriadis, 1976; Torchilin, 2005). Albumin can to the ultrathin collodion membrane of adsorbent articial cells. This is initially used to increase theblood compatibility of the adsorbent articial cells for hemoperfusion(Chang, 1969a). This albumin coating has also been applied tosynthetic immunosorbents, resulting in blood compatible syntheticblood group immunosorbents (Chang, 1980d). In addition, Termanet al. (1977) showed in animal studies that albumin-coated collodion activated charcoal (ACAC) can remove antibodies to albumin. Thishas become a basis of one line of his research in which other typesof antigens or antibodies are applied to the collodion coating of thearticial cells to form immunosorbents. Other immunosorbents basedon this principle have also been developed for the treatment of humansystemic lupus erythematosus; removal Wingard et al. , 1991;Yang et al., 2004). Antibodies have also been incorporated in the surface of lipid liposomes to allow for drug targeting to cells bearingthe corresponding antigen (Torchilin, 2005). Mucopolysaccharides are important components of the surface of cell membranes. Incorporating a polyscharide, heparin to the articialcell membrane, increases the biocompatibility and circulation time ofarticial cells (Chang et al. , 1967, 1968). Incorporation of a synthetic polymer, polyethylene glycol (PEG) into the membrane of articialcells, nanocapsules and lipid vesicles, is even more effective forincreasing biocompatibility and circulation time (Chang et al. , 2003; LaVan et al. , 2002; Torchilin 2005). 11.7. Drug Delivery Articial cell-based drug delivery systems differ from the usual articial cells discussed up to now. Articial cells retain the bioreactive materialinside them to act on external molecules diffusing into the articialcells or to release their secretions. For instance, enzyme is retained inan articial cell to act on the substrate diffusing in while the productdiffuses out. Another example is articial cells containing islet thatrelease insulin. Unlike articial cells, a drug delivery system separatesthe drug from the external environment initially, but in order for thesystem to function, the contents need to be released as and when orwhere it is needed. General This monograph is not about drug delivery, an extremely large and broad area and which are covered in many excellent reviews andbooks; only the articial cells related area will be very brieflysummarized below. Submicron lipid membrane articial cells, i.e.lipid vesicles have been developed for sometime now, and arebest for use in the delivery of drugs and medications, includingchemotherapeutic agents. With the recent interest in biotechnologyand gene therapy, there is increasing need for delivery system thatcan carry sufcient amounts of macromolecules.

Standard articial cells compared to extension of articial cells for use in drug delivery. polymeric articial cells especially those of nano dimenions are of increasing importance. These nanodimension biodegradablepolymeric articial disguised under Polymeric microcapsules Luzzi (1970) used nylon membrane articial cells, microcapsules, prepared as reported earlier (Chang 1964) to microencapsulate drugsfor slow release in oral adminitration. Others have also extended thisapproach. However, the modern approaches in drug delivery systemsare based on injectable biodegradable systems. Biodegradable polymeric articial cells, nanoparticles, nanocapsules Biodegradable membrane articial cells have been prepared to contain enzymes, hormones, vaccines, and other biologicals (Chang, 1976a). The detailed method is described in Appendix II. The polylactide polymer can degrade in the body into lactic acid and nally into waterand carbon dioxide. Variations in preparation (see Appendix II) canresult in articial cells that releases insulin at different rates (Fig. 11.10)(Chang, 1976a). Biodegradable drug delivery systems are now widely used in different forms ranging from microscopic to nanodimensions. Theyare also known as nanoparticles, nanocapsules, polymersomes,nanotubules, etc. Langer' group has written an excellent review on thistopic (LaVan et al., 2002). Examples of other references include books and reviews (Malsch, 2003; and many others). As described earlier in this book, this method also forms the basis for preparing nanodimension articial red blood cells (Chang, 2005,2006). Liposomes evolved into lipid vesicles that are lipid membrane articial cells Bangham rst reported the preparation of liposomes each consisting of microspheres of hundreds of concentric lipid bilayers \u2014 multi-lamellar(Fig. 11.4) (Bangham et al. , 1965).

His subsequentresearch in England resulted in the rst report on the use of liposomesas drug delivery systems that has opened a whole new approach (see1976 book edited by Gregoriadis). The large amount of lipid in theoriginal multi-lamellar liposome limits the amount of water solubledrugs that can be enclosed. Thus, the basic principle and method ofpreparing articial cells using ether as the dispersing phase (Chang1957, 1964) was extended by researchers into what they called an\"ether evaporation method\" to Articial Cells lipid membrane articial cells, i.e. lipid vesicles, have since been extensively studied for use as drug delivery systems (Torchilin, 2005). Polymer(PEG)-lipid membrane articial cells or PEG-lipid vesicles The original liposome drug carrier consists of a lipid with a water soluble drug entrapped in the aqueous phase, and a water-insolubledrug in the lipid phase. It is good to see that researchers have applieda number of the results of our earlier basic research on surfacecharge, lipid-polymer membrane, surface modication, and magnetictargeting into the original lipid vesicles for drug delivery. These andother important developments being carried out by many researchersin the eld of drug delivery have resulted in important progress in theeld. Thus, surface charges are incorporated in liposome for possibletargeting of drug and more recently the use of positively charged lipidto complex with DNA. Then a biodegradable polymer, polyethyleneglycol (PEG), is incorporated in the liposome surface to result in longercirculation time. Further developments led to the incorporation ofantibodies in the lipid membrane to allow for targeting to cells withthe corresponding antigens. Magnetic particles loading into liposomeallows for magnetic targeting. Thus, lipid vesicles are getting to bemore like the lipid-polymer membrane articial cells (Chang, 1969d,1972a) and no longer pure lipid vesicles. One major advantage of lipidvesicles is its ability to fuse with cellular membranes or membranes ofintracellular organelles. This allows for much versatility in their abilityto deliver drugs to different sites of the cells (Fig. 11.11). As a result of all these developments, and in particular the preparation of polymer(PEG)-lipid membrane articial cells, there hasbeen much recent progress. A number of drugs in PEG-lipid vesicleshas already been approved for clinical use or use in clinical trials.

This signicantly increases the circulation time and strengthas compared to PEG-lipid membrane articial cells (Discher et al. , 1999; Photos et al. , 2003).

Articial Cells Containing Multienzyme Systems with Recycling of ATP and NADH Most metabolic functions are carried out in cells by complex multienzyme systems. Thus, articial cells containing multienzymesystems would have more uses as compared to those containingsingle enzymes. However, multienzymes require energy from ATPor NAD(P)H and biological cells have the ability to regeneratethese for continuous use by the cells. Can we make articial cellscontaining useful multienzyme systems that can also regenerate ATPand NAD(P)H? Articial cells containing multienzyme system for recycling of ATP One of the most important cofactor that is recycled in biological cells is ATP. We therefore started by studying articial cells containinghexokinase and pyruvate kinase for the recycling of ATP (Fig. 11.12)(Campbell and Chang, 1975). Our study showed that this system caneffectively recycle ATP as analyzed by the continuous conversionof glucose into glucose-6-phosphate and phosphoenol pyruvate intopyruvate. multienzyme system recycling Articial cells containing yeast alcohol dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase (Campbell and Chang, 1975, 1976) (Fig.11.12). NAD+ and NADH can equilibrate rapidly across the membrane to be recycledin the articial cells. Recycling of NAD +and NADH follows as shown by the production of malate (Fig. 11.13).

Absence of glucose blocks the recyle. Lower : Polymer membrane articial cells containing yeast alcohol dehydrogenase and malatedehydrogenase can recycle NADH as shown by the continuous production ofmalate (Campbell and Chang, 1975,1976). In the absence of recycle, malateproduction ceases. Articial cells containing urease, glutamate dehydrogenase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase Since the needed NADH can be recycled, the next study was to see whether we could use a multienzyme system for the removal ofurea. First, we used a model system of polymer membrane articialcells loaded with converts mM/L UREA AMMONIA20 10 5 0 urease, glutamate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase for the multistepenzyme reaction of conversion of urea into amino acid glutamic acid and forthe recyling of NADPH. Urea is lowered without any increase in ammonialevel, as ammonia is converted into glutamate (Cousineau and Chang, 1977;Chang and Malouf, 1979; 1979b). ammonia glutamic acid. Glucose-6-P dehydrogenase serves to recycle of NADPH. The rate of conversion of urea into glutamate and the recycling of NADPH could be followed by the rate of formation of6-phosphogluconate, decrease in urea level, or the formation ofglutamic acid. Ammonium acetate could be used in this reactioninstead of urea. Figure 11.13 shows that the area level is loweredwithout any increase in ammonia level, as ammonia is efcientlyconverted into glutamate. Glutamate is formed at the same rateirrespective of whether urea or ammonium acetate is used as thesubstrate. This suggests that the rate-limiting step in this sequentialreaction is in the conversion of ammonia into glutamic acid. Dextran-NADH retained and recyled inside articial cells (Fig. 11.4) The above studies show that articial cells containing multienzyme systems can carry out sequential enzymatic reactions to convert ureainto glutamate and at the same time recycle the required NADH. Theabove study is a model experiment to test this feasibility. However, inpotential medical or engineering uses, one would prefer to have thecofactor retained and recycled inside the articial cells. This way, itApril 5, 2007 Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Regenerative... ch11 FA Perspectives on the Future of Articial Cells as Suggested by Past Research 323 will not be necessary to have NADH supplied from outside. The rst step is to see how we can retain the NADH inside the articial cellswithout decreasing the permeability to other substrates and products. We use Mosbach's method (Larsson and Mosbach, 1971) to covalently link NADH to a macromolecule to form a soluble NADH-dextran. We found that the resulting NADH-dextran can be retained inside the articial cells where it is recycled (Fig. 11.14) (Campbell and Chang, 1978; Grunwald and Chang, 1978,1979,1981). The articial cells are retained in a flow reactor perfused by the substrates. The recycling activity is followed by the production ofmalate (Table 11.2). The recycling activity of the shunt is high as65% of the oxaloacetic acid is converted into malic acid in onepassage through is retainedinside the cells where it is recycled (Campbell and Chang, 1978;Grunwald and Chang, 1978,1979,1981). The soluble NADH-dextran isformed using Mosbach's method (Larsson and Mosbach, 1971). Table 11.2shows the rates of regeneration of NAD +. Table 11.2 Recycling of Dextran-NAD+in Multienzyme Polymer Membrane Articial Cells Storage NAD+Regenrated Articial Cells microcapsules is regenerated two times each minute during the reaction. The shunt showed good stability, with the reaction rateremaining constant for the rst hour and 83% of the original activitybeing retained even after 3 h of continuous reaction. The same shuntcould be stored and reused several times. It is important to use puriedhemoglobin instead of crude hemoglobin for coencapsulation. Crudehemoglobin contains impurities that interfere with the recycling. Multienzyme with NAD-dextran for conversion of waste, urea, into useful essential amino acids We rst showed that articial cells containing multienzyme systems and NAD+-dextran can convert urea or ammonia into glutamate (Gu and Chang, 1988b, 1988c). The next step was to see if we could use amore complex multienzyme system and NAD +-dextran to convert the waste, urea, into useful products, essential L-branched-chain aminoacids, L-leucine, L-valine and L- isoleucine. This is based on articialcells containing urease to convert urea into ammonia and leucinedehyrogenase to convert the ammonia formed into essential aminoacids. Glucose dehydrogenase is also included for the recycling ofNAD +-dextran using glucose as source of energy for cofactor recycling (Gu and Chang, 1988a). Other enzymes for recycling of NAD+- dextran include yeast alcohol dehydrogenase that uses alcohol assource of energy (Gu and Chang, 1990a); malate dehydrogenasethat uses malate as a source of energy (Gu and Chang, 1990b) andL-lactic dehydrogenase that uses L-lactic acid as a source of energy(Gu and Chang, 1991). The results obtained dehyrogenase, below (Fig. 11.15) to illustrate this approach.

Thus, use our lipid-polymermembrane articial cell (Chang, 1969d, 1972a) that is only permeableto ammonia and urea but not to larger molecules like NADH.Biological cell membranes have transport mechanism to transportglucose that cannot diffuse across the cell membranes. Since we do notyet have a glucose transport carrier in the lipid-polymer member, wehave to replace glucose dehydrogenase with alcohol dehydrogenase. This way, external ethanol can enter the articial cells and serve as a source of energy for the recycling of NADH (Fig. 11.16) (Yu and Chang,1981a, 1981b,1982a, 1982b; Ilan & Chang, 1986). The standard lipid-polymer complexed articial cell membrane is not permeable to urea (Table 11.3). By decreasing the proportionof cholesterol in the lecithin-cholesterol component, the membranebecomes permeable to urea (Table11.3) but with no leakage of NAD + free NADH retained within the lipid- polymer membrane articial cells for the conversion of urea and ammonia into glutamate. The lipid-polymer membrane articial cells contain threeenzymes, urease, glutamate dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase. Table 11.3 shows the effects of permeability to urea and rate of conversion of urea into glutamic acid (Yu and Chang, 1981a, Blood Regenerative... ch11 FA Perspectives on the Future of Articial Cells as Suggested by Past Research 327 Table 11.3 Multienzyme Lipid-Polymer Membrane Articial Cells Convert Urea intoGlutamate Permeability to Glutamic Acid ( \u00b5\u00b5mol/L/3h) Low 0 Medium 2.42High 6.93 Summary The above basic research shows that it is possible to prepare articial cells containing multistep enzyme systems with recycling of ATP andNAD(P)H. Further developments may lead to a number of possibleapplications. One example is to complete the urea removal componentof the miniaturized hemoperfusion-ultraltration system for treatingkidney failure. We have already applied this basic information in thepreparation of nano articial red blood cells that contain multienzymesystem with cofactor recycling to convert methemoglobin back tohemoglobin (Chang, 2005i, 2006a). Potentially, any combinations ofenzyme systems can be enclosed within each articial cell. The lipid-polyamide membrane articial cell can also be used in basic researchas a cell model. 11.9. Articial Cells Containing Microsomes, Cytosol Ribosomes and Polymerases Introduction Chapter 5 shows that it is possible to prepare complete articial red blood cells containing hemoglobin and all the complex enzymesystems of its biological counterpart. In addition, safety and efcacyin animal studies have also been shown. The next step is to preparearticial cells that have the properties of more complex biologicalcells.April 5, 2007 9:15 SPI-B446 Articial Cells Articial cells containing liver microsomes and cytosol We isolated microsomes and cytosol from rat liver and encapsulated these into cellulose nitrate membrane articial cells (Yuan andChang, 1986). The method is based on the standard method(Chang, 1964, 1972a), with the updated method (Chang, 2005a)available in Appendix II. NADPH-cytochrome C reductase and lactatedehydrogenate are used as the marker enzymes for, respectively,microsmes and cytosol. Table 11.4 shows that after encapsulationinto NADPH-cytochrome C reductase, marker activity. enzyme for cytosol, retained 11% of its originalactivity after microencapulation into articial cells. It is important tocarry out the preparation at 4 C instead of 23C. The result shows that articial cells can be used to encapsulate subcellular organelles. Liver cells contain lysomes which whenreleased can destroy the subcellular organelles. By preparing thehomogenate of the liver cells and rapidly removing the lysosomefraction, we can reconstitute the other organelles and cytosol intoan articial cell free from the possible proteolytic effects of thelysosmomes. Table 11.4 Articial Cells Containing Liver Microsomes and Cytochrome C as Marker for Microsomes LactateDehydrogenase as Marker for Cytosol Original Activity Activity Recovered Activity Recovered (units) containing polymerases, ribosomes and transcription/translation system An even more exciting and ambitious effort is the recent serious attempts to develop a \"living\" articial cell. A Blood Regenerative... ch11 FA Perspectives on the Future of Articial Cells as Suggested by Past Research 329 dened by Deamer (2005) as an articial cell that can capture energy, maintain ion gradients and contain macromolecules. Macromoleculesmust be able to grow by polymerization and evolve in a way thatspeeds up growth. They must be able to store information and possessthe ability to mutate and direct the growth of catalytic polymers. Theymust also be able to reproduce themselves and divide. Studies onarticial cells described earlier in this monograph suggest that many ofthese criteria can be met. However, preparing articial cells that canreproduce themselves and divide will be extremely difcult. Some ofthe exciting studies on \"living\" articial cells are highlighted in thenext paragraph. Szostak, at Harvard, have been carrying out a number of studies (Hanczyc et al. , 2003; Chen et al. , 2004; Josephson et al. , 2005). For example, they have prepared a simplied model articial cellby putting simple RNA enzymes inside the cells, and showing thatthe cells can conduct their characteristic activities. They are alsocarrying out the modication of the cellular translational system toallow for the ribosomal translation of molecules for medical uses.Monnard and Deamer (2001) prepared models for primitive cellularlife by encapsulating T7 RNA polymerases and templates into lipidmembrane articial cells. This enzyme was able to synthesize anRNA transcript from the DNA template that required four nucleosidetriphosphates. Since the lipid membrane was not permeable tonucleoside triphosphates, they had to use DMPC liposomes at atemperature of 23 C. Despite this, permeation was still very slow, thus limiting the rate of RNA synthesis. Other researchers encapsulated acomplex polymerase system into lipid membrane articial cells andshowed that the PCR reaction could be carried out (Oberholzer et al., 1995). Since the substrate could not diffuse across the lipid membrane,it had to be loaded together with the whole system. The result was thatthere was only enough substrate to produce a very small amount of theproduct. They have also encapsulated ribosomes into lipid membranearticial cells and obtained some translation product. Noireaux andLibchaber (2004) from Rockefeller University were able to engineera DNA plasmid to express proteins and encapsulate this into lipidmembrane articial cells. However, they could only produce proteinsApril 5, SPI-B446 Articial Regenerative... ch11 FA 330 Articial Cells for a few hours because the source material inside the articial cells could not be replaced. They solved this problem by incorporating achannel-forming protein, alpha hemolysin, into the lipid articial cellsmembrane.This way, the articial membrane could become permeableto larger molecules like nucleotides. As a result, they could function forup to four days. The use of selectively permeable crosslinked proteinmembrane or polymeric membrane articial cells as described inSection 11.3 above (Chang, 1964, 1972a, 2005i) can result in an evenmore efcient supply of external substrates. In another study, Grifths and Tawk (2000) used compartment- alization to load the transcription/translation system into a water-in-oil emulsion. This way, each gene could occupy a separate wateremulsion to carry out its function. A more efcient approach may bepossible by using the polymeric compartmental system of articialcell where each articial cell 1966, 2005i) (Fig. 2.4). This way, biologically active systems could be enclosed separately or in combination into each of thesearticial subcellular compartments. Since the permeability of each ofthe compartments could be individually and separately adjusted, thismight allow for more efcient stepwise functions. The most difcult steps will be attempts to prepare articial cells that can reproduce themselves and divide.To do this, the articial cellshave to contain genes and enzymes that can be replicated and sharedamong daughter cells. One possible way is to use a self-replicatingribozyme that can duplicate itself and act as both genetic materialand the catalyst for replication. Johnston et al. (2001) used a ribozyme to catalyze the replication of another RNA template molecule. Theirnext step is to verify that the RNA can continue with the process ofreplication. Rasmussen et al. (2003) of Los Alamos National Laboratory used computer simulation to design a micelle with information codingand metabolic machinery on its exterior. They used DNA-mimicsconjugated to a light-sensitive molecule. In theory, light would triggerthe conversion of substrates into peptide nucleic acid (PNA) based onthe PNA template. These are incorporated into the micelle that wouldgrow and divide. The next step is to test this theoretical simulationApril 5, 2007 9:15 SPI-B446 Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Regenerative... ch11 FA Perspectives on the Future of Articial Cells as Suggested by Past Research 331 experimentally. Ishikawa et al. (2004) of the University of Osaka, Japan used a lipid membrane articial cell containing a bacterial plasmid andSP6 RNA polymerase, which acted as a driving force for the productionof a T7 RNA polymerase needed to catalyze the transcription of agene. Thus, this membrane-bound system shows both gene expressionand a two-stage genetic cascade of events. Information regardingthe minimal number of genes needed for a \"living\" articial cell isimportant. Kobayashi et al. (2003) identied the minimum set of genes inBacillus subtilis , narrowing the number to 271 and only 4% of these have unknown functions. It would help if this number can be narroweddown even further to allow for the preparation of a primitive \"living\"articial cell. All these exciting and ambitious efforts show that many of the criteria for a \"living\" articial cell can possibly be met. The most difcultcriterion is the ability of the \"living\" articial cell to reproduce itselfand divide. Instead of using lipid membrane articial cells alone,a combination with crosslinked-protein membrane or polymericmembrane articial cells could be used \u2014 either individually or incombination. 11.10. New Generations of Computer System and Nanoscale Robotics Based on Articial Cells Researchers in this eld suggest that next generation self-repairing computer and robotics technology requires the use of intelligenttechnical systems based on articial cells. Toward this end,the European Commission is supporting an integrated programof \"PROGRAMMABLE ARTIFICIAL CELL EVOLUTION\" (PACE)(http:/ /wills.gex.gmd.de/bmcmyp/Data/PACE/Public/). This is aimedat new generation of embedded information technology usingprogrammable, self-assembling articial cells. To achieve this, thePACE project focusses on the intelligent technical (IT) potential ofarticial cells that are truly \"articial\" and not replicates of biologicalcells. This project consists of a consortium of 13 partners and twocooperating groups from eight European countries and the USA. Thegroup includes expertise in complex systems, embedded systems,April 5, 2007 SPI-B446 Cells robotics, evolution, statistics, chemical kinetics, physical simulation, microfluidics, organic and bioorganic chemistry, computer interfacesand control systems. With this interdisciplinary approach, they plan toprepare microscopic articial cells as chemical information processingsystems. They suggest that for the next-generation robotics andnanoscale technologies to be realized, they would need distributedprocessing systems with self-organizing properties in the form ofarticial cells. These will be designed and assembled automaticallyfrom non-living materials. They have developed a computer-programmable closed-loop controller, based on microfluidic technology. This can be used toobserve and control the local physical environment of cell-sizedchemical subsystems. They have also shown that an articial peptidenucleic acid (PNA) can synthesize or direct the information in thesynthesis of another copy of itsel f \u2014 a step towards self-replication. They have also developed simulation models to describe articial cells on an intermediate physical level to follow the control, stability andbreakdown of the subsystems.They are also studying the use of articialcells as a novel platform for self-assembling microscopic robots, bothin simulation and experiments. On an ethical level, they emphasizethat \"What we are talking about is not chemically making a copy of anexisting articial cell, but chemically synthesizing something whichwe could call articial cell.\" 11.11. The Future of Articial Cells Nature's creations are complex, intricate and ingenious. For ages,humans have tried to reproduce exact replicates of some of thesewithout success. Success only comes to those who are humble enoughto use the principles learned from nature to produce much simplersystems instead of trying to replicate nature. A good example is in the many unsuccessful and often fatal attempts made by humans to fly like birds. The rst initial success is when theChinese, instead of trying to fly like birds, use the principle to buildvery simple kites that later can even carry humans. These evolve intogliders. Since then, each major progress in flight is related to majorApril 5, 2007 9:15 SPI-B446 Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Regenerative... ch11 FA Perspectives on the Future of Articial Cells as Suggested by Past Research 333 progresses in other areas. Thus, the invention of the motor engine in Europe allows the gliders to evolve into the rst propeller drivenplanes rst in the US and then Europe. Centuries ago, the Chineseinvented reworks and rocket-propelled weapons. This principle hasbeen applied to jet engine that allows the propeller planes to evolveinto the rst jet-planes in Germany.These have now reached enormoussize and speed. Further developments allows human to travel to spacerst in Russia and then the USA. This is an example of how progressis made on both an interdisciplinary and international basis. Muchdelay can be the result if there is not enough interaction between thedifferent disciplines and countries. For many years, scientists have carried out tremendous amounts of research on the structural and functional basis of biological cells.However, attempts to reproduce exact replicas of biological cells havenot been successful. On the other hand, the purpose of the veryrst humble \"articial cells\" (Chang, 1957) was not to reproducebiological cells, but to use available basic knowledge to prepare verysimple systems for possible uses in medicine and other areas. Eachmajor progress in other areas has led to stepwise progress in articialcells. First, there was the coming of age of polymer chemistry andbiomaterials. Then there was the recognition of the importance anddevelopments in biotechnology. There is the present ongoing progressin molecular biology and genomics that will contribute to a quantumleap in the area of articial cells, including the recent efforts on \"living\"articial cells. One can expect that there will be important futureprogress in other areas that will contribute to unlimited progress inthe area of articial cells. One example is in the use of articial cellsfor next generation computer and nanoscale robotics. The following prediction in my 1972 monograph on \"Articial Cells\" is already out of date: \"Articial Cell is not a specic physical entity. It is an idea involving the preparation of articial structuresof cellular dimensions for possible replacement or supplement ofdecient cell functions. It is clear that different approaches can be usedto demonstrate this idea \". In the last 50 years (Chang, 1957), articial cells have progressed way beyond this 1972 prediction. Articialcells can now be of macro, micro, nano and molecular dimensions.April 5, 2007 Regenerative... ch11 FA 334 Articial Cells There are also unlimited possibilities in variations for the articial cell membranes and contents. Searching for \"articial cells\" on theInternet (for example, www.google.com) gives more than 50,000 hitsin all areas of articial cells. Even then, we have only just touchedthe surface of the enormous potential of articial cells. One hopesthat the many arbitrary subdivisions of \"articial cells\" under the guiseof different names can be brought together! When this takes place,the result of the pooling of talents, specialized know-how in this veryinterdisciplinary and international area will lead to progress beyondanyone's imagination.April 6, 2007 17:17 SPI-B446Articial Appendix1 1st APPENDIX I 1957 Report on \"Method for Preparing Articial Hemoglobin Corpuscles\" 1957 Research Report for Physiology 43b for partial fulllment of honors B.Sc. in Physiology McGill University Thomas M. S. Chang (Figures scanned from original report with new fonts added for clarity \u2014 text reformatted but with no change from original, excepterrors in spelling, grammar and typing.) The red corpuscle, once it has passed the reticulocyte stage, is almost without metabolic activity and is little more than ahemoglobin containing shell 1. This pointed towards the possibility that perhaps an articially produced hemoglobin corpuscle maybe used as a physiologically functioning red blood cell. With thispossibility in mind, rst, a survey of the literature concerningerythrocytes, hemoglobin and possible articial membranes wasmade; then possible methods of getting hemoglobin into corpuscles ofmicroscopic sizes were tried. ERYTHROCYTES 1. Structure The normal human erythrocyte is a biconcave disc, with an average diameter in dried lms of 7.2 \u00b5. The thickness of cell is l \u00b5at the centre and 2.4 \u00b5near the edge. Although the cell membrane is not elastic, the cell can become distorted in order to pass through narrow capillaries, 335April 6, 2007 17:17 SPI-B446Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Appendix1 1st Reading 336 Articial Cells also, the concave faces of the corpuscle can be distended to a convex shape when the cell content increases as in the case of hypotonicenvironment. The membrane is of lipoprotein, and when examinedwith electromicroscope appears to be nely granular without folds. The mean corpuscular volume of the cell has an average of 86 cubic \u00b5. 2. Function Hemoglobin of the erythrocyte carries out the functions of trans- portation of O 2to the tissues and that of transportation of CO2from the tissues to the lung to be excreted. This respiratory function ofthe hemoglobin of the erythrocyte is the most important function.Hemoglobin and electrolytes inside cell also act as a bufferingsystem to maintain the normal pH of 7.3-7.4. 60% of bufferingaction of whole blood is due to red cell, the other 40% to plasma.Carbonic anhydrase is highly concentrated in erythrocytes. This isimportant since the reaction CO 2+H 2O=H 2CO3is speeded up 2500 times, resulting in the transportation of CO2to the lung to be excreted. 3. Enzymes and inclusion bodies Besides carbonic anhydrase, metabolic enzymes, dehydrogenases andpyridine nucleotides; there are various other enzymes whose functionsare at the presence obscure. Also there are inclusion bodies incirculating erythrocytes: Punctate basophilia, Cabot rings, Howell-Jolly Quite a number of these areassociated with diseases, especially the Howell-Jolly bodies which areassociated with severe anemia of both the iron deciency and thepernicious type, and with leukemia, and are particularly common aftersplenectomy. This is mentioned, because in an articially producedhemoglobin corpuscle it is possible to include in the cell content allsorts of combinations of enzyme systems and inclusion bodies. Thisway, the function and activity of the various enzymes and inclusionbodies in the erythrocyte may be studied.April 6, Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... Appendix1 1st 1957 Report on \"Method for Preparing Articial Hemoglobin Corpuscles\" 337 HEMOGLOBIN 1. Molecular structure Hemoglobin is the red coloring matter of the red blood cell. It is a conjugated protein, consisting of a protein part called globin andan iron-pyrrol compound known as hematin or heme 5. Work by Svodberg, Adair and others indicates that hemoglobin has a molecularweight of 66,800 and that the molecule of hemoglobin contains fourmolecules of hematin. The hemoglobin molecule is 64 A in length, 48A in width and 36 A in thickness. 2. Hemoglobin content of the blood Hemoglobin is held within the stroma of the erythrocyte. The normal hemoglobin content of the blood is usually measured colorimetricallydepending upon the oxygen combining capacity or the blood. Thepresent assessment of normality is between 15 and l6 gm per l00 mlfor males and with a lower value for females. Knowing the hemoglobincontent of the blood the mean corpuscular hemoglobin (M.C.H.) andthe mean corpuscular hemoglobin formulae: M.C.H. =(Hb in gms/1000 ml blood)/Red cells in millions per mm 3. This is expressed in \u00b5u and the normal value for male being 29 \u00b5u (with a range or 27 to 32 \u00b5u) M.C.H.C. =(Hb in gms per 100ml blood \u00d7100)/(VOL in ml packed cells per l00ml blood) This normal value is about 33% with a range of 32-38% and shows no variation with sex. 3. Methemoglobin The ferrous iron in hemoglobin is readily oxidized by oxidizing agents to the ferric state, which is methemoglobin. Methemoglobin is brownin solution and has an absorption band with a maximum at 634 mu.In normal human blood it is approximately 2% of the total Hb. Now,since methemoglobin does not have the power to combine with O 2,i t is important in the preparation of hemoglobin corpuscles to preserveApril 6, 2007 17:17 SPI-B446Articial Cells: Substitutes, Regenerative... Appendix1 1st Reading 338 Articial Cells the hemoglobin in the ferrous state. There are various enzyme systems in the red blood cell for the purpose of reduction of methemoglobin tohemoglobin. These nucleotides. Other ways of reducing methemoglobin to hemoglobin are by the action of sodiumsulphide, amyl nitrite in phosphate-saline solution, Na 2S204, ascorbic acid, or alkaline solution prepared from TiCl 3. All these will readily convert methemoglobin to hemoglobin which does combine with O 2 and CO 2. 4. Derivatives of hemoglobin In the handling of hemoglobin during the preparation of the articialhemoglobin corpuscles, it is important to be able to tell whetherthe hemoglobin inside the membrane is still hemoglobin, or if not,it is helpful to be able to know what substance it is changed into. The derivatives of hemoglobin may be OHb, methemoglobin, CO- hemoglobin, nitric oxide hemoglobin, hemochromogen, hematin,alkali-hematin, and hematoporphyrin. Each of these possesses aspecic absorption spectrum which serves as an aid in theirdetection 2. MEMBRANE 1. Reason for using collodion membrane After much searching around, collodion is chosen for the membrane, since it has been studied quite extensively by a number ofphysiologists. 6,7,9, l0,11,12It is also being widely used by bacteriologists as membranes for ultraltration8. It is used despite the fact that being a plastic material, it cannot be used as the membrane of cells to beperfused into the circulation since once injected, it will remain as suchin the circulation. However, since the problem of nding a suitablemembrane would already be a project in itself and since the amountof time available for this project is limited, collodion was used asthe membrane. Of course, a lipoprotein membrane would be mostsuitable.April 6, 2007 17:17 SPI-B446Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... Appendix1 1st 1957 Report on \"Method for Preparing Articial Hemoglobin Corpuscles\" 339 2. Studies made on collodion membrane Much can be made used of the information obtained by the physiologists and bacteriologists concerning the permeability ofcollodion to various molecules and methods of preparing collodionmembrane with any desired pore size. In 1907, Bechhold discoveredthat membranes of collodion could be precipitated by waterfrom non-aqeous solution. His rst paper (Bechhold H. Z. Physik Chem60,257,1907; 64,328,1908) is still among the best on this subject,here he sets forth many principles and applications. Elford 8classied colloidal membranes into two main types: 1. Microgel: It is an acetic collodion membrane which has relatively course structure with pores of microscopic order. 2. Ultragel: Which is ether alcohol collodion membranes. The structure or this type or membrane is not resolved by microscopicapparatus. Ultaviolet light microphotography show that it is builtup of particulate matter. He also found that dilution of the ether alcohol Collodion with ether gives a thinner and less permeable membrane, whereas thickness andpermeability increases with addition of amyl alcohol. Bauer 6found that the addition or 1 ml of glacial acetic acid to 200 ml of dilutedcollodion solution would reduce average pore size to 200 m \u00b5.T h e addition of 2 ml reduce the pore size to l00 m \u00b5, and the addition of 3 ml reduces pore size further to 15 m \u00b5. Field made collodion membranes which held back potassium chloride and sucrose. Kistler 9found that collodion membrane can be made as dense as desired by lteringthrough them solution of cellulose or of collodion. 3. Final constituents of collodion solution used in this experiment The collodion solution purchased is the commercially prepared Collodion U.S.P. XI. It is a solution of 4 gms of pyroxylin (chieflytetranitropcellulose) in 100 ml of a mixture of 1 vol alcohol and 3 volether. Its specic gravity is 0.765-0.775. When exposed in thin layers itApril 6, 2007 17:17 SPI-B446Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... Appendix1 1st Reading 340 Articial Cells evaporates and leaves a tough somewhat opaque and permeable lm. During the experiment it was found that the hemoglobin in solutionwas precipitated by the addition of this collodion solution. To decidethe substance causing this precipitation, hemoglobin solution wasadded to each of pure ether, alcohol and it was found that whereasHb is precipitated by alcohol, it is not precipitated when added toether. The collodion solution was then evaporated to dryness, and thenredissolved in ether, when hemoglobin is added to this ether collodionsolution, hemoglobin remains in solution without precipitating. Thusit is concluded that it is the alcohol that precipitated the hemoglobin,and from here on, only ether collodion solution was used. METHOD The basic problem is how to make a hemoglobin corpuscle of about 7\u00b5diameter with a thin and permeable collodion membrane. Various methods were tried. Method I The arrangement for this method is as shown in the diagram (Fig.1). A jet of air is sent into the funnel leading to a very narrow nozzle. Hemoglobin crystals, which are nely ground to microscopic sizes, areput in at X, so that the powder is sent through a stream of collodion. Itwas hoped that, each crystal in passing through the stream of Collodionwould be coated with a coating of collodion which on drying wouldform a membrane. Three problems arise immediately in attempting this method. First, using this method, the amount of Hb crystals required is quiteenormous, and attempts to crystallize a large amount of hemoglobinfrom the solution was not too successful. Secondly, a stream of collodion exposed to the air would be evaporated very rapidly, and in order to maintain such a streamapproximately 1000 ml/3 mins is required, and the amount available isonly sufcient for very small scale experimentation. However, the mostsevere problem is that for the hemoglobin crystals to be sent throughApril 6, 2007 17:17 SPI-B446Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... Appendix1 1st Report on \"Method for Preparing Articial Hemoglobin Corpuscles\" 341 Fig. 1. Arrangement of Apparatus. Fig. 2. the stream of collodion, it would be necessary for the jet of air to be blown through the collodion at the same time. It was found that if theforce of the air jet was not strong enough, then it would not be ableto pass through the stream of collodion solution. However, when theforce is increased, nothing can penetrate the collodion stream until ahole is made by the jet of air in the collodion stream, and the crystalswould then be sent through by the jet of air without coming into contactwith the stream of collodion. A sort of an all-or-none effect.April 6, Cells: Regenerative... Appendix1 1st Reading 342 Articial Cells Fig. 3. The solution to this problem is to send the crystals through the stream of collodion by means other than air pressure. One possible way is toeject the crystals through the use of a very powerful spring, and onewas made as shown. This way, the crystals are not carried by a jet of air, and it is hoped that therefore each crystal might be able to pass through the streamof collodion individually due to their force of momentum. However,further experiments shows that this method will turn out to be ratherelaborate, since in order for the ne crystals to attain the necessaryspeed to penetrate the collodion stream, they will have to be ejectedin a vacuum to avoid the resistance of air to such small particles.However, instead of increasing the speed of the crystals, it would bejust as good to decrease the viscosity of the collodion stream. Thusanother method was attempted. Fig. 4.April 6, SPI-B446Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... Appendix1 1st 1957 Report on \"Method for Preparing Articial Hemoglobin Corpuscles\" 343 Method II Instead of using a stream of collodion, a spray of collodion is used. Here the viscosity of the collodion is extremely small. But here, there is a serious problem, since it takes a considerable amount of time for the collodion membrane to be perfectly set. When hemoglobin covered by a membrane of collodion which has not set touches water, the hemoglobin would just simply dissolve in water. Another problem is that, the droplets are so close together that once they are coated with collodion they would stick together. Experimentation with collodion Knowing that one of the important problem is the 'setting' of thecollodion as a membrane, a study was made of the way in which acollodion membrane is set. Two useful observations were made. Firstit was observed that a thin collodion layer sets slowly (10 to 15mins)after it comes in contact with water. Secondly, a lm of collodion isattached to the surface of water when it comes in contact with it. Withthese facts in mind, it was felt that it might be more feasible to approachthe problem from a different angle. Method III Collodion was placed on top of a liquid which is immiscible with waterand which has a specic gravity greater than collodion but less thansaline. (In this case parafn oil was used.) A small drop of hemoglobinsolution was dropped about 1/2 feet from the surface of the collodionsolution. This height is to give the hemoglobin droplet the neccessaryforce to penetrate the collodion solution. As the hemoglobin dropletpasses through the collodion solution a lm of collodion is attachedto its surface. Due to the force of gravity, this droplet falls into theparafn oil through the collodion layer. The purpose of the parafn oilis to allow the collodion membrane time to set on the droplet of thehemoglobin solution since if this droplet was to enter water right awaythe membrane would rupture since it is still immaturely set. About 30minutes was allowed for the droplet to remain in the parafn oil. AtApril 6, SPI-B446Articial Cells: Substitutes, Regenerative... Appendix1 1st Reading 344 Articial Cells Fig. 5. the end of this time the membrane was perfectly set, and the collodion layer together with as much as possible of the parafn oil was removed. The remaining parafn oil, together the hemoglobin corpuscle was then emulsied in saline, the parafn oil having been emulsied andfloat to the surface leaving behind the hemoglobin corpuscle in saline. With this method, it was successful in preparing hemoglobin corpuscles with size of about 0.2 mm in diameter.The trouble with thismethod being that the surface tension between collodion and parafnoil was such that only hemoglobin droplets of appreciable size wouldbe able to penetrate the collodion-parafn oil interface. Method IV \u2014 successful method With the above principle, methods for obtaining hemoglobin corpuscles of microscopic sizes were then attempted. Introduction: A possibility that comes into mind was the method of emulsion. Books on colloidal chemistry were read. For a while themethod of emulsion appeared to be rather impractical in this case,since in the emulsions used by the chemists, it is only possible toApril 6, 2007 17:17 SPI-B446Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... Appendix1 1st 1957 Report on \"Method for Preparing Articial Hemoglobin Corpuscles\" 345 emulsify one liquid in another and the emulsion would only remain in the liquid in which it is emulsied. While on the verge of discardingthe method for emulsion, the principle found in using collodion layerand parafn layer comes into mind. Many attempts were then madeto combine this principle with the principle of emulsion. After many fruitless and unsuccessful attempts, a method was found. This method is based entirely on the principle of the previous method. Procedure 1. Place one part of concentrated hemoglobin solution in 10 parts of ether. Shaking this gives a dispersion of hemoglobin in ether, butthis dispersion is unstable, since as soon as shaking is stopped etherand hemoglobin separate into two layers almost immediately 2. Collodion solution (ether-collodion) is put in drop by drop while shaking continuously. Collodion on entering the solutionand coming into contact with the aqueous hemoglobin solutiondispersed in ether, would form a layer of collodion around thehemoglobin droplets.( As shown by the observations obtained inmethod III). When enough collodion is adhered to the surface ofthe hemoglobin droplets, the dispersion becomes stable, i.e. thedispersion remain as such after shaking is discontinued, since nowaround each droplet is a thin layer of collodion acting as a sort ofemulsier.When about 1 part of collodion to 10 parts of solution hasbeen added it was found that a collodion membrane with sufcientstrength would be formed. 3. The problem now is to remove the hemoglobin droplets with the collodion membrane from the ether. Here, two problems wereencountered. Collodion is soluble in ether, thus there is collodionin the ether containing the hemoglobin droplets. Now, collodionsets when comes in contact with water, thus water cannot be usedto separate the droplets of hemoglobin from the ether since on theaddition of water, the whole solution would \"coagulate\". Anotherproblem is that since collodion is soluble in ether, the collodionmembrane of the hemoglobin droplets would be incompletely setApril 6, 17:17 SPI-B446Articial Cells: Appendix1 6.April SPI-B446Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... Appendix1 1st 1957 Report on \"Method for Preparing Articial Hemoglobin Corpuscles\" 347 i.e. the part that is in contact with the hemoglobin solution is set, but the part in contact with ether is not set. To solve this problem,the ether containing the hemoglobin droplets with their membrane,is placed on top of n-butyl-benzoate which has been recommendedas a good emulsier. This is put in for centrifuging, so that themicroscopic hemoglobin droplets could pass through the interfaceinto the n-butyl-benzoate.(After centrifuge, the corpuscles are in the n-butyl-benzoate. Sincethe collodion outside being in contact with ether previous tocentrifuging is not completely set and thus is still adhesive. As aresult, they tend to stick together. Here is where n-butyl-benzoatecomes into use. Being a good emulsifying liquid, on shaking this,the corpuscles would be dispersed in the n-butyl-benzoate. Quitea bit of shaking is required to disperse the corpuscles whichhave adhered together. This dispersion allows the corpuscles to beseparated from one another and thus when the collodion membranesets, they would not be stuck together. After leaving it in thiscondition for 15 mins the membrane would be set completely.) 5. The dispersion of corpuscles in n-butyl-benzoate is placed over saline and centrifuge. The hemoglobin corpuscles would then becentrifuged into the saline. Now, some n-butyl-benzoate wouldbe stuck to the corpuscles resulting in the corpuscles havingthe appearance of being in an aggregation in the saline. Here,another advantage is made use of n-butyl-benzoate, since onshaking the corpuscles inside the saline, the n-butyl-benzoatewhich may have adhered to the surface of the corpuscle wouldbe emulsied in saline leaving behind the corpuscles with theircollodion membrane. Proof that collodion membrane is formed To ensure that the membrane of the corpuscle is collodion and not n-butyl-benzoatel the following experiment was done: 1. Disperse hemoglobin in n-butyl-benzoate 2. Centrifuge over saline as before.April 6, Cells: Substitutes, Regenerative... Appendix1 1st Reading 348 Articial Cells 3. Hemoglobin inside n-butyl-benzoate would be centrifuged into the saline, but when this is shaken as before, the n-butyl-benzoate isemulsied and hemoglobin is left behind and dissolves in saline.From this experiment it is concluded that the membrane in theprevious method was not n-butyl-benzoate. Since, collodion is theonly other alternative, it may be concluded that a membrane ofcollodion has been formed around each hemoglobin droplet. RESULTS i. Size of corpuscles Microscopic studies show that the size of the corpuscles approximatesthat of the red blood cells. However, there are some which are eithertoo big or too small. It is suggested that a solution with an uniform sizeof corpuscles could be obtained as follows: Using the ultraltrationmembrane of the bacteriologists, rst the solution could be lteredthrough lter which allows all particles smaller than 8 \u00b5to pass through \u2014 this gets rid of the large corpuscles. Following this thesolution is ltered through lter which allows anything smaller than5\u00b5to pass through. Thus what is left behind in the lter would be corpuscles with diameters of between 5 \u00b5and 9 \u00b5. ii. Content of corpuscles Microscopic studies show that the corpuscles contain a colored material. Spectrometric studies show that these pigments areoxyhemoglobin. (This is observed after the alcohol-ether solvent ofthe collodion solution is replaced by ether.) iii. Oxygen content It was found that using the principle of oximetry, a dissociation curvewas obtained. However, it must be mentioned that this particularexperiment is extremely unreliable, since it is found that during theexperiment there has been a considerable amount of hemolysis of thecorpuscles due to too much shaking.April 6, SPI-B446Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... Appendix1 1st 1957 Report on \"Method for Preparing Articial Hemoglobin Corpuscles\" 349 Fig. 7. Arrangement of Apparatus for Oxygen Dissociation Curve. Method: The solution was placed in container(C) the atmospheric pressure in the container was adjusted by the syringe, and, at lowpressures, by vacuum pump, to the desired pressure which is read fromthe manometer(M).The container was shook intermittently to allow forequilibrium to set up. After 20 minutes, the solution was read in thecolorimeter with a wave length of 650 mu. The dissociation curve obtained is then plotted as shown. Actual amount of oxygen contained: Using a syringe with its needle inside a stop cork, a vacuum can be made in the syringe and the gasthat evaporate from the solution can be measured. In one experimentthe amount of gas obtained for that of a fully oxygenated solutionof 0.6 ml is 0.l ml, and that for a fully reduced one is about 0.02 mlApril 6, 2007 17:17 SPI-B446Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... Appendix1 1st Reading 350 Articial Cells Fig. 8. (very approximate.) It is realized that using such a small amount of solution, the results obtained is extremely unreliable. However, thesolution of n-butyl-benzoate ordered has not as yet arrived and notsufcient amount was left to prepare anything more than 0.6 ml. Sinceit is quite inaccurate and impossible to do a dissociation curve withthe possible range of gas of less than 0.08 ml, this was forced to beomitted. (N.B. Many other possible experiments on this preparation could and should be done, but with the sudden realization that more than120 hours have been unknowingly spent on this project at the expenseof other work, and with the approaching of the nal, it was necessaryto put and end to this project \u2014 not without reluctance!! ) DISCUSSIONS How far does this preparation fulll the function of the red blood cells? Those prepared in this experiment are so crude that nothing can be said of them. However, further perfection may lead to the fulllmentof most of the main functions of the red blood cells, as discussed inthe following sections.April 6, 2007 17:17 SPI-B446Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Substitutes, Regenerative... Appendix1 1st 1957 Report on \"Method for Preparing Articial Hemoglobin Corpuscles\" 351 Transportation of O 2and CO 2 The kinetics of the formation of oxyhemoglobin from hemoglobin in the red blood cells is different from that in solution. With a pO 2of 75 mm Hg and at 10-20C, and with the same concentration, the half time for oxyhemoglobin saturation of the corpuscles is 0.05 seconds(i.e. for the erythrocytes), whereas that for hemoglobin solution the halftime is 0.004 second. This difference in speed could be due to one ormore of the following factors 5 1. Presence of gradients of dissolved gas in the fluid surrounding the corpuscles thus leading to retardation owing to the limiting effectof diffusion. 2. Delay due to time of diffusion through membrane.3. Dissolved gas that enter rst combine with hemoglobin on the periphery of the erythrocyte and succeeding dissolving gas havingto penetrate a nite distance into the corpuscle before combiningwith hemoglobin. Thus in preparing articial hemoglobin corpuscles, these factors have to be considered. Now, in the circulation the cells are well stirredand thus there is no appreciable concentration gradient of dissolvedgas in the fluid surrounding the corpuscles, thus factor one can bedisregarded. As far as factor 2 is concerned, that of delay due to timeof diffusion through membrane, the articial membrane used must besuch that it allows easy passage of dissolved O 2and CO 2. Also it should not be thicker than necessary, since according to Fick's equation: rate of diffusion =D(C 1C2)/dx Where x is the thickness of the cell membrane. The studies of Weech and Michaelis10, shows an interesting factor of permeability of collodion. He found that urea passes through the collodionmembrane many times more rapidly than glycerine and about 250times faster than for glucose. Also, he found that collodion is freelypermeable to water molecules. From these observations it wouldappear that there shouldn't be too much trouble for O 2or CO 2to pass through the membrane. However, it would be interesting toApril 6, 2007 17:17 SPI-B446Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Articial Cells nd out the permeability of the collodion membrane to dissolved O2and CO 2, and to prepare a membrane (by method described under the section \"Membrane\") which affords the best permeabilityto O 2and CO 2without allowing hemoglobin molecules to leak through. As far as factor three, that of dissolved gas which enter rst combine with hemoglobin on the periphery of corpuscle, and succeedingdissolved gas that enter having to penetrate a nite distance intothe corpuscles before combination with hemoglobin occurs. Thesolution is to have the greatest surface area for a given volumeof hemoglobin solution, and to have a shape which is such thatit gives the smallest depth. Of course, the biconcave disc shapeof the erythrocytes is the best solution to this problem, since withthis shape all the requirements mentioned are fullled. Would it bepossible to make a biconcave hemoglobin corpuscle articially? Ithas been observed under the microscope that some of the articialcorpuscles have a sort of biconcave shape-others have surface asshown: This may have resulted from the fact that the collodion when set, tends to shrink slightly \u2014 Since the setting of membrane does nottake place simultaneously in the surface of any single corpuscle. Thepart that still has not set is still very elastic, thus when one part of themembrane is set the volume of the corpuscle is decreased slightly, anda pressure is exerted on the enclosed solution. This pressure in turnis transmitted from the solution onto the part of the membrane whichhas not yet set, thus causing them to bulge out slightly. Thus it is amatter of pure chance for the biconcave, triconcave or tetraconcaveand 'polyconcave' shape of the corpuscles. These shapes may in away compensate for the lack of the actual biconcave disk shape of theerythrocytes.April 6, 2007 17:17 SPI-B446Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... Appendix1 1st 1957 Report on \"Method for Preparing Articial Hemoglobin Corpuscles\" 353 Enzyme systems in the erythrocyte As tar as the various enzyme systems present in the erythrocyte are concerned, it wouldn't be too much of a problem since it is possibleto include any enzyme system in the hemoglobin solution whenpreparing the corpuscles. One of the most important enzyme in theerythrocyte is carbonic anhydrase in the way of transportation of CO 2, this can easily be included in the hemoglobin solution. Buffering action of erythrocyte Hemoglobin and potassium ions in the erythrocyte play an importantpart in the buffering of the pH of the body. Now, in the preparedcorpuscles only hemoglobin is present for this action, and potassiumion is absent. (This may be simply a speculation, however, from thewide variety of potassium concentration in different species of animaland from the fact that hemoglobin may be present as a potassiumsalt \u2014 it is suspected that perhaps part of the potassium ions arekept inside the cells despite the higher concentration because oftheir loose ionic association with hemoglobin; the other part beingkept in by the metabolic activity of the membrane. Even beforethis project was started, this question has always been present. Thusit would be interesting to see whether there is any concentrationgradient of potassium ions in the case of an articial membrane.If there is a gradient in concentration in the case of an inactivecollodion membrane, then it may point towards the possibility ofthe potassium ions being present in an ionic association with thehemoglobin.) From what has been said before, it would appear that further perfection may make it possible for the articially produced corpusclesto meet the requirement of the erythrocytes as far as the physiologicalfunction is concerned. However, to perfect this for perfusing is quiteanother question. Predominant of the numerous problems wouldbe the problem of nding a suitable membran e \u2014 a lipoprotein membrane. Although it is not a hopeless case, a tremendous amountof work has to be put in before anything could be perfected.April 6, 2007 17:17 SPI-B446Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... Appendix1 1st Reading 354 Articial Cells SUMMARY I. Four methods for preparing articial hemoglobin corpuscles were attempted. II. One of the four methods was practical and appeared to be usable. III. From this method, corpuscles approximating the size of erythrocytes were produced.The content of these corpuscles insidethe collodion membrane was found to be oxyhemoglobin underspectrometric studies. IV. An oxygen dissociation curve was obtained and the oxygen content of these preparations was found. But it is felt that the resultsobtained in IV is not reliable, since only one set of result wasdone on these, since there was not enough time for repeating thesemeasurements. BIBLIOGRAPHY 1. Fulton J.F.: 'Textbook of R. Weech A.A.:Journey X 12. Michaelis and W.A.: Journey Gen. Regenerative... Appendix FA APPENDIX II Methods not Described in Detail in the 11 Chapters The available methods of preparation of articial cells are based on the original principle of emulsion for small dimension cells and thedrop method for larger dimension cells. Appendix I is a reprint ofthis rst report (Chang, 1957). There are now numerous extensions,improvements and developments of this principle and books can bewritten on these. Thus, Appendix II can only describe a few simplerlaboratory examples. Once these are mastered, other methods can beeasily reproduced from the literature. A. EMULSION METHODS FOR ARTIFICIAL CELLS A.1. Cellulose nitrate membrane articial cells of micro dimensions Cellulose nitrate membrane articial cells are prepared using an updated procedure based on earlier publications (Chang 1957, 1964,1965, 1972a, 2005a). A.1.1. Materials 1. Hemoglobin solution containing enzymes: 15 g of hemoglobin (Bovine Hemoglobin Type 1, 2x crystallized, dialyzed andlyophilized) (Sigma; St. Louis, MO) is dissolved in 100 ml of distilledwater and ltered through Whatman No. Appendix FA 356 Articial Cells 2. Water saturated ether: Shake analytical grade ether with distilled water in a separating funnel, and then leave the mixture standingfor the two phases to separate so that the water can be discarded. 3. Fisher magnetic stirrer.4. Cellulose nitrate solution: Spread 100 ml of USP Collodion (USP) in an evaporating dish in a well ventilated hood overnight. This allowsthe complete evaporation of its organic solvents leaving behind adry thin sheet. Cut the thin sheet of polymer into small pieces anddissolve them in a 100 ml mixture containing 82.5 ml analyticalgrad ether and 17.5 ml analytical grade absolute alcohol ( seeNote ). 5. Tween 20 solution.The 50% (v/v) concentration solution is prepared by mixing equal volumes of Tween 20 (Atlas Powder; Montreal,Canada) and distilled water, and then adjusting the pH to 7.For 1% (v/v) concentration solution, mix 1% of Tween 20 tothe buffer solution used as the suspending media for the nalmicroencapsulated enzyme system. A.1.2. Procedure for microscopic dimension articial cells 1. Enzymes and other materials to be microencapsulated are dissolved or suspended in 2.5 ml of the hemoglobin solution. Thenal pH is adjusted to 8.5 with Tris HCl, pH 8.5, and hemoglobinconcentration adjusted to 100 g/l. 2. 2.5 ml of this solution are added to a 150 ml glass beaker, and 25 ml of water saturated ether is added. 3. The mixture is immediately stirred with a Fisher magnetic stirrer at 1200 rpm (setting of 5) for 5 sec. 4. While stirring is continued, 25 ml of a cellulose nitrate solution is added. Stirring is continued for another 60 sec. 5. The beaker is covered and allowed to stand unstirred at 4 C for 45 min. 6. The supernatant is decanted and 30 ml of n-butyl benzoate added. The mixture is stirred for 30 sec at the same magnetic stirrer setting. 7. The beaker is allowed to stand uncovered and unstirred at 4C for 30 min. Then the butyl benzoate is removed completely aftercentrifugation at 350 g for 5 min.April 8, 2007 9:23 SPI-B446Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... Appendix FA Methods not Described in Detail in the 11 Chapters 357 8. 25 ml of the 50% (v/v) Tween solution are added. Stirring is started at a setting of 10 for 30 sec. 9. 25 ml of water is added and stirring is continued at a setting of 5 for 30 sec, then 200 ml of water is added. 10. The supernatant is removed and the articial cells are washed 3 more times with 200 ml of the 1%Tween 20.The articial cells arethen suspended in a suitable buffer, e.g. phosphate buffer (pH 7.5).In properly prepared articial cells, there should not be leakageof hemoglobin after the preparation ( see A.1.3. Comments ). A.1.3. Comments 1. Hemoglobin at a concentration of 100 g/l is necessary for the successful preparation of cellulose nitrate membrane articialcells. Furthermore, this high concentration of protein stabilizesthe enzymes during the preparation and also during reaction andstorage (Chang, 1971b). When the material (e.g. NADH) to beencapsulated is sensitive to the enzymes present in hemoglobins,highly puried hemoglobins are used. Purication using afnitychromatography on an NAD +sepharose column will be required. 2. The long-term stability of microencapsulated enzyme activity can be greatly increased by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde (Chang,1971b). This is done at the expense of reduced initial enzymeactivity. 3. When using cellulose nitrate articial cells containing enzymes for oral administration, the permeability of the membrane may need tobe decreased so as to prevent the entry of smaller tryptic enzymes.Permeability can be decreased by decreasing the proportion ofalcohol used in dissolving the evaporated cellulose nitrate polymer. A.2. Polyamide membrane articial cells of micro dimensions Polyamide membrane articial cells are prepared using an updated procedure based on earlier publications (Chang, 1964, 1965, 1972a,2005a).April 8, 2007 9:23 SPI-B446Articial 1. organic solution: 0.5% (v/v) Span 85 (Atlas Powder; cyclohexane (1:4). 2. Add 100 mg of terephthaloyl chloride (ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA, U.S.A.) to a30 ml organic solution (chloroform:cyclohexane, 1:4) kept in an icebath. Cover and stir with a magnetic stirrer for 4 h, and then lterwith Whatman no. 7 paper (Whatman). Prepare just before A.2.3.Comments ). 3 and 0.464 g 1.6-hexadiamine (J. T. Baker Chemical) in 5 ml distilledwater that contains the material to be encapsulated. Adjust pH to9. Add 2 ml 50% polyethyleneimine (ICN K +K Inc.) to the diamine solution, readjust pH to 9, and make up the nal volume to 10 mlwith distilled water. Prepare just before use (see A.2.3. Comments) . 4. Hemoglobin solution 10 g/100 ml: Prepare as described above (A.2.1) for cellulose nitrate articial cells, but the material to beencapsulated is dissolved in 5 ml of hemoglobin solution instead ofdistilled water. The nal pH is adjusted to 9. A.2.2. Procedure for preparing microscopic polyamide membrane articial cells Polyamide membrane articial cells of 100 \u00b5M mean diameter are prepared using an updated method based on the earlier methods(Chang, 1964, 1965, 1972a; Chang, et al. , 1966). 1. Enzyme is added to 2.5 ml of the hemoglobin solution with pH and concentrations adjusted as in A.1.1. 2. 2.5 ml of the diamine-polyethyleneimine solution are added to the above solution and mixed for 10 sec in a 150 ml beaker placed inan ice bath. 3. 25 ml of Span 85 organic solution, prepared as described in Section A.2.1, are added and stirred in the Fisher magnetic stirrer at a speed setting of 2.5 for 60 sec. 4. 25 ml of terephthaloyl organic solution are added and the reaction is allowed to proceed for 3 min with the same stirring speed.April 8, 2007 9:23 SPI-B446Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... Appendix FA Methods not Described in Detail in the 11 Chapters 359 5. The supernatant is discarded and another 25 ml of the terephthaloyl organic solution are added. 6. The reaction is carried out with stirring for another 3 min. The supernatant is discarded. 7. Then, 50 ml of the Span 85 organic solution are added and stirred for 30 sec. The supernatant is discarded. After this, the same procedure for the use of Tween 20 as described for cellulose nitrate articial cells (A.1.1) is used for the transfer of thearticial cells into the buffer solution. A.2.3. Comments 1. Failure in preparing good articial cells is frequently due to the use of diamine or diacids that have been stored after they havebeen opened. A new unopened bottle will usually solve theproblems. Unlike the cellulose nitrate articial cells, in interfacialpolymerization the hemoglobin solution can be replaced by a 10%polyetheleneimine solution adjusted to pH 9. However, the articialcells prepared without hemoglobin may not be as sturdy. Cross-linking the microencapsulated enzymes with glutaraldehyde afterthe preparation of the enzyme articial cells could also be carriedout to increase the long-term stability of the enclosed enzymes(Chang, 1971b), although this will decrease the initial enzymeactivity. 2. In multienzyme reactions requiring co-factor recycling, the cofactor can be crosslinked to dextran-70 and then encapsulated togetherwith the enzymes. For acetamide] is coupled to dextran T-70, polyethyleneimine ordextran to form a water soluble NAD +derivative and then encapsulated together with the multienzyme systems in the articialcells. This way both the cellulose nitrate articial cells andpolyamide articial cells can be used, and a high permeation tosubstrates and products is made possible. However, linking cofactorto soluble macromolecules will result in signicant increases insteric hindrance and diffusion restrictions of the cofactor.April 8, 2007 9:23 SPI-B446Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Cells A.3. Lipid-polymer membrane articial cells of micro dimensions that retain ATP and NAD(P)H As described under B.2, large lipid-polyamide membrane articial cells have been prepared (Chang 1969d, 1972a). Lipid-polyamidearticial cells of 100 \u00b5m mean diameter containing multienzyme systems, cofactors and alpha-ketoglutarate can also be prepared (YT Yu and Chang 1981) as a modication of A.2. above for microscopic polyamide articial cells. A.3.1. Materials 1. See A.2.1. above. 2. Glutamic dehydrogenase, bovine liver, type III, 40 U per mg (Sigma). 3. Alcohol dehydrogenase, yeast, 330 U per mg (Sigma).4. Urease, 51 U per mg (Millipore).5. Lipid-organic liquid: 1.4 g lecithin and 0.86 g cholesterol are added to 100 ml tetradecane and stirred for 4 h at room temperature. If amore permeable lipid membrane is required to allow urea to diffuseacross, then the lipid compositions should be 0.43 g cholesterol and0.7 g lecithin. A.3.2. Procedure The rst part is similar to the procedure described in A.2.2. for polyamide articial cells. 1. To 2 ml of the hemoglobin solution is added 12.5 mg glutamic dehydrogenase, 6.25 mg alcohol dehydrogenase, 0.5 mg urease,1.18 mg ADP, and either NAD +(0.52 mg, 105 mg, 2.11 mg or 21.13 mg) or NADH (21.13 mg) dissolved in 0.25 ml of water.Finally, 56.5 mg alpha-ketoglutarate, 2.5 mg MgCl 2, and 0.93 mg KCl are added to the 0.25 ml solution. 2. 2.5 ml of the hemoglobin-enzyme solution so prepared is added to 2.5 ml of the diamine-polyethyleneime solution. The remainingsteps are the same as described above (A.2.2) except that theTween20 steps are omitted here. Instead, after washing with the Span 85April 8, 2007 9:23 SPI-B446Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... Appendix FA Methods not Described in Detail in the 11 Chapters 361 organic solution, the following steps are carried out to apply the lipids to the polyamide membranes. 3. The articial cells are rinsed twice with 10 ml of the lipid-organic liquid. 4. Then, another 10 ml of the lipid-organic liquid are added and the suspension is slowly rotated fo r1ha t4C on a multi-purpose rotator. 5. After this, the supernatant is decanted and the lipid-polyamide membrane articial cells are recovered and left in this form at 4C without being suspended in an aqueous solution until it is addedto the substrate solution just before the reaction. The procedure takes practice and the articial cells prepared must be tested for the absence of leakage of enzymes or cofactors before beingused in experimental studies. A.3.3. Comments Lipid-polyamide membrane articial cells containing multienzyme systems, cofactors and substrates can retain cofactors in the free form. Thus, analogous to the intracellular environments of red blood cells, free NADH or NADPH in solution inside the articial cells is effectivelyrecycled by the multistep enzyme systems which are also in solution.However, only lipophilic or very small hydrophilic molecules like ureacan cross the membrane. A.4. Double emulsion methods This is based on the use of polymers that are soluble in organic solvents resulting in a solution that is not soluble in the aqueousphase. An aqueous solution containing a solution or suspension of thematerial to be encapsulated is added to a larger volume of this polymersolution. The aqueous phase is emulsied in the polymer solution. After this the polymer solution containing the aqueous emulsion is placed into a larger volume of aqueous phase containing an oil inwater emulsier to form a double emulsion. Each microdroplet ofpolymer solution contains a smaller Regenerative... Appendix FA 362 Articial Cells As the organic solvent is evaporated (polystyrene, polylactidie) or as polymerization takes place (e.g. silastic), the polymer solidiedresulting in microspheres each containing an emulsion of the aqueousmaterial. Instead of material dissolved or suspended in the originalaqueous solution, crystals or power of the material can also beadded directly to the polymer solution. This way, the resulting nalmicrospheres will each contain crystals or powder. The originalmethods reported for polystyrene (Chang, 1965, 1972a), silastic(Chang, 1966), and biodegradable polymer (e.g. polylactide, Chang,1976a) have been greatly extended and improved upon especially bythose in the eld of drug delivery. This is now a very extensive area,but is not directly related to the discussion of articial cells in thismonograph. Thus, no attempt is made here to describe the details ofthe methods. B.

Suspending aqueous solution containing NaCI (147 mM), CaClz (2.2 mM), and glucose (1 M). B.1.2. Procedure 1. Immediately before use, equal volumes of the hemoglobin solution and diamine solution are mixed and placed in a 30 mlglass syringe. The syringe is tted with an 18-gauge stainless steelneedle bent at right angles and placed in a Harvard infusionpump. 2. 80 ml of the sebacoyl chloride solution is added to a 140 mm diameter glass petri dish. 3. The tip of the 18-gauge needle is placed 5 mm above the surface of the sebacoyl chloride solution. 4. The infusion pump is operated at a flow rate of 2.6 ml/min for 1.6 min to produce 250 aqueous droplets. As the droplets fellinto the sebacoyl chloride solution, a nylon membrane is formedaround each droplet. 5. The petri dish containing the newly formed articial cells is gently agitated by hand for 5 min. After this, 20 ml of the sebacoylchloride solution containing 1 ml Span 85 (Atlas Powder Co.) isadded. 6. The polymerization is allowed to continue with intermittent gentle agitation of the petri dish by hand for a further 10 min. 7. To stop the reaction, the sebacoyl chloride solution is decanted and the articial cells are washed three times with 100 ml ofcyclohexane. 8. The cyclohexane is discarded after 15 min and replaced with the same volume of fresh cyclohexane. This is repeated twice. Afterthe last wash with cyclohexane, all the cyclohexane is removedby aspiration followed by evaporation with an air current. 9. The articial cells are then suspended in 100 ml of the suspending aqueous solution and washed three times with the same solution. 10. The articial cells are then used immediately for the flux measurements. The diameters of these large articial cells are3.1\u00b10.1 mm (mean:t S.D.).April membrane articial cells Polymer membrane articial cells are prepared by the drop method of B.1. followed by incorporation of the lipid component as follows. B.2.1. Materials 1. As in B.1.1. 2. Lipid solution containing 1.4 g egg lecithin (Nutritional Bio- chemical Co.) and 0.86 g cholesterol (Sigma Co.) in 100 ml oftetradecane are prepared on the day of use. B.2.2. Procedure 1. These are prepared using the procedure described above with the following modications. After the removal of cyclohexane byaspiration and evaporation, 50 ml of lipid dissolved in tetradecaneis added. 2. The articial cells are kept in a lipid solution in the same open glass petri dish in a fume cabinet for one hour with occasional agitation. The petri dish is tilted to keep the articial cells completely submerged in the lipid solution. 3. At the end of 1 h the lipid solution containing the articial cells is carefully layered over 80 ml of the suspending aqueous solution ina 150 ml glass beaker. The articial cells are transferred from theupper non-aqueous layer to the aqueous medium below by gentlestirring with a glass stirring rod, being careful not to rupture thearticial cells. As the articial cells entered the aqueous medium,excess lipid tends to accumulate on the top of the articial cells. As the excess lipid is removed by gentle stirring and washing with the aqueous solution, the articial cells settle to the bottom of thebeaker.(The lipid content of the articial cells can be measured.The lipid isextracted from the articial cells with chloroform. The chloroformextract is dried and analyzed for phospholipid by digestion andinorganic phosphate determination.)April 8, Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... Appendix FA Methods not Described in Detail in the 11 Chapters 365 B.3. Lipid-polymer membrane articial cells with macrocyclic carrier Lipid-polymer membrane articial cells are rst prepared using the method described in B.2. above. These are then suspended in anaqueous medium containing 5 \u00d710 6M valinomycin and 0.4% ethanol to allow the valinomycin to be incorporated into the lipidcomponent of the lipid-polymer membrane. In flux studies, the controlpolyamide articial cells and control lipid-polyamide articial cells arealso suspended in an aqueous medium with 0.4 ethanol but with novalinomycin. B.4. Incorporation of Na-K-ATPase to membrane of articial cells B.4.1. Materials 1. Diamine solution is not the same as that in B.1.; instead it contains 1,6-hexanediamine (0.1 M), NaOH (0.2 M). Filter with Whatman#42 paper. 2. Sebacoyl chloride solution is also not the same as that in B.1.; instead, it is formed by adding 0.4 ml sebacoyl chloride to 30 ml ofthe mixed organic solvent immediately before use. (Glass syringeused.) 3. ATPase is obtained from blood bank human red blood cells using the method of Nakoa et al. (1963). B.4.2. Procedure 1. A 30 ml glass syringe tted with an 18-gauge stainless steel needle and placed in a Harvard infusion pump, contains diamine solution(from B.4.1.) but with no hemoglobin. 2. Sebacoyl chloride solution (from B.4.1.).3. The steps after this are the same as the procedure for polyamide articial cells (B.4.2.) all the way to the step of suspension in theaqueous solution. 4. The following steps are for the incorporation of the ouabain- sensitive Na-K-ATPase into the articial cell membranes.April Appendix FA 366 Articial Cells 5. The articial cells are placed in a 3 ml beaker and all the suspending aqueous solution is removed. A solution consisting of 1 ml ofdiamine solution (from B.4.1.), 1 ml of the hemoglobin solution(from B.1.1.), and 0.2 ml of the ATPase solution containing 400 mgof protein (from B.4.1.) is added to the beaker containing thearticial cells. 6. Individual articial cells with a thin layer of diamine, hemoglobin, and ATPase on the surface are picked up using a hollow glass rod of 5 mm internal diameter and gently dropped into a petridish containing 100 ml of sebacoyl chloride solution (from B.4.1.). The polymerization is allowed to continue for 15 min. During this time, the Na +-K+-ATPase is incorporated in the membrane of each articial cell. 7. Finally, the articial cells are washed three times with 100 ml cyclohexane and the cyclohexane is decanted and evaporated afterthe nal washing. To transfer the articial cells from the organicto the aqueous medium, 10 ml of Tween 20 in 90 ml of distilledwater are added.The articial cells are washed 10 times with water,stored overnight in 500 ml of water at 4 C, and then washed another three times with 100 ml of water to remove any remaining traces of Tween 20.TheATPase-incorporated articial cells are then analyzed for ATPase activity.

To prevent the extruding sample fromoccluding the outlet of the surrounding air jet, the tip of the samplejet is constructed such that the tip projects 0.5 mm beyond the endof the air jet. 29. Droplet generator 2: It is a larger and slightly modied variant of the droplet generator 1. It is constructed with a 13G sample jet,and an 8G surrounding air jet. The ends of the jets are cut flushto each other. A 1.7 \u00d71.1 mm PTFE capillary tube (Pharmacia P-L Biochemicals; inserted into the sample jet untilit protrudes approximately 15 mm from the outlet of the samplejet. The end of the capillary tubing is tapered to facilitate shearingby the flow of passing air from the air jet. The capillary tubing isapproximately 3.2 m in length, and has the capacity to be lledwith microspheres suspended in 2.5 ml of sodium alginate. 30. Commercial generators are now available. They are easier to use and more reproducible. B.5.2. Procedure Preparation of rat hepatocytes 1. Each rat is anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and cannulated via the portal vein. 2. The thoracic vena cava is cut and the liver is perfused with a calcium-free perfusion buffer for 10 min at 40 ml/min. 3. Afterwards, the liver is perfused with the collagenase perfusion buffer for an additional 15 min at 25 ml/min. 4. The liver is then excised, placed in William's E medium supplemented with 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin and penicillin, and gently shaken to free loose liver cells from the liver tissue.April 8, 2007 9:23 SPI-B446Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... Appendix FA Methods not Described in Detail in the 11 Chapters 369 5. The cells are collected, ltered through a 74 \u00b5m nylon monolament mesh, and centrifuged to remove connective tissuedebris, cell clumps, non-parenchymal cells, and damaged cells. 6. Isolated hepatocytes are prepared for encapsulation by rst washing and suspending the cells with buffered saline. 7. The cells are then mixed with a 4% stock solution of sodium alginate, to make a cell suspension consisting of 20 \u00d710 6cells/ml of 2% sodium alginate. Preparation of rat bone marrow stem cells Each rat is anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital, and both femurs are isolated. Iscove's Modied Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM) is usedto flush out bone marrow cells from the femurs using a 5 ml syringewith a 22-gauge needle. The cell suspension is ltered through a nylonlter (85 \u00b5m). The bone marrow cells are then washed with IMDM and centrifuged at 50 g for 10 min at 4 C; this is repeated three times. After the last wash, the bone marrow cells (nucleated cells) are kept on iceuntil use. Genetically-engineered E. coli DH5 cells and microorganism 1. Genetically-engineered bacteria E. coli DH5, containing the urease gene from K. aerogenes , is used. LB growth medium is used for primary cell cultivation. Incubation is carried out in 5 mlLB in 16 ml culture tubes at 37 C in an orbital shaker at 120 rpm. For the large-scale production of biomass, for microencapsulationpurpose, a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 ml of thesuitable medium is used. 2. Log phase bacterial cells are harvested by centrifuging at 10,000 g for 20 min at 4 C. 3. Discard the supernatant, and wash the cell biomass with sterile cold water 5 times to remove media components by centrifugationat 10,000 g for 10 min at 4 C. 4. Suspend the bacterial cells in an autoclaved sodium alginate ice cold solution.April 8, Blood Substitutes, Appendix FA 370 Articial Cells 5. The viscous alginate-bacterial suspension is pressed through a 23- gauge needle using a syringe pump. 6. Compressed air through a 16-gauge needle is used to shear the droplets coming from the tip of the 23-gauge needle. 7. The droplets are allowed to gel for 15 min in a gently stirred ice- cold solution of calcium chloride (1.4%). 8. After gelation in the calcium chloride, alginate gel beads are coated with poly-l-lysine for 10 min. 9. The beads are then washed with HEPES and coated with an alginate solution (0.1%) for 4-8 min. 10. The alginate-poly-L-lysine-alginate capsules are then washed in a 3% citrate bath to liquefy the gel in the articial cells. Encapsulation using the standard method 1. Hepatocytes, hepatocytes and bone marrow cells, or bacterial cells are suspended in an autoclaved 0.9% sodium alginate ice coldsolution. 2. The viscous alginate suspension is pressed through a 23G stainless steel needle using a syringe pump. Sterile compressed air, througha 16G coaxial stainless steel needle, is used to shear the dropletscoming out of the tip of the 23G needle. 3. The droplets are allowed to gel for 15 min in a gently stirred, heat sterilized and ice cold calcium chloride solution. Upon contactwith the calcium chloride buffer, alginate gelation is immediate. 4. After gelation in the calcium chloride solution, alginate gel beads are reacted with poly-L-lysine (PLL), Mw 16,100 for 10 min The positively charged PLL forms a complex of semipermeable membrane. 5. The beads are then washed with HEPES, pH 7.2 and coated with an alginate solution (0.1%) for 4 min. 6. The alginate-poly-L-lysine-alginate capsules so formed are then washed in a 3% citrate bath to liquefy the gel in the articial cells. 7. The APA articial cells formed, which contains entrapped hepatocytes or bacterial cells, are stored at 4 C and used for experiments. The conditions are kept sterile during the process ofmicroencapsulation.April 8, 2007 9:23 SPI-B446Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... Appendix FA Methods not Described in Detail in the 11 Chapters 371 B.5.3. Comments 1. Alginates are heteropolymer carboxylic acids, 1-4 glycosidic bonds of -D-mannuronic (M) and -L-gluronic acid unit (G). Alkali alginate are soluble in water, whereas alginic acidsand the salts of polyvalent metal cations are insoluble.Thus, enters solution,rigid spherical gels are formed by ionoirotpic gelation. 2. All the solutions are kept in an ice-cold bath before use and during the process of bioencapsulation. The pH of the solutions is keptat 7.4 by buffering with HEPES. Except for sodium alginate, thesolutions are sterilized by ltering through a sterile 0.2 \u00b5m Millipore lter. 3. Alginate concentration in the tested range, 1.00-2.25% (w/v), does not affect the bacterial cell viability or cell growth. The qualityof articial cells improves with increasing alginate themaximum number of encapsulated bacterial cells. An increasein liquid flow rate of the alginate-cell or bacterial suspensionthrough the syringe pump from 0.00264 to 0.0369 ml/min resultedin increase in articial cell diameter. flow rate in the rangeof 0.00724 to 0.278 ml/min resulted in good spherical articialcells. At an air flow rate of 2 l/min., the articial cells have anaverage of 500 \u00b145\u00b5m diameter. At the air flow rates increase to above 3 l/min, the articial cells become irregular in shape. These results indicate that alginate concentration, air flow rate, and liquid flow rate are critical for obtaining articial cells of desiredcharacteristics and permselectivity (Prakash and Chang, 1996). We nd that the following composition is most suitable for our purpose: 2% (w/v) alginate, 0.0724 ml/min liquid flow rate, 2 l/min.air flow rate. Articial cells prepared in this way are permeableto albumin, but impermeable to molecules with higher molecularweights (Coromilli and Chang, 1993).Thus, larger molecular weighthepato-stimulating factors (Kashani and Chang, 1991) and globulin(Coromilli and Chang, 1993) cannot cross the membrane of thestandard articial cells.April 8, B.6. method for alginate-polylysine-alginate articial cells (tissues, cells, microorganisms) B.6.1. Procedure The standard method described above is not optimal for encapsulating high concentrations of cells or microorganisms. Cellsor microorganisms may be trapped in the membrane matrix. This canweaken the membrane. If the cells are exposed to the surface, thismay also result in loss of immunoisolation and rejection. As a result, atwo-step method has been developed to prevent this problem (Wongand Chang, 1991; Chang and Wong, 1992). 1. The hepatocytes or hepatocytes and bone marrow stem cells suspended in sodium alginate are entrapped within small solidcalcium alginate microspheres. This is done by lling a 5 mlsyringe with the cell suspension, and extruding the samplewith a syringe infusion pump through the sample jet of therst droplet generator. The droplets formed at the end of thesample jet are allowed to fall drop-wise into a Pyrex dish(125.65 mm) containing 300 ml CaCl 2solution. Every 5 min the cells in the syringe are resuspended by gentle inversion ofthe syringe to minimize the effect of cells sedimenting in thealginate solution. To prepare smaller droplets, the air flow andinfusion rate through the droplet generator are 2-3 l/min and 0.28-0.39 ml/min, respectively; the clearance height between the endof the sample jet and the surface of the calcium solution is setapproximately at 20 cm. A strainer cup is tted inside the dish tocollect the droplets, and to facilitate the removal of the formedmicrospheres. 2. The microspheres are allowed to cure for approximately 15 min, after which they are removed and temporarily stored in Hank'sBalanced Salt Solution supplemented with 10%, 100 mM CaCl 2. 3. 1.0 ml of formed microspheres are collected and washed three times with buffered saline. 4. The nal saline washing is aspirated and 1 ml of 1.2-1.6% sodium alginate is added to 1.0 ml of washed microspheres. The sodiumApril 8, 2007 9:23 SPI-B446Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... Appendix FA Methods not Described in Detail in the 11 Chapters 373 alginate is prepared by diluting the 4% stock solution with buffered saline. With a 5 ml syringe, the length of the PTFE capillary tubingis lled with the sodium alginate and a suspension of microspheres. The tapered end of the capillary tubing is inserted through the top of the sample jet of the second droplet generator until thetip of the tubing extended approximately 15 mm beyond the endof the sample jet. In order to prepare larger droplets that containthe smaller alginate microspheres, the air flow and should be respectively. The tip of the capillary tubing is setapproximately 20 cm above the surface of the calcium solution. With a 5 ml syringe still attached to the other end of the tubing, the microspheres suspension in the tubing is extruded with a Harvardinfusion pump. Similarly, the drops formed at the end of the samplejet are allowed to fall dropwise into a Pyrex dish containing astrainer cup and lled with 300 ml of 100 mM CaCl 2. 5. The spheres are allowed to cure in the calcium solution for approximately 15 min, after which they are removed and washed with buffered saline. 6. The alginic acid matrix on the surface of the sphere is stabilized with poly-l-lysine by immersing 5 ml (settled volume) of macrospheresin 80 ml of 0.05% poly-l-lysine-fructose solution for 10 min. 7. The spheres are then drained, washed with buffered saline, and immersed into 200 ml of 0.2% sodium alginate for 10 min to applyan external layer of alginate. 8. After 10 min, the spheres are collected and immersed in 200 ml 50 mM sodium citrate solution to solubilize the intracapsular calcium alginate. This may require up to 30 min with frequentchanges of the sodium citrate solution. B.6.2. Comments The two-step method prevents the entrapment of small cells in the membrane matrix. Articial cells prepared in this way, whenimplanted, are much more stable and with reduced rejection (Wongand Chang, 1991; Chang and Wong, 1992).April 8, B.7. Macroporous agar membrane articial cells When using cells or microorganisms to act on macromolecules, the above methods cannot be used. Thus, in using microorganisms toact on cholesterol bound to lipoprotein, the microorganisms have in macroporous articial cells 2% agar and 2% sodium alginate is autoclaved cooled 45Ct o5 0C. 2.Pseudomonas pictorum is cultured in nutrient broth at 25C, followed by harvesting and resuspension in a cholesterol medium. After the suspension is cultured for 15 days at 25C, it is used as an inoculum for biomass production. The culture is grownin bovine calf serum at 37 C for 36 h, and then harvested. This is used to prepare bacterial suspensions for immobilization. Theconcentration is about 0.4 mg of dry comments ). B.7.2. Procedure 0.4 ml of 0.9% NaCl is added dropwise to 3.6 ml of agar alginate solution at 45C, with stirring carried out vigorously. 4. 3 ml of the mixture obtained is kept at 45C while it is being extruded through the syringe. The extruded drops are collected intocold (4 C) 2% calcium chloride and allow to harden. These agar- alginate beads are about 2 mm in diameter. 5. After 15 min, the supernatant is discarded and the beads are resuspended in 2% sodium citrate for 15 min. 6. Then, they are washed and stored in 0.9% saline at 4C. When testing for immobilized bacterial activity, 1 ml of beads/articial cells is placed in a sterile 50 ml flask. 5 ml of serum are added and afoam plug is tted. Samples are withdrawn at specied intervals. Whenempty beads or articial cells are prepared, the bacterial suspensionis replaced by saline, and all the other steps are kept the same.April 8, 2007 9:23 SPI-B446Articial Cells: Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood Substitutes, Regenerative... Appendix FA Methods not Described in Detail in the 11 Chapters 375 B.7.3. Comments 1. Temperature is a very critical parameter in the immobilization of P. pictorum (Garofalo and Chang, 1991). A low temperature produces gelation of the polymer in the syringe or conduits. A high temperatureprevents gelation but increases the mortality rate of P . pictorum . Exposing P . pictorum to 55 C for 10 min or more can completely inhibit enzymatic activity. However, up to 20 min of exposure to 45C does not signicantly inhibit cholesterol activity. Open pore agar beadsstored at 4 C did not show any sign of deterioration. The beads retain its enzymatic activity even after 9 mth of storage.This page intentionally left blankThis page intentionally left blankMay 8, Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Blood compared with biweekly dosing produces childhood relapsed Verhoest, C.R.
