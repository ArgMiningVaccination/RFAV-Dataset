Even if records are subpoenaed by the court HIPPA laws extend to the personal notes of the therapist and are not to be shared. All communication between clients and psychologists is confidential and protected by the law. There are certain exceptions such as the \"duty to warn\" if the provider learns that a client plans to harm themselves or another person. Psychologists, psychiatrists and therapists are also legally obligated to report any child abuse. When billing insurance companies, some confidential information must be given to the company in order to process claims. If you have any questions on the specifics of the information requested by your healthcare plan, we would be happy to discuss that with you directly when you call.
