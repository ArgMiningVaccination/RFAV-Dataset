COURSE CONTENT: The speciality of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery deals with the diagnosis and management of the diseases of stomatognathic system, jaw bones, cranio-maxillofacial region, salivary glands and temporomandibular joints etc. Within this framework it also supports many vital organs like eye, oropharynx, nasopharynx and major blood vessels and nerves. The traumatic injuries of maxillofacial skeleton are independently managed by Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeons. Whenever there are orbital injuries the ophthalmologists are trained only to tackle injuries of the eye ball (globe) but if there are associated injuries of the orbital skeleton, the Maxillofacial Surgeon is involved in its re-construction. Similarly, nasal bone fracture may be managed by ENT surgeons. Most of the time nasal bone fractures are associated with fractures of the maxilla, mandible and zygomatic bones which are being managed by Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeons. The maxillofacial facial injuries at times are associated with head injuries also. The Oral & maxillofacial Surgeon is involved in the management of cleft lip & cleft palate, orthognathic surgery, micro vascular surgery, reconstructive and oncological surgical procedures of maxillofacial region. The speciality of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery is a multi disciplinary speciality and needs close working in co-ordination with Neurosurgeons, Oncosurgeons, Opthalmologists, ENT Surgeons and Plastic Surgeons. The Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeons, Ophthalmologist, ENT Surgeons, Plastic Surgeons, Neuro-Surgeons and Oncologists complement each other by performing Surgical Procedures with their respective expertise and knowledge thereby benefiting the patients and students of the respective specialities. The program outline addresses both the knowledge needed in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and allied medical specialties in its scope. A minimum of three years of formal training through a graded system of education as specified will equip the trainee with skill and knowledge at its completion to be able to practice basic oral and Maxillofacial surgery competently and have the ability to intelligently pursue further apprenticeship towards advanced Maxillofacial surgery.
