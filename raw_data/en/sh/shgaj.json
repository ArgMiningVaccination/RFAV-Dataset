Dr. Hotez, a pediatrician-scientist who develops vaccines for neglected tropical diseases affecting the world's poorest people, became troubled by the decades-long rise of the influential anti-vaccine community and their inescapable narrative around childhood vaccines and autism. The alleged link between the two was first espoused in a fraudulent scientific paper, long since retracted, but the story shows no signs of letting up. As a result, we've seen deadly and disabling outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases around the country, and Texas, where Hotez lives, is at particular risk. In Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel's Autism, Hotez draws on his experiences as a pediatrician, vaccine scientist, and father of an autistic child. Outlining the arguments on both sides of the debate, he examines the science that refutes the concerns of the anti-vaccine movement, debunks current conspiracy theories alleging a cover-up by the CDC, and critiques the scientific community's failure to effectively communicate the facts about vaccines and autism to the general public, all while sharing his very personal story of raising a now-adult daughter with autism.

I was hoping the majority of the book was more of an in-depth dive into how ASD was detectable while children are still in the womb, but it only spent a short time on that subject. That study in and of itself is a kind of silver bullet to the whole \"vaccines cause autism\" argument and the author sort of missed his chance to capitalize on that by not making that study the foundation of the book. This is a fight for the hearts and minds of parents, and he tied one hand behind his back. 5 people found this helpful - Overall - [Wife Reviews](/listener/amzn1.account.AGEPDNHYYU2Q63QERW6BOJTIAHMQ?ref=a_pd_Vaccin_c15_rvlsnl_4&pf_rd_p=688a1b7e-3d44-49e7-a3fe-2be4c28264cd&pf_rd_r=NFDK7N1JDC85MSGF535J&pageLoadId=llef55SHUUiapsTx&creativeId=88c226af-6ce7-461c-9842-163d82e49648) - 01-05-20 Great and Tragic This book is filled with really good information and it's sad that many predators are pawning out pseudo science to scare parents into reconsidering decades of scientific research to combat autism when instead resources should be placed on supporting families dealing with autism. 4 people found this helpful - Overall - Performance - Story - [Binks & Jazzy](/listener/amzn1.account.AECC7DZRUDOSFSMUENU4WXQJIKVQ?ref=a_pd_Vaccin_c15_rvlsnl_5&pf_rd_p=688a1b7e-3d44-49e7-a3fe-2be4c28264cd&pf_rd_r=NFDK7N1JDC85MSGF535J&pageLoadId=llef55SHUUiapsTx&creativeId=88c226af-6ce7-461c-9842-163d82e49648) - 04-11-19 A must read for Pediatricians.
