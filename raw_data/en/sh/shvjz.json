They are located in the lower back, just below the ribcage. The kidneys filter waste from the blood and produce urine. They also help regulate blood pressure, electrolyte balance, and red blood cell production ( [14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538339/)). Over time, the kidneys can become damaged due to disease, infection, or other factors. This can lead to kidney dysfunction or a decrease in kidney function ( [19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4089662/)). Kidney cleansing herbs are thought to help boost kidney function and improve overall health. In this article, we'll list 10 of the most popular kidney cleansing herbs and explain how they are said to benefit your health.

Exercise Regularly Exercise is not only great for your overall health, but it can also help promote kidney function. Exercise helps blood flow increase and helps the kidneys to filter out toxins more effectively ( [10](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6567229/)). A combination of aerobic and strength-training exercises is best, but any type of exercise is better than none at all. Make Sure You're Getting Enough Sleep Sleep is essential for good health, and that includes kidney health. When you're sleep-deprived, your body's ability to fight infection and repair itself is impaired ( [22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6281147/)). Try to get 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. Manage Your Weight Being overweight or obese puts extra strain on your kidneys ( [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5433675/)).

If you're having trouble losing weight, talk to your doctor about a weight loss plan that's right for you. Don't Smoke Smoking is bad for your health, period. But it's especially harmful to the kidneys. Smoking increases the risk of kidney cancer and can also damage the blood vessels, leading to kidney disease ( [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2669551/)). If you smoke, quitting is one of the best things you can do for your health, including your kidneys. Limit Your Intake Of Alcohol While moderate alcohol consumption isn't necessarily harmful, heavy drinking can put a strain on the kidneys and lead to damage ( [19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4089662/)). If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. What Are The Signs That A Kidney Detox Is Working?
