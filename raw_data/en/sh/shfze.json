Some of these questions may seem unrelated to your main complaint, but Chinese herbal medicine focuses on how all of your body systems connect to each other and how they may be involved in your condition. Your practitioner will describe the imbalance that is leading to your symptoms and will suggest a treatment plan.

Some acute conditions only need one course of herbs but for chronic, harder to treat conditions you will need to commit to taking Chinese herbal formulas for a couple of months. When a patient is taking herbs we like to see them every one to two weeks, since we change the formula according to how they are progressing. We might prescribe one formula to treat acute symptoms and once those are resolved move on to another formula that will address the patient's underlying condition. Most formulas are not meant to be taken for long periods of time and can create dryness, dampness or excess heat if used incorrectly.

While we refer to the organ by the anatomical name given to it in Western medicine, in TCM the definition is not as rigid, instead referring more to the body's functions.
