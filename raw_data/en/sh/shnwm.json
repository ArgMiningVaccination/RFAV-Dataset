For more ways to enjoy lentils, you might enjoy these recipes for Ingredients - Rice: I recommend jasmine rice or basmati rice. Brown rice is not recommended in Ayurvedic recipes, as the husk can cause gut irritation/gas. - Moong Dal: You can use either yellow split mung beans (mung dal/moong dal) which is the best option, though red lentils would work in a pinch) or dried yellow split peas. - Vegetables: You'll need four cups of chopped vegetables; zucchini, carrot, broccoli, asparagus, sweet potato, spinach, etc. - Coconut milk: Use canned coconut milk- full fat or light would work. - Vegetable broth: You can use reduced-sodium or regular broth and adjust the salt accordingly. - Coconut oil: Ayurveda uses ghee, butter, and coconut oil for cooking. Since this is a vegan recipe, I've used coconut oil. - Spices: This kitchari recipe uses a combination of spices, including cumin seeds, fenugreek seeds, coriander seeds (or ground coriander), mustard seeds, ground turmeric, fresh ginger (or powdered), and salt and pepper. - Herbs: I recommend cilantro or parsley to garnish. Read the recipe card below for the full ingredients list, measurements, complete recipe method, and nutritional information. Optional add-ins and variations: - Rice-free: There are several options to choose from, though they won't be the traditional Ayurvedic version. Tapioca pearls, millet, and quinoa would all work. However, you'll need to adjust the cooking time accordingly. - Cinnamon: You can add one cinnamon stick (or use 2 tsp powdered cinnamon). Remove before eating the dish. - Cardamom pods: 3-4 whole cardamom pods could be added with the spices. - Bay leaves: 2-3 bay leaves can be added at the beginning; remove before eating. - Yogurt: You can optionally serve the kitchari cleanse bowl with a dollop of plain, dairy-free yogurt. - Protein: While these options aren't gut-friendly for all, you can optionally add some firm tofu, seitan, or tempeh to the dish for more flavor. How to Make Kitchari? - First, clean and chop the vegetables of your choice. - Then, heat the coconut oil in a large pan (or pot) over medium heat. Once hot, add the whole seeds and fry for 30 seconds (or until fragrant and beginning to pop). Then mix in the fresh ginger, turmeric, salt, and pepper. - Next, add the chopped veggies to the pan and stir to combine. - Also, add the rice, yellow split beans (or lentils), and vegetable broth. Stir to combine and then bring to a simmer. Allow the mixture to simmer over low heat for between 20-25 minutes. - Then cover the pan with a lid and simmer for a further 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally. - Add the coconut milk and spinach, stir, and allow it to simmer for a further 5 minutes, or until you've reached your desired consistency. If you prefer a 'soupier' dish, add a little more veggie broth or coconut milk. - Finally, taste the kitchari and adjust any of the seasonings/spices. Then serve and enjoy! How to Store Store: Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. Freeze: Kitchari freezes very well. Allow it to cool and then store in freezer-safe containers/bags (portioned) for up to 4 months. Allow it to thaw in the fridge overnight (or at room temperature for 3-4 hours) before reheating. Reheating: The best way to reheat the dish is on the stovetop- adding a splash of extra water/broth if needed. However, you could also use a microwave for 2-3 minutes. Recipe Notes and FAQs - Choosing the legume/bean: I've provided three options to choose from, so feel free to simply use whatever is available to you. However, if you're following an Ayurvedic cleanse, split mung beans (moong dal) are considered Ayurveda's ultimate 'cleansing bean' and the only bean not to cause gas. They are also packed with several health benefits, including [flavonoids](https://www.netmeds.com/health-library/post/moong-dal-these-5-incredible-health-reasons-will-make-you-add-green-gram-to-your-daily-diet). - Instant Pot version: First, add the oil and spices to the instant pot and saut\u00e9, constantly stirring, until fragrant and beginning to pop. Then add the veggies, dry rice, and beans, stir, add the stock, and cancel the saut\u00e9 button. Cover with the lid and cook on high pressure for 7-8 minutes (8 will be a porridge-like tender consistency). Then, either allow the pressure to naturally release (for more tender kitchari) or manually release the valve (for slightly firmer results). - Adjust the cooking time to the legume: Depending on whether you choose lentils, split peas, or moong dal, the cooking time may vary somewhat. - Sort the lentils/legume: It's a good idea to sift through the mung dal/lentils to ensure no impurities, stones, etc., in the mixture. - Wash the rice/Legumes: While technically optional, you can remove excess starch from the ingredients by rinsing the two ingredients (separately) until the water runs almost clear. - Using garlic and onion: While a classic inclusion to many dal recipes, I've avoided them here as they aren't recommended in Ayurvedic recipes.
