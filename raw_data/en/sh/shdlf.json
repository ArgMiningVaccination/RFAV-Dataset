When you are ready to address the cause of your TMJ-D, we are here to serve you. We look forward to it. To Request an Action Plan to Address TMJ - D TemporoMandibular Joint Dysfunction [Click Here](requestactionplan.asp) Your temporomandibular joint is a hinge that connects your jaw to the temporal bones of your skull, which are in front of each ear. It lets you move your jaw up and down and side to side, so you can talk, chew, and yawn. Problems with your jaw and the muscles in your face that control it are known as temporomandibular disorders (TMD). But you may hear it wrongly called TMJ, after the joint. TMD often causes severe pain and discomfort. It can be temporary or last many years. It might affect one or both sides of your face. More women than men have it, and it's most common among people between the ages of 20 and 40. Common symptoms include: You may also have Traditional Allopathic Doctors don't know what causes TMD. Dentists believe symptoms arise from problems with the muscles of your jaw or with the parts of the joint itself. Consider Dr. Huntoon's Alternative explanation below. Injury to your jaw, the joint, or the muscles of your head and neck -- like from a heavy blow or whiplash -- can lead to TMD. Other causes include: Many other conditions cause similar symptoms -- like tooth decay, sinus problems, arthritis, or gum disease. To figure out what's causing yours, the dentist will ask about your health history and conduct a physical exam. He'll check your jaw joints for pain or tenderness and listen for clicks, pops, or grating sounds when you move them. He'll also make sure your jaw works like it should and doesn't lock when you open or close your mouth. Plus he'll test your bite and check for problems with your facial muscles. Your dentist may take full face X-rays so he can view your jaws, temporomandibular joints, and teeth to rule out other problems. He may need to do other tests, like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computer tomography (CT). The MRI can show if the TMJ disc is in the proper position as your jaw moves. A CT scan shows the bony detail of the joint. You may get referred to an oral surgeon (also called an oral and maxillofacial surgeon) for further care and treatment. This doctor specializes in surgery in and around the entire face, mouth, and jaw area. You may also see an orthodontist to ensure your teeth, muscles, and joints work like they should. Talk to your dentist about these treatments for TMD: Your dentist can prescribe higher doses of NSAIDs if you need them for pain and swelling. He might suggest a muscle relaxer to relax your jaw if you grind or clench your teeth. Or an anti-anxiety medication to relieve stress, which may bring on TMD. In low doses they can also help reduce or control pain. Muscle relaxants, anti-anxiety drugs, and antidepressants are available by prescription only. These plastic mouthpieces fit over your upper and lower teeth so they don't touch. They lessen the effects of clenching or grinding and correct your bite by putting your teeth in a more correct position. What's the difference between them? You wear night guards while you sleep. You use a splint all the time. Your dentist will tell you which type you need. Your dentist can replace missing teeth and use crowns, bridges, or braces to balance the biting surfaces of your teeth or to correct a bite problem. If the treatments listed above don't help, your dentist may suggest one or more of the following: If other treatments can't help you, surgery is an option. Once it's done, it can't be undone, so get a second or even third opinion from other dentists. There are three types of surgery for TMD. The type you need depends on the problem. You'll get general anesthesia, then the doctor will open up the entire area around the joint so he can get a full view and better access. You'll need longer to heal after open-joint surgery, and there is a greater chance of scarring and nerve injury. [Medicines Two Choices](MedicinesTwoChoices.asp) for You There are things you can do on your own to help relieve TMD symptoms. Your doctor may suggest you try some of these remedies together. Having taught anatomy for 5 years at both the college and grad-school level, Dr. Huntoon has seen up-close the inner workings of all the muscles, joints, nerves and tendons, along with each disc associated with the TMJ. And in the course of teaching anatomy to others, he developed quite an accurate and complete understanding of this interesting pair of joints, what controls them and how they go out of balance. He also developed a very effective solution to TMJ-D and has successfully applied it to hundreds of practice members for over 27 years. Assessment involves determining if the problem is with Each has a different CAUSE and each would also have a different solution. Usually associated with the TMD is an imbalance between what one is thinking (upper jaw) and what one is feeling (lower jaw) creating the tension within the joint(s) itself. Most times, it starts on one side versus the other and the pain associated with the imbalance can be from the primary side or the secondary side of dysfunction. Having the ability to determine where the CAUSE is coming from and properly addressing this is not difficult when you have seen as many as Dr. Huntoon has over the past 27 years. Correction involves a simple manipulation of the primary TMJ, massaging the appropriate muscles associated with the mechanism of dysfunction and advising what the person needs to be aware of for the next 24 to 48 hours. And in greater than 95 % of the people Dr. Huntoon has seen for this concern, all have full resolution to their TMD and can go back to their normal life after ONE visit. A couple of them have required 2 visits, but never any more than that. Thanks Again, Kimberly Patenaude In greater than 95 % of the people Dr. Huntoon has seen for this concern, all have full resolution to their TMD and can go back to their normal life after ONE visit. A couple of them have required 2 visits, but never any more than that. Certainly consider this first BEFORE agreeing to expensive dental treatment like grinding your teeth down, having surgery or having teeth extracted. All of these will only lead to further complications and a long road to getting back to some semblance of normalcy. In the past, various procedures such as dental restoration and orthodontic treatment were used to prevent joint sounds from developing into TMDs. Such measures are not only unneeded but also potentially damaging to a joint that may never become painful on its own.
