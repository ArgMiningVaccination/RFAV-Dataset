Vaccinations and malaria risk Review both the Vaccination and Malaria sections on this page to find out if you may need vaccines and/or a malaria risk assessment before you travel to this country. If you think you require vaccines and/or malaria risk assessment, you should make an appointment with a travel health professional: A travel health risk assessment is also advisable for some people, even when vaccines or malaria tablets are not required. Risk prevention advice Many of the health risks experienced by travellers cannot be prevented by vaccines and other measures need to be taken. Always make sure you understand the wider risks at your destination and take precautions, including: Our advice section gives detailed information on minimising specific health risks abroad: Other health considerations Make sure you have [travel insurance](/advice/general-travel-health-advice/travel-insurance) before travel to cover healthcare abroad.

Vaccinations - Confirm primary courses and boosters are up to date as recommended for life in Britain - including for example, [seasonal flu vaccine](https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/advice/disease-prevention-advice/flu-influenza)(if indicated), [MMR](http://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/advice/disease-prevention-advice/measles), vaccines required for occupational risk of exposure, lifestyle risks and underlying medical conditions. - Courses or boosters usually advised: none. - Other vaccines to consider: Diphtheria; Hepatitis A; Hepatitis B; Rabies; Tetanus; Typhoid. - Selectively advised vaccines - only for those individuals at highest risk: Japanese Encephalitis. - Yellow fever vaccination certificate required for travellers aged 9 months or over arriving from countries with [risk of yellow fever transmission](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/yellow-fever/yellow-fever-risk-areas)and for travellers having transited more than 12 hours through an airport of a country with risk of yellow fever transmission. Notes on the diseases mentioned above - [Diphtheria](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/diphtheria): spread person to person through respiratory droplets. Risk is higher if mixing with locals in poor, overcrowded living conditions. - [Hepatitis A](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/hepatitis-a): spread through consuming contaminated food and water or person to person through the faecal-oral route. Risk is higher where personal hygiene and sanitation is poor. Risk is highest for those with underlying medical conditions where there is increased risk of severe disease e.g. chronic liver/kidney disease; haemophiliacs; men who have sex with men; people who inject drugs. - [Hepatitis B](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/hepatitis-b): spread through infected blood and blood products, contaminated needles and medical instruments and sexual intercourse. Risk is higher for long stays, frequent travel and for children (exposed through cuts and scratches), those who may require medical treatment during travel. Risk is highest for those with underlying medical conditions where there is increased risk of severe disease e.g. chronic liver/kidney disease; haemophiliacs; men who have sex with men; people who change partners frequently; people who inject drugs. - [Japanese Encephalitis](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/japanese-encephalitis): spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. This mosquito breeds in rice paddies and mainly bites between dusk and dawn. Risk is highest for long stay travellers to rural areas, particularly if unable to avoid mosquito bites. - [Rabies](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/rabies): spread through the saliva of infected animals (especially dogs, cats, bats and monkeys), usually through a bite, scratch or lick to broken skin. Risk is higher for those working or living in remote or rural areas (with no easy access to medical facilities), longer stay travellers, those planning on undertaking activities such as trekking, cycling or running in a ['high risk'](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/rabies/rabies-risk-areas)country, those working with, or regularly handling animals or bats, as part of their job, and children. Even after receiving pre-travel rabies vaccine, urgent medical advice should be sought after any animal or bat bite. - [Tetanus](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/tetanus): spread through contamination of cuts, burns and wounds with tetanus spores. Spores are found in soil worldwide. A total of 5 doses of tetanus vaccine are recommended for life in the UK. Boosters are usually recommended in a country or situation where the correct treatment of an injury may not be readily available. - [Typhoid](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/typhoid): spread mainly through consumption of contaminated food and drink. Risk is higher where access to adequate sanitation and safe water is limited. Malaria Malaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease transmitted by mosquitoes.You cannot be vaccinated against malaria. Malaria precautions [Malaria Map](/destinations/asia-east/thailand/thailand-malaria-map) - Malaria risk exists in the forested and hilly areas mainly towards the international borders, all year round.
