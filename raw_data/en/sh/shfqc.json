It's essential not just for the health of the person [getting the vaccine](https://www.self.com/story/from-anti-to-pro-vaccine) but also for the health of others in the community. But if you've followed the conversations around vaccines, you've probably seen the phrase medical exemptions pop up more than a few times. Medical exemptions are at the crux of some of the most contentious arguments over how vaccination requirements should work, and more precisely who should be vaccinated in the first place. Here's what you need to know about medical exemptions for vaccines, including why they should really only be given in the rare cases when they're absolutely necessary. Why some people need medical exemptions from vaccinations In theory medical exemptions are pretty straightforward. \"The general intent is to allow children who can't be vaccinated for medical reasons to still be entered into school,\" [Walter A. Orenstein](http://vaccines.emory.edu/faculty-evc/primary-faculty/orenstein_walter.html), M.D., professor of medicine, epidemiology, global health, and pediatrics at Emory University, associate director of the [Emory Vaccine Center](http://www.emory.edu/home/index.html), and director of Emory Vaccine Policy and Development, tells SELF. All 50 states, Washington, D.C., and all U.S. territories have laws mandating vaccination for entry into school and childcare, the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/schoolvaxview/requirements/index.html) (CDC) explains. This is in order to make sure that rates of vaccination are high and rates of [vaccine-preventable diseases](https://www.self.com/story/treating-vaccine-preventable-illness) (VPDs) are low. These requirements are not federal law, however, and therefore vary from state to state. But according to the CDC's [Public Health Law Program](https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/docs/school-vaccinations.pdf) (PHLP), these laws almost always apply to public schools, private schools, and day cares. So if you want to send your child to any kind of school, they need to be vaccinated. However, there are some exceptions. Children who have contraindications for vaccination can be granted a medical exemption\u2014meaning that they don't have to show proof of vaccination in order to enter school or day care. Children with contraindications for vaccines cannot safely be vaccinated because they have medical conditions that might lead to a bad reaction to a vaccine. To be clear, bad reactions to vaccines are extremely rare in the general population\u2014but there are certain [health conditions](https://www.self.com/health-conditions) that raise these normally highly unlikely odds. That's why these health conditions are called contraindications\u2014the vaccine is indicated [for the safety of all children](https://www.self.com/story/child-adolescent-immunization-schedule), but a child's condition means their parents should go against that recommendation (contra). Contraindications can apply to one or more vaccines and they are often temporary, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/contraindications.html), meaning that the child can get the vaccine after the contraindication is no longer present. A step down from contraindications, there are also precautions for vaccination that can similarly result in medical exemptions. \"A precaution means just that: Proceed with caution,\" [Saad B. Omer](https://www.saadomer.org/saad-b-omer.html), Ph.D., M.P.H., inaugural director of the [Yale Institute for Global Health](https://medicine.yale.edu/yigh/), professor of infectious diseases at Yale School of Medicine, and the Susan Dwight Bliss professor of epidemiology of microbial diseases at the Yale School of Public Health, tells SELF. In these cases doctors are supposed to use their clinical judgment when deciding if it makes sense to recommend the vaccine anyway. Generally [the recommendation](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/contraindications.html) is to delay vaccines as long as the precaution is present, although the protection a vaccine provides may be greater than the risk of a reaction. It's really a case-by-case thing. As with vaccine requirements, all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and U.S. territories have their own laws regarding medical exemptions, per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/schoolvaxview/requirements/exemption.html), but they all permit them in some form. Most states also offer two types of exemptions for reasons that have nothing to do with health: religious and/or philosophical, meaning a child can be excused from a [vaccine](https://www.self.com/story/what-is-herd-immunity) on the grounds of religious or personal beliefs. You'll see why this distinction matters so much in a bit. For now, let's dive into medical exemptions. What counts as a medical exemption Here's where things start to get a little more complex. \"[Doctors] have a very standard list as to what should and shouldn't be considered a medical contraindication to vaccination,\" Dr. Orenstein says. [This list](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/contraindications.html) is put together by the [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/index.html) (ACIP), a committee within the CDC, and issued in conjunction with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP). Its goal is to best protect children's health across the United States. For example, a contraindication for most commonly used vaccines is the extremely rare instance that someone has had a \"severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose or to a vaccine component,\" per the [ACIP](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/contraindications.html). Someone having a severe allergic reaction to a vaccine (which can happen with any medication) only happens in an estimated [one in a million doses](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm). As another example, a contraindication for vaccines someone has severe immunodeficiency, which can be caused by something like [HIV](https://www.self.com/story/prep-hiv-prevention), a treatment like chemotherapy, or long-term immunosuppressive therapy, according to the [ACIP](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/contraindications.html). [Severe immunodeficiency](https://www.self.com/story/parent-child-who-cant-get-vaccines) is basically the only time it's possible for a vaccine\u2014and even then only a live, attenuated vaccine\u2014to give someone the illness it's meant to protect against, like measles or chicken pox. Live, attenuated vaccines use alive but extremely weak versions of the pathogen in question rather than dead versions. This won't make a person with a typically functioning immune system sick, but if someone's immune system is very weak, doctors often don't want to take that chance. Then there are various precautions for vaccination, which can fall into a few different buckets. One is if the vaccine may increase the child's risk of a serious adverse reaction, but less so than a contraindication would, according to the [ACIP](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/contraindications.html). An example is how having an egg allergy that has caused breathing problems in the past [is a precaution](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/contraindications.html) for flu vaccination because most flu vaccines are made through an egg-based process. That doesn't mean a child with this type of egg allergy automatically shouldn't get vaccinated for the flu, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/egg-allergies.htm) explains. Remember those one-in-a-million odds of a severe allergic reaction to a vaccine? Skipping the flu vaccine in this case wouldn't be warranted. Instead, it means that a child with this type of allergy [should get vaccinated for the flu](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/egg-allergies.htm) by a health-care provider who has good knowledge of allergic reactions, just in case. Another overarching precaution is if you're sick with something else at the time\u2014even just a mild cold. The reason for this is because doctors don't want you to think that your illness symptoms were caused by the vaccine. Like any other medication, vaccines can sometimes cause [mild side effects](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm) that typically go away all on their own (like a low-grade fever, a rash, and swelling of neck glands). It can be easy to misattribute these symptoms to an unrelated illness or vice versa. For this reason \"moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever\" is a precaution for all vaccines, according to the [ACIP](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/contraindications.html). This is a great example of how medical exemptions can get a little hazy. Although there's a standard list of contraindications and precautions for [vaccination](https://www.self.com/story/parents-questions-vaccines), sometimes there's ambiguity in the language that can leave room for interpretation. The \"moderate or severe acute illness\" precaution for vaccination doesn't actually define the moderate or severe acute illnesses in question. It also doesn't say how long a health-care provider should consider delaying a vaccine in this case\u2014only that the person can get vaccinated after they have been screened for contraindications and their acute illness has improved. \"There's room for clinical judgment there,\" [Daniel Salmon](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/1015/daniel-salmon), Ph.D., M.P.H., professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, tells SELF. This isn't necessarily a bad thing \"if the doctor is well-informed in the science and [writes medical exemptions] consistent with the science,\" Salmon says. But it does create an opportunity for some vaccine-hesitant parents to get unnecessary medical exemptions for their children, ultimately putting their kids and others [at risk of illness or even death](https://www.self.com/story/whooping-cough-in-the-picu). How medical exemptions work The details of this whole process depend on where you live. \"We don't have a standardized way of doing things across states because they're state laws,\" Salmon says. Some states may require a written physician's statement detailing the contraindication while others only require a simple form to be filled out, according to a 2012 paper (coauthored by Omer) published in [The Journal of Infectious Diseases](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/206/7/989/806132). One major variable is who is allowed to fill out these medical exemption forms (or write medical exemption statements) to replace the proof of immunization that's usually required for school or day-care entry. States generally permit doctors with M.D.s to write these, Dr. Orenstein says, and often doctors with D.O.s as well. (If you're wondering what the difference is, we have a whole deep dive for you [right here](https://www.self.com/story/do-vs-md).) Some also allow nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and other medical professionals to write them. In general, though, whether or not there needs to be a detailed explanation of what the medical exemption is varies based on location (just like pretty much everything else about medical exemptions). In some cases, \"the doctor doesn't necessarily have to justify the medical exemption...they just have to say, 'This child has a medical exemption,' \" Dr. Orenstein explains. \"Then you have the issue of what happens to those exemptions,\" Salmon points out. Frequently the form simply gets accepted by the school and that's that, Diane C. Peterson, associate director for Immunization Projects at the Immunization Action Coalition, tells SELF. But in other cases the form gets sent to and reviewed by the state or local health department for approval, Peterson says. Whether or not this happens depends on both state and local laws, school procedures, and if the health department and schools have agreed to work together as part of the protocol. The steps involved in the review and approval process are not standardized and depend on the jurisdiction. They can vary based on whether or not grounds for exemption denial are coded in the law or just up to the discretion of whoever is reviewing the form, if all exemption forms get reviewed regularly or just upon request by the school or the state, and what resources (time, people, money) the involved departments can spend on reviewing medical exemption requests. According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/docs/school-vaccinations.pdf), some states only grant temporary exemptions that expire after a period of time, which may require regular recertification, while others offer permanent exemptions. When medical exemptions are misused Now we're at the part where medical exemptions get really controversial. \"The concern is whether the term 'medical exemption' is being abused,\" Dr. Orenstein says. This is mainly a concern in states where it's easy to get a medical exemption but hard or even illegal to get a nonmedical one. In those states some doctors will write medical exemptions for children that aren't actually necessary, which can drive down the overall rates of [vaccinated](https://www.self.com/story/vaccine-hesitant-patients) children in those areas. (Getting unnecessary medical exemptions wouldn't necessarily drive down the overall vaccination rate in states where people can get either medical or nonmedical exemptions, because parents who can't get the former for their children can instead try to get the latter.) Exemptions for people with objections to [immunization](https://www.self.com/story/hpv-vaccine-advocate) based on sincerely held religious beliefs are currently available in 45 states; and exemptions based on personal, moral, or philosophical beliefs exist in 15 states, according to the [National Conference of State Legislatures](http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/school-immunization-exemption-state-laws.aspx) (NCSL). As with medical exemptions, the ease of getting nonmedical exemptions differs among states. For example, in some states the parent has to get a religious leader or state official to vouch for their exemption or visit the health department, per a 2017 study published in [Open Forum Infectious Diseases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5798011/) that Omer coauthored. The distinction between medical and nonmedical exemptions matters because we're seeing a clear trend in states taking action to cut down on nonmedical exemptions, with Washington, Maine, and New York all removing personal and/or religious belief exemptions for some or all vaccines this year alone. (They're the first states to take such action since [California](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB277) and [Vermont](https://legislature.vermont.gov/Documents/2016/Docs/ACTS/ACT037/ACT037%20Act%20Summary.pdf) did in 2015, according to [NCSL data](http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/school-immunization-exemption-state-laws.aspx).) A sign that this trend could continue: Earlier this year, then-FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., said the federal government might have to step in if states don't tighten up their nonmedical exemptions. \"Some states are engaging in such wide exemptions that they're creating the opportunity for outbreaks on a scale that is going to have national implications,\" Dr. Gottlieb told [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/20/health/vaccine-exemptions-fda-gottlieb/index.html) in February, adding that if \"certain states continue down the path that they're on, I think they're going to force the hand of the federal health agencies.\" California in particular provides a telling case study of this problem. In 2015 the state passed [Senate Bill No. 277 (SB-277)](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB277), which got rid of the personal belief exemption for existing immunization requirements. According to a [report from the California Department of Public Health](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Immunization/2017-2018KindergartenSummaryReport.pdf), SB-277 was successful in expanding vaccine coverage, with rates of vaccinated kindergarteners rising from 92.8 percent in 2015 to 2016 (when SB-277 was not yet in effect) to 95.6 percent in 2016 to 2017 (after SB-277 went into effect), then dipping slightly to 95.1 percent in 2017 to 2018. At the same time, the rate of medical exemptions more than tripled from 0.2 percent in 2015-2016 to 0.7 percent in 2017-2018. Evidence suggests some of these exemptions may not actually have been medically necessary. In a 2018 [Pediatrics](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/142/5/e20181051) study Omer coauthored, researchers interviewed 40 health officers and immunization staff throughout the state of California. They found that the conditions most often used as medical exemptions that these participants deemed \"suspicious\" were a family history of [allergies](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/allergies) and a family history of autoimmune disorders. (Technically the language of SB-277 does say that it is legally acceptable for a family medical history to be considered for a medical exemption, but as the study authors note the ACIP doesn't consider these to be medical contraindications.) Beyond that some interviewees reported seeing doctors advertise medical exemptions in exchange for a fee. Some also said they'd received medical exemptions from doctors who don't even usually see children, like cardiologists and medical marijuana dispensary doctors, along with medical staff who were unauthorized to write exemptions in those areas. We also have evidence that people do take advantage when there is a low bar for medical exemptions. A 2012 study in [The Journal of Infectious Diseases](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/206/7/989/806132) that Omer coauthored looked at whether the ease of getting a medical exemption appeared to have any bearing on the number of medical exemptions people got. For each of the 50 states, researchers systematically scored the difficulty of getting an exemption based on the presence or absence of six different administrative requirements (including things like needing a written physician's statement along with a medical exemption form and needing health department approval). The researchers ranked the states into three categories: easy ones in which to get a medical exemption (30 states), medium (17 states), or difficult (3 states). Then they looked at the actual medical exemption rates for each state at the kindergarten level in school years from 2004 to 2005 through 2010 to 2011. The researchers discovered that medical exemption rates were \"significantly higher\" in states with easy or medium requirements than in states with difficult requirements. If exemptions were being judiciously given across all the states based solely on medical criteria, you would expect the rates to be about equal. Researchers also ranked the ease of getting a nonmedical exemption (using a similar three-category system) to see if there was any relationship. They found that medical exemption rates were greater in states with medium or difficult criteria for nonmedical exemptions than in those with easy nonmedical exemption criteria. And the highest rates of medical exemptions were seen in states that had both difficult nonmedical exemption criteria and easy medical exemption criteria. The authors concluded that parents living in states where it's tougher to get a nonmedical exemption may seek out medical exemptions instead. What's at stake when medical exemptions are misused When kids who have no need for medical exemptions get them, the rate of vaccination coverage clearly goes down. In turn the number of unvaccinated children who are susceptible to disease goes up, increasing the ease of transmission and the risk of outbreaks, Dr. Orenstein explains. This is especially dangerous for anyone at the school who is [immune-compromised](https://www.self.com/story/rely-on-herd-immunity) and therefore particularly vulnerable to infections and unable to safely get vaccines that protect against those illnesses. \"There could be a child in the school with [cancer](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/cancer) who's on severe immunosuppressant medications...who cannot get vaccinated,\" Dr. Orenstein says. If an unvaccinated classmate is exposed to, say, measles, they could transmit it to that [vulnerable child](https://www.self.com/story/parent-child-who-cant-get-vaccines) who has little to no immune defense. This is why [herd immunity](https://www.self.com/story/rely-on-herd-immunity) is important\u2014the more people who get vaccinated, the more in the general \"herd\" of that community who are safe even if they can't get vaccinated themselves. Another thing people often aren't aware of is that maximum vaccination rates protect those who get vaccinated but are still at risk. \"No vaccine gives [100 percent immunity](https://www.self.com/story/flu-shot-effectiveness-explained),\" Dr. Orenstein explains. For instance, the recommended two doses of the MMR vaccine are around 97 percent effective at preventing measles, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccination.html), meaning that around 97 out of 100 people who get this vaccine and are exposed to measles won't actually get sick. This is a phenomenal win for public health. As for the three who would get measles after exposure, even their cases would likely be milder and transmitted less easily to other people, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html) explains. \"We don't know who those 3 percent are, but they are indirectly protected if they're not exposed by everyone else,\" Dr. Orenstein says. But when children without real contraindications or severe enough precautions for vaccination don't get vaccinated, that herd immunity is put in jeopardy. And of course the decision [not to vaccinate](https://www.self.com/story/from-anti-to-pro-vaccine) also affects the child who should be vaccinated but instead is left unprotected. \"[Parents] who opt out are making an active decision to increase not just the community risk but the individual risk of the child,\" Omer explains. \"It's not erring on the side of caution, it is making an active decision to increase their risk of getting the disease. Non-vaccination is not a benign decision.\" This story is part of a larger package called Vaccines Save Lives. You can find the rest of the "}
