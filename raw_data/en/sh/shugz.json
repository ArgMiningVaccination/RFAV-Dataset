Tests sponsored by the USDA indicate clinically significant nutrient deficiency in most Americans, particularly as they age. As a result, several medical bodies, including the American Medical Association, recommended that everyone take a daily multi-vitamin and/or mineral supplement. That's a minimum baseline for health. If you have specific conditions that need further attention, then additional supplementation may be needed. The question is, how do you know if you're taking the right supplements? And how do you measure the potency of what you're taking? First, insist on professional-grade products, such as those available through Acupuncture Plus.

Why Use Pro-Grade Nutritional Supplements? - Certain medications can deplete essential nutrients from your body. Pro-grade nutritional supplements can replenish missing vitamins and minerals to restore balance. - Because of the many toxins we're exposed to on a daily basis, our bodies require more antioxidants and nutritional supplementation to stay healthy. Pro-grade nutritional supplements ensure that you're getting the right dose of the right nutrient. - The effects of stress and disease can drain vitamins and minerals from your system. Pro-grade nutritional supplements can help restore the proper level of nutrients to reestablish health and improve your feeling of well-being. - Modern farming practices often yield foods with fewer nutrients, and processed foods typically have inferior vitamin and mineral content. Pro-grade nutritional supplements fill the gaps left by the foods you're consuming. - If your digestive system isn't working properly, your body may not be absorbing all the nutrients you eat. Pro-grade nutritional supplements, combined with dietary recommendations and other treatments, such as acupuncture, help your body function more efficiently and absorb nutrients more effectively. "}
