(10/14/81, Amended 6/20/91 and 5/10/2022) 07-02: COMPOUNDING 07-02-0001\u2014 STANDARDS FOR COMPOUNDING AND DISPENSING STERILE PRODUCTS The purpose of this rule is to provide standards in the conduct, practices, and operations of a pharmacy preparing and dispensing products requiring sterility, such as injectables, ophthalmics, and inhalants. Compounding a drug product that is commercially available in the market place or that is essentially a copy of a commercially available FDA -approved drug product is generally prohibited. However, in special circumstances a pharmacist may compound an appropriate quantity of a drug that is only slightly different than an FDA -approved drug that is commercially available based on documentation provided by the prescribing physician of a patient specific medical need (e.g. the physician requests an alternate product due to hypersensitivity to excipients or preservative in the FDA -approved product, or the physician requests an effective alternate dosage form) or if the drug product is not commercially available. The unavailability of such drug product must be documented prior to compounding. The recommended methodology for documenti ng unavailability is to print the screen of wholesalers showing back- ordered, discontinued, or out -of- stock items. This or similar documentation must be available when requested by the Board. Except for those products where stability prohibits advanced compounding, all products dispensed by the pharmacy shall be in a form ready for administration, except in health care facilities where medications may be provided as demanded by policies and procedures. Pharmacies and pharmacists dispensing sterile products shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local law and rule concerning pharmacy and also these additional rules: (a) Guidelines for preparation of sterile products will be based on the distinction of sterile products as either low -risk, medium -risk or high -risk products. (1) Sterile products compounded under all of the following conditions are considered low -risk sterile products: (A) The finished products are compounded with aseptic manipulations entirely within a Class 100 environment or better air quality using only sterile ingredients, products, components, and devices. (B) The compounding involves only transfer, measuring, and mixing manipulations with closed or sealed packaging systems that are performed promptly and attentively. (C) Manipulations ar e limited to aseptically opening ampule s, penetrating sterile stoppers on vials with sterile needles and syringes, and transferring sterile liquids in sterile syringes to sterile administration devices and packages of other sterile products. (D) For a low -risk preparation, in the absence of passing a sterility test, the storage periods shall not exceed the following time periods: before administration, the sterile products are exposed for no more than forty- eight (48) hours at controlled room temperature, fourt een (14) days at two (2) to eight (8) degrees centigrade, and forty- five (45) days in solid frozen state at negative twenty ( -20) degrees centigrade or colder, while properly stored. Rev. 12/2022 7-10 (2) When sterile products compounded aseptically under low -risk conditions, a nd one or more of the following conditions exists, such products are considered medium -risk sterile products: (A) Multiple individual or small doses of sterile products are combined or pooled to prepare a sterile product that will be administered either to mul tiple patients or to one patient on multiple occasions. (B) The compounding process includes complex aseptic manipulations other than the single - volume transfer (C) The compounding process requires unusually long duration, such as that required to complete the dis solution or homogeneous mixing. (D) The sterile products do not contain broad- spectrum bacteriostatic substances, and they are administered over several days. (E) For a medium -risk preparation, in the absence of passing a sterility test, the storage periods shall not exceed the following time periods: before administration, the sterile products are exposed for no more than thirty (30) hours at controlled room temperature, seven (7) days at two (2) to eight (8) degrees centigrade, and forty- five (45) days in solid frozen state at negative twenty ( -20) degrees centigrade or colder, while properly stored. (3) Sterile products compounded under any of the following conditions are considered high- risk sterile products: (A) Nonsterile ingredients are incorporated, or a nonster ile device is employed before terminal sterilization (B) Sterile ingredients, components, devices, and mixtures are exposed to air quality inferior to a Class 100 environment. This includes storage in environments inferior to a Class 100 environment of opened or partially used packages of manufactured sterile products that lack antimicrobial preservatives. (C) Nonsterile preparations are exposed no more than 6 hours before being sterilized. (D) It is assumed, and not verified by examination of labeling and documentati on from suppliers or by direct determination, that the chemical purity and content strength of ingredients meet their original or compendial specifications in unopened or in opened packages of bulk ingredients. (E) For a high- risk preparation, in the absence of passing a sterility test, the storage periods shall not exceed the following time periods: before administration, the sterile products are exposed for no more than twenty- four (24) hours at controlled room temperature, three (3) days at two (2) to eight (8) degrees centigrade, and forty- five (45) days in solid frozen state at negative twenty ( -20) degrees centigrade or colder, while properly stored. (b) Pharmacist requirements: Any pharmacist in charge who performs or supervises the preparation or st erilization of sterile medications shall: (1) Have available written policies and procedures for all steps in the compounding of sterile preparations.

(2) The controlled limited access area shall have a certified and inspected Class100 environment. Such an environment exists inside a certified laminar airflow hood (clean room, biological safety cabinet or other barrier isolator meeting Class 100 requi rements) used for the preparation of all sterile products. The Class 100 environment device or area is to be inspected and certified yearly. Barrier isolator workstations are closed systems and are not as sensitive to their external environment as laminar airflow equipment. It is recommended to place them in a limited access area with cleaning and sanitizing in the surrounding area on a routine basis. (3) Hazardous drugs shall be prepared within a certified Class 11, Type A (exhaust may be discharged to the outdoors) or Class 11, Type B (exhaust may be discharged to the outdoors) laminar flow biological safety cabinet. The Class 11, Type B can be obtained with a \"bag in-bag out\" filter to protect the personnel servicing the cabinet and facilitate disposal. Wh en preparing cytotoxic agents, gowns and gloves shall be worn. All new construction, and those undergoing renovation requiring the moving of existing hoods used in the preparation of cytotoxic drugs, shall exhaust the hood to the outdoors, unless the Board of Pharmacy grants an exception. The cabinet of choice is a Class 11, Type B. For the purpose of this rule , hazardous drugs shall be defined as agents that exhibit characteristics of genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, or evidence of serious or gan or other toxicity at low doses. (4) The area shall be designed to avoid excessive traffic and airflow disturbances. (5) The area shall be ventilated in a manner not interfering with laminar flow hood conditions.

(B) Sterility Testing (Bacterial and Fungal) - The USP Membrane Filtration Method is the method of choice where feasible (e.g. components are compatible with the membrane). The USP Direct Transfer Method is p referred when the membrane filtration is not feasible. An alternative method may be used if verification results demonstrate that the alternative is at least as effective and reliable as the USP Membrane Filtration Method or the USP Direct Transfer Method. The pharmacist in charge shall establish written procedures requiring daily observation of the media and requiring an immediate recall if there is any evidence of microbial growth and said procedures must be available to Board inspectors. (C) Bacterial Endotoxin (Pyrogen) Testing - The USP Bacterial Endotoxin Test, or verified equivalent, shall be used to ensure compounded sterile products do not contain excessive endotoxins. (D) Potency Testing - The potency of all compounded products meeting the criter ia described in Board rule 07-02-0001 (j) (5) above must be tested to verify the potency stated on the label. Products for which there is no known or commercially available potency test standard require Board approval prior to compounding. (E) The USP Membrane Filtration Method and the USP Direct Transfer Method are the membrane filtration and direct transfer methods described in Chapter 71,United States Pharmacopeia (\"USP\"), 2001 Edition. The USP Bacterial Endotoxin Test is the bacterial f iltration test described in Chapter 85, USP, 2001 Edition.

Dispensing, beyond the emergency period, must be pursuant to a written prescription signed by the prescribing individua l practitioner. For the purposes of authorizing an oral prescription for a controlled substance listed in Schedule II of the Arkansas Controlled Substance List, the term \"emergency situation\" means those situations in which the prescribing practitioner det ermines that: (1) Immediate administration of the controlled substance is necessary for proper treatment of the intended ultimate user; (2) No appropriate alternative treatment is available (which includes the administration of a drug which is not a Schedule II), and (3) It is not reasonably possible for the prescribing practitioner to provide a written prescription to be presented to the pharmacist dispensing the drug prior to the dispensing.

The pharmacist must record, on the prescription, whether the patient is \"terminally ill\" or an \"LTCF patient\". For each partial filling, the dispensing pharmacist shall record, on the back of the prescription (or on another appropriate record, uniformly maintained, and readily retrievable), the date of the partial filling, quantity dispensed, remaining quantity authorized to be dispensed, and the identification of the dispensing pharmacist.

(6/21/2001) Agency # 070.00 Rev. 5/2022 RULE 9 \u2014PHARMACEUTICAL CA RE/PATIENT COUNSELING 09-00: PATIENT COUNSELING 09-00-0001--PATIENT INFORMATION, DRUG USE EVALUATION, AND PATIENT COUNSELING The intent of this rule is to improve pharmaceutical care by defining basic standards of care. Pharmacy care/pharmaceutical ca re is defined as the responsib le provision of drug therapy for the purpose of achieving definite outcomes that improve a patient's quality of life. These outcomes are: (1) cure of diseas e, (2) elimination or reduction of a patient's symptomatology, (3) arresting or slowing a disease process, or (4) preventing a diseas e or symptomatology. Pharmaceutical care (clinical pharmacy) involv es four major functions on behalf of the patient: (1) identifying potential and actual drug -related problems, (2) resolving actual drug related problems, (3) pr eventing potential drug-related pr oblems, and (4) optimizing patient therapy outcomes. It is recognized that the patient might be best served if medication is not provided. (a) Patient inform ation (profile) In order to effectively counsel patients, th e pharmacist must, thro ugh communication with the patient or caregiver, make a reasonable effort to obtain, record, and maintain the following information for each patient. It is re cognized that most of this can be obtained using pharmacy technicians and designed forms, etc. (1) Name, address, telephone number; (2) Date of birth (age); (3) Gender; (4) Medical history (A) Significant patient health prob lems known to the pharmacist; (B) Prescription drug reactions/prescription drug allergies; (C) List of prescription medications and lege nd drug administration devices known to the pharmacist. (5) Transitory patients or situa tions where the pharm acy will only prov ide medication one time In obtaining patient information, if the pharmacist knows or is informed by the patient that this is a one-time situatio n, the pharmacist may forego the above requirement to record and maintain the information. (6) Pharmacist comments (b) Drug use evaluation for new and refill prescriptions Drug use evaluati on or drug utilizatio n review includes the following activities: (1) The pharmacist shall evaluate the prescription or medication order for: (A) Reasonable dose and rout e of administration; (B) Reasonable directions for use. (2) The pharmacist shall evaluate medication orders and patient information for: (A) Duplication of therapy - is the patient taking the same or similar me dication(s)?; (B) Prescription drug-prescription drug interactions; Rev. 5/2022 2 (C) Proper utilization (ove r or underutilization); (D) Known drug allergies. (3) Drug-drug contraindications as defined by the Board. (Is this medication contraindicated with another medication the patient is taking?) (4) It is recognized that the ultima te decision to use th e medication or not use the medication rests with the physician wh o has more complete patient information. It is the pharmacist's responsib ility to monitor the pa tient's medication th erapy in the areas addressed in this rule and inform the physician of the suspected problem. (5) If a problem is suspected and the physician is informed, th e pharmacist shall document the process. (c) Patient counseling: (1) A pharmacist shall counsel th e patient or caregiver \"face to face\" if the patient or caregiver is in the pharmacy. If not, a pha rmacist shall make a reasonable effort to counsel the patient or caregiver; (2) Alternative forms of patient information may be used to supplement, but not replace face-to-face patient counseling; (3) Patient counseling, as describe d herein, shall also be required for outpatients of hospitals and institutions when medicat ions are dispensed on disc harge from the hospital or institution. (4) Patient counseling as described in this rule shall not be required for inpatients of a hospital or institution where a nurse or ot her licensed health ca re professional is authorized to administer the medication. Ho wever, the pharmacist shall provide drug therapy counseling it is when professiona lly deemed to be ap propriate and when medications are provided by the pharmacy, and when a pharmacist is on duty and a patient is discharged from the hospital or institution. (5) The pharmacist shall maintain and make available to all patients appropriate patient- oriented reference materials USP-DI or Facts and Comparisons Patient Drug Facts or an equivalent or better publicat ion as determined by the Board. (6) It is recognized that the ultima te decision to not provide patie nt counseling rests with the physician. If the physician in specific instances (blanket requ ests not accepted) requests that information NOT be provided to the pa tient and gives reason, the pharmacist should honor that request in almost all instances. (d) \"Patient counseling\" shall mean the effective communica tion by the pharmacist of information, as defined in this act to the patient or caregiver, in order to improve therapeutic outcome by encouraging proper use of prescrip tion medications and drug delivery devices. (1) For original prescription medication orders, (excluding renewed or updated prescriptions the patient has been recently taking) and or ders for legend devices, specific areas of counseling shall include: (A) Name and general description of the me dication dispensed, i.e. antibiotic, antihistamine, blood pressure medicine, etc. (B) Name, general description and directions for use of drug delivery devices, i.e., insulin syringes, mo rphine pump, etc. Rev. 5/2022 3 (C) Explanation of route of administration, dosage, times of administration, and continuity of therapy; (D) Special directions for storage as de emed necessary by the pharmacist; (E) If the drug has been determin ed to have a significant side effect by the Board of Pharmacy, the patient shall be properly counseled to the extent deemed necessary by the pharmacist. (F) When the prescription drug dispensed has a significant side effect, if taken with over-the-counter drugs, the pharmacist should counsel the patient about that interaction. (Example: coumadin with aspirin ) (G) If the prescription medication is significantly affected by food or diet, the pharmacist should so advise the patient. (Examp le: tetracycline wi th milk or food) (H) The pharmacist shall inform the patient or caregiver that he/she is available to answer questions about medications or general health information. (2) Refills--On refills the pharm acist shall present the oppor tunity for the patient or caregiver to ask questi ons. However, counseling on refills is not require d except when needed in the professional judgment of the pharmacist. (d) Drug interactions - significant side effects Recognizing that a pharmacist ca nnot be expected to recognize all possible drug interactions and also recognizing that the pharmacist and the patient do not have time to explain the numerous side effects of drugs, the pharmacy shall maintain a computer program which will identify significant drug interactions. (These are drugs with side effects which may be managed most effectively if the patient is aware of the specific side effect and what to do if it occurs.) The pharmacist in charge will be responsible for assuring that the computer system adequately flags and wa rns the pharmacist of any occurrence of significant drug interactions or significant si de effects. (If a pharmacy was in business before September 1, 1997, and at that time , did not have a comp uter system, said ph armacy may substitute Patient Drug Facts or other drug interaction manuals to reference drug interactions and side effects for effective patient co unseling. This method should only be used until such time as the pharmacy acquires an ad equate computer program as described in th is section.) The pharmacist will be responsible for counse ling the patient on thes e interactions with verbal and, where appropriate, written info rmation.
