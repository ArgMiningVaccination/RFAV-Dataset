Traditional Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has developed over a period of at least 3,000 years. It is a holistic medicine which takes into account all of the systems of the body and how they interact with one another as well as external environmental factors. Ideally, the systems and organs function together to maintain homeostasis (a healthy balance) in the body. This interconnectedness is why a TCM practitioner can almost never treat one part, or system, without affecting the whole. Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners see disease as a result of the disruption of the harmonious balance of these systems. TCM practitioners utilize a combination of therapies including [acupuncture, herbal medicine, cupping, gua sha, massage, diet modifications](http://www.obtainbetterbalance.com/services/) and exercises. Treatments are individualized for the patient depending on their unique manifestation of a disease. MEET OUR PRACTITIONERS: Kirsten Malmendier, L.Ac. Founder & owner of Better Balance Acupuncture + Wellness L.Ac. (Licensed Acupuncturist in the state of California) FABORM (Fellow of the American Board of Reproductive Medicine) MSTCM (Masters in Science in Traditional Chinese Medicine, South Baylo University, CA) NCCAOM (National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine) Balance Method practitioner From a very young age, I knew that I wanted to pursue a career in health that was both rewarding to myself and provided value to those that I served. I have many childhood memories of my father sharing stories of the patients he helped in his chiropractic practice as we sat around the dinner table. The joy he received from helping his patients was truly contagious! I began working in my father's chiropractic office as a teenager and was even more inspired by the change I witnessed in his patients on a daily basis. Observing my father in his practice taught me the importance of helping people get well with a natural and holistic approach. At age 16 I had my first glimpse into the world of Chinese Medicine and suddenly everything seemed to fall into place. I knew that a career in Chinese Medicine was the perfect opportunity for me to provide something great to those who really needed it. I decided to follow my dreams and completed my Masters of Science in Oriental Medicine from Southern California's South Baylo University. I was very fortunate to study under world-renowned Acupuncturists and Medical doctors. What I found in my studies was truly life changing. Through extensive clinical training, I was taught to spend the time necessary with patients to really understand their condition and set of issues, and learned how to use ancient but effective techniques to ease pain, manage and even eliminate emotional issues, and treat many internal disorders. I have found that patients respond extremely well to this kind of clinical setting; especially those who have tried many other treatment methods but have not had successful outcomes. It is my passion to treat virtually all conditions related to pain, various digestive issues, women's health and fertility (for both men and women), anxiety and sleep disorders. I am committed to educating and empowering my patients on how to take control of their health and live a more balanced lifestyle in this busy western world we live in. I truly have a love and passion for this medicine and hope to share it with anyone who crosses my path! In late 2020, I relocated to Boise, ID with my husband and family. Though I no longer work in the Sacramento area, I am very proud of each and every practitioner that comprises our team at Better Balance. I consider them to be some of the best, most well-trained practitioners in our area. Thankfully they have graciously taken over my patient base and done an incredible job doing so. I am still here, behind the scenes to help you in any way I can. Spring 2023 Update: I am now seeing patients in Eagle, ID.

NCCAOM (National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine) MTCM (Masters of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Five Branches University) DACM (Doctorate of Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine with specialization in women's health and fertility) Balance Method Acupuncture Practitioner Master Tung Acupuncture Practitioner Chi Nei Tsang (Abdominal Massage) Practitioner Microneedling Certified Medical Qi Gong Certified Practitioner (Five Branches University) Licensed Esthetician Dr. Mimi Le had always known she wanted to be a healer ever since she was a young, but was unsure which health field she should pursue in. She went to college and majored in pre-nursing thinking that perhaps Nursing would be her calling only to realize it wasn't the type of lifestyle she can handle. She then went into her second passion which was to specialize in skincare and dermatology and became a licensed esthetician to help people look and feel beautiful. As an esthetician she was taught facial diagnosis which stem from Chinese Medicine and was amazed at the amount of information she can learn about her patient's health with just a glance. It was at that moment that she realized that she needed to study Traditional Chinese Medicine since she believed it to be a highly beneficial holistic health field to be in. Dr. Mimi graduated with her Masters and Doctorates from Five Branches University and decided to specialize in women's health and fertility. She had the opportunity to complete her externship at the renowned China Medical University Hospital in Taichung, Taiwan by shadowing various acupuncturists in a hospital setting that incorporates both eastern and western approach to medicine in different fields of practice from gynecology to pediatric medicine. After graduating from Five Branches University, she was scouted by her mentors to work in their fertility acupuncture practice that has connections with multiple IVF centers in the Bay Area for over 4 years before making a life changing move to Sacramento. She feels blessed to join a team of like minded acupuncturists at Better Balance Acupuncture and hopes she can make positive changes to everyone that she meets. Specialized in different acupuncture techniques, Dr. Mimi strives to use her knowledge and skills to help patients improve their health using herbs and acupuncture. In addition to specializing in women's health and fertility, Dr. Mimi is also experienced in facial rejuvenation (microneedling), Chi Nei Tsang, dermatological issues and chronic pain. In her free time she practices archery, has a knack for learning new languages, trying new food, hiking and traveling. Karen Holt, L.Ac. L.Ac. (Licensed Acupuncturist in the state of California).
