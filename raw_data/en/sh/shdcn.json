Here we found that SSd alleviated remarkably carbon 23 tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis, as evidenced by decreased collagen level 24 and profibrotic markers (COl1a1 and -smooth muscle actin (SMA)) expression. repressed NOD-like receptor family pyrin-domain-containng-3 26 (NLRP3) activation in fibrotic livers, as suggested by decreased level of NLRP3, 27 IL-18, and IL-. The primary HSCs of CCl4 mice exhibited a significant increase in 28 profibrotic markers expression and NLRP3 activation, but SSd treatment reversed the 29 effect. SSd also repressed TGF--induced profibrotic markers expression and NLRP3 30 activation in vitro. Mechanistically, TGF- decreased the expression of Estrogen 31 receptor- (ER) in HSCs, whereas SSd treatment reversed the effect. ER inhibition 32 enhanced NLRP3 activation in HSCs. More important, ER or NLRP3 inhibition 33 destroyed partially the function of SSd on anti-liver fibrosis. In summary, the current 34 data suggest that SSd prevents hepatic fibrosis through regulating ER/NLRP3 35 inflammasome pathway, and suggest SSd as a potential agent for treating liver Keywords: Liver Author(s) or their Institution(s)Biochemistry and Cell BiologyDraft 3 / 2338 receptor-, Hepatic stellate cells. 39 40 Introduction 41 Liver fibrosis is the common pathological basis of various chronic liver diseases, and 42 is a reversible scar healing response caused by repeated liver injury. Hepatic stellate 43 cells (HSCs) plays an important role in hepatic fibrosis formation in response to 44 profibrogenic mediators (Friedman 2008). Under physiological conditions, resting 45 HSCs are essential for retinoid homeostasis and extracellular matrix (ECM) 46 remodeling. Once HSCs is activated, resting HSCs is transformed into myofibroblast 47 with ECM overexpression (Schuppan and Kim 2013). Nevertheless, there are no drug 48 candidates specifically targeting HSCs, which limits current anti-fibrotic therapies 49 (Poelstra 2016). 50 Saikosaponins D (SSd) is saponin derivative with glucocorticoid-like steroid ring 51 structure isolated and extracted from traditional Chinese medicine Bupleurum (Wang 52 et al. 2015). Previous studies have shown that SSd possesses many biological effects, 53 such as anti-inflammation, anti- convulsion, and anti-cell proliferation (Cheng et al. 54 2006; Zhu et al. 2011). The protective effect of SSd on liver injury was also verified 55 in CCl4-induced liver injury model (Abe et al. 1982). Nevertheless, the underlying 56 mechanism of SSd in treating liver fibrosis has not been fully elucidated. 57 Inflammasome is a multi-protein cytoplasmic complexes and plays an important role Page 3 of 30 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Biochemistry and Cell BiologyDraft 4 / 2358 in innate immunity by facilitating the production of pro-inflammatory factors (Tao et 59 al. 2020). NLRP3 inflammasome is the most thoroughly studied member among all 60 inflammasomes (Lim et al. 2018). The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is 61 associated with sterile inflammation induced by environmental stress and mechanical 62 trauma (Kapetanovic et al. 2015). Given the close correlation of sterile inflammation 63 with tissue fibrosis (Kubes and Mehal 2012), aberrant activation of NLRP3 64 inflammasome may be correlated with liver fibrosis to a great extent. NLRP3 65 inflammasome promotes the activation of pro-caspase-1, which cleaves pro-interleukin and pro-IL-18 into mature and These 67 could activate primary Kupffer cells (KCs), which mediates the activation of HSCs 68 and promotes hepatic fibrosis (Petrasek et al. 2012). Recent evidence showed that SSd 69 attenuates ventilator-induced lung damage by suppressing inflammatory response and 70 oxidative stress (Wang et al. 2015). However, the therapeutic effects of SSd on 71 hepatic fibrosis through regulating NLRP3 inflammasome remain unclear. 72 Here, we explored the role of SSd in regulating CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis and its 73 underlying mechanism. We assessed the correlation of SSd with NLRP3 74 inflammasome in HSCs in vivo and in vitro. The present study demonstrate that SSd 75 alleviates liver fibrosis through regulating Estrogen receptor- /NLRP3 inflammasome 76 pathway. 77 78 Materials and methodsPage 4 of 30 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Cell BiologyDraft 5 / 2379 CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis mice 80 All animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai 81 Municipal Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai University of 82 Traditional Chinese Medicine. Male C57BL/6J mice (25-30g, 6-8 weeks, n=5 of each 83 group) were obtained from Shanghai Slack Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, 84 China). CCl4 and vehicle (olive oil) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical 85 Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and Solarbio (Beijing, China), respectively. All 86 mice were randomly divided into three groups: control group, CCl4 group and 87 CCl4+SSd group. The control mice were injected with commensurable olive oil twice 88 a week for six weeks. The mice of CCl4 group and CCl4+SSd group were 89 intraperitoneal injected CCl4 (0.8ml/kg) twice a week for 6 weeks. At the same time, 90 CCl4+SSd group mice were intraperitoneally administered SSd (Wako Pure Chemical 91 Industries, Ltd, Japan) daily at a dosage of 2.0 mg/kg for 6 weeks. Mice were 92 anesthetized and sacrificed after treatment with vehicle, CCl4, or SSd for 6 weeks. 93 Liver tissues was used to subsequent assessment. 94 Primary mouse HSCs isolation and LX-2 cells culture 95 Primary HSCs were extracted from liver tissues of C57BL/6 mice following the 96 previous reports (Zhang et al. 2020). Briefly, the abdominal cavity was opened, and 97 the portal vein of the catheter was punctured and perfused, which was digested by 1 98 IV (Vetec, V900893) and 2 mg/ml pronase destroy Page 5 of 30 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Biochemistry and Cell BiologyDraft 6 / 2399 the liver structure. Then gradient centrifugation was performed by Nycodenz, so that 100 HSCs were stratified in the centrifuge tube, thereby separating HSCs. HSCs were 101 immediately treated for qPCR or western blot analysis after isolation. 102 Human Hepatic Stellate Cells LX-2, purchased from Merck Millipore (SCC064, 103 Temecula, California, USA), were kept in with 2% FBS and 1% 37 the humidified 5% CO 2 105 environment. LX-2 cells were treated with 5 ng/ml TGF- (Beyotime, Shanghai, 106 China) for 24 h. 107 Histological evaluation 108 The liver tissues was rinsed with PBS and placed in 4% buffered formaldehyde for 109 one day. Paraffin-embedded tissue was cut into 5 \u00b5m sections with a cryostat (Leica, 110 Solms, Germany). The sections were subjected to Masson's staining (Ishak et al. 111 1995) or Sirius red to assess liver IL-1 (SEKH-0002) and IL-18 (SEKM-0019) levels were assessed using the 114 indicated ELISA Kit (Solarbio, Beijing, China). The serum from CCl4-induced mice 115 was processed as the manufacturer's protocol. 116 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 117 The liver tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and cut Page 6 of 30 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Biochemistry and Cell BiologyDraft 7 / 23118 into 4 \u00b5m-thick sections. The slices were incubated with citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 5 119 min at 108 \u00b0C, pretreated with 3% hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) for 15 min at room 120 temperature and washed with PBS. Then, the slices were incubated with normal goat 121 serum for 20 min, followed by incubation with primary 4 \u00b0C. Then the slices were incubated with 124 secondary antibody and the reaction was visualized with DAB solution. 125 Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) 126 Total RNA was isolated by Trizol reagent (Solarbio) as the manufacturer's 127 instructions. Reverse transcriptional PCR was carried out with the iScripe cDNA 128 Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). qPCR reaction was performed using an ABI 7500-Fast 129 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA) using 130 LightCycler 480 SYBR Mix (Roche). The fold changes were calculated with the 131 2-Ct method and GAPDH served as a normalizing control. All primer sequences for 132 qPCR were listed in Table 1. 133 Western Blot analysis 134 The LX-2 cells or liver tissues were lysed by RIPA Buffer (TaKaRa, Japan), and the 135 total protein content was isolated and quantified with BCA protein assay kit 136 (TaKaRa). 30 g of total proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and then 137 transferred to PVDF membranes (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). After blocking with 5% Page 7 of 30 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Biochemistry and Cell BiologyDraft 8 / 23138 nonfat milk in TBST, the membranes were incubated with antibodies incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit (1:5000) 144 for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then visualized with ECL (Pierce, 145 Rockford, IL, USA). The intensity of bands was quantified by software ImageJ. 146 Statistical analysis 147 All data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM of at least three independent experiments. All 148 statistics were carried out by oneway ANOVA (SPSS 19.0 statistical software, IBM, 149 Armonk, NY, USA). P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. 150 151 Results 152 SSd ameliorated CCl4-induced liver fibrosis 153 Our previous studies have demonstrated that SSd contributes to repress oxidative 154 stress-induced HSCs activation (Que et al. 2018), and SSd also ameliorates 155 CCl4-induced hepatocyte damage (Lin et al. 2018). Here, we further explored the role 156 of SSd in regulating liver fibrosis and its underlying mechanism. The mouse model of Page 8 of 30 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Biochemistry and Cell BiologyDraft 9 / 23157 liver fibrosis was established via injecting intraperitoneally CCl4, at the same time 158 SSd were intraperitoneally administered. The results from Masson and Sirius red 159 staining showed that the collagen level was augmented remarkably in liver tissues of 160 CCl4 mice compared with control mice (Figure 1A and B). Immunohistochemical 161 (IHC) analysis also revealed that the level of profibrotic markers (Col11 and -SMA) 162 in liver tissues of CCl4 mice was increased markedly compared with control livers 163 (Figure 1C and D). Importantly, SSd treatment ameliorated effectively CCl4-induced 164 liver fibrosis. As shown in Figure 1, CCl4 injection upregulated the collagen level and 165 profibrotic markers expression, whereas simultaneous SSd treatment reversed the 166 process. However, SSd treatment for 3 weeks after 6 weeks of CCl4 treatment cannot 167 attenuate liver fibrosis (Supporting Figure S1). 168 SSd repressed CCl4-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation 169 Given the critical role of NLRP3 inflammasome in liver fibrosis (Supporting Figure 170 S2)(Mridha et al. 2017) and the correlation of SSd with NLRP3 inflammasome in 171 hepatocyte damage (Lin et al. 2018), we next explored whether SSd suppressed 172 CCl4-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation during liver fibrosis. As shown in 173 Figure 2A, the mRNA level of NLRP3 was increased markedly in CCl4-induced 174 fibrotic livers, whereas SSd treatment effectively inhibited CCl4-induced upregulation 175 of NLRP3. IHC analysis further demonstrated that SSd repressed markedly 176 CCl4-induced increase of hepatic NLRP3 expression (Figure 2B and C). Furthermore, 177 SSd repressed significantly CCl4-induced activation of hepatic NLRP3 Page 9 of 30 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Biochemistry and Cell BiologyDraft 10 / 23178 inflammasome, as evidenced by a decreased mRNA expression of IL-1 and IL-18 179 (Figure 2D). There was also a marked increase in circulating IL-1 and IL-18 in CCl4 180 mice compared to control mice, but SSd blocked this increase (Figure 2E). Figure 2F 181 showed that SSd decreased CCl4-induced NLRP3 expression and NLRP3 mainly 182 expressed in HSCs in fibrotic liver tissues. 183 SSd inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation of HSCs in vivo 184 HSCs activation is a key event in the occurrence and development of hepatic fibrosis, 185 we thus explored whether SSd repressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation in HSCs. 186 To this end, the primary HSCs were obtained from liver tissues of control mice, CCl4 187 mice, and SSd-treated CCl4 mice, respectively. Figure 3A showed that the HSCs of 188 CCl4 mice exhibited substantial increases in Col11 and -SMA compared to the 189 HSCs of control mice, but SSd repressed CCl4-induced increase of Col11 and 190 -SMA. The HSCs of CCl4 mice also exhibited significant increases in NLRP3, 191 IL-18, and IL-1, whereas SSd treatment repressed CCl4-induced expression of these 192 genes (Figure 3B). Similar to the qPCR results, western blot analysis also showed that 193 the HSCs of CCl4 mice exhibited the increased protein level of NLRP3, activated 194 Caspase-1, IL-18 and IL-1 (Figure 3C and D). SSd treatment repressed the 195 expression of these proteins in HSCs (Figure 3C and D). 196 SSd repressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation of HSCs in vitro 197 To further explore the effect of SSd in regulating NLRP3 inflammasome activation in Page 10 of 30 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Biochemistry and Cell BiologyDraft 11 / 23198 HSCs, LX-2 cells were treated with TGF- in the presence or absence of SSd, and 199 then profibrotic markers and NLRP3 activation were assessed using qPCR and 200 western blot analysis. Figure 4A and B showed that the level of Col11, -SMA and 201 NLRP3 was upregulated markedly in LX-2 cells after TGF- treatment, but SSd 202 repressed TGF--induced increase of Col11, -SMA and NLRP3. The results from 203 western blot analysis showed that the protein level of NLRP3, Col11, -SMA and 204 activated-caspase-1 was upregulated significantly in LX-2 cells after TGF- 205 treatment, but SSd repressed the process (Figure 4C and D). 206 MCC950 is a specific and potent NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor, which 207 NLRP3 inflammasomes formation caspase-1 activation ( Tang et al. 208 2020; Wang et al. 2020). To further explore the role of NLRP3 in hepatic fibrosis, 209 LX-2 cells were treated with TGF- in the presence or absence of MCC950, and then 210 NLRP3 activation and profibrotic markers expression were assessed. As shown in 211 Figure 5A, MCC950 repressed markedly TGF--induced NLRP3 activation. As 212 expected, MCC950 further repressed TGF--induced level of Col11 and -SMA 213 (Figure 5B-D). These results suggest that SSd repressed HSCs activation by 214 regulating NLRP3 expression and activation in vivo and in vitro. 215 SSd ameliorated liver fibrosis by regulating estrogen receptor (ER) /NLRP3 216 pathway 217 Our previous study has demonstrated that ER is a potential target of SSd in HSC-T6 Page 11 of 30 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Biochemistry and Cell BiologyDraft 12 / 23218 (Que et al. 2018). SSd represses oxidative stress-induced HSCs activation by 219 regulating ER (Que et al. 2018). Recent studies showed that Estrogen regulates the 220 activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in ER/-dependent manner (Liu et al. 2019a; 221 Wei et al. 2015). Thus, we next investigated whether SSd ameliorates liver fibrosis by 222 regulating ER-mediated NLRP3 activation. As shown in Figure 6A and B, the 223 mRNA and protein levels of ER and ER was decreased markedly in LX-2 cells 224 after TGF- treatment, whereas SSd restored ER expression. There was no 225 significant change in ER expression before and after SSd treatment (Figure 6A and 226 B). The HSCs of CCl4 mice exhibited a significant decreases in ER protein 227 expression compared with control, but SSd restored ER expression in HSCs (Figure 228 6C). Importantly, THC, an ER-selective antagonist, partially prevented the role of 229 SSd in repressing NLRP3 expression in HSCs and subsequent NLRP3 activation by 230 assessing IL-18 and IL-1 level (Figure 6D). Furthermore, although SSd repressed 231 TGF--induced expression of IL-18 and IL-1, ER inhibition by THC partially 232 prevented the function of SSd (Figure 6E and F). These data indicate that SSd 233 ameliorates CCl4-induced liver fibrosis, at least in part by regulating ER/NLRP3 234 pathway. 235 236 Discussion 237 Liver fibrosis is a chronic inflammation-related disease that includes infiltration of Page 12 of 30 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Biochemistry and Cell BiologyDraft 13 / 23238 inflammatory cells and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Inactivation of 239 HSCs is an effective means to prevent and treat liver fibrosis. Although a previous 240 study has demonstrated that SSd inhibits CCl4-induced liver fibrosis in rats (Dang et 241 al. 2007), the correlation of SSd with HSCs activation and the underlying mechanism 242 remains unknown. In this study, we found that 1) SSd ameliorated CCl4-induced liver 243 fibrosis; and activation; 3) SSd 244 inhibited NLRP3 expression and activation of HSCs in vivo and in vitro; 4) SSd 245 ameliorated liver fibrosis by regulating ER/NLRP3 pathway. The current data verify 246 the role of SSd in repressing liver fibrosis by regulating ER/NLRP3 inflammasome 247 pathway, and might be used as potential agent to treat liver fibrosis. 248 NLRP3 inflammasome can regulate the process of liver fibrosis through direct or 249 indirect effects. Its direct regulation promotes the development of liver fibrosis 250 through the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome in HSCs (Ouyang et al. 2013). 251 Studies have found that classical inflammasome-inducing activators such as uric acid 252 crystallization can activate mouse primary HSCs and human hepatic line 253 crystallization upregulates TGF- expression to induce HSCs 254 activation and the production of ECM such as collagen, while when knocking down 255 the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC)gene in HSCs, 256 the overproduction of ECM is significantly improved (Watanabe et al. 2009). NLRP3 257 inflammasome indirectly regulates the process of liver fibrosis by inducing hepatic 258 macrophages to secrete IL-1 and IL-18, which in turn promotes HSCs activation. Page 13 of 30 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Biochemistry and Cell BiologyDraft 14 / 23259 Both intestinal-derived molecular activate hepatic macrophage activation to promote liver fibrosis (Weiskirchen and Tacke 2014). 262 In the mouse model of hepatic fibrosis, the level of IL-1was significantly increased, 263 and the reduction of the expression of IL-1 receptor could significantly inhibit the 264 occurrence of fibrosis (Gieling et al. 2009). Furthermore, blocking IL-1 signaling 265 can inhibit the development of CCl4-induced and thioacetamide-induced hepatic 266 fibrosis, and knocking down the expression of NLRP3 or ASC can significantly 267 reduce the expression of TGF- and type 1 collagen (Olteanu et al. 2014). Other 268 studies have also demonstrated that Caspase-1 plays a crucial role in high-fat-induced 269 liver fibrosis (Snouwaert et al. 2016). These reports indicated that NLRP3 270 inflammasome is participated in the development of hepatic fibrosis. Our previous 271 studies revealed that SSd treatment represses NLRP3 inflammasome activation and 272 thus attenuates CCl4-induced acute liver injury in mice (Chen et al. 2020; Lin et al. 273 2018). However, the role of SSd in regulating NLRP3 inflammasome during HSCs 274 activation and liver fibrosis remains unclear. In the present study we explored whether 275 SSd represses HSCs activation by regulating NLRP3 inflammasome in vitro. CCl4-induced upregulation of NLRP3, IL-1 LX-2 MCC950 represses markedly TGF--induced the 278 activation of NLRP3 and the expression of Col11 and -SMA, indicating that SSd 279 treatment represses HSCs activation by regulating NLRP3 inflammasome in vivo and Page 14 of 30 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Biochemistry and Cell BiologyDraft 15 / 23280 in vitro. 281 Previous studies have shown that ER, not ER, expresses in rat primary HSCs, and 282 E2 can inhibit the proliferation and transformation of HSCs by the mediation of ER 283 (Zhou et al. 2001). Our previous studies also showed that ER and ER is decreased 284 markedly in LX-2 cells after TGF- treatment, whereas SSd restores ER expression 285 and do not change ER expression (Que et al. 2018). There were multiple ER 286 binding sites in the promoter region of NLRP3, suggesting that E2 may regulate the 287 function of NLRP3 inflammasome through ER (Liu et al. 2019b). Wei et al ., 288 reported that E2 suppresses the malignant behavior of cells via E2/ER/MAPK 289 pathway-mediated activation of NLRP3 inflammasome (Wei et al. 2015). However, 290 little is known about whether SSd regulates ER-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome 291 activation in HSCs. In the study we found that SSd represses HSCs activation and 292 ameliorates liver fibrosis by ER-mediated NLRP3 activation. Our revealed that THC, destroys SSd-induced indicating that SSd ameliorates liver fibrosis, at least in 295 part by regulating ER/NLRP3 pathway. 296 297 Acknowledgements 298 Not applicable. 299 Competing interestsPage 15 of 30 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Biochemistry and Cell BiologyDraft 16 / 23300 The authors declared no conflicts of interest. 301 Availability of data and materials 302 The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the 303 corresponding author on reasonable request. 304 Authors' contributions 305 All authors made a significant contribution to the work reported, drafted and written 306 the article, reviewed and agreed on all versions of the article in the whole process and 307 agree to take responsibility and be accountable for the contents of the article. 308 Funding 309 This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant 310 No. 81573775, 81873157, 81904157).
