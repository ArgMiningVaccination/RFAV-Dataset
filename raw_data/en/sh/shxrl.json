They contain high levels of mercury. Limit your intake of tuna to 2 steaks or 4 medium size cans a week 4 Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy CareCaffeine You do not need to cut out caffeine completely, but you should limit your intake to no more than 200mg a day. Please see caffeine levels below: one mug of instant coffee: 100mg. one mug of filter coffee: 140mg. one mug of tea: 75mg. one can of cola: 40mg. one can of energy drink: 80mg. one 50 g bar of plain (dark) chocolate: < 25mg. one 50 g bar of milk chocolate: < 10mg. Folic acid Folic acid helps to prevent developmental problems in the baby in the first 12 weeks of your pregnancy e.g. spina bifida. You are advised to take folic acid either when you plan to become pregnant, or as soon as you discover you are pregnant. The recommended dose is 400mcg daily. Vitamin D Vitamin D is recommended for all pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers as it helps strengthen your bones. The dose advised is 10mcg daily or 25mcg if your BMI exceeds 30. Alcohol There is no evidence showing what a safe level of alcohol is in pregnancy. We therefore recommend you avoid all alcohol whilst pregnant. Excessive alcohol intake during pregnancy may lead to miscarriage, or 'fetal alcohol syndrome' resulting in severe abnormalities. Drugs Non medicinal drugs during pregnancy can seriously harm you and your baby. Please check any over the counter or prescribed drugs with your pharmacist. If you do require advice or support, speak to your midwife at the earliest opportunity.Smoking During your booking appointment, you will be asked to take a Carbon Monoxide reading. If your reading is high, you will be offered a referral to smoking cessation services. Protecting your baby from smoke and more than 4000 chemicals that each cigarette contains is the best thing you can do for your baby. It's never too late to stop. When you stop smoking, you: will reduce the risk of complications during pregnancy and birth. are more likely to have a healthier pregnancy and baby. will reduce the risk of a stillbirth. will reduce the risk of giving birth too early, your baby needing extra breathing support after birth and being underweight because of altered nutrition supply. will reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (cot death) after your baby is born. For support, speak to your midwife who will refer you to our smoking cessation team. Find your nearest NHS Stop Smoking Service from the NHS Smoke free website or call 0300 123 1044 to speak to a trained adviser. Flu and whooping cough vaccinations We recommend that you have both of the above vaccinations during your pregnancy to protect you and your baby. Flu vaccination can be given at any time of your pregnancy during the flu season. This can be arranged through your midwife or GP . Whooping cough vaccination is advised at any time after 20 weeks gestation. Please enquire about our 'drop-in' services to receive this. Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy Care 5Exercise It is important to be active during your pregnancy. It is recommended that you continue to exercise at a level you are comfortable at and to a degree your body is used to doing. Exercises such as walking, swimming, yoga, pilates or aquanatal classes are safe and beneficial. It is recommended that you do moderate exercise of up to 30 minutes 3 - 4 times a week. Any activity which causes significant discomfort should be avoided. Exercising tips: Drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration. Work to your own level and avoid getting too hot or breathless. Stop immediately if you feel unwell. If you were running prior to pregnancy, it is fine to continue, however as your baby develops you may need to work at a lower intensity. Always advise fitness and gym instructors that you are pregnant, so they can provide alternative exercises for you and advise how to use machines appropriately. Competitive or contact sports should be avoided. Sports which involve high altitude or low depth are generally not suitable for pregnant women. Avoid exercise which involves engaging your core muscles from 12 weeks of pregnancy. Minor complaints Leg cramps can be common in pregnancy due to the changes in your body chemistry and changing pressures in the abdomen. Some women find the following help relieve symptoms: Ankle circles 10 times each way. Calf stretches. Heat and massage to the calf muscles. Swollen ankles and feet often occur in pregnancy due to extra fluid in the body. This can be more noticeable at the end of the day when extra fluid gathers in the lowest parts of the body, especially when the weather is hot, or you have been standing. Gradual swelling is not harmful to you or your baby, but it can be uncomfortable. The following can help reduce the swelling: Briskly moving your feet up and down for 30 seconds every hour. Sleep lying on your side with your legs slightly elevated. Avoid standing for long periods of time. Consider support tights. If swollen ankles and / or fingers are accompanied by a puffy face, headaches and / or flashing lights, please contact maternity triage immediately. The extra fluid can also lead to numb fingers and hands, which increases pressure at the wrist. This may occur in the morning and evening. Some helpful tips include: Wrist support to be worn at night. Sleeping with the arm slightly elevated. Cool water or ice therapy. Gentle range of movement exercises. 6 Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy CareMovements for circulation and relaxationRelationships Some women find pregnancy to be a time of increased stress and physical discomfort. It can greatly affect your financial state, your body image and relationship with others. Sex is safe unless you are advised otherwise. If you feel anxious or worried about anything, you can discuss your problems in confidence with your midwife. Domestic violence One in four women experience domestic abuse at some point in their lives, with many cases starting or worsening during pregnancy or after birth. It can take many forms, including physical, sexual, financial or emotional abuse. You can speak in confidence with your midwife who can offer help and support. You may prefer to contact a support agency such as the DV hub on 0208 547 6046. Please don't hesitate to ask for support as early as possible. You will not be judged and we will put you in contact with organisations that can help. BMI Your body mass index will be taken at your first antenatal appointment by your midwife. During pregnancy there are increased risks of complication if your BMI is less than 18 or more than 30. If you fall into either of these categories, you will be referred to our dietician team. Work and benefits You are entitled to take time off work for any appointment you need throughout your pregnancy. Your midwife will supply you with a maternity certificate (Mat B1) any time from 20 weeks of pregnancy to claim your entitlement. Visit https://www.gov.uk/maternity- pay-leave/overview and consult your employment contract for information on any maternity benefits you are eligible for.Pelvic floor The pelvic floor is made up of layers of muscle stretching from the pubic bone at the front of the pelvis to the bottom of the backbone, like a hammock. It helps hold the bladder, uterus and bowel in place and closes the outlets of the bladder and the back passage, preventing leakage of urine and faeces. Pregnancy and childbirth can cause weakness in the muscles, reducing their ability to give support. By exercising your pelvic floor during pregnancy and after birth, you can reduce these risks by up to 40%.

Second trimester patient information (13 - 29 weeks)Complications in pregnancy It is Important to be aware that some symptoms of pregnancy might suggest complications. Please contact your midwife or maternity unit if any of these occur: Vaginal bleeding: If you experience any bleeding, you will be asked to go into hospital for necessary tests and assessments. A personal plan will be made by health care professionals. Abdominal pain. Waters breaking: Spontaneous rupture of membranes (SROM) is followed by a 'gush', leak or trickle of amniotic fluid. You are advised to contact your maternity triage on 0208 934 2802. Reduced fetal movement: see further information later on in this section. Concerns of a water / urine infection. Possible thrush. Any other concerns or changes that worry you. Other conditions which may occur during pregnancy High blood pressure Your blood pressure will be checked by your midwife at every appointment. If your blood pressure is found to be high you will be referred to the maternity unit for assessment and a care plan. If you experience severe headaches or flashing lights, this can be a sign of a rise in blood pressure and must be investigated at the earliest opportunity.Gestational diabetes This is diabetes which develops during pregnancy. If you develop this, you will be looked after by our specialist diabetes team and have the appropriate appointments and care. For more information on gestational diabetes please visit: https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/patients/ patient-leaflets/gestational-diabetes/ Thrombosis (clotting in the blood) You will be risk assessed throughout your pregnancy for any increased possibility of blood clots. If you experience any of the following, please seek medical advice immediately: Swelling of the leg. Pain in your chest. Coughing up blood. Multiple pregnancy If you are pregnant with twins, triplets etc., you will be referred to our specialist twin continuity team. For more information on multiple pregnancies please visit: https://twinstrust.org https://www.tamba.org.uk https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy- and-baby/pages/what-causes-twins. aspx#closeSecond trimester patient information (13 - 29 weeks) Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy Care 9Group B streptococcus (GBS) GBS is one of the many bacteria that normally live in our bodies, which usually cause no harm. Screening for GBS is not routinely offered to all pregnant women in the UK. If you carry GBS, most of the time your baby will be born safely and will not develop an infection. However, in rare cases, it can cause serious infections such as sepsis, pneumonia or meningitis. Most early onset GBS infections are preventable. If GBS is found in your urine, vagina or rectum (bowel) during your current pregnancy, or if you have previously had a baby affected by GBS infection, you should be offered antibiotics in labour to reduce the small risk of this infection to your baby. If you choose to have these antibiotics, once your labour begins or your waters break, you should contact the Maternity triage for advice about when to come in, so that we can start them at an appropriate time. The risk of your baby becoming unwell with GBS infection is increased if your baby is born preterm, if you have a temperature while you are in labour, or your waters break before you go into labour. If your newborn baby develops signs of GBS infection, they should be treated with antibiotics straight away. Please discuss with your midwife if you have any further questions, or visit: https://rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/ patients/patient-information-leaflets/ pregnancy/pi-gbs-pregnancy-newborn.pdf Attending triage or the day assessment unit during your pregnancy Triage and the day assessment unit have introduced a standardised approach to maternity triage. This prioritises the order in which patients receive medical attention according to their clinical need on arrival at the department. In this way, women requiring urgent attention will be seen first. Once you have been assessed in triage or the day assessment unit, you may be asked to wait in one of the reception areas to be seen by a member of the medical team for between one to four hours, depending on the reason you have attended. See page 11 or the front of your notes for contact details of triage and the day assessment unit. Parent education Preparing for birth and parenthood is beneficial for all pregnant mothers and their partners, particularly those expecting their first baby. Your midwife will signpost you to the wide range of classes we offer, including infant feeding, Dad-to-be classes, pregnancy yoga, hypnobirthing, physiotherapy and many more. For more information, please visit our website: https://www.kingstonmaternity.org.uk/ your-pregnancy/parenting-and-wellbeing- classes.aspx Your baby's movements in pregnancy During your pregnancy, feeling your baby move gives you reassurance of his or her wellbeing. During your pregnancy, you will learn what is normal for your baby. If your baby is not well, they will not be as active as usual. It is therefore important that if you have any concerns, you contact the maternity unit to be seen for assessment. Please do not wait for your next appointment. What are normal movements? Most women become aware of their babies moving at around 18 - 20 weeks of pregnancy. If this is your first pregnancy, you may not be aware of movements until after 20 weeks gestation. Pregnant women can feel their baby's movements as a kick, flutter, swish or roll. Hiccups do not count as movement. As your baby develops and grows, the number and pattern of movement will change. Babies have sleep periods when they are relatively still, typically lasting between 20 - 40 minutes, but are rarely longer than 90 minutes. 10 Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy CareNo specific number of movements is normal. During your pregnancy you need to be aware of your baby's individual pattern of movements. A reduction or change in movement is not to be ignored. If you are unsure of your baby's movements, or you think they have changed from your baby's normal pattern, you should lie down on your left side and focus on the movements. If you are still not feeling movements, you should take action (see below). What should I do if I feel my baby's movements are reduced or changed? Always seek professional help immediately. Never go to sleep ignoring a reduction in your baby's movements. Do not rely on home kits you may have to listen to your baby's heartbeat. Antenatal exercise and advice Caring for your back Due to changes that happen to the musculoskeletal system during pregnancy, lower back pain is a common complaint during the antenatal period. Reasons for this include: Hormones causing structures throughout the body to relax and soften, thereby decreasing stability. The superficial 'six pack' muscles, which normally help to support the spine, separate to allow the baby to grow. Postural changes, weight gain and alterations to your centre of gravity Getting in and out of bed Phone Kingston maternity unit day assessment unit 0208 934 2358 Mon - Fri: 08.00 - 17.00 or, Triage (out of hours) 0208 934 2802 Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy Care 11 3 7 To help protect your back, roll on your side and push yourself up to a sitting position Then stand using your leg muscles.Third trimester patient information (29 - 42 weeks)Complications to look out for in your third trimester It is important to be aware that some symptoms might suggest serious pregnancy complications. Contact your midwife or maternity unit immediately if any of these symptoms occur: Severe headaches. Severe abdominal pain. Changed or reduced fetal movements. Blurred vision. Vaginal bleeding. Persistent itching. Membranes (waters) breaking. Sudden swelling. Severe itching, especially on hands and feet, can be caused by a liver condition known as obstetric cholestasis. Cholestasis can affect the baby and may result in stillbirth if not treated. Blood tests can check to see if you have the condition. If you do, you may require tablets and the baby will require careful monitoring. It is often recommended that the baby be delivered early, between 37 and 38 weeks. For more information about types of tears during childbirth and what can be done to help your recovery visit: www.rcog.org.uk/tearsPerineal trauma The perineum is the area between your vagina and your back passage (anus). It can tear when you are giving birth, or sometimes your health care professional might recommend a cut to your perineum (episiotomy) to make more room for your baby to be born. 9 out of 10 first time mothers have a tear, graze or episiotomy. After the birth of your baby, a health care professional will offer you an examination to see if you have had a tear. They will advise you if you need stitches. Most tears heal within 6 weeks with no long term problems. For women who do have problems after a tear (such as pain, difficulty going to the toilet, incontinence or mental health problems) specialist help is available. Approximately 6 out of 100 women giving birth for the first time, and 2 out of 100 women who have given birth vaginally before, will have a deeper tear involving the back passage / anal sphincter muscle (a 'third' or 'fourth-degree' tear). These deeper tears will need repair in an operating theatre. You will be supported by health care professionals including physiotherapists after your recovery from a third or fourth degree tear. Third trimester patient information (29 - 42 weeks) Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy Care 13ANATOMY OF THE PERINEUMPerineal massage to reduce perineal trauma Perineal massage has been shown to reduce the risk of tears. You may choose to try perineal massage from 35 weeks until your baby is born. This is particularly beneficial for first time mothers. 'Hands-on' birth A kneeling or all fours birthing position may be beneficial and reduce the severity of tearing when your baby is born. You can ask your healthcare professional to support your perineum as your baby is being born, which reduces the risk of a third or fourth degree tear. This is called a 'hands on birth'. Your baby's position If your baby's 'presentation' is not head first ('cephalic' / 'vertex') by 36 weeks of pregnancy, you will have an appointment to discuss this and an individual plan will be made. For useful information on optimum positioning during your pregnancy and labour visit: https://spinningbabies.com What if my baby is found to be in the breech (bottom down) position in pregnancy? Between 3 - 5% of babies will be in a breech (bottom down) position at the end of pregnancy. If you have been told your baby might be in this position you will be referred for an ultrasound scan to confirm the position of your baby. Breech presentation is a variant of normal and does not necessarily mean there is anything wrong with your baby. The most common reasons for your baby to be in a breech position are: Known fetal abnormality. Family history on the mothers side, usually to do with pelvic shape in the family. Uterine anomalies such as a heart-shaped uterus, bicornuate uterus, fibroids, low-lying placenta etc. Babies just forget to turn. If your baby is confirmed on scan to be in the breech position, you will be given the option of an ECV (External Cephalic Version) to try to turn your baby into a head down position, which has up to a 50% chance of being successful. You will also have other Perineal massage tips 1. Warm bath Sit in a warm bath before you start. This may help you to relax before the massage and loosen the muscles around your perineum. 2. Short nails The tissues in your vagina and perineum are very delicate. Make sure your nails are short to prevent scratching the skin, or any discomfort to the area. 3. Comfortable position You need to be relaxed during the massage, so it's important you find a comfortable position. The best place to perform this massage is in bed. Prop yourself up with pillows to support your back and bend your knees. 4. Lubricant Use a lubricant like vitamin E oil, almond oil or olive oil. 5. Thumbs Hold your thumbs in the position shown for about 1 minute (diagram below). Press down towards the anus and to the sides of the vagina walls. Hold your thumbs in this position for about 1 minute. You will begin to feel a stretching sensation. Breathe deeply. 6. Gentle massage Gently massage the lower half of your vagina using a U-shaped movement for 2 - 3 minutes. Repeat this 2 - 3 times. 7. Repeat daily or when possible It may take a couple of weeks of daily massage before you notice more elasticity in your perineal area. 14 Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy Careoptions discussed with you, such as a vaginal breech birth and a planned caesarean section. You will be able to discuss all your options with a clinician experienced in breech presentation. Feeding your baby Nature provides breast milk - the perfect milk to feed your new-born, balanced to suit his / her needs. It protects against gastro-enteritis and diarrhoea, urinary tract infections, ear infections and chest infections; it may also protect against allergies and diabetes. For the mother, breastfeeding reduces the incidence of pre-menopausal breast and ovarian cancer in later life. Colostrum is the first milk you will make and is very protective. It helps to regulate your baby's blood sugar and is easy to digest.Antenatal hand expressing (referred to as colostrum harvesting) is collecting your colostrum in the last few weeks of your pregnancy. Talk to your midwife about when to express and techniques on how to express. Almost all women can breastfeed, but it often needs practice and support to get it right. Discuss your options with your partner, family and friends. It is possible to breastfeed even if you plan to return to work soon after the baby is born. Your midwife / health visitor / support group will help you with this. Even if you didn't manage to breastfeed your previous baby, consider it again for this pregnancy. The majority of mothers succeed the second time. If you decide not to breastfeed, your midwife can instruct you on bottle feeding and sterilisation techniques to ensure safe feeding. If you decide to formula feed, please note that Kingston maternity department does not supply formula milk. Please ensure you bring your own supply of ready-made 'first milk' (not powdered). cephalic (head down)1 transverse2 breech3 Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy Care 15It is a good idea to begin to familiarise yourself with useful resources and breastfeeding support groups in your area in preparation for after your baby is born. Online resources you can use: Baby Buddy app. / Start 4 Life website www.nhs.uk/start4life UNICEF resources: Information and videos on building a happy baby, hand expressing, breastfeeding, formula feeding and Feeding page: has information on what to expect, local support groups: Infant Feeding classes: www.kingstonmaternity.org.uk Kingston Hospital Infant Feeding Facebook pageBrain development of baby New babies have a strong need to be close to their parents, as this helps them to feel secure and loved. When babies feel secure they release a hormone called oxytocin, which acts like a fertiliser for their growing brain. You can even begin to support your baby's brain growth during your pregnancy, by taking some time out to relax and talk to them, to stroke your bump and maybe play some music to them. Encourage other close family members to do the same. Birth preferences Your midwife will discuss your birth preferences with you at your 36 week appointment. There is further information in the 'birthing options' section here, and a section for you to complete in the 'booking and antenatal' section of these notes. 16 Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy Care What to bring to hospital Please note: Try and keep your bags small.

Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy Care 17 Birthing options Choosing where to have your baby At Kingston Maternity Unit, we offer a choice of birth locations: at home, in our midwifery led Birth Centre, or in our obstetric led labour ward. The choice you have about where to have your baby will depend on your individual needs and wishes, but regardless of where you choose to have your baby, we make every effort to make the place of birth as welcoming as possible for both you and your family, where your wishes and privacy are respected. For more information on place of birth: www.kingstonmaternity.org.uk/ media/165000/birth_place_decision_ support_generic_2_.pdf https://www.which.co.uk/reviews/giving- birth/article/guides Having your baby at home Deciding where to have your baby is an important decision. We believe that you should give birth in an environment where you feel safe, comfortable and relaxed. At Kingston, we encourage you to consider giving birth at home, especially if you are healthy and have a straightforward pregnancy. We have a dedicated team of experienced midwives who are passionate about offering homebirth as a safe, relaxed alternative to hospital birth. Those who choose a homebirth receive care from the same midwives throughout pregnancy, labour and early parenthood in the comfort of their own homes.What are the advantages of a homebirth? Planning a homebirth means you are much more likely to be looked after by a midwife you have met before. The team offers excellent continuity of carer throughout the antenatal, labour, birth and postnatal periods and this has been shown to improve outcomes for both mother and baby. Most women find being in labour at home, in comfortable and familiar surroundings, is a calm, relaxing experience and this can help the birth to progress more smoothly. There is no need to interrupt labour to go into hospital and no anxiety about when to make the journey. Evidence shows that multiple journeys to hospital can slow the progress of your labour. Many women wish to use water in the form of a birthing pool as this can be a very effective means of relaxation and relief during labour and birth. Giving birth at home means you are guaranteed use of your own pool. The homebirth team can help you organise pool hire. Being at home means you can move around completely freely, using your own facilities - helping yourself to food from your fridge, using your own shower or bath, watching TV and having a cup of tea in your own bed afterwards! Birthing Options Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy Care 19Is homebirth safe? Birth in the UK is very safe for women and babies, wherever the birth takes place. Evidence shows that healthy women, with an uncomplicated pregnancy, who plan to give birth at home, are more likely to have a straightforward birth with fewer interventions, even if they subsequently transfer to hospital. Interventions include the use of forceps, ventouse, episiotomy and emergency caesarean section. Evidence also shows mothers who book a homebirth are: 40% less likely to need a caesarean section. 50% less likely to need an instrumental birth. 55% less likely to have an episiotomy (small cut in the perineum during birth). 40% less likely to have a 3rd or 4th degree perineal tear. 75% less likely to have an infection during or following the birth. The evidence shows for babies of healthy mothers, who choose a homebirth, there is no difference in outcomes compared to babies born in hospital. For further information see: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/ article/PIIS2589-5370(19)30119-1/fulltext https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/ article/PIIS2589-5370(20)30063-8/fulltext All planned homebirths are attended by 2 experienced midwives. They bring everything necessary to monitor you and your baby's well-being. We work closely with local Ambulance Services to ensure a safe transfer to hospital if one is necessary. Most transfers from home are not emergencies; the most common reason for transferring women from home is when labour is not progressing as expected. This guide may help you understand the statistics and make a decision: https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pregnancy- and-baby/Documents/Birth_place_decision_ support_Generic_2_.pdfIs my home suitable? As long as you can make your home warm and have running water, then generally any home, no matter what its size, can be made suitable for birth. Will I need to buy any special equipment? We will give you a short list of items beforehand that it is helpful for you to provide. These include basic items like towels and old sheets. Your midwives will provide all specialist equipment for the birth on the day. We carry equipment to monitor the baby's heartbeat, to check your blood pressure, pulse and temperature, as well as resuscitation equipment and emergency drugs. The equipment we bring is equivalent to the equipment you will find at our midwife-led Birth Centre. How can I find out more about homebirth? If you would like to speak to a member of the homebirth team, please call us on 020 8934 3752 or email us at khft.homebirth@nhs.net You'll find lots of pictures and stories from recent homebirths on our Instagram: @homebirthkh Why not come along to one of our regular \"Meet the Homebirth Team\" events. Further information can be found on our website, social media or speak to a member of the team: www.kingstonmaternity.org.uk Birth Centre Kingston Birth Centre is situated within the maternity department. The Birth Centre is run by midwives in a home-like environment for women with uncomplicated pregnancies. Evidence suggests that those who give birth in midwife-led units benefit from good perinatal outcomes and low rates of intervention. The evidence has also shown that midwife-led care on a Birth Centre is associated with improved outcomes for mothers and babies, for those with uncomplicated pregnancies who do not wish to give birth at home. Women who choose to labour and birth in the Birth Centre report higher levels of satisfaction and often benefit from early discharge to their homes. 20 Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy CareThe following link will provide you with further information: https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/birthplace#the- birthplace-cohort-study Kingston Birth Centre currently has 4 birthing rooms including 2 birthing pools, an early labour room, postnatal facilities, and an antenatal education/ postnatal room. The Birth Centre is located within the main obstetric unit. Therefore if your labour becomes complicated, we are able to transfer you very quickly to the labour ward for doctors to review your care. Water immersion in labour and waterbirth are both advocated on the Birth Centre. If birth occurs in water, the baby is brought to the surface after he or she is born. Water immersion during labour has calming effects, may help optimise the position of baby in the pelvis, enables women to move freely, is seen as more private and often means that no other analgesia is required. Evidence shows that the length of the first stage of labour may be reduced through water immersion during labour. Women who experienced a waterbirth reported that they were more satisfied with their birth experience and pain was less than they expected. The Birth Centre has a core team of senior midwives who are passionate and committed to facilitating women's choices for a low risk birth. Your midwife may suggest biomechanical manoeuvres which may aid and enhance your labour and birth experience. These manoeuvres are non-invasive and may be effective in promoting optimal positioning of your baby for birth.Obstetric led labour ward If you choose to give birth on the labour ward, you will be looked after by midwives, but the doctors (obstetricians) will be available should you need their help. You will still have choices about the kind of care that you would like. The advantages of giving birth in the obstetric led labour ward include: Having direct access to obstetricians if your labour becomes complicated. Having direct access to anaesthetists (doctors who can give epidurals). There will be neonatologists (specialists in new born care) if there are any problems with your baby. There is one labour room with a birth pool should it be available and it is safe for you to use it. Should your baby need continuous monitoring, we have wireless monitoring in each labour room to help encourage mobility during labour. The greatest efforts will be made to keep your labour and birth as positive as possible on labour ward. You are more than welcome to bring your own music, lighting (no flames permitted) and pillows to make your birthing environment more comfortable. We will always try to be flexible if it is safe to do so. Delayed cord clamping, skin to skin and mobility in labour are all things we encourage as routine practice. This practice is supported in all birthing areas. Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy Care 21 Labour positionsIt is possible you will be cared for by a different midwife from the one who looked after you in the antenatal period. However, if you are booked under a continuity team, it is likely you will be looked after by a midwife from your allocated team who you may have previously met. In both the Birth Centre and labour ward, you are able to have up to 2 birth partners who can stay with you throughout your labour and birth. If you should need to go to theatre for any reason during your birth, only one of your birth partners will be able to accompany you as long as it is safe for them to do so. Labour and birth - what to expect and suggested coping strategies 'Braxton hicks' or 'practice contractions' can occur in the second half of your pregnancy, but are not a sign of labour. They are a result of the uterus tightening irregularly, and can last between 30 and 60 seconds. They are painless but can feel slightly uncomfortable. Latent phase (early labour) This is the start of labour, from when the neck of the uterus (cervix) is closed, until it is open (dilated to 5cm), with regular contractions. Typically: Contractions can last 30 to 60 seconds. Vary in length, strength and frequency every 3 to 20 minutes. May be experienced as backache or lower abdominal period type pain. Can last up to 24 hours, possibly more. Is often a tiring event. You may experience loose stools during the early phase of labour. Normally the best place to be in early labour is at home. The evidence has shown that being at home in your own environment is the best place to support physiology and enable labour to progress. You will also be more comfortable and able to rest in your own environment. An unfamiliar environment can cause anxiety and affect the body's natural labour hormones which are needed to support the normal process of labour and birth. Coping in early labour Certain activities will encourage your baby to adopt the best position for birth, and help you feel more comfortable: Sitting on a birthing ball and leaning forward during a contraction. Sitting the wrong way round and leaning forward over the back of the chair. Moving around on all fours can be really helpful for relieving backache. Lying on your side with pillows or cushion between your legs. Rocking your hips from side to side whilst using the activities mentioned above. Try and avoid sitting right back on the sofa, deep chair or sitting with your legs crossed. What is happening during early labour? The cervix (long and closed during pregnancy) begins to shorten and open. Passing of a clear, pink or lightly blood stained, mucousy show. | Your Pregnancy CareDuring the early stages of labour, there are many things you can do in the comfort of your own home that may help you remain relaxed and calm as your body begins to prepare for the birth your baby. Show this list to your birth partner, so they can remind you to try these during that early stage. Worked your way through this list? Need further advice or alternative pain relief? Please contact Triage on: 0208 934 2802 Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy Care 23Coping with early labour at home Low lights and relaxation Breathing Techniques Positive Affirmations Keeping Mobile Bladder Care Massage Water Rest Aromatherapy Eat and Drink TENS Machine Paracetamol Codydramol Keep lighting dim and relaxed to help those hormones flow. Oxytocin flourishes in warm, dark and relaxed atmospheres. Breathe in slowly through your nose to fill your lungs, hold it for 1 - 2 seconds, then breathe out through your mouth. Relax your jaw and shoulders down. This may not be for everyone, but it is important to remind yourself that you can do it, that the end goal is meeting your baby and it is worth it. Take gentle walks around the house or sit on a birth ball. Moving around will help ease discomfort and progress your labour. Try to empty your bladder regularly, at least four hourly, as this will allow baby to move further down into your pelvis. Slow circular massage at the base of your spine or gentle strokes across your back can be incredibly relaxing. Place a hot water bottle or warm compress on your lower back to help with any back discomfort you may experience and ease cramping sensations. Oxytocin flourishes in warm, dark and relaxed atmospheres. Resting will help you to relax and maintain energy. If you are not comfortable laying down, try leaning over a pillow or birthing ball. Use it on your pillow, on a piece of cloth or in a diffuser to aid with relaxation: Frankinscence for anxiety. Citrus fruits for energy. Lavender for relaxation. Peppermint for nausea. This will keep you hydrated and maintain energy levels. Soft electrical currents disrupt the pain pathway in your back feeling like a constant gentle massage. Can be bought or hired. Is safe to take in pregnancy. 1g every 4 - 6 hours as required. A maximum of 4 doses in 24 hours (a total of 4g in 24 hours). Speak to your GP about a prescription for use in early labour.24 Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy CareWhat to expect in early labour Mucus plug (show)As your cervix begins to soften in preparation for birth, your mucus plug or 'show' is often released. It is a jelly like substance that has been sitting in your cervix throughout your pregnancy; it can be muscousy streaked with blood and may be differentiated from bleeding, as it will often sit on top of a sanitary pad or tissue rather than soak in. Waters breakingYour waters can break at any time throughout your labour; before any discomfort begins, during contractions or not until baby is born. You may experience an obvious \"pop\" and be leaking significant fluid or a gradual slow trickle. Put a pad on, note the time and note the colour. Contact triage if you believe your waters might have broken. TighteningsYou might notice your abdomen tightening intermittently and although this can be uncomfortable these are usually non painful, practice contractions. They may stop altogether, or they may develop into contractions. ContractionsCramps will increase in regularity, strength and length. Eventually they will become regular (around every 2 - 3 minutes), last between 45 seconds and 1 minute and be intense enough that you need to focus on or breathe through them. For first babies, once contractions become this regular we often suggest you remain at home for at least another 2 - 3 hours for labour to establish. For subsequent babies up to one hour for labour to establish.Period like crampingYou may feel discomfort low down in your abdomen, irregular in nature and strength. Cramps may begin as a dull constant ache, then intensify over a period of time. They may stop and start over the hours or days that you are in the early stages of labour.Back painIn the early stages of labour, tightenings and contractions may often be felt in your back. Gentle massage and upright or leaning forward positions may ease this discomfort.

The cervix opens from 5cm to 10cm. The waters might have broken but they may not break at all. Waters 'breaking' If you think your waters have broken call Maternity Triage on 0208 934 2802 who will then give you individual advice, even if you are not contracting. If you are less than 37 weeks gestation you will need to come in to the maternity department immediately and will have a review by one of the doctors on duty. Please bring your maternity notes and your hospital bags. Further information is available from: National Institute of Clinical Excellence: www.nice.org.uk Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists: www.rcog.org.uk Group B Strep Support: www.gbss.org.uk Coming into the hospital You must bring your antenatal notes with you every time you visit the hospital as these are the complete record of your pregnancy. It is important to call triage before you come in, so we can assure there is a midwife available to look after you. When you are in established labour, if your waters have broken or there are any other concerns, you will be asked to come into the maternity unit. Following discussion and assessment, you may be advised to return home; advice will be given on when to call again. Commonly this will be because you are in the early stages of labour. The midwife will base her decision on the stage of your labour, how you are coping and the wellbeing of your baby. Two birth partners are able to accompany you in the birth room.

Please discuss any worries or questions that you have with your midwife.Pain It is not unusual to have some pain following birth. This can be as a result of the type of birth you have had. It can vary from minor discomfort which is eased by bathing and paracetamol, to post-operative pain requiring prescribed pain relief by your GP . If you develop any type of pain, always tell your midwife and she will advise you on what to do to ease the pain. For more information: www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and- baby/you-after-birth/ Uterus (womb) After the birth, your uterus should gradually return to its non-pregnant size. This can take about 10 days. By gently feeling your abdomen your midwife can check this recovery process. Sometimes it may take longer, which in most cases is normal. Occasionally this may be a sign of retained blood or fragments of the placenta or membranes. Often this problem resolves spontaneously, however if you have any heavy bleeding, abdominal pain or high temperature then referral to your GP for antibiotics or further treatment may be required. For more information: www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and- baby/you-after-birth/Blood loss (lochia) Vaginal bleeding following delivery is normal. Your midwife will measure this and record it as estimated blood loss on your notes. Vaginal discharge after childbirth is called lochia - a mix of blood and other products from inside the uterus. At first it is bright red, then becomes pinkish brown, turning to cream. It can be quite heavy at first, requiring several changes of sanitary pads a day. After the first week it slows down, but you may find it lasts three or four weeks before finally disappearing. If you start to lose fresh red blood or clots, have abdominal pain or notice an offensive smell, inform your midwife or GP . However, some fresh red blood loss is normal after a breastfeed. For more information: www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and- baby/you-after-birth/ Breasts All new mothers produce milk in their breasts whether they are breastfeeding or not. After two to three days the breasts may become full and tender but this generally resolves itself. You should seek help and contact your GP or midwife if at any time you notice: a tender, palpable lump. redness of the skin over a lump or area of the breast. you develop flu-like symptoms. In the meantime if breastfeeding, it is important to \"move the milk.\" Keep feeding your baby and express your milk to drain the breast as much as possible after the feed; gentle massage of the affected area during the feed and whilst expressing can help. If your nipples or breasts are sore you need to seek advice on correct positioning and attachment of baby whilst you are breastfeeding. For more information: www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and- baby/breast-pain-and-breastfeeding/ 30 Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy Care Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy Care 31Sleep As your nights will be disturbed caring for your baby, it is important to catch up on sleep or rest when you can as your body is still recovering from the birth. Try to have a sleep or rest at least once a day when your baby is sleeping. For more information: www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and- baby/sleep-and-tiredness/ Bladder (passing urine) Soreness after the birth can make passing urine painful initially, but it should resolve quickly. Drinking plenty of fluids to keep the urine diluted helps. For the first few days following birth you may not realise that your bladder needs emptying. It is therefore important when you're awake to pass urine approximately every 2 - 4 hours for the first 10 days. If after this time you are finding that you are leaking urine more than once a day, see your midwife or GP for specialist referral once other underlying causes such as infection have been excluded. You can help yourself to improve your bladder control by doing your pelvic floor exercises (explained later in this section). For more information: www.nhs.uk/conditions/urinary- incontinence/ Bladder & Bowel Community: www.bladderandbowel.org/bladder- faeces/motions) Constipation is very common after childbirth. This can be made worse by avoiding opening your bowels for fear of pushing, particularly if you have had stitches, or haemorrhoids (piles). Piles can be treated using good hygiene, preparatory creams and stool softeners. Pain relief medication can help. You can help prevent constipation by eating a high fibre diet including fresh fruit and vegetables and drinking plenty of fluids.Occasionally some women have difficulty getting to the toilet in time and may have an accident. This is not normal and you can get help. Please ask yourself the following to gauge if what you are experiencing is normal: 1. On average, how many times do you open your bowels in 24hrs? If this is more than 4 times in 24hrs, discuss with your midwife or GP . 2. Do you have to rush to the toilet when you need to open your bowels? If most of the time, please speak to your midwife or GP . It is likely that if you are suffering from the above you will need to be referred to see a physiotherapist. In most instances, following their care plan will help resolve the problem. For more information: www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and- baby/you-after-birth/ Perineum (area between vagina and anus) It is normal for your perineum (the area between your vagina and your anus) to be sore and uncomfortable in the days following your baby's birth. If you need pain relief, you can take two 500mg paracetamol tablets every 4 to 6 hours, up to a maximum of 8 tablets in 24 hours. If you require further pain relief, Ibuprofen can be taken in conjunction with Paracetamol, up to 400mg every 8hrs. If you are taking any other medication, please check that it is safe to take with paracetamol and ibuprofen. It is important to keep your perineum clean, as it is a common area for infection. Daily showers are very important and you should change your sanitary pads at least every 2 to 3 hours, washing your hands before and after doing so. If you have had stitches, these should dissolve over two weeks as your perineum heals. It is not unusual for a small amount of gaping where the stitches are. This will heal over time. However, if there is any offensive smell, redness, swelling or the area is getting more painful, this may be a sign of infection and needs to be checked by your midwife or GP as soon as possible.Ensuring a good diet and fluid intake will help relieve constipation, which may be adding to the discomfort. Cold gel pads can also help to relieve some discomfort. Pelvic floor exercises should be undertaken following delivery unless you have been advised against this (see opposite for more information). Tampons should not be used until at least 6 weeks after birth to reduce the risk of infection. For more information: www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and- baby-episiotomy/ Care of the pelvic floor and perineum The pelvic floor is layers of muscle stretching from the pubic bone at the front of the pelvis to the bottom of the backbone, like a hammock. They help hold the bladder, uterus and bowel in place and close the outlets of the bladder and back passage preventing leakage of urine and faeces. Weaknesses in the muscles caused by pregnancy and childbirth reduce their ability to give support, potentially leading to such leakages, regardless of how your baby was born. Exercising the pelvic floor both ante and postnatally can lower these risks by up to 40%. Toning these muscles in the short term can also reduce swelling and soreness. Begin pelvic floor exercises as soon as you can in pregnancy and continue to do so as soon as possible after delivery regardless of the type of delivery you have. Note: if you have a catheter, wait until this is out and you are passing urine normally before recommencing your pelvic floor exercises. Short squeezes for strength (helps your muscles react when you cough, sneeze or laugh): 1. Get comfortable - sit or lie with your knees slightly apart. 2. 'Squeeze and lift' as if trying to stop yourself from passing wind as well as stopping the flow of urine. 3. Hold for no more than one or two seconds, rest for one or two seconds, then repeat. Try not to hold your breath, pull your stomach muscles excessively, squeeze your legs together or tighten your buttocks.4. Do these three to five times per day as part of your daily routine, perhaps when you use the toilet or feed your baby. Long squeezes for stamina: 1. Repeat as per short squeezes; however, hold the squeeze for four seconds with a break of three seconds between each one. 2. As these exercises become easier, hold each squeeze for longer, up to around 10 seconds. Remember, quality is better than quantity, so begin with as many as you can hold strongly and then aim to increase repetitions up to around 10 of both short and long squeezes. If you have any problems with your bladder, it is important to discuss these with your midwife or GP . Checking the strength of these muscles By 12 weeks after the birth of your baby, these muscles should be returning to normal. At this stage, try this test: 1. Stand with feet apart (about 2 hours after passing urine so there is something in your bladder). 2. Jump up and down on the spot. 3. Progress to doing the same exercise with a full bladder and with feet further apart. You should be dry. If you find you are damp or leak urine on coughing/ running etc, continue with pelvic floor exercises and discuss with your GP , who can refer you for physiotherapy assessment and treatment.

This risk is increased if you are over 35 years of age, overweight, a smoker or have a family history of thrombosis. It is important for you to do regular ankle exercises. Women who have had a caesarean are encouraged to wear special stockings for up to 6 weeks, or until they are as mobile as they were prior to surgery. If you have any of the following symptoms: pain, redness, heat or swelling in your legs, you are advised to report it straight away to the hospital, your midwife or GP . These can be signs of DVT (deep vein thrombosis). If you have pain in your chest, or sometimes in the back or shoulders, with shortness of breath or coughing up blood, this may be a sign of pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung) and you should inform your GP or midwife immediately, as this is a very serious condition. For more information: www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and- baby/dvt-blood-clot-pregnant/ Please refer to the patient information sheet: 'Reducing your risk of developing a blood clot.' Important symptoms Abnormal vaginal bleeding Varying amounts of blood loss during and after birth affect women in different ways. If you begin to develop symptoms including palpitations, dizziness, a rapid pulse, weakness, sweating and restlessness following or during a heavy blood loss, you should contact your midwife or GP immediately. Infection The midwife will check your temperature, pulse and breathing rate as required, depending on the type of birth you have had. A high temperature, rapid pulse and increased breathing rate may be a sign of infection. Signs of infection to look out for following childbirth are: fever and chills; lower abdominal pain and tenderness; offensive, foul-smelling vaginal discharge; and a tender uterus. If you develop any of these tell your midwife or GP . For more information: www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and baby/you-and-your-baby-postnatal-period/ Headache with neck stiffness, fever and visual disturbances Many women may suffer from tension headaches and / or migraines after birth. These usually resolve with mild pain relief (e.g. paracetamol) and rest. Relaxation exercises may also help to get rid of tension. If however you have a sudden onset severe headache with neck stiffness and a high temperature, you should contact your midwife or GP straight away. If the severe headache occurs within 3 days of the birth and is accompanied with heartburn-type pain, blurred vision and flashing lights, nausea or vomiting, it may indicate a sudden rise in blood pressure - a sign of pregnancy induced hypertension or pre-eclampsia. This is very rare, however if any of these symptoms occur, you need to inform your midwife or GP immediately. Your blood pressure will be checked after the birth and subsequently as required. For more information: www.nhs.uk/conditions/pre-eclampsia/ treatment/ If you had an epidural and then develop a headache which worsens when you are upright, but is relieved when you lie down and is accompanied by nausea and vomiting and ringing in the ears, this could be symptomatic of epidural complications and should be reported to your midwife or GP . For more information: www.nhs.uk/conditions/epidural/side- effects/Red, painful area on the breast This is most common in women who are breast feeding and may be due to infective or non-infective mastitis. Symptoms are a high temperature and flu- like symptoms. Non-infective mastitis is usually caused by blocked milk ducts. It is relieved by frequent feeding and effective attachment. If the symptoms persist after a couple of feeds, there may be an infection present, especially if you have cracked nipples. Contact your GP as you may need antibiotic treatment. Neither is a reason to stop breastfeeding, as this helps to keep the milk flowing and relieve symptoms. Your midwife will check that your baby is attached effectively, and will show you how to relieve the symptoms by massaging the breast, as well as how to hand express between feeds. Analgesia will help to relieve the symptoms and it is important to rest and drink plenty of fluids. Breastfeeding and thrush Some women develop thrush in their breasts. This may happen if you have been given antibiotics or as a result of cracked nipples. You and your baby may have no signs of infection, but if you develop marked nipple pain or shooting pains during feeding, which continues after the feed, contact your GP as you may need treatment. It is important that both you and your baby are treated. For more information: www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and- baby/breast-pain-and-breastfeeding/ Persistent fatigue, faintness, dizziness, tingling fingers and toes These are all symptoms of anaemia, which is caused by too little haemoglobin (Hb) in the red blood cells. This can be treated with iron supplements and dietary advice. If you are concerned, discuss this with your midwife or GP . For more information: www.nhs.uk/conditions/iron-deficiency- anaemia/Backache This is common after childbirth and is likely to improve with mild pain relief and normal activity. Your midwife will advise you on the correct posture when handling, lifting and feeding your baby. If you experience pain radiating down one or both legs, this could be nerve root pain (sciatica) and you should consult your GP . For more information: www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and- baby/your-body-after-childbirth/ Painful intercourse (dyspareunia) After childbirth it is not unusual for intercourse to be uncomfortable initially, and may be one of the reasons why many couples find enthusiasm for sex reduced for a time. Lubricant gel may ease the soreness and effective contraception may relieve the added concern of another pregnancy. However, if the pain persists see your GP , who can assess whether you may need to be referred to a specialist. For more information: www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and- baby/episiotomy/ www.nhs.uk//live-well/sexual-health/ vagina-changes-after-childbirth/ Emotional wellbeing: help and support at home You will probably need a lot of help first, not just practically, but also emotionally. The more you can share your baby's care, the more you will enjoy your baby. You are bound to feel up and down and get tired easily in the early days. Your partner can help with bathing, changing and dressing as well as cuddling and playing. If you are on your own, or your partner is unable to be with you, perhaps your mother or a friend can be there. You may find it helpful to discuss any problems or worries you have with your midwife or GP . Adjusting to a new baby can leave parents drained, especially in your first few months. Loss of help and all the new challenges in understanding how to meet your baby's needs can add to the pressure. 34 Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy CareKingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy Care 35There is often little or no time for you and your partner to spend time together, and attempting to be super parents may leave you both exhausted. Keep meals simple, try to space visitors out and if you need extra help - ask. You may also want to talk to mothers in a similar situation. Your health visitor has information about child health clinics, or mother and baby groups in your area. Other contact numbers and support groups are available. Baby blues The majority of women will experience some level of 'baby blues' in the days following the birth of their baby, normally peaking at around three or four days. This is a normal response to changing hormones combined with lack of sleep and discomfort as your body recovers. This normally resolves after a few days, but it is very important during this time to rest and receive extra support with baby. Adjusting to parenthood can be draining, particularly in the first few weeks when your sleep patterns are disturbed. Getting some sleep when your baby sleeps and asking for support when you need it are very important during this time. Having plenty of skin- to-skin contact with your baby can help by affecting hormone levels, raising those that evoke positive feelings. Other types of emotional changes that can occur after childbirth It is important that if the 'baby blues' do not disappear after a week or so, that you discuss this with your midwife, GP or health visitor. 10 to 15% of new mothers have some experience of postnatal depression. Many more - perhaps half - go through spells of feeling very low, lacking in confidence, loneliness, isolation and exhaustion. These are normal feelings if you have just given birth, but usually they are mild.If you are experiencing any of the following symptoms, please do not be afraid to discuss them with your midwife, GP or health visitor, as it is something they are used to helping with: Feelings of anxiety. Varying degrees of tearfulness and irritability. Loss of confidence. Feelings of hopelessness or despondency. Sleeping and eating difficulties. Loss of interest in yourself or your baby. Difficulty coping with day to day tasks. Feeling better in company and worse alone. Dissatisfaction with the quality of life. Feelings of loneliness and isolation. What can be done if you develop postnatal depression? It is a real illness and the most important part of treatment involves telling someone how you feel. Simple things like talking about your feelings, expanding your social network and obtaining support from family, friends and professionals may be all that is required. Your midwife, health visitor or GP can help you and can arrange for further support. Your GP may prescribe anti-depressants, which are not considered to be addictive, and have been found to be extremely helpful in treating the symptoms.

Ask your GP for more details. You will need to make an appointment to see your GP six to eight weeks after the birth. If you were due for a cervical screening test (smear test) while pregnant then this should be rescheduled for 12 weeks after birth. For more information: www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and- baby/postnatal-check/ Support at Home Following your discharge from hospital, you will be seen at home or in the postnatal clinics by a community midwife, therefore ensure that you confirm your contact details with the midwife prior to leaving the hospital. It is important that you contact the midwifery team if you do not receive any planned visit. The health visitor usually visits you at home around 10 - 14 days after the baby's birth. Maternity Voices (MVP) Your local Maternity Voice partnership group is a team made up of new parents, volunteers from community groups, midwives, doctors and other allied health professionals who meet to discuss, learn and help share ideas to improve local maternity care within your area. For more information search: www.nationalmaternityvoices.org.ukHealthy eating and drinking With a new baby it is important to eat a healthy, balanced diet containing bread, breakfast cereals, potatoes, pasta, and rice to give you energy, as well as fruit and vegetables. Lean meat, chicken, fish, eggs and pulses are good sources of protein. Dairy foods, such as milk, cheese and yoghurt contain calcium as well as protein. It is also important that you are a healthy weight for your height before you become pregnant again. If you have concerns about your weight, contact your GP . General postnatal exercise Postnatal exercises are very important and should be tailored to your individual needs dependent on the type of birth you have had. They include abdominal, leg and breathing exercises as well as relaxation techniques. Please see later in this booklet for recommended postnatal exercises.

For more information: www.gov.uk/browse/childcare-parenting/ financial-help-childrenPostnatal exercise and advice - physiotherapy advice Keeping fit and healthy Depending on the type of birth, you can start gentle exercise as long as you feel up to it. It is usually a good idea to wait until after your 6 week postnatal check before you begin any high impact exercise. For more information: www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy- andbaby/keeping-fit-and-healthy/ Below are easy exercises and advice to help you get back into shape after the birth of your baby. Start on the day your baby is born. Movements for circulation and relaxation: To help with circulation in the legs: 1. In sitting or lying position, bend and stretch your ankles upwards and downwards briskly, so that you can feel your calf muscles acting as a pump, 2. Repeat regularly until you are up and moving about as normal . Movements for circulation and relaxationStart some deep breathing: 1. Sitting with knees bent, rest your hand on your tummy. 2. Take a slow deep breath in through the nose, feeling your chest expand and your tummy rise. 3. Sigh out through your mouth as your tummy falls. Repeat 5 times Following a caesarean section If you need to cough, laugh or sneeze, the best position to do this in is either sitting up, or if lying, have your knees bent up. This position may help to make you more comfortable: Support your stitches with your hands or a pillow as shown, try a forced breath out as if fogging up a mirror - a 'huff' rather www.nhs.uk/conditions/caesarean-section/ recovery/ Getting Out of Bed 38 Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy Care Getting out of bed will be easiest if you roll onto your side first: Remember: Do not pull on the bed head or do a 'sit up'1. Put your feet over the side of the bed as you push yourself up with your arms. Do the reverse to get back into bed. 2. To move up the bed, roll onto your back and push with your hands and feet.Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy Care 39Positions to Rest and Relax in Following a vaginal delivery you may wish to try this position: Lie on your tummy with one pillow under your upper body and one underneath your tummy. This position is useful if you have: a painful, swollen perineum and / or stitches, haemorrhoids (piles), a painful coccyx or lower backache. This position may be useful following a vaginal delivery or a caesarean section: Lie on your side with one pillow under your tummy and one under your top leg. Following a vaginal delivery, if you have a painful or swollen perineum, episiotomy, tear, or haemorrhoids (piles), try sitting on pillows as shown. Fold each pillow in half and position so that a space is left between them.Caring for your back Lower back pain is common during pregnancy. It is often a result of hormones causing the ligaments to soften, or increased weight gain. Though the pain may disappear after the birth, your back is still vulnerable to strain for the next 5 to 6 months because: It will take 4 - 5 months after your baby is born for your ligaments to return to their normal strong state. Your stomach muscles, which normally help to support the spine, are weak. The increased hormones in your body make your joints more flexible putting them at greater risk of damage. Caring for your baby will involve lifting, carrying, feeding and changing; all of which will put extra strain on your back. Everyday activities You should try to look after your back by making sure all the activities you carry out frequently are done in comfortable, well-supported positions. Take the time to work out the best position to adopt when feeding, changing and lifting your baby. Here are some useful tips: Feeding: Sit with your bottom well back in the chair so that your back is supported. You may find a small cushion or a rolled towel in the small of the back helps you sit more upright. Rest your feet flat on the floor or on a low foot stool. Place a pillow on your knees and use it to support your baby, keeping your shoulders relaxed. You may also breastfeed whilst lying on your side. Your midwife or health visitor will be able to give you advice. 3 7 Changing: Ideally find a changing surface that is waist height. Whether you sit, stand or kneel, remember not to stoop. Lifting: Remember, whenever you are lifting, tighten your pelvic floor and deep abdominal muscles. Bend your knees, get close to the object you are picking up and use your strong leg muscles to stand up. This will help to protect your back and pelvic floor. Try and avoid heavy lifting initially. Gradually build up to more strenuous activities. 40 Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy Care33 77 Good Posture It is very important to maintain good posture at all times, do not allow yourself to slouch. stand tall1 tummy in3bottom tucked in2 relaxed knees4 pelvic floor up5Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy Care 41The Abdominal Muscles The abdominal muscles are two columns of muscle, which lie either side of the navel, and are joined by a fibrous band in the mid-line. During pregnancy this gap widens to allow the baby to grow. After delivery, the gap starts to close up, but you must avoid movements which will further strain these muscles e.g. twisting or straining to get from lying by doing a sit up. At about the 3rd day after your vaginal delivery, or the 5th day after your caesarean section, you can check for muscle separation. Lie on your back with your knees bent. Press the fingers of one hand firmly into your tummy muscles just above your tummy button (palm facing you). Then lift your head and shoulders slowly until your neck is about 8 inches from the horizontal. Breathe out as your head comes up. You will feel the bands of muscle on each side drawing together, pushing your fingers out of the way. It is important not to progress to Stage 3 of the abdominal exercises until the gap is approximately 1 to 2 fingers width (described on the next page). If the gap is 4 - 5 fingers or more it might help to give abdominal support if you wear 'big knickers' with medium control.Exercising your abdominal muscles You can start to tone up your abdominal muscles as soon as you feel well enough. This may be as early as the day after the birth (even if you have had a caesarean section). Three stages of exercises are outlined below. We advise that you begin by working the deep muscles described in Stage 1 as these will help to reduce the strain on your back and pelvic floor. Once you feel that they are strong enough, move on to Stage 2 to improve your outer muscles and finally to Stage 3. You would usually begin Stage 3 about 4 to 6 weeks after birth; however, this will vary from person to person. Aim to do your exercises 3 times a day. Stage 1: The deep abdominals This exercise works the deepest abdominal muscles which act like a corset to support your back and pelvis. It also helps flatten your stomach and draws in your waistline. 1. Lie comfortably on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the bed or the floor. 2. Breathe in and let your tummy rise. 3. As you breathe out, gently draw your lower tummy towards your spine. 4. Hold for a count of 5, then let go. Remember: Do not move your back or hold your breath. Try different starting positions: Lying face down with a pillow under your stomach. Lying on your side. PULL IN BREATHE OUTHow many should I do? You should aim, initially, to repeat 5 times and build up gradually. Eventually you should try to hold for a maximum of 10 seconds and repeat 10 times. After six weeks you can do the exercise on all fours. Remember: It is very important to use the deep abdominal and pelvic floor muscles in everyday activities. Hold them in while carrying your baby, lifting baby equipment and during housework. This will help to reduce the strain on your back. Stage 2: The pelvic tilt Begin by performing the deep abdominal exercise. Whilst drawing your tummy in, gently contract your pelvic floor and tighten your buttocks, tilt your pelvis up and flatten your back into the floor or bed. Hold for a count of 5 then let go. How many should I do? Aim to build up gradually, repeating 5 to 10 times and holding for a maximum of 10 seconds. Remember: Keep your tummy flat. Stop if you notice your tummy bulging and go back to Stage 1. Try Stage 2 in a few days.Stage 3: The head lift Begin by performing the pelvic tilt and contract your pelvic floor muscles. As you breathe out, lift your head. Do not lift your shoulders to begin with. Hold for a few seconds, then release gently and rest for a few seconds. Once you feel confident with the head lift you can progress by: Holding for longer - up to a maximum of 10 seconds and keep breathing. Raising your head and shoulders. Remember: The exercises should not cause you pain. Do them in a slow, controlled way and progress at a speed that suits you. Do not exercise if you feel tired or unwell. Your progression will depend on many factors: The strength of your muscles before pregnancy. The amount of discomfort you have. The type of birth: after a caesarean section your progression may initially be slower. Avoid strenuous exercises like 'sit-ups' or lifting both legs up when lying on your back. These may be harmful. 42 Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy Care BREATHE OUTKingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy Care 43Functional integration of abdominal exercise Use these exercises during everyday activities: Relaxation Try to set aside 10 minutes each day in a well- supported position, perhaps with your baby. Pull your shoulders down towards your feet for a few seconds and then release. Feel your neck stretched and shoulders further away from your ears than before. Stretch your fingers out long, and release. Feel your fingers long and your thumbs heavy. Breathe in slowly allowing your tummy to swell; then breathe out slowly. Enjoy that relaxed feeling as long as possible.General exercise Always start exercising gradually, and progress at a pace that suits you. Walking with your pram is good exercise at first. Gradually increase your walking distance and speed as you can. Swimming is excellent all round exercise (after bleeding has stopped). Pilates or yoga classes are excellent and may be started after 6 to 8 weeks. Avoid other strenuous and high impact exercises during the first 12 weeks e.g. running, tennis, weights and sit-ups. For more information: www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and- baby/keeping-fit-and-healthy/ Planning for next time It is recommended that you do not have intercourse until after the bleeding has stopped and you feel ready. This allows time for healing to take place and to prevent infection. It may take longer depending on your own recovery and if you have had stitches or a caesarean. It is very common during the early months to experience a reduction in sexual desire, due to many factors such as tiredness and adjusting to your new role in life. Returning to normal sexual relations is very dependent on the individual. Family Planning There are many forms of contraception, ranging from natural family planning - such as methods based on urine testing; barrier methods - male and female condoms, diaphragms, caps, and spermicidal foams, creams and jellies; hormonal contraception - pill and implants and intra-uterine devices (coil) are also available. Permanent methods are tubal ligation for women and vasectomy for men. All these choices may seem confusing. You can ask your GP , practice nurse or family planning clinic for more information on any method that you are interested in. Pregnancy puts a strain on your body, so it is recommended to leave time (at least a year) between pregnancies in order for your body to recover. This is particularly important if you have had a caesarean section or if you are at higher risk of having a preterm birth, in which case a break of at least 18 months to 2 years between pregnancies is recommended. It is important to be aware that most methods of contraception do not protect you from sexually transmitted infections. For more information: www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception/Folic acid When you are trying to get pregnant again, you should take 400 micrograms (mcg) folic acid supplement daily, from the time you stop using contraception until the 12th week of pregnancy, to protect your baby from spinal defects. If you have diabetes or epilepsy, you or your family have a history of spinal defects, or your BMI is over 30, you will require a higher dose of 5mg. See your GP who can advise you. For more information: www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and- baby/vitamins-minerals-supplements- pregnant/ 44 Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy Care BABY Postnatal informationAt each postnatal assessment, your midwife will check your baby's well-being. The following observations help to build up a complete picture of your baby and your midwife will discuss the findings with you. Temperature Your midwife will check how warm your baby feels to the touch which is a good indication of how appropriate the temperature is around your baby. Your midwife can advise on the amount of clothing and bedding to use, whether in the house, car or pram etc. If there are any concerns about your baby's temperature, your midwife will take your baby's temperature using a thermometer. Breathing Your midwife will observe your baby's breathing. Your baby will breathe faster than adults. Their normal respiration rate is between 30 - 60 breaths / min. Heart Rate Your baby's heart rate is also faster than an adults'. In a newborn, a normal heart rate is between 100 and 160 beats / min. Weight It is expected for your baby to lose weight in the first 3 - 5 days; they should start to gain weight after this. Your baby will be weighed at birth; then if you are seen on day 3, he / she may also be weighed. He / she will normally be weighed again on days 5 and 10. Your health visitor will give you information about local child health clinics. They will continue assessing your baby's growth as he / she gets older. Most babies double their birth weight by four to five months and treble their birth weight by one year.Tone (muscle tone - activity and reflexes) Your midwife will check to see that your baby can move both arms and legs. In the early days and weeks your baby will have some involuntary movements which are called reflexes. These include: The root reflex which begins when the baby's cheek is stroked or touched. The baby will turn his / her head and open his / her mouth to follow and \"root\" in the direction of the stroking. This helps the baby find the breast or bottle and begin feeding. Babies are born with the ability to suck and during the first few days they learn to coordinate their sucking and breathing. The startle reflex occurs when a baby is startled by a loud sound or movement. The baby throws back its head, extends out the arms and legs, cries, then pulls the arms and legs back in. A baby's own cry can startle him / her and begin this reflex. They can also grasp things like your finger with either their hands or feet and they will make stepping movements if they are held upright on a flat surface. All these responses, except sucking, will be lost within a few months and your baby will begin to make controlled movements instead. Colour Your midwife will check that your baby looks healthy and well perfused. Changes in skin colour can indicate that your baby may require closer observation. See below for information on Jaundice (yellow colouring of the skin).BABY Postnatal information 46 Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy CareEyes Your baby's eyes are observed for any signs of stickiness, redness or discharge. Cleaning of your baby's eyes is not required unless your baby develops an infection. This can occur for no apparent reason and appears as a yellow discharge in one or both eyes. If this happens, your midwife may take a swab or arrange for your GP to prescribe treatment. Your midwife will also show you how to clean the eyes properly. It is common for a newborn to have poor control of their eyes and appear cross-eyed at times, but this should decrease as the eye muscles strengthen. The eyes usually look blue-grey or brown. In general, your baby's permanent eye colour will be apparent within 6 to 12 months. Mouth Your baby's mouth is checked for redness, white spots or a white coating, which does not disappear between feeds. Your midwife will discuss with you if they have any concerns. Cord The stump of the cord will drop off between 7 - 10 days following the birth. It usually does not require any special attention, other than careful washing and drying at bath time. It is very common for the stump to bleed slightly as it separates and your midwife will advise you how to care for this. Usually all that is required is to ensure the nappy does not rub on the area. If there is any heavy bleeding, discharge, redness, or bad smell around the cord stump you should contact your midwife or health visitor. Skin Your baby's skin is very sensitive in the early weeks. Your midwife will check your baby's skin for any spots, rashes or dryness. After your baby is born it may have small amounts of vernix left in the skin folds, such as under the arms. This is the white creamy substance that protects their skin whilst inside your uterus. It is not harmful to your baby and in fact will help moisturise your baby's skin. It will disappear over the next few days so there is no need to try to remove it.Some babies have dry skin in the first few weeks after birth; this is more common if your baby was born after the due date. Avoid using baby bath liquid or soap when bathing your baby. After washing, pat dry and make sure skin creases are dry. You may wish to rub some organic cold pressed sunflower oil onto your baby's skin (avoiding their face and hands); ask your midwife for more information. For more information: www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and- baby/pages/your-baby-after-birth.aspx Urine You should expect your baby to have the following wet nappies: Day No. of wet nappies 1 - 2 at least 1 - 2 3 - 4 at least 3 7 onwards at least 6 You may notice a red / orange / pink residue in your baby's nappy over the first 24 - 48 hours. These are called urates and are crystals from your baby's kidneys. They should disappear after a couple of days. This will be helped by regular feeding. Bowels (stools) The first stools are sticky, greenish-black and are called meconium. Over the next few days, the colour of your baby's stool will change as follows: Day No. per 24 hrs Colour of stools 1 - 2 at least 1 meconium 3 - 4 at least 2 changing stools, greeny-brown 5 onwards at least 2 mustard yellow, 'seedy' If this doesn't happen, please inform your midwife, health visitor or GP . Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy Care 47Breastfed babies will have soft, loose yellow stools that do not smell, while a formula fed baby will have stools that are more formed, darker and smellier. All babies should pass at least two soft stools per day for the first six weeks regardless of feeding method. If your baby has a higher number and it is looser than normal, contact your healthcare professional. If you have any concerns, ask your midwife or GP for advice. The fontanelle When born, a baby's skull is not fully fused together in order to help it pass through the birth canal. This leaves a diamond shaped patch on the top of your baby's head near the front called the fontanelle. It will probably be a year or more before the bones close over it. You may notice it moving as your baby breathes. You don't need to worry about touching it as there is a tough layer of membrane under the skin. Your midwife will check that this is not sunken which can be a sign that your baby is dehydrated. Feeding your baby Responsive feeding Keep your baby close to you so that you start to recognise feeding and comfort cues. Responding to these cues will make your baby feel safe. Breastfed babies cannot be overfed so you can use breastfeeding to soothe your baby and as a way of spending time together, or having a rest whenever you both want.Skin-to-skin contact Spending some time quietly holding your baby in skin to skin contact (baby naked or with just a nappy against your bare chest, covered by a blanket) straight after the birth is very important because: it helps to calm your baby; regulates their temperature helping keep him or her warm; steadies your baby's breathing; and gives you time to bond. It also helps to get breastfeeding off to a good start. Provided you are both well, you will be able to hold your baby straight away. If you have had a caesarean delivery, or have been separated from your baby for a while after the birth, you will both still benefit from skin to skin contact as soon as you are both able. Skin to skin is recommended as often as possible with your baby, and can also be done by your partner. Keeping baby close New babies have a strong need to be close to their parents, as this helps them to feel secure and loved. When babies feel secure they release a hormone called oxytocin, which helps their brains to grow and helps them to be happy babies and more confident children and adults. Holding, smiling and talking to your baby also releases oxytocin in you, which helps you to feel calm and happy. For more | Your Pregnancy CareSome common things to be aware of in the early days Bumps and bruises It is quite common for a newborn baby to have some swelling (caput) and bruises on the head, and perhaps to have bloodshot eyes, particularly if you had an instrumental delivery. This is the result of the squeezing and pushing that is part of being born and will soon disappear. Birthmarks and spots Marks or spots that you may notice mainly on the head and face of your baby usually fade away eventually. Most common are the little pink or red marks some people call stork bites. These v-shaped marks on the forehead, upper eyelids and nape of the neck gradually fade, though it may be some months before they disappear completely. Strawberry marks are also very common. They are dark red and slightly raised, appearing a few days after the birth, sometimes getting bigger. These too will disappear eventually. Some babies will have Blue Spots which look like bruises - often found at the base of the back, on the buttocks and lower limbs. These are more common in babies of darker skinned ethnicities and normally fade in time. For more information: NHS Choices: www.nhs.uk/conditions/ birthmarks Breasts and genitals Quite often a newborn baby's breasts are a little swollen and may ooze some milk, whether the baby is a boy or girl. Girls sometimes bleed slightly or have a discharge from the vagina. This is the result of hormones passing from the mother to the baby before birth and is no cause for concern. The genitals of male and female newborn babies often appear rather swollen, but will look in proportion to their bodies in a few weeks.Jaundice (yellow colour) On about two to three days after birth, some babies develop a yellow colour to their skin and whites of the eyes due to mild jaundice. It is caused by a substance known as bilirubin, which builds up in baby's blood as a result of fast breakdown of red blood cells. This is a normal process and does no harm. The jaundice usually fades within 10 days or so, but it may last for up to two weeks. If your baby is jaundiced and very sleepy with green or pale stools, this could be a sign that the level of their jaundice is more serious. A serum bilirubin blood test (SBR) may be recommended to determine what the level of jaundice is. If treatment is indicated this is done using phototherapy. The undressed baby is placed under a very bright light, usually with a soft mask over the eyes. This may continue for several days before the jaundice clears up. You will be advised according to your individual circumstances. Please see below for more information on prolonged jaundice. For more information visit NHS Choices: www.nhs.uk/conditions/jaundice-newborn Excessive crying Some babies cry a lot and this can be very stressful. There may be times when you feel unable to cope. This happens to lots of parents and is nothing to be ashamed of. Ask your family and friends to help and discuss this with your health visitor or GP . For more information: www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and- baby/soothing-crying-baby/ Nappy rash The skin on a baby's bottom is sensitive and prolonged contact with urine or stools can cause burning or reddening of the skin. Nappies should be changed frequently, either before or after feeds to prevent this. There are many possible causes of nappy rash, for example poor hygiene and skin care, infection, sensitivity to detergents, fabric softeners or other Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy Care 49products that have been in contact with the skin. If the skin does become sore, it is better to use warm water and cotton wool rather than wipes or lotions to clean your baby. Cream can be used, but if the rash does not improve advice should be sought from your GP . For more information visit NHS choices: www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and- baby/nappy-rash/ Problems to look out for Colic A baby who cries excessively and inconsolably and either draws up his or her knees, or arches his or her back, especially in the evening, may have colic. You should tell your midwife or GP so that an assessment can be made to rule out other causes. They will then advise you according to your individual circumstance. For more information: NHS Choices: www.nhs.uk/conditions/colic Prolonged jaundice This is when jaundice is still present after 2 weeks, in which case an SBR may be recommended to detect the level of jaundice. If treatment is indicated, this is done using phototherapy. See page 49 for more information. Infection Some babies are at increased risk of developing infections in the eyes, umbilicus, urinary tract or on the skin, particularly if the mother has: an existing infection such as Group B haemolytic streptococcus. rupture of membranes (waters breaking) for more than 24 hours. a temperature in labour greater than 37.5\u00b0C.Symptoms of infections are what your midwife is looking for during the baby assessments, and can appear as sticky eyes, redness around the umbilicus and septic spots, which may or may not be accompanied by your baby being generally unwell. If you have concerns regarding any of these factors contact your midwife / GP . Low blood sugar A low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) in a normally grown term baby is unusual. However, screening for hypoglycaemia may be indicated if he or she was born prematurely, is very small or very large, had a difficult delivery or you have diabetes. Prematurity (less than 37 weeks of pregnancy) If your baby was born early, there is an increased risk of conditions such as prolonged jaundice, infection, a low blood sugar and vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB). This all depends on how early your baby has been born. If admission to neonatal intensive care is required, you will be advised according to your individual circumstances. Healthcare professionals who may help care for you and your baby Midwives Your midwifery team are usually the main care providers throughout the early postnatal period. They will ensure that your care is tailored to meet your individual needs and will work in partnership with you and your family to ensure you can make informed decisions about your baby's care. Visits are arranged at home or at clinics in the local community. Care is provided by the midwifery team for a minimum of 10 days or up to 28 days following the birth, as required. The frequency and location of visits will be decided between you and your midwife. 24 hour support is available from the midwifery service and you will be given all the information to access that support if required. Your midwife also works in partnership with other health professionals and can refer your baby to the appropriate specialist. 50 Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy CareHealth visitor Health visitors work within the NHS. All are qualified nurses or midwives who have done additional training in family and child health, health promotion and public health development work. They work as part of a team alongside your GP and other community nurses such as practice nurses, school nurses, as well as midwives. Your health visitor will visit you at home, around 10 - 14 days after you have had your baby. Subsequent contacts can then take place either at home, the local health centre, surgery or in the local community. They work with families and young children and all have special expertise in the everyday challenges of parenthood. Family doctor / General Practitioner (GP) GPs are responsible for medical care, so you will need to register your baby as soon as possible after the birth. Your doctor will follow your baby's development closely through regular assessments in partnership with the midwife and health visitor. The immunisation programme which begins at 6 to 8 weeks, usually takes place at the surgery and your health visitor can give you more information about this. Specialists Some babies with medical problems from birth may need to be followed up by a neonatologist or paediatrician. If a problem arises with your baby in the postnatal period, the following are also available to help you: audiology for hearing; physiotherapy and orthopaedics for hips; and ultrasound scanning for kidney problems. Child health clinics Child health clinics are usually based in your local health centre or GP surgery. They are run on a weekly basis by your health visitor and provide information and advice on all aspects of health and baby care. Your health visitor will give you all the information about where and when these clinics are held.Child health records This will be given to you by your midwife following delivery and is the main record of your child's health, growth and development. You should therefore keep it in a safe place. You can also register for a digital (eRed book) child health record online. This ensures that you have a copy of your child's progress for your own information and also for health professionals when and where they may need it. It also records your child's height and weight, immunisations, childhood illnesses and accidents. To register for an eRedbook, visit: www.eredbook.org.uk Looking after your baby Early development Newborn babies can use all their senses. From birth your baby will focus on and follow your face when you are close in front of them. They will enjoy gentle touch and the sound of a soothing voice and will react to bright light and be startled by sudden, loud noises. By two weeks of age, babies begin to recognise their parents and by 4 to 6 weeks start to smile. Interacting with your baby through talking, smiling and singing to them are all ways of helping your baby feel loved and secure. Safe sleep To prevent Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), your baby should be placed on a firm, flat mattress with a waterproof cover. Baby's feet need to be touching the bottom of the cot; this is known as the 'feet to foot' position. The cot should be clear; bumpers, toys, loose bending rods, pods and nests increase the risk of SIDS. Your baby should sleep in the same room as you for 6 months. If you or your partner smoke before or after baby is born, risks of SIDS increase. Breastfeeding can reduce the risk of SIDS. Some parents choose to share a bed with their baby. It is important for you to know how to do this safely. Please refer to the Lullaby Trust guidance, as for some babies 'bed sharing' is too dangerous. You must also never sleep on a sofa or armchair with your baby, as this too increases the risks of SIDS. Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy Care your baby at night - safe sleep guidance For the first 6 months the safest place for your baby to sleep is in a cot by the side of your bed. This means you can hear your baby and respond to their needs before they start crying or becoming distressed, and reach them easily without having to get up. It is both normal and essential for your baby to feed during the night. Babies grow quickly in the early weeks and months of their lives and have very small stomachs. Therefore they need to feed around the clock to meet their needs. It is not safe to doze off with your baby on a sofa or armchair, therefore some parents choose to create a safe space to feed their baby in bed and some fall asleep with their baby during the night while feeding and comforting whether they intend to or not. Therefore it is very important to consider the following points: Keep your baby away from the pillows. Make sure your baby cannot fall out of bed or become trapped between the mattress and wall. Make sure the bedclothes cannot cover your baby's face or head. Don't leave your baby alone in the bed, as even very young babies can wriggle into a dangerous position.BEWARE it is not safe to share your bed with your baby if: Your baby was born very small or preterm. When you have been drinking any alcohol or taking drugs that may cause drowsiness (legal or illegal). If you or anyone else sharing the bed is a smoker. For more information see: 'Caring for Trust: www.lullabytrust.org.uk/safer-sleep-advice Ways to wake a sleepy baby If there are concerns about how long your baby has slept, gently rouse your baby by providing tactile stimulation, such as changing their nappy, massaging hands and feet, rubbing their back or walking your fingers up and down his or her spine. Your baby can also be placed in skin-to-skin contact (see page 48). Kangaroo care Similar to skin to skin, dressed only in a nappy, the baby is held against your chest between your breasts, snug inside your clothing, often for hours. Partners can do this too. Advantages include more stable breathing, heart rate and temperature; less crying; better weight gain; and increased milk supply. Ways to settle a crying baby Offer a feed. Put your baby next to your skin (skin-to-skin). Wrap in a blanket so your baby feels warm and secure. Your baby may respond to being cuddled or stroked in a warm bath.

Walking is good for both of you. It may be easiest to take a young baby in a sling. If you use a buggy, make sure your baby can lie flat on his or her back. In a car It is illegal for anyone to hold a baby while sitting in the back or front seat of a car. The only safe way for your baby to travel in a car is in a properly secured, backward-facing baby seat, or in a carry cot (not a Moses basket) with the cover on and secured with special straps. If you have a car with air bags in the front, your baby should not travel in the front seat (even facing backwards) because of the danger of suffocation if the bag inflates. For more information: www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and- baby/child-car-seats-and-child-car-safety/ In cold weather Make sure your baby is wrapped up warm in cold weather because babies get cold very easily. Take the extra clothing off when you get into a warm place, including the car, so that your baby does not overheat, even if he or she is asleep. In hot weather Babies and children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of the sun, as their skin is thinner and they may not be able to produce enough pigment called melanin to protect them from sunburn. The amount of sun your child is exposed to may increase his or her risk of skin cancer in later life. Keep babies under six months old out of the sun altogether, by making the most of the shade such as trees, or using a sunshade attached to the pram, and dressing them in loose baggy clothing. Let your child wear a floppy hat with a wide brim or a 'legionnaire's hat' that shades the face and neck. During summer, cover exposed parts of skin with a sunscreen, even on cloudy or overcast days. Use one with a sun protection factor (SPF) 30 or above and which is effective against UVA and UVB. Re-apply often. Safety in the home Children most at risk of a home accident are in the 0 - 4 age group. Speak to your health visitor for information on practical issues such as fitting smoke detectors and how to keep your baby safe generally. It is advised not to smoke within the home. For more information: www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and- baby/baby-safety-tips/ Vitamin K Everybody needs Vitamin K to help their blood to clot. Babies are naturally born with low levels of Vitamin K, which is normal. However, very rarely this can lead to Vitamin K Deficiency bleeding (VKDB). To reduce this chance of bleeding, the Department of Health recommends that all newborn babies are given vitamin K at birth. There are two methods to give your baby Vitamin K: 1. By injection - one dose is given at birth. This is the method recommended by the Department of Health. 2. By mouth - two doses need to be given in the first week of life, one at birth and at day five of life. Babies that are exclusively breastfeeding will need a third dose at 28 days of life. This dose is given by either you, or your health care professional. Vitamin D It is recommended that all breast fed babies are offered vitamin D supplementation from birth.

Your midwife will complete an initial examination of your baby immediately after the birth. The first detailed examination however, will take place within 72 hours by a specially trained midwife, nurse or doctor. The examination includes eyes, heart and lung sounds, nervous system, abdomen and hips. Your participation in this process is welcome and any concerns you have can be identified and discussed. The second detailed examination will be done by your GP or health visitor when your baby is 6 to 8 weeks old. If any problems are identified during either of these examinations or at any time in between, your baby will be referred to the appropriate specialist baby doctor, such as a paediatrician or neonatologist. The checking of your baby's well-being is a continual process, however, and each time your baby is seen by your health visitor, a detailed review of growth and development is undertaken as well as a physical assessment. Consequently the progress of your baby is documented, which enables early identification of any problems, so that appropriate management and referral can be arranged. All findings will be discussed with you in detail. Newborn hearing screen A small number of babies (1 - 2 in every 1000) are born with hearing loss. A quick screening test can be done, usually before you leave the hospital, to identify those babies with hearing loss, so that support and information can be given to you at an early stage. In some areas, the newborn hearing screen may be done at home, or at a local surgery or health clinic in the first few weeks of life. Your midwife will be able to tell you where and when the test is likely to happen and will give you a leaflet with more information. For more information: www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and- baby/newborn-hearing-test/Blood spot test All babies are offered a simple blood test on day 5 to find the very few who may be affected by the following genetic and metabolic disorders: congenital hypothyroidism. cystic phenylketonuria. MCADD (Medium Chain acyl-coA Dehydrogenase aciduria type 1 (GAI). homocystinuria (pyridoxine unresponsive) (HCU). Babies with these disorders can then be given early treatment to prevent serious problems. These disorders would not otherwise be diagnosed in the newborn baby, even after careful examination by a doctor. These conditions are covered in more detail in the leaflet 'Screening tests for you and your baby.' Your midwife or maternity support worker will take a small sample of blood from your baby's heel onto a card usually between the 5th and 8th postnatal day (ideally on day 5). This is then sent to a laboratory for testing. The heel prick will only cause a moment of discomfort which your baby will soon forget. Repeat tests are sometimes necessary for various reasons: there may not have been enough blood taken at the first test; the specimen may have been damaged or contaminated; a problem may have occurred with laboratory testing and no result obtained; or there may be a 'borderline' or unclear result. If your baby was born before 36 weeks or received a blood transfusion, a repeat test will be arranged. There are several reasons for an unclear result and the repeat test is often completely normal. If the repeat test is still unclear, arrangements will be made for your baby to see a paediatrician. 54 Kingston Maternity | Your Pregnancy CareObtaining the results The results are usually ready within one working week and your health visitor will record them on your child's record. A positive result The vast majority of results are negative. However, if your baby has one of these disorders, arrangements will be made for you to see a specialist team experienced in managing these disorders. Your GP will also be contacted. For more information: www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and- baby/newborn-screening/Early immunisations BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) This is a vaccine offered to babies who may be at risk from contact with TB (tuberculosis). Those at higher than average risk are travellers and the homeless, but also people who have arrived in the UK from Asia, Africa, South and Central America and Eastern Europe. TB is a potentially serious infection, which usually affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. The BCG vaccination is usually given to the baby early in the postnatal period. Ideally it should be given before the age of two months. For more information: www.gov.uk/government/publications/tb- bcg-and-your-baby-leaflet Hepatitis B Some people carry the hepatitis B virus in their blood without actually having the disease itself. If a pregnant mother has hepatitis B, or catches it during pregnancy, she can pass it on to her baby. The baby may not be ill but has a high chance of becoming a carrier and developing liver disease in later life. Babies born to infected mothers should receive a course of vaccines. The first dose is given within 24 hours of birth, and two more doses are given at one and two months with a booster dose at twelve months old.
