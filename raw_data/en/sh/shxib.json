Many factors such as hormonal imbalance, mental state, diet and lifestyle contribute to these menstrual problems. Menorrhagia is the technical term for prolonged uterine bleeding. Uncontrolled uterine bleeding or excessive menstrual bleeding is also termed by this name in few of the instances. In Ayurvedic texts, it is named as Raktapradara or Asrigdara. 'Asrik' means blood and 'dara' refers to excessive flow. Table of Contents Causative factors Causative / worsening factors for Menorrhagia (heavy periods) include - Excessive fasting - Fasting for a very long period of time causes an increase of Vata and Pitta Doshas. The same two Doshas are related to menorrhagia. Excess of sexual indulgence - leads to Vata Dosha increase Intake of spicy food - leads to Pitta dosha increase Intake of food containing deep penetrative nature like garlic, asafoetida, mustard etc Heavy exercise Stress and tension etc For the above reasons, the above activities are contra-indicated in people with heavy periods. Origin of Menorrhagia (Asrigdara) Due to the above said unwholesome diet and habits, both raktadhatu and Pitta doshas are vitiated. It leads to heavy periods, fatigue, back pain etc symptoms. Symptoms of Asrigdara The symptoms can be divided into four sets based on the Vitiated Dosha Vataja Asrigdara: Pain, frothy bleeding like the flower of palasha is found. Pittaja Asrigdara: The bleeding will be blackish red, warm and associated with fever. Kaphaja Asrigdara: Pallor, slimy, thick, stable( long-lasting) bleeding is observed in case of kaphaja asrigdara. Sannipataja Asrigdara: It is associated with syncope and fever and mixed symptoms of all the three doshas; It is very difficult to treat. Treatment of Asrigdara Treatment to balance down Pitta dosha and Rakta (blood tissue) [Stambhana - blocking therapy](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2014/10/18/stambhana-therapy-blocking-ayurvedic-treatment-principle/)- is adopted.

MD (Ay) & Dr Manasa, B.A.M.S Pradara - Definition, Causes, Pathogenesis, Types, Symptoms, Treatment Asrgdara and pradara which are often used as synonyms of each other are types of menstrual disorders presenting with excessive bleeding. This condition is not included among the eight types of menstrual disorders i.e. [artava](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2018/11/29/artava-menstrual-blood/) vyapad, but fall under the umbrella of the same. Read - [Physiology Of Menstruation, Menstrual Cycle - Ayurvedic Perspective](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2018/11/29/menstruation-menstrual-cycle/) Definition of Pradara / Asrgdara Due to pradirana i.e. excessive excretion of raja i.e. menstrual blood it is named as pradara. Since there is dirana i.e. excessive discharge of asrk i.e. menstrual blood, it is called as asrgdara. The above said definitions of both pradara and asrgdara look to have similar meaning. Both define excessive excretion / elimination / discharge of blood from vagina. Read - [Vaginal White Discharge (Leucorrhea) Ayurvedic Treatment, Home Remedies](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2014/12/02/vaginal-white-discharge-ayurvedic-treatment-home-remedies/) Understanding Asrgdara / pradara From the definition of pradara / asrgdara, these conditions look similar to a condition explained by modern medicine i.e. menorrhagia. 1. While looking into the Ayurvedic pathogenesis of pradara, Charaka and Chakrapani, Charaka Samhita opine that when increased rakta i.e. blood gets admixed with raja i.e. menstrual blood, the quantity of menstrual blood increases, thus causing asrgdara / pradara. Read - [Somaroga - Excessive Female Discharge With Loss Of Vitality](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2014/12/02/somaroga-excessive-female-discharge-loss-vitality/) 2. Dalhana, the commentator of Sushruta Samhita tells that asrgdara is a condition characterised by two or more of the below mentioned conditions - - Excessive bleeding during menstruation - Prolonged menstruation period - Bleeding during inter-menstrual period Vagbhata is also of the same opinion and includes bleeding during both menstrual and inter-menstrual phases. 3. Chakrapani, in the context of explaining Vataja etc doshic types of yoni vyapad i.e. vaginal disorders, has specified that these conditions resemble vataja etc specific types of asrgdara and manifest inter-menstrual bleeding also. Thus, Chakrapani includes inter-menstrual bleeding in doshic types of asrgdara too.

But on the basis of pathogenesis, asrgdara can be closely correlated to menorrhagia or polymenorrhagia. - [Ayurvedic Diet And Lifestyle During Menstruation (Periods)](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2019/01/11/diet-lifestyle-menstruation-ayurveda/) Causative factors of Asrgdara - Excessive consumption of salty, sour, pungent, heavy, corrosive and unctuous foods. - Excessive consumption of meat of domestic, aquatic and fatty animals - Excessive consumption of krsara i.e. olio prepared with rice and pulses, payasa i.e. sweetened rice prepared in rice base, [curds](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2010/12/31/curds-benefits/), vinegar, curd water and wine Pathogenesis of asrgdara 1. According to Charaka When the woman consumes the above mentioned food in excess, her vata aggravated by its own causes or due to it being surrounded by pitta, withholds blood which also gets vitiated due to the above said causes. The vata further increases the amount of blood. Read - [Gynecological Disorders Causes, Types As Per Ayurveda](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2018/11/22/causes-gynecological-disorder/) Along with the increased blood, the vitiated vata reaches the raja carrying vessels i.e. branches of uterine and ovarian arteries. Here it immediately increases the amount of rajas i.e. menstrual blood by adding the increased blood to the menstrual blood. Thus, the menstrual blood gets increased in quantity when the increased blood gets added to it in the ovarian and uterine vessels of the uterus. This increase in menstrual blood is due to relative increase of rasa i.e. plasma contents. Because of increase in the amount of blood, the experts call this disease as asrgdara. Since in this condition, excessive blood is discharged, it is also called as pradara.

According to Harita In an infertile woman, the milk carrying channels are filled with vata. As a result, she has absence of milk secretion and she also suffers from excessive menstrual bleeding.

According to Bhela If the body blood goes to abnormal passages, the woman suffers from pradara. Other causative factors (Madhava Nidana, Bhavaprakasha, Yogaratnakara) - Use of incompatible diet and wine - Eating before the previous food has been digested - Indigestion - Abortion - Excessive coitus - Riding - Walking - Grief - Emaciation - Weight lifting - Trauma [Day-sleeping](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2011/02/21/day-sleep-sleeping-in-the-day-good-or-bad-ayurveda-details/)etc. What else is asrgdara / pradara? Asrgdara / pradara is also said to be - - Shonita janya vyadhi - one of the disorders of blood (Charaka, Sushruta) [Rakta pradoshaja roga](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2018/09/06/blood-dosha-ama/)- one of the disorders caused due to contamination of blood by doshas (Charaka, Kashyapa) - Pittavruta [Apana Vayu](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2018/12/03/apana-vata/)lakshana - one of the symptoms of functions apana vata being ativriddhi lakshana - one of the symptoms caused due to abnormal increase in quantity of blood (Vagbhata, Bhavaprakasha) - Yoni roga upadrava - Pitta ati vruddhi lakshana - asrgdara is also manifested due to increase in pitta (Dalhana) Read - [Pitta Increase Symptoms - Pitta Vriddhi Lakshana](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2013/07/11/how-to-observe-pitta-dosha-imbalance-symptoms-in-your-body-by-yourself/) Classification of Asrgdara 1. 4 types of - - Vataja asrgdara - caused by by Sannipataja asrgdara - caused by simultaneous vitiation of all three doshas 2. Asrgdara caused by dual vitiation of doshas - Master Charaka, after enumerating above said four types of asrgdara, has explained the treatment of pitta-vataja asrgdara i.e. menorrhagia caused by dual vitiation of pitta and vata. Thus, Charaka has accepted the possibility of clinical manifestations of menorrhagia caused due to dual vitiation of doshas. Read - [Vatala Yoni Vyapad - Causes, Symptoms, Treatment](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2018/11/22/vatala-yoni-vyapad-causes-symptoms-treatment/) To add to this, commentators Dalhana and Indu have accepted 7 types of asrgdara among which three are caused due to dual vitiation of doshas. They are - - Vataja - Pittaja Kaphaja Vata-pittaja / 3. Shleshmaja Asrgdara is counted as the first sub-type - Pattern of counting the sub-types of any disease starts from vataja, followed by pittaja and kaphaja. In Madhava Nidana, Bhavaprakasha and Yogaratnakara treatises, chronology is broken. They have first mentioned Shleshmaja menorrhagia first, followed by pittaja and then vataja menorrhagia. Madhukosha commentary clarifies that this chronology has been followed and shleshmaja menorrhagia is first to emphasize the presence of pain in kaphaja subtype of menorrhagia too. Read - [Functions Of Doshas In Balance In The Body - Prakrita Dosha Karma](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2018/08/21/doshas-balance-functions/) Generally we see that pain is more in vataja and pittaja whereas in shleshmaja / kaphaja sub-types of any disease, pain or discomfort will be negligible or absent. In Bhavaprakasha it is said that kaphaja menorrhagia is mentioned first because relatively more bleeding occurs in this condition. 4. No classification but acceptance of types of asrgdara by Sushruta Master Sushruta has not given the classification of Asrgdara. But while explaining signs and symptoms of this disease, Sushruta mentions 'all types of asrgdara'. This clarifies that Sushruta, in spite of not giving the names of types of menorrhagia, has accepted that there are variants of this disease. He has further emphasised to treat asrgdara on the lines of treating raktapitta, a bleeding disorder caused by vitiated blood and pitta. Here, Sushruta emphasises that the predominance of dosha should be diagnosed by carefully observing specific features of dosha(s) in the discharged blood. This explanation also gives us an insight of Sushruta accepting doshic types of menorrhagia. Read - [Role of In the Causation of Disease](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2018/07/27/doshas-disease/) 5. Raktayoni and Asrgdara are similar conditions - Vagbhata According to Vagbhata, raktayoni, a vaginal disorder and asrgdara are alike conditions. He has further given treatment of vataja, pittaja and kaphaja asrgdara, though not enumerating the names of types of menorrhagia, has accepted three types by advocating the treatments for the mentioned subtypes. He has advised to give importance to the color of discharged blood while prescribing the treatment for raktayoni. General signs and symptoms of asrgdara 1. Local symptoms pertaining to vagina and uterus Presence of excessive bleeding during menstruation Bleeding during menstruation in excessive quantity and for prolonged time associated with bleeding in the inter-menstrual period in scanty proportions and for a short duration. The bleeding is different from the features of normal menstrual blood and would reflect the features of doshas depicting their involvement in causation of this disorder. Each dosha sub-type of menorrhagia will have different set of signs and symptoms depending on predominant dosha(s) involved in the pathogenesis. 2. Generalised symptoms [Burning sensation](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2014/06/24/burning-sensation-ayurvedic-understanding-treatment/)in lower groin, pelvic region, back, region of kidney and flanks - Pain in uterus - Body ache - Pain Prognosis of asrgdara Menorrhagia caused by simultaneous vitiation of all three doshas is said to be incurable.

Master Harita tells that the woman suffering from fever, having very short inter-menstrual period and continuous bleeding is incurable while describing the features of incurability of menstrual blood i.e. arishta lakshanas.
