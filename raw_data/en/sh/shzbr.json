All three outside directors are independent appointments who understand SHIONOGI's corporate responsibility, and they contribute to greater trans- parency in management. In addition, two of the five directors are women. The Board of Directors meeting is chaired by an outside director and in principle held once a month. 2 Board of Auditors /Board of Auditors meeting To ensure that the directors and each organization in SHIONOGI conduct their duties in a legally compliant and appropriate manner, the Company has established systems to enable members of the Board of Auditors and the Internal Control Department, which is responsible for conducting inter - nal audits, to carry out audits and exchange opinions with the representative directors to take necessary measures. The Board of Auditors consists of two standing members and three out- side auditors. The members of the Board of Auditors attend meetings of key management bodies, such as the Board of Directors and the Corporate Executive Management Meeting, providing their opinions as necessary. Also, in accordance with corporate auditing standards, members of the Board of Audi- tors conduct business and accounting audits to verify the legality and validity of the duties carried out by the directors and corporate officers responsible for business execution. They also receive reports from the Internal Control Department and the independent accounting auditors and exchange opinions. 3 Business execution framework SHIONOGI has introduced an executive officer system to sup- port dynamic and flexible business operations, enabling the Group to respond rapidly to significant changes in the operat- ing environment. SHIONOGI has established the Corporate Executive Management Meeting, which is attended by direc- tors, standing corporate auditors, and parties responsible for business execution, and the meeting is generally held once a week. At the meeting, there is exhaustive deliberations on topics ranging from items concerning the execution of duties to important management matters. Business is executed within a system in which each of the ten divisions are under one of four supervisory units\u2014the R&D Supervisory Unit, Healthcare Business Supervisory Unit, Supply Supervisory Unit, and Corporate Supervisory Unit. When executing business, issues are fully deliberated on at the Corporate Executive Management Meeting, and the Board of Directors makes decision regarding issues that impact management.

In fiscal 2022, we have revised the SHIONOGI Group Enterprise Risk Management Policy, aiming to foster a risk culture and further strengthen our resilience through strategic management of both offensive and defensive risks. SHIONOGI is committed to the appropriate management of business risks, including the creation of business opportunities and the avoidance and mitigation of risks, and has established an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) system to oversee risks throughout the Group as an important mechanism for man- agement strategy and management infrastructure, which we are striving to promote. A fundamental of the SHIONOGI Group is to have each organization identify risks associated with its decision making and business execution and then take the initiative to manage and deal with those risks. In particular, the Corporate Executive Management Meeting and the Board of Directors deliberate and make decisions on policies for responding to significant risks that could have an impact on management, and based on the response policy, the supervis- ing department works with the related organizations to imple- ment these measures. In addition, the Internal Control Department, which is the internal audit division, conducts independent verification in accordance with the \"Basic Policy for Construction and Operation of Internal Control System\". In line with the revision of the \"SHIONOGI Group Risk Man- agement Policy,\" we revised our crisis management-related regulations and established a management system that includes a Business Continuity Plan (BCP). In the event of a crisis, we will promote management focused on respect for human life, consideration for and contribution to local com- munities, and prevention of damage to corporate value, and strive to quickly overcome the crisis by taking prompt action. Since fiscal 2021, we have been taking steps to build an IT-BCP , identifying critical systems with high recovery priority and revising rules that stipulate procedures for IT recovery in the event of a cyber incident. In fiscal 2022, we will conduct a BCP drill assuming an earthquake in the Nankai Trough for management to verify the system and procedures, and test the effectiveness of related rules and regulations. Furthermore, an incident is defined as \"a negative event caused by SHIONOGI's action or omission,\" and we have a system in place so that when an event occurs that may affect management, information is promptly communicated to the Crisis Management Manager, the executive officer in charge, the CRO, and the President, who responds in cooperation with the person in charge of the department or office where the incident occurred. To create an organizational culture to achieve such a system, we are working to foster a culture of \"Bad News First,\" in which negative information is reported more promptly than positive information, in coordination with the Group-wide compliance measures.Promotion of risk management system Crisis Management and Incident Management/L54707/L54706 Board of Directors Chief Executive Officer Corporate Executive Management Meeting Important matters related to Enterprise Risk Management (Enterprise Risk Management Systems, Policies, and important risks) /L54708 Officer in charge of Enterprise Risk Management /L54710 The Company's executive officers and the SHIONOGI Group company presidents Business unit SHIONOGI Group company Management of risks in business executionDiscussion and approval Monitoring and opera- tional supportSupervision and advice Proposal and reporting ReportingReporting Centralized management of the SHIONOGI Group risks Ascertaining status of action against important risks Annual reporting Proposals of candidate important risks, allocation of management resources, etc.P P A A D D C C/L54709 Enterprise Risk Management SecretariatRole /L54706Board of Directors Provides supervision, advice, etc. on the planning, progress, and results of ERM promotion activities /L54707Chief Executive Officer, Corporate Executive MeetingThe Corporate Executive Meeting, chaired by the Representative Director, President discusses import- ant matters concerning SHIONOGI's ERM, which are approved by the Representative Director, President /L54708Officer in charge of Enterprise Risk ManagementThe Corporate Supervisor is Chief Risk Management Officer (CRO), overseeing SHIONOGI's risk manage- ment and assuming responsibility for the promotion and operation of the ERM system. /L54709Enterprise Risk Management SecretariatThe enterprise risk management secretariat consists of the Sustainability Management Department, the General Administration Department, and the Cor - porate Planning Department. /L54710The Company's executive officers and the SHIONOGI Group company presidentsEach business unit and Group company is responsi- ble for the execution of risk management in the execution of its operations/L50237 Risk management structure 87 Shionogi & Co., Ltd.
