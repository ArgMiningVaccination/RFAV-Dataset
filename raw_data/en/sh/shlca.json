Most symptoms start within the first 12 hours after the shot was given. Redness and fever starting on day 1 or 2 of the shot is always normal. - All of these reactions mean the vaccine is working. - Your child's body is making new antibodies to protect against the real disease. - Most of these symptoms will only last 2 or 3 days. - There is no need to see your doctor for normal reactions, such as redness or fever. - Here is some care advice that should help. - Vaccine Site Reaction: Treatment - Some pain, swelling and skin redness at the injection site is normal. It means the vaccine is working. - Massage: gently massage the injection site 3 or more times a day. - Heat: for pain or redness, apply a heating pad or a warm wet washcloth to the area for 10 minutes. Repeat as needed. Reason: will increase blood flow to the area. May apply cold if you prefer, but avoid ice. - No Pain Medicine: try not to give any pain medicines. Reason: pain medicines may reduce the body's normal immune response. Use local heat instead. Pain rarely becomes bad. If needed, use acetaminophen. - Hives at the Shot Site: if itchy, can put on 1% hydrocortisone cream (such as Cortaid). No prescription is needed. Use twice daily as needed. - Fever with Vaccines: Treatment - Fever with vaccines is normal, harmless and probably helpful. Reason: fever speeds up your body's immune system. - Fever with most vaccines begins within 12 hours and lasts 1 to 2 days. - For low grade fevers of 100-102\u00b0 F (37.8 to 39\u00b0 C), do not give fever medicines. Reason: they may reduce your body's normal immune response. - For fevers above 102\u00b0 F (39\u00b0 C), medicine may be given for discomfort. If needed, use acetaminophen. - Fluids. Encourage cool fluids in unlimited amounts. Reason: prevent dehydration. Fluids can also lower high fevers. For infants age younger than 6 months, only give formula or breastmilk. - Clothing. Dress in normal clothing. For shivering or the chills, use a blanket until it stops. - General Symptoms From Vaccines: - All vaccines can cause mild fussiness, crying and restless sleep. This is usually due to a sore shot site. - Some children sleep more than usual. A decreased appetite and activity level are also common. - These symptoms are normal.
