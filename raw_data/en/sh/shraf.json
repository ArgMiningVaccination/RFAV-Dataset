The number of new institutions being announced and plans being made is mind-boggling compared to the sparse fare of the past. The National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) is a small, relatively insulated, institution that has grown slowly, adding a few carefully chosen groups each year. Should we join the expedition and risk sinking or lie low and simply miss the boat? The critics of change, and there are many, have a point. When they view the transformations taking place they uniformly ask: Where are the people who will lead this change, where are the scientists who will staff all the new places coming up? In any given area, they argue, India has but a handful of researchers. To grow too fast, do the wrong things or to spread one's time and effort too thin is suicidal. on the other hand, others argue that it will be suicidal not to grasp the opportunities for growth and change that are available now, that it is part of the adventure to nurture and find the human resources (as people are nowadays called) for the task. It is rather interesting to have alternative ways of suicide as one's only choices! In the event, this is a good time to look at NCBS's past and discuss what we should do in interacting with our environment. There are many responsibilities we could take and these come with opportunities and potential problems. We need to see through the fog if we are to avoid the rocks of trying things the wrong way, trying too many things, trying the wrong things or, equally risky, trying nothing. over the sixteen years since NCBS's birth and growth to about 25 groups, its simple core values have been its strength. These include a rigorous tenure-track system and the academic freedom to take one's science forward without having directions imposed. We have chosen to hire the best and have not grown by excluding some areas or focusing on others. our research areas range from the study of the physics and chemistry of macromolecules to ecological sciences. This breadth and, crucially, the diverse student and postdoctoral community that it brings with it, have created an environment that is stimulating, creative, irreverent, questioning and one that is constantly renewed. These features Driving, and responding to, change NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 4 7/10/08 5:31:56 PM5SATYAJIT m AYor are necessary, but are not sufficient explanation for past successes or for assuring future ones. All of what is good about NCBS today is also a consequence of our perception of a few years ago on how to recognize 'good' science. These perceptions should not be a constant: If we were to retain today the perceptions of yesterday in making our choices for the future we are very likely to make serious mistakes. The way we have started and grown has allowed us to become good. To become excellent, simply having more of the same will not work, except to retain the ability to choose in the context of what is currently the best anywhere. What do we need to do to position us for success in the coming fifteen years? There are tantalizing possibilities. our forthcoming new laboratories allow us to expand our Young Investigator Programme with the aim to nurture a population of dynamic and constantly renewed researchers. Till now, we had little choice but to have these talented people find themselves a longer-term home at the end of their tenure. The growth of new institutions in India now allows them to cast their net wider. NCBS hopes to interact with these new institutions to formally embed interactions that allow movement of investigators. Closer to home, the entry into Bangalore of the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) in a direct manner offers a range of new possibilities: The DBT is starting a new stem-cell institute (SCI) close to NCBS and we have been asked to incubate this laboratory and define the nature of our interactions in a memorandum of association. If formulated well and implemented better, this affords an unprecedented opportunity for symbiosis leading to the development of a critical mass of very high quality life sciences researchers in Bangalore. The DBT is keen that the SCI, in addition to its mandate, serve as a home for several satellite centres whose focus will be by no means limited to stem cell research. Interacting in this venture thus provides both NCBS and SCI with invigorating possibilities in all of biology: We can share intellectual and material resources and we can increase the size, diversity and capability of our community while constantly improving quality. This allows us to address scientific problems in new ways and develop a niche advantage or an approach that allows us to be truly innovative. In addition to working to develop these new institutional structures in a variety of ways, NCBS has the opportunity to expand on two of its relatively newer strengths: We director's report NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 5 7/10/08 5:31:57 PMhave been fortunate to have developed an excellent band of theoreticians and experimentalists who use physics, chemistry and computational approaches to study biology. Another group has emerged in what can be broadly called ecological sciences and conservation biology. It is clear that these groupings are poised to attract even more excellent researchers. It is just this sort of growth - in an environment of cell and molecular biology - that can open the possibilities of transformation into excellence. As always, the generalities of discussion about the future need to be moored in the reality of what we practice. Since our last report we had many changes in our research groups. V. Sriram joins the Department of Biological Sciences (DBS) at TIFr as a faculty member. Sriram's success as a young investigator and his recruitment by DBS is exemplary and we hope the Young Investigator Programme will grow and populate more places with such excellent researchers. Kaustubh rau, another Young Investigator, has decided to leap into a start-up company. This is the kind of move which will inspire many talented young scientists as entrepreneurship is stimulated and grows in our environment. We welcome Deepak Nair and Sanjay Sane who both study the relationship between structure and function, albeit at very diverse scales and in very different ways. mukund Thattai has metamorphosed from Young Investigator to faculty member. mahesh Sankaran, who studies the mechanism that governs changing ecosystems, joins us from Leeds later this year. A very warm welcome to all and a fond farewell to Sriram and Kaustubh. Finally, the answer to the question in the first paragraph is simple: If we set sail in a vessel with a good hull and a team that can handle fair weather and foul, we can contribute to, and be part of, a great expedition without sinking and becoming history. NCBS seems fully capable of doing just this (the former, not the latter)! In any event, with marine metaphors abounding, we perhaps need a marine station too: Any takers to start one? k. | 20 | 24 Kaustubh R. Rau R. Thattai Jayant NCBS_AR_05_07.indd nucleic acidsYAMUNA KRISHNAN Bionanotechnology aims to learn from nature - to understand the structure and function of biological devices and to utilise nature's solutions in advancing science and engineering. Evolution has produced an overwhelming number and variety of biological devices that function at the nanoscale or molecular level. my laboratory's central theme is one of 'translational biology', which involves taking a biological device, component or concept out of its cellular context and harnessing its function in a completely new setting such as in materials or diagnostics. our current research involves understanding the structure and dynamics of unusual forms of DNA and translating this knowledge to create DNA-based nanodevices for applications in bionanotechnology. Structural DNA nanotechnology is an emerging field that uses the base-complementarity design principle of DNA to create ordered superstructures from a set of DNA sequences that self-assemble into regular, well-defined topologies on the nanoscale. With a diameter of 2 nm and a helical periodicity of 3.5 nm, the DNA double helix is inherently a nanoscale object. The specificity of Watson-Crick base pairing endows oligonucleotides with unique and predictable recognition capabilities. This makes DNA an ideal nanoscale construction material. Understanding and thereby controlling structure and dynamics in DNA is thus key to realizing its potential as a nanoscale building block for device applications of structural DNA nanotechnology. These DNA nanodevices may function as rigid scaffolds in 1D, 2D or 3D. They could also function as switches or transducers, undergoing controlled nanomechanical motion, by exhibiting a conformational change in response to a stimulus. We create such DNA-based nanodevices for both materials applications as well as high-performance 'custom' biosensors that intercept biochemical signals, thereby interrogating and reporting on cellular processes such as endocytosis.Ghodke, H. B., Krishnan, R., Vignesh, K., Kumar, Y. (2007).

First Blueprint, now Bricks - DNA as construction material on the nanoscale. Chemical Society Reviews, 35, 1111-1121. structural dna nanotechnology: B-dna is used as a rigid rod on the nanoscale to construct architectures of well-defined topology in 1d, 2d 3d. acid structure formed from C-rich sequences and consists of two parallel stranded duplexes formed from hemi-protonated cytosines that intercalate (Figure 1). one of the prevailing issues regarding DNA i-motifs has been in understanding why intercalation should occur at all. In a natural DNA i-motif, duplex intercalation results in a remarkably narrow groove that positions two negatively charged DNA backbones extremely close, resulting in greater electrostatic repulsion. Sugar-sugar contacts along the backbones of both strands that flank the narrow grooves of the i-motif have been implicated in tetramer stabilization although evidence for the contrary also exists. We have shown that hybrid i-motifs are an excellent platform to probe interactions in the narrow groove. It is the only method that can identify molecular interactions that promote or 'positively regulate' i-motif formation. All other methods have identified only destabilisers of i-motifs. our work has shown that (i) sugar-sugar contacts in i-motifs are not a consequence of, but possibly drive tetramerization (ii) 2'oH steric clash in the narrow groove is not as destabilizing as perceived (iii) i-motif intercalation topology is highly sensitive to narrow groove interactions and (iv) there is a subtle specificity encoded even in the sugar-sugar contacts. 2 an i-motif based dna nanoswitch ph and Souvik ModiWe have used the i-motif as a means to bring about large scale conformational changes in designed nucleic acid assemblies to make nanoswitches. This DNA nanodevice has an in-built mechanism for i-motif formation, activated by a proton input that creates a force that compels the device to undergo a large scale conformational change, thus functioning as a proton-sensitive switch. The real-time performance of the nanoswitch as a sensor for mapping spatio-temporal pH changes has been demonstrated in vitro and on cell surfaces. We are currently using the switch as an intracellular pH biosensor by targeting it to endocytic vesicles through the transferrin receptor pathway and mapping spatiotemporal pH changes. Should this be successful, it would be the first example of an artificially designed DNA nanomachine performing a custom task in a cellular environment. We are also investigating pH-driven conformational switches of other types of DNA-based assemblies.Collaborator: NCBSfigure 1. formed from d(c4a2). Cytosine nucleobases are indicated in blue, and the adenine bases in pink. Notice the two parallel stranded C +-C duplexes, one in grey, the other in orange, intercalating to yield two wide grooves and two highly narrow minor grooves.

Using a bottom up approach of self assembling C-rich oligonucleotides, we have created 1D wires that are upto 3 microns long and 2 nm wide, formed from extended i-motifs that interlock, which we call I-wires (Figure 2). Their use as 1D scaffolds was demonstrated by immobilizing gold nanoparticles evidenced by TEm and SEr S. I-wires showed superior aspect ratios, thermal and surface stabilities to B-DNA illustrating the immense potential of these four-stranded building blocks in structural DNA nanotechnology. We are now investigating the persistence length of I-wires, their conductivity as well as using I-wires for materials applications as scaffolds to make plasmon wave guides.Collaborator: C.

Top schematic of gold nanoparticles encapsulated in icosahedra. 100nm 4 nanotechnology Ramya Krishnan and Shabana MehtabB-DNA has been used as a construction material on the nanoscale to make polyhedra such as cubes, tetrahedra and truncated octahedra. The underlying assumption in polyhedron construction is that each side of a polyhedron requires a unique recognition site. This has limited the realisation of more complex polyhedra due to erroneous recognition between larger numbers of supposedly unique partner sequences, which has a cascading effect. Using a radically different design paradigm that uses modular assembly of repeating components, we have constructed the most complex DNA-based platonic solid built to date and shown that these polyhedra can encapsulate gold nanoparticles from solution (Figure 3). We are now investigating release kinetics of encapsulated entities from such DNA polyhedra for drug delivery applications.Collaborator: Shantinath S. Indi, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 5 tertiary structure of non-coding rna Shabana Mehtab The long term interests of the lab are to correlate rNA structure with function in the context of rNA mediated gene-regulation. Given the current expertise in probe-hybridization based methods to address solution rNA structure, we are now developing biochemical and molecular biology methods to probe rNA secondary and tertiary structure. As an initial system to refine our methods, we are determining the secondary and tertiary structure of a 0.14 kb long non-coding rNA called vault rNA. Vaults are the largest ribonucleoprotein complex present in eukaryotic cells, comprising three proteins and one rNA component. The rNA component is thought to play a structural role, although its function is unknown. By addressing the structure of this rNA and its sites of association in vaults we hope to provide an insight into vault structure and possible function. NCBS_AR_05_07.indd of transmembrane ion channelsM.K. MATHEW The biological membrane is essentially impermeable to polar and charged solutes. This allows the cell to make separate compartments to carry out different functions. However, it also means that cells need specific proteins to transport these solutes across membranes. We study a variety of transporters in systems ranging from plants to nerve cells in an attempt to understand what these proteins look like and how their structures facilitate the functions they perform. Electrical signalling in nerves is brought about by the movement of ions across the cell membrane. We use a combination of molecular biology and electrophysiology to investigate the mechanism by which the voltage-gated K +-channel opens and closes in response to changes in transmembrane potential. Plants have evolved several mechanisms to survive salinity in the soil. In order to study the cellular basis of this tolerance we have generated suspension cell cultures from different rice cultivars. We have shown that surviving saline stress requires that cells maintain low Na + concentrations in the cytosol. This is achieved both by reducing the permeability of the cell membrane to Na+ and by the activity of transporters present in the vacuole. We have expressed an endoplasmic reticulum located Ca++ pump of plant origin in yeast. Expression of this pump enables the yeast to survive high salinity in the medium by turning on a rarely used Na+ transporter in the vacuole.Anil, V.S., Krishnamurthy, P ., Kuruvilla, S., Sucharitha, K., Thomas, G. and Mathew, M.K.

Limiting Cytosolic Na + Confers Salt Tolerance to rice Cells in Culture: A Two- Photon microscopy Study of channels Sanjeev Upadhyay Voltage-gated potassium channels are among the most intensely studied proteins today. They are tetrameric proteins with each subunit consisting of six transmembrane segments and contributing a re-entrant \"Pore-loop\" to the pore (Figure 1). Crystal structures of both 2-Transmembrane (2-T m) and 6- Tm channels together with a number of atomic level models provide a starting point to elucidate the mechanism that underlies the transduction of membrane potential changes into channel opening and closing. We had earlier observed that a leucine heptad repeat motif is highly conserved in voltage-gated channels, and that mutations in these leucines lead to unexpectedly large shifts in the voltage range of Shaker channels. We argued that such large voltage shifts implied a role in the transduction machinery and sought sites elsewhere on the protein where the leucines could interact. We have undertaken an iterative modelling and mutagenesis exercise to arrive at models for the open and closed states of the channel, and to elucidate the mechanism by which electric field-driven movements in the voltage sensor result in channel opening. In order to do this, we have first evaluated the available models and crystal structures in terms of their ability to explain the consequences of conservative substitutions of hydrophobic residues in the sensor domain. Having settled on the K V1.2 crystal structure as being close to the open state, we then modelled a closed state based on available mutagenesis data, and fine tuned the model based on additional mutagenesis. Finally, we propose a series of conformational changes leading from the closed state to an activated, but non-conducting state, followed by cooperative channel opening (Figure 2).figure 1. schematic representation of a k+- channel monomer. The fourth transmembrane segment, S4 (red), is the primary voltage-sensing unit. The S5-S 6 stretch (yellow box) contributes to the aqueous pore, with S6 forming the inner lining. Channel opening requires movement of S6. Note that the functional channel is a tetramer. figure 2. proposed mechanism of channel gating. Top panel: schematic showing S4 sensing helices in S6 pore lining helices in blue. The kink in the open state is based on published EPr data. Lower panel: Atomic models based on the K V1.2 crystal structure for the open state. Surface representation for the channel models are presented, with an overlay of the S4 and S6 helices shown as cylinders. Three states are indicated: red - Closed; Yellow - Activated; Green - open. Left panel shows the Closed to Activated transition; right panel shows the Activated to open Usman Voltage-gated K+-channels have been shown to play roles in cell proliferation and cell death as well as in development. As such, control of their surface expression is critical and several regulatory molecules participate in fine-tuning the expression and functionality of channels at the cell surface. one such regulator, KCN rG (potassium channel regulator), is a potential tumor suppressor, and has been shown to reduce whole-cell K+ currents on overexpression in tumor cell lines. This could, in principle, be brought about by reducing transcription or translation of channel protein, by limiting the amount of protein that reaches the surface or by blocking channels already at the plasma membrane. We have demonstrated that KCN rG is localized in the Endoplasmic reticulum as an oligomer. Expression of KCN rG does not affect overall amounts of channel protein in cells indicating that transcription and translation are unaffected. Nor does it affect endocytosis or exocytosis of unrelated proteins or of bulk fluid establishing the specificity of the KCN rG-K V1 regulation. KCN rG interacts with the T1 domain of KV1 family channels and retains these channels in the Er. This reduces surface expression by about a third in mammalian cells (Figure 3). Analysis of whole cell currents of channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes shows that co-expression of KCN rG results in reduction of whole-cell currents by about 30%, consistent with the reduction in surface expression. The channels that do reach the surface have biophysical properties (voltage dependence of activation and inactivation as well as rates of inactivation) that are identical to channels expressed without KCN rG (Figure 4). our data indicates that KCN rG regulates surface expression by specifically retaining K V1 channel proteins in the Er. 3 Mechanisms limiting na+ levels in the cytosol of rice cells Veena Anil We have tested the text book statement that survival of plant cells subjected to saline stress correlates with low levels of cytosolic Na +. The technology for monitoring Na+ levels in specific cell compartments non-invasively in real time is currently restricted to isolated cells and protoplasts. We have monitored figure 4. kv1.4 expressed in Xenopus oocytes. a: Voltage dependence of currents evoked on depolarizing expressing KV1.4 channels with or without KCN rG. b: Voltage dependence of channel opening for the same data set. figure 3. surface expression of kv1.4 channel protein. The protein was tagged with YFP and the yellow colour indicates total protein in the cell. A myc tag was introduced in an extracellular loop. Anti-myc antibodies label protein on the surface and is shown in red. Top panel: K V1.4 co-expressed using two-photon microscopy to establish that the dye is localized exclusively in the cytosol (Figure 5). We have contrasted suspension cells derived from the sensitive rice cultivar Jaya to those from the salt-tolerant Pokkali. We find that Pokkali cells maintain low cytosolic Na+ even when medium Na+ is raised to 250 mm, whereas Jaya is unable to do so (Figure 5). We have, for the first time, manipulated cytosolic Na+ levels and demonstrated that survival of rice cells in suspension culture is inversely correlated with this parameter, over a range of cytosolic Na + concentrations spanning two orders of magnitude (Figure 6). This finding holds for both Jaya and Pokkali cells indicating that differences in their tolerance to salt is determined in large part by their ability to regulate cytosolic Na +. We have estimated the plasma membrane permeability to Na+ and find that while Jaya cells have a permeability in the range reported for other glycophytes, that of Pokkali is over an order of magnitude lower - in the range reported for halophytes. This is the largest variation in plasma membrane permeability reported within a species to date. In addition, Pokkali cells accumulate Na + in their large vacuoles more efficiently than Jaya cells do. 4 heterologous expression of plant transporters in yeast Veena Anil We have expressed an Er -located Ca++-ATPase, ACA2 from Arabidopsis thaliana, in a yeast strain lacking most endogenous Ca++ transporters. The strain is hypersensitive to saline stress due to the elimination of the Ca++-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin B. Expression of ACA2 relieves this hypersensitivity. We have followed the transient rise and decay of cytosolic Ca++ in response to saline stress. The clearance of Ca++ from the cytosol is very slow in the yeast strain lacking Ca++ transporters, but is normal in the transformant expressing ACA2. Further, whereas wild type yeast removes Na+ entering the cytosol by pumping it out across the plasma membrane, the transformant accumulates Na+ in the vacuole, using the pre-vacuolar Na+/H+ - antiporter, Nhx1. Nhx 1 does not normally play a role in the salt-tolerance response of wild type yeast and its activation involves a novel signal transduction mechanism.figure 5. a: cytosolic na+ levels in Jaya and pokkali suspension cells. SBFI-loaded cells were exposed to salt stress for an hour followed by two-photon excitation of the dye at 730 and 780 nm. Fluorescence emission at 515nm was ratiometrically analyzed (730F/780F) to estimate cytosolic Na+. figure 6. correlation between cell viability and cytosolic na+ concentrations. Cell viability was estimated by trypan blue staining, while cytosolic Na + was determined T. NAIR Life may be described as a complex chemical reaction where a multitude of bio-molecules interact and carry out their functions with great precision. The shape of these molecules is crucial to their proper functioning. This is especially true of a majority of proteins, where a linear polypeptide folds to attain a characteristic three-dimensional shape that enables it to possess a specific bioactivity. Usually, for a given protein, a unique three dimensional arrangement of a subset of its atoms in space allows the protein to perform a specific chemical function. X-ray crystallography has traditionally provided valuable information regarding the shape of the molecule and the spatial arrangement of its constituent atoms. Along with Nmr, it is one of the two techniques that can provide a snapshot of the structure of the bio-molecule in its functional as well as inactive state. The primary step in the process of protein crystallography is the purification of protein to high homogeneity to aid crystallization. X-ray diffraction data are collected from the protein crystals. Using mathematical tools, an electron density map of the contents of the crystal is computed. A chemical model of the corresponding protein is built into this map with constant qualitative and quantitative monitoring of the agreement between the model and the diffraction data. The final model is subjected to stringent computational tests to ensure its validity and then analyzed in the context of available biochemical and genetic data. Inferences drawn regarding the chemical function of the molecule from the deduced structure are also confirmed using biochemical and genetic methods. Using macromolecular crystallography and other biophysical methods, we aim to understand the molecular mechanisms of viral infection by the members of the genus Flavivirus. Around 80 flaviviruses have been identified and many of them are responsible for diseases in humans. These include DENV (Dengue fever virus), JEV (Japanese encephalitis virus) and YFV (yellow fever virus) - which cause severe diseases and a large number of fatalities annually all over the world.The flaviviruses are usually transmitted to humans through arthropod vectors. Infection by DENV, JEV and YFV occurs primarily through mosquitoes. The virus particles are enveloped and about 40-50 nanometre in size with an icosahedral capsid. The flavivirus genome is represented by a single-stranded, capped rNA molecule which is a monocistronic mr NA with a single long open reading frame. Translation of the viral genome encodes a 370-kDa polyprotein precursor, which Nair, D.T., Johnson, R. E., Prakash, S., Prakash, L. and Aggarwal, A. K.

In addition the NS3 protein also possesses a rNA helicase activity towards the C-terminus to aid replication. The viral rNA-dependent rNA polymerase (r drp) activity present in the NS5 protein is responsible for replication of the viral genome. Also, NS5 has a methyltransferase activity for capping the progeny rNA at the 5' end. It has been hypothesized that the non-structural proteins associate with presently unknown host cofactors to form complexes where replication takes place. The copies of the progeny rNA generated by these replication complexes are then packaged into the nucleocapsid and the virions undergo maturation in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex. After maturation, the virions are released by vesicle fusion. overall, there has to occur a precise interplay between viral macromolecules and host factors to ensure successful completion of the replicative cycle. We aim to try and understand at a structural level how the different enzymatic activities of the NS3 and NS5 proteins are coordinated to ensure proper replication of the viral r NA.

PURANIK mpuranik@ncbs.res.inNucleic acid-protein interactions are central to cellular function. our lab is studying these interactions in two important cellular contexts: the maintenance of genomic integrity via DNA repair and the production of mononucleotides. Both processes involve highly specific recognition of the nucleic acid substrate and subsequent catalysis by the enzyme. Anti-cancer drugs, normal cellular metabolism, and environmental toxins cause chemical modifications in DNA and rNA. These changes are reversed by cellular DNA repair machinery that identifies the presence of DNA damage and eliminates it by one of several ways. The most common repair strategy for single base modifications is base excision repair (BEr) in which the damaged base is identified and removed by enzymes known as DNA repair glycosylases. modifications due to oxidation and some types of alkylation of nucleobases are repaired by this method. Unique to the repair of alkylation damage is in-situ repair in which the base is restored to its original form without excision from the DNA. The alkylation of guanine by the anti-cancer drug temozolomide to form o6-methylguanine is countered by the human enzyme, mGm T by this process and is a cause of resistance to chemotherapy. mGm T transfers a methyl group from the nucleobase to a cysteine residue and is subsequently targeted for degradation. In an alternative form of in-situ repair, enzymes catalyse removal of the alkyl group and release the corresponding aldehyde e.g., the E.coli protein AlkB and the human proteins ABH2 and ABH3 which repair methylated adenine and cytosine. Another important cellular process is the recycling of free, undamaged nucleobases into nucleotides carried out by enzymes called phosphoribosyl transferases (Pr Tases). Although DNA nucleobase repair and nucleotide salvage are distinct functions, they present similar challenges to the enzymes involved. Each nucleobase substrate must be identified with high specificity while still maintaining the ability to catalyze a wide range of substrates. From the available crystal structures it appears to be achieved by having a protein architecture that permits conformational flexibility rather than a rigid, preassembled active-site (See Figure). The common steps in the two types of nucleobase-protein interaction are then: the recognition of the substrate, followed by the assembly of an appropriate active-site for catalysis. our research aims to understand the mechanistic details of this process. Instrumentation Development: Fundamental to understanding these mechanisms is the ability to study the structure of proteins and nucleic acids in solution. We have developed ultraviolet resonance raman spectroscopy (UVrr) of nucleobases as a probe of the protein active-site. our experiments have demonstrated for the first time that the shifts in the observed raman spectrum of the nucleic acid-protein complex are an excellent probe of their structure. We are now exploring deeper into the ultraviolet region to directly probe the proteins and obtain complementary information.Puranik, M., Weeks, C. L., Lahaye, D., Kabil, O., Taoka, S., Nielsen, S.

NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 20 7/10/08 5:32:13 PM211 Molecular mechanism of multiple by reactive oxygen species produced during the normal metabolism of the cell leads to covalent modification of nucleobases. These modified nucleobases are mutagenic in nature and their presence is implicated in cancer, neurodegenerative disorders and aging. A well-known, major product of DNA oxidation in cells is 8-oxoguanine. The deleterious effects of 8-oxoguanine are combated by formamidopyrimidine glycosylase (FPG), one of the key enzymes in the base excision repair pathway (Figure 1). FPG is highly specific in distinguishing 8-oxoguanine from its normal counterpart, guanine, which differs by only two atoms. In addition to 8-oxoguanine, FPG also recognizes and excises other modifications of guanine, uracil and cytosine. This promiscuity is characteristic of glycosylases and is hypothesized to originate in the conformational flexibility of their active-sites. Indeed, the crystal structures of FPG from different organisms in free and substrate bound forms ( opposite page) reveal considerable conformational changes in the protein structure upon the binding of each type of substrate. Elucidation of the precise mechanism of the recognition of a damaged nucleobase, formation of the active-site and subsequent catalysis requires an understanding of the nucleobase-protein interaction in solution. We are studying the nature of FPG-DNA interaction using UVrr. As a first step, we have studied the structure of free 8-oxoguanine in solution using UVrr. raman spectra obtained with laser excitation at 260 nm of guanine and 8-oxoguanine show remarkably different relative intensities indicative of the difference in the structures of the electronic excited states responsible for the absorption at 260 nm in the two molecules. We have shown that UVrr can be used as a base-specific probe to distinguish between guanine and 8-oxoguanine (Figure 2). The contentious structure of 8-oxoguanine is unequivocally established to be that of the diketo tautomer in solution from our experiments, quantum chemical calculations and normal mode analysis. Having established the specific raman signatures of the oxidized base, we are now using the nucleobase as a probe of the FPG active-site. Experiments involve probing the complex of FPG with 8-oxoguanine containing DNA. 2 on-site repair of alkylated dna by E. coli alkB and its human analogues Nirmala O. and Silja PouloseAlkylating chemicals are widely used as chemotherapeutic drugs in the treatment of cancer, e.g., carmustine, temozolomide, etc. S-adenosylmethionine present in cells is also a potential methylating agent. These and other alkylating agents in the environment damage DNA by adding alkyl groups to nucleobases. Alkylation of nucleobases alters their hydrogen bonding properties leading to cytotoxicity and mutagenicity. Similar modifications can be expected to occur in r NA nucleobases as well. E. coli AlkB (Figure 3) and its human homologues ABH2 and ABH3 bring about direct damage reversal of alkylated single and double stranded DNA and rNA in a reaction that requires Fe(II) as a cofactor, a-ketoglutarate as co-substrate and oxygen (Figure AlkB alkylation lesions such as N1-methyladenine (1meA) and N3-methylcytosine efficiently and N1-methylguanine and N3-methylthymine with lower efficiency. Apart from these small lesions, AlkB removes larger alkyl groups such as ethyl and exocyclic ethano adducts like 1,N and figure 1. the Base e xcision r epair pathway. figure 2. ultra-violet resonance r aman spectra of gMp and its oxidized form, 8-oxoguanosine, in water, ph 7.0, obtained with 260 nm lesions are formed only in single stranded DNA during replication and transcription as these sites are involved in base pairing between complementary strands in a double stranded DNA. How does AlkB accommodate and catalyze both small and large lesions?. The crystal structure of substrate-bound AlkB solved recently by Hunt and coworkers (Nature 2006) provided detailed insight into the mechanism of AlkB action. The Fe(II)-oxoglutarate dioxygenase core matched other superfamily members but the trinucleotide alkylated substrate showed a unique fold designed to hold the 1meA in correct orientation. A conformationally flexible 'lid' was found that completes the assembly of the active-site pocket when the substrate binds to AlkB. The transport of molecular oxygen, essential for the reaction appears to be through a tunnel connected to the active site. The crystals were prepared and examined in the absence of molecular oxygen to prevent the catalytic reaction. However, when oxygen was provided, the reaction was found to be inefficient in the crystal. This suggests the possibility that the structure in solution is different and that protein dynamics may modulate the chemistry. These crystal structures have thrown open several interesting questions about the action of AlkB, the role of protein dynamics and the assembly of the active site pocket for different substrates. We will now address these for the first time using resonance raman spectroscopic approaches developed in our laboratory. 3 understanding the different substrate specificities of human humans is carried out by the de novo synthesis pathway, where nucleotides are synthesized from small molecules present in the cell, and the salvage pathway which involves recycling of previously metabolized intermediates, e.g. purines. Some protozoan parasites like Plasmodium falciparum, the malarial parasite, possess only the salvage pathway for nucleotide synthesis. Inhibitors for this pathway would block nucleotide synthesis and are, thus, a target for chemotherapy against diseases caused by these parasites. The enzyme HGPr T that is a part of the purine salvage pathway is one such therapeutic target. our current interest is to elucidate the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme and to understand differences between the human and Plasmodium enzymes. For these studies, we have developed a first application of UVrr spectroscopy to observe the nucleotide specifically while it is bound to the enzyme. The human and malarial enzymes exhibit differing substrate specificities with the respect to xanthine. The human as well as Plasmodium figure 3. crystal structure of alkB (pdB file: 2fd8) and methylated trinucleotide d(t-mea-t) bound to it. figure 4. Mechanism of alkylation damage reversal by alkB enzyme in the presence of the fe(II) co-factor and the co-substrate (2-oxoglutarate) with consumption of one molecule of oxygen and release of carbon dioxide and nucleotide counterparts inosine monophosphate (Figure catalyses the conversion of xanthine to xanthosine monophosphate as well while the human enzyme does not. The crystal structures currently available do not explain this difference between the two enzymes (Figure 6). With an aim to understand the origin of this substrate specificity, we have examined the end-product complexes of huHGPr T and pfHGPr T spectroscopically. our current experiments of the enzyme-end-product complexes demonstrate that the environment of the nucleobase in the two enzymes has subtle differences. raman spectra of the nucleotides bound to the enzymes show shifts that are found to correlate with the published crystal structures of the enzymes. We plan to carry out experiments with various available site mutants of the enzyme to elucidate the origin of substrate specificity and mechanism of catalysis. While the raman shifts observed experimentally will provide a qualitative measure of the protein- nucleotide interaction, we are using a computational approach to obtain a quantitative interpretation of the observed shifts. Currently, we are carrying out ab initio and density functional theoretical calculations using co-ordinates from the available crystal structure of the enzyme to simulate the protein-nucleotide interaction. The computed structure of the free base (from HF/DFT) will be compared with the structure of the base in the active-site of the protein. The changes in structure due to interaction with the amino acids of the protein will be correlated with observed changes in the corresponding raman spectra. We will further extend these studies to model other substrates and end-products for which crystal structures are not yet available.Collaborator: Hemalatha Balaram, Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, Bangalorefigure 6. crystal structures of human hgprt with bound gMp, (PDBID IHmP) left; and P .

The last rate limiting step of the product binding to the enzyme by incubating the enzyme with a large excess of the product was studied with UVrr. forcesKAUSTUBH R RAU Cells are exposed to fluid forces in a variety of physiological or man-made scenarios. our lab is studying how cells sense and respond to these forces in two different contexts. In the first one, we examine how laser pulses cause damage in tissues in which the damage happens by an explicitly physical mechanism. This question is primarily of interest because of the widespread use of lasers in surgery and medicine. moreover, increasingly laser microbeams are also being used in cell biology for transfection and microsurgery. In both these areas an improved understanding of the laser-cell interaction is critical for the continued development of laser microbeams in biology. We have primarily addressed this question by conducting time-resolved imaging studies on the nanosecond - microsecond timescales. In the second area of research we study fluid-flow sensing of endothelial cells. The apical membrane of endothelial cells is made up of a polymer brush layer that is termed the glycocalyx. It is now known that the glyocalyx is the primary sensor of blood flow in endothelial cells. This fluid sensing is an important physiological function necessary for vasodilation of blood vessels and its mechanism remains a central question in vascular biology. our group is using different microscopy techniques to image this membrane layer and determine if there is any organization inherent to its protein constituents.Cherian, A.V. and Rau, K.R. 3D cell cultures: time-resolved imaging of physical effects and biological response.

Cells on the border of the dead zone survive shear stresses that are 3-4 orders of magnitudes higher than physiological values. Such viability assays are important in understanding cellular response to laser pulses. 100\u00b5m NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 24 7/10/08 imaging and acute biological effectsNanosecond laser surgery with pulse energies in the mJ range is now part of standard clinical practice. Highly focused pulsed lasers (laser microbeams) with energies in the \u00b5J range are also increasingly being used for tissue micro dissection, targeted cell lysis and transfection and cell microsurgery. There is however limited understanding of the physical and biological damage mechanisms of pulsed lasers. models of cell damage based on experimental data will prove useful in development and refinement of laser based tools for surgery and biotechnology. In the present work we have studied laser induced damage in 3D cell cultures and ex-vivo samples of rat corneas using time-resolved imaging and biological assays. Previously we had shown that time-resolved imaging of laser induced cell lysis could provide great insights into the dynamics of the damage process and also generate quantitative data for calculation of shear forces experienced by cells. The imaging system we have designed is capable of capturing fast events from nano- to micro-seconds with < 1 \u00b5m spatial resolution in thick tissue samples. These events have not been studied at such high spatial resolution before and our system can provide a detailed understanding of these processes. Figure 1 shows the dynamics of tissue ablation as captured on our time-resolved system. A cavitation bubble is generated after a single laser pulse is focused into the tissue sample (in this case rat cornea). The bubble expansion and collapse is captured along with the cellular deformation that it induces. In Figure 2 we observe the biological aftermath of the cavitation induced damage. Surprisingly we observe that cells that experienced large deformations due to cavitation bubble of laser- induced damage in the rat corneal epithelium. The time-point at which the image is taken is given in the upper left corner. Cavitation bubble growth and collapse can be clearly visualized along with cellular deformation at the bubble rim. Scale bar = 50 \u00b5m. figure 2. Biological response of corneal epithelium after laser-induced ablation. Phase- contrast imaging of control (a and c) and ablated (b and d) regions.

Rao The use of laser microbeams for cell transfection and microsurgery has been amply demonstrated by several groups. However to date it has not become an established technique mainly due to the numerous parameters that have to be controlled and also due to limited understanding of the damage caused by laser microbeams to cells. We are attempting to standardize this technique for both these applications. Since the group already possesses a detailed understanding of laser-induced damage processes (see above), we can choose the correct parameters for successful transfection or microsurgery but minimize cell death. In the current setup we can deliver 355 or 532 nm, 6 ns focused laser pulses for irradiation of cells or organisms. organelles of interest tagged with fluorescent markers can be viewed using epifluorescence, brought to the laser spot and ablated within few seconds. Experiments on this setup in collaboration with different groups at NCBS involve transfection of mouse embryonic cells (m. Panicker) and neuronal axotomy in C. elegans (S. Koushika). Figure 3 shows examples of both these applications. 3 fluid flow sensing by endothelial cells Understanding the shear sensing ability of endothelial cells remains a central problem in vascular biology. Based on in-vitro biochemical studies and electron microscopy of blood vessels, it has been proposed that the surface layer known as the glycocalyx is the primary sensor of shear effects in endothelial cells. Clinically, it has been observed that the glycocalyx is degraded in conditions of hypoxia, ischemia and atherosclerosis indicating its importance for proper vascular functioning. However, it has been difficult to study the physical properties of the glycocalyx due to its small spatial scale (< 0.2 \u00b5m) and its complex composition. Early transmission electron microscopy studies revealed the presence of an electron dense layer that was 50 nm thick on the surface of endothelial cells. This layer termed the glycocalyx was found to be enriched in glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, glycoproteins and glycolipids. our research is focused on understanding the structure and mechanism of fluid flow sensing of the glycocalyx using a variety of microscopy techniques. We have established protocols for isolating human umbilical endothelial vein cells (HUVEC) and maintaining them in culture. We have also fabricated a bench top device for culturing these cells under physiological flow conditions. The device is made from the elastomer, polydimethylsiloxane (PD mS) and is facile and inexpensive to make and is disposable (Figure 4).

Senthil We are studying two membrane proteins that form part of the glycocalyx namely syndecan-1 and CD44 to determine their organization within the membrane and their role in fluid flow sensing. We will be conducting hetero-Fr ET using fragmented antibodies raised against Syndecan-1 and CD44. GFP fusion constructs of syndecan-1 and CD44 are also being used for transient transfection of endothelial cells. These will be used in homo-Fr ET experiments to determine if these proteins are organized in domains. Transmission electron microscopy of human umbilical vein is also being undertaken to visualize the glycocalyx and identify its components. 5 physical properties of syndecan-1 studied by a tomic force Microscopy P . Senthil and Lokanath Sai We are using biochemical protocols to isolate the heparin sulfate proteogylcan syndecan-1 from endothelial cell surfaces. We wish to study the physical properties of this molecule to understand its role in mechanotransduction. To this end we are attempting to view syndecan-1 molecules using Atomic Force microscopy. Currently we have standardized protocols for isolating proteoglycans from endothelial cell membranes. Attempts are underway to purify this fraction to isolate intact syndecan-1 molecules. We have also optimized protocols for viewing single molecules of hyaluronic acid, a common extracellular polysaccharide using AF m. An example of membrane protein isolation and AF m imaging is shown in after sds- page electrophoresis and silver staining (left). afM image (right) of the purified fraction shows large protein clumps.

NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 27 7/10/08 5:32:18 SHIV ASHANKAR shiva@ncbs.res.in Cellular function, during development and disease, is controlled by changing patterns of gene expression. recent evidence shows that the spatio-temporal organization of a gene and its interaction with the transcription apparatus within the crowded 3D architecture of the cell nucleus is vital to orchestrating gene regulation. Notably, mechanical cues are found to alter gene transcription, cellular differentiation in culture, and developmental programs in organisms, suggesting a strong link between cellular architecture and information control. Thus, understanding design principles of the physical coupling between cellular architecture to transcription control on the nanoscale is of immense importance. recent progress in high resolution live-cell imaging combined with optical spectroscopy and biomechanics methods developed in many laboratories including ours have provided a new paradigm in understanding chromatin structure and function. We use multi-disciplinary approaches (combining methods in soft-condensed matter physics, nanoscience and biology), to probe the mechanistic basis of the spatio-temporal organization of chromatin and its coupling to transcription control at single gene/cluster resolution during cellular differentiation and development. With this approach we hope to understand the spatial code underlying chromatin assembly during differentiation and its implications for cellular transcription control and memory within living cells. Controlled physical perturbations of such a code may then provide possibilities to engineer (as we intend) gene regulation in diverse developmental contexts.

NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 28 7/10/08 5:32:18 PM291 design principles underlying the 3d organization of gene transcription within living cells Shovamayee Maharana, V. Ramya and R.Indulaxmi recent evidence suggests an intimate link between higher-order chromatin assembly and transcriptional hubs, where genes appear to interact with the transcription apparatus to regulate their expression within a living cell. In order to understand the design principles that underlie gene transcription, we have developed live-cell imaging assays to visualize transcription factories (TF) and candidate gene loci (Figure-1). Single-particle tracking analysis of TF reveals their ATP-dependent dynamic organization. TF dynamics were cell-cycle dependent and hindered by specific histone deacetylase inhibitors which decondense chromatin assembly. Upstream sites of a candidate gene were marked with tandem 96 lac operator repeats enabling us to visualize the position of the gene loci. Live cell imaging of the gene locus exhibited confined diffusion in the repressed state, while gene activation resulted in increased mobility. Collectively these experiments, using live-cell imaging and chromatin capture assays, will probe how a transcription factor, a factory and gene loci/clusters temporally organize within the 3D architecture of the living cell nucleus to control transcription and cellular memory. 2 tracking epigenetic plasticity in higher-order chromatin assembly during cellular differentiation Shefali Talwar and Soumya Gupta In this project, we study how epigenetic plasticity in higher-order chromatin assembly impinges on differential gene expression programs during cellular differentiation. Experiments in our laboratory and others have revealed that histone and other nuclear proteins that compact higher order chromatin assembly are highly mobile within the cell nucleus (Figure-2). Further, recent evidence has suggested that chromatin assembly is highly plastic in undifferentiated cells, arising due to hyper- dynamic histone proteins. Using fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (Fr AP) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) methods, we observed that there exist distinct diffusive mechanisms for core and linker histone proteins. Intriguingly, the mobility of histone proteins were found to be differentially altered resulting in the transition from a plastic to frozen chromatin organization during cellular differentiation in both mouse embryonic stem cells and during Drosophila embryo development. We are now studying the dynamic reorganization of higher-order chromatin assembly and its coupling to transcription control of lineage specific genes within single living cells in two functional contexts: haematopoietic stem-cell differentiation NCBS 3 the coupling the pre-stressed cell nucleus Nisha Ramdas and Aprotim MazumderIn living cells, the nucleus is balanced by cytoplasmic architectural elements to provide an appropriate size and shape that is conjectured to be important in defining genome function. Nuclear size within the cytoplasmic context is larger as compared to isolated nuclei suggesting the existence of a mechanical pre-stressed state. We show that the organization of chromatin assembly is a balance of physical forces; outward forces arising due to their entropic nature given the length of the genome and due to cytoplasmic components and inward forces driven by histone tail-tail interactions and other nuclear proteins that condense the genome into metaphase chromosomes. In order to test if the pre-stressed state of the nucleus is coupled to higher-order chromatin assembly, we developed a laser G V SHIVASHANKAr B\u0000 C\u0000 LIVE CELL\u0000IMAGING\u0000COMBINED\u0000WITH\u0000 SINGLE PARTICLE\u0000TRACKING\u0000ANALYSIS\u0000 figure 1. live-cell imaging combined with single-particle tracking analysis a.

Fluorescence anisotropy maps of the same proteins within living cells (Figure 3). Upon ablation of heterochromatin nodes, the pre-stressed state of the nucleus was released resulting in shrinkage of nuclear size. In contrast, ablation at the euchromatin regions does not alter the structural integrity of the nucleus. ongoing experiments are aimed at dissecting the role of mechanical pre-stress, shape and size of the nucleus on genome function using sub-cellular perturbations combined with an rNAi screen. 4 Mechanosignaling to chromatin and its impact on transcription control and cellular differentiation Venkatesan Iyer and Feroz Meeran This project is centred on understanding how mechanical cues on the cell membrane are transduced to a gene locus and the implications for transcription control and cellular differentiation. For this we have developed a magnetic force apparatus to induce controlled mechanical perturbations within living cells. In response to such cues, cytoskeletal reorganization, nuclear shape and gene locus/transcription factory displacements within single living cells are monitored. magnetic beads are non- specifically adhered onto the membrane of mammalian cells. The application of a mechanical force on the plasma membrane by a tip-based electromagnet induces stretching of the cytoskeletal network thereby allowing us to map mechano-signaling to chromatin using simultaneous Fr ET/anisotropy imaging of the cell nucleus (Figure 4). These methods have now been extended to test architectural coupling within chromatin using microinjected magnetic beads into the nucleus. Taken together, our experiments suggest that there exists a mechanical platform wherein transcription sites are connected to cellular architecture. This may provide a basis for integrating mechano-signaling events to transcription sites and thereby induce cellular differentiation programs using mechanical cues. 5 Impact of mechano-signaling cues on cell-fate decisions in Drosophila embryo development Abhishek Kumar Early development of the Drosophila embryo requires robust spatio-temporal cooperativity in cellular movements and their positioning. Post 13 th division marks the onset of cellularization and subsequently cells invaginate to different regions in the developing embryo. The fate of the cell (ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm) is highly region-specific and dependent on the morphogen gradient experienced within the developing embryo. We have developed methods to modulate chromatin assembly and physically perturb cellular invaginations (Figure 5). Spot ablation during invagination results in novel visual phenotypes within the developing embryos. We have uncovered that a robust position-dependent architectural integrity maintains germ band extension. We are currently establishing early segmental pair-rule gene expression reporter systems as readouts of physical perturbations during cellular invaginations. Further, behavioural readouts using single larval tracking experiments are used to characterize the phenotypes. Thus, manipulating single cells or groups of cells and presenting them controlled mechanical cues should allow us to test if nuclear shape and higher-order chromatin organization have a bearing on cell-fate decisions within a developing embryo and attempt schematic for the maintenance of the cell nucleus.

SOWDHAMINI mini@ncbs.res.in Proteins are related to each other at different levels in a hierarchical manner - some of them are closely-knit into homologous families wherein they look similar in every way: sequence, structure and biological function. There are more distant relationships where the proteins may have diverged extensively, reflected as low sequence identity but still are remarkably similar and perform similar biological function: these are grouped as superfamilies. There are many other protein domains that happen to share similar folds and could be unrelated in sequence and function. The homologous family level is trivial to identify in a predictive sense and are \"no-brainers\", but the superfamily level relationships are hard to reliably predict given mere sequence information and hence are more challenging. We are interested in the generation of structural bioinformatics algorithms that can perform well at distant relationships amongst proteins to apply in biological problems.

Tripathi and R. SowdhaminiEarly statistics of mass protein structure and function prediction on genome sequences indicated that nearly 40% of the gene products appear to be globular but have surpassed computational tools to be associated with a known protein family such that function prediction was possible. Till today, this statistics holds true. In the past, we have applied sensitive algorithms to recognize putative members of protein families and superfamilies (Bhaduri and 2005; metpally and Sowdhamini, 2005) in whole genomes to improve function prediction. We have now extended genome-wide survey for serine proteases in two plants species, representative of dicots and monocots, to perform cross-genome survey of the extent of homology in different serine proteases. Although the genome sizes are different, we find nearly equal numbers of different types of serine proteases (Tripathi and Sowdhamini, 2006). We find that the serine carboxypeptidases, largely identified in plants and associated with secondary metabolism, for instance, suggest extensive duplication subsequent to monocot-dicot divergence and possible functional redundancy for these enzymes (Figure 1a). Despite two distinct clades (I and II), the presence of rice-only and Arabidopsis-only subclades suggests early diversification of these members followed by rapid species-specific expansion. The signal peptidases in the two species fall into two clusters (Figure 1b) with high sequence identities: the type I proteases that contain Ser-Lys catalytic dyad are found in prokaryotes, chloroplasts and in mitochondria, whereas the type II proteases that contain Ser-His catalytic dyad are found in Er and also observed in archaea. Rhomboids are one of the largest membrane-bound serine protease families containing seven T m helices and are conserved in several species. Phylogenetic analysis of Arabidopsis and rice rhomboid-like proteins (Figure 1c) reveals presence of several gene clusters that share low pairwise sequence identity with each other, though the members within a cluster share significant sequence similarity with each other. multiple clusters suggest polyphyletic origin, perhaps some acquired by lateral gene transfer and have bacterial origin. members of Clade I and II correspond to rHo and PErL subfamilies. members of Clade IV and VII contain an additional ubiquitin-like domain and the clustering patterns suggest that this domain architecture had evolved much before monocot-dicot divergence. Nevertheless, it illustrates that additional domains and domain architecture of genes provide important information about the overall function of the gene products. 2 sensitive approaches for enhanced function association 2a. Sensitive sequence search strategiesKumar Gaurav, Sandhya Sankaran and R. SowdhaminiThe availability of known members of protein families enables the construction of records of the position, order and spacing of conserved regions or motifs in protein families. We have developed a neural-network driven procedure, called FASS m, which can objectively score new sequences for their match to pre-recorded motifs of existing protein families (Gaurav et al., 2005). This method will be especially useful for detecting newer domains that have undergone evolutionary changes like circular permutation and discontinuity in domains from classical members. In addition, we have developed an approach, called CASCADE PSI-BLAST, that employs multiple generations of PSI-BLAST searches figure 1. genome-wide survey of plant serine proteases and cross-genome surveys across and rice Putative proteases across both genomes are multiply aligned using CLUSTALX and clustered using PHYLIP (Thompson et al., 1994) and the alignments were exported to Phylip package for representing the Neighbor-Joining tree.

SowdhaminiThere are often large regions of globular proteins that are not associated to pre-existing domains. We propose an approach to fill-in these gaps in domain assignments (Figure 2b) where we examine unassigned regions of considerable length, sequence conservation and predicted structural content to accumulate sequence homologues. We then examine the domain architecture of individual homologous sequences using Hidden markov model searches against PFAm database to extrapolate possible newer domains into the gene of interest. We show that these indirect connections can enable better domain assignments for nearly 25% of the unassigned regions that we had examined amongst the genes that contain adenylate cyclase domains (Chandrashekar et al., 2006). The realisation of connections to pre-existing domains can have direct consequences in better understanding of biological function of gene products. 3 protein structure validation Pugalenthi, Ganesan, Shameer Khader and R. SowdhaminiSubsequent to homology modeling of protein domains, there could be errors in the entire protein model or in different parts of the model like loop regions. These could be non-trivial errors that are introduced owing to poor sequence identity between the query and template structure. A structure validation procedure was earlier developed, called HArmoNY, that is also provided as a webserver (Pugalenthi et al., 2006), to obtain a retrospective picture of the quality of the model and checks the compatibility between structure and sequence. The local environments of individual residues in a protein structure are assessed for its quality by considering structural parameters like secondary structure, hydrogen bonding and solvent burial. Gross errors in a structure could suggest misfolds and the method is equally efficient at detecting local errors in protein modeling that might reside in loop regions.Collaborator: N. Srinivasan, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 4 structural Motifs in protein domain superfamilies Anirban Bhaduri, Pugalenthi Ganesan and R. SowdhaminiIn order to recognise the correct connections, it is equally important to ensure that the interior of the fold or the protein core is preserved. We had earlier reported that spatially interacting conserved regions of the protein domains are useful drivers to improve sensitivity as well as figure 2. sensitive sequence search approaches for recognizing connections between pre-existing protein domain families. a. Schematic representation of two protein families in sequence space to illustrate the effectiveness of CASCADE PSI-BLAST approach (Sandhya et al., 2005) in connecting distantly related protein families. Each ellipse represents a family in sequence space with their classical family members shown as stars within the ellipse. Added stars represent intermediate sequences obtained as hits during different generations of PSI-BLAST that could be useful in relating the two families. PSI-BLAST runs in every generation are performed with stringent E-value thresholds to avoid false positives and drifts. b. Schematic representation of indirect domain finding techniques (Chandrashekar et al., 2006). In many gene products, large regions (more than 70 residues) are noticed where no assignment has been recorded to sequence domain family database (Bateman et al., 2000). It is possible to assign sequence domains by additionally accumulating information about the sequence homologues and their domain architectures. Such an unassigned region or linker is shown in black and co-existing domains labeled as A and B. Sequence homologues to the linker suggest the presence of an additional domain X (marked by green the workflow of sMotIf server to recognize structural templates of a protein or a protein superfamily. A protein structural entry is submitted as input either as sequence or PDB code. Where possible, the server internally recognizes other structural members of the protein superfamily. After best superposition and considering structural environments such as solvent accessibility and hydrogen bonding, structurally conserved regions or 'structural templates' are recognized and mapped on the structures. Additional structural parameters such as intermotif torsion angles and distances are also calculated. r So WDHA mINIspecificity (Bhaduri et al., 2004). We have now developed a webserver, S moTIF, which automatically identifies structural motifs and examines structural properties (Pugalenthi et al., 2007). Starting from a crude sequence alignment of structural entries, a rigid-body superposition leads to obtaining a more reliable structure-based sequence alignment. With further accumulation of sequence homologues, one can examine amino acid conservation and examine structural parameters critically. These are then objectively coded to provide scores to different regions of the protein fold that can in turn enable the automatic recognition of structural motifs. These motifs can be projected on the structure and further analysed for inter-motif distances and angles (Figure 3). Such structural analyses can be helpful to experimental biologists in designing the expression or characterization of protein domains and in generating point mutants. Such analyses can facilitate computational biologists in ascertaining if the structurally conserved regions have been carefully preserved in alignments and in modelling.Collaborators: Saikat Chakrabarti, National Institutes of Health, USA; P .

A network is a group of entities, connected by a web of interactions, whose collective behavior can be remarkably complex. In living systems, networks arise in various contexts, across many scales. Physical networks of specific amino-acid contacts can generate an attractive potential between proteins. The set of transient and permanent protein complexes in a cell is abstractly represented as a protein interaction network. The uptake and efflux of material by a cell, and the movement of cargo between various intracellular compartments, defines a traffic network. Cells use signalling and regulatory networks to control gene expression, metabolism, and traffic, in response to external conditions. And groups of cells can influence one-another, as occurs by means of chemical and electrical signals in a neuronal network. In every sense, these are truly living networks. Each network is a dynamic object, whose state changes as a function of time; moreover, the structure of a network itself, its connectivity and topology, can vary over evolutionary timescales. Together, these aspects define the two questions on which we focus. First, we use quantitative experiments, coupled with mathematical and computational models, to study the dynamical properties of living networks. Second, we use genomic and protein sequence data to probe the evolutionary history of these systems. We find that, across scales and contexts, the 'network idea' is a broad and powerful framework within which the complexity of biological systems can be usefully organized and studied.Dabholkar, S. and Thattai, M. (2007). Brainstorming Biology. IET Synthetic Biology, 1, 17-20. Thattai, M., Burak, Y. and Shraiman, B.I. (2007). The of specificity in polyketide synthase protein interactions. PloS Computational Biology, 3, e186. A dash of color reveals how specificity arises in a protein interaction network. Polyketides are pharmaceutically important biochemicals, synthesized in bacteria by giant multi-protein chains of polyketide synthase proteins. In order to be functional, these chains must be correctly ordered. When the N- and C-terminal sticky ends of each protein are colored according to a phylogenetic clustering, the interaction specificity code emerges: pairs of compatible sticky ends are invariably of the same color. NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 36 7/10/08 5:32:24 PM371 the origins of specificity in the polyketide synthase protein interaction network Polyketides, a diverse group of heteropolymers with antibiotic and antitumor properties, are assembled in bacteria by multi-protein chains of modular polyketide synthase (PKS) proteins. Specific protein-protein interactions determine the order of proteins within a multi-protein chain, and thereby the order in which chemically distinct monomers are added to the growing polyketide product. We investigated the evolutionary and molecular origins of protein interaction specificity. We focussed on the short, conserved N- and C-terminal docking domains that mediate interactions between modular PKS proteins. our analysis revealed a hieararchical interaction specificity code. PKS docking domains are descended from a single ancestral interacting pair, but have split into three phylogenetic classes that are mutually non-interacting. Specificity within one such compatibility class is determined by a few key residues, which can be used to define compatibility sub-classes. A single PKS system can use docking domain pairs from multiple classes, as well as domain pairs from multiple sub-classes of any given class. The termini of individual proteins are frequently shuffled, but docking domain pairs straddling two interacting proteins are linked as an evolutionary module. The hierarchical and modular organization of the specificity code is intimately related to the processes by which bacteria generate new PKS pathways.Collaborators: Y. Burak and B.I. Shraiman, Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, UCSB, USA and Andrei Lupas, Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Germany 2 co-evolving residues and physical interactions our goal was to identify residue pairs that co-evolved between interacting proteins. This task is complicated by the fact that sequence datasets are typically small and non-uniformly sampled, therefore dominated by spurious correlations. To overcome this problem, we developed a new algorithm called C roSS (correlated residues of statistical significance) which uses both interaction and non-interaction data to identify significant pairings between residues. The algorithm takes two inputs (multiple sequence alignment of proteins, and experiemental data about protein interactions) and identifies residue pairs involved in interaction specificity. We applied C roSS to analyze the interaction between polyketide synthase (PKS) proteins. The analysis picked out only eight significant residues, seven of which were involved in pairwise physical interactions in an Nmr structure of a PKS interaction complex. This provided strong confirmation that C roSS was able to sensitively pick out co-evolving residues.Collaborators: Y. Burak UCSB, USAfigure 1. co-evolving residues in pks protein interactions. a. We refer to pks protein interaction domains as heads (red) and tails (green). The C roSS matrix runs over head residues (vertical) and tail residues (horizontal). Bright entries represent significant co-evolution. b/c. Structure of the head-tail interaction complex. d/e/f. We zoom in on the eight significant residues identified in Figure 2a; remarkably, seven of these are involved in pairwise physical interactions. mU K U N D T H A T T A of rapid genetic switches Sugat Dabholkar We used a simple mathematical model to investigate the factors that primarily determine the rapidity of response of a genetic switch. Specifically, we explored the case in which a cell switches its gene expression level between two distinct states, in response to a sudden change in the concentration of an extracellular biochemical. We defined a dimensionless measure of rapidity, and used optimization techniques to generate networks with the most rapid response possible given various biochemical constraints. We found that the key determinants of rapidity were protein lifetime, maximal and minimal transcription rates, and the ratio of induced to uninduced expression levels. our analysis suggests that the promoter transfer function (the rate of transcription as a function of regulatory inputs) might be optimized for its dynamical properties, rather than its steady-state behavior. We next applied our rapidity analysis to experimental data, investigating the time-dependence of transcription rates at an Escherichia coli promoter as extracellular conditions were shifted between various discrete states. Specifically, we measured the concentration of a chromosomally integrated copy of gfp, under the control of the lac promoter. Extracellular conditions were defined by various combinations of positive and negative regulators of P lac. We measured GFP expression over several hours using fluorescence microscopy of single cells, and avoided cell-density dependent effects by using a novel serial dilution assay. We found that the different regulators elicited very different dynamical responses and that, in terms of rapidity, there was a distinct asymmetry between the way a promoter turned on versus the way it turned off. 4 Modelling the response of neurons in the rat olfactory bulb to odor mixtures The aim of the experiment was to investigate the response of neurons in the rat olfactory bulb to mixtures of odors. The rat was presented with two pure odors, designated A and B, as well as various mixtures of these. The odor was presented in pulses, flanked by periods in which the rat responded to air alone. The responses of single neurons were recorded using tetrodes; simultaneously, the rat's respiratory phase was recorded. Typically, every neuron responded with a characteristic firing pattern as a function of respiration phase, with the pattern being different between the odor and air presentations, but uniform within each presentation. This function varied smoothly as the figure 2. Quantifying the rapidity of a genetic switch. a. A change in external conditions, a(t), triggers a change in the internal state of a cell, b(t). The score z measures how rapidly the cell reaches its final state. b. We used a chromosomal copy of gfp driven by P lac, and grew cells in media containing various combinations of inducers lactose, T mG, and IPTG, as well as negative regulators glucose and fructose. c/d. Promoter activity measured in terms of reporter accumulation, when IPTG is added to glucose medium (c: GGI) or removed from it was varied between pure A and pure B, but it could not be represented as a simple superposition of the response to pure odors. To capture this behavior, we developed the following model: the neuron receives both activating and inhibiting inputs, with contributions from the air, odor A, and odor B; these contributions are summed in a concentration dependent manner, and passed through a sigmoidal non-linearity to give the neural output. A strong feature of this model is that the response to any mixture of odors is completely determined by the response to the individual components. The model was able to accurately account for the diverse responses of the 23 neurons investigated.Collaborators: A.G. Khan and U.S. Bhalla, NCBS 5 the living networks w orkshop The aim of the Living Networks workshop is to design, construct, and validate genetic networks in living bacterial cells. This fits into the wider framework of synthetic biology, an engineering discipline that seeeks to achieve the routine, rapid, reproducible design and fabrication of biological networks. our workshop begins with multidisciplinary brainstorming sessions, in which participants design networks having various dynamical properties. The actual network construction, achieved by standard molecular biology techniques, is contracted to a company. Finally the participants experimentally test their constructs for the desired behaviors. We present our results at iGEm, mIT's International Genetically Engineered machines Competition. In 2007 our entry picked up one of the top awards at this prestigious international event. figure 3. response of neurons to odor mixtures. a.

Synchronization of bacterial cell cycles.

X-Y regulation of bacterial chemotaxis. We used a host strain that was deficient in the serine and aspartate receptors, Tsr and Tar. These receptors were expressed from IPTG- and aTc- inducible promoters, so the sensitivity of a cell to various chemical gradients could be tuned. c. Converting a transient stimulus to a persistent response. The E. coli SoS promoter produces a burst of transcription in response to UV-induced DNA damage. Coupling this to the positive-feedback lac system should allow this burst to be converted into a persistent expression of GFP . mU K U N D T H A T T A unfold and misfold?JAYANT B. UDGAONKAR To fold into the unique structure that enables it to function in the cell, a polypeptide chain must condense as well as turn, bend, coil, loop and twist itself in a very precise manner. The protein folding problem is to understand how structure develops as a protein folds. An understanding of the mechanism of protein folding will contribute to a better understanding of the other facet of the protein folding problem, which is how to predict the functional structure of a protein from the amino-acid sequence that specifies it. The protein folding problem is a long-standing, unsolved puzzle in biology, whose solution will have obvious practical biotechnological as well as medical applications. In particular, the improper folding of many proteins, and the consequent aggregation of mis-folded proteins into fibrils, are characteristic features of many neuro-degenerative diseases as well as of the prion diseases. my laboratory uses several small proteins, including barstar, monellin, thioredoxin, the SH3 domain of the PI3-kinase, a-synuclein, and the mouse prion protein as archetypical model proteins for studying how proteins fold, unfold and mis-fold. We also study how correct folding is assisted by the chaperone GroEL. We use the tools of protein engineering and physical biochemistry. These include diverse optical spectroscopic methods, including time-resolved fluorescence methods, as well as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry methods. In order to study folding, we typically use millisecond mixing methods to initiate refolding, as well as faster mixing methods with sub-millisecond resolution. Highlights of our recent work on protein folding and unfolding include (1) the demonstration of competing pathways for the folding of monellin, (2) the demonstration that different regions of barstar acquire structure at slightly different rates during the major folding reaction suggesting that structure formation in different regions may not be synchronized, and (3) the demonstration that the initial collapse of the polypeptide chain during folding, is a gradual barrier-less transition, in which specific structure is nevertheless formed. Highlights of our recent work on protein misfolding and aggregation include (1) the demonstration that the transformation of soluble oligomers of barstar into amyloid protofibrils occurs in multiple steps, (2) the demonstration that the mouse prion protein can form amyloid protofibrils and fibrils rapidly under suitable conditions, and (3) the demonstration that two-chain monellin can form amyloid protofibrils and fibrils by different mechanisms under different aggregation conditions.Kumar, S., Mohanty, S., and Udgaonkar, J.B.

( 2007) Characterization of the folding and unfolding reactions of single-chain monellin: evidence for multiple 5:32:27 PM411 specific structure is acquired in a continuous structural transition during the initial folding reactions of barstar Kalyan SinhaTo determine whether the initial folding reactions of proteins, which occur in the microsecond time domain, are barrier-limited, all-or-none transitions, or barrier-less gradual transitions, and to determine whether specific structure is formed in either case, has been a major challenge in protein folding studies. Eleven different intra-molecular distances were measured in the product of the microsecond folding reactions of barstar, as were the changes in these distances during its formation from completely unfolded protein. It is seen that these distances not only change in a gradual manner during this transition, but also that the changes in these different distances are not synchronized with each other. The site-specific characterization of the initial folding reactions of barstar therefore indicates that these reactions are barrier-less. Nevertheless, secondary structure can form during these folding reactions. A detailed analysis of the initial contraction of the polypeptide chain during folding indicates that there are two components to the contraction. A non-specific component is seen for all distances measured. This arises from the change in solvent, which is used to initiate folding, and can be predicted from the response of completely unfolded protein to a change in solvent conditions. A specific component is seen for some but not all intra-molecular distances. This appears to lead to the formation of specific structure. A microsecond mixing device has been built to study the initial ultra-fast folding reactions. Intra- molecular distances are seen to contract at rates exceeding 10,000 s -1. more specific structure appears to form at a rate of 4000 s-1. The observation that the slower rate is independent of denaturant concentration is strongly indicative of a barrier-less transition. 2 cooperativity of the major folding reaction of barstar Santosh Kumar Jha To ascertain whether structure formation is synchronized across different regions of a protein during its major folding reaction has been a difficult endeavor. To obtain such information at the individual residue side-chain level for the major millisecond folding reaction of barstar, a cysteine thiol labeling methodology, coupled to mass spectrometric detection, was used to determine the rates of side-chain burial at 10 different sites on the protein. The major folding reaction could be shown to be multi-step, with different regions appearing to fold at different rates. The earliest intermediate populated at a few milliseconds of folding has been shown to be a loosely compact, but still completely solvated form.figure 1. asynchronous contraction of intramolecular distances during the formation of the early millisecond intermediate from completely unfolded protein during the folding of barstar. The results suggest that multiple pathways of folding may of single-chain monellin Ashish Kumar Patra To establish the existence of competing pathways for the folding or unfolding of a protein, which do not arise from slow isomerization events in the starting unfolded or folded state, is of great interest because these pathways may represent alternative sequences of structural events describing the formation or dissolution of structure. Such competing pathways have now been demonstrated in the case of single-chain monellin, a small intensely sweet protein. The roles of partially folded intermediate structures in determining the kinetic partitioning events responsible for the competing pathways have been studied. 4 folding and unfolding of an apparent two-state folder Ajazul Hamid Wani To dissect a complex protein folding or unfolding reaction into simpler steps, it is important to identify and characterize the folding intermediates that define the folding or unfolding pathways. It is not easy to make out whether the folding pathway of a two-state folding protein, which appears to fold without detectable formation of intermediates, is the same under different folding conditions. The SH3 domain of the PI3 kinase appears to be a two-state folder, but spectroscopic changes during unfolding occur in more than one step. The differences observed in the transition state structures for folding in guanidine hydrochloride and urea, suggest that the folding pathways are different in the two denaturants. 5 collapse of an unfolded protein Amrita Sekhar To understand structural transitions in an unfolded protein is vital for understanding how the protein folds. Fr ET methods are being used to study polypeptide chain contraction in the natively-unfolded protein, a -synuclein, in conditions where no structure is formed, as well as in conditions that lead to partial structure formation. 6 folding of a dimeric protein Aghera Nilesh To obtain an understanding of how multimeric proteins fold and assemble is an important component of protein folding studies. Two-chain monellin is being used as a model protein to study the assembly of polypeptide chains during folding. Assembly is being studied in the absence as well as in the presence of the folding chaperone GroEL. 7 Mechanism of amyloid protofibril formation by barstar Santosh Kumar and Subhendu MohantyTo delineate the steps leading to the formation of amyloid protofibrils and fibrils is an important element in protein aggregation studies. The use of multiple structural probes has allowed a detailed study of the formation of amyloid protofibrils of barstar from soluble oligomers. Aggregation has been shown to occur in multiple steps and along multiple pathways. It appears that the conformation transition leading to an enhancement of -strand structure occurs at the same time that single- stranded protofibrils associate laterally and become multi-stranded. Cysteine scanning mutagenesis is being used to investigate systematically the participation of different residue positions in protofibril formation. It appears that the kinetics of aggregation are particularly sensitive to changes at only a few specific residue positions. 8 Mechanism of formation of amyloid protofibrils and fibrils by the mouse prion protein Shweta Jain Aggregation of the cellular prion protein leads to neuronal degeneration in the brain. In vitro conditions have been established, in which the mouse prion protein forms first amyloid protofibrils and then figure 2. Mechanism of formation of amyloid protofibrils by barstar. The soluble 16mer (A form) grows to first form higher order oligomers and then to form critical oligomers. The critical oligomers associate laterally to form amyloid protofibrils. Conformational conversion appears to occur protein aggregation is being studied. The aggregation process has been shown to be exquisitely sensitive to solvent conditions. 9 Mechanism of amyloid fibril formation by two-chain monellin.

The critical concentration for aggregation has been determined. multiple steps that involve multiple conformational changes have been delineated. Small changes in solvent conditions seem to affect the mechanism of the aggregation process. 10 aggregation of a-synuclein in neuronal cells Vishal Deposits of the protein a-synuclein in Lewy bodies, in specific dopaminergic neurons in the brain are a characteristic feature of Parkinson's disease. To understand the steps leading to the formation of such protein inclusions, the aggregation of a-synuclein in a cultured neuronal cell is studied.Collaborator: M.M.

An observation in the context of transformation assays that we believe has deep pathophysiologial signficance is the marked cooperativity that we detect of disregulated Notch signaling with an E6 L83V variant that accumulates in the progression of human cervical cancers. We have delineated a context specific survival signal which is dependent on Notch-PI3K signaling and extending this to show a role for this pathway in mediating mediating an epithelial to mesenchyme transition. more recently, we have uncovered a role for Notch in mediating the upregulation of myc, an archetypal pro-oncogene. We have not detected mutations in the Notch locus in the limited sequencing analysis that we have undertaken consistent with our suggestion of a ligand dependent mechanism of activation. our current focus is in trying to identify human cervical cancer stem cells and integrating this into our observations on Notch signaling and the various biochemical pathways. Model of hpv system devised by A. rangarajan to analyse the cooperative transformation of the two key papillomavirus oncogenes E6 and E7 from the high risk virus type 16 along with activated alleles of Notch1, we analysed what effector mechanisms might operate downstream of Notch signaling. We first noted that c-m yc can cooperate with E6 and E7 analogous to activated Notch1. Intriguingly, in the context of Notch1 mediated transformation, using dominant negative blockers of c-m yc function, we were able to retard the transforming process. This led us to evaluate as to whether activated Notch1 was able to upregulate myc levels. We have previously shown that Notch activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway relies on a CBF1 independent process, the core effector mechanism in this signaling pathway. Here, we noted the existence of CBF1 binding sites in the upstream regulatory region of the c-m yc gene and were able to show that expression of activated Notch1 upregulates c-m yc in a manner dependent on CBF1. Cumulatively, activated Notch1 seems to phenocopy ras and utilize c-m yc in a CBF1 independent and dependent manner respectively to mediate transformation. 2 signal integration of the notch pathway in human cervical cancer Deepa Subramanyam, Eric Vivien, Sweta Srivastava and Mousita Kamarkar \"Context\" is of enormous importance in defining the events that occur during the process of oncogenesis. However, both the mechanisms and the processes that should be used to study this phenomenon are presently poorly understood. one of the potential intersection points of extra- cellular regulation of Notch function is through mediating the stability. The Notch protein is targeted for degradation through many still poorly understood mechanisms and one of the putative processes is through the SCF adaptor protein Fbw7. We have been following up an interesting observation where we noted that the inhibition of Notch mediated cooperative transformation in \"in vitro\" assays with Fbw7 can be reversed by growth factors. We are currently in the process of establishing the molecular mechanisms that mediate this process through a combination of functional studies, extensive mutagenesis of the Notch allele and mass spec based techniques. 3 cellular invasion in human cervical cancer Bharathi Ramdass, Tessy Maliekal and Pradip Nair This work stemmed from a multi-centric collaborative programme grant that was funded by the Department of Biotechnology. Features of disregulated Notch and NF- kB signaling have been noted in independent studies. Here we set out to determine on a large scale the veracity of these observations SUDHI possible cross-talk between these two pathways. We established in the large study that there were parallel features of both Notch and NF-k activation. Using a combination of in viro analysis, we are able to Notch activation functions as an upstream regulator of NF-k in this context. In addition, our data uncovers some interesting observation about the relationship of Notch signaling to cell cycle regulators and the p53 pathway extending some of our earlier insights generated by P .

Sweta SrivastavarhoGTPases such as rhoC has been linked to invasive tumor progression. However, the upstream regulators of rhoC are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of rhoC in the context of invasive human cervical cancers. We initially demonstrate that increasing rhoC activity increases motility, invasion and in vivo tumor formation in xenografts of cervical carcinoma cell lines. We then examined the relationship to the Notch-PI3K axis; a pathway that we have suggested earlier is involved in driving the invasive phase of human cervical cancers. We show that inhibition of PI3K, Notch or rho GTPases blocks the induction of Em T, a phenomenon that is central to invasive tumor progression. Further, inhibition of either PI3K- Akt axis or Notch activity reduces the activity of rhoC. In addition to extending the role of rhoC to invasive cervical cancers, these results position rhoC downstream of Notch-PI3K signaling in the context of these cancers. 5 hunting for human cervical cancer stem cells Tessy Maliekal, Jeevisha Bajaj and Eric VivienWe are in the process of characterizing human cervical tumours for their resident stem cells and integrating that information into our models of Notch signaling.

( 2007). mutations in dynamin-related protein result in gross changes in mitochondrial morphology and affect synaptic vesicle recycling at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction. Genes Brain Behaviour 6, 42-53. Understanding the cellular basis of animal behavior is broadly the research aim of my group. The brain is essentially responsible for behavior and is composed of a large number of neurones and glia, over 100 billion of them in humans and a million in Drosophila. Synapses are specialized junctions through which the cells of the nervous system signal to each other and to muscles or glands and control other systems of the body. Synapses allow the neurons of the central nervous system to form interconnected circuits that underlie perception,emotions and thought. most of the syanpses in the central nervous system are chemical synapses. At these synapses neurotransmitter substances are released into the synaptic cleft by exocytic fusion of the membrane bound vesicles and subsequently the vesicular machinery is recycled and repacked with neurotransmitter. The cell biology of the vesicle cycle and its molecular underpinnings are not only conserved in different organisms but in different cellular contexts. We use genetic, cell biological and molecular approaches in Drosophila to delineate mechanisms of vesicle cycling and trafficking. Acute temperature sensitive paralytic mutants have been of particular value in this approach. Endosomal trafficking studies in primary cell cultures derived from animals carrying conditional mutations has turned out to be insightful for understanding principles of membrane trafficking in general as well. Little is known about the mechanisms of general anaesthesia. We have been able to input a promising new approach to this area in the form of mutations that render Drosophila resistant to the effects of inhalational anaesthetics. We have initiated a major project to identify and characterise toxic components of venoms of a large number of carnivorous marine snails of the genus Conidae.

Our observations in larval hemocytes suggest that Stoned and Eps15 regulate clathrin mediated dynamin-dependent endocytotic process, specifically by catalyzing the recruitment of clathrin to pits at early stages of membrane retrieval. in order to further understand the regulation of receptor mediated endocytosis by tyrosine kinase, the role of Cdk5/p 35 was studied. homozygous combinations were made with shibire alleles namely ts1, ts 2, and ck2. initial experiments to check paralysis profiles suggest that the p35 null causes enhancement of shibire paralysis, implicating a role for Cdk5 mediated phophorylation in synaptic vesicle recycling. Surface accessibility assays isolated were done using p35 mutant and transgenes of Cdk5 driven by collagen- Gal4. The clearance of surface receptors is adversely affected in p35 mutant background. We also observe that p35 mutants affect the temperature dependent paralysis phenotype of shibire flies. at the cellular level, abrogation of p35 or Cdk5 genetically or by pharmacological reagents adversely affected receptor internalization in hemocytes. Cultured embryonic neurons from mutant and wild type Drosophila are being analyzed as a prospective system for study of vesicle recycling. Collaborator: S. Mayor, NCBS 2 Anaesthetic response in Drosophila Ludwin PintoSeveral genetic loci that seems to be involved in the response of Drosophila to general anesthetics have been identified. These include G aBa receptor subtypes, channel proteins and several molecules crucial for maintaining membrane potential and synaptic function. The genetic interaction amongst these many loci is presently being assessed. 3 Peptides of therapeutic value from marine cone snails Hanumae Gowd, Benjamin Franklin and Santhana Ramasamy a previously unexplored source of drugs, the Conus species of marine snails with a repertoire of toxic peptides (referred to as conotoxins/conopeptides), are now being looked at as a shibire (b) and shibire stoned double (c) showing eye scar compared to wild type(a).

The highly specific conopeptides from Conus, once characterized, could be exploited as pharmacological tools in neuroscience and in search for drugs to treat many debilitating diseases. Conus forms the largest single genus of venomous animals with more than 700 species, each expressing approximately a hundred conopeptides. however, less than 0.5% of the active peptides in Conus venoms have been elucidated leaving much scope for toxin identification and characterization. in addition a large fraction of cone snail species is endemic to india. The highly structured cysteine rich peptides secreted by the venom gland of these carnivorous marine snails are secreted as a prepropeptide with a highly conserved superfamily-specific signal sequence and a highly variable C-terminal mature peptide. rather unusual post translational modifications and very specific cleavage of the mature peptide occur before the venom cocktail is steered to the storage sac while awaiting its target. There exists approximately 77 species of Conus in india of which many still remain to be characterized. The overall aim of this project lies in identifying, isolating and characterizing conopeptides from indian cone snails. We have isolated many novel peptides from a few cone snail species collected off the shores of South Eastern india and T iFr. Mass spectrometry-based de novo sequencing was performed on conotoxin Mo 1274 isolated from a vermivorous Cone snail Conus monile. The electron capture dissociation technique was used to identify and localize the tryptophan residues undergoing bromination. The experimentally determined sequence was validated by chemical derivatization and protease digestion followed by mass spectrometry. Classification of this peptide into the T-1 family of conotoxins was done based on the observation that the two disulfides of Mo 1274 connect cysteine and from Conus lorosii and Conus amadis were successfully synthesized. The synthetic peptides have been shown to fold like their natural counterparts and also to exhibit large effects on Voltage gated calcium channels.Collaborator: P . Balaram and S.

The assay is currently being carried out with both synthetic and natural Vi1369 peptides. attempts are underway to identify the molecular targets of these peptides. in an attempt to generate a phylogenetic tree of indian cone snails, sequences obtained from the COi, Calmodulin and 16s rrna of nearly thirty Conus sp have been obtained and are being analysed.

This resulted in the identification of 4 new species, thereby increasing the number of Conus species of india from 77 to 81. With a long term study of the distribution of Conidae along the entire indian coast, with its diverse habitats, these additional new species could be identified thereby paving way to the isolation of even more novel conopeptides. a morphology and morphometric analysis of radular teeth from 22 species of Conus snails (collected from the East and West coast of india) resulted in the development of a simplified species identification method based on tooth morphology. Partial characterization of Conus araneosus venom was done using rP- hPLC, ESi-MS and M aLDi-TOF-TOF. Biological assays were carried out for 5 peptides from C.araneosus to study analgesic and aggression scores in mouse and rats. a sleep inducing peptide has been identified from the venom of C.araneosus. Currently we have an inventory of nearly fifty toxin peptides at various stages of identification, characterization and chemical synthesis.Collaborators: Anthony Fernando and Olivia Fernando, Annamalai University and P . Balram, Indian Institute broad aim of my laboratory is to provide an understanding of the molecular mechanisms of endocytosis in metazoan cells. in this regard we have undertaken to develop a framework to understand principles of membrane organization and deformation in living cells. For scientists interested in studying phenomena at the cellular scale, principles from the physical and chemical sciences provide a powerful paradigm in framing questions about the mechanisms of movement of molecules and organelles inside cells. Consequently, we have taken a multi-disciplinary approach, combining biology with theoretical physics and synthetic chemistry, to address the main theme of our research at nCBS. We have developed new microscopy techniques to study nanometer scale organization of cellular components. Using fluorescence microscopy we have explored sorting properties and endocytic pathways of a variety of molecules, including membrane proteins, lipids and lipid-tethered proteins, both in living cells in tissue culture and in vivo. Our method of choice is to study the organization and dynamics of fluorescently-tagged molecules at different scales in living cells; from the nanometer scale in specialized domains in cell membranes to the micron scale prevalent in mapping endocytic pathways or in specialized regions of the cell surface. We are now involved in several lines of inquiry, some continuing and others more recently configured. These include: i) continuing studies on understanding structure and function of membrane rafts, in collaboration with Prof. Madan rao at raman research institute, Bangalore; ii) continuing studies on understanding the mechanism of dynamin-independent endocytosis using specific targeted molecular perturbations coupled with high resolution microscopy and single-molecule biochemistry; iii) genome-wide rnai-based screening of genes involved in dynamin-dependent and independent forms of endocytosis in Drosophila cells; iv) functional genomics of different endocytic pathways in the context of their role in a metazoan system capable of genetic manipulation, in collaboration with Prof. KS Krishnan, T iFr, Mumbai; v) exploring pathways of antigen presentation for loading onto MhC class ii, and endocytic mechanisms that modulate the presence of long-term cell surface resident proteins. The trajectory of this work has led us to explore the fine structure of the plasma membrane, providing for the first time an in vivo picture of lipidic assemblies challenging existing notions of membrane rafts, an understanding of the cellular basis for the establishment of developmental gradients, and novel pathways for antigen presentation, long-term cell surface resident protein modulation.Mechanisms of endocytosis in metazoan cells mayor@ncbs.res.inSATYAJIT MAYOR Scales of organization in metazoans, integrating biology with physics and chemistry. Starting at the scale of molecules, molecular players interact to generate larger scale structures in the context of cells (e. g. membrane rafts). These in turn participate to create processes at the cellular scale (e. g. pathways of endocytosis). Several endocytic pathways function to regulate phenomenon at the next level of organization (e. g. information transfer at neuronal synapses, morphogen gradients to specify tissue patterns or control cell signalling outputs in the larger multicellular organism). Focussing on the mechanism of a basic cellular process, namely endocytosis, studies in my laboratory using functional genomics are aimed at integrating different scales of organization in biology.

Chirality-induced raft-mediated mechanism Subhashri Ghosh and Riya RaghupathyOur concept of the structure and organization of the membrane of cells has undergone major revisions from the time of the fluid mosaic model proposed by Singer and nicolson. instead of considering the membrane as a 'two-dimensional oriented solution of integral proteins in a viscous phospholipid bilayer', both protein and lipid components of the bilayer are anisotropically arranged in the lateral and vertical directions. in living cells, it has been difficult to visualize these heterogeneities. Lateral heterogeneities variously called membrane rafts or domains, have been particularly difficult to visualize, and the most compelling evidence for such structures in the undifferentiated plasma membrane of cells is functional. With the help of theoretical (condensed matter) physicist Prof. Madan rao, we are probing the architecture of these lateral heterogeneities and the basis for their formation. These studies have required the development of new tools of biophysics to study membrane heterogeneities in situ, and a new physico-chemical understanding of the properties of membranes in living cells. From an operational perspective we have focussed on understanding how an exoplasmic lipid-tethered protein [Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPi)-anchored proteins] is distributed in cell membranes. This has obvious implications for understanding the structure and function of lipidic assemblies in membranes. Our work provides a fundamentally different picture of the structure and formation of lipid rafts, summarized in the adjoining Figure 1. We believe that these approaches will provide an understanding of how local membrane composition and physical properties of membranes are maintained and regulated in living cells. Collaborator: Madan Rao, Raman Research Institute, Bangalore 2 Mechanism of GPI-anchored proteins via a Chadda and Sudha KumariGPi-anchored proteins are a large class of proteins of extreme diversity in structure and function; 10% of all membrane proteins are tethered to the membrane via a GPi-anchor. Several receptors and pathogenic molecules depend on the presence of the GPi-anchor for their function. For example, the main mammalian folate receptor requires the GPi-anchor for efficient delivery of folate into cells. Understanding the nature of sorting of GPi- anchored proteins thus, has implications for physiology and pathology of a large fraction of membrane proteins. We had discovered that GPi-anchored proteins are sorted at the cell surface of mammalian cells into a Cdc42-regulated, clathrin and dynamin-independent endocytic pathway that is also a major pathway for the internalization of the fluid-phase into most cells (Figure 2). We have termed this pathway, the GPi-anchored protein enriched early endosomal (GEEC) pathway. Changing specific lipid levels in cells affects the sorting of the GPi-anchored proteins in endosomes, and at the cell surface, altering the efficiency of endocytic uptake. These data and others indicate that GPi-anchored proteins may exist as pre-sorted microdomains or rafts in membranes of endosomes which in turn are responsible Figure 1. Actively generated spatial and temporal organization of raft components: Data from our laboratory regarding physical characteristics of nanoscale clusters of GPi-anchored proteins in living cells show that these structures are small, dynamic, and co-exist with monomers; they are also distributed in a non-random fashion on the surface of cells. These structures may be actively induced to form large-scale stable 'rafts'. These studies provide a different picture of membrane rafts where GPi-anchored proteins form nano-scale lipid assemblies in specific regions of the plasma membrane which in turn may determine local lipid composition. Black circles, GPi-anchored proteins; red and pink circles, non-raft associated lipids; yellow circles, raft-associated lipids; green, for GPI-anchored proteins and the fluid-phase We are now utilizing an rnai-based, high content, high throughput microscopy strategy to uncover molecular players involved in the pathway of endocytosis of GPi-anchored proteins. For this purpose we have developed a custom-built microscopy platform centred on a multi-well slide assay format for quantitative analysis of uptake of multiple probes for different endocytic pathways in cells grown in the presence of individual rnai spotted onto a single well, spanning fluid-phase Of the many pathways of internalization available at the cell surface, GPi-anchored proteins are predominantly internalized via a specific class of pinosomes called GEECs, by a clathrin and dynamin-independent mechanism in tissue culture mammalian fibroblasts and primary hemocytes from Drosophila. for their specific sorting function. Currently studies in the laboratory are focused on understanding molecular mechanisms and sorting principles utilized by GPi-anchored proteins. 3 Genome-wide RNAi screening of genes involved in dynamin-dependent and independent forms of endocytosis in Drosophila cells.Gagan Gupta, Gautam Dey and M.G. Swetha The prevalence of the GEEC pathway in Drosophila cells has opened up an opportunity to examine genes involved in this type of endocytosis using a relatively simple genome-wide rnai perturbation strategy. To do this, we have established high content and high throughput assays based primarily on imaging of endocytic uptake in cultured cells from Drosophila (Figure 3). We have focussed on two major membrane pathways, dynamin-dependent endocytosis and membrane organization in Drosophila, a metazoan system capable of genetic Swetha, Debanjan Goswami and Riddhi MajumdarThe availability of the tools of genetics in a metazoan system such as Drosophila provide a unique opportunity to examine the form and function of endocytosis and membrane organization in the context of a whole animal. Using primary cell cultures from Drosophila, originally established in the laboratory, a variety of endocytic processes may be analyzed at high resolution. We have focused on two major membrane trafficking pathways, endocytosis at the cell surface and understanding biogenesis of lysosomes, and expanded our study to the organization of the cholesterol-tethered morphogen, the hedgehog protein. NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 56 7/10/08 5:33:50 PM57Our aim is, firstly, to relate alteration in cellular trafficking pathways to mutations in specific genes in the hope of uncovering molecular machinery behind these basic cellular processes, and secondly, to relate alterations in trafficking processes to perturbations in integrative processes in the whole animal such as those involved in establishing developmental gradients and control of intracellular signaling. at the level of membrane protein organization and its functional implications we have studied the organization of the hedgehog (hh) morphogen. These studies have suggested a hierarchical organization of a membrane protein, from the nano to the micron-scale. This organization contributes to distinct functionality of a diffusible morphogen. We have found that hh forms nanoscale clusters, determined by specific residues in its protein domain, and these clusters in turn organize to larger scale structures that participate in transporting the hh protein over many cell diameters. Collaborator: K.S. Krishnan, NCBS 5 Understanding pathways of antigen presentation for loading onto MHC class II and endocytic mechanisms that modulate the cell surface presence of long-term resident surface proteinsSudha Kumari antigen presentation is an essential function of the immune system in its ability to deal with infections. in this regard the presentation of soluble antigen to cells of the immune system has a central role.We have been studying processes of antigen presentation which utilize cytosolic pathways of antigen generation and MhC Class ii restricted presentation. We succeeded in identifying intracellular sites of this pivotal event in antigen presentation, after providing the antigen to antigen presenting cells (aPC) in different ways - as free peptides, or as a fusion constructs. This pathway is likely to be extremely important in mechanisms of generating tolerance of CD4+ T-cells to self-antigens. in addition to our ongoing studies on antigen presentation, we have used the cells of the immune system to study how cell surface levels of long-term resident membrane proteins may be acutely modulated. here we have focused on: a) the role of the hiV Nef protein on the immune co-stimulatory molecules, CD8O and CD86; b), endogenous mechanisms by which the acetylcholine receptor is modulated by autoimmune antibodies and ligands.Collaborators: Satyajit Rath, National Institute of Immunology, New sarina@ncbs.res.in The regulation of cell number is critical for the normal development of multicellular organisms. Molecular mechanisms regulating cellular death processes are largely evolutionarily conserved in metazoans. as in several other systems, the regulated depletion of cells is critical for the maintenance of immune system homeostasis. in the mammalian immune system, the bulk of circulating T-cells activated as a consequence of encounter with antigen are fated to die [via a programmed pathway of death or apoptosis] with only a small subset of antigen-reactive cells set aside to generate immune memory. Thus, expansion and reduction in cell number are recurring events in the immune system. Several aspects of this process can be recapitulated in vitro and offer an attractive model system to investigate the molecular underpinnings of cellular homeostatic mechanisms. activated T-cell apoptosis is regulated by the Bcl-2 family, comprising both pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. reactive oxygen species are also key intermediates of T-cell death. Specifically, we are probing signaling events that regulate pro-death cascades; the interactions of the latter with cellular survival machinery and the consequences of this for T-cell function. Some of our recent experiments are described in the sections that follow.Mechanisms of apoptosisAPURV A SARIN Srivastava, S., Banerjee, H., Chaudhry, A., V., Durdik, J.M. and Rath, S.

Evidence for a role for notch signaling in the cytokine-dependent survival of activated T-cells. rVa T-cell survival P . Divya and B. GeethaSignaling via the transmembrane receptor notch regulates several aspects of metazoan development. in the context of T-cells, notch signaling regulates commitment to the T-cell lineage. Subsequently, in the early stages of T-cell activation, signaling via notch facilitates the immune response to infection by regulating the cytokine interleukin-2 ( iL-2) receptor expression. iL-2 functions not only as a growth factor, promoting T-cell proliferation and survival, but also primes T-cells activated by self-antigens for death. T-cell activation is accompanied by increased processing of notch and consequently notch signaling. Since iL-2 drives both survival and death, we asked if notch biases iL-2 signaling towards either one of these outcomes in activated T-cells. activated T-cells express high levels of iL-2r and can be maintained in culture in the cytokines iL-2, iL-15 or iL-7. Disrupting notch processing resulted in T-cell apoptosis which could not be inhibited by any of the aforementioned cytokines. This indicated that concurrent signaling from notch and cytokine receptors was required for activated T-cell survival. Further in both activated CD4 + and CD8+ subsets of T-cells, notch inhibited the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (r OS), enhanced expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL and positively regulated the pro-survival kinase akt/PKB signaling. These observations were confirmed by the ectopic expression of the notch intracellular domain or in activated T-cell subsets enriched for notch expression. Collectively, the experiments implicated notch signaling in the cytokine-dependent survival of activated T-cells (Figure 1).2 Notch signaling regulates Bax function Lakshmi R. PerumalsamyDuring apoptosis of activated T-cells as well as several other cell types, the pro-apoptotic molecule Bax undergoes a conformational change consistent with its activation and apoptotic activity. as discussed in the preceding section, notch regulated activated T-cell survival and therefore we asked if notch signaling converged on the regulation of Bax activation in T-cells. The conformational change in Bax is revealed by a conformation specific antibody (clone 6a7), which recognizes an epitope in the n-terminus. Thus, 6a7 reactivity is detected in activated T-cells undergoing neglect-induced death (Figure 2, upper panel). Further, cells treated with a gamma secretase inhibitor (GSi) which blocks notch processing also presented 6a7 reactivity (Figure 2 lower panel) consistent with the activation of Bax and subsequent induction of apoptosis. notch regulation of Bax activation was also demonstrable in mammalian cell lines. Ectopically expressed Bax tagged to green fluorescent protein (Bax-GFP) coalesces into large clusters several of which overlap with mitochondria, which can be visualized by expressing Mito-Dsr ed (Figure 3, upper panel). Co-expressing notch restored diffuse, cytoplasmic localization of Bax and prevented Figure 1. The model summarizes outcomes of perturbing Notch signaling in activated T-cells. notch activity positively regulates cell survival, inhibiting the production of reactive oxygen species (r OS) and converging on the activation of the serine-threonine kinase akt/ PKB and upregulation of expression undergoing neglect-induced apoptosis and following perturbation of Notch processing. activated T-cells stained for a conformationally active form of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax [clone 6a7] in conditions of cytokine-deprivation or neglect induced death [ani D, upper panel] or following treatment with a gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSi-X) that blocks notch processing in 5\u00b5m. NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 59 7/10/08 5:33:52 mitochondria (Figure lower panel). Similarly inhibition of Bax activation and apoptosis was also observed in cells expressing a processed (activated) form of the notch intracellular domain. Taken together, these and experiments demonstrated that notch signaling inhibited Bax activation and oligomerization, thereby regulating a key antagonist of activated T-cell survival. 3 The serine-threonine kinase Akt Parikh, Lakshmi R. Perumalsamy and D. VaigundanBax function is negatively regulated by mechanisms that promote its retention in the cytosol and by anti-apoptotic molecules such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-x L that antagonize Bax function at the mitochondrion. The Bax n-terminus had been implicated in its localization to mitochondria and the triggering of cytotoxicity. While, the B h3 domain regulates interactions within the family, it is becoming increasingly apparent that regions other than the B h3 contribute to Bax function. in recent experiments we showed that the B h3 and TM1 domains in Bax are adequate for association with Bcl-xL and localization to mitochondria respectively, but an intact n-terminus played a non- redundant role in the regulation of Bax cytotoxicity by Bcl-xL. Earlier work from our laboratory had shown that the kinases akt and MEK target a region in the Bax n-terminus to ensure its cytoplasmic sequestration in T-cells. Thus, we asked if Bcl-xL and akt regulate Bax via similar mechanisms as Bax- induced apoptosis is inhibited by the serine-threonine kinase akt. a site-directed substitution mutant of Bax with alanine substitutions of the Ser/Thr residues (T14, S 15, S 16) in the n-terminus (Bax-ala3) was refractory to inhibition by constitutively active C a-akt (Figure 4a). interestingly, the modification in the n-terminus did not interfere with Bcl-xL inhibition of Bax-ala3 induced apoptosis (Figure 4b) giving the first indications that the two anti-apoptotic pathways target Bax function via distinct mechanisms. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 4c, C a-akt did not change the Bax function by distinct mechanisms. a & b, apoptosis triggered by expressing the recombinant proteins indicated in the panels. c, active-akt does not regulate the subcellular distribution of the Bax mutant, Bax-ala3. hEK cells expressing Bax-ala-3GFP and Dsr ed2-Mito in the absence [upper panel] or of [lower panel]. Scale 3. Ectopically expressed full-length Bax function. Bax-GFP around mitochondria [marked with the Dsred2-Mito] in apoptotic cells. When co-expressed with notch-FL, Bax-GFP focus of my laboratory is to identify the molecular mechanisms that organize mitochondria and regulate its function in an organism. The mitochondrial network in a cell is composed of branched tubular reticula interspersed with small kidney-bean shaped compartments. Mitochondrial remodeling involves a dynamic process of fission and fusion of the organelle essential for maintenance of the mitochondrial network and function. While fusion promotes inter-mitochondrial exchange of DNA and complementation of mtDNA mutations, fission enables distribution of mitochondria to discrete regions in the cell to perform specific functions. Defects in mitochondrial remodeling result in developmental defects, influence aging, neuro-degeneration and pathogenesis of human diseases caused by mtDNA mutations. We have taken a multi-disciplinary approach that exploits the genetic tools available in the fruit fly - Drosophila melanogaster , imaging techniques that enable real-time visualization of mitochondrial remodeling at a high resolution and biochemical analysis of isolated mitochondria to understand mitochondrial remodeling. Our studies have led to identification of novel mitochondrial proteins that regulate mitochondrial outer membrane fission and fusion (Figure). Using genetic mutants - and RNAi mediated knockdown - of these molecular players, the role of mitochondrial remodeling during cell division and in programmed cell death is being investigated. Cells defective in mitochondrial fission are protected from multiple apoptotic stimuli in vivo and ex vivo . At the level of the organism, developmental programmed cell death is reduced in these mutant animals resulting in tissue hyperplasia.Mechanisms of mitochondrial remodelingV.

Using high resolution fluorescence microscopy of genetically encoded GFP that is targeted to mitochondria or fluorescent dyes that are preferentially retained in the mitochondria, the number, cross sectional area and aspect ratio (shape) of mitochondria have been determined in vivo and ex vivo. Using time lapse imaging, mitochondrial fission and fusion have been characterized in primary larval hemocyte cultures that are amenable to genetic manipulations and S2r + cells that are amenable to rnai mediated gene knock-down studies. Mitochondria in multiple cell types are tubular-reticular and undergo fission and fusion (Figure 1). 2 Identification and characterization of proteins involved in mitochondrial fusion Shamik Banerjee, Tejas Gupte, Ruchika Anand and S. KokilavaniBiochemical and genetic studies performed in the laboratory led to the identification of candidate genes involved in mitochondrial remodeling. The role of 3 genes thus identified was studied in detail using rnai mediated knockdown of these genes individually in S2r + cells. Knock-down of these genes resulted in an increase in mitochondrial number and a concomitant decrease in mitochondrial cross sectional area and aspect ratio consistent with mitochondrial fragmentation. in order to test if fragmented mitochondrial morphology resulted from a defect in mitochondrial fusion, assays that monitor mitochondrial fusion were established using GFP and photo-activable GFP (PaGFP) that is targeted to the matrix of the mitochondria. GFP is photo-bleached in few mitochondria of the cell. The fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FraP) in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors is monitored with time and reflected exchange of GFP between mitochondria on fusion. in S2r + cells, P aGFP in a subset of mitochondria in a cell was photo-activated using a 405 nm laser and the redistribution of photo-activated P aGFP to other mitochondria monitored with time. Photo-activated PaGFP redistributed to majority of the mitochondria in the cell consistent with mitochondrial fusion. Unlike in mock rnai treated cells, photo-activated P aGFP did not redistribute in S2r+ cells treated with rnai that targeted the candidate genes isolated in the screen described above (Figure 2). Thus fragmented mitochondrial morphology in these cells resulted from a defect in mitochondrial fusion. The mechanism by which these proteins orchestrate mitochondrial outer membrane fusion subsequent to tethering of mitochondria that in turn is mediated by Mitofusin is being investigated. 3 Mechanism of Mitofusin mediated tethering of mitochondria Tejas Gupte, that has two heptad repeats (hr1 and hr2) that are implicated in tethering of mitochondria prior to fusion. it is not clear how Mitofusin on adjacent mitochondria interact in vivo and result in fusion. in order to address this question, assays in a subset of mitochondria (green) in the cell (0 hr- i, iii) is redistributed to all the mitochondria (red) in the cell as a result of mitochondrial fusion (1 hr- ii, iv) in mock rnai (i, ii) but not in candidate gene specific rnai (iii, iv) cell cultures have been developed. a bioinfomatic approach was taken to identify candidate amino acids in the heptad repeats of Mitofusin (Marf) essential for either the parallel or the anti-parallel interaction of the coiled-coil domains. Using PC r based site directed mutagenesis; we are testing experimentally if the hr1 and hr2 domains in different Marf molecules interact in a parallel or an anti-parallel orientation during the process of mitochondrial fusion.Collaborators: R. Sowdhamini and S. Ambika (NCBS) 4 Mechanism of mitochondrial inheritance during cell division Tejas Gupte and Arun KumarThe mechanism by which mitochondria are partitioned into daughter cells during cell division is poorly understood. it has been recently suggested that mitochondrial function plays a critical role in regulating mitosis. The objective is to characterize mitochondrial segregation and its function during mitosis. Using mitochondria targeted fluorescent proteins, changes in mitochondrial dynamics and morphology have been determined during cell division in S2r + cells. Preliminary studies show that mitochondria undergo dramatic fission during pro-metaphase and subsequently fuse post cytokinesis. Studies on the role that changes in mitochondrial morphology play during cell division are underway using rnai mediated knockdown of molecular players that regulate mitochondrial fission and fusion (Figure 3). 5 Role of mitochondrial remodeling during programmed cell death Gaurav Goyal and Nagaraju DhanyasiMitochondrial remodeling is essential for Drosophila cells to undergo death. Developmental programmed cell death stimuli in vivo and multiple apoptotic stimuli ex vivo induce mitochondrial fragmentation upstream of caspase activation. Unlike genotoxic stress, a lipid cell death mediator induced an increase in mitochondrial contiguity prior to fragmentation of the mitochondria (Figure 4). Using genetic mutants of drp-1, we find that Drp-1 not only regulates mitochondrial fission in normal cells, but mediates mitochondrial fragmentation during programmed cell death. Mitochondria in drp- 1 mutants fail to fragment, resulting in hyperplasia of tissues in vivo and protection of cells from multiple apoptotic stimuli ex vivo. We are currently investigating the functional role of mitochondrial fragmentation and increase in mitochondrial contiguity in programmed cell death. The concentration of mitochondrial calcium and a TP in the cell is measured for this purpose. Collaborators: Richard J Youle, NINDS, NIH, USA and Apurva Sarin, NCBS 6 Analysis of mitochondrial distribution in cells collaboration with Madan rao and abhishek Chaudhary at raman research institute, we are involved in the design of a coarse grain model of mitochondrial distribution in cells that is based on experimentally measurable parameters. This work is aimed at uncovering possible rules that underlie mitochondrial organization and function in the cell at a macroscopic scale and aimed at a subsequent analysis at a microscopic scale of tethering. Over-expression of Mitofusin (Marf)-GFP mutant (ii) results in reduced clumping (tethering) of mitochondria (red) unlike what is observed cell death. Developmental programmed cell death drives mitochondrial fragmentation in the pre- pupal mid-gut (ii). The average mitochondrial cross sectional area is indicated. in ex vivo preparations, etoposide induces mitochondrial (green) fragmentation (iii) while lipids induce extensively tubular mitochondrial morphology (iv) prior to fragmentation and cell death.

We are specifically interested in the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (insP3) and its receptor - the insP3 receptor. This protein exists on the membranes of intracellular calcium stores and performs the dual function of a receptor for insP 3 and a channel for calcium release. When insP3 is generated in the cell, in response to an external stimulus, it binds to the insP3 receptor and releases calcium from internal stores. We address insP3 receptor function in the model organism Drosophila using genetic, molecular, cellular, electrophysiological and behavioral methods.Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate signaling in cellular and systemic physiologyGAITI HASAN Intracellular Ca2+ levels in isolated Drosophila neurons loaded with a calcium sensitive fluorescent dye (Fluo-4).Nair, S., Agrawal, N. and Hasan, G.

By altering intracellular Ca2+ levels through genetic means, we have shown that signaling through the insP3r is required at multiple steps for generating the neural circuit required in air-puff stimulated Drosophila flight. Decreased Ca2+ release in aminergic neurons during development of the flight circuit can be compensated by reducing Ca2+ uptake from the cytosol to intracellular stores. however, this mode of increasing intracellular Ca2+ is insufficient for maintenance of flight patterns over time periods necessary for normal flight. Our study suggests that processes such as maintenance of wing posture and formation of the flight circuit require insP 3 receptor function at a slow time scale and can thus be modulated by altering levels of cytosolic Ca2+ and insP3. in contrast maintenance of flight patterns probably requires fast modulation of Ca2+ levels, where the intrinsic properties of the insP3r play a pivotal role. InsP3R function in Drosophila is downstream of Gq and PLC Santanu Banerjee and Neha AgrawalinsP 3 in vertebrates is generated in two cellular contexts, either by the activation of PLC or PLC. interestingly, in Drosophila none of the itpr mutant phenotypes were enhanced by reducing PLC activity suggesting that this arm of the insP3 pathway maybe non-functional in invertebrates. From genetic interaction studies with newly generated mutants for Gq and existing mutants for PLC (plc21C alleles) we propose that activation of the insP 3r is primarily through Gq and PLC in Drosophila. all itpr mutant phenotypes, except for the maintenance of flight patterns, are enhanced in dgq; itpr double mutants and further expression of a a tetrameric intracellular calcium channel. it is an integral component of the insP3 signaling pathway in multicellular organisms, where it regulates cellular calcium dynamics in many different contexts. in order to understand how the primary structure of the insP3r affects its functional properties, the kinetics of Ca2+-release in vitro from single point mutants of the Drosophila insP3r have been determined earlier. among these, the Ka901 mutant in the putative selectivity-filter of the pore is of particular interest. it is non-functional in the homomeric form whereas it forms functional channels (with altered channel properties) when co-expressed with wild-type channels. We now show that due to its changed functional properties the Ka901 mutant protein has dominant negative effects in vivo. Cells expressing Ka901:WT channels exhibit much higher levels of cytosolic Ca 2+ upon stimulation as compared with cells over-expressing just the wild-type DminsP3r, thus supporting our in vitro observations that increased Ca2+ release is a property of heteromeric Ka901:WT channels. Furthermore, ectopic expression of the Ka901 mutant channel in aminergic cells of Drosophila alters electrophysiological properties of a flight circuit and results in defective flight behavior.

Current Science, 89, 1220- 1229.Selected publicationsOrganisms show a fascinating variety of traits that allow them to survive and reproduce in nature. how do these adaptations work, and why are they so variable? To answer these questions one must understand evolution, because traits evolve over generations based on a trade-off between benefits and costs. Equally, one must understand ecology, because it is on the ecological stage that the evolutionary play is enacted. My particular interests include understanding the evolutionary ecology of conflict between individuals, both within species and between species. Conflicts of interest arise when an individual behaves in a way that is not optimal for others. i have studied conflicts within family- groups, and currently work on conflicts between brood parasites and their hosts. Conflicts of interest are also widespread when males and females make reproductive decisions. Sexual selection, the framework within which such decisions are studied, remains an interest of mine. i am also interested in the application of evolutionary thinking (adaptation, trade-offs, conflicts of interests, life-history strategies) to ecological questions: What are the population consequences of environmental change? how do inducible defences affect population trajectories? What are the causes and consequences of invasions by non-native species into new environments? My approach in tackling these questions is to combine theory with empirical work. Formal modelling focusses hypotheses and predictions, and forces unstated assumptions into the open; empirical tests of predictions lead to refined models of how the world works. i intend that members of my lab work in a diversity of systems: terrestrial and aquatic, plant and animal. We conduct observations and experiments in the field; and, where greater control is required, in artificial environments, mimicking natural conditions as closely as possible.Evolutionary ecology aDEr1 Antagonistic co-evolution: brood parasites and their hosts This work focusses on the strategies shown by avian brood parasites and the counter-strategies of their hosts. Brood parasites lay their eggs in the nests of other species, thereby taking advantage of the parental efforts of the hosts. What explains the large variation in virulence of avian brood parasites? What adaptations make brood parasites successful at their deception? how do parasitic chicks manage to manipulate their foster parents into providing for them? and, on the other hand, what defences do hosts have against brood parasites? 2 Individual adaptations and population ecology: mosquito behaviour and population dynamics Overall population change results from variation in the survival and reproduction of individuals. The more we understand this variation, the better we will be able to predict future population change. For this, we need to study the evolved tactics of individuals to survive and reproduce, and how these tactics are influenced by the environment. When predation risk and competition vary in space, how do female mosquitoes decide where to lay their eggs? how do larvae adjust their behavioural and life- history tactics? Can we incorporate this information into our models to better understand population dynamics? 3 Causes and consequences of invasions: the ecology and evolution of invasive species Species that have successfully colonised new environments provide a wonderful opportunity to study the evolutionary process of adaptation, and the ecological process of competition and its consequences. What makes invasive species successful: release from ecological constraints (pathogens, predators, competitors), or rapid adaptation? What effects do invasives have on native species, and through what mechanisms? Does a detailed understanding of the evolution and ecology of problem species allow us to design better control measures?

NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 71 7/10/08 5:34:07 PMThe indian subcontinent is a fascinating place. Bound by mountain ranges to the north, the northeast and the northwest and by ocean to the south, this peninsula is home to incredible biodiversity. Data on species distributions suggests that the indian subcontinent is a sink for species from other regions, with some of its own native species. if the indian subcontinent is a sink, this should be mirrored in the genetic diversity of species found here, which would be lower (and relatively recent) compared to that of the same species elsewhere. We seek to investigate the distribution and partitioning of genetic diversity for various mammalian species in the indian subcontinent, and investigate processes that drive patterns of genetic diversity across space and time. We also strive to apply molecular methods to address important issues in the conservation of endangered species. Using field-collected samples, molecular genetic tools and computationally intensive analyses, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of populations and species, and predict the driving forces in their future evolution. We have spent the last year discovering diversity in north-eastern india. Our research has identified the phylogenetic affiliations of the newly discovered arunachal macaque, two species of barking deer not known from india (leaf deer: James et al., in press; black muntjac) and allowed us to infer ancestry in northeastern native human populations. We have investigated genetic variability among tigers in india, and find that tigers outside retain much less variability than do tigers within india. The genetic data also reveal a very recent, possibly human induced, population decline. We are currently investigating genetic variability in leopards, jungle cats, bonnet and arunachal macaques and house mice. Finally, we have excavated fossil rodents from a Pleistocene site in Southern india, Kurnool caves, and are currently characterizing change in small mammal communities through time. in our attempts to conserve species, we have developed methods to identify tigers and leopards individually from non-invasive samples. We are currently applying these methods to estimate population density for tigers in Karnataka.

Over the last couple of years, we have applied molecular approaches to the discovery of biodiversity in this species rich region. a new species of primate, the arunachal macaque Macaca munzala, was described from northeastern india in 2005. Based on its appearance and distribution, the arunachal macaque was hypothesized to be closely related to M. assamensis and M. thibetana. Molecular analyses in our laboratory established the distinct identity of the species and indicate a time of origin of c. 0.48 mya. Surprisingly, maternally inherited markers reveal close phylogenetic affinities with the Southern indian bonnet macaque (M. radiata), while the Y chromosome revealed shared ancestry with the geographically closer assamese and thibetan macaques, possibly mediated by ancestral male introgression. Morphometric analyses reiterate similarity between M. munzala and its neighbors, presumably resulting from convergent evolution under similar ecological conditions. We are continuing research on the arunachal macaque, and are investigating population structure and demographic history using mitochondrial Dna and microsatellite variation. The leaf deer Muntiacus putaoensis was discovered in Myanmar and its presence in eastern arunachal Pradesh, india, was subsequently confirmed based on morphometric analyses of two skulls collected from local hunters. however, ambiguity remained regarding several other partial skulls and dried skin samples collected during subsequent surveys. We developed molecular genetic analyses that can unambiguously identify muntjac species. analyses of the collected skins revealed the presence of three muntjac species in arunachal Pradesh: the indian muntjac, the leaf deer and the black muntjac. These results increased the muntjac diversity of the indian subcontinent from one (only the common muntjac) to three species. Further, it doubled the size of the leaf deer's east-west range. Our discovery of the black muntjac in this region are surprising given this species is previously known only from eastern China. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the indian population is reciprocally monophyletic with the Chinese population. Given genetic differences and current geographical isolation between these populations, we suggest that the indian population of the black muntjac be considered a management unit. Our research highlights the importance of molecular tools in facilitating the discovery of cryptic biodiversity as well as in determining conservation status of populations in such understudied regions.

Scientific conservation efforts thus far have focused on better understanding tiger ecology. a recent phylogeographic study revealed six subspecies of tigers, with moderate levels of genetic variation. Given that around 50% of the worlds tigers are in the indian subcontinent, we further investigated genetic variation in this region. So far, we have sampled 43 wild individuals from across the indian subcontinent. Sequence data from 1.3 Kbp for 57 individuals reveal much higher levels of genetic variation within india than previously suggested. When compared to tigers outside of india, we found that around 70% of all genetic variation was within the indian subcontinent. The additional diversity we discovered was because we collected non-invasive samples across tiger populations in india, unlike the previous study where sampling was geographically restricted. This result is especially relevant given that off the remaining global tiger habitat, less than 5% is occupied by indian tigers. We further investigated demographic history and used coalescent simulations to estimate the historical effective population size of tigers in the india. We are currently using microsatellite variation to characterize the severity of the very recent anthropogenic decline. in future research, we hope to extensively investigate population structure in the indian subcontinent, and use historical skin samples to investigate recently extinct genetic variants. We are also investigating population structure in other species in the indian subcontinent. For example, leopards are an interesting contrast to tigers in being relatively more adundant and widespread. Jungle cats and leopard cats are more abundant than leopards or tigers, but have very different habitat preferences. Bonnet macaques seem to be continuously distributed. We are currently investigating the effects of these ecological differences on genetic variation using microsatellite data from non-invasive samples. The house mouse is hypothesized to have evolved in the indian subcontinent. We have just initiated research investigating the phylogeography of the house mouse. in the future, we hope to investigate possible genetic signatures of increase in abundance with commensalism. Given that Mus musculus is a model system, we are very excited by this new research direction, as it will allow us to tap genomic resources and possibly examine genes directly involved in evolution. 3 Human population genetics Thejaswi Shivanadapart from being the only point of entry into peninsular india from east and southeast asia, northeast india is also a hotspot of linguistic and ethno-cultural diversity.

Genetic data included mitochondrial hVS1 sequences from these individuals and published data (over 1400 sequences) from other tribes in Meghalaya and other parts of this region. Our results reveal population growth among these tribes, contrary to most hunter-gatherer groups elsewhere across the world, and that ethno-religious tradition could be a significant isolating factor in geographically proximate populations. Using coalescent simulations we investigated divergence times between these tribes and those from peninsular india and southeastern China. Our simulations reveal that the northeast indian tribes could have colonized the region relatively recently, having a more recent shared ancestry with Chinese tribes than peninsular indian tribes. We propose that for human populations the northeast is best viewed as a sink rather than a corridor or barrier to gene flow. Collaborator: B.R.

Indrani Suryaprakash and Krishnapriya Tammain February of 2007, we excavated a cave site close to Kurnool, in andhra Pradesh, Southern india. Our initial explorations reveal that the materials we excavated represent a rich assemblage of small mammal fauna from this region. We are now in the process of dating layers in the excavated remains, cleaning and identifying the recovered small mammals jaws. We are also testing the feasibility of using the material we have recovered as a source of ancient Dna. Longer-term, we hope to use excavation materials like these to investigate how changes in climate have impacted the ecology and evolution of small mammal communities in the past in the indian subcontinent.Collaborators: Elizabeth Hadly, Stanford University and Anthony Barnosky, UC Berkeley, USA 5 Conservation genetics Samrat Mondol The survival of tigers in the indian subcontinent is threatened. in the recent years, non-invasive genetic samples like scat have served as an invaluable tool to study the population status of rare and elusive species. We have developed genetic methods to identify species, gender and individuals. We are currently working with scat samples collected in a mark-recapture framework to estimate population density in Bandipur national Park. Bandipur is a good site to test our methods, as Dr. Karanth and others at WCS have studied this population for many years, and have independent estimates of population density. in future research, we hope to extend the geographical scope of our research to the Western ghats in Karnataka. We hope to combine genetic and ecological research to investigate tiger habitat preference, tiger density in key regions, and connectivity between different parts of this landscape. We believe that such research will be critical for the conservation of tigers.

We are interested in deciphering mechanisms that ensure integrity of circuits within adult animals. What are the changes that must occur within individual neurons to maintain homeostasis and how do these properties change to allow plasticity? The Drosophila olfactory system presents several advantages that allows us to address these issues. The circuit which is composed of sensory neurons, local interneurons, projection neurons and modulatory neurons is anatomically well defined and is amenable to a range of genetic strategies available in the fly (Figure below). Odor quality is largely represented as a 3-dimensional spatial code in the brain and the basic cell types and underlying cellular organization is well described. Building upon this knowledge, we are now investigating how this collection of neurons function to result in behavior.Developmental Landraf, M., VijayRaghavan, K. and Rodrigues, V. ( 2007). Metamorphosis of an identified serotonergic neuron in the Drosophila olfactory system. Neural Development, 2, 20. The olfactory circuit in Drosophila indicating classes of neurons as well as (in green) P(Gal4) lines that mark them. Selected publication OniC a rODriGUES1 neural activity is necessary for maintenance of adult olfactory circuits Albert Chiang The mechanisms that underlie maintenance of adult circuits are not well understood in any system. The role of neural activity during development is better studied in the vertebrate olfactory system, where activity along with odorant receptor identity, specifies the combination of adhesive and repulsive cues that result in the maturation of the sensory map. We used a conditional system to express any of a panel of neural-activity blockers in the adult Drosophila olfactory neurons and observed a disruption of axonal terminals within antennal lobe glomeruli (Figure 1). To understand how activity maintains neural elements, we searched for molecules whose levels are regulated in an activity-dependent manner and identified the homophilic adhesion molecules Fas2, n-Cadherin and neuroglian. in the presynaptic terminals of olfactory receptor neurons, where synaptic function is blocked, Fas2 and neuroglian are upregulated while n-Cadherin is downregulated. Our results suggest that the maintenance of sensory inputs to the glomerular map is an active process in vivo, requiring neural activity during adulthood. in order to link activity to cell adhesion molecules, we have initiated a screen using U aS-rnai lines kindly provided by ryu Ueda at the national institute of Genetics, Japan and by Barry Dickson at the research institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna. We have obtained some candidate genes whose 'knock-down' in sensory neurons or in glial cells results in synapse withdrawal or degeneration. These are being investigated currently. Collaborator: K. VijayRaghavan, NCBS 2 Re-modeling of an identified serotonergic neuron during pupal life is regulated by activity and Wingless signaling Bidisha Roy and Ajeet P . Singh it is likely that many of the mechanisms employed during metamorphosis of neurons are shared with those involved in adult plasticity and may also provide knowledge about neural degeneration. We therefore decided to examine molecular mechanisms that control the re-modeling of a wide-field serotonergic neuron in the Drosophila olfactory pathway which undergoes dramatic changes from larva to adult. Modification of a larval neuron into its adult-specific form is regulated by steroid hormone receptors, neuronal activity, signalling through the Wingless pathway and Ephrins (Figure 2). These studies establish a cellular system for studying how extrinsic cues interact with autonomous signals to pattern complex cellular architecture. Parallel studies aimed at deciphering the function of this neuron will link anatomy to the development of olfactory behaviour. Collaborator: K.

NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 77 7/10/08 5:34:11 PM3 Mechanisms of Short-term and in olfactory pathway Sudeshna Das, Avni Gandhi and Somdatta Karnik We have devised behavioral paradigms that allow us to study two forms of non-associative memory which we term Long Term habituation (LT h) and Short Term habituation (ST h). in LT h, newly eclosed flies are exposed for several days to the odor of benzaldehyde or to Carbon dioxide. The normal repulsive response to these stimuli is severely diminished and recovers only after eight to ten days. ST h, on the other hand is more robustly measured in larvae where five minute pre-exposure to odorants results in a drop in response which recovers within an hour. We are dissecting the cellular basis of these behavioral observations using P(Gal4) lines that allow us to manipulate the properties of individual cells within the circuit. Electrophysiological studies and functional imaging techniques from several laboratories suggest that local interneurons serve to integrate information among different glomeruli suggesting that these could be the substrates for generation of LT h and ST h. We have initiated an analysis using the mosaic analysis with repressible cell marker (M arCM) method to study the lineage and architecture of individual local interneurons (Ln) (Figure 3). The presence of a Or-GFP fusion constructs in the background of the Gal4 line that marks Ln allows us to trace arborizations to individual identified 3b).

There are several reported examples of chemical cues triggering diverse behavior patterns that can be modified within short timescales. We have initiated experiments to study the development and function of the olfactory system in the ant Campotonus sericeus which relies heavily on olfaction for its lifestyle. antibodies against Drosophila synaptic proteins label synapses in the ant brain and allowed us to visualize the organization of the olfactory lobe in different castes (Figure 4). Unlike that in flies, the olfactory lobe of ants shows sexual dimorphism - the male has a macroglomerulus, presumably involved in detection of sex pheromones and about 75 smaller glomeruli. The worker on the other hand, has about 175 glomeruli of similar size and the queen possesses 115 glomeruli. A\u0000 B\u0000Figure 3.

We use Drosophila for our studies of emerging behavior, since Drosophila provides us with a wealth of genetic tools and reagents with which to study the development and function of the nervous system. We focus our investigation on the embryo because this is the developmental stage when neural circuits begin to mature and the coordinated outputs that drive movement first appear. Our aims at this stage are 1) to identify genes essential for the normal development of movement 2) to identify elements of the neural circuitry underlying locomotor movements 3) to investigate the emergence of function in the motor system and how this is controlled. We have completed our first level of genetic analysis by showing that patterns of movement that are specific to particular body regions are specified by the local expression of hox genes (Dixit et al 2008). Loss of hox gene function leads to a loss of the normal pattern of local movement; gain of function leads to the ectopic expression of movements characteristic of a different body region. We conclude that hox genes regulate the region specific differentiation of neural networks that drive coordinated movement and a major challenge now is to translate this finding into a deeper understanding of how such control is exerted at a cellular and molecular level. at the same time a major screen aimed at identifying components of the motor circuitry that are essential for specific patterns of movement has been carried out using a loss of function approach. The results of this screen are promising: a large number of lines that are either paralysed or show defective patterns of behavior when tetanus toxin is targeted to specific subsets of neurons has been identified. Many of the neuronal subsets identified in this way are relatively small and restricted and should allow us to catalogue and manipulate essential components of both locomotor circuitry and its upstream control. This work is complemented by and interacts with work in Cambridge that is particularly concerned with the progressive emergence of coordinated movement in late embryogenesis. This work indicates an essential role for neural activity in the proper development of coordinated movement. This finding is reflected at a cellular level by the discovery of an apparently homeostatic mechanism that regulates the growth of postsynaptic elements of motor circuitry in response to the level of synaptic input they receive. We conclude that the developing motor circuitry shows an unexpected degree of plasticity that allows for compensation in the face of naturally occurring variability.Primary affiliation: Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, UK adjunct faculty 79 NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 79 7/10/08 5:34:12 PMSelected publications vijay@ncbs.res.inNerves, muscles and the development of behaviourK. VIJAYRAGHA V AN Our laboratory is interested in understanding the mechanisms underlying development and assembly of the network-comprising nerves, muscles and tendons - responsible for the ability of animals to move from one place to another by crawling, walking or flying. Our approach is to analyze this problem - using genetic and molecular tools - by first understanding the mechanisms that specify the birth of motor neurons, their morphogenesis and relationship to their input neurons and target muscles. This cellular analysis has begun to yield results on the developmental genetic basis underlying the construction of hardware. We are, in parallel, addressing which aspects of the network are essential for function and, importantly, the ways in which function is robust, and resilient to perturbations in structure and development. These experiments have required the careful development of assays of locomotor behaviour. alterations in behaviour upon induced changes in gene expression in sensory-or motor-neurons are then measured to understand how 'function' is built into the network during development.

We address the following questions: What are the developmental origins of motor neurons? are they all parts of one or a few neural lineages or are they selected from several lineages and specified individually? Our results demonstrate that motor neurons of the leg arise primarily from two groups of cells: one born during the embryonic phase of neurogenesis and the other during post- embryonic development. Thus far, analysis of the embryonic born motor neurons shows that three motor neurons innervate three distinct muscles sets of the leg (Figure 1). These identified neurons are being followed from larval to adult development in order to understand their development in relation to their targets.Collaborators: David Brierly and Darren Williams, King's College, UK 2 Understanding the walking-fly Sudhir Pallayil, Swetha, B., and Umashankar The long-term goals of the project are to identify the neuronal elements that are required for walking in Drosophila and how they are assembled during development. We have devised assays to analyze walking behavior in different levels of detail. The gross parameters, such as speed and rate of turning. are obtained using a video-tracking arena. at a finer level, we examine the footprints of a fly, left behind on a soot- covered glass plate, which allows us to look at step length, leg positioning, and co-ordination. For further detail, we examine an immobilized fly rotating a Styrofoam ball (Figure 2). in this assay, we can obtain additional parameters such as gait-, inter-leg co-ordination and inter-segment co-ordination. Using these assays, we have studied the behavior of the mature adult, newly emerged adults, animals with legs amputated and animals with parts of the nervous system functionally silenced with tetanus toxin. These experiments, as yet in early stages, will help us develop a picture of how the development of the leg motor system is related to its function in the adult. We have also generated a range of genetic tools that allow us to affect the function and gene-expression in defined sets of neurons. When used in our behavior assays we expect these tools to help us develop an understanding of how segment- specific wiring of function, results in co-ordinated walking. to understand the development of locomotion in Drosophila larva. Our study has two aspects: the analysis of rhythmic peristaltic movement patterns in the embryo and the crawling motion of the larva after hatching which the embryonic movement prefigures. Our aims are to identify the neuronal components of central pattern generators and examine the mechanisms underlying the functional development of larval locomotor behaviour. We speculate that the locomotor network is repeated in a segmental fashion along the antero- posterior axis of the larva. Our working hypothesis is that segmental variants of a fundamental circuit plan will be dictated by the action of the homeotic genes. in order to test the importance of segment identity, we have carried out studies involving loss - as well as gain - of function of homeotic genes of the bithorax (BX-C) and antennapedia (ant-C). results obtained suggest that either Ultrabithorax (Ubx) or abdominal-A (abdA), two genes of bithorax complex (BX-C) are necessary and sufficient to dictate the characteristic movements that are associated with peristaltic locomotion. in order to dissect the minimal neuronal components underlying peristaltic behaviour, a functional screen is being carried out. Using the GAL4 system to silence neurons we identify lines with narrow expression domains in the nervous system but impaired peristaltic movements. in addition to this, we also identify GAL4 lines in which the control of larval crawling on substrate is affected in multiple Figure 1.

Guruharsha The myoblast attractant gene dumbfounded ( duf; also called kirre) is an important player during myoblast fusion in Drosophila. it is specifically expressed in specialized set of cells called founder myoblasts that seed the formation of muscles. Using a combination of in silico approaches, we have identified potential cis-regulatory elements in the sequence upstream of duf coding region. Putative binding sites for several transcription factors and nuclear effectors of major signaling pathways were found clustered and phylogenetically conserved in this region. Systematic deletion analysis of the duf- regulatory region using reporter constructs revealed specific aspects of duf regulation during Drosophila myogenesis. We find several distinct, independent and non- cumulative enhancer modules- that regulate duf expression in specific muscle founder cells of the embryo and the adult. While embryonic enhancers are proximal, adult-specific enhancers are located more distal to the duf start site. These results merited a further, detailed computational study of the duf enhancer region. The results have complemented our study by identifying enhancer modules and transcription factors whose predicted binding regions match with our deletion analysis. We demonstrate the complexity of duf gene regulation and examine this in the context of Bioinformatics and Chi P-on-Chip studies. These reveal contexts where the predictive and Chi P-on-Chip approaches have great value and others where, clearly, more information is needed before predictive tools can be applied.

These studies implicate Wsp as playing a role during myoblast fusion in adult muscle development and provides a genetic handle for the identification of other interacting molecules involved in myoblast fusion (Figure 4).Collaborators: Eyal Schjeter and Ben-Zion Shilo, Weizmann Israel and tendon cells Prabhat Tiwari and Arun KumarThe mechanisms by which developing muscles and tendon- precursors interact to form precise myotendonous junctions, essential for correct movement, has been poorly investigated in vertebrates but examined substantially in Drosophila. Studies in developing abdominal muscles. Scale bar=50 \u00b5m. Figure 4. Myobast (red, arrowhead) fusing with a developing muscle fibre in WT when compared to that stripe expressing tendon- precursors and developing muscles interact through the EGF- signaling pathway. Explorations in the embryo and in the adult have suggested that hh and Wnt signaling, respectively, could have a role in the matching of specific muscle- tendon- interactions. We are examining identified signaling pathways in adult muscle- tendon interaction in Drosophila. We use stripe-Gal4 to perturb selected molecules in tendon cells. Perturbation of the Wnt signaling myotubes pathway in muscle attachment sites affects the migration of myotubes towards their attachment sites. inhibition of EGFr signaling in tendon cells using dominant negative receptor affects tendon cell projections. We have marked muscles and tendons with differential labels and, in this background, have started a large scale- screen of U aS-rnai lines (obtained from niG Japan) to identify molecules in the establishment of myo- tendonous junctions. We use MhC-Gal4 and stripe-Gal4 to express the rnai lines in muscle and tendon cells respectively. The approach is to look for the lethality and any other easily scorable phenotype first and then to examine their role in detail. We have picked up several interesting molecules, which show either lethality or flight defects, and these are being examined in detail. 7 The protein complex map of GuruharshaDifferences in complexity between organisms are not completely dependent on the number of genes in the genome but rather on how these genes interact in the cellular and organismal environment. Thus, understanding how gene products interact and indeed the rules that govern such interactions is an essential element in dissecting the cellular function of biological systems. Multi-protein complexes carry out most cellular processes. The identification and composition of such complexes is crucial for understanding how the ensemble of expressed proteins (the Proteome) is organized into functional units. Proteins interact with each other to build up networks that govern cellular functions. Defining these networks is an essential part of gaining a molecular understanding of how cellular behavior dictates the development and physiology of an organism. The goal of this project is to establish a complete protein interaction map of the Drosophila proteome based on the isolation and Mass spectrometric analysis of purified protein complexes associated with individually tagged proteins. The project involves a systematic retrieval and analysis of cellular protein complexes in sufficient quantities for biochemical analysis of their components. This will determine the first complete metazoan proteome map beyond the level of binary protein interactions. We are generating stable transgenic fly lines that can express tagged proteins in regulated manner to understand protein complexes in different cellular/ tissue contexts. The results we obtain from these studies will not only benefit the Drosophila community but will be of fundamental interest and practical use to a very broad spectrum of researchers.Collaborators: Spyros Artavanis-Tsakonas, Harvard Medical School, USA; Drosophila Genome Project, L.S.

We combine experiments and computer models to understand complex neural behavior starting from molecular interactions and culminating in behavior. Our laboratory is looking at two specific brain functions: the sense of smell, and memory. The sense of smell Three of the key features of an odorant are its intensity, identity, and location. Somehow the brain extracts many kinds of olfactory information from the complex, intermittent flux of chemicals that constitutes an odorant stimulus. We have used imaging, electrical recordings, and odor-guided behavior to analyze olfactory neural processing. We are developing computational models that build upon our experimental results and basic biophysical laws, to understand how the brain arrives at a complete picture of the olfactory world. Memory Memory is characterized by stability, robustness, and the ability to recall complete memories from minimal cues. it is a challenge to understand how such attributes arise from noisy, lossy, and diffusive chemistry at the junctions between brain cells. We have used electrical and optical recordings, and high-resolution microscopy, to map out some of these chemical circuits. We are working toward building a biologically detailed computational model of memory, from molecules to the network.Computational neuroscienceUPINDER S.

Clement and Ashesh DhawaleWe study how brain activity encodes three key dimensions of an odorant stimulus: intensity, identity and location. Using electrical recordings, we have measured rat olfactory bulb responses to odorant stimuli under a wide range of concentrations and in mixtures. We have identified a likely encoding scheme that accurately describes the firing patterns of 80% of recorded neurons to any combination and concentration of two odorants. This may account for intensity and identity encoding. We have also identified laterality in response properties that rapidly and accurately predicts the location of odorants. This may provide the third dimension, that of odor location, in the olfactory bulb. To go from single-unit to network-level encoding, we have built an in-vivo 2-photon system for optically recording from many cells simultaneously. b. Behavior Raghav Rajan, Urvashi Raheja and K. Parthasarathyrats are excellent at tracking odors, such as food, to their source. By studying rats trained to push sensors depending on odor direction, we have shown that rats can locate odors using stereo cues. They compare the intensity and time of arrival in each nostril, to determine the location of the odor source. They can identify multiple odors and respond in a different way to each. We find that rats can do this in under 200 msec, comparable to the reaction time of a trained athlete. Do they use this ability in nature? We have trained rats to navigate toward an odor source in a laminar air-flow arena to test the contribution of stereo and rapid odor processing in natural odor-location strategies. c. Models Subhasis Ray, Niraj Dudani, Rinaldo D'Souza and U.S. BhallaThe cellular and network physiology of the olfactory bulb is among the best characterized in the brain. With this data we propose that we can predict the emergence of representations of odor identity, intensity, and location from the first principles of cellular biophysics. We are building one of the largest-ever simulations of any brain structure, where we plan to model the entire olfactory bulb with particular attention to biophysical detail. This model will be calibrated against our own and other data, and will run on our 260-node supercomputer. 2 Memory a. PhysiologySriram M. Ajay and Dhanya Parameshwaranhow do memory-triggered signals spread through the neuron? We have used electrical recordings and immunohistochemistry in the hippocampal slice to map out the extent and mechanisms of this spread. We examined a series of possible models by comparing computer predictions with experiments, to show that both synaptic and voltage-gated calcium influx contributes to the activity spread. We are also approaching the issue of spatial extent of memory signals from the network perspective, using optical recordings and multiple stimulus points to read out many synaptic responses in parallel. b Models Pragati Jain, Arnold Hayer, Priyamvada Rajasethupathy and U.S. BhallaComplex chemical circuits mediate the subcellular steps that give rise to memory. One mechanism for this is when chemical circuits act like memory switches, which can stably persist in either of two states (on or off). While computationally analyzing the movement of molecules in the synapse, we unexpectedly discovered that such a switch emerged from the regulated movement of neurotransmitter receptors. We showed that this switch could retain its state for over a year despite molecular noise, diffusion and turnover. We are modeling the synaptic activity-dependent control of protein synthesis through Figure 1. Image of neurons from hippocampus taken with custom-built 2-photon microscope Figure 2.

Finally, in a collaboration with naren ramakrishnan at Virginia Tech, we are systematically exploring chemical space to find such bistable switches. 3 Computational brain is too complex to understand unaided. We have developed an extensive set of tools and on-line resources to model the brain. The Database of Quantitative Cellular Signaling (DOQCS) was one of the first databases of the chemical systems in the brain, and we have enhanced its capabilities to include multiple file formats (Matlab and SBML) as well as improved searches. The DOQCS database is now twinned with the BioModels database at EB i. We are also developing a way to generally specify experiments and their outcomes, to drive models in a database and test how accurate their results are. b. Simulation software Subhasis Ray, Niraj Dudani and U.S. BhallaThe challenging goal of modeling brain function requires the use of powerful computers, and new kinds of software that can model at many levels of detail and do so transparently from laptops to supercomputers. The Messaging Object Oriented Simulation Environment, MOOSE, is a new simulator that supports this. MOOSE is backward compatible with the old GEn ESiS simulator, but is a complete redesign with much greater power and usability. MOOSE is designed to easily plug in optimized numerical engines to perform very fast computations, while retaining transparent parallelization. MOOSE works with modern scripting languages like Python and handles standard XML-based data formats for model specification.Collaborators: Z.

Memories come in many different flavors, some more potent than others. Unconscious emotional memories of fearful experiences, formed in a brain structure called the amygdala, appear to leave an indelible mark that may last for a lifetime. The rapid and efficient encoding of fear memories by the amygdala help us cope with threatening stimuli in the future, but it also comes with a high price tag. These emotional memories etched into the amygdalar circuitry can also become maladaptive. For example, high anxiety and mood lability are cardinal symptoms of many stress disorders. What are the cellular mechanisms underlying these powerful emotional symptoms? We are addressing this question using a range of behavioral, morphometric, in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological tools. We find that chronic stress causes excitatory neurons of the amygdala to have larger dendritic arbors with more synaptic contacts on them. These newly formed synapses are endowed with a greater proportion of a receptor molecule that mediates emotional memory formation in the amygdala. Under normal conditions, these excitatory neurons are kept in check by synaptic inhibition. But, whenever stress enhances anxiety, it also lowers inhibitory tone in the amygdala. interestingly, drugs that help protect against stress, also prevent many of these synaptic changes. Thus, our findings suggest that stress creates an ideal synaptic substrate in the amygdala for imprinting powerful fear memories, which become a source of persistent and intense anxiety. in addition to behavioral experience, the genes we inherit can also cause cognitive and emotional dysfunction. hence, we are extending our analyses to genetically engineered mice to identify molecular targets that may help correct symptoms of Fragile X Syndrome, the leading genetic cause of autism.Plasticity in the amygdala: implications for stress disorders and mental SUMANTRA McEwen and Molecular Neurobiology: Behavioral Neurochemistry S. and Bear, M.F.

Chronic stress strengthens the structural and physiological basis of synaptic connectivity in the lateral amygdala by enhancing dendritic arbors (left), spine density (center), and currents mediated by nMD a receptors (right) in projection neurons.Selected publications 800 600 400 200 0 -200 -400 pA 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.0 s \u0014\u0010\u0010\u0000P!\u0000\u0010\u000e\u0011\u0000S\u0000 NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 90 7/10/08 5:34:32 PM91 SUM anT ra C ha TTarJ i1 Impact of chronic stress on excitatory pyramidal neurons in the lateral amygdala (La), we are examining the electrophysiological properties of spines formed by chronic immobilization stress (CiS, 2h/day for 10 days). We find that stress amplifies the ratio of nMD a to aMPa receptor mediated excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs). Further, the ratio of coefficient of variation (CV) is smaller in stress-treated cells when the CV of evoked aMPa and nMD a EPSCs is compared in the same cell. This decrease in CV ratio in stressed neurons is only due to a decrease in the CV of nMD a-EPSC, reflecting a larger number of nMD a receptor synapses contributing to the EPSC. analysis of mixed miniature EPSCs with aMPa and nMD a components also suggests that the increase in evoked nMD a currents is due to addition of nMD a receptors to newly formed spines that do not contain aMPars. Thus, chronic stress appears to create nMD a-only or \"silent synapses\" in the La, which in turn could enhance their capacity for subsequent potentiation. indeed, nMD a receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP), a synaptic plasticity mechanism for learning and memory, is amplified after chronic stress. We are now studying the molecular mechanisms underlying these cellular changes. 2 Stress-induced modulation of fear memory and its in vivo encoding in single neurons Supriya Ghosh and Anupratap TomarStress induced formation of silent synapses and enhancement of LTP is expected to amplify the functional output of the La. We use Pavlovian auditory fear conditioning to examine the extent to which stress modulates learning and memory of emotional events. The same pairing of auditory tones with weak footshock that only elicits moderate levels of freezing in unstressed rats causes significantly greater freezing in previously stressed rats (Figure 1a). hence, stress-induced generation of silent synapses may shift amygdalar cells to a state where their capacity for subsequent potentiation is enhanced, thereby creating an ideal synaptic substrate for affective disorders. These studies, however, are limited by the fact that function is inferred from analysis at the cellular and behavioral levels without any online readout of dynamic changes in neuronal activity in the intact animal. To bridge this gap, we are recording extracellular action potential firing simultaneously from multiple La neurons in awake, behaving rats. Such single-unit recordings from La neurons show robust increases in tone responses after fear conditioning (Figure 1b), thereby enabling us to monitor how neural encoding of fear memories in the amygdala is modulated during and after stressful experiences of varying duration and intensity. These in vivo multi-electrode recordings are being extended to study the impact of stress on \"place cells\" in the hippocampus. Figure 1. (a) Stress enhances consolidation of memory formed after auditory fear conditioning. (b) Fear conditioning induces increase in tone-evoked spike firing in lateral amygdala neurons, monitored using multi-channel single-unit recording system episode of stress on synaptic inhibition Aparna SuvrathanWhile the above results suggest a role for stress-induced modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission in enhancing fear, inhibitory synaptic transmission also regulates functional output of the amygdala. hence, we are analyzing the relationship between stress, anxiety and synaptic inhibition in the La. The same chronic stress that enhances anxiety causes a reduction in G aBaergic inhibitory currents in La principal neurons. Strikingly, this inverse relation between anxiety and synaptic inhibition emerges even when animals are exposed to a single 2-hour episode of stress. although this brief stress has no significant effect on anxiety a day later, it leads to higher anxiety 10 days later. Strikingly, there is a significant reduction in the mean amplitude and frequency of miniature G aBaergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mi PSCs) in La principal neurons only 10 days, but not a day, after acute stress. Thus, gradual suppression of synaptic inhibition in the La parallels the slow build-up of anxiety even after a brief stressor. 4 From animal models to therapeutic strategies results on the delayed effects of acute stress have led to animal models that capture various aspects of emotional disorders, such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), in humans. Treatment with the anxiolytic diazepam before acute stress prevents reduction in synaptic inhibition, spinogenesis, and enhanced anxiety 10 days after acute stress. Strikingly, diazepam given after acute stress also reverses the decrease in synaptic inhibition 10 days later. Further, corticosterone treatment preceding acute stress blocks the eventual increase in anxiety and La spine-density. Conversely, in adrenalectomized animals acute stress leads to even greater anxiety, which can be attenuated with corticosterone treatment. These animal studies are consistent with clinical reports showing that cortisol treatment reduces the cardinal symptoms of PTSD. Since stress and emotional trauma have been implicated in depressive disorders, we are also analyzing the synaptic and behavioral effects of antidepressants, such as fluoxetine and tianeptine, on the amygdala. 5 Negative versus positive experiences Ruchi MalikEnvironmental enrichment (EE) - consisting of increased exercise, social interactions and exposure to objects that encourage exploration - is known to have beneficial effects in the cortex and hippocampus of the rodent brain, e.g. enhanced dendritic arbors, spine density, LTP , and learning. Paradoxically, we observed the same effects in the amygdala, not as a result of a positive experience like EE, but after an aversive experience like chronic stress. This raises an intriguing question - how would the amygdala respond to EE? if EE elicits cellular changes in the amygdala similar to the hippocampus, then our earlier results predict EE to enhance anxiety and fear learning. But one expects positive experiences to reduce fear and anxiety. On the other hand, if EE does reduce fear and anxiety, would it induce cellular changes in the amygdala that are different from the hippocampus? indeed, we find that EE decreases amygdala-dependent auditory fear conditioning, as well as anxiety. But, EE does not enhance spine density in the La. in contrast, the same EE enhances hippocampal spine density and contextual fear conditioning. Thus, plasticity elicited by a positive experience also appear to be different in the amygdala. 6 Reversal of symptoms of Fragile X Syndrome Aparna Suvrathan and Sonal KediaFragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most commonly inherited form of mental retardation and the leading genetic cause of autism, is caused by transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene. although moderate to severe cognitive impairment is a key feature of FXS, patients also display severe problems related to anxiety, attention deficit, and hyperactivity. The Fmr1-knockout (KO) mouse is a powerful animal model for investigating symptoms of human FXS. We have examined two NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 92 7/10/08 5:34:32 PM93 molecular targets that hold promise in developing new treatments for FXS. in one study, we were able to rescue a range of cellular and behavioral abnormalities observed in Fmr1-KO mice by employing a genetic strategy to inhibit activity of p21-activated kinase (P aK), which is critical for regulating the structure of dendritic spines. higher spine-density, a morphological defect observed in FXS, is reversed by genetic inhibition of P aK in Fmr1-KO mice (Figure 2). This is accompanied by a full recovery of normal LTP . at the behavioral level, reduced P aK activity attenuates abnormalities in locomotor activity, stereotypy, anxiety, and trace fear-conditioning. in another study, using Fmr1-KO mice with a 50% reduction in metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGlur5) expression, we find that elevated spine density is also reversed in the cortex and amygdala. Taken together, these findings have significant therapeutic implications for FXS and related autism spectrum disorders.Collaborators: Susumu Tonegawa and Mark Bear, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA and B.S. Shankaranarayana Rao, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore 7 A novel form of LTP induced by chemical activation of mGluRs in the amygdala Aparna Suvrathan, Ruchi Malik and Sonal KediaOur data on the reversal of enhanced spine density in Fmr1-KO mice by reducing mGlur5 expression is particularly significant in light of the \"mGlur theory\", which proposes that various aspects of FXS are a consequence of exaggerated mGlur function. Most findings that have contributed to the mGlur theory are based on studies in the hippocampus and cortex. however, the emotional or mood-related symptoms of FXS are likely to involve the amygdala, which remains unexplored in the context of the mGlur theory and FXS. intriguingly, two key symptoms of FXS - enhanced anxiety and spine-density - are also observed in the amygdala after stress. The stress response is also abnormally high in FXS individuals and Fmr1-KO mice. But, mGlur5-mediated plasticity in the hippocampus leads to weakening and elimination of synapses, not LTP and spine formation. This in turn would predict that if LTP is a necessary step for enhancing La spine-density and anxiety, then mGlur activation in the La should lead to synaptic strenghtening, not weakening. Confirming this prediction, brief bath application of a selective mGlur -agonist induces LTP in the La. in addition to its obvious implications for FXS, this novel form of LTP adds to growing evidence on contrasting forms of plasticity (a) in cortical pyramidal cells in Fmr1- KO mice, which can be reversed by genetic inhibition of P aK activity (b). SUM anT ra C ha TTarJ i NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 93 7/10/08 5:34:33 PMSelected publications The lab is in engaged in understanding the regulation of axonal transport of cargoes that are targeted to synapses. axonal transport carries a variety of cargoes from the cell body to the synapse and from the synapse to the cell body, known respectively as anterograde and retrograde transport. Transport along the axonal highway takes place using molecular motors that move on microtubule tracks by hydrolyzing aTP . Most kinesin family motors move to the plus-end of microtubules and thus carry cargo to the synapse while dynein motors carry cargo to the minus-end of microtubules and thus away from the synapse. Transport in neurons is an essential process. This has been demonstrated, for instance, by progressive motor neuropathies such as human CMT2A observed in patients carrying mutations in motor protein genes. neuronal transport is very complex and its regulation is poorly understood. To gain further insights, we study axonal transport of certain cargoes carried by Kinesin-3/UNC-104 and Kinesin-i/U nC-116, two well-characterized kinesin motor to transport synaptic vesicle proteins. Kinesin-i/U nC-116 is known to transport mitochondria and to influence transport of synaptic vesicle proteins. Presence of both these cargoes at synapses is very important for neuronal function. We visualize synaptic vesicles using synaptic vesicle proteins fused to GFP and mitochondria using a matrix targeted GFP . These markers report the localization of both synaptic vesicles and mitochondria not only at synapses but also along the axon. We broadly address the following questions: (1) Cargo recognition by the UnC-104 motor, (2) regulation of mitochondrial and synaptic vesicle transport by Kinesin-i and its cargo adaptors. We address these questions using a combination of genetic, live imaging and molecular techniques using the C. elegans model.Regulation of along the axon: the complex roles of J iPs in transport. BioEssays (in press). image of worm showing fluorescent mitochondria neurons Jitendra Kumar UnC-104 is a major synaptic vesicle motor in multiple model systems. This protein binds vesicles through its Ph-domain. The lipid binding Ph domain of U nC-104 has been shown to be essential for function. Further, an orthologous Ph-domain with the same in vitro lipid binding specificity does not fully restore U nC-104 function in vivo, suggesting a role for other proteins. We therefore began studying how the U nC-104 Ph domain recognizes cargo. We identified an unc-104 allele, (e1265) which has a single point mutation D1497N in the Ph domain that severely affects the locomotion of the mutant animals. To determine how a single amino acid change could dramatically alter function, we built a structural model of the U nC-104 Ph domain. On docking the reported substrate Pi P 2 onto this model, we observed that the highest probability of binding the lipid was in the region juxtaposed to D1497 (Figure 1). To further understand the role of this lesion we isolated intragenic suppressors of e1265 and sequenced the alleles obtained. We identified two intragenic suppressors within the Ph domain that restored locomotion to the e1265 allele. These intragenic suppressors have two compensatory changes in the Ph domain, namely either an M1540i lesion or an R1501Q lesion. The M1540i lesion was independently isolated multiple times. This residue acts at a distance of over 20\u00c5 and could mediate suppression effects through intermediate residues. The R1501Q is present in the same loop as D1497n and probably mediates its suppression effects locally. These suppressors also largely restore transport in the shorter motor neurons as seen by recovery of synaptic vesicle markers in synapses. however in D1497n M1540I or D1497n R1501Q alleles only restore transport. Live imaging of GFP::raB-3, a synaptic vesicle cargo marker, shows that anterograde flux in mechanosensory neurons is significantly reduced in unc-104(e1265) animals and is partially restored in the intragenic suppressor alleles (Figure 2). reports in literature suggest that cargo binding may influence the velocity profile of U nC-104. We are about to test whether the D1497n lesion and the other suppressor alleles affect the in vivo motility properties of the U nC-104 motor. in summary we have identified a new amino acid that we think influences U nC-104 Ph domain function by modulating its ability to bind cargo. We are also interested in other molecules that act along with U nC-104 to enable cargo recognition. That other proteins play roles in the ability of the Ph domain to bind cargo has been demonstrated by in vitro biochemistry showing reduced binding of the U nC-104 Ph domain to vesicles devoid of proteins. We have taken a genetic approach to identify such molecules by isolating extragenic suppressors of the e1265 allele. Characterization thus far has demonstrated that each such suppressor acts in neurons to partially restore transport. We are further characterizing these extragenic suppressors for allele-specificity by testing whether they restore locomotion to an unc-104 allele with a motor domain mutation or restore viability to an unc-104 null allele.

The Kinesin-i motor is a heteroteramer that consists of two heavy chains (KhC) and two light chains (KLC). The heavy chains bind microtubules and hydrolyze aTP while the light chains enable binding to certain cargoes. The role of Kinesin-i in synaptic vesicle transport requires a multi-protein adaptor complex found associated with the Kinesin-i motor (Figure 3). The main adaptor that links the Kinesin-i motor to its cargo is J iP3, a c-JU n kinase interacting protein. Members of the J iP family are J nK cascade kinase scaffolding proteins. They function as Kinesin-i cargo adapters and play complex roles in transport. For instance unc-16, the J iP3 orthologue in C. elegans, has been shown to function in an unc-104 bypass pathway. in unc-104; unc-16 double mutants certain synaptic vesicle proteins are able to exit the cell body and weakly suppress the locomotor defects of unc-104 mutants. it has been proposed that these effects are mediated by binding vesicular cargoes to alternate motors. Our current data suggest that in unc-16 mutants there is a significant reduction in the average anterograde velocity of GFP::raB-3 marked vesicles with only small effects on retrograde transport. The observed change in velocity profiles supports the hypothesis that certain synaptic vesicle proteins are transported by alternate motors only in the anterograde pathway. We are also assessing whether the unc-16 bypass pathway acts on all or a subset of synaptic vesicle proteins. We are also examining the role of other known members of the Kinesin-i adaptor complex (e.g. UNC-14) in the unc-104 bypass pathway. 3 Regulation of mitochondrial transport by Kinesin-I and its adaptor complex Guruprasad Reddy, Swathi Reddy and S. MohanThe Kinesin-i motor is known to transport mitochondria in other model systems. We tested whether the Kinesin-i motor and other associated molecules known to transport vesicular cargoes influence mitochondrial transport (Figure 3). as expected the lack of Kinesin-i motor greatly reduced the number of mitochondria in axons. Members of the complex such as unc-14 and unc-51 also reduced number of mitochondria in axons. Surprisingly, we found that lack of the vesicular adaptor UNC-16/ JiP3 dramatically increases the number of mitochondria (Figure 4). in unc-16, Kinesin-i motor double mutant animals the number of mitochondria in axons remains high. Thus we see that UNC-16/J iP3 has roles independent of the Kinesin-i motor in regulating numbers of mitochondria in axons (Figure 4). On live imaging of transport in unc-16 animals we observed a decrease in average retrograde velocity but no effect on anterograde velocity. Thus the effects of unc-16 on regulating mitochondrial numbers in axons may occur through retrograde transport in a Kinesin-i motor independent pathway. For at least one other member of the Kinesin-i adaptor complex we did not find such Kinesin-i motor independent roles. The unc-51 adaptor Kinesin-i motor double mutants did not show any change in mitochondrial numbers in axons when compared with Kinesin-i motor mutants alone. Some Kinesin-i motor independent effects of unc-16 could occur through J nK stress signaling pathways. Therefore we are testing the possible role of J nK cascade kinases in altering mitochondrial numbers in axons. Figure 3.

Serotonin (5-hT), a major neurotransmitter has been reported to affect early development in both invertebrates and vertebrates, though this is not much appreciated. We have spent the last few years trying to understand the role of a specific serotonin receptor subtype i.e. the 5-hT 2a receptor and its interaction with agonists, partial agonists and antagonists. in addition, we have been looking at serotonin and the role of this receptor in embryos and in stem cell populations. We have explored the interactions of dopamine, which acts as a partial agonist on the rat and human 5-hT2a receptors. The interactions of dopamine on the 5-hT2a receptor seem to be different from full agonists, such as serotonin, and antagonists, namely antipsychotics. We have identified conditions where dopamine activates the receptor at concentrations that are also known to be physiological. This adds another dimension both to our understanding of the role of this receptor as well as the role played by dopamine in psychiatric disorders. We have also extended our studies to look at the role of 5-hT and 5-hT 2a receptors in processes not often related directly to neural function and identified the presence of serotonin in pre- implantation mammalian embryos. Serotonin is distributed in a punctate manner within early embryos and is localized to the mitochondria. addition of 5-hT to embryos alters the mitochondrial potential which has an important role to play in embryonic development. Similarly, a lack of serotonin has been reported to effect mouse embryonic development. in our analysis of the receptor we observe functional 5-hT 2a receptors in embryonic stem cells as well as in neural stem cells. These receptors when blocked affect differentiation and seem to play a role in cell-substrate interactions, an aspect not previously studied. Our studies suggest newer roles for serotonin and its receptors and in areas previously unexplored.Bhattacharyya, S., Raote, I., Bhattacharya, A.

Serotoninergic and dopaminergic interactions are well known and are particularly important in the study of psychosis. antipsychotics and antidepressants largely target the receptors or the ligand of these two systems. The partial activation of the 5-hT 2a receptor by dopamine has been known for some time but the mechanism and its physiological relevance has not been understood. We have now established that though dopamine and serotonin activate the 5-hT 2a receptor the intracellular pathways associated with the activation are overlapping but different. in addition, we have identified conditions where these interactions would be physiologically relevant. We have discovered that if concentrations of serotonin sub-threshold for the internalization of the 5-hT 2a receptor are applied, the receptor becomes 10-fold more sensitive to dopamine. We have termed this 'priming' and this effect is maintained only transiently. The temporal order in which the ligands are applied is also critical and suggests a condition in which these two neurotransmitters may function like an anD gate. These results should help in understanding the role of these ligands and the 5-hT 2a receptor in behavior and also generate fresh clinical approaches in treating psychiatric disorders. More recently, in collaboration with Dr. Subeer Majumdar, nii, new Delhi, we have made transgenic mice that express the rat 5-hT 2a -EGFP receptor which will be used to study the receptor both in the brain as well as in other tissues.Collaborator: Sabeer Majumdar, National Institute of Immunology, Delhi 2 Examining the differences between human and rat 5-HT2A receptor subtypes Aditi Bhattacharya and Shobhana ShankarMost studies on the 5-hT 2a receptor have used the rat receptor as a model to study ligand interactions, drug binding as well as the second messenger pathways activated by the receptor. Our initial studies have also focused on the rat homolog. More recently, we have begun work on the human homolog and observed that there are subtle but perhaps critical differences in its interaction with agonists, partial agonists and antagonists. Since this may have important implications in clinical approaches we have examined the human homolog in greater detail. We have observed that the human receptor exhibits increased sensitivity to serotonin and also seems to have an increased repertoire of intracellular pathways. its sensitivity to dopamine is also higher. Site-specific mutagenesis studies have helped to identify key residues that are involved in these interactions. in addition, we have been working with a naturally occurring variant of this receptor that occurs with high frequency the human population. We have noticed that there are differences in the manner in which this variant receptor interacts with ligands and this could lead us to control receptor effects and activity better.Figure 1. Time series of dopamine-mediated internalization of rat 5-HT2A receptor in HEK293 cells Figure 2. Time series of serotonin-mediated internalization of and Rupam Chowdhury Serotonin and its receptors have been known to play an important role in neural systems. its role in non-neural development and function outside the nervous system are not as widely appreciated. not surprisingly, the role of 5-hT 2a receptors in areas outside the nervous system has also not been extensively studied. We had in the last few years noticed that overexpression of the 5-hT2a receptor seems to affect cell-substrate adhesion in hEK 293 cells. The adhesion seems to be decreased by receptor-specific antagonists and adhesion is increased on application of serotonin. We have now determined that cytoskeletal changes that accompany changes in adhesion can be regulated by serotonin through the 5-hT 2a receptor and that the major second messenger pathway, which is associated with protein kinase C, does not play a role in the maintenance of adhesion. Similar roles seem to be played by the 5-hT 2a receptor in neural stem adhesion and embryonic stem cell differentiation in in vitro experiments. We have identified a number of genes that are downregulated on inhibiting the 5-hT2a receptor in in vitro studies. Extending these studies to in vivo models, we find that the same genes are downregulated in the brain on exposure to an antagonist of the receptor. These studies indicate that antagonists to the 5-hT 2a receptor may bring about changes in a new and unexpected manner and changes in the adhesion properties may play a part in the changes brought about by such ligands.Collaborator: Sanjeev Galande, National Centre for Cell Science, Pune 4 Characterization and differentiation of cells serve both as valuable models systems for developmental biology as well as substrates for cell replacement therapies. We have been looking at the differentiation of embryonic stem cells towards neural lineages. a report on the presence of serotonin, a neurotransmitter in mouse embryonic stem cells, led us to look for serotonin in human embryonic stem cells and also its receptors. We find that serotonin is present and distributed in a punctate pattern in both human and embryonic stem cells and both isoforms of tryptophan hydroxylase are present, indicating that serotonin is synthesized in ES cells. in addition, we find that a few of the serotonin receptor subtypes are also expressed in mammalian ES cells. We have established that one of the receptor subtypes, i.e. 5-hT 2a, is functional and blocking this receptor affects the differentiation of ES cells. We are presently exploring the mechanism by which serotonin and its receptors affect ES cell growth and differentiation. 5 Role of serotonin in pre-implantation embryos Basudha BasuThe presence of serotonin in mammalian ES cells led us to look for its presence in earlier stages in development, namely pre-implantation embryos. Pre-implantation mouse embryos were examined at various stages for serotonin using immunocytochemistry as well as multi-photon microscopy. The latter technique allows us to visualize 5-hT in live embryos. We find that serotonin is present in early embryos including oocytes and that it is distributed in punctate structures. in pre-implantation embryos, both TPh2, the neural isoform of tryptophan hydroxylase and the serotonin transporter are present. in addition, we find that serotonin is localized to mitochondria in embryos and can increase mitochondrial potential. Lack of serotonin and changes in mitochondrial potential have both been known to disrupt embryonic development. We are now determining the mechanism by which serotonin affects mitochondrial potential.Collaborators: Sudipta NCBS Figure 3.

In collaboration with researchers fm NIMHANS, Bangalore, we have transplanted these cells into the brains of ventral subicular-lesioned rats, which have specific spatial memory deficits and examined functional recovery. Our results indicate that the rats recover from their deficit substantially and the transplanted cells also migrate into specific areas of the lesioned brain. Further studies are underway to determine the mechanisms of recovery and cell migration.Collaborators: Bindu Kutty and T.R.

SANE sane@ncbs.res.in The spectacular evolutionary success of insects owes much to the evolution of flight. Insect flight is characterized by speed, control and manoeuvrability. Their wings flap at very rapid rates (typically on the order of 10-100 Hz) and hence their sensory system must acquire and process information at similar rates. How do the nervous systems of insects tackle the extraordinary challenges of acquiring, integrating and processing sensory information and generating rapid behavioral responses to ensure stable flight? A rigorous study of this question requires multi-disciplinary research in the areas of physics, biomechanics, neurobiology and behavior. Our work combines the input from these various sub-disciplines to address diverse flight-related phenomena. Sane, S. P . ( 2003). The aerodynamics of insect flight.

To address this question, we built a dynamically scaled robotic flapper (affectionately called Robofly) to study the basic fluid dynamical principles that make flapping flight of insects fundamentally distinct from fixed-wing flight of airplanes. From these studies, we were able to show that the high lift generated by flapping wings can be sustained over the entire duration of the wing stroke, unlike their fixed wing counterpart which tends to stall. This study resulted in a semi-empirical model that could predict the instantaneous forces generated by a flapping wing performing any arbitrary kinematic pattern. Currently, we are extending these techniques to study the effect of wing flexibility on aerodynamic force generation. With increase in size of the insect, their wings tend to show greater flexibility with direct consequences to their ability to generate aerodynamic forces. This study will also extend into the biomaterial aspects of wing flexibility to address how wing flexibility may influence longevity of the wing structure through the typical lifetime of an animal. In addition, we are also studying the gross flows around insect bodies during flight and trying to understand how these flows influence various aspects of insect physiology such as thermoregulation, odor detection etc. Apart from the obvious biological implications of these studies, these results will also help in development of optimally performing wings for micromechanical robotic insects. These aspects are being studied in close collaboration with roboticists and engineers, at the University of Delaware. 2 The neural basis of flight behavior On the neurobiological front, how do flying insects use various sensors distributed over their body to acquire information about their environment and how is this information used in stabilizing their flight? We have recently begun investigating this question with specific focus on the role of antennae in acquisition and processing of self-generated and externally-generated sensory cues that mediate flight control in hawk moths. Our behavioral studies revealed that antennae play a very crucial role in mediating flight control: insects lacking the distal segment of their antennae (i.e. flagella) are unable to fly in a coordinated manner. However, when the flagellar integrity is restored, their flight ability can be rescued. Our electrophysiological studies show that individual mechanosensory neurons at the base of the antennae are tuned to vibratory motion of the antennae and capable of transducing cues essential for flight control. Visualization of the underlying neural circuitry reveals that a bulk of the antennal mechanosensory information is relayed to an area of the brain called the AMMC (Antennal Motor and Mechanosensory Centre), before it is transmitted to the flight motor units. Thus, antennal mechanosensors are involved in mediating flight control in insects. Our studies will endeavour to throw light on the evolution of antennal diversity among insects in relation to their flight mechanics, as well as the specific roles of the antenna and the AMMC in flight control. Ongoing research from my laboratory also addresses flight under natural circumstances. We will study how the antennal mechanosensory modality combines with visual inputs to enable flight in moths and butterflies. We are keen to diversify this study into the area of flight energetics, thermoregulation and behavioral ecology of )NTRINSIC\u0000!NTENNAL\u0000-USCLES\u0000\"OHM\u00b4S\u0000\"RISTLES\u0000*OHNSTON\u00b4S\u0000/RGAN\u0000!NTENNAL\u0000.ERVE\u0000 !NTENNAL\u0000.ERVE\u0000Figure 2. SIDDIQI Olfactory behavior in Drosophila is partly inborn and partly acquired. Our group is studying ontogeny of olfactory behavior and odor learning ability in the fly. The report by Sarit Pati Goswami et al. shows that newly born larvae are attracted by low concentration of ethyl acetate within minutes of eclosion irrespective of the odor environment, but sensitivity to odorants increases with age. Aversion to high concentration takes several hours to develop. In the previous report, we had shown that the multiphasic learning retention curves, in the third instar larvae can be decomposed by a simple graphic procedure into three distinct phases; short term memory (STM), middle term memory (MTM) and long term memory (LTM). We now show that these phases correspond to exactly STM, MTM and LTM as revealed by study of learning mutants and effect of anesthetics and other memory ablating treatments. Tuhin Subhra Chakraborty et al. describe changes in the sensitivity of chemoreceptors that accompany imaginal conditioning. They find that odor imprinting increases the affinity of the chemoreceptor to several different ligands, all acting on the same receptor but as Jawaid Ahsan shows, there is no indication of transcriptional regulation. The first effect of odor imprinting is thus, an enhancement of peripheral sensitivity. Type III sensillae contain two receptors Or22a and Or85b. The A neuron projects to the glomerulus DM2. Recordings from the sensillum permit us to study the effect of conditioning on the olfactory pathway described in this report. Odorosiddiqi@ncbs.res.in Selected publications Chakraborty, T.S., Prabhakar, S., Kumar, S. and of imaginal conditioning in S.P ., and Siddiqi, O. (2007). Increased sensitivity of olfactory receptor neurons correlate to imaginal conditioning in Drosophila undergo distinctive changes after eclosion. When the flies are exposed to certain odorants, attraction towards these chemicals increase. This phenomenon called 'Imaginal conditioning' has been described in these reports. We are now studying the development of olfactory behavior in the larva. Larval response can be analyzed by tracking individual larvae in an odor gradient. Single larvae are placed at the centre of a petri dish and their movement towards an odor source is tracked videographically (Figure 1c). Analysis of these tracks provides information about several features of the response. Freshly eclosed larvae have an inborn attraction towards ethyl acetate (EA) (Figure 1a). Their movements are however, disoriented and wayward and sensitivity to the odorant is low. With age, the ability to orient towards the odor source improves and sensitivity increases (Figure 2a). Newly born larvae, cultured on cornmeal or a synthetic medium with or without EA, show the same attractive or aversive orientation to the odor source. 20 hour old larvae, exposed to 10 -4 dilution of EA however, tend to move away from concentrations of the odorant higher than 10-4 (Figure 2c). 2 Olfactory memory in the larvae of of aversive conditioning in Drosophila larvae. The learning retention curves obtained from repetitive electroshock training are polyphasic and can be analyzed by a simple graphic procedure, originally due to Scatchard, into three monophasic component each decaying exponentially at a fixed rate. The three component of memory curve, short term (STM), middle term (MTM) and long term (LTM) display distinct properties in kinetics of their formation and decline (Abu Baker et al, NCBS report 2005). One might ask whether the dissociation of polyphasic memory curve into distinct components STM, MTM and LTM is merely an algebraic manipulation or reveals something real about memory. We present evidence that STM, MTM and LTM obtained by our analysis correspond exactly to components of larval memory determined by independent experiments. OBAID SIDDIqIFigure 1. Movement of newly eclosed larvae towards 10-3 EA. Larva starts at S, the centre of the plate; E is the end of the track. The displacement vector SE represents individual responses. The odor source is placed along the x-axis. The average displacement 1/N (D x) towards the source is a measure of attraction. The divergence angle, , between the displacement vector and abscissa 1/N (), provides a measure of avoidance. (N=20) Figure 2. Development of attraction and aversion. Larvae were cultured on complete media (2a). Newly born larvae are less responsive to the odorant (EA) compared to 20 hr old larvae. Larvae are cultured on a synthetic medium (2b and 2c). Larvae conditioned with 10 -4 EA (CR) and unconditioned larvae (UCR) show attraction at birth (2b), but develop an avoidance response at concentrations higher than 10 -4 when 20 hr old (2c). dxE (degrees) Divergence (degrees)1.1 1.0 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.0 -6 -5 -5020406080100 encodes pituitary adenylate cyclase is required for anesthesia sensitive intermediate term memory (Waddell et. al., 2000). The last mentioned mutant radish, is deficient in anesthesia resistant memory (Folkers et al., 1993). The analysis of learning retention curve in the four mutants shows the expected deficit in phases of memory revealed by Scatchard analysis (Figure 3). The advantage of this method of analysis lies in the fact that it allows us to follow the kinetics of memory formation and decay in the three phases separately. The memory curve can also be dissected by treatment with anesthetics or other agents, which block neural activity. Cooling eliminates anesthesia sensitive STM and MTM while depolarization with KCl blocks STM alone. Inhibitors of transcription and translation, novobiocin and cycloheximide respectively blocks LTM without affecting STM and MTM. Treatments with blockers in combination with Scatchard analysis provides us with a convenient method for a quantitative analysis of memory. These experiments also show that STM, MTM and LTM are not sequentially or serially related. 3 Effect of odor imprinting acetate (EA), Iso-amyl acetate (IAA) or Hexanol greatly increases attraction towards these chemicals. We have previously reported that attractive conditioning in the imago is accompanied with an increase in the amplitude of electroantennogram (EAG). We describe here, the effect of imaginal conditioning on responses of sensory neurons in sensilla basiconica. W.G. Thorpe (1937) first discovered that exposure of Drosophila larvae to Menthol alters the olfactory behavior of He named the phenomenon 'larval-imaginal' or 'pre-imaginal conditioning'. Subsequent investigators tended to interpret Thorpe's observation as habituation. Experiments in Figure 3.

It is unlikely to be simple habituation or desensitization. We examined the effect of odor conditioning on three selected Basiconic sensilla. The type I sensillum has four neurons A, B, C and D and the type II and III contain two neurons each. Action potentials from these neurons can be analyzed by extracellular recordings with capillary electrodes (Figure 4) and dose response curves in conditioned and unconditioned flies, can be compared. Figure 5 shows the responses of 4-day old flies grown under three different conditions; i) both larva and imago cultured on an odorless medium; ii) larva on cornmeal and imago on odor-free medium and iii) both stages on synthetic medium containing 10 -4 dilution of EA. Odor experience at both stages alters the response to five different acetate esters. The dose-response curves are shown in Figure 6. It may be seen that conditioning alters the Km of the response without affecting the maximal response. The underlying mechanism remains to be understood. 4 Effect of olfactory conditioning on transcription of odorant receptors Jawaid AhsanExposure to Ethyl acetate (EA) causes an increased attraction in conditioned flies to this odor and a correlated enhancement in the electrophysiological response of olfactory receptor neurons (See Rashid et al, NCBS Report 2005 and Chakraborty et al, this report). The adult flies (0 to 12 hours old) were conditioned by exposing them to 10 -4 Ethyl acetate in an odor free medium for four days in a 12/12 hours day night cycle. The flies were then tested for 10-5 Ethyl acetate in the T maze behavioral assay. The conditioned response was 0.80 and the unconditioned response 0.25 In order to see whether olfactory conditioning involves transcriptional regulation, I have carried out a quantitative Real Time RT-PCR analysis of two receptors Or83b, a non-canonical odorant receptor present in 70% of olfactory receptor neurons, synthetic and Or59b which responds to Ethyl acetate. The transcription levels of Or83b and Or59b were assessed by comparing them with a constitutive gene rpII140 (RNA polymerase II 140kD subunit) in conditioned and unconditioned flies. The results show that there is no significant increase in the transcript levels of either Or83b or Or59b due to conditioning by Ethyl acetate.

His recent collaborative work has been on the function of Myosin VI. This myosin has been studied in both a monomeric and a dimeric form in vitro. Since the functional characteristics of the motor are dramatically different for these two forms, it is important to understand whether myosin VI heavy chains are brought together on endocytic vesicles. The Mayor and Spudich groups have used fluorescence anisotropy measurements to detect fluorescence resonance energy transfer between identical fluorophores (homoFRET) resulting from myosin VI heavy chains being brought into close proximity. They observed that, when associated with clathrin-mediated endocytic vesicles, myosin VI heavy chains are precisely positioned to bring their tail domains in close proximity. They show that on endocytic vesicles, myosin VI heavy chains are brought together in an orientation that previous in vitro studies have shown causes dimerization of the motor. Their results are therefore consistent with vesicle-associated myosin VI existing as a processive dimer, capable of its known trafficking function.

The ongoing joint project involves the study of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor stability at the cell membrane and its internalization. This receptor is a key molecule involved in the propagation of signals in the central nervous system and peripheral synapses. It is involved in functions such as consciousness, attention, and memory; alteration of those functions gives rise to various invalidating pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia, making this family of receptors very important drug targets. The collaborative research with Prof. Mayor has disclosed a hitherto unknown slow-down endocytic mechanism operative in the muscle-type acetylcholine receptor, distinct from the canonical caveolin- and clathrin-dependent pathways. A similar mechanism may be operative in the brain in the case of neuronal receptors, and constitute a modulatory process involved in synaptic plasticity. adjunct and visiting professorsNCBS is fortunate to have excellent interactions with colleagues whose primary appointment is at other institutions in India and abroad.

Our graduate programs leading to PhD degrees come in two flavours. Many of our students join for a PhD after a Masters degree in a basic science discipline or after a Bachelors degree in an applied science discipline like engineering or Medicine. We also have students joining for an Integrated MS-PhD program after a Bachelors degree in basic sciences. In addition, we have a few students working towards a Masters by research. All our students undertake a rigorous coursework programme and participate in research leading to a thesis to be submitted for evaluation. Through a separate entrance test we will now also admit students for a Masters program in Wildlife Biology & Conservation, in collaboration with Centre for Wildlife Studies, Bangalore. The majority of students register with TIFR at Mumbai. however, for several years we have had an excellent relationship with the Manipal Academy for higher education (MAhe) and students working at nCBS can continue to register with either MAhe or Mysore University if needed. This is particularly so for students working on externally-funded PhDs, like those on grants and with their own fellowships from agencies such as CSIR, DBT or ICMR. We continue our close ties with our former hosts, the Indian Institute of Science and our current hosts, the University of Agricultural Sciences. new links are being built through Memoranda of Understanding with several other institutions in India and abroad. Apart from students working towards academic degrees, we have a comparable number of young folk working on projects funded by external agencies. A smaller population of enthusiastic Post Doctoral Fellows brings with them both the expertise and the perspectives of their respective graduate programmes from all over the country and abroad. More transiently, we have an almost continuous stream of trainees visiting from all over the country and carrying out short 6-8 week projects at nCBS, getting some exposure to biological research here and spreading the excitement on their return to their home institutions. We also host a limited number of Masters students for their MSc thesis projects usually carried out over a 6-month period. With the recent nCBS/harvard-MIT student exchange program in place we have begun hosting undergraduates from these internationally renowned institutions for a period of three months every summer. Similar student exchange programs with other international Universities, including the University of Cambridge, are planned. A large number of scientists both national and international and students from all over the country participate in our Annual Symposia. Intellectual diversity is as important for us as cultural variety and both are critical for driving interdisciplinary research. We have an active iBio (integrative Biology) program in collaboration with the Raman Research Institute and enthusiastic interactions with chemists and physicists from several institutions. We are keen to foster relations with medical institutions and to this end have initiated several joint programs for research with faculty at the Christian Medical College, Vellore. With the energy of youth and the vigorous admixture of inputs from diverse backgrounds, the Centre is kept in a ferment, receptive of new ideas and striving to build on accomplishments. Gaiti hasan Head, Academic Activitiesoverview NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 143 7/10/08 5:36:57 PMPrograms PhD Program The national Centre for Biological Sciences has academic programs leading to PhD and Integrated PhD degrees. The PhD program at nCBS accepts candidates with a Masters in any basic science discipline or a basic degree in any applied science such as Medicine, engineering, Pharmacy and Veterinary Science. The Integrated PhD program takes on students with an excellent academic record at the BSc level and who are strongly motivated to pursue a career in research. Interdisciplinary Research Program iBio is a interdisciplinary program that seeks to apply the experimental and theoretical tools of the physical sciences to the study of challenging biological problems. The program provides a stimulating research environment, with dynamic young faculty, state-of-the-art equipment, and international exposure through conferences, workshops, and visiting scientists from around the world. The iBio faculty at nCBS includes chemists, physicists, neuroscientists, and computational biologists. exceptional candidates with strong backgrounds in the physical sciences, including experimental and theoretical physicists, chemists, mathematicians, computer scientists, and engineers are eligible to enter the iBio PhD and postdoctoral programs. We also encourage talented medical students with an interest in biomedical research to pursue a PhD degree at nCBS. The academic programs at nCBS include basic and advanced courses, but emphasise research. The programs are full-time and students often put in over 12 hours of work in a day between course work and a research program. A qualifying examination is held during the second year of each of these programs to decide on whether a student is eligible to go on to work toward a PhD. Students register with the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. Advertisements for applications to all programs appear in leading national newspapers in September/October each year, for a nation-wide written test conducted in mid December. Past academic performance, letters of recommendation from current/former teachers, performance in the written test, and individual write ups in the applications are considered in short listing candidates for the interview held at the end of May/ beginning of June. The new academic year begins in August.Visiting Students/Training Program The training program at nCBS is open to interested and motivated pre-doctoral candidates and usually comprises M.Sc. students between their first and second years. Many students also do their Masters projects here. engineering and medical students are also encouraged to apply. Applications are accepted all through the year. Individual faculty members choose the students they will accommodate in their laboratories. Many of the Centre's trainees find their research experience invaluable. Perhaps the most tangible benefits of this program are manifest in the number of such trainees who are enrolled for a degree in the best research laboratories within the country and outside. Teacher Trainees In addition to training fresh graduates, nCBS also has an active Teacher Training program wherein college and university teachers carry out research leading to a PhD degree. It is hoped that such programs will improve the interaction between universities and research institutes in a mutually beneficial manner. Our recruitment to this program is extremely informal. A teacher who is interested contacts a faculty member at nCBS whose research interests most closely match his/her own. On the faculty member's recommendation, the candidacy is evaluated by a committee on a case-by-case basis. Postdoctoral Positions nCBS has an active postdoctoral (visiting) fellow training program. Postdoctoral fellows usually work with one of the existing groups. Fellowships are tenable for one to three years. Interested individuals are encouraged to write to the head, Academic Activities with their curriculum vitae and the names of at least three referees. Applications will be accepted throughout the year. Decisions on award of postdoctoral fellowships are made twice a year, in February and August. In addition to nCBS-funded Fellowships, some grants also fund Post-doctoral and Junior Research Fellow positions. Appointments to these positions are made as and when they become available, and applications are accepted through the year.

Very little at the moment; but this will change once Dipti Humraskar finishes her Master's research. Her work on the ecology and behaviour of these amazing little gliding lizards of the Western Ghats is soon to begin. Dipti is one of 15 students in the second batch of the MSc course in Wildlife Biology & Conservation, run jointly by a consortium of organizations and housed at NCBS. She and her classmates are busy getting ready for the last semester of their program, in which each will design and execute a research study and write a dissertation based on it. Why do leopards kill livestock and what can be done to mitigate the resulting conflict with humans? What are the causes of mortality of hatchling sea turtles emerging from their nests? Do rodents alter the population dynamics of rainforest trees by carrying away and burying seeds? What explains variation in the gut parasites of Gir lions? What are the habitat requirements of Gangetic dolphins? These are some of the questions that will be addressed by students of the 2006-2008 batch. They come from a diversity of backgrounds: Medicine, Veterinary Science, English, Geography, Zoology and Psychology. But they share a deep passion for nature and the environment, and are preparing to fan out across India to do their projects: from Rajasthan to Arunachal Pradesh, and from Kerala to Himachal Pradesh. The earth's biodiversity is declining rapidly because of changes in the environment at global and local scales. Faced with this decline, it has become critical for us to understand patterns of biodiversity and natural resources, the ecological and evolutionary processes they depend on, their value to humans, their role in ecosystems, the causes underlying their decline, and ways to halt and reverse this decline. The \"wildlife course\" (as it is known for short) teaches enthusiastic students from all over the country how to address these issues. The dissertation projects follow one and a half years of coursework on the philosophy of science, quantitative methods, conservation genetics, ecological principles, animal behaviour, the social sciences and much more. Sprinkled in between courses are field trips to a variety of natural areas to give the students hands-on experience in designing research projects and in practicing field techniques. Field trips always generate humorous anecdotes: about an instructor's bright magenta leech-proof socks, about malfunctioning GPS units causing a wild-goose chase in Periyar, about a student's uncanny ability to smell elephants at 400 metres... But it's certainly not all fun and games - there are real hazards associated with fieldwork, including poisonous plants, ticks, leeches and snakes; being mock-charged by an elephant in Nagarahole is not an experience the second batch is likely to forget soon. The course was started in 2004 by the Centre for Wildlife Studies (CWS), the National Institute for Advanced Studies (NIAS), the Manipal Academy for Higher Education (MAHE), and NCBS. Students are taught by faculty from these organizations as well as by guest faculty from across the country. The course has attracted great interest, with nearly 300 candidates applying for the first batch and nearly 500 for the second. The 15 students of the first batch (which ended in 2006) have now dispersed; some have joined PhD programs and others are working for wildlife and conservation NGOs. Since they graduated, they have published papers in leading journals in the field, and have won awards at international conferences for their dissertation research. The success of the first two batches and the growing importance of this field of biology have prompted NCBS to take a larger role. From the third batch (beginning in August 2008), the course will be run by NCBS (with continuing financial and academic support from CWS), and the degree awarded by TIFR. With this, NCBS formally brings under its umbrella training and research in wildlife, ecology, and the environment; critical areas for continued human well-being in a rapidly world.

Ample space will become available to initiate or augment existing centralized research facilities. These will include a transgenic animal facility as well as a spectroscopy and mass spectrometry facility. Imaging, computing and the library will have new space to expand into. Much effort has gone into planning the new building by our project and engineering staff. Intensive discussions with scientists at nCBS and elsewhere, as well as visits to laboratories in other countries, were part of the planning process. A new architect was selected, and a plan has been finalized for a new modern-looking building juxtaposed next to our now ten year old castle-like building. Major highlights of the design of the new building include shared rather than individual laboratory space, and a built-in flexibility that will allow easy reorganization for any new activity, for many years to come. The past two years have seen the establishment of a genuinely world-class central imaging and flow facility (CIFF), largely due to the perseverance of Drs Mayor and Shivashankar. The range of optical and force microscopy imaging, as well as cell flow capabilities, now available at nCBS, matches or surpasses that available at most biology departments anywhere else in the world. In this context, it is important to appreciate the efforts of the people who manage our evolving centralized research facilities. Dr Krishnamoorthy of the CIFF, Dr Mohan of the Animal Facility, Dr Deepalakshmi of the Mass Spectrometry Facility, and Dr Ain of the budding Transgenic Animal Facility play specialized roles that enable students to carry out their experiments in many different and innovative ways. Major reorganization of existing laboratories has also occurred over the past year, with the joining of a Young Investigator, Dr Quader as well as two new faculty members, Drs nair and Sane. In addition, two joint faculty members, Drs Rodrigues and Krishnan transferred their research activities fully to nCBS from TIFR, Mumbai. Administration and engineering staff moved from occupying laboratory space to a swanky new building. Staff members of the Research Services and engineering Services, the Project office, as well as of the Administration, ensured that the reorganization of laboratory space occurred with relatively little disruption to ongoing activities. As the centre has continued to grow, with now 25 independent research groups, it has become necessary to share responsibilities in more formal ways. Dr Mayor became Chairman of our engineering and Maintenance Services Committee, and now oversees the functioning of an activity critical to the efficient functioning of the centre. Dr Bhalla became Chairman of the Research Services Committee, and supervises the functioning of our research support staff, which enables efficiency in our research endeavors.

Construction starting soon. 161 SUPPORT NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 161 7/10/08 5:37:14 PMWhat is loosely called the 'administration' at nCBS is really the mesh of services that range from engineering and architecture, laboratory maintenance, campus services, new developments and the core finance and general administration required for all of these. The efficient functioning of the centre is a consequence of all of us interacting as a team. each major area has its head, who reports to the nCBS Director. As head of Administrator and Finance, this report only touches on most aspects non-academic functioning and is intended as an overview. During this period, we have constructed an extension to our existing academic and research block building, set up a state-of-the-art imaging and flow facility and established new laboratories for our scientists. Along with this, we have handled a range of administrative and financial functions ranging from recruitment of faculty, staff, research scholars, financial budget & accounts and have managed our ever growing meetings and workshop programme. If managing our growth over the last five years is viewed as being, at least, modestly successful we are also aware that every success had its challenges. We have viewed every challenge in a positive manner and have negotiated them in an innovative way. The chart below summarises our financial position for last five fiscal years (April 02 - March 07): As can be seen from the table, we have continued to spend a major portion of our budget on research. Our salary budget constitutes around 9 percent of our total budget and has remained at this level for the last five years. Part of the reason is that to be operationally effective and cost efficient, we outsource our routine maintenance and support services. however in doing so, we ensure that the contractual obligations are fulfilled with quality. We have continued to receive a significant portion of our budgetary support from extra Mural Grants. Our scientists have been extraordinarily successful in generating national and international funding. From Rs.36 million in 2002-03 we have been able to raise our extra mural funding to the level of Rs.125 million in 2006-07. The strong external support that we have obtained speaks highly about the drive of our various research groups. To facilitate effective research, in addition to an excellent administration and finance group, we have a highly dedicated and competent engineering Services & Maintenance Group. The role of this group has been crucial, as they have been instrumental in construction of our Mandara hostel, extension Block to the current Academic and Research Block, Central Imaging and Flow Facility and modification of various laboratories for the scientists during the last five years. The engineering Services and Maintenance Group have ensured that these facilities are constructed in an aesthetic manner. Currently, this group is concentrating its efforts on construction of a state-of-the-art laboratory building for scientists who Administration Finance and engineering services Salaries Operational Expenses Research & s and Re search Fe llows on Grants Post Doctor al Fe llows Scient ific and Te chnical Staff Administra tive Staff Faculty Young Investigators Meetings , Symposium, Wo rkshop & Pu blic Le ctureswould be carrying out research in frontier areas of biology and other inter-disciplinary areas. Along with this, a new dining-cum-sports complex at the present campus and a housing complex at Chikkabommasandra is also being planned. It is expected that the construction will be completed by the middle of 2010. Given the growth that we have experienced during the last five years as service providers (Administration, Accounts, Purchase and engineering Services) we have strived to adopt the best practices that enable us to provide 'just-in-time' service to our scientific community to facilitate their research pursuits. In the coming years we also hope to pay substantial attention to ensuring that the best employee welfare and benefits programme are put in place. This and a robust mechanism of feedback from employees and other comments in general will be a major goal. We will continue to function in an innovative manner that will enable us to harness our available resources in an efficient manner. nCBS during the next coming years is headed for a phase that will create a lasting impression in the scientific world. One thing we know for sure that, the last five years has been the most interesting phase and the future holds surprises. We need to create a capacity to respond to such surprises. We view the modest success that we have met in the past as not our destination but a journey. In this journey we are committed to the idea of creating value and will endeavour to build a set of institutional values. We are certain that these institutional values will help all in the long run. Before I end, I would like to sincerely thank all my colleagues for their support. The support of my colleagues have helped us to tide over the difficult times and testing phases in a successful manner. I am confident that all my colleagues will continue to do the same. Pradip PyneHead, Administration and FinanceOur growth over the last five years is summarised below: 163 SUPPORT NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 163 7/10/08 5:37:16 PMMany research programs at nCBS rely heavily on the latest methods in bio-imaging and flow cytometry. The Central Imaging and Flow Cytometry Facility (CIFF), with its state-of-the-art equipment, has been set up to meet these needs. Although conceptualized in 2005, it was fully realized in 2006-2007 through national and international funds generated by nCBS faculty. The CIFF not only caters to our institutional needs but also to researchers from all over India and abroad. Further, we train individual researchers to operate microscopes and flow cytometers at the CIFF. To this end, the CIFF offers regular training programs for new users and it currently has more than 90 well-trained users. nCBS has also formed strong links with several well-known manufacturers of high-end microscopes and flow cytometers. This, in turn, has enabled these manufacturers to station several imaging systems at the CIFF. The open usage system at the CIFF coupled with its strong training program make it worthwhile for these manufacturers to demonstrate the versatility and performance of their instruments to potential buyers, while they serve the imaging needs of nCBS. These facilities are briefly described below. Additional details on workshops and training programs conducted at these facilties, along with a list of research publications from these, are available at http://www.ncbs.res.in/researchinfra/flowcytometry.htm NCBS-Olympus micro-imaging centre (NOMIC) This centre was created in association with the Olympus Corporation, Japan. Olympus has installed six high-end fluorescence microscopes at nCBS for two years, which will be used for conducting imaging workshops and microscopy courses. NCBS-zeISS advanced imaging and microscopy training platform A similar understanding has been reached with Carl ZeISS, Germany where an advanced imaging and microscopy platform has been installed in the CIFF. Carl ZeISS has located its LSM 5 LIVe system as well as the LSM 510 Meta at nCBS. These imaging platforms will also be part of microscopy training programs and workshops. BD-NCBS centre for excellence in flow cytometry This centre, which has been set up in association with Becton Dickinson, India, has led to the installation of a high-speed sorter, the FACS Aria, for user-training and Krishnamurthy staff: B S Srinag, B Smitha and S Gopal Faculty Coordinators: S Mayor and A Sarinthe central imaging and Flow cytometry Facility (ci FF) NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 164 7/10/08 5:37:19 PMTransgenic and knockout mice facility Transgenic and knockout mice are a key resource in cell and developmental biology. nCBS has now reached a size where several faculty members have steady, yet small, requirements for their respective programs. Generating these mice require technologies that are well-established. Yet, implementing them in an efficient and sustainable manner would require nCBS to establish the necessary infrastructure and technical expertise. To this end, nCBS has signed an agreement with the RIKen Cell and Developmental Biology (CDB) Institute at Kobe, Japan. The CDB mouse facility, led by Dr. Shin Aizawa, has agreed to make several transgenic and knockout mice for nCBS each year. In addition, CDB is working closely with nCBS to establish our mouse facility and provide technical advice. Facility Manager: Rupasri Ain Faculty Co-ordinators: K VijayRaghavan and S Chattarji Staff: S Uma and S Srinivasan Drosophila stock maintenance and screening facility The availability of the complete annotated sequence of the Drosophila genome coupled with the invention of a number of elegant genetic techniques has made the fruit fly a more attractive model system than ever before. It is the system of choice, not only for the investigation of a variety of basic cellular principles, but also for the more applied areas of clinically driven research, drug testing and pharmacology. There is a resurgence of interest in carrying out large scale, genome wide, screens to identify genes important for understanding mechanisms in cell biology, neuroscience and the development of behavior. The Drosophila centre maintains a large number of mutant strains and transgenic lines. In addition, the facility offers a microinjection service for the generation of transgenic lines. The facility aims to hold frequent meetings, discussion sessions and co-ordinate with other research groups to facilitate large scale genetic screens. Staff: S G Gajendra Faculty Co-ordinator: V ) The TC nB was created through generous funding obtained from the nanoScience and Technology Initiative of the Department of Science and Technology, India in 2005. The primary aim of TC nB is to augment infrastructure capabilities at nCBS to study nano-scale architecture and phenomena in living systems in real time, with a focus on developing new bio-inspired nanodevices. These devices and technologies are likely to be deployed in the visualization of sub-cellular and cellular processes at temporal and spatial resolution previously unachievable. Additional details on the wide range of exciting research and technology emerging from this centre is available at: www.ncbs.res.in Faculty Co-ordinators: G V Shivashankar, S Mayor, Y Krishnan and K VijayRaghavan Cell-based high content screening facility new molecular players in cellular processes are being identified worldwide through large-scale screens. Given its strengths in imaging, nCBS is perfectly positioned to establish, in an academic setting, high content high throughput (hC hT) imaging-based screens. The Technology Centre for nanoBiosystems has created a screening facility that will establish the hChT approach initially through genome-wide RnAi screens for cellular scale phenomena of interest at nCBS. The know-how from the establishment of such screens will subsequently be adapted for hChT approaches for screening small-molecule libraries.

Jayant, whose science has been extraordinary in quality and in volume for several years, would like to devote more time to his laboratory. Jayant joined us before NCBS formally came into being. It can rightly be said that while the concept of NCBS required Obaid Siddiqi, transforming this into reality required Jayant Udgaonkar. Jayant has been the pillar of robust good-sense and best-practice and the pivot around which all aspects of NCBS have grown. Our hiring of faculty and staff, administrative structure, buildings, architecture, landscape: indeed every facet has relied on him to set the standards for both innovation and correctness. This afforded several of us the invaluable luxury of being sloppy, speculative and irresponsible. We could always explore freely, in the full confidence that our moral and scientific pivot would not allow us to stray and translate a poorly-formulated whim or fancy of the day into unwise action. Jayant thus developed a paradigm for a structure that could be innovative, yet structured. NCBS owes him a great debt - he would typically say that he was just doing his job - and we are fortunate that we will continue to have him advise and participate in our forthcoming ventures. Satyajit Mayor takes over as our new Dean. Jitu has become a world-leader in his area of research in cell biology. NCBS may lay claims to have nurtured him, and be pleased, but this is a man who would have done great work anywhere and no place could have stopped him (we didn't try). In addition to his science, Jitu has taken the leadership to establish one of the best imaging and cell-sorting facilities in the world and is now following this up to establish a genetic screening facility of a similar quality. His science, his leadership and his judgement ensure that, in him, we have a Dean of the highest quality.thanking a dean and welcoming another NCBS_AR_05_07.indd 176 7/10/08 5:37:36 PMThe NCBS campus is lucky to have open green spaces, many trees, bushes (w-free), flowering plants, migrating butterflies, geckos, bees and bats. We are located in the postgraduate campus of the University of Agricultural Sciences, which has generously leased us 20 acres. Our visitors and us have a pleasant, quiet and green environment to work and relax. We have terrace cafeterias where coffee, snacks and light meals are served and birthdays celebrated. Several handy chalkboards have made these cafeterias centers for discussion. Some of these discussions have recently crystallized into a student-run symposium exploring different areas in biology. A larger (soon to be expanded) canteen serves full meals from breakfast to dinner. The canteen is located near a pond fed by harvested rainwater and clean water from treated sewage. The pond-side is where we gather for dinner after on-campus symposia and public lectures. We have an amphitheater that serves as an interactive place for tea after scientifically exciting seminars. Facilities for tennis, basketball, volleyball, badminton, table tennis and a gym are all available. We provide transport to all members of the community into the ever-expanding Bangalore city. We also help our staff and faculty with their commute to work. We have excellent accommodation for students and post-doctoral fellows. We accommodate some faculty on campus and the rest in comfortable apartments and houses close to campus. We do need to expand our campus housing for faculty as well as our excellent administrative and technical staff. In the near future we hope to expand our hostel, sports facilities and housing to keep pace with our scientific growth. One major factor that enhances the quality of life on campus is our on-campus child-care and after-school program. This facility aims to be a complete one-stop solution for child-care for children from the ages of 1 to 10 years. The campus environment provides space, lush greenery, a park and a sand pit for children to play and learn. Over the years, our teachers, staff, several visiting consultants, parents and exceptional institutional support have helped develop the childcare center into an excellent facility. The day-to-day affairs of the facility are coordinated by several experienced teachers. The NCBS community at large provides a rich learning environment. We have several artists, wildlife lovers, storytellers and musicians on campus who informally participate in various activities at the child care center. We have age appropriate fun and educational activities for infants, toddlers, pre-school and school going children. Current efforts are geared towards developing a stimulating after-school program supplemented with off-campus activities such as swimming, volunteer work and music in addition to homework and examination-related studies. We also undertake field trips to various locations such as parks, science museums, circuses and dance concerts. Good childcare is a major factor that achieves a supportive workplace for working parents. We aim to provide a facility that recognizes the needs of working parents while providing children with a nurturing environment.Quality of life at ncBs: what we have and where we aim to be LIFe AT nCBS 177 NCBS_AR_05_07.indd innovative exhibit \"Such Treasure and Rich Merchandize\" at the National Center For Biological Sciences/TIFR held in early 2008 brought together science, art and social history in a compelling fashion. The exhibit began with a large walk-through drop down of an Indian Ficus tree from John Gerard's Herbal and ended with a list of 50 single molecule drugs in use today isolated from botanicals. Beautiful botanical illustrations of Indian plants in european books published from the 16th and 17th centuries, maps, and cityscapes of Indian port cities were used to trace the story of how the search for spices led to the discovery of a wealth of information on Indian plants, their medicinal uses available in India and the importance of that knowledge to science and medicine in europe and also to the development of botany as a science. Woven into the narrative were excerpts from Shakespeare, the Portuguese poet Camoens, Milton and other writers of the period and a marvelous image of the Indian elephant \"Hanno\" by the renaissance master Raphael, evocatively represented on a variety of materials such as glass, stone and fabric. You could walk through a herbal garden based on many of the plants described in the volumes or browse through a digital flipbook of the book in focus - the Hortus Malabaricus. This exhibit offered something for the scientist, artist, social historian and everyone interested in the history of India. The exhibit was curated by Annamma Spudich, Scholar in Residence at NCBS. Annamma Spudich is a cell biologist (Ph.D., Stanford University) with a life long interest in the history of Indian scientific traditions in the natural sciences. In 2003 Dr. Spudich curated the exhibit \"From Forreine Places All the Varietie of Herbes\" at The Cantor Center for Visual Arts, Stanford University. The exhibition at the NCBS and related collateral was designed and coordinated by Sarita Sundar and her team at Trapeze, a multi-disciplinary design consultancy and studio. The design team worked with the curator to reproduce and present material from various libraries and collections throughout the world and present an informative and novel look at the history of e ast-West interaction in the pre-colonial period, focused on the natural sciences. such treasure and rich merchandize 179 5:37:51 PM "}
