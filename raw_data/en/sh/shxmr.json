Please note that decisions on vaccination phase definitions, timing and participation are defined by State and local health departments. Additionally, each county will move through distribution phases at differing times dependent upon on vaccine allocation quantities and participation levels within the community. Based on the definitions of each phase, it is the Department's interpretation that direct service provider staff (In -Home, Parent Aide, SVO, FAS, etc. ) are eligible to participate in Phase 1B. This is speci fic to those staff members working directly with children and families in the community and does not include staff solely supporting virtual services or opera tional positions. Congregate C are provider staff are included in distribution phase 1C unless ot herwise stated by local county health. At this time our caregivers (kinship/foster) are part of Phase 2, public distribution of the vaccine unless they meet another qualification. Please reference the DHS vaccination rollout plan HERE . The Department of Child Safety does not require that our staff, provider staff or congregate care staff receive the COVID -19 vaccination. This is everyone 's personal decision. Regardless if an individual has received the vaccine, all safety protocols including use of PPE, temperature checks and other requirements remain in place until further notice. Providers and Congregate C are staff need to review their local county health department requirements on how to sign up and receive a vaccine when the county enters the appropriate distribution phase. Other than advocacy for participation, the Department is not involved in the distribution of the vaccine and is limited in what questions can be answered. The Department is currently reviewing vaccination guidance for youth in care with our Chief Medical Officer and communication will be forthcoming as it becomes available. We are continually thankful for all you do and your efforts to support our shared mission. Page 2 Sincerely, Mike Faust Director "}
