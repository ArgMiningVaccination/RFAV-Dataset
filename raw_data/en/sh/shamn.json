It filters the blood coming from the digestive tract before it passes to the body. Other important functions of the liver are metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and amino acids in the body; production of bile that help in breaking down the fat and detoxification of chemicals and drugs. Its other functions include producing blood clotting factors, storage of glucose and clearance of bilirubin. Many factors can cause liver problems, but the major among them are virus infections, alcohol consumption and obesity. Liver problems can occur in persons of all age groups and may be genetic. Liver problems, if not treated in time, can lead to liver failure and prove life threatening. Homeopathic Treatment Homeopathy is the science of healing which is very effective in treating both acute and chronic liver problems. Homeopathy takes a holistic approach to healing. Homeopathic medicines are deep acting and have no side effects on the body. Unlike the conventional mode of medicine, Homeopathic medicines do not suppress the disease and its symptoms. In fact, they attack the disorder at the root and set off the body's own restorative processes, making it strong enough to completely eradicate the disease. Suppressing the disease process makes it stubborn. Once the body's own immune system is strengthened, it prevents further recurrence of the disease.
