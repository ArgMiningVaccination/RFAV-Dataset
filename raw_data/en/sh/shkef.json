Short -term outlook General economic outlook Global growth is projected t o rise from an estimated 2.9 percent in 2019 to 3.3 percent in 2020 and 3.4 percent for 2021. Market sentiment has been boosted by tentative signs that manufacturing activity and global trade are bottoming out, a broad -based shift toward accommodative mone tary policy, intermittent favorable news on US -China trade negotiations, and diminished fears of a no -deal Brexit. Downside risks, however, remain prominent, including rising geopolitical tensions, notably between the United States and Iran, intensifying s ocial unrest, further worsening of relations between the United States and its trading partners, and deepening economic frictions between other countries. A materialization of these risks could lead to rapidly deteriorating sentiment, causing global growth to fall below the projected baseline. (International Monetary Fund, January 2020) Short -term market outlook Valmet reiterates the good short -term market outlook for services, automation, pulp, and board and paper, and the satisfactory short -term market o utlook for energy, and tissue.

The stock exchange release and an introduction of the new Chairman can be viewed on V almet's website at www.valmet.com/agm. In compliance with the resolution of the Annual General Meeting, on April 4, 2019 Valmet paid out dividends of EUR 97 million for 2018, corresponding to EUR 0.65 per share. Risks and business uncertainties Valmet's op erations are affected by various strategic, financial, operational and hazard risks. Valmet takes measures to exploit emerging opportunities and to limit the adverse effects of potential threats. The assessment of risks related to sustainable development h olds an important role in risk management. If such threats materialized, they could have material adverse effects on Valmet's business, financial situation and operating result, or on the value of shares and other securities. The objective of Valmet's ris k management is to ensure the implementation of an effective and successful strategy for achieving both long - and short -term goals. The task of Valmet's management is to regulate risk appetite. In assessing risks, Valmet takes into consideration the proba bility of the risks and their estimated impact on net sales and financial results. Valmet's management estimates that the Company's overall risk level is currently manageable in proportion to the scope of its operations and the practical measures available for managing these risks. Financial uncertainty in the global economy, coupled with fluctuations in exchange rates and tightening financial market regulations, may have an adverse effect on the availability of financing from banks and capital markets and could reduce the investment appetite of Valmet's customers. Valmet estimates that the high proportion of business derived from stable business (Services and Automation) and the geographical diversification will reduce the possible negative effects that ma rket uncertainties may have. Valmet's Financial Statements Review 2019| 23 If global economic growth weakens, it might have adverse effects on new projects under negotiation or on projects in the order backlog. Some projects may be postponed, suspended, or canceled. In the case of long -term delivery projects, initial customer advance payments are typically 10 -30 percent of the value of the project, and customers make progress payments as the project is implemented. This significantly decreases the risks and financing requirements related to Valmet's p rojects. Valmet continually assesses its customers' creditworthiness and their ability to meet their obligations. As a rule, Valmet does not finance customer projects. If economic growth slows down significantly, the markets for Valmet's products may shrin k, which may lead to, for example, tougher price competition. Changes and uncertainty in future regulation and legislation can also have critical effect s, especially on the energy business. Large fluctuations in energy prices can affect the global economy . These fluctuations can also affect Valmet and its customers, especially in the energy business. Changes in labor costs and the prices of raw materials and components can affect Valmet's profitability. Wage inflation is continuing, but Valmet's goal is to offset this at least partly through increased productivity and strict price discipline. It is possible, however, that tough competition in some product categories will make it difficult to pass on cost increases to product prices. On the other hand, some of Valmet's customers are raw material producers and their ability to operate and invest may be enhanced by strengthening commodity prices and hampered by declining commodity prices. To ensure a high level of quality in both production and services, it is important to sustain a high level of competence and talent availability. This includes, for example, maintaining efficient recruitment programs, utilization of existing talent and sharing knowledge globally. Through acquisitions , Valmet may become exposed to risks associated with new markets and business environments. The actual acquisition process also includes risks. Other risks associated with acquisitions include, but are not limited to, integration of the acquired business, i ncreased financial risk exposure, retention of key personnel and achieving the targets set for the acquired business. Management of project business risks important An important part of Valmet's business consists of project business. Pulp business projects in particular can be large, thus project -specific risk management is crucial. Key risks related to projects are project cost estimation, scheduling, project risk management, quality and performance risks, and materials management risks. Risk analysis shal l, as a minimum, take place for all significant project quotations. The work concerning threat and opportunity assessment continues during the execution phase of the project. Risk management is based on careful planning and continuous, systematic monitorin g and evaluation. Project risks are managed by improving and continuously developing project management processes and the related systems. There may be changes in the competitive situation of Valmet's individual businesses, such as the emergence of new, c ost-effective competition in the markets. Valmet can safeguard its market position by developing its products and services, and through good customer service and local presence. Availability of financing crucial Securing the continuity of Valmet's operati ons requires sufficient available funding under all circumstances. Valmet estimates that its liquid cash assets and committed credit limits are sufficient to secure its Valmet's Financial Statements Review 2019| 24 immediate liquidity and to ensure the flexibility of financing. The average maturity of Valmet's non -current debt, excluding lease liabilities, is 3. 1 years. Loan facilities include customary covenants, and Valmet is in clear compliance with the covenants at the balance sheet date. Net working capital and capital expenditure levels have a ke y impact on the adequacy of Valmet's financing. Setting aside investments into the renewal of the ERP system, Valmet does not expect any significant increase in annual capital expenditure. Depreciation expense increase d in 2019 following the adoption of th e new lease accounting standard (IFRS 16). Of the financial risks that affect Valmet's profit, currency exchange rate risks are among the most substantial. Exchange rate changes can affect Valmet's business, although the wide geographical scope of the Comp any's operations reduces the impact of any individual currency. Economic insecurity typically increases exchange rate fluctuations. Valmet hedges its currency exposures linked to firm delivery and purchase agreements. Changes in legislation and the way au thorities interpret regulation, for example regarding taxation, can also have an impact on Valmet's financials. At the end of December 2019, Valmet had EUR 687 million (EUR 61 7 million) of goodwill on its statement of financial position. Valmet assesses th e value of its goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that a risk of impairment exists. Valmet has not identified any indications of impairment during the reporting period. The principles used for impairmen t testing are presented in the Financial Statements. Events after the reporting period Valmet announced on January 21, 2020 that it is planning changes in the Fabrics Business Unit which is part of the Services Business Line in order to secure the unit's profitability and future competitiveness. The most important action in the preliminary plan is to move the dryer fabric and wide filter fabric production from Tampere in Finland to Valmet's unit in Portugal. As a consequence of the above, Valmet sta rted co- determination negotiations in Fabrics' operations in Tampere on January 21, 2020. The co -determination negotiations can result in the reduction of 90 persons at maximum mainly during year 2021 by estimate, and in possible temporary lay -offs and par t-time work during 2020. Guidance for 2020 Valmet estimates that net sales in 2020 will increase in comparison with 2019 (EUR 3,547 million) and Comparable EBITA in 2020 will increase in comparison with 2019 (EUR 316 million). Short -term outlook General economic outlook Global growth is projected to rise from an estimated 2.9 percent in 2019 to 3.3 percent in 2020 and 3.4 percent for 2021. Market sentiment has been boosted by tentative signs that manufacturing activity and global trade are bottom ing out, a broad -based shift toward accommodative monetary policy, intermittent favorable news on US -China trade negotiations, and diminished fears of a no -deal Brexit. Downside risks, however, remain prominent, including rising geopolitical tensions, nota bly between the United States and Iran, intensifying social unrest, further worsening of relations between the United States and its trading partners, and deepening economic frictions between other countries. A materialization of these risks could Valmet's Financial Statements Review 2019| 25 lead to rapidly deteriorating sentiment, causing global growth to fall below the projected baseline. (International Monetary Fund, January 2020) Short -term market outlook Valmet reiterates the good short -term market outlook for services, automation, pulp, and board and paper, and the satisfactory short -term market outlook for energy, and tissue. Board of Director's proposal for the distribution of profit Valmet Oyj's distributable funds on December 31, 2019 totaled EUR 1,165,761,301.98 of which the net profit f or 2019 was EUR 196,078,447.45 (according to Finnish Generally Accepted Accounting Standards). The Board of Directors proposes that a dividend of EUR 0.80 per share be paid based on the statement of financial position to be adopted for the financial year w hich ended December 31, 2019, and that the remaining part of the profit be retained and carried further in the Company's unrestricted equity. The dividend will be paid to shareholders who on the dividend record date March 23, 2020 are registered in the Co mpany's shareholders' register held by Euroclear Finland Ltd. The dividend will be paid on April 3, 2020. All the shares in the Company are entitled to a dividend except for treasury shares held by the Company on the dividend record date.

These pro forma amounts include in come tax expenses as well as the fair value adjustments, determined as at December 31, 2019, for the January -March period for GL&V and January -April period for J&L Fiber Services. Acquisition related costs of EUR 1 million have been charged to Selling, gen eral and administrative expenses in the Consolidated statement of income in January -December 2019. Acquisition of Enertechnix Process Sensors, Inc. As of October 1, 2018, Valmet acquired 100 percent ownership in Enertechnix Process sensors, Inc. (Enertech nix), a high -tech combustion diagnostics and monitoring technology company based in Washington, USA.

The acquisition had no material e ffect on Valmet's financial statements for 2018. Reporting segment and geographic information The Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is the President and CEO of Valmet. Valmet's four business lines are highly integrated through complementing pro duct and service offerings and joint customer projects. Thus, the operations and profitability of Valmet is reported as a single reportable segment with the key operative decisions being made by the CODM at the Valmet Group level. One key indicator of perf ormance reviewed is Earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA). Performance is also assessed through Comparable EBITA, i.e. with EBITA excluding certain items of income and expense that reduce the comparability of the Group's performance fro m one period to another. The alternative performance measures of EBITA and Comparable EBITA are published by Valmet as part of regulated financial information to enable users of the financial information to prepare more meaningful analysis on Valmet's perf ormance. Items affecting comparability consist of income and expenses arising from activities that amend the capacity of Valmet's operations, such as restructuring costs and gains or losses on sale of businesses or non -current assets, income and expenses i ncurred outside Valmet's normal course of business, such as impairment charges and gains or losses recorded as a result of settlement payments to/from third parties (e.g. penalties incurred as a result of tax audits or settlements to closed Unaudite d condensed consolidated interim financial statements Valmet's financial statements review 2019| 36 lawsuits) as we ll as expenses arising from changes in legislation expected to affect Valmet temporarily only (e.g. customs or other tariffs imposed by authorities on Valmet's products).

Unaudite d condensed consolidated interim financial statements Valmet's financial statements review 2019| 37 Entity -wide information Valmet has operations globally in over 35 countries. Measured by net sales, the top three countries in 2019 and 2018 were the USA, China and Finland, which together accounted for 39 percent of total net sales in 2019 (42%). Net sales for Finland (the count ry of domicile) amounted EUR 298 million in 2019 (EUR 285 million). Net sales by destination: 2019: EUR 3,547 million 2018: EUR 3,325 million Gross capital expenditure (excl. business combinations and leased assets) by location: EUR million North America South America EMEA China Asia -Pacific Total 2019 5 4 55 13 2 79 2018 5 3 61 6 4 79 Revenue Valmet's revenue is reported on and monitored by management in both business line and area dimension. Paper, and Pulp and Energy business lines' revenue is derived from large long -term capital projects, for which revenue is mostly recognized over time based on the cost -to-cost method. Service business line's revenue arises from large volume of short -term contracts with relatively low individ ual value, for which revenue is mainly recognized at a point in time. Automation business line's revenue consists of long -term contracts and short -term service contracts. The nature of long -term contracts, and therefore also the revenue recognition method, is similar to capital projects although with average contract values being lower. Revenue for short -term service contracts is recognized at a point in time. Nature of revenue in each area in any given reporting period is driven by volume and size of ongoi ng capital projects.

During the reporting period Valmet had not entered into any material contracts where the period between when Valmet tran sfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or more. Neither were there any ongoing projects from previous reporting periods for which the former would apply. The creditworthiness of a customer is verified before entering into a contract. However, if a risk of non - payment arises after contract inception, the probability of collection of consideration is re -evaluated and if assessed improbable, recognition of revenue is discontinued. An allowance for non -collectability of open receivables and contract assets is established as concluded appropriate. Valmet receives payments from customers based on invoicing schedules as set out in the customer contracts. Changes in contract assets and liab ilities are due to Valmet's performance under the contracts. Amounts due from customers under revenue contracts primarily relate to Valmet's right to consideration for work completed but not yet invoiced at the reporting date. These assets are transferred to trade receivables when right to consideration becomes unconditional, which is typically at the time when Valmet has contractual right to issue an invoice. Significant part of amounts due to customers relate to advance consideration received from custome r in long -term capital contracts for which revenue is recognized over time. These amounts are recognized as revenue as (or when) Valmet performs under the contracts. Following tables provide specification of movements in amounts due from customers under re venue contracts and amounts due to customers under revenue contracts over the reporting period. Revenue recognized in the period also includes revenue recognized related to performance obligations satisfied in previous periods, the amount of which however is insignificant.

Valmet does not issue service -type warranties. As at December 31, 2019, Valmet had no costs to obtain or fulfill contracts capitalized under IFRS 15. The aggreg ate amount of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations as at December 31, 2019 is EUR 3,333 million. Net working capital Valmet's net working capital is typically negative due to advance payments received from customers related to long -term capital projects.

IFRS 16 replaced IAS 17 - Leases and related interpretations concerning the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. Under IFRS 16 - Leases, a right -of-use asset and a corresponding lease liabilit y is recognized for all identified leases, except for short -term leases with a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low - value assets. On adoption Valmet applied the simplified retrospective approach with the practical expedients provided by IFRS 1 6 as described below. The cumulative effect of adopting IFRS 16 was recognized in the opening balance of retained earnings as at January 1, 2019, and prior periods were not restated. Valmet recognized lease liabilities in relation to leases which had under the principles of IAS 17 been classified as operating leases. Valmet used hindsight when assessing lease term for lease contracts that contained options to extend or terminate the lease. Further, the likely lease terms for open -ended contracts were revise d at transition. Exemptions provided for recognition of right -of-use asset and corresponding liability for leases of low -value assets and short -term leases were also applied at transition. Right -of-use asset was measured as if IFRS 16 had been applied from lease commencement. Lease liabilities were measured at the present value of the future unpaid lease payments discounted using incremental borrowing rates at the date of initial application. The weighted average discount rate at transition was 3.3 percent. The recognized right -of-use asset and lease liability are presented under property, plant and equipment and non -current and current liabilities, respectively. Valmet's operating lease commitments under the principles of IAS 17 - Leases amounted to EUR 57 million as at December 31, 2018, and adoption of IFRS 16 has not had a significant effect in the scope of contracts identified as leases. Below table Unaudite d condensed consolidated interim financial statements Valmet's financial statements review 2019| 41 presents the cumulative effect to the Consolidated statement of financial position from the initial applic ation of IFRS 16.

Contract is considered to contain a lease if it conveys a right to use an either explicitly or implicitly identified asset for a period of time in exc hange for consideration. In lease contracts where Valmet is the lessee, a right -of-use asset and a lease liability is recognized at lease commencement date to reflect Valmet's right to use the underlying asset and unpaid future lease payments respectively. These are presented under property, plant and equipment and non -current and current liabilities. Lease liability is initially measured at an amount equal to the present value of the future lease payments that are not yet paid at the commencement date. As interest rate implicit in the contract is not commonly readily available, incremental borrowing rates reflecting entity -specific factors and lease term are applied to all lease contracts at Valmet when calculating the present value of lease liability and interest expense. Incremental borrowing rates are estimated based on market prices adjusted with calculated margins representing the entity -specific factors such as credit and country risk. In subsequent periods the lease liability is measured using the ef fective interest rate method, and the carrying amount of lease liability is increased with the interest on the lease liability, reduced with the amount of lease payments made, and adjusted to reflect any reassessments or lease modifications made. When the lease liability is remeasured, the corresponding adjustment is reflected in the right -of-use asset. Variable lease payments not based on index or rate are not included in the liability but are expensed as incurred. A right -of-use asset is initially measure d at cost comprising of the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability and any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, any initial direct costs incurred by Valmet, and restoration costs. Subs equently the right -of-use asset is depreciated on a straight -line basis over the shorter of lease term or the useful life of the asset. Unaudite d condensed consolidated interim financial statements Valmet's financial statements review 2019| 42 Valmet applies exemptions provided by the standard not to recognize a right -of-use asset and corresponding lease liability for leases with a contract term of 12 months or less, and for leases of low - value assets. The payments for these leases are recognized as an expense on a straight -line basis over the lease term. Further, Valmet separates non -lease components from lease components only for asset classes in which the amount of non -lease components is significant. Critical accounting estimates and judgments Valmet has a significant volume of open -ended real estate lease contracts which carry a sho rt notice period only, or which have an initial fixed term but carry extension or termination options. Estimating the likely lease term for these contracts and assessing if the options will be exercised requires significant judgement. When assessing the le ase term for these contracts, management considers the relevant facts and circumstances. The likely lease term is typically assessed following the three -year financial forecasts established by management. In case there are specific circumstances in place, such as beneficial market rates, significant leasehold improvements, or other significant direct or indirect costs associated with exiting the lease, lease term can be above three years. Considering other than real estate leases, the need for assets leased under open -ended contracts is commonly short -term in nature, and as such open -ended contracts where the notice period is 12 months or less are accounted for as short -term leases. Significant amount of judgment needs to be exercised in estimating likely le ase term. Valmet's leasing activities Majority of Valmet's lease arrangements concern real estate, vehicles, and machinery and equipment located primarily on Valmet's premises. The length of these lease arrangement is typically 3 to 5 years and contracts m ay include options to extend the lease. Before adoption of IFRS 16 these arrangements were mainly classified as operating leases, and lease expenses were recognized to profit or loss on a straight -line basis over the period of use.

Unaudite d condensed consolidated interim financial statements Valmet's financial statements review 2019| 45 Events after the reporting period Valmet is planning changes in the Fabrics Business Unit which is part of the Services Business Line in order to secure the unit's profitability and future competitiveness. The most important action in the preliminary plan is to move the dryer fabric and wide filter fabric production from T ampere in Finland to Valmet's unit in Portugal. The possible actions will have employee impacts. The functions under consideration are part of Valmet Technologies Oy. As a consequence of the above, Valmet starts co -determination negotiations in Fabrics' op erations in Tampere on January 21, 2020. The co -determination negotiations are estimated to last six weeks and they include Fabrics' personnel in Tampere. The co -determination negotiations can result in the reduction of 90 persons at maximum mainly during year 2021 by estimate, and in possible temporary lay -offs and part -time work during 2020. Fabrics Business Unit employs altogether approximately 500 persons in its Tampere operations. Fabrics Business Unit develops and manufactures press felts, shoe press belts, dryer fabrics and wide filter fabrics in Tampere. Valmet's location in Portugal, to which the dryer fabric and wide filter fabric production possibly is relocated, develops and manufactures filter fabrics and other industrial textiles.
