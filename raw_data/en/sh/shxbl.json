Inside Back Cover11 Santa Clara University Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Santa Clara University is a comprehen - sive Jesuit, Catholic university with more than 8,800 students. Founded in 1851 by the Society of Jesus, California's oldest operating higher education institution offers a rigorous undergraduate curriculum in arts and sciences, business, and engineering, plus nationally recognized graduate and professional programs in business, law, engineering, education, counseling psychology, pastoral ministries, and theology. The University boasts a diverse community of scholars offering a values-oriented curriculum characterized by small class sizes and a dedication to educating students for competence, conscience, and compassion. The traditions of Jesuit education\u2014educating the whole person for a life of service\u2014run deep in all of its curricular and co-curricular programs. Santa Clara University is perennially ranked among the top comprehensive universities by U.S. News & World Report and has one of the highest graduation rates for undergraduate students among all comprehensive universities. The University has a national reputation for its undergraduate program that features a distinctive core curriculum, an integrated learning environment, and research opportunities for undergraduate students. The University was established as Santa Clara College on the site of the Mission Santa Clara de Asis, the eighth of the original 21 California missions. The college originally oper - ated as a preparatory school and did not offer collegiate courses until 1853. Following the Civil War, enrollment increased, and by 1875 the size of the student body was 275. One-third of the students were enrolled in the collegiate division; the remainder attended the college's preparatory and high school departments. Santa Clara experienced slow and steady growth during its first 60 years, becoming the University of Santa Clara in 1912, when the schools of engineering and law were added. In 1925, the high school was separated from the University and took the name of Bellarm - ine College Preparatory in 1928. The Leavey School of Business opened in 1926, and within a decade, became one of the first business schools in the country to receive national accreditation. For 110 years, Santa Clara was an all-male school. In the fall of 1961, women were accepted as undergraduates, and Santa Clara became the first coeducational Catholic university in California. The decision resulted in an admissions explosion\u2014from 1,500 students to more than 5,000. The size of the faculty tripled, and the University began the largest building program in school history, building eight residence halls, a student union, and an athletic stadium. In the early 1970s, the Board of T rustees voted to limit the size of the undergraduate population, an action that was intended to preserve the character and ensure the quality of the University for generations to come. In 1985, the University adopted \"Santa Clara University\" as its official name.2 SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY UNIVERSITY VISION, MISSION, AND FUNDAMENTAL VALUES Santa Clara University has adopted three directional statements to describe the kind of university it aspires to become (Strategic Vision), its core purpose and the constituencies it serves (University Mission), and the beliefs that guide its actions (Fundamental Values). Strategic Vision Santa Clara University will educate citizens and leaders of competence, conscience, and compassion and cultivate knowledge and faith to build a more humane, just, and sus - tainable world.University Mission The University pursues its vision by creating an academic community that educates the whole person within the Jesuit, Catholic tradition, making student learning our central focus, continuously improving our curriculum and co-curriculum, strengthening our schol - arship and creative work, and serving the communities of which we are a part in Silicon Valley and around the world. Student learning takes place at the undergraduate and graduate level in an educational environment that integrates rigorous inquiry and scholarship, creative imagination, reflective engagement with society, and a commitment to fashioning a more humane and just world. As an academic community, we expand the boundaries of knowledge and insight through teaching, research, artistic expression, and other forms of scholarship. It is primarily through discovering, communicating, and applying knowledge that we exercise our institu-tional responsibility as a voice of reason and conscience in society. We offer challenging academic programs and demonstrate a commitment to the development of: Undergraduate students who seek an education with a strong humanistic orientation in a primarily residential setting Graduate students, many of them working professionals in Silicon Valley, who seek advanced degree programs that prepare them to make significant contributions to their fields In addition to these core programs, we also provide a variety of continuing education and professional development opportunities for nonmatriculated students. Fundamental Values The University is committed to these core values, which guide us in carrying out our mission and realizing our vision: Academic Excellence. We seek an uncompromising standard of excellence in teaching, learning, creativity, and scholarship within and across disciplines. Search for Truth, Goodness, and Beauty . We prize scholarship and creative work that advance human understanding, improve teaching and learning, and add to the betterment of society by illuminating the most significant problems of the day and exploring the endur - ing mysteries of life. In this search, our commitment to academic freedom is unwavering. Engaged Learning. We strive to integrate academic reflection and direct experience in the classroom and the community, especially to understand and improve the lives of those with the least education, power, and wealth. Commitment to Students. As teachers and scholars, mentors and facilitators, we endeavor to educate the whole person. We nurture and challenge students\u2014intellectually, spiritually, SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY 3 aesthetically, morally, socially, and physically\u2014preparing them for leadership and service to the common good in their professional, civic, and personal lives. Service to Others . We promote throughout the University a culture of service\u2014service not only to those who study and work at Santa Clara but also to society in general and to its most disadvantaged members as we work with and for others to build a more humane, just, faith-filled, and sustainable world. Community and Diversity . We cherish our diverse and inclusive community of students, faculty, staff, administrators, and alumni, a community that is enriched by people of differ - ent backgrounds, respectful of the dignity of all its members, enlivened by open communi - cation, and caring and just toward others. Jesuit Distinctiveness. We treasure our Jesuit heritage and tradition, which incorporates all of these core values. This tradition gives expression to our Jesuit educational mission and Catholic identity while also welcoming and respecting other religious and philosophical traditions, promoting the dialogue between faith and culture, and valuing opportunities to deepen religious beliefs.

The Department of Education focuses on preparing teachers and administrators for public and Catholic schools. It offers programs in teacher preparation leading to credentials (i.e., California preliminary multiple-subject and single- subject teaching credentials, and California Clear credential) and the master of arts in teaching (MAT) degree. Its programs in educational administration prepare public K-12 administra - tors (i.e., the Preliminary California Administrative Services credential and the California Clear Administrative Services credential), and Catholic school leaders through the certifi - cate program in Catholic School Leadership. The department also offers a M.A. program in interdisciplinary education (with emphases in curriculum and instruction; science, technol - ogy, environmental education, and mathematics (STEEM); and educational administra - tion. The departments of Education and Counseling Psychology jointly offer the certificate program in Alternative and Correctional Education.

The M.A. in counseling psychology can lead to state licensure for marriage and family therapists and/or licensed professional clinical counselors. The department includes emphasis programs in health, correctional, and Latino counseling. On July 1, 2009, the Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley became the Jesuit School of Theology of Santa Clara University. The Jesuit School of Theology is one of only two Jesuit theological centers in the United States operated by the Society of Jesus, as the order of Catholic priests is known. Additionally, it is one of only two Jesuit theological centers in the country that offer three ecclesiastical degrees certified by the Vatican Congregation for Catholic Education, and it also offers four additional advanced theological degrees, as well as sabbatical and certificate programs for clergy, religious, and lay people. CENTERS OF DISTINCTION Santa Clara University has three Centers of Distinction that serve as major points of interaction betw een the University and society. Each center focuses on a theme that is central to Santa Clara's distinctive mission as a Jesuit university and offers an educational environment integrating rigorous inquiry and scholarship, creative imagination, reflective engagement with society, and a commitment to fashioning a more humane and just world. Each center engages faculty and students from different disciplines as well as experts and leaders from the community through speakers, conferences, workshops, and experiential learning opportunities. Center for Science, Technology, and Society The mission of the Center for Science, Technology, and Society is to accelerate global, innovation-based entrepreneurship in service to humanity. Through an array of programs including its signature Global Social Benefit Incubator (GSBI ), the Center engages an international network of business, investment capital, and technical resources to build the capacity of social enterprises around the world. As a Center of Distinction at Santa Clara University, the Center leverages its programs to inspire faculty and students with real-world case studies, distinctive curricula, and unique research opportunities, advancing the University's vision of creating a more just, humane, and sustainable world.

CAMPUS The University is located on a 106-acre campus in the city of Santa Clara near the south- ern end of the San Francisco Bay in one of the world's great cultural centers and in the heart of the Silicon Valley. At the campus center is the Mission Church, restored in 1928 and surrounded by the roses and palm and olive trees of the historic Mission Gardens. The adjacent Adobe Lodge is the oldest building on campus, having been restored in 1981 to its 1822 decor. There are more than 50 buildings on campus housing 15 student residences, a main library and a law library, two student centers, the de Saisset Museum, SCU Presents, extensive athletic facilities, and a recreation and fitness center. Computer and telecommu-nications technology is an integral part of the life and learning at Santa Clara University. All residence hall rooms and most classrooms are connected to high-speed Internet access and campus email, and most of the campus is covered by a wireless network. The Joanne E. Harrington Learning Commons, Sobrato Family Technology Center, and Orradre Library, which opened in 2008, provides facilities for both individual and group study in an inviting, light-filled, and open environment. The building contains both wired and wireless networks throughout the facility, and two third-floor terraces provide outdoor workspaces with a view. At the help desk on the first floor, librarians provide assis-tance in identifying, evaluating, and retrieving information, and Information Technology (IT) staff provide tech support for basic issues and referrals to the IT Service Center on the third floor for more complicated issues. A notable feature of the building is the Automated Retrieval System (ARS), a high-density storage area where up to 900,000 volumes can be stored by size in more than 11,000 bins and retrieved using robotic-assisted technology. The ARS can be viewed by the public from both inside the building (from a second-floor view - ing area) and outside the building (from the south side). Other features of the building include the two-level Information Commons; over 25 group study rooms; a multimedia lab; several drop-in computer labs; the Saint Clare Room, which can be used for quiet study, small lectures, book events, and other public gatherings; the Department of Archives & Special Collections, which houses the University's significant collections of rare books and manuscripts; and the third floor gallery, which features a regular schedule of exhibits. The Robert F . Benson Memorial Center serves as the hub of campus life. The Benson Center is the home for a variety of services for students, faculty, staff, alumni, and guests of the University and provides an environment for the education of the whole person that continues outside the classroom. The Benson Center offers dining services, houses the cam - pus bookstore and the campus post office, and provides meeting rooms and assistance with event planning. Offices of undergraduate student publications, the Multicultural Center, the Learning Resources Center, and the Writing Center are located in the Benson Center.SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY 7 The Paul L. Locatelli, S.J., Student Activity Center is home to the student government office, the student programming board, student volunteer service, and the Center for Student Leadership. The first new building in more than 40 years designed specifically with student activities in mind, the Locatelli Student Activity Center includes a 6,000 square- foot gathering hall with a high ceiling that can accommodate dances, concerts, as well as pre- and post-game activities. Designed with environmental sensitivity, the new building is energy efficient and has daytime lighting controls and motion sensors to maximize use of natural light. The de Saisset Museum is an art and history museum that supports Santa Clara University's goal of educating the whole person through a diverse range of accessible exhibitions, collec - tions, publications, and educational programs that highlight the art and history of the San Francisco Bay Area and the local Santa Clara Valley. The museum presents six to twelve temporary exhibitions every year. Exhibitions at the de Saisset highlight the diversity of our community, addr ess the issues of contemporary society, showcase the work of under- recognized and under-appreciated artists, and emphasize the strengths of our permanent collection. The museum also serves as the caretaker of the University's California History Collection, which is on permanent view in the galleries. Opportunities are available for undergraduate students to serve as museum docents. SCU Presents includes the Louis B. Mayer Theatre, the Fess Parker Studio Theatre, and the Music Recital Hall. Mayer Theatre is Santa Clara University's premier theatrical venue, housing 500 intimate seats in either a flexible proscenium or thrust stage setting. The Fess Parker Studio Theatre has no fixed stage or seating and with its black-box design, complete with movable catwalks, provides superb flexibility in an experimental setting. The 250-seat Music Recital Hall provides a contemporary setting where students, faculty, and guest artists offer a variety of performances. The Pat Malley Fitness and Recreation Center features a 9,500-square-foot weight train- ing and cardiovascular exercise room, three basketball courts, a swimming pool, and other facilities to support the recreational and fitness needs of the campus community. The University's intercollegiate athletic teams compete in the Leavey Center, Sullivan Aquatic Center, Stephen Schott Stadium, Buck Shaw Stadium, Degheri Tennis Center, and Marsalli Park.82 The Santa Clara Undergraduate Program Santa Clara University is committed to the education of the whole person in the Jesuit and Catholic tradition with a vision of developing men and women to be leaders of compe - tence, conscience, and compassion. The Santa Clara undergraduate program is designed for students who seek an integrated education with a strong humanistic orientation in a pri - marily residential setting. An integrated education is one that encourages students to seek connections between differing ways of knowing and being in the world, between different forms of knowledge within established disciplines, and between new knowledge and that which preceded it. Santa Clara's concept of the \"whole person\" inevitably embraces our social nature. When he inaugurated Santa Clara's sesquicentennial year, Father Peter-Hans Kolvenbach, then superior general of the Society of Jesus, noted that \"Tomorrow's 'whole person' cannot be whole without an educated awareness of society and culture with which to contribute socially, generously, in the real world.\" Calling for a new Jesuit educational standard, \"to educate the whole person of solidarity in the real world,\" he explained: \"Students, in the course of their formation, must let the gritty reality of this world into their lives, so they can learn to feel it, think about it critically, respond to its suffering, and engage in it construc - tively. They should learn to perceive, think, judge, choose, and act for the rights of others, especially the disadvantaged and the oppressed.\" The Santa Clara undergraduate program offers a curriculum and other learning experi - ences whose content and pattern combine the acquisition and creation of knowledge with the quest for meaning and purpose. The learning environment encourages students to make connections across the Core Curriculum, the academic major and elective courses. It helps students relate their classroom learning with out-of-classroom learning through commu-nity-based education, Residential Learning Communities, student organizations, athletics and recreation, and other experiences. In a more general way, the undergraduate program nurtures students' ability to knit the intellectual, social, moral, spiritual, creative, and behav - ioral aspects of life into a coherent and meaningful whole. Santa Clara University offers undergraduate degrees leading to the bachelor of arts, bach - elor of science, and bachelor of science in commerce with majors in 50 fields. The College of Arts and Sciences offers majors in ancient studies, anthropology, art history, biochemis - try, biology, chemistry, classical languages and literatures (Greek and/or Latin), classical studies, communication, computer science, economics, engineering physics, English, envi - ronmental science, environmental studies, ethnic studies, French and Francophone studies, German studies, history, individual studies, Italian studies, liberal studies, mathematics, music, philosophy, physics, political science, psychology, public health science, religious studies, sociology, Spanish studies, studio art, theatre arts, and women's and gender studies. The college also houses the graduate program in pastoral ministries, through which it offers the master of arts degree in catechetics, pastoral liturgy, spirituality, and liturgical music. THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM 9 The Leavey School of Business offers majors in accounting, accounting and information systems, economics, finance, management, marketing, and operations management and information systems. The School of Engineering offers majors in bioengineering, civil engi - neering, computer science and engineering, electrical engineering, general engineering, mechanical engineering, and Web design and engineering. A wide range of departmental and school minors, emphases in majors, and concentra - tions in degree programs are available to enhance the major field of study for students. Consistent with the commitment to an integrated educational experience, interdisciplinary minors are offered in Arabic, Islamic, and Middle Eastern studies; Asian studies; medieval and Renaissance studies; musical theatre; retail studies; science, technology, and society; and urban education. THE SANTA CLARA CORE CURRICULUM A university expresses its most basic values in its Core Curriculum that is part of an undergraduate education required of all students. Santa Clara's Core Curriculum explicitly integrates three traditions of higher education. As a Catholic university, it is rooted in the tradition of pursuing an understanding of God through the free exercise of reason. As a Jesuit university, it promotes a humanistic education that leads toward an ethical engagement with the world. As a comprehensive American university committed to liberal education, Santa Clara seeks to prepare its students for intelligent, responsible, and creative citizenship. Reflecting these traditions, the Core Curriculum provides every undergraduate with the common learning that all students need to become leaders of competence, conscience, and compassion. The distinctiveness of a Santa Clara education emerges in the Core Curriculum, both in its sense of purpose rooted in the University's traditions and in its commitment to a breadth of learning that complements and supports all majors. The Core Curriculum opens students to the study and practice of the arts, humanities, mathematics, technology, natural sciences, and social sciences. It educates students for ethically informed participation in civic life. Opportunities for experiential learning foster the development of compassion and atten- tion to the ways human suffering can be alleviated. Reflecting the University's founding mission, the Core Curriculum includes a disciplined and critical reflection on the religious dimensions of human existence. In addition, because the Core Curriculum continually highlights the critical and compelling questions facing individuals and communities, the Core Curriculum supports students both in making professional career choices and in discerning their larger vocation\u2014their life's purpose in the world. Learning Goals: What will students learn in the Core Curriculum? Because a liberal education in the Jesuit tradition is oriented toward particular ends, the Core Curriculum affirms a set of central learning goals. These goals are divided among three broad categories\u2014Knowledge, Habits of Mind and Heart, and Engagement with the World. Knowledge To be prepared for well-informed engagement in society, students must comprehend the forces that have shaped the world they have inherited and the ways the world is interpreted and understood. They must also understand how they might transform the world for the better. The Core Curriculum deepens students' knowledge of the ideas and ways of knowing that emerge from the arts, humanities, and natural and social sciences.10 THE SANTA CL ARA UNDERGRADUATE PR OGRAM Global Cultures: The intertwined development of global ideas, institutions, religions, and cultures, including Western cultures Arts and Humanities : The production, interpretation, and social influence of the fine and performing arts, history, languages, literatures, philosophy, and religion Scientific Inquiry : The principles of scientific inquiry and how they are applied in the natural and social sciences Science and Technology: The formative influences, dynamics, social impacts, and ethical consequences of scientific and technological development Diversity: Diverse human experiences, identities, and cultures within local and global societies, especially as formed by relations of power and privilege Civic Life: The roles, rights, and responsibilities of citizens and institutions in societies and in the world Habits of Mind and Heart To contribute to a rapidly changing, complex, and interdependent world, students must develop ways of thinking, feeling, and acting that allow them to educate themselves for the rest of their lives with passion and purpose. By attending to the cognitive and affective dimensions of human experience, the Core Curriculum enables students to think more deeply, imagine more freely, and communicate more clearly. Critical Thinking: The ability to identify, reflect upon, evaluate, integrate, and apply different types of information and knowledge to form independent judgments Mathematics and Quantitative Reasoning: Analytical and logical thinking and the habit of drawing conclusions based on quantitative information Complexity: An approach to understanding the world that appreciates ambiguity and nuance as well as clarity and precision Ethical Reasoning: Drawing on ethical traditions to assess the consequences of indi - vidual and institutional decisions Religious Reflection: Questioning and clarifying beliefs through critical inquiry into faith and the religious dimensions of human existence Communication: Interacting effectively with different audiences, especially through writing, speech, and a second language Engagement with the World To engage with the world in meaningful ways, students need opportunities to explore and refine self-knowledge in relation to others. The Core Curriculum enhances students' understanding of the integrity of their own lives and the dignity inherent in the lives of others, especially the impoverished, suffering, and marginalized. Perspective: Seeking out the experience of different cultures and people, striving to view the world through their eyes Collaboration: The capacity to collaborate intellectually and creatively with diverse people Social Justice: Developing a disciplined sensibility toward the causes of human suffering and misery, and a sense of responsibility for addressing them Civic Engagement: Addressing major contemporary social issues, including environ- mental sustainability and peaceful resolution of conflict, by participating actively as an informed citizen of society and the worldTHE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM 11 The Curriculum: What courses will students take in the Core Curriculum? Each course in the Core Curriculum addresses at least three of the learning goals listed above. Students have multiple opportunities to encounter, practice, and master each learn - ing goal. In addition, specific learning objectives for each area of the Core Curriculum have been developed by faculty Core Curriculum committees. These learning objectives are asso - ciated with particular learning goals and describe the knowledge, skills, and values students will be able to demonstrate after completing the courses in the Core Curriculum. The learn - ing objectives are posted on the Core Curriculum website and published annually in the Core Curriculum Guide. The structure of the Core features two phases of coursework designed to foster develop - mental learning and curricular coherence. The first phase, Foundations, consists of courses normally taken in the first year, introducing students to the processes and expectations for university-level education: Critical Thinking & Writing (CTW), Cultures & Ideas (C&I), a second language, mathematics, and the first course in the Religion, Theology & Culture (RTC) sequence. This phase helps students begin to set their own goals for learn - ing, preparing them to make thoughtful choices in the Core Curriculum, their majors, and co-curricular activities. The second phase, Explorations, includes courses that expand students' understanding of a broad range of knowledge and abilities needed for effective participation in contempo - rary life. Each student will take courses in ethics, civic engagement, diversity, arts, social science, natural science, and science, technology, and society, and they will take additional courses in the Cultures & Ideas and Religion, Theology & Culture sequences. Many Explorations courses overlap with courses in students' majors. The Core Curriculum also includes Integrations that help students make connections among courses in the Core Curriculum and between the Core Curriculum and their majors. Integrations usually are not additional courses. Rather, they are components of other courses. One Integrations course includes an experiential learning element oriented toward issues of social justice. One course involves an advanced writing component. Students also link a set of Core Curriculum, major, and/or elective courses into an interdisciplinary Pathway. Pathways foster integrative, intentional learning, providing opportunities for undergraduate research, complementing the majors, and encouraging the application of knowledge in the world. Pathways focus on a wide range of themes including American studies; applied ethics; beauty; children, family, and society; cinema studies; democracy; design thinking; the digital age; food, hunger, poverty, and the environment; gender, global - ization, and empire; gender, sexuality, and the body; global health; human rights in a global world; Islamic studies; justice and the arts; law and social justice; leading people, organiza - tions, and social change; paradigm shifts; politics and religion; public policy; race, place, and social inequalities; sustainability; values in science and technology; and vocation. Student progress through the structure of the Core Curriculum is not strictly sequential, from Foundations through Explorations to Integrations. While some courses (e.g., Critical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2; Cultures & Ideas 1, 2, and 3; and Religion, Theology & Culture 1, 2, and 3) must be taken in sequence, all students have the opportunity to discover other sequences that are best for their individual undergraduate experience. At the same time, all students engage in coursework designed to help them achieve the shared set of learning objectives for each component of the Core Curriculum. Furthermore, the Experiential Learning for Social Justice, Advanced Writing, and Pathways components of the Core Curriculum help students experience requirements not only as individual courses but as related educational activities that help structure and integrate their entire experience of university study.12 THE SANTA CL ARA UNDERGRADUATE PR OGRAM The 2013-14 Core Curriculum Guide provides more detailed information about each component of the Core Curriculum, the learning goals and objectives associated with each component, and the courses from which students may choose. An online version is available at www.scu.edu/core. The Core Curriculum and the College of Arts and Sciences Students in the College of Arts and Sciences should consult Chapter 3 for the require - ments for their majors. There are no additional college-wide requirements beyond the requirements for the Undergraduate Core Curriculum. The Core Curriculum and the Leavey School of Business Leavey School of Business requirements determine how students in the business school satisfy some Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements\u2014some Core Curriculum requirements must be fulfilled with specific courses. Students in the Leavey School of Business should consult Chapter 4 for the complete list of requirements for the majors and the school. The Core Curriculum Guide provides additional information. The Core Curriculum and the School of Engineering Students in the School of Engineering satisfy their mathematics and natural science requirement with courses required by their majors; their second language requirement is met by Santa Clara's entrance requirements. Some sections of Core courses in Diversity, Cultures & Ideas 3, and Religion, Theology & Culture 2 and 3 will allow engineering stu - dents to satisfy two requirements with one course, with the understanding that other coursework for their majors will complete the acquisition of knowledge and skills required in the Core. Engineering students will complete their Pathways with three courses. Core Curriculum Policies A single course may satisfy only one Core requirement with the following exceptions: Some students satisfy some requirements with more than one course, each of which par - tially completes the requirement. Those courses are identified in CourseAvail as \"xxxPAR\" because they \"partially\" fulfill a requirement. Engineering students may satisfy more than one requirement with one course when the course has been approved for those Core require - ments. All students may satisfy major requirements with Core courses when the courses are approved for both the major and the Core. All students may satisfy multiple Integrations requirements with courses that satisfy other Core and major requirements when the courses are approved for the Integrations requirements as well as for the other Core and major requirements. Many courses offered through the study abroad program are pre-approved to fulfill Core Curriculum requirements. Neither the first nor third level Core Curriculum requirement in Religion, Theology & Culture can be fulfilled with a study abroad course. Transfer Credit and the Core Curriculum T wo sets of rules for awarding transfer credit for Core areas are in place, one for students admitted as freshmen and another for transfer students. All students must satisfy the following Core requirements at Santa Clara University: Civic Engagement; Science, Technology & Society; Advanced Writing; Experiential Learning for Social Justice; and Pathways. Students admitted as freshmen must also satisfy Critical Thinking & Writing and Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2 with courses completed at Santa Clara University.THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM 13 In contrast, students admitted as transfers are encouraged to complete these courses before their first quarter at Santa Clara. For transfer students only, transfer credit for Critical Thinking & Writing may include exemptions granted at other schools and credit granted through Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate test scores. Information about possible substitutions for Critical Thinking & Writing and Cultures & Ideas courses is available in the Registrar's Office. T ransfer students who enter the University with fewer than 44 units must take all three Religion, Theology & Culture courses in the required sequence. Students matriculating with 44 or more units of transferable college credit, which does not include any Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate test credit, must complete two courses from any two of the following three categories: Religion, Theology & Culture 1, 2, or 3. T ransfer students must declare their Pathways by the end of their third quarter at SCU. T ransfer students in the College of Arts and Sciences and Leavey School of Business who matriculate with fewer than 44 units must take four courses to fulfill the Pathways require - ment. T ransfer students in the College of Arts and Sciences and Leavey School of Business who matriculate with more than 44 units must take three courses to fulfill the Pathways requirement. All transfer students in the School of Engineering must take three courses to fulfill the Pathways requirement. Students who transfer to Santa Clara University should consult Chapters 7 and 8 as well as the chapters relevant to their school or college. RESIDENTIAL LEARNING COMMUNITIES Residential Learning Communities were established to foster integrated education within a community of scholars. By creating a culture in which students connect their academic experiences with their social and residential ones, the learning communities enhance the education of the whole person and deepen the connection between learning and living as responsible members of a community. All entering first-year students, whether or not they live on campus, become members of one of eight theme-based Residential Learning Communities. Nonresident first-year students are given access to the residence hall in which their learning community is located so that they can participate fully in its programs. Students take at least one Core Foundations sequence in common with others in their learning community, enriching coursework and promoting the formation of study groups. Students also interact directly with faculty and staff and participate in theme-based co-curricular and extracurricular activities both on and off campus. Residential Learning Communities are primarily two-year communities, but some offer the opportunity for students to remain throughout their undergraduate careers. UNIVERSITY HONORS PROGRAM The University Honors Program provides a learning experience appropriate to students of exceptional academic talent and imagination. The program offers small seminar-style classes, especially in courses fulfilling the Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements. Admission to the University Honors Program is by invitation or application and considers the student's academic record, standardized test scores, recommendations, and any other information the student might provide about interests, goals, or experiences. The program is organized as two distinct but related levels open to undergraduate stu- dents from arts and sciences, business, and engineering. Level I of the program accepts first-year students for a curriculum organized around courses that satisfy Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements applying to students in every field. The University Honors 14 THE SANTA CL ARA UNDERGRADUATE PR OGRAM Program requires that all participants maintain a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.3 or higher, and Level I participants must successfully complete a minimum of six pro - gram courses within the first six quarters of enrollment. Most participants complete Level I during their first year. Unless exempted by the director, Level I participants must fulfill specific Foundations courses in the Core Curriculum\u2014Critical Thinking & Writing, Cultures & Ideas, and Religion, Theology & Culture\u2014through special class sections arranged by the program. Participants are also strongly urged to satisfy Core Curriculum requirements such as mathematics, ethics, social sciences, natural sciences, advanced writing, and advanced Religion, Theology & Culture with Honors Program sections. Participants in Level I normally continue to Level II, in which they complete a mini- mum of four additional program courses including a senior thesis or project. Students who have completed 32 or more units but not more than 88 units at Santa Clara may apply to enter Level II by contacting the Honors Program Office. Students joining the program at Level II complete six program courses including the thesis or senior project. Some Level II courses, while not limited to program participants, offer academic opportunities especially suitable for them. For both continuing and new participants, the thesis usually grows out of a regular or independent study course taken in conjunction with the participant's major, minor, or Pathway. Successful completion of the program at Level II becomes part of a student's permanent record and appears on academic transcripts issued by the University. Honors Program students have the opportunity to participate in the Honors Advisory Council. The University Honors Program is allied with the Office of Student Fellowships, which helps prepare students to compete for nationally competitive graduate fellowships such as Rhodes, Marshall, Fulbright, Mitchell, Goldwater, Udall, Jack Kent Cooke, and Gates Cambridge. A competitive annual award permits one Honors Program student to spend his or her junior year at Mansfield College, Oxford University. For information about courses offered through the University Honors Program, see Chapter 6, Interdisciplinary Minors and Other Programs of Study. LEAD SCHOLARS PROGRAM The LEAD (Leadership, Excellence, and Academic Development) Scholars Program provides for selected first-generation University students a smooth transition to life at Santa Clara. Participation in the program is by invitation. LEAD scholars are selected from among those awarded a grant or scholarship by Santa Clara University. The LEAD Scholars Pro - gram forms a community of undergraduate peers and faculty dedicated to rigorous aca - demic achievement and student leadership. LEAD Scholars have the opportunity to participate in the LEAD Council, a leadership group that provides programs, events, and other opportunities to serve the needs of the LEAD community. The program involves sup - port as well as challenge throughout the four years, with a special emphasis on the first-year experience. The LEAD Scholars Program is committed to fostering an atmosphere of successful scholarship, community engagement, and service. Social and academic programs include seminars, academic advising and support, peer mentoring, team building, and outreach to families. All LEAD scholars participate in LEAD Week, which is scheduled for the week immediately preceding the beginning of the fall term.THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM 15 STUDY ABROAD Santa Clara University aspires to create a learning community that promotes compe - tence, conscience, and compassion among students with a mandate to pursue scholarly understanding and constructive engagement with the world. The Study Abroad Program mission is inspired by the challenge offered by martyred Salvadoran Jesuit Ignacio Ellacuria: We, as an intellectual community, must analyze causes; use imagination and creativity together to discover remedies; communicate to our public a consciousness that inspires the freedom of self-determination; educate professionals with a conscience, who will be immediate instruments of transformation; and continually hone an educational institute that is academically excellent and ethically oriented. Undergraduate students can choose from a variety of study abroad programs in over 50 locations. Credits earned from all approved study abroad programs are accepted as degree credit at Santa Clara, and can fulfill, major, and minor requirements with the approval of the chairperson of the department, or Core with the approval of the Associate Provost for Undergraduate Studies. Courses offered through Study Abroad can be found in Chapter 6 under Interdisciplinary Minors and Other Programs of Study. DOMESTIC PUBLIC SECTOR STUDIES PROGRAMS The Public Sector Studies Program at Santa Clara University offers an introduction to the areas traditionally known as public policy, public administration, public affairs, and urban planning. It is designed to provide a closer look at the creation, implementation, and analysis of public policies, and the operation of government, public, and nonprofit organi - zations. The program also provides an excellent foundation for those who would like to pursue graduate studies in public policy or public administration and an alternative perspective for students who wish to pursue public law. Opportunities for Firsthand Study Through the Public Sector Studies program in the Department of Political Science, students have the opportunity to participate in public sector internships, the Washington Semester Program, and the Panetta Institute's Congressional Internship program. These programs offer preparation and training for students interested in working at the city, county, state, or federal level of government, in a public agency or nonprofit organization, or considering graduate-level studies in related fields. Internships Perhaps the best way to understand is by doing\u2014students participating in public sector internships not only observe what happens in the \"real world,\" but they are able to take part as well, gaining invaluable experience and knowledge. Placements in public sector intern - ships have included the San Jose mayor's and City Council members' offices, district offices of members of Congress and the California Legislature, government relations departments of high-tech corporations, public law offices including the Santa Clara county Public Defender and District Attorney, political campaigns, and nonprofit organizations. Many students end their internships with excellent employment prospects.16 THE SANTA CL ARA UNDERGRADUATE PR OGRAM The Washington Semester Program In the Washington Semester Program, students combine coursework taken at American University with hands-on experience via internships. In the past, SCU students have interned at the White House, the Justice Department, the FBI, interest groups, broadcast news stations, various nonprofit organizations, and offices of members of the U.S. House of Representatives. The Washington Semester Program offers students the opportunity to live, study, and work in our nation's capital for one semester along with students from other U.S. states and from countries abroad. Numerous programs of study are available, including American Politics, Public Law, U.S. Foreign Policy, International Environment and Development, Economic Policy, Journalism, International Business and T rade, Peace and Conflict Resolution, and Contemporary Islam. Several programs include a three-week international travel component along with study in Washington. Students participating in the Washington Semester Program earn 22.5 to 24 quarter credits for one semester of study. Grades and units received at American University will count toward the student's SCU grade point average and course requirements for the department and the University when appropriate. The Panetta Institute's Congressional Internship Program The Leon and Sylvia Panetta Institute for Public Policy at California State University\u2014 Monterey Bay, founded by Santa Clara political science alumnus Leon Panetta, offers an opportunity for students to gain an inside look at the legislative branch of the U.S. federal government and Washington politics. This Congressional internship begins with a two-week course at California State University\u2014Monterey Bay, where students work directly with seasoned veterans examining the legislative process and its functions. The remaining two-and-a-half months of the internship are spent in Washington, D.C. working on Capitol Hill in the office of a member of the California Congressional delegation. One exceptional Santa Clara University student is chosen each year for this fully subsidized internship. Eligibility To be eligible to participate in one of these Public Sector Studies Programs, students must have completed at least 88 quarter units of credit by the date that the program of study begins, must not be on academic or disciplinary probation, and must be in good financial standing with the University. Students must also meet grade point average and other eligi-bility requirements for the specific program.

Atom Yee Associate Deans: Barbara M. Fraser, Carol Ann Gittens, Stephen C. Lee Senior Assistant Dean: Kathleen Villarruel SchneiderAssistant Dean: Rafael D. Ulate The goals of the College of Arts and Sciences are to foster a learning community com - mitted to addressing the fundamental problems of society with a spirit of inquiry, mutual respect, and intellectual excitement and to prepare students to understand and appreciate a broad range of peoples and cultures so they may exercise moral leadership in a pluralistic world. In this way, the College is central to Santa Clara's Jesuit, liberal education. With more than 1,500 courses in the humanities, arts, social sciences, and natural sciences, the College offers an inclusive and welcoming academic environment providing: A common educational experience for all undergraduate students through the University's Core Curriculum Majors in 37 subject areas Departmental and interdisciplinary minor programs Opportunities for advanced study in a student's particular area of interest All undergraduate students at the University explore the sciences and liberal arts through the University's Core Curriculum that challenges them to develop open and critical think-ing, to communicate effectively, to work with complex methods of inquiry, to understand diverse cultures and peoples, and to appreciate the demands of ethical decision making. Those who select majors or minors in the College have the opportunity to develop special - ized knowledge and skills in areas of concentration that reflect their personal interests and talents. Students are encouraged to use elective courses to pursue particular interests beyond their chosen major. In addition to selecting individual courses, students have the opportu-nity to organize their electives around minors and emphases in many departmental and interdisciplinary programs throughout the College. The College of Arts and Sciences offers a variety of student-faculty research opportuni - ties and ongoing mentoring relationships in which students work closely with faculty mem - bers in the creation of knowledge or original artistic works. These opportunities include research assistantships throughout the College in the arts, humanities, and natural and social sciences.18 COLLEGE OF ART S AND SCIENCES UNDERGRADUATE DEGREES The College of Arts and Sciences confers the degree of bachelor of arts in ancient studies, art history, chemistry, classical languages and literatures (Greek and/or Latin), classical stud - ies, communication, English, French and Francophone studies, German studies, history, individual studies, Italian studies, music, philosophy, religious studies, Spanish studies, studio art, and theatre arts.

Descriptions of the interdisciplinary minors and the associated requirements are provided in Chapter 6, Interdisciplinary Minors and Other Programs of Study.UNDERGRADUATE DEGREES 19 CENTERS, INSTITUTES, AND SPECIAL PROGRAMS SCU Presents SCU Presents consists of Santa Clara University students, faculty, and staff working in music, theatre, and dance who, with the resources of their academic departments, serve the University and local community by providing a rich season of performance events. Promoting the performing arts through a variety of programs, SCU Presents encourages the interdisci- plinary exploration of performance as a way of encountering, knowing, and acting in the world. SCU Presents also encourages and supports the creative expression of Silicon Valley artists by providing performance space for local arts organizations. SCU Presents, also produces a Santa Clara University Visiting Artist Series of national and international artist. The Future Teachers Project The Future Teachers Project (FTP), formerly known as the Eastside Future Teachers Project, works with students from traditionally underrepresented groups throughout Silicon Valley and the greater Bay Area who are interested in becoming teachers. Through innovative outreach and support programs, the goal is to develop leaders who will make an immediate impact on their communities. FTP scholars are generally recruited during high school and once at SCU are considered for the FTP scholarship, which contributes to undergraduate studies and the credential program. The FTP is administered by the Liberal Studies Program.20 COLLEGE OF ART S AND SCIENCES DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY Professor Emeritus: George D. Westermark Professors: Mary Elaine Hegland, S. Gullette, Laura E. Hauff, Lee Panich The Department of Anthropology offers a degree program leading to the bachelor of science in anthropology. A solid undergraduate foundation in anthropology secures the analytical skills needed to undertake professional degrees in anthropology, business, law, public health, social services, or provides a foundation for embarking on a number of other professional careers. The department also offers a minor, several emphases, and an honors thesis option. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling the Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of science degree, students majoring in anthropology must complete the following departmental requirements: ANTH 1, 2, 3 SOCI 1 ANTH 50 or ENVS 50 or POLI 50 ANTH 110, 112, 114, 198 Five upper-division courses selected from the following four categories: biological (ANTH regional (ANTH 180-189). At least three of the four categories must be represented in the student's selection. An introductory statistics course Six anthropology seminars Emphasis Programs in Anthropology Anthropology majors have the option of completing a special emphasis program to complement their majors. The emphasis is not a narrow specialization but reflects compe - tence in the subfields of the discipline. Completion of a special emphasis program will be noted on student transcripts with the approval of the department chair. The emphasis in applied anthropology prepares students to use anthropological knowl- edge to address pressing human problems in careers outside the University. Through course-work and related internships, students will gain a better understanding of how anthropological knowledge and skills can be used in occupations related to health and medicine, interna-tional development, environment, government, business, education, immigration, and pov - erty. The emphasis in archaeology focuses on a deeper understanding of the human past and how it is studied. This is a possible course of study for majors with an interest in employ - ment in cultural resource management or graduate study in archaeology. The emphasis in biological provides in-depth training in the field of biological anthropology. Students will acquire a strong understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of anthropology and the biological and cultural interactions that have influenced human evolution and diversity.

Morris, Andrea Pappas Assistant Professors: Karen Fraser, Takeshi Moro, Ryan Reynolds, Tobias Woffor d Senior Lecturers: Francisco \"Pancho\" Jimenez, Marco MarquezLecturers: Renee Billingslea, Julie Hughes The Department of Art and Art History offers a degree program leading to the bachelor of arts in two undergraduate majors, art history and studio art, with courses in both disci - plines fostering a thorough understanding of the history and practice of art. Department faculty encourage interdisciplinary connections with the Santa Clara com - munity through course offerings that fulfill a wide range of College and Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements, as well as courses through the University Honors Program. ART HISTORY The art history major at Santa Clara is distinguished by excellent teaching and mentor - ing, challenging coursework, and opportunities for study abroad, peer educating, and stu - dent internships at local and Bay Area institutions. Moreover, we support, in conjunction with our fully accredited campus museum, Explore with Me, a docent-training program for our students. Advanced art history majors are encouraged to participate in our annual Art History Symposium and the Art History Research Paper Competition. The art history major features numerous opportunities for personal and professional growth to better understand the meanings and purposes of the visual arts, including its historic develop - ment, roles in society, and relationships to other fields in the humanities. Students learn to think critically and communicate clearly about works of art. The art history major develops the following skills: knowledge acquisition, critical thinking, analysis of visual and textual sources, advanced research and writing skills, and sophisticated oral presentations. These intellectual skills enable art history majors to pursue a diversity of interests in a wide spec - trum of fields and professions, including graduate work in art history. STUDIO ART Studio art majors develop comprehensive skills that help prepare them for graduate study or careers in either the fine or commercial arts. Faculty members emphasize the devel - opment of conceptual and technical competence, as well as critical analysis of the student's own work and that of others. By graduation, every student develops a body of original art - work to be exhibited in a senior show in the department gallery. Students are required to articulate an artist's statement reflecting their own engagement with the creative process, in conjunction with their senior show. Studio art majors take three sections of art history and are encouraged to take one or more courses in 20th-century or contemporary art. The studio seminar is highly recom-mended for all studio art majors and should be taken in the third year when possible. At the end of each year, students are encouraged to submit their work to the Annual Student Art Exhibit, which is judged by an outside professional in the field of art. The department also oversees merit-based scholarships, which are usually given to outstanding students with junior status.28 COLLEGE OF ART S AND SCIENCES REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJORS In addition to fulfilling the Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bach - elor of arts degree, students majoring in art history (ARTH) or studio art (ARTS) must complete the following departmental requirements: Major in Art History Students must complete 15 courses (13 ARTH and 2 ARTS): Four courses selected from the 20-series (ARTH 21-27) ARTH 100 (preferably at the end of sophomore year) ARTH 196 (capstone seminar) is required in senior year T wo lower- or upper-division ARTS courses Five upper-division ARTH courses (no more than three may be taken abroad) T wo additional lower- or upper-division ARTH courses Note: Only 4 units of ARTH 98/198 may count toward the major.

Pfeiffer Professors: Michael R. Carrasco (Department Chair), John C. Gilbert, Patrick E. Hoggard ( Fletcher Jones Professor), Dennis C. Jacobs, W. Atom Yee Associate Professors: Linda S. Brunauer, Brian J. McNelis, Amy M. Senior Lecturer: Steven L. FedderLecturers: Geoffrey Dafforn, Stephen Reaney The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry offers three baccalaureate degrees: the bachelor of science in chemistry, the bachelor of science in biochemistry, and the bachelor of arts in chemistry. The curriculum is accredited by the American Chemical Society (ACS), the professional organization for chemistry. The program prepares students for further work in chemistry or biochemistry, either in graduate school or as professional chemists. In addi - tion, a chemistry or biochemistry degree is excellent preparation for careers in medicine, dentistry, law, engineering, business, and teaching. A minor in chemistry is also available. All bachelor of science degrees provide graduates with the background necessary to begin a career in chemistry or biochemistry at industrial and governmental laboratories, for admis-sion to institutions offering graduate degrees in chemistry and biochemistry, and for admission to medical and dental schools as well as other professional programs in the health profes - sions. The chemistry major provides equal training in all the disciplines in chemistry, and the biochemistry major combines training in chemistry with additional coursework in cell and molecular biology. The bachelor of science-ACS certified degrees meet all recom - mended standards for chemists and biochemists as mandated by the ACS. The bachelor of arts degree allows students the most freedom in choosing electives, and therefore is an excellent program for pre-medical or pre-teaching students. Students with a strong interest in the liberal arts or who wish to pursue subjects outside the standard science curriculum will benefit from this degree. The bachelor of arts degree can be effectively com - bined with a pre-law or business curriculum to provide excellent preparation for law or business careers in the technology sector. Undergraduate research is a critical component of our degrees and most of our majors conduct research in collaboration with faculty mentors. Research in the department has been funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund, the Dreyfus Foundation, and the Research Corporation. Majors in chemistry, bio - chemistry, biology, and public health science participate in faculty research projects through CHEM 182, 183, and 184. In addition, advanced students have opportunities for part-time employment assisting faculty in laboratory and related teaching activities.

Dodson, Emile McAnany Professors: Soukup Associate Professors: Christine M. Bachen, Hsin-I Cheng, Stephen C. Lee, Yahia Mahamdi, Chad Raphael, Katherine Heintz, Andrew W. Ishak The Department of Communication offers a program of studies leading to a bachelor of arts in communication. The major prepares students for a wide variety of graduate studies and for careers in the communication industry. An academic minor is also available. Students explore the theories, research methods, responsibilities, institutional structures, and effects of mass communication, interpersonal communication, and computer-mediated commu - nication. The major also integrates theory with practice. We help students to apply their knowledge of the communication process to create their own speeches, films, television programs, journalism, Web content, and communication and marketing campaigns. Many of our students go directly to work in these fields after graduation. Because the communication field requires students to have a broad liberal arts education, students integrate courses in the Department of Communication with courses in other departments. Often, students complete a minor or take a number of courses in related dis-ciplines. To encourage students to explore global studies, the department accepts up to two approved study abroad courses toward completion of the communication course require - ments, usually as upper-division electives. All junior and senior students are encouraged to complete an internship at an off-campus media organization or other communication-related institution. Internships may be counted for course credit as a department elective. In their senior years, all communication majors synthesize their learning in the depart - ment by completing a scholarly thesis or an applied capstone project in journalism, digital filmmaking, or public relations. Theses and capstone projects, which typically embody students' most advanced work, are suitable for submission as part of applications for gradu - ate school and jobs. Students interested in communication, including nonmajors, enjoy a wealth of co- curricular opportunities. All students are encouraged to participate in one of the student-run campus media, including the student newspaper, radio station, and yearbook. Practicum courses allow students to gain academic credit for working in student media. Santa Clara Debate, one of the oldest forensic programs in continuous operation on the West Coast, provides a challenging and rigorous co-curricular activity designed to develop public speak - ing skills, critical thinking, and public policy analysis. Policy debate participants are eligible to apply for merit scholarships. All courses taken to fulfill requirements for the major or minor must be four or five units and must be taken for a letter grade, not on a pass/no pass basis. Practicum courses, numbered 190 through 195, do not count toward fulfillment of the communication major or minor.68 COLLEGE OF ART S AND SCIENCES REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of arts degree, students majoring in communication must complete the following depart - mental requirements: COMM 1 COMM 2 or 2GL 30 COMM 40 or 40EL T wo upper-division communication theory courses (signified by the letter \"A\" in the course number) One upper-division communication applied course (signified by the letter \"B\" in the course number) T wo additional approved elective upper-division communication courses COMM 110 COMM 111 or 111G COMM 196 or 197 REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR Students must fulfill the following requirements for a minor in communication: COMM 1 or 2 T wo approved upper-division communication courses Three additional approved communication courses (any combination of upper-division or lower-division courses) LOWER-DIVISION COURSES 1.

Field (Department Chair and Michel and Mary Orradre Professor), John M. Heineke, Kris J. Mitchener ( Robert and Susan Finocchio Linda Kamas, Ardelean As one of the social sciences, economics studies how the choices we make as individu - als\u2014as consumers and producers, as savers and investors, as managers and employees, as citizens and voters\u2014combine to determine how society uses its scarce resources to produce and distribute goods and services. This practical, useful discipline provides insights into important issues such as the determinants of wealth and poverty; unemployment, inflation, international trade, and economic growth; and success and failure in the marketplace. The rigorous, systematic analysis that the study of economics brings to bear on these and other real-world issues provides excellent preparation for careers in both the private and the public sectors, as well as for graduate study in economics, business, public policy, and law. Eco-nomics graduates pursue varied careers in business, law, banking and finance, government service, education, and private consulting. Students considering graduate study in econom - ics leading to a master's or doctoral degree are strongly encouraged to meet with their advisor as early as possible to plan an appropriate course of study.

(1-5 units) NCXETHNIC STUDIES 113 ETHNIC STUDIES PROGRAM Associate Professors: Ram\u00f3n D. Chac\u00f3n, James S. Lai (Program Director), Anna Sampaio Assistant Professor: Anthony Hazard The Ethnic Studies Program provides a critical analysis of historical and contemporary formations of race, ethnicity, class, and gender. In the pursuit of social justice, it challenges dominant views of racial and ethnic groups that lead to inequalities. Ethnic studies focuses on the roles and experiences of African Americans, Asian/Pacific Islander Americans, Latinas/Latinos, and Native Americans within the framework of the United States and within trans-national frameworks. As an academic program, ethnic studies fosters interdisciplinary inquiry. The faculty comprise a community of expert scholars of critical race and ethnic studies, while serving as teachers, mentors, and role models for undergraduate students. Ethnic studies strives to make connections between University learning, racial and ethnic communities, and social change, and encourages a reflective engagement with society and a commitment to fashion - ing a more humane and just world. The Ethnic Studies Program serves as a resource for students, faculty, and staff across the University who are interested in examining race and ethnicity and its intersections with class, gender, citizenship, and nationality. The program offers both a companion major and a minor in ethnic studies: a student must declare a primary major in another discipline as well as companion major in ethnic studies. The companion major is designed to complement a student's primary major by broadening the field of study to include an academic focus on race/ethnicity.

African-American Independent Filmmakers This class provides an in-depth analysis and historical overview of independent African-American filmmakers who made significant contributions to the genre of film. We will examine how African-American filmmakers used film as a medium to heighten the con - sciousness of their audience, combat nega-tive stereotypes, give voice to marginalized or underrepresented groups, and raise social awareness about issues affecting their diverse communities. Using film and text, we will read, discuss, and write about paradigms that lead to inequity and injustice. Specifi - cally, we will examine the intersection of gender, race, and class, and note how these dynamics are illustrated in the cinema of Af - rican Americans. We will also understand how African-American filmmakers were able to rise above adversity, and hone and sustain their art, while confronting their myriad op-pressions. (4 units) 96. Race, Class, and Culture through Film Explores how filmmakers who are concerned about racism portray the politics, history, and culture of people of African descent. Ex - amines how this medium can humanize sub - jects who are often objectified and exploited and give voice to communities whose per-spectives and opinions have been historically excluded from mainstream discourses. Con - siders how films can interrogate the physical, ETHNIC STUDIES 117 cultural, and sometimes, psychological bru - tality of racist practices, as well as the ways that racism intersects with other forms of marginalization related to class, gender, sex - uality, and citizenship. The content, produc - tion, and distribution of these cinematic portraits illuminate the political philoso -phies, hybrid cultures, and emancipating collective action of black communities. Inte - grates students in faculty research by involv-ing students in a documentary film project about the relationship between the social movements for African liberation and black power. (4 units) UPPER-DIVISION COURSES 112.

Latina/o Immigr ant Detention and Incorporation in the Age of T errorism This class will examine shifts in immigration politics with specific focus on the largest population of immigrants in the U.S., namely Latinas/os. In the course of this ex - amination, we will pay particular attention to changes occurring after 1996 and the in - creasing scrutiny of both documented and undocumented immigrants that has led to surges in the numbers of immigrants de-tained, apprehended, incarcerated, and de-ported. We will be mindful of the gendered, class, and racialized dynamics at work in the development and execution of new immi-118 COLLEGE OF ART S AND SCIENCES gration policy, and we will examine the effect of these shifts on concepts of citizenship. In the end, the course will compel students to consider the moral, political, and legal impli - cations of an immigration policy focused disproportionately on enforcement and challenge them to find comprehensive alter - natives. (5 units) 129. Mexican Popular Catholicism and Gender From the perspective of the sociology of reli-gion, this course contextualizes the lives of Chicanas/Mexicanas in Mexican popular Catholic tradition, practices, and belief sys-tem with particular attention to race, class, gender, and sexuality. This course repositions feminist analysis from a brief acknowledge-ment of the influence of Mexican popular Catholicism in the lives of Chicanas/Mexi - canas to a much more encompassing critical analysis of exactly how Catholicism influ-ences women's everyday experiences. Through the use of case studies and second - ary research, students will explore the cre - ative and complex ways Chicanas/Mexicanas participate in the workforce, in politics, in public life, and at home as people of faith.

Musical exam - ples and video documentaries will be used in conjunction with class lectures, discussion, and presentations by guest artists. (5 units) 134. Black Social Movements Black social movements consistently chal - lenge the marginalization of communities of African descent. In the process of contesting the legitimacy and consequences of physical terror, economic exploitation, and cultural misappropriation endured by their commu - nities, social movements throughout the African diaspora have created many of the philosophies, repertoires of collective action, and aesthetic traditions that lay at the core of our understanding, and imagination, of black life and political dissent. Students will closely examine the work of two historical social movements in the African diaspora\u2014Black Power and African Liberation\u2014which envisioned freedom, justice, and self-deter - mination for black communities. Students will learn about the ideas, tactics, and lega - cies of these movements by conducting in - terviews with Black Power and African Liberation activists. In addition, students will evaluate the work of black social move - ments that are currently organizing in their communities. Through research, readings, and class discussions, students will interro-gate both the iconography and vilification of black social movements and their impact on race and politics in the present day. (5 units) 135. African Americans in P ostwar Film This course examines the presence of African Americans in mainstream Hollywood films during the postwar period. How did Holly - wood representations of African Americans change after World War II? What shifts and continuities occurred during the postwar pe-riod? And how did those changes reflect the ebbs and flows of civil rights activism through the 1970s? The goal of this course is ETHNIC STUDIES 119 to gain a deeper understanding of broader social and historical change by engaging the politics of race through a core aspect of American popular culture.

(5 units) 149. Civil Rights and Anti-Colonial Movements This course examines the connections be-tween two historical developments often treated separately: the U.S. civil rights strug - gle and African anti-colonial movements. By placing these two movements in a transna - tional framework, the course explores the global challenge to the racialized world order of the 19th and early 20th century. How did the civil rights struggle gain momentum in the aftermath of World War II? What was the longer history and role of \"black nation-alism\" and Pan-Africanism in the transna - tional struggle? What were the connections between the civil rights movement and con - temporary independence movements in Af - rica and Asia? One of the central goals of the course is to show how we can expand our understanding of U.S. history by reaching beyond the interaction between the U.S. government and other nation-states to ex - amine political and cultural change. Also listed as HIST 153. (5 units) 150. Urban Education and Multiculturalism This course takes a critical multicultural ap - proach to understanding urban education, encouraging a connection between theory and personal experience and observations.

Educational Inequality, Racism, and Resistance This course critically examines the connec-tion between educational inequality, racism, and resistance from a multicultural perspec - tive. Encouraging students to view racism beyond isolated incidents by individuals, this course will expose racial inequality in schools as sustained by laws and formal insti-tutions. In this course, students will be ex - posed to both theory and research that explore concepts including race and racism, racial microaggressions, stereotype threat, racial battle fatigue, internalized racism, and resistance. Students will examine the extent to which these forces impact multiple mi-nority communities in K-16 contexts, as well as community efforts for social justice. (5 units)120 COLLEGE OF ART S AND SCIENCES 152. Multiracial Identities This course focuses on multiracial identity constructs in African-American and Asian-American literature.

Race and World War II World War II stands as one of the most ex-plosive moments in U.S. and global history in the 20th century because of the myriad ways the conflict influenced the postwar world. The United States emerged from the war as the premiere global superpower in terms of combined military, diplomatic, and financial supremacy. However, the United States found itself under increased scrutiny due to its history and maintenance of struc - tural or institutionalized racism. In the midst of military and ideological conflict against the Nazi regime in Germany, and addressing the claims of civil rights and anti-colonial activists, the United States became a com-posite site of the tensions that defined a democratic society struggling with ongoing racism. This reading seminar explores these tensions, which were exacerbated by the rise of anti-racist perspectives in the anthropo - logical and biological sciences just preceding the war. The assigned readings and discus - sions engage these phenomena in order to properly explore the significance of \"race\" in the World War II era. Also listed as HIST 178. (5 units) 185.

The Haitian Revolution in World History and Memory Between 1789 and 1804, the French Carib - bean colony of Saint-Domingue was the site of the most profound and violent realization of the revolutionary spirit sweeping the At - lantic in the \"age of democratic revolutions.\" This era is usually associated with the French and American revolutions, both key events in the history of democracy and the rhetorical development of human rights as an agenda in the West. However, both stopped short of the most radical realization of the promises of the age of Enlightenment, particularly with regard to slavery and the racial discrimination that went along with it. The slave revolt on Saint-Domingue and the Haitian revolution, by contrast, witnessed the fullest realization of these promises in the form of the only success - ful slave revolt in human history. The events on Hispaniola took place at the nexus of world historical forces of globalization through com-merce , cross-cultural encounter, racial mixing, and the dispersal of radical Enlightenment ideas and their realization in the form of revolution. As a result of the powerful cur - rents of human history that flowed through the region, the Haitian revolution has proved to be an enduring source of both fear and creativity in the history of race relations, slav - ery, and abolition, and the forging of a new world identity for the descendants of the once enslaved populations of the island.

Urdan, Eleanor W. Willemsen Associate Professors: Carol Ann Gittens, Brett Johnson SolomonSenior Lecturer: Elizabeth Day The Liberal Studies Program offers a degree program leading to the Bachelor of Science in Liberal Studies. The Liberal Studies major is designed for undergraduates interested in a career working with children in community or school-based settings. There are two empha - ses available within Liberal Studies: Pre-Teaching and Child Studies, each of them leading to a B.S. degree. The Pre-Teaching emphasis provides a broad liberal arts background related to the elementary school curriculum, as well as a set of courses designed to introduce future teachers to the research foundations of best practices in education, child development, and issues and policies related to the schools. The Child Studies emphasis is designed for stu - dents interested in careers focusing on children such as, social work, counseling, family law, directing childcare programs, speech and language pathology, occupational therapy, or lead-ing nonprofit agencies that provide community services to children and families. Students with a B.S. in Liberal Studies in the Pre-Teaching emphasis are prepared to go on to post-graduate studies related to their career goals such as teacher credential programs. Students with a B.S. in Liberal Studies in the Child Studies emphasis are prepared to go on to post-graduate programs such as master's degree programs in psychology, social work, or other fields. Advisors in Liberal Studies can provide information about teaching credential pro - grams for the Pre-Teaching emphasis and graduate study programs for the Child Studies emphasis students.

(1-5 units)150 COLLEGE OF ART S AND SCIENCES DEPARTMENT OF MODERN LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES Professors: Rose Marie Beebe, Francisco Jim\u00e9nez (Fay Boyle Professor), Catherine R. Montfort Associate The Department of Modern Languages and Literatures offers courses in Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish, as well as degree programs leading to the bachelor of arts in French and Francophone Studies, German Studies, Italian Studies, or Spanish Studies. Honors programs are available for French and German majors. In addi-tion, the department offers minors in French and Francophone studies, German studies, Italian studies, Japanese studies, and Spanish studies. The courses are designed to help stu - dents achieve proficiency in both the oral and written language and to provide them with an understanding of the experiences, values, and traditions of those peoples whose lan - guages are studied. Courses range from beginning language to linguistics, from an introduc - tion to literary texts to advanced courses in literature and culture. All courses are open to any student with the requisite preparation. A few courses in literature and culture offered by the department are taught in English and are open to all students. Some of these courses may be used as credit toward a major or minor in French and Francophone studies, a major or minor in German studies, or a minor in Japanese studies. However, these courses in English will not fulfill the Undergraduate Core Curriculum foreign language requirement. Students may fulfill their second language Core Curriculum requirement by successfully completing a proficiency examination in a modern foreign language at the level for their program of study. Students who have never studied the language in which they wish to enroll, or who have studied that language for one year in high school, should register for Elementary Language 1. Those who wish to continue in a language that they have studied for two years in high school should enter Elementary Language 2. Students with three or more years of study in a single language, those who wish to continue language study beyond the second language requirement, or those who feel following the formula would place them in a higher- or lower-level course than their background warrants should consult a member of the appro - priate language faculty for placement advice. Students having the necessary proficiency, as demonstrated by an interview with a member of the language faculty, may enroll in higher-numbered courses than those of the placement formula. Once proficiency has been estab - lished, lower-division students may enroll in upper-division courses with the permission of the instructor. Such courses will be counted as fulfilling major or minor requirements. Courses numbered 1 through 102 are not open to challenge; for courses numbered above 102, consult the individual listing. For more information about placement and/or proficiency, please visit the department's website. Study abroad is a valuable enhancement of the undergraduate experience and is particularly recommended for students pursuing a major or minor in a foreign language. Both the Office of International Programs and the student's foreign language advisor should be consulted to ensure appropriate integration of the work done abroad into the student's program of study.MODERN LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES 151 REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJORS In addition to fulfilling Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of arts degree, students majoring in modern languages and literatures must complete the following departmental requirements for their specific major: Major in French and Francophone Studies FREN 100 and 101, or department-appr oved substitutes At least one course in French or Francophone literature Remaining electives in French or Francophone studies to total 40 quarter upper- division units chosen with the approval of the student's major advisor.

Felt, S.J., William J. Prior Professors: Philip J. Kain (Department Chair), Michael MeyerAssociate Professors: Christopher B. Kulp, Scott LaBarge, Lawrence Nelson, William Parent, Mark A. Ravizza, S.J., Shannon Vallor Assistant Professor: Michael W. HicksonLecturer: Brian Buckley The Department of Philosophy offers a degree program leading to the bachelor of arts in philosophy. Philosophy inquires directly into the relation of human beings to the world: what we are, how we know, what values are, how we live. Worth pursuing for its own sake, philosophical inquiry also promotes analytical thinking and precise expression and, thus, is excellent undergraduate preparation for a number of professional careers, such as law, government, writing, social work, and computer programming. To qualify for honors in philosophy, the major ordinarily must have a 3.5 grade point average in philosophy courses and complete PHIL 197 with a grade of A- or better. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of arts degree, students majoring in philosophy must complete the following departmental requirements: T wo lower-division courses from PHIL 2-10, 11A, 12A, 60-89 PHIL 25 or 27 PHIL 51, 52, 53, and 90 T wo courses from different historical periods: PHIL 131 (ancient), PHIL 132 (medieval), PHIL 133 (modern), and PHIL 135, 136, 137, 139 (contemporary), or PHIL 134, 139 One course from PHIL 120-129 One course from PHIL 125 or 140-149 Four additional upper-division courses from PHIL 109-199 Emphasis in Pre-Law The pre-law emphasis in philosophy is intended to help provide the skills of analytic reasoning and conceptual investigation necessary for the study of law. Philosophical research hones the techniques of careful argumentation and logically disciplined reasoning essential to the legal analysis of cases and statutes. Also, emphasis on ethics courses will help prepare students for the study and analysis of normative issues. The pre-law emphasis may be taken as part of a philosophy major or minor. Requirements for the pre-law emphasis include: One course from PHIL 25, 27, 29, or 152 One course from PHIL 111, 113, 114, or 154 One course from PHIL 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 80, 109, 110, 112, 114, 115, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 129, 136, or 142 T wo additional courses from those in the three lists abovePHILOSOPHY 181 Emphasis in Ethics The ethics emphasis in philosophy is intended to provide students with a broad under - standing of ethical theory and the conceptual analysis of moral problems, including matters of social justice central to the Jesuit educational mission, and thus with the ability to reflect on their own ethical decisions and on their role as morally responsible members of the human community. The ethics emphasis may be taken as part of the philosophy major or minor. Requirements for the ethics emphasis include: One lower-division ethics class from PHIL 2-10 T wo ethical theory courses from PHIL 120-129 T wo courses from PHIL 109-119, 154 An ethics course taught in another department may be substituted with the permission of the chair of the Department of Philosophy.

After all, politi - cal science is the closest of all majors to the institutions and values with which law deals. The primary study of law is the state, and so too for political science. Additionally, the demands of political science courses (reading of complex texts, independent research, frequent class presentations, and demanding writing assignments) strengthen the analytical and commu - nications skills that the practice of law requires. Requirements for the pre-law emphasis include a variety of courses from both inside and outside of the political science department. At most, six courses are required: three within the political science department and three from outside the political science department, although many of these courses fulfill other Core and political science major requirements.

Stephens The Public Health Program in the College of Arts and Sciences offers the bachelor of science degree in public health science. The program also offers a minor degree in public health, and manages the Global Health Pathway of the University Core. The public health science (PHS) major is an interdisciplinary degree providing students with a strong scientific foundation in biology and chemistry to understand the functioning of the human body in health and disease. The PHS major further addresses the complex influences of environmental and social factors on human health through relevant course-work in the social sciences and humanities. Courses for the major are drawn from numerous departments but are connected through required and elective public health courses. Through the senior capstone and a mandatory internship, PHS majors engage in health-focused service and research projects integrating learning across disciplines and apply their education to real-world public health problems. Students are encouraged to study abroad to gain perspective on global health issues. The Public Health Program is evolving and stu - dents are encouraged to petition the Director of the Public Health Program to consider new relevant courses developed at Santa Clara and partner institutions abroad in addition to the electives described below. Public health science majors will be well-prepared for careers, graduate education, or professional training in health-related professions, including medicine and nursing. There are many professional options in the field of public health, including healthcare administra - tion, planning, and public policy; epidemiology and disease surveillance; clinical research and clinical trials management; health-related education and social work; health and science communication; and basic research. Students intending to pursue a medical degree, or post-graduate training in other health- related professions, should contact the University pre-health advisor to discuss prerequisites for admission to such programs. Many require a full year of physics coursework (e.g., PHYS 11-13 or 31-33) and completion of the organic chemistry series (CHEM 33) in addition to the requirements for the Public Health Science major. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling the Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bach - elor of science degree, public health science majors must complete the following courses: PHSC 1, 100, 190 BIOL 21, 22, 24, 25 CHEM 11, 12, 13, 31, 32 Three introductory social science courses (two preferably from the same department) from the following: ANTH 1, ANTH 3, POLI 1, PSYC 2, SOCI 1, SOCI 33 MATH 11, 12 One statistics course: MATH 8 or PSYC 40 or SOCI 120 or BIOL 160 One public health elective: Any PHSC course other than the required courses listed above218 COLLEGE OF ART S AND SCIENCES Three natural science electives (at least two with lab) chosen from: BIOL 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 124, 127, 131, 145, 159, 160, 173, or CHEM 141 Three social science or humanities electives chosen from: ANTH 112, ANTH 165, SOCI 172, TESP 157, RSOC 170 Internship Requirement The PHS major requires students to complete at least 100 hours of public health-related internship work. Internships should be approved in advance by the Director of the Public Health Program. Internships can be done on a part-time or full-time basis, during the aca - demic year or summer. Students may receive course credit for volunteer internships. For guidance on internships, contact the Director of the Public Health Program. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR The interdisciplinary public health minor provides an introduction to the field of public health and is particularly useful for students interested in careers related to medicine, health care, community health, social work, education, or public policy. The public health minor establishes a sound scientific foundation to understand the functioning of the human body in health and disease and to appreciate the mechanisms by which diseases arise and spread in populations. Students also develop a foundation in the social sciences and statistical methods. Upper-division courses address the influences of biological, environmental, cul-tural, economic, and historical factors on human health. Students are encouraged to study abroad, if possible, to gain perspective on global health issues.

(1-2 units)THEATRE AND DANCE 243 DEPARTMENT OF THEATRE AND DANCE Professors: Aldo Billingslea, Barbara Fraser, Barbara Murray (Department Chair), Frederick P . Tollini, S.J. Associate Professors: Jerald R. Enos, S.J. (Paul L. Locatelli, S.J. Professor Professors: Kimberly M. Hill, Courtney Lecturers: Duarte, Kristin Kusanovich, David SwordLecturers: Karyn Connell, Pauline Locsin-Kanter The Department of Theatre and Dance celebrates creativity of the human spirit, offering a well-rounded education leading to a bachelor of arts degree in theatre arts with an empha- sis in either theatre or dance. This study involves both academic disciplines and creative processes. These include practice and analysis of skills required in the performing arts; criti - cal evaluation of literature, history, and theory of drama and dance; collaboration in pro - duction and public presentation of performance. The department also offers minors in theatre and dance as well as an interdisciplinary minor in musical theatre in cooperation with the Department of Music. Theatre and dance are distinct but related areas of emphasis. While each has its own set of requirements, students in either emphasis share common courses. Through lectures, stu-dio courses, labs, and productions, students work closely with faculty and staff mentors. The theatre program offers coordinated courses in acting, design, technical production, directing, dramatic literature, and theatre history. Students within the theatre emphasis will have a well-rounded foundation but may focus their study on any of the above areas. The dance program emphasizes modern dance and choreography, with additional train - ing in jazz and ballet. In these areas, students have many opportunities for performance and production; majors have the option of a senior recital, directing project, design assignment, or a senior thesis. Majors must fulfill the Undergraduate Core Curriculum and College of Arts and Sciences requirements for the bachelor of arts degree and the department require - ments in their emphasis area, theatre or dance. A degree in theatre arts provides preparation for many career options. Some students continue on to graduate school, perfecting skills in acting, dance, design, directing, or his - torical studies. Graduates in theatre and dance have successfully pursued careers in profes-sional theatre and dance companies, film, television, arts administration, and teaching. In addition, many have applied their skills in careers outside of theatre\u2014in medicine, law, management, marketing, development, and religion. A strong liberal arts education is inherent in the study of theatre and dance. Students are encouraged to work with their advisors planning a program that includes courses within their focus area and courses in other departments with related disciplines. Programs that partner well with theatre and dance include: English, music, communication, studio art, psychol - ogy, political science, and marketing. Students may combine theatre with various education waiver programs. Courses in theatre and dance can provide students of any major with experience in collaborative work, critical thinking, management, and communication skills. The theatre season usually includes at least four faculty-directed plays, three dance concerts, and student-directed plays and recitals. Participation in departmental productions is open to all members of the University community: students, faculty, and staff. Guest productions by professional dance and theatre companies occasionally form part of the season, and guest artists periodically direct, design, choreograph, or perform in shows with Santa Clara students. The University also offers an interdisciplinary minor in musical theatre. Please see inter - disciplinary minors for requirements.244 COLLEGE OF ART S AND SCIENCES REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling Undergraduate Core Curriculum and College of Arts and Sciences requirements for the bachelor of arts degree, students majoring in theatre arts must complete the following departmental requirements: Emphasis in Theatre THTR 9, 20, 21 and 30 THTR 41, 42 and 43 T wo courses from THTR 31, 32, 33 DANC 46 THTR 185 One course from THTR 116, 117, 118 DANC 159 or 189 Four approved 5-unit upper-division theatre or dance electives; two of which must be in alternate specializations: acting, design/technical, directing, history/literature, playwriting 4 units of THTR 39/139 Emphasis in Dance THTR 9, 20 and 30 DANC 67 One course from DANC 40, 41, or 42 One course from DANC 43, 44, or 45 DANC 46, 47, 48 and 49 One course from THTR 31, 32, or 33 DANC 143 and 146 T wo courses from DANC 140, 141, 142, 145, 147, or 148 DANC 162 or 166 DANC 159 or 189 T wo approved 5-unit upper-division theatre or dance electives 4 units of THTR 39/139 REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINORS Students must fulfill the following requirements for a minor in theatre or dance: Minor in Theatre THTR 10, 8 or 20, 30 or 31 One 4-unit lower-division theatre and dance elective Four 5-unit upper-division theatre and dance courses THTR 39/139THEATRE AND DANCE 245 Minor in Dance THTR 10 DANC 46, 47, 48, and 49 4 units of ballet or jazz DANC 143 and 146 One course from DANC 140, 141, 142, 145, 147, or 148 One 5-unit upper-division theatre and dance elective THTR 39/139 LOWER-DIVISION COURSES: THEATRE 7.

(2-5 units)256 COLLEGE OF ART S AND SCIENCES WOMEN'S AND GENDER STUDIES PROGRAM Professors: Laura Ellingson (Director), Professor: Sharmila Lodhia The Women's and Gender Studies Program brings together scholars and scholarship on women and gender, areas that have come to occupy an increasingly important place in a number of disciplines in the last quarter century. Areas of inquiry include the participation of women in social and cultural production; the construction of gender and its role as a constitutive element of social, political, economic, and legal structures; feminist theory, and the development of ideas about femininities, masculinities, and sexualities. Gender is exam - ined as it intersects with class, sexuality, ethnicity, disability, age, and nationality. The pro - gram organizes several public events throughout the year focused on gender issues, including lectures, symposia, films, and informal gatherings. Many of these programs are produced in collaboration with other academic departments, student groups, and the University's centers of distinction. The Women's and Gender Studies Program provides an integrated, interdisciplinary approach to understanding the social and cultural constructions of gender that shape the experiences of women and men in society. The curriculum offers a solid foundation in women's and gender studies, facilitating graduate study and careers involving gender justice concerns and preparing students for leadership roles in diverse workplaces and communi - ties. Women's and Gender Studies offers a minor and a companion major; a student must declare a primary major in another discipline (e.g., history, biology, or English) and a second companion major in women's and gender studies.

Finally, strategic marketing addresses competitive threats and opportunities, guiding a firm's efforts to deliver superior value. Because customer analysis and competitive advantage are so crucial to business success, a degree in marketing provides a solid foundation for a general manage-ment career leading to executive responsibilities. It can also provide the basis for a more focused career in such areas as advertising, retailing, sales, brand management, and market research.

This program is open to electrical engineer - ing majors with an approved grade point average in electrical engineering, mathematics, and physics courses. Under the combined degree program, an undergraduate student begins taking courses required for a master's degree before completing the requirements for the bachelor's degree and typically completes the requirements for a master of science in electri - cal engineering within a year of obtaining the bachelor's degree. Undergraduate students interested in the combined degree program are required to apply for the program between February of their junior year and December of their senior year. Students in this program will receive their bachelor's degree after satisfying the full undergraduate degree requirements. To earn the master's degree, students must fulfill all the requirements for the degree, including the completion of 45 units of coursework beyond that applied to their bachelor's degree. No course can be used to satisfy requirements for both the bachelor's degree and the master's degree. However, completion of 10 or more units of coursework in electrical engineering taken for the master's degree satisfies the pro - fessional development requirement of the undergraduate program. The program of studies for the master's degree may include up to 20 units of elective coursework from ELEN 112, 116, 117, 118, 127, 130, 133, 134, 141, 144, 152, 153, 156, 160, 161, 162, 164, and 167. These undergraduate units can count toward a master's degree only if a grade of \"B\" or better is earned. Students who do not complete the combined degree program within six years of entering the University will automatically be transferred to the regular master's degree program. Although six years is the maximum timeframe for completing the combined degree, full-time students enrolling in February of their junior year normally complete both degrees within five years.

Ayoubi, Hohyun Lee, Panthea Sepehrband Mechanical engineering includes all aspects of design, development, control, and manu - facture of mechanical systems and energy conversion systems. Mechanical engineering is essential to the proper design and manufacture of nearly every physical product in our modern world. As such, mechanical engineers are a fundamental resource for most indus-tries, and they work in interdisciplinary environments. Mechanical engineers must have the ability to see both broad perspectives across disciplines and industries, and solve very local and specialized problems. The undergraduate curriculum addresses the education and train - ing of mechanical engineering students and concentrates on two technical areas: (1) design and analysis of thermofluid systems for effective use of energy; and (2) design, analysis, and control of mechanical systems including the use of materials. The Mechanical Engineering educational program develops future engineers with a solid understanding of fundamentals and competence in analyzing engineering systems.

MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE STUDIES Director: Kathleen Maxwell The minor in Medieval and Renaissance studies offers students from all departments a cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary program of study in Europe's Middle Ages and Renaissance. These periods lay on the edge of modernity, when the distinctive characteris - tics of the contemporary world began to form and when major new connections were made between Europe and Africa, the Middle East, East Asia, and the Americas. Study of these periods from many different points of view affords an opportunity to gain valuable perspec - tives on the ways that Medieval and Renaissance persons, events, and institutions helped to shape the modern world. Completion of the minor is noted on the student's transcript, and students receive a certificate acknowledging their accomplishment.362 INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND O THER PR OGRAMS OF STUDY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR Students must complete the following requirements for a minor in Medieval and Renais - sance studies: Seven courses selected from three different departments with a maximum of three lower-division courses One of the upper-division courses must require an interdisciplinary research paper based on source materials and secondary works dealing with a topic rooted in the Medieval and/or Renaissance periods. The research paper requirement may be fulfilled by enrolling in MRST 199 under the supervision of an affiliated faculty member and the program director. The study of Fr ench, German, Greek, Italian, Latin, and/or Spanish is strongly rec - ommended but not required.

Seminar in Theatre and Dance before 1700 MUSICAL THEATRE Director: Barbara Murray The musical theatre minor offers experience and training in music, theatre, and dance as well as aspects of the visual arts and literature. Musical theatre is prominent in America as art, entertainment, social commentary, and civic engagement; it therefore plays a part in Jesuit education of the whole person for the service of others. The objectives of this program include entry-level proficiency for a career in performance, enhancement in teaching, or further training in graduate school; audition techniques; performance of acting, singing, and theatrical dance; and knowledge of the cultural history and various forms of musical theatre. The student may pursue one of two tracks: American musical theatre or lyric theatre (opera/operetta). REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR Theory: MUSC 1 and 1A Singing: MUSC 34 and three quarters of on-campus private voice instruction Acting: THTR 20, 123 Dance: T wo courses from DANC 40, 43, or 46 (or higher level dependent upon proficiency) Students in American theatre option: DANC 55 or 155, THTR 165 and 80 or 180 Students in lyric theatre option: MUSC 109, 153, and 194INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY 365 RETAIL STUDIES Director: Kirthi Kalyanam Retailing is a dynamic and fast-paced industry and encompasses many functional areas. It demands a blend of creative and analytical skills. The minor in retail studies offered through the Retail Management Institute is an excellent immersion experience that prepares students for a diverse set of careers including e-commerce, buying, merchandising, planning and allocation, digital marketing, and supply chain management. The program is open to all University undergraduates. Students entering the retail studies minor continue to major in their field of interest and receive their bachelor's degree in that field. Business majors get an opportunity to focus their studies and discover an exciting indus - try in which to build their passions. For many business majors, broad business theories will develop deeper meaning as they are applied specifically to the retail industry. The innova - tions in Internet retailing and supply chain management provide great opportunities for MIS majors and students interested in computer science. Retailing is at the forefront of trends in digital and mobile marketing, and social media. This provides a fertile ground for arts and science students to leverage their unique background. One of the most valuable and unique aspects of the retail studies minor is participation in an internship during the summer after the junior year. This immersion experience gives students insight into the retail industry and potential careers that are available. Students acquire experience through a full-time, 10-week paid or nonpaid internship at internationally rec - ognized retailers such as the Gap, HUGO BOSS, Williams-Sonoma, Phillips-Van Heusen, and Nordstrom. A wide variety of internships meet diverse student interests and needs. The minor is composed of a set of core courses and either a strategic multichannel or online and digital retailing option based on the interests of the individual student. The core courses include a multichannel retailing class in the spring quarter of their junior year and a two-quarter advanced retail seminar in the fall and winter quarters of their senior year. The core classes cover topics such as digital marketing, branding, product development, category management, negotiation, social media business analytics, supply chain management, e-commerce, and pricing and promotion analysis. Nonbusiness majors are encouraged to apply for admission to the program during their freshman or sophomore year to allow time to integrate their course of study in retailing with the requirements in their major field. Business students who have completed the lower-division requirements can enter the program as late as their junior year. The number of students admitted into the minor may be restricted in some years by the number of qualified internships available.

Yet many people compartmentalize science, technology, and society as if they were three separate and distinct domains of human experience, rather than under-standing them as mutually interpenetrating and reciprocally shaping each other. The sci - ence, technology, and society minor seeks to cultivate a richer understanding of these three domains to foster scientific and technological leadership and citizenship in our contempo-rary world. Students are required to select one of three emphasis areas: information technol - ogy and society, science and technology for the common good, or science communication. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR Students must complete the following requirements for a minor in science, technology, and society: Four classes in one of the three emphasis areas (information technology and society, science and technology for the common good, or science communication) Three additional classes approved as undergraduate science, technology, and society courses Students must also attend or volunteer at four symposia, colloquia, or public events sponsored by the Center for Science, Technology, and Society, and write brief critical sum - maries for a pass/no-pass evaluation by the minor advisor. Information Technology and Society Emphasis These classes address the role of computers, the Internet, and information technologies in modern society, and the transformative mutual influences in the relationships between society and these technologies. ACTG 134CSCI 3COMM 80SOCI 49, 149INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY 367 Science and Technology for the Common Good Emphasis These classes examine how science and technology can contribute to social benefit, espe - cially the well-being of underserved communities. They investigate the factors internal to the development of science and technology, as well as the societal factors (e.g., cultural, political, economic) that favor their development and application of science and technology to enhance the well-being of all.

Popko The minors in International Business and International Studies offer students from all majors the opportunity to develop an international component in their undergraduate education. Both minors offer the opportunity to incorporate academic work completed during study abroad with coursework on campus. MINOR IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Director: John ToppelThe minor in international business is designed to educate students in a broad range of management and business skills in a global context. The program includes coursework in language, social science, and international business and is open to all undergraduate stu - dents. The minor provides students with an understanding of the social, economic, and political context of international business, the language communication skills, and the busi - ness skills to be effective managers in a global marketplace. Students are encouraged to participate in a study abroad program or internship to complement this minor. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR Area Studies Emphasis Students must complete the following requirements for a minor in international business: Foreign Language One course from ARAB 23, CHIN 23, FREN 50, FREN 100, GERM 100, ITAL 100, JAPN 23, SPAN 23 Students who feel that they already have the required level of language competency must demonstrate such by completing one of the above (or a more advanced 100 or 101 level course). Other languages do not qualify.

Also, other eligible selected comparative politics courses may be approved by the director of the interna-tional business minor program.INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY 373 International Business T wo upper-division courses from ACTG 152, FNCE 151, MGMT 170, MKTG 178, ECON 181, ECON 182 (students should note that some of these courses may require prerequisites and may be offered only once per year.) Recommended (but not required) Completion of advanced language courses Participation in study abroad programs: approved equivalent courses taken abroad may fulfill requirements of the minor Internship related to an international business career Additional coursework in economic development, modern history, and politics of selected world regions MINOR IN INTERNATIONAL STUDIES Director: Susan M. Popko Students who pursue the International Studies Minor may examine themes or trends in globalization or intercultural communication or utilize the minor to add a global dimension or context to their major. The minor offers students the opportunity to pursue one of two emphases: the Area Studies emphasis in which students concentrate their coursework on selected geographic areas, (Africa, Europe or Latin America,); or the Thematic emphasis in which students concentrate their coursework on themes related to international or cross-cultural studies. The Area Studies emphasis may include a focus on Africa, Europe, or Latin America. The Area Studies emphases with a focus on Europe or Latin America each offer an interdis - ciplinary introduction to the cultures, languages, politics, and global challenges facing the region. The Area Studies emphasis with a focus on Africa also includes study of the African diaspora and related issues of slavery, colonialism, and globalization. The Thematic emphasis offers students the opportunity to examine broad international issues that transcend a single nation or geographic area. In the Thematic emphasis, the student has the opportunity to focus on a topic such as: poverty and development, global health, international law, international human rights, peace and conflict resolution, cross-cultural communication, international social justice in the arts, technology and globaliza - tion, the global dimensions of natural and physical sciences, diplomacy, gender and society, etc. Such subjects require systematic approaches distinct from the examination of single-nation or area studies.374 INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND O THER PR OGRAMS OF STUDY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR For the minor in international studies, students must complete the equivalent of four foundation courses plus an emphasis in either area studies or a theme as follows: Foundation Courses Foreign Language: T wo upper-division courses in a foreign language related to the chosen Area Studies or Thematic emphasis or the equivalent, as demonstrated through successful examination through the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures Social Science: T wo relevant courses in anthropology, communication, political science, or sociology; one of which must be ANTH 3, COMM 107A, POLI 2, POLI 25, SOC 133, or SOC 134 Capstone Course: A minimum of 20 hours in a class, academic internship, or community-based learning experience abroad.

Students develop their own themes and present a detailed proposal to the International Studies Committee for approval usually no later than the first quarter of their junior year. Students planning to incorporate academic work from a study abroad program should obtain approval prior to departure.INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY 375 STUDY ABROAD PROGRAMS Santa Clara University offers study abroad programs that develop academic understand - ing alongside personal reflection and deep engagement in the local culture. Approved pro- grams grow out of and extend the on-campus curriculum. During their first two years at Santa Clara, students build a foundation for the academic work they will pursue abroad. Students are encouraged to work with their academic advisor early to plan for study abroad, and to explore their goals with an advisor in the Study Abroad Program. In addition, approved programs offer students opportunities to integrate with the host culture and to approach the country in which they reside for a semester as a local. Many programs allow students to pursue independent research projects or internships abroad which, in turn, may serve as a basis for their senior capstone project. Santa Clara is commit - ted to encouraging access to study abroad for underrepresented students, from underrepre - sented academic disciplines, and in traditionally underrepresented geographic destinations. Therefore, students from all majors are eligible to apply to study abroad and students from the sciences and other underrepresented disciplines, in particular, are encouraged to apply. Likewise, Santa Clara students are strongly encouraged to pursue opportunities in tradition - ally underrepresented geographic areas of the world. Underrepresented students are strongly encouraged to apply for study abroad. Study Abroad is a privilege. The application process is competitive. Qualified under- graduate students are strongly encouraged to study abroad for a summer, quarter, or semes - ter in a country and academic environment that will enrich their overall college experience, contribute positively to the life of the University, and engender responsible participation in a global, multicultural society. Approved participants receive credits earned from study abroad programs that count toward the graduation requirement and with appropriate approval may fulfill major, minor and Core requirements. Grades are calculated into the Santa Clara University GPA and appear on the transcript. The University is committed to offering equal access to study abroad opportunities and therefore extends all financial aid to students during the period of study abroad. To apply for study abroad, students must be admitted to degree status at the University. Normally, students apply for study abroad in the term prior to participation. Applications are reviewed by the International Programs Office. The Office reserves the right to redirect students to alternate programs due to institutional considerations. Students must have completed a minimum of 88 quarter units by the start of the academic program abroad. Normally, students study off-campus during either junior or senior year. Sophomores with extenuating academic circumstances may request an exception to the eligibility policy. Students must declare their major with the Office of the Registrar prior to submitting their Petition to Study Abroad. A GPA of 2.75 is required to apply for off-campus study; the GPA require - ment for individual programs may be higher. Students are expected to meet or exceed Santa Clara's requirements and that of their proposed program. The selection process may be competitive and minimally qualified students may not be approved. Priority admission may be given to applicants for Santa Clara's own programs, including exchanges. Students on academic or disciplinary probation are eligible to apply for study abroad, but probation must be cleared by the start of the program off-campus.376 INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND O THER PR OGRAMS OF STUDY The study abroad application process is a two-step process and participation is contingent upon approval by the individual program, as well as the Santa Clara's International Pr ograms Office. In addition, participation is contingent upon satisfactory completion of all program prerequisites and related courses, as well as satisfactory academic progress toward the stu - dent's major. Students who earn a grade of D or F in any course in the term preceding their program may become ineligible for off-campus study. Students must clear any outstanding balances with the Bursar's Office in accordance with the Bursar's Office payment schedule (see www.scu.edu/bursar/payment/) to remain eligible for participation. The University does not approve study in countries for which the U.S. Department of State (DOS) has declared a T ravel Warning (see www.scu.edu/studyabroad/safety/). Matriculated students who study abroad while withdrawn from the University are ineligible for financial aid and scholarships. Withdrawn students may be eligible to receive a maximum of 10 units of transfer credit toward the graduation requirement, in keeping with the University's policy on transfer credit. No credit earned while withdrawn from the University may count toward a student's major, minor, or Core; students must receive approval through the on-campus application process to receive full major, minor, or Core credit for study abroad. Students should consult the policies governing units taken at other institutions in Chapter 8, Academic and Administrative Policies and Regulations. The Study Abroad Program offers mandatory pre-departure orientation and re-entry meetings for all study abroad participants and provides resources related to health and safety, which are also available on the Study Abroad website at www.scu.edu/studyabroad/. For detailed information about individual programs, including eligibility requirements, contact Study Abroad at studyabroad@scu.edu or 408-551-3019, or visit the Study Abroad website at www.scu.edu/studyabroad/. Students are urged to consult a Study Abroad advisor for information about the competitive application process. Currently approved study abroad programs are listed on the International Programs website at www.scu.edu/studyabroad/.

Philosophy of S uffering and Solidarity How ought we to live in a world marked by suffering and injustice? How should we in - terpret the chance meetings and intercon - nections that shape our lives? Can such moments help reveal what life is calling us to do and be? What role does a religious imagi-nation play in our postmodern world, espe - cially when we are faced with pain, violence, and disappointment? This course will begin to address these questions by exploring how we try to find meaning in a world filled with contingency and injustice.

Tao (Director) Assistant Professor: Position vacant at this time The Military Science Program offers classes open to all Santa Clara students and the Bronco Battalion, an Army Reserve Officer T raining Corps (ROTC) battalion of cadets from Santa Clara University, Stanford University, and San Jose State University. The Military Science Program is designed to develop management skills and leadership abilities for suc-cessful careers in both the corporate world and the military. Students who complete the ROTC program are eligible for appointment and commissioning as officers in the Army Reserve. Reserve commissions are tendered in all basic branches of the Army. A board of officers determines the branch in which students are commissioned based on their prefer - ence, leadership potential, academic background, and the needs of the service. The military science core curriculum consists of six lower-division classes in the ROTC Basic Course and seven upper-division courses in the ROTC Advanced Course. Cadets may take a summer course (MILS 24) in lieu of the six lower-division courses. The professional military education of ROTC cadets consists of two components: a baccalaureate degree from Santa Clara University (or one of the cross-enrolled universities) and at least one undergraduate course from each of five designated fields of study. Prior to commissioning, cadets must take at least one course in military history. The curriculum is divided into ROTC Basic Course requirements and ROTC Advanced Course requirements. To proceed to the ROTC Advanced Course classes, students must complete either the six required ROTC Basic Course classes or attend a summer class at Fort Knox, Kentucky. The director of the Military Science Program must approve exceptions to this progression. ROTC Basic Course Requirements The ROTC Basic Course, Fundamentals of Leadership and Management, includes the first-year and second-year courses (MILS 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, and 23) designed for beginning students who want to qualify for entry into the ROTC Advanced course and for those students who may want to try military science without obligations. A student can also qualify for entry in the ROTC Advanced Course by completing the summer training camp (MILS 24). ROTC Advanced Course Requirements The ROTC Advanced Course, Advanced Leadership and Management, consists of the third-year and fourth-year courses (MILS 131, 132, 133, 134, 141, 142, and 143) open to students who have completed or earned placement credit for the ROTC Basic Course. Students must complete all courses numbered greater than MILS 130, to include MILS 134, a six-week Leader Development and Assessment Course during the summer, in sequence, unless otherwise approved by the professor of military science. The ROTC Advanced Course qualifies students for commissions as officers in the U.S. Army. Students who do not desire to compete for a commission as an officer in the Army may take these courses for academic credit with approval by the professor of military science. Leadership Laboratories Leadership laboratories, held weekly for three hours, are required of all students. Perfor - mance during lab periods is reflected in the student's course grade. Labs include activities such as rappelling, terrain navigation, marksmanship, drill and ceremonies, and tactical field training exercises.INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY 383 Laboratory and Field Exercises During each quarter of class work, weekly lab work is required.

(3 units)386 INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND O THER PR OGRAMS OF STUDY PRE-HEALTH SCIENCES Advisor: Steven L. Fedder Santa Clara University has an excellent reputation for preparing students for careers in the health sciences. Most incoming students tend to be focused on either allopathic medi - cine or dentistry, but a much broader spectrum of careers can be equally or more attractive including osteopathic medicine, physical therapy, optometry, pharmacy, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, public health professional, and others. A Santa Clara education provides ample opportunity to acquire the academic foundations in natural science required by med - ical schools, and its broad liberal arts Core Curriculum also serves to develop the commu - nication, personal interaction, and analytical skills needed both during medical school and in one's subsequent medical practice. Although Santa Clara does not have a pre-med major, the courses prescribed by the Council of Education of the American Medical Association can be incorporated into several academic majors. Most medical schools require: One year of general chemistry (CHEM 11, 12, and 13) One year of organic chemistry (CHEM 31, 32, and 33) One year of biology (BIOL 21, 24, and 25) One year of physics (PHYS 11, 12, and 13 or PHYS 31, 32, and 33) One year of mathematics, typically calculus (MATH 11 and 12), and a statistics course In addition, many students become more skilled and competitive by enrolling in two or three upper-division science courses, often but not exclusively in biochemistry, genetics, and human physiology, which are helpful in preparing for the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). The combination of Core Curriculum requirements with the University's focus on community involvement and issues of diversity will prepare students well for the newly revised MCAT2015, with its greater emphasis on social, economic, and psychological deter - minants of health. The choice of academic major is much less important than completing the coursework above; however, many pre-health students select a natural science major such as biology, biochemistry, chemistry, or public health science. Students should thor - oughly examine the Pre-Health Advising website at www.scu.edu/cas/prehealth, and should maintain regular contact with the pre-health sciences advisor throughout the undergraduate years for assistance with adjustment to college academic rigor and social life; an appreciation of the wide array of available health care careers; assistance with the balance between aca - demics, social life, work, health community volunteering, and internships; and assistance with the relevant entrance examinations and application to graduate health science programs.INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY 387 PRE-LAW Advisors: Lawrence Nelson, Terri Peretti Santa Clara University provides a wide range of opportunities for undergraduates inter- ested in attending law school to build a strong pre-law foundation. Early in their under - graduate program, pre-law students should consult not only with their major advisor but also with one of the designated pre-law advisors to formulate a program designed for their specific needs and career goals. There is no specific major or curriculum required to qualify for law school admission. Successful law school applicants come from majors as diverse as anthropology, philosophy, communication, political science, physics, English, history, biol - ogy, and economics. Law school admissions officers recommend undergraduate preparation in a major that demands discipline, analytical ability, research skills, and precision in written and oral work. The departments of Philosophy and Political Science offer a pre-law empha - sis within the major (in philosophy, it is also available within the minor). Elective courses also provide valuable training and breadth of academic and analytical experience. Some elective courses strengthen specific abilities, while others provide perspective on legal issues and topics. Possible electives include, but are not limited to, the following: COMMUNICATION COURSES COMM 20. Public SpeakingCOMM 170A. Communication Law ECONOMICS COURSES ECON 126.

Sociology of Criminal Justice Systems PRE-TEACHING Director: Carol Ann Gittens Santa Clara University is accredited by the California Commission on Teacher Creden - tialing to offer professional preparation for prospective elementary school, middle school, and senior high school teachers. The Department of Education in the School of Education and Counseling Psychology offers graduate programs for the multiple-subject credential for elementary grades and the single-subject credential for secondary grades, both with a cross-cultural language and academic development emphasis. Students interested in teaching should consider completing a minor in urban education offered through the Liberal Studies Program. The Future Teachers Project (FTP), formerly known as the Eastside Future Teachers Project, works with students from traditionally underrepresented groups throughout Sili - con Valley and the greater Bay Area, who are interested in becoming teachers. Through innovative outreach and support programs, the goal is to develop leaders who will make an immediate impact on their communities. FTP scholars are generally recruited during high school and once at SCU, are considered for the FTP scholarship, which contributes to undergraduate studies and the credential program. The FTP is managed through the Liberal Studies Program. Preparation for Multiple-Subject Credential Students interested in a career in elementary school teaching should fulfill the require - ments of the liberal studies major with a pre-teaching emphasis in the College of Arts and Sciences. Those requirements can be found in Chapter 3, College of Arts and Sciences. Students must demonstrate the subject matter competency component for the multiple-subject credential by passing the California Subject Examination for Teachers (CSET) for Multiple Subjects. While students may sit for the examination whether or not they majored in liberal studies, both the examination and the liberal studies degree requirements are closely aligned with the state of California's elementary curriculum framework. Therefore, Santa Clara strongly recommends that students interested in being elementary school teach - ers major in liberal studies. An undergraduate minor in urban education is recommended for those students electing not to complete the liberal studies major. Students must also demonstrate basic educational skills by completing the Writing Skills exam that can be added to the CSET or by passing the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST). Preparation for Single-Subject Credential Students interested in a career in secondary school teaching in a particular subject matter area should fulfill the requirements of the academic major of their intended teaching spe - cialization. California teaching credentials are available in the following subject areas: agri- culture, art, business, English, health science, home economics, industrial and technology education, mathematics, modern languages, music, physical education, science, and social INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY 389 science. Students must demonstrate specific subject matter competency by passing the CSET in the subject area they desire to teach. Completing an undergraduate major in this subject area is not required but it is highly recommended. An undergraduate minor in urban education is also recommended. Students must also demonstrate basic educational skills by passing the CBEST. Selected California state credential coursework may be waived by successful completion of one or more specific undergraduate courses: A course in community health education by LBST 70 A course in teaching children with ex ceptional needs in the regular classroom by LBST 138 A course in educational policy, social foundations of education, and applied intern - ship by LBST 198 A course in child development b y PSYC 185 A course in the psychological foundations of education b y PSYC 134 Coursework on the provisions and principles of the United States Constitution by POLI 1, HIST 96A, or HIST 96B Requirements for Multiple-Subject and Single-Subject Credentials The minimum for the multiple-subject or single-subject teaching creden- tial include: A bachelor's degree in a subject area from an accredited institution Demonstrated knowledge of the United States Constitution by completion of under - graduate coursework or passage of an approved examination Demonstrated basic educational skills (see sections above for specific program re - quirements) Completion of an appro ved program of professional education, including field expe - rience achieved through student teaching or internship Completion of a state-appro ved subject matter preparation program or passage of the CSET, a subject-area competency examination, in the area one plans to teach For multiple-subject credential candidates only: Demonstrated knowledge of the various methods of teaching reading by passing the Reading Instruction Competence Assessment (RICA) examination Fifth-Year Teaching Credential Program The multiple-subject or single-subject teaching credential can be completed as part of the Masters of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program. This program requires a fifth year of study following the bachelor's degree and qualifies the student for a preliminary teaching creden - tial. The MAT program includes graduate coursework in educational foundations, curricu - lum design, teaching methods, and supervised student teaching. Students seeking additional information regarding the MAT program with a multiple-subject or single-subject teaching credential should contact the Graduate Department of Education in the School of Educa - tion and Counseling Psychology.3907 Admission of Undergraduate Students Santa Clara University is a selective admission university that admits new students based on past performance and potential for future academic success and contribution to the campus community consistent with the mission and Jesuit tradition of the University. Applicants are admitted as full-time, degree-seeking students.

In the School of Engineering, unit values for courses vary according to the number of hours in class per week.398 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGUL ATIONS Credit Unit Policy Academic work at Santa Clara University is measured by credit unit. A unit of credit represents that amount of time and effort both within and outside of formal settings that a student devotes to a particular class. At the undergraduate level, one unit of credit represents approximately three hours of work per week per term by the student, including time engaged in class and time committed to class preparation, studying, and assigned projects. A unit of credit for laboratory courses, independent study, internships, practica, and study abroad is awarded on the same basis as for a lecture course: one unit of credit repre - sents approximately three hours of work per week per term by the student. At the graduate level, course credit is determined by the college or school and is consis - tent with practices in the disciplines. Change of Academic Major A change of major within the same school or college requires the approval of the relevant department chair or program director. Students wishing to change their academic major within a school must submit a Program Petition form to the Drahmann Center. Change of School Entering freshmen are admitted to the University and to a specific school based on the preference indicated on their admission application. Students wishing to change schools within the University may not apply for such a change until the end of their first year of attendance. Changes between schools may be limited by the availability of space within the school and the specific academic major. Students wishing to change schools must meet the admit - tance criteria of the school and complete the application process specified by that school. Upon acceptance by the school, the student must submit a completed Program Petition form to the Drahmann Center. Repetition of Courses Students may only repeat a course in which they have received a grade of less than \"C-.\" In such cases, the grades of both the original and the repeated course are included in the calculation of the student's grade point average, but units are awarded toward graduation only once for each course passed. Certain courses, such as special topics courses and perfor - mance courses, are repeatable, and students will receive a grade and units for each successful completion. Students should consult the chair of the department in which the course is offered to confirm that a given course may be repeated for credit. Independent Study Students may pursue independent study through directed reading, directed research, internships, practica, or cooperative education. To qualify, a student must have demon - strated a sufficient knowledge of the academic discipline involved to make independent study both possible and beneficial. No more than 20 units of independent study may be used to satisfy graduation requirements, and no more than 5 units of independent study may be taken per term. Students must enroll for the term in which the independent study occurs. Directed reading and directed research are limited to upper-division students who undertake a research project or other well-defined study beyond the scope of a regular course under the supervision of a faculty member. Such work should be comparable to that required for courses of equivalent unit value.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 399 Students can obtain practical learning experience through internships, cooperative edu- cation, and practica. Internships and cooperative education are approved work experiences in a non-classroom environment in industry, government, or other setting, generally available only to upper-division students. Students who enroll in an internship or cooperative education experience for academic credit must fulfill specified academic requirements in addition to the responsibilities expected by the organization hosting the internship or cooperative educa - tion experience. Practica provide practical experience in a discipline-specific field experience or an approved University program activity, such as participation on the school newspaper. Practica are generally available only to upper-division students, but some practicum experi - ences are available to lower-division students who meet specified eligibility criteria. Students wishing to enroll in an independent study course must initiate the request for independent study with the appropriate faculty member, or with the Career Center for cooperative education experiences. The appropriate form, with the required materials and other approvals, must be submitted to the Drahmann Center for final approval prior to registering for the course. Challenging Courses Students may challenge certain courses to satisfy specific subject requirements for gradu- ation. A student may petition to challenge any course listed in the Undergraduate Bulletin except those involving laboratory, studio, or specialized group work and those whose descriptions in the catalog are followed by the letters NCX. No more than one course may be challenged each term. Although course requirements may be fulfilled by challenging a course, a successful challenge neither earns units toward the total needed for graduation nor contributes to the fulfillment of the residency requirements. In order to be eligible to challenge a course, a student must have completed at least one term at Santa Clara, have a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.3, and receive per - mission of the faculty member and the chair of the department in which the course is offered. Only currently enrolled students are eligible to challenge a course. To challenge a course, the student takes a special examination on the material covered by that course and meets any additional requirements specified by the department chair. Challenge examinations are arranged by the department chair, after the student files a Petition for Credit by Examination with the Office of the Registrar and pays the applicable fee. Course Requirements and Attendance Students are responsible for completing all course requirements as set forth by the instructor. Class attendance expectations and consequences for absences from class are left to the discretion of individual instructors. Students are accountable for all course assign - ments, whether or not the assignments were announced during an absence. Final Examinations A cumulative final examination, if given in a course, must be given on the date and time scheduled by the Office of the Registrar. If the final examination is a take-home exam, it may not be due before the scheduled final examination time. Exceptions to this policy require approval of the department chair and dean.400 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGUL ATIONS REGISTRATION POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Enrollment and Registration for Classes Students must be officially registered for all classes in accordance with the regulations, procedures, and dates in the Schedule of Classes. Registration is subject to full payment of tuition, room and board charges, and other fees associated with enrollment. The University reserves the right to deny registration to any student for reasonable cause. A student's eligi - bility to register for classes is subject to the clearance of any holds on the student's record for academic, financial, student conduct, or other reasons. Santa Clara students may not be concurrently enrolled at another college or university except for extraordinary reasons with the approval of the Drahmann Center. Students register for classes via University eCampus during the time assigned by the Office of the Registrar. Students who do not complete registration during the initial regis - tration period may do so during the published late registration period for the term. Initial registration for a term or class additions are not accepted after the last day of the late registra - tion period. During the first week of each term, students may add and drop classes in accordance with the procedures established by the Office of the Registrar. During the first, second, third, and fourth weeks of the term, a student may drop a class without receiving a mark of \"W\" for the class on their academic record. From the fifth week to the end of the seventh week of the term, a student may drop a class and receive a mark of \"W\" for the class on their academic record. Students may not drop classes after the last day of the seventh week of the term. Students who do not complete a course and do not drop the class in accordance with the required procedures will receive an appropriate grade in the class. Students who have not earned 44 units, including transfer credit, may be subject to administrative withdrawal from upper-division courses. This restriction does not apply to upper-division foreign language courses for which a student has demonstrated sufficient proficiency or to engineering courses in the major program. Students may not sit in a class without formally enrolling in the class. Sitting in a class or obtaining an instructor's signature on an add form does not constitute enrollment. Students who do not attend the first day of a class are subject to administrative cancella- tion of their enrollment in that class in order to make space available to other students. A student who must miss the first day of a class and wishes to remain in the course should contact the instructor in advance. No student who misses the first day of a class should assume that they have been dropped from the course. Students are responsible for checking the status of their enrollment in all courses prior to the end of the late registration period. Unit Overload Students may enroll for no more than 19 units unless they are in the University Honors Program, their cumulative grade point average at Santa Clara is at least 3.3, or they have upper-division status and obtain approval from the Drahmann Center. One 2-unit course or two 1-unit courses are not counted as overload units. Students who meet the criteria above will not be permitted to register for more than 25 units without approval of the Dean of Academic Support Services. Students may register for courses that result in overload units only during the late registration period. See the website of the Office of the Registrar for registration schedules.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 401 Auditing Courses Students admitted to degree status at Santa Clara may audit one course in addition to their regular course load in a term. A maximum of three courses may be audited during a student's academic career. Permission to audit a course will be given only at the end of the late registration period and only if space is available in the class. No credit is assigned for an audited course, but the successful completion of an audit will be indicated on a student's transcript by the notation \"AUD.\" Administrative Cancellation of Course Enrollment Students who enroll in a course for which they are not eligible are subject to administra - tive cancellation of their enrollment in that course. Prior to the end of the late registration period, an instructor may notify the University registrar to drop freshmen who registered in upper-division courses, to drop students who have not satisfied the prerequisites for the course, or to drop students lacking the instructor permission required for certain courses. Withdrawal from the University Students who wish to withdraw from the University must do so by the last day of classes, and must complete a withdrawal survey, appropriate forms, and an exit interview in the Drahmann Center. If the formal requirements for withdrawal are met, the student's registra - tion will be canceled without further academic penalty. Students who leave the University during a quarter without withdrawing in accordance with the required procedures will receive an appropriate grade in all courses in which they were registered and are not eligible for a refund of tuition or other fees. Students who withdraw from the University are responsible for any outstanding finan- cial obligations with the University. Students who used deferred payment plans or student loans during their attendance at the University must clear their financial obligations with the Financial Aid Office and the Bursar's Office. Students who have unpaid bills or other unsettled financial obligations with the University will not receive academic transcripts or be eligible for re-enrollment until they have cleared all such obligations. Withdrawal for Health Reasons Students may experience an illness, injury, or psychological condition that significantly impairs their ability to function successfully or safely in their role as students. In these instances, the Policy for Withdrawal for Health Reasons allows time away from the University for treatment and recovery until functioning is restored to a level that will enable the student to return to the University. The purpose of this policy is to set forth the procedures for student withdrawals from the University for reasons of health and/or safety. The University has designated four categories relating to withdrawal. They differ according to who initiates the action, whether it is voluntary or not, and the re-enrollment procedures. The vice provost for student life or designee, in consultation with the appropriate mental and medical health professionals and other staff as deemed necessary, is responsible for the implementation of this policy as stated in the Student Handbook. Re-enrollment at the University A student who withdrew from the University is eligible to re-enroll without special per - mission under the following conditions: The student left the Univ ersity in good academic standing The student has no outstanding financial obligations with the Univ ersity402 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGUL ATIONS The student plans to return to the same college or school at the U niversity The student is returning within fiv e years of the date of their withdrawal Students who do not meet the conditions above must seek permission to re-enroll from the Dean of Academic Support Services. Re-enrolling students are subject to degree and curriculum requirements in the Undergraduate Bulletin in effect at the time of re-entry. Students wishing to re-enroll must notify the Office of the Registrar in writing of their intent to return using the Returning Student form and should consult with a University advisor in the Drahmann Center to review their academic plans. Students on leave who have attended another college or university are only permitted to transfer in a maximum of 10 units of elective credit and are required to forward to the Office of the Registrar an offi - cial transcript of all work completed during their absence. GRADING POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Grading Grades are assigned by the instructor to reflect the quality of a student's work. The University uses the following grades: GoodC: AdequateD: Barely PassingF: Not PassingP: PassNP: No Pass The grades A, B, C, and D may be modified by (+) or (-) suffixes, except that the grade of A may not be modified by a (+) suffix. Grade point values per unit are assigned as follows: A = 4.0 A- = 3.7B+ = 3.3B = 1.3D = 1.0D- = 0.7F = 0 Unit credit, but not grade point credit, is awarded when the grade of \"P\" is assigned. Unit credit is not awarded when the grade of \"NP\" is assigned.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 403 The University also uses the following marks for which no unit credit or grade point value is granted: I: Incomplete N: Continuing workNS: No Pass (P/NP) A grade of \"P\" signifies that the quality of work done is equivalent to a letter grade of \"C\" or higher, while a grade of \"NP\" denotes work at the level of \"C-\" or lower. A maxi - mum of six courses taken under the pass/no pass option in which the student receives a mark of \"P\" can be used to fulfill the unit requirements for graduation. Some courses are offered only on a pass/no pass basis. If a graded option is not available, a course can satisfy Core, major, and/or minor requirements. A student with junior or senior standing and a declared major may choose to take an elective course on a pass/no pass basis. Students may enroll in only one elective course on a pass/no pass basis per quarter. Students may choose the pass/no pass option for a class through the end of the fourth week of classes, but may not change the grading option after that date. Incomplete (I) The mark of \"I\" (incomplete) may be assigned by the instructor when a student does not complete some essential portion of the assigned work in a class because of extraordinary circumstances beyond the student's control. The unfinished work must be completed and given to the course instructor within three weeks of the beginning of classes in the next scheduled term (not the student's next term of enrollment), excluding summer session, unless extraordinary circumstances require an extension. A request for an extension must be submitted in writing by the instructor and approved by the University registrar within the original three-week period. Extensions shall not be for longer than two academic quarters after the mark of \"I\" was assigned, excluding summer session. An incomplete that has not been completed within the specified deadline or has not received an approved extension will be converted to a grade of \"F .\" Continuing Work (N) The mark of \"N\" (continuing work) may be assigned by an instructor when course requirements span more than one term. When the course requirements are completed, the instructor assigns a standard grade. A student may not graduate and receive a degree with a mark of \"N\" on their academic record. No Show (NS) The mark of \"NS\" (No Show) may be assigned by an instructor when a student never attends a class and does not drop the class. A mark of \"NS\" cannot be changed to any other grade or mark after it is assigned by the instructor. A mark of \"NS\" is included in the stu - dent's academic record and appears on the student's transcript, but is not included in the calculation of the student's grade point average. No adjustment in tuition will result from the awarding of a mark of \"NS\" in a class.404 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGUL ATIONS Audit (AUD) The mark of \"AUD\" is assigned when a student enrolls in a class on an audit basis. A mark of \"AUD\" cannot be changed to any other grade. Withdrawn (W) The mark of \"W\" is assigned by the Office of the Registrar when a student completes the formal requirements for dropping a class or withdrawing from the University. A mark of \"W\" cannot be changed to any other grade or mark. A mark of \"W\" is included in the student's academic record and appears on the student's transcript, but is not included in the calculation of the student's grade point average. Grade Point Average A student's grade point average is determined by multiplying each grade point value by the number of quarter units assigned to the course, adding these grade point units from all courses taken, and dividing this sum by the total number of quarter units for which letter grades were reported. Grade reports are posted at the end of each quarter and indicate both the grade point average earned by the student during the quarter and the cumulative grade point average earned by the student for all courses completed to that point. Grades earned in courses in SCU-operated or SCU-affiliated study abroad or domestic study programs are included in the calculation of a student's grade point average. Grades earned in courses at other institutions accepted for transfer credit are not included in the calculation of a student's grade point average, but will be considered when determining honors at graduation. Evaluation of Progress Grades are available at the end of the term via University eCampus. Faculty members are expected to apprise students of their course progress at reasonable intervals. Some measure - ments of progress should take place in time to enable students to make reasonable decisions with respect to the fourth-week and seventh-week withdrawal deadlines. Change of Grade Only the faculty member responsible for a course may assign grades. All grades become final when they have been assigned and reported to the Office of the Registrar. A faculty member may report a correction of a final grade to the Office of the Registrar only if a cleri-cal or procedural error was made in assigning, transmitting, or recording the original grade. A grade may not be changed as a result of re-evaluation, re-examination, or the submission of additional work after the term ends. Any grade change must have the approval of the department chair and the associate dean of the student's school or college. No grade may be changed after one year. Student Appeals of Grades Grades are not negotiable. There should be no questioning of a faculty member's aca - demic judgment on a grade. In registering for a class, students implicitly agree to allow the faculty member to make a qualitative judgment of their command of the subject matter, which will be expressed as a letter grade. Any questioning or appeal of a grade should there - fore be limited to procedure, e.g., to computational errors or failures to follow grading poli - cies set forth in the syllabi.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 405 Any system of grade-appeal should protect the rights of faculty members as well as the rights of students. The results of any system of grade-appeal should not be binding upon the faculty member. Any decision to initiate a change of grade should remain the faculty mem - ber's. Any procedural complaint regarding a change of grade must be initiated within four weeks of the beginning of the next scheduled term, not including summer session. A student with a complaint must first discuss the matter with the faculty member. If the matter is not resolved at this level, the student may then take the matter to the chairperson of the department involved. The chairperson will discuss the case with the faculty member and may recommend that the faculty member review the grade. Upon the request of the student, the dean will proceed in similar fashion. Should the student request it, the dean will pass the matter on to the provost. This process of review gives the chairperson, dean, and provost the right to discuss the matter with the faculty member, and if they think it appropriate, request that the faculty member review the grade. Any recommendations made will not be binding upon the fac - ulty member against whom the complaint is lodged. The decision to change a grade remains with the faculty member. ACADEMIC STANDING AND STUDENT CLASSIFICATION Student Classification The University only admits students to its undergraduate degree programs on a full-time basis. Students who have not been admitted to degree status at the University may register for classes in accordance with the policies and regulations outlined in the section of this chapter covering non-degree students. The classification of students is determined by the number of quarter units completed with passing grades. Lower-division students are considered freshmen if they have com - pleted fewer than 44 units and sophomores when they have completed at least 44 units but fewer than 88 units. Upper-division students are considered juniors when they have com - pleted at least 88 units but fewer than 131 units and seniors when they have completed at least 131 units. If a student is enrolled for 12 or more units in a given term, they have full-time status for academic purposes. Students enrolled for less than 12 units have part-time status for that term and may not qualify for all University activities and benefits, such as eligibility for financial aid, on-campus housing, and intercollegiate athletic competition. Continuing enrollment at the University in part-time status requires approval by the Dean of Academic Support Services. Academic Standing To be in good academic standing at the University, a student must normally be enrolled for 12 or more units, must maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 based on all courses taken at Santa Clara, and must have completed at least a minimum number of units as specified below. Failure to meet these requirements may result in academic proba-tion or disqualification from future registration at the University. Students in their last term of enrollment before completing a degree may be classified as a full-time student when enrolled for less than 12 units.406 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGUL ATIONS Academic Probation Students at Santa Clara are subject to academic probation if their cumulative grade point average is lower than 2.0 based on all courses taken at Santa Clara. Students are also subject to academic probation if they fail to make satisfactory progress toward their degree as defined below: Completing at least 36 quarter units in the pr evious three quarters of residency or Completing at least 36 quarter units b y the end of the third quarter of residency Completing at least 76 quarter units b y the end of the sixth quarter of residency Completing at least 115 quarter units b y the end of the ninth quarter of residency Completing at least 160 quarter units b y the end of the 12th quarter of residency Academic Disqualification Students are subject to disqualification from further registration at the University for any of the following: Remaining on academic probation for more than two consecutive quarters without improvement Failing to maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 or Completing few er than 30 quarter units by the end of the third quarter of residency Completing few er than 64 quarter units by the end of the sixth quarter of residency Completing few er than 100 quarter units by the end of the ninth quarter of residency Completing few er than 150 quarter units by the end of the 12th quarter of residency Reinstatement to the University Reinstatement to the University after disqualification is rarely permitted and requires favorable action by the Dean of Academic Support Services in consultation with the dean of the student's college or school. Requests for reinstatement are made to the Dean of Aca - demic Support Services and must include a description of any activities during the period of disqualification that would indicate that an improved academic performance can be expected in the future. A student generally may not apply for reinstatement within a year of the date of disqualification. The request for reinstatement will be considered only if the student's academic deficiencies can be corrected within a reasonable time.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 407 ACADEMIC CREDIT EVALUATION Santa Clara awards credit based on the Advanced Placement Program, the International Baccalaureate Program, courses completed at other colleges and universities, and courses completed in University-approved study abroad and domestic study programs using the criteria outlined herein. Students may not take a course for credit for which they have received advanced placement, International Baccalaureate, or transfer credit. Credit is not awarded for the College-Level Examination Program (CLEP). Advanced Placement Credit Santa Clara participates in the Advanced Placement Program to recognize college-level academic achievement prior to matriculation and to encourage students to pursue advanced studies in their areas of interest. Credit or placement is determined by the appropriate department based on review of the student's Advanced Placement scores, sometimes in the context of supplemental departmental examinations. Students will be notified of advanced placement credit upon matriculation at the University. The following chart indicates the subject examination, required scores, and Santa Clara credit granted through the Advanced Placement tests. Courses waived will always satisfy relevant requirements in the major of the department that offers the course. However, only some courses waived will satisfy requirements in the Core Curriculum. Courses waived by AP test scores, when relevant, may satisfy Second Language, Mathe- matics, Natural Science, and Social Science requirements in the Core Curriculum. No other undergraduate Core requirement can be satisfied with AP test scores. Final decisions on academic credit for some AP scores are made individually by the appropriate academic department in consultation with the University Registrar.

Transfer Credit and the Core Curriculum T wo sets of rules for awarding transfer credit for Core areas are in place, one for students admitted as freshmen and another for transfer students. All students must satisfy the following Core requirements at Santa Clara University: Civic Engagement; Science, Technology & Society; Advanced Writing; Experiential Learning for Social Justice; and Pathways. Students admitted as freshmen must also satisfy Critical Thinking & Writing and Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2 with courses completed at Santa Clara University. In contrast, students admitted as transfers are encouraged to complete Critical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2 and Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2 before their first quarter at Santa Clara. For transfer students only, transfer credit for Critical Thinking & Writing may include 410 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGUL ATIONS exemptions granted at other schools and credit granted through Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate test scores. Information about possible substitutions for Critical Thinking & Writing and Cultures & Ideas courses is available in the Office of the Registrar. T ransfer students who enter the University with fewer than 44 units must take all three Religion, Theology & Culture courses in the required sequence. Students matriculating with 44 or more units of transferable college credit, which does not include any Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate test credit, must complete two courses, in any order, from any two of the following three categories: Religion, Theology & Culture 1, 2, or 3. T ransfer students must declare their Pathways by the end of their third quarter at SCU. T ransfer students in the College of Arts and Sciences and Leavey School of Business who matriculate with fewer than 44 units must take four courses to fulfill the Pathways require - ment. T ransfer students in the College of Arts and Sciences and Leavey School of Business who matriculate with more than 44 units must take three courses to fulfill the Pathways requirement. All transfer students in the School of Engineering must take three courses to fulfill the Pathways requirement. Students who transfer to Santa Clara University should consult Chapters 4 and 8 as well as the chapters relevant to their school or college. Units Taken at Other Institutions Credit is awarded for coursework completed at other colleges and universities subject to certain limitations. Courses from accredited institutions are generally transferable if they are similar in nature to courses listed in the Santa Clara University Undergraduate Bulletin. Courses from California community colleges are also generally transferable under the same conditions and if designated as transferable to the University of California. Courses of a trade or technical nature do not transfer. Courses from colleges not accredited, trade schools, extension programs, or correspondence programs do not transfer. T ransfer students can receive credit for coursework completed at other colleges and uni - versities prior to matriculation at Santa Clara for no more than half of the total number of quarter units required for the specific Santa Clara degree. After enrolling at Santa Clara, students can receive credit for coursework completed at other colleges and universities for no more than 10 quarter units of free electives, subject to the limitation that no more than half of the total number of quarter units required for a Santa Clara degree can be earned at another institution. T ransfer credit earned after initial enrollment at Santa Clara may not be used to fulfill Undergraduate Core Curriculum, college or school, department, or program requirements. T ransfer credit for all coursework completed at other colleges and universities requires approval from the Office of the Registrar and the chair of the department offering the equivalent Santa Clara course. The student must have earned a grade of \"C\" or better in a course for transfer credit to be granted. Courses taken on a pass/no pass or credit/no credit basis are not accepted as transfer credit. Grades for units earned at other institutions are not included in a student's Santa Clara academic history or in the calculation of the Santa Clara grade point average. Study Abroad and Domestic Study Programs Units and grades earned for coursework in University-operated study abroad programs, University-affiliated study abroad programs, University study abroad exchange programs, and University-affiliated domestic study programs are included in a student's Santa Clara academic history. Units earned in approved study abroad and domestic study programs may be used to fulfill Undergraduate Core Curriculum, college or school, department, or ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 411 program requirements subject to prior approval by the appropriate dean's office, department chair, or program director. However, such units do not satisfy the University residency requirement.

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY The University is committed to academic excellence and integrity. Students are expected to do their own work and to cite any sources they use. A student who is guilty of a dishonest act in an examination, paper, or other work required for a course, or who assists others in such an act, may, at the discretion of the instructor, receive a grade of \"F\" for the course. In addition, a student found guilty of a dishonest act may be subject to sanctions, up to and including dismissal from the University, as a result of the student judicial process as described in the Student Handbook. A student who violates copyright laws, including those covering the copying of software programs, or who knowingly alters official academic records from this or any other institution is subject to similar disciplinary action. Academic Integrity Protocol Allegations within the Context of a Course These procedures are intended to protect the integrity of the instructional program and of student academic achievement. Any member of the Santa Clara University community with a suspicion or evidence of academic dishonesty of some kind as described in the Stu - dent Conduct Code (e.g., plagiarism, falsification of data, misrepresentation of research, or the use of prohibited materials during an examination, and other acts generally understood to be dishonest by faculty or students in an academic context) may initiate an allegation of student academic dishonesty. The following describes procedures for resolution by due process. If the allegation arises within the context of a course or academic assignment, its resolu - tion begins with the instructor responsible for that course or assignment, who informs the student of the suspicion. If the instructor judges on the basis of available evidence that an academic violation has occurred, the instructor applies an academic sanction and notifies the student of the reason for the academic sanction. The instructor decides on the severity of the academic sanction (e.g., refusal to accept an assignment, \"F\" on the particular assign - ment, or \"F\" for the entire course). The instructor will report in writing to the department chair and the Office of Student Life what violation of academic integrity has occurred and what academic sanction has been applied. The Office of Student Life will pursue the matter as a violation of the Student Conduct Code through the University judicial process. This process is not intended to limit academic freedom.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 413 Appeal Process for Academic Sanctions If, after discussion with the instructor concerning the academic sanction applied, the student wants to challenge the instructor's decision, the student will contact the chair of the department in which the course is offered. If the instructor is the department chair, then the appeal is made to the dean of the school or college in which the course is offered or his/her designate, and the dean or designate refers the case to the chair of a closely related department. The department chair hearing the appeal has the option to convene an ad hoc panel if he or she believes that the complexity of the case warrants doing so. The student suspected of committing academic dishonesty has the right to bring a support person whose only role is to accompany the student to the hearing. The panel will include two full-time faculty members from the department in which the course was offered, one full-time faculty mem - ber from a closely related department, and two students who are trained student judicial board members. Staff in the Office of Student Life will arrange for the participation of the student panel members. The charge of the panel is to study all previously considered and newly developed evidence, review statements of all parties concerned, interview all parties concerned, and make a recommendation to the department chair. The parties involved have the right to file an objection to the appointment of a particular faculty member or student to the ad hoc panel. This objection must be based upon a belief that the named faculty member or student is unable to conduct an impartial evaluation and therefore will not review the case in an impartial manner. The objection is filed with the chair hearing the appeal who will make a ruling on this objection. If necessary, the chair will then appoint a different faculty member or student. After reviewing all relevant materials and information, including the recommendation of the ad hoc panel when one is convened, the department chair will consider all evidence available, confer with all parties concerned, inform all parties of her or his recommendation regarding the alleged violation, and report the recommendation to the student and the Office of Student Life. However, final responsibility for assigning grades remains with the instructor of the course. Decisions may only be appealed to one level above the instructor. All proceedings are intended to be confidential. If the student wishes to withdraw from the course, the instructor's approval is required for the withdrawal process. The instructor may refuse to approve of the withdrawal and may assign an appropriate grade. University Judicial Process When the Office of Student Life receives the report, the assistant dean will meet with the student to discuss the relevance of the violation to the Student Conduct Code. Whether further judicial sanctions are applied or not, the report of academic dishonesty will remain on file in the Office of Student Life for the remainder of the student's enrollment at Santa Clara University. The student involved has the right to include a statement as part of these files. If it is ruled that the student committed an academic integrity violation, the Office of Student Life will administer a judicial sanction that would range from a letter of warning to expulsion from the University. The severity of the judicial sanction depends on the severity of the circumstances, including the student's judicial history and previous academic integ-rity violations.414 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGUL ATIONS Allegations Outside a Course If the allegation involves a situation outside the context of a course, resolution begins with the Office of Student Life. The assistant dean will confer with all parties concerned. After hearing all evidence and conducting further investigation as needed, the assistant dean will either hear the case or refer it to a judicial board in accordance with the University Judicial Process. The outcome of the hearing will be communicated to those involved. PATENT POLICY For information on the University's Patent Policy, contact the Office of Research Initiatives at www.scu.edu/provost/research. ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS CLERY ACT In accordance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, Santa Clara University annually collects information about campus crimes and other reportable incidents as defined by the law. Information presented in com-pliance with this act is made available to assist current and potential students and employees in making informed decisions regarding their attendance or employment at the University. These reports and other information about the law are available on the Campus Safety website. It is the policy of Santa Clara University that the campus community will be informed on a timely basis of all reports of crime and other information affecting the secu-rity of our campus and the personal safety of our students, faculty, staff, and guests. COMMUNICATION BY THE UNIVERSITY TO UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS The University will communicate with undergraduate students through a variety of for - mats. Information that is sent to undergraduate students from the University via their cam - pus mailbox, local address, or their Santa Clara email address is considered official communication and should be treated as such. Students are asked to check their campus mailbox and their Santa Clara email account on a daily basis, and are responsible for reading and responding to the information they receive from the University. The University urges undergraduate students to use their Santa Clara email address as their primary email; stu - dents who will not be checking that address regularly should forward their email to their preferred email account. CONSENSUAL RELATIONS BETWEEN EMPLOYEES AND STUDENTS In addition to prohibiting sexual harassment under the Policy on Unlawful Harassment and Unlawful Discrimination, the University prohibits any consensual dating, romantic, or sexual relationship between an employee and a student over whom that employee has any instructional, supervisory, advising, or evaluative responsibility. Such a relationship is fraught with problems, including the potential for exploitation, favoritism, and conflict of interest. The appearance of impropriety or unfairness may also adversely affect the learning and work environment for other students and employees. This policy applies to faculty, staff, and student employees. Employees who violate this policy are subject to sanctions for ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 415 misconduct under the policies of the Faculty Handbook, Staff Policy Manual, or Student Employment Handbook, as appropriate to their employment status. Employees or students with questions about this policy should contact the Office of Affirmative Action or the Department of Human Resources. DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE AND SCHOOL PROGRAM It is the goal of Santa Clara University to maintain a drug-free workplace and campus. The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, and/or use of controlled substances or the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of alcohol is prohibited on the Santa Clara University campus, in the workplace, or as part of any of the University's activi - ties. This includes the unlawful use of controlled substances or alcohol in the workplace even if it does not result in impaired job performance or in unacceptable conduct. The unlawful presence of any controlled substance or alcohol in the workplace and campus itself is prohibited. The workplace and campus are presumed to include all Santa Clara premises where the activities of the University are conducted. Violations will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employ - ment for faculty and staff or expulsion of students. A disciplinary action may also include the completion of an appropriate rehabilitation program. Violations may also be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution. The program information is distributed on an annual basis to all faculty, staff, and stu - dents. New staff employees are given a copy at New Employee Orientation. New faculty employees are given a copy at New Faculty Orientation. The program is reviewed at least biennially by the Office of Student Life, Affirmative Action Office, and the Department of Human Resources. STUDENT RECORDS AND RELEASE OF INFORMATION The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) protects the confiden - tiality of the University records of Santa Clara University students. A student is any person who attends or has attended a class, which includes courses taken through videoconference, satellite, Internet, or other electronic and telecommunication technologies, and for whom the institution maintains education records. The University is authorized under provisions of the Act to release directory information to any person on request, unless a student explic - itly requests in writing that the University not do so and keep directory information confidential. A student's directory information is designated as follows: Student's name Address: Campus post office box, local, and permanent addresses (residence hall and room numbers are not disclosed) Telephone number Email address Photograph Date and place of birth Major field of study Classification level/academic standing Dates of attendance (defined as academic year or quarter)416 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGUL ATIONS Participation in officially recognized activities and sports Weight and height of members of athletic teams Degrees (including expected or actual degree date), honors and awards received, and dates Most recent educational agency or institution attended During the registration period and throughout the academic year, students may request in writing through the Office of the Registrar that directory information be kept confiden - tial. Once filed, the request remains in effect until the beginning of the next academic year or a shorter period if designated by the student. Graduating students must notify the Office of the Registrar in writing to remove the nondisclosure notation from their record. The University is authorized under FERPA to release educational and directory informa - tion to appropriate parties without consent if the University finds an articulable and signifi - cant threat to the health or safety of a student or other individuals in light of the information available at the time. Former or current borrowers of funds from any Title IV student loan program should note carefully that requests for nondisclosure of information will not prevent the University from releasing information pertinent to employment, enrollment status, current address, and loan account status to a school lender, subsequent holder, guarantee agency, the United States Department of Education, or an authorized agent. Students have the right to inspect and review their educational records at the following offices: Official academic records, including application forms, admission transcripts, letters of acceptance, and a student's permanent academic record are on file and maintained in the Office of the Registrar Working academic files are maintained by the Drahmann Center Records related to a student's nonacademic activities are maintained in the Office of Student Life Records relating to a student's financial status with the University are maintained in the various student financial services offices Certain records are excluded by law from inspection, specifically those created or main - tained by a physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist in connection with the treatment or counseling of a student. Parents' financial information, including statements submitted with scholarship applications, is also excluded by law from inspection. Third parties may not have access to educational records or other information pertaining to students without the written consent of the student about whom the information is sought. Students have the right to request the amendment of their educational records to ensure that they are not inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student's privacy or other rights.

National Merit Scholarship The National Merit Scholarship Corporation in conjunction with the Financial Aid Office, awards four merit-based scholarships to selected academically talented high school seniors for undergraduate studies at Santa Clara University. Prospective Santa Clara University freshmen who have been selected as National Merit Finalists and who have listed Santa Clara University as their \"first- choice\" school on the National Merit Scholarship Application are eligible for consideration. Santa Clara University-sponsored National Merit Scholars will receive $2,000 per year, renewable for up to four years of undergraduate study. Athletic Scholarships The Department of Athletics awards scholarships to student-athletes competing in inter - collegiate sports sponsored by the University in accordance with the regulations of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the West Coast Conference. Depend - ing on the sport and the student-athlete's eligibility, individual scholarships vary up to the full cost of attendance as defined by NCAA regulations. The Financial Aid Office will coor - dinate athletic scholarships with other financial aid awards in accordance with applicable federal, state, and University regulations. Community Facilitator Grants Students who are community facilitators in the Residential Learning Communities receive a grant generally equivalent to the cost of room and board for their service in that role. The Financial Aid Office will coordinate community facilitator grants with other financial aid awards in accordance with applicable federal, state, and University regulations. Faculty and Staff Tuition Remission Santa Clara University Tuition Remission Santa Clara faculty and staff and their dependents enrolled as undergraduate students are eligible to receive a tuition remission grant in accordance with Policy 609 (Education Ben - efits) in the Staff Policy Manual. T uition remission grants only cover tuition costs. Students are responsible for room and board charges and other fees associated with their enrollment.

FACHEX Faculty and Staff Children Exchange (FACHEX) is a tuition remission program for children of full-time faculty and staff established by the Conference of Academic Vice Presi - dents of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities. Under the FACHEX program, employees who have a tuition remission benefit for their children at their home institution are eligible to apply for the same benefit at participating Jesuit colleges and universities. The home institution determines specific eligibility requirements. Because each participating institu - tion determines the number of FACHEX it will award to incoming students each year, there are no guarantees to the children of a given faculty or staff member that they will be able to utilize the FACHEX benefit at the institution of their choice. FACHEX only cover tuition costs. Students are responsible for room and board charges and other fees associated with 426 TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID their enrollment. Children of Santa Clara employees who utilize the FACHEX program at another institution and subsequently transfer to Santa Clara University as an undergraduate student are not eligible for a Santa Clara University tuition remission. Tuition Exchange Grants T uition Exchange is a tuition grant program for dependent children of faculty and staff managed under a partnership program involving almost 600 colleges and universities. Dependent children of University employees are eligible to participate in the T uition Exchange program in accordance with Policy 609 (Education Benefits) in the Staff Policy Manual. T uition Exchange grants are not a guaranteed award, but are based on each institution maintaining a balance between students sent on the exchange (exports) and students received on the exchange (imports). Most tuition exchange grants cover full tuition for four years at the host institution. Students are responsible for room and board charges and other fees associated with their enrollment. Institutions with tuition costs greater than $25,000 are permitted to award less than their full tuition but not less than $25,000. The T uition Exchange Board of Directors sets the minimum value of a T uition Exchange grant annually. Any difference between the T uition Exchange grant value and the actual tuition is the responsibility of the student.

The Financial Aid Office will coordinate private scholarships with other financial aid awards in accordance with applicable federal, state, and University regulations. STUDENT EMPLOYMENT Campus Employment Part-time jobs for undergraduate students are available in many offices and departments on campus. Campus job listings are maintained by the Student Employment Office. Students earn an hourly wage at least at the current minimum wage rate for the state of California and may be paid at a higher rate depending on the type of work or skills required.

LOANS Federal Perkins Loans Perkins Loans are federally funded low-interest loans provided to undergraduate and graduate students based on financial need and administered by the University. Depending on funds available, a student may borrow up to $5,500 per year while enrolled as an under - graduate student. Repayment of this federal loan begins nine months after completion of the deferment period, or upon graduation. The interest rate on a Federal Perkins loan is 5 percent fixed. William D. Ford Federal Direct Loans William D. Ford Federal Direct Loans are federally funded low-interest loans provided to undergraduate and administered by the United States Department of Education. Under the Federal Direct Loan program, a student may borrow funds for educationally related expenses and defer repayment until six months after graduation or when the enrollment status drops below half-time (e.g., less than 6 units). If an undergraduate is an independent student or a dependent student whose parents were denied for a Federal Direct PLUS Loan, the student can borrow more funds through the Federal Direct Loan program based on their academic grade level. To receive a subsidized Federal Direct Loan, a student must have financial need. Interest is not charged on a subsidized Federal Direct Loan while the student is enrolled at least half-time. Eligibility for unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans is determined after eligibility for subsidized Federal Direct Loans is decided. Interest accrues on unsubsi - dized Federal Direct Loans during all periods, including while the student is enrolled in school and during any grace or deferment periods. Federal Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students A parent or step-parent of a dependent student may apply for a Federal Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Student (Federal Direct PLUS) through the William D.

FINANCIAL AID ELIGIBILITY Enrollment Status and Financial Aid Eligibility Undergraduate students receiving financial aid must meet general University eligibility requirements and any applicable eligibility criteria associated with specific federal, state, or University aid programs from which they are receiving support. Financial aid recipients generally must be enrolled as full-time students in a minimum of 12 units each quarter in which aid is received, must be making satisfactory progress toward a degree, and must main - tain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0. Financial aid awards to students TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID 429 who drop below full-time status (e.g., less than 12 units) will be adjusted unless certification for continuing eligibility is granted by the Financial Aid Office. Eligibility for financial aid is limited to a maximum of 12 quarters of undergraduate study. Financial aid awards will cease after the 12 quarters of enrollment in a post-secondary institution unless certification for continuing eligibility is granted by the Financial Aid Office. Specific financial aid awards may have additional requirements for continuing eligibility. Academic Standing and Satisfactory Progress Requirements All financial aid recipients must maintain good academic standing and be making satis - factory progress toward a degree according to the University standards and applicable federal and state regulations. Students are evaluated for satisfactory academic progress each quarter. Qualitatively Students must maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher. Note: Some Santa Clara University aid programs require a higher cumulative grade point average than the federal minimum requirement. Quantitatively Students must maintain a cumulative 75 percent completion rate for all units attempted toward their academic programs.Maximum Attempted Units Allowed Students must complete the requirements for their academic programs within 150 percent of the minimum units required to complete their academic programs. Units attempted also include all units transferred into Santa Clara University from prior institutions that can be used to satisfy students' academic program requirements. Students who have reached their maximum attempted units allowed are ineligible for additional financial aid. Students may appeal for financial aid probation status if they feel their circumstances warrant an exception to this standard. Unit Requirements Completion Requirements Undergraduate Students are required to complete 36, 72, 108, 144, 180, and 216 cumulative quarter units by the end of their third, sixth, ninth, 12th, and 15th quarters of enrollment, whether at Santa Clara University or elsewhere, in order to maintain satisfac - tory academic progress. Unit Requirements All financial aid recipients must register for and maintain a full course load of 12 units or more per quarter, if the aid was awarded on this basis. Students who drop below 12 units will see their financial aid adjusted. Full-time and part-time status are defined as follows: Full-time: 12 or more units Three-fourths time: 7 to 11 units Half-time: 6 units Less than half-time: few er than 6 units430 TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID Courses Incompletes, Withdrawal, Failures, and/or Repetitions Incompletes (I), Withdrawals (W), Failures (F), and/or repeated courses will adversely affect a student's completion rate. Students must complete the minimum number of units to fulfill federal, state, and University requirements. Completion rates are calculated cumu-latively and will include all quarters that the student was enrolled, whether or not the student received financial aid. Students who wish to withdraw from Santa Clara University during a quarter must complete a withdrawal form and an exit interview in the Drahmann Advising and Learning Resource Center. If the formal requirements for withdrawal are met, the student's registra - tion will be canceled without academic penalty. A withdrawal notation (W) will be assigned for each course from which the student withdraws after the fourth week of the quarter. Students who leave Santa Clara University during a quarter without formally withdrawing are subject to failing grades in all courses in which they were registered and are ineligible for refund of fees. IMPORTANT: Any student leaving Santa Clara University at the conclusion of any quarter should also complete the standard withdrawal process. Repetition of Courses Students may only repeat a course in which they have received a grade of less than C minus (C-). In such cases, the grades of both the original and the repeated course are included in the calculation of the student's grade point average, but units are awarded toward graduation only once for each course passed. Certain courses, such as special topics courses and performance courses, are repeatable, and students will receive a grade and units for each successful completion. Evaluation All students enrolled at Santa Clara University are evaluated for satisfactory academic progress end of each quarter after the Office of Registrar has released official grades.Definitions of Satisfactory Academic Progress Financial Aid Eligible Students are eligible for financial aid as long as they are enrolled in classes and they fall into one of the following categories: Students with no satisfactory academic progress issues Students who have appealed successfully and have successfully completed their warning/ probation period of enrollment Students who have successfully completed their warning/probation period of enroll - ment and are following their academic plan Students who have met satisfactory academic progress after being ineligibleTUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID 431 Financial Aid Warning The failure to make satisfactory academic progress. The student is still financial aid eli - gible for one period of enrollment and must make satisfactory academic progress by the end of that period of enrollment. If the student does not make satisfactory academic progress, financial aid eligibility will be placed on probation. Warning status is not appealable. Financial Aid Probation The failure to make satisfactory academic progress after a warning period. The student is eligible to appeal. If the appeal is approved, the student can continue financial eligibility for another period of enrollment under a suspended probationary status. Students may also choose not to appeal and attempt to regain financial aid eligibility by meeting satisfactory academic progress while paying out-of-pocket (without any financial aid). Financial Aid Suspended The failure to make satisfactory academic progress. The student appealed and was deter - mined to be financial aid eligible for the period designated in the granted appeal.Financial Aid Ineligible The failure to make satisfactory academic progress (this status also applies to appeals that are not approved). The student is not eligible for financial aid until cumulative satisfactory academic progress standards are met. The student may not appeal. Appeal Process There may be extenuating circumstances encountered by a student that may affect his/ her ability to be academically successful during an enrollment period. These circumstances include personal injury or illness that occurs during an enrollment period; death of an immediate family member or legal guardian during an enrollment period; or other docu - mented circumstances that were unexpected in nature and beyond the control of the stu - dent. In these cases, cumulative grade point average or completion rate may decline resulting in the student not meeting the minimum qualitative and quantitative standards previously described. If the student wishes to appeal the suspension from financial aid eligibility, a Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal form must be submitted to the Financial Aid Office. If the stu - dent is able to meet the satisfactory academic progress policy within one enrollment term, the financial aid administrator and the Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Rein - statement Contract needs to state the minimum grade point average and the number of credit hours that a student must obtain in order to be compliant at the next assessment period. A review will be done at the end of the quarter to ensure that the student is meeting the terms of the contract. If the student is not meeting those terms, further eligibility for aid is canceled immediately. Note: Before filing an appeal for reinstatement of financial aid, it is important that the student meet with an academic advisor and/or visits the Drahmann Advising and Learning Resource Center in order to explore ways of eliminating deficiencies and to establish a realistic plan towards graduation.432 TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID Appeal Denials Students whose appeal was not approved will receive information regarding other alter - natives available to them. Some options include: Continue enrollment at S anta Clara University without any financial assistance. Continue enrollment at Santa Clara University with the assistance of private loans. The Financial Aid Office can assist the student with additional information about private loans. Withdraw from Santa Clara University to make up a portion or all of the deficient units at another institution. IMPORTANT: The student will have to file an additional appeal to have aid reinstated once he/she has completed the required units and demon - strated the ability to continue at Santa Clara University without incurring additional deficiencies. Loss of Eligibility A student who has lost eligibility to participate in federal, state, and University aid pro - grams for reasons of academic progress can regain that eligibility only by enrolling at Santa Clara University at his/her own expense. The mere passage of time will not restore eligibility to a student who has lost eligibility for failure to make satisfactory academic progress. Stu-dents who have been dismissed from Santa Clara University for academic reasons, but who are subsequently readmitted are not automatically eligible to participate in federal, state, or institutional aid programs and will be placed on financial aid warning. Readmission deci - sions are separate from funding decisions. Regaining Eligibility Students who failed to meet satisfactory academic progress and who choose to enroll without financial aid may request a review of their academic record after any term in which they are enrolled without the receipt of financial aid. If the standards are met at the time of review, eligibility may be regained for subsequent terms of enrollment in the academic year. Study Abroad Programs Santa Clara University students participating in study abroad and domestic public sector study programs operated by or affiliated with the University are eligible for Santa Clara University financial aid and tuition remission as well as federal and state aid consistent with the policies and practices applicable to students enrolled for on-campus classes. T uition and room and board rates associated with the specific program will be factored into the determi - nation of the financial aid award consistent with applicable policies and practices. The total amount of tuition remission for the academic year cannot exceed the annual tuition rate for that year. Students with private scholarships should contact the donor for prior approval to use funds for study abroad or domestic study programs. Students from other colleges and universities enrolled in Santa Clara University study abroad programs are not eligible for Santa Clara University financial aid.TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID 433 Veterans and Veterans' Dependents Assistance Santa Clara University has been certified by the Department of Veterans Affairs as quali - fied to enroll students under applicable federal legislation and regulations, including Chap - ter 35 (child of a deceased or 100 percent disabled veteran, widow of any person who died in the service or died of a service-connected disability, or wife of a veteran with a 100 per- cent service-connected disability), Chapter 31 (rehabilitation), Chapter 30/1606 (active duty Montgomery G.I. Bill), and Chapter 33 (Post 9/11 GI Bill). Individuals interested in attending under any of the veteran's assistance programs should contact the Veterans Administration and the University Office of the Registrar. CANCELLATION OF FINANCIAL AID AND RETURN OF FUNDS Students who withdraw from the University and who have federal financial aid are sub - ject to the federal regulations applicable to the return of Title IV funds. These regulations assume that a student earns his or her financial aid based on the period of time he or she remains enrolled during a term. A student is obligated to return all unearned federal finan - cial aid funds governed under Title IV other than those earned under the college work-study program. Unearned financial aid is the amount of disbursed Title IV that exceeds the amount of Title IV aid earned in accordance with the federal guidelines. During the first 60 percent of the term, a student earns Title IV funds in direct proportion to the length of time he or she remains enrolled. That is, the percentage of time during the term that the student remains enrolled is the percentage of disbursable aid for that period that the student has earned. A student who withdraws after the 60 percent point of the enrollment term earns all Title IV aid disbursed for the period. The amount of tuition and other charges owed by the student plays no role in determining the amount of Title IV funds to which a withdrawn student is entitled. All funds must be returned to federal programs before funds are returned to state or University financial aid programs or to the student. The return of funds allocation will be made in the following order for students who have received Federal Title IV assistance: Unsubsidized William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Federal Direct PLUS Loan Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education Grant subsidized William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Federal Perkins Loan Other federal and state financial aid, private grants, and scholarships Federal Supplemental Opportunity Grant University grants and scholarships Federal Pell Grant434 TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID STUDENT VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION The United States Department of Education requires all institutions disbursing federal financial aid funds to verify the accuracy of the information students and their families submit as a basis for the award of aid. Santa Clara University complies with this requirement by participating in the Federal Quality Assurance Program. Each year, a percentage of stu - dents receiving federal financial aid funds are randomly selected for verification of the infor - mation on which their awards were based. Students selected for verification may be required to submit additional documents and verify information, such as household size and number of family members enrolled in college. The University reserves the right to request similar information for verification purposes for any student awarded aid and to verify the atten-dance of other children in college. Information collected may result in changes to a financial aid award and, in some cases, the repayment of funds already received. Failure to comply with the request for this information will result in the cancellation of financial aid funds. BILLING AND PAYMENT PROCEDURES STUDENT ACCOUNTS AND BILLING Students assume responsibility for all costs incurred as a result of enrollment at Santa Clara University and agree to abide by applicable University policies and procedures. Students may designate a third party (e.g., parent, family member, spouse) to be an authorized payer for their student account. That individual is authorized to access the stu - dent's billing statements and to make payments on the student's behalf. However, it is still the student's responsibility to make sure all financial obligations are completed by the pub-lished deadlines. Once authorization is completed, the authorized payer will be sent notifi-cation on the login process via the email address provided by the student. Authorized payers do not have access to any other student account information via this website. Students receive monthly bills electronically via a third-party vendor that are accessible through University eCampus. A billing notification will be sent to the student's University email address and to the email address of any payer authorized by the student. Students may also forward their billing statements electronically to any third party they authorize for remittance. Information on a student's account cannot be provided to any third party payer unless a completed Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act form authorizing its release by the student is on file with the University. Students are obligated to pay the applicable tuition and fees associated with their enroll - ment status by the published term payment deadline. Students enrolling after the initial payment deadline may be required to pre-pay for their enrollment. Registered students who do not withdraw formally from the University are responsible for all tuition and fees assessed to their account as well as any penalty charges incurred for nonpayment. Nonattendance does not relieve the student of his or her obligation to pay tuition and fees.TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID 435 PAYMENT METHODS Santa Clara University offers a variety of payment methods to students and their parents to assist with their financial obligations. Payment by Electronic Check A student or authorized payer may make online payments by authorizing a fund transfer directly from their personal checking or savings account through a third-party website accessible via the University eCampus system. The payer is able to make electronic check payments online without incurring a transaction fee. Payment by Mail Payments for student account charges are accepted by mail utilizing the University's cash management service lockbox. The payer should download a copy of the student's billing statement, enclose it with a personal or cashier's check payable to: Santa Clara University, and mail both to Santa Clara University Bursar's Office, P .O. Box 742657, Los Angeles, CA 90074-2657. Payment in Person Payments for student account charges may be made in person by cash or check only at the Enrollment Services Center located in the Admissions and Enrollment Services Building. The Office is not able to accept any electronic form of payment, including debit or credit cards. However, there are computer kiosks located in the Walsh Administration Building for the convenience of students and their payers who wish to make electronic payments. EXTENDED PAYMENT OPTIONS For students and their families wishing to spread payments over a period of time, the University offers term payment plans, which are available through the online billing system via eCampus. There is a modest fixed fee to enroll in these plans, but no interest is charged during the payment term. Information about these plans is available on the Bursar's Office website. DELINQUENT PAYMENTS If all charges on a student's account have not been cleared by payment, financial aid, or loan disbursement, a late payment fee will be assessed to the student's account and a hold will be placed on the student's record. A hold on a student's record prevents the release of transcripts or diplomas, prevents access to any registration services, and may limit access to other University services. Students who have unpaid accounts at the University or who defer payment without approval are subject to dismissal from the University. All unpaid balances will accrue 10 percent interest per annum on the balance remaining from the date of default in accordance with California state law. Delinquent student accounts may be reported to one or more of the major credit bureaus and may be forwarded to an outside collection agency or an attorney for assistance in recov - ering the debt owed to the University. The student is responsible for all costs incurred to collect outstanding debt, including but not limited to accrued interest, late fees, court costs, collection fees, and attorney fees. All outstanding bills and costs of collection incurred by the University must be paid in full prior to a student re-enrolling at the University.436 TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID BILLING DISPUTES If a student believes there is an error on his or her billing statement, a written explanation should be forwarded to: Santa Clara University, Bursar's Office, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053-0615. The Bursar's Office must receive written correspondence within 60 days from the billing statement date on which the error appeared. Communication can be made by telephone, but doing so will not preserve the student's rights. Communication should include the student's name, SCU identification number, the amount in question, and a brief explanation. Payment for the amount in question is not required while the investigation is in progress. An adjustment will be made on the student's account for any incorrect charges. If the amount in question is found to be valid, payment must be submitted to the Bursar's Office immediately upon notification. REFUND PAYMENTS Refunds will be granted only for student accounts reflecting a credit balance. A refund will not be granted based on anticipated aid. All financial aid must be disbursed into a stu-dent's account before a refund is processed. It is the student's responsibility to make sure that all necessary documentation is completed and submitted to the Financial Aid Office so that aid can be disbursed properly and in a timely fashion. Payment received by personal check will have a 21-day hold before a refund can be issued; a 5-day hold for electronic check payments. TUITION INSURANCE PROTECTION Students and their families may protect themselves against financial loss due to an unex - pected withdrawal from the University, for medical reasons, by purchasing tuition insurance coverage. The University has identified an insurance company, A.W.G. Dewar, Inc., to pro-vide an optional tuition insurance protection plan. This plan is designed to protect from loss of funds paid for tuition should it be necessary to withdraw completely from the Uni-versity during the term for medical reasons. Information on the tuition insurance plan is available from the Bursar's Office and on its website. EDUCATIONAL TAX CREDITS Students may be eligible for a higher education tax credit designed to help students and their parents finance the cost of education. Tax credits are based on the amount of qualified tuition and fees, less grants and other tax-free educational assistance, and the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. Students enrolled in an eligible degree program may qualify for a Hope Scholarship Credit or Lifetime Learning Tax Credit. Specific information is available from the Internal Revenue Service.43710 University Honor Societies and Awards HONOR SOCIETIES Santa Clara University is proud to host 24 prestigious national honor societies in the liberal arts, sciences, business administration, and engineering.

Campus Ministr y provides a welcoming environment where faith may be explored, discovered, and developed; a place where there is always someone to talk to about any - thing; and a place where people meet for small groups, prayer, reflection, and learning. More than 400 students attend weekly worship, and even more students are involved in Campus Ministry programs. In addition to eight full-time campus ministers, there are also resident ministers living in residence halls on campus. What does Campus Ministry have to offer?

The internships encourage students to develop their interest and skills in ministry. Retreats: Santa Clara students are offered a number of retreat experiences over the course of the academic year. Offerings include a silent retreat, Search retreats, an Ignatian retreat, and vocation discernment retreats. Retreats are offered to persons of all faiths.

In all, Santa Clara went to the tournament three times in Nash's four years on the Mission campus. In 2011, Santa Clara men's basketball returned to the postseason for the first time since Nash graduated and took part in the CollegeInsider.com Tournament. The Broncos, led by the nation's top three-point shooter, Kevin Foster, went all the way to collect the tourna - ment title. The women's basketball team has had success in the postseason as well, bringing home the 1991 Women's National Invitation Tournament (WNIT) championship. Not to be outdone, Bronco baseball has had tremendous success with the high point coming in 1962 when the team went all the way to Omaha and the College World Series title game. The team featured eight future major league players, including three that went straight from Santa Clara to the big leagues. One of the most famous Santa Clara baseball players, Randy Winn, started as Steve Nash's backup at point guard on the basketball team. Winn played 13 seasons in the major leagues including five for the San Francisco Giants. With a long tradition of turning out professional baseball players, the Broncos have had over 150 players taken in the major league baseball draft. The Broncos also have some of the best athletic facilities in the country including Stephen Schott Stadium that opened in 2005, the Sullivan Aquatic Center that opened in 2008, the Degheri Tennis Center that opened in 1999, and the Leavey Center that was renovated in 2002. Santa Clara is one of the WCC's top broad-based programs.
