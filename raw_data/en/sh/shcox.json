Up to now, a comprehensive review of the potential health and economic benefits on he patitis A vaccination in middle -income countries has not yet been performed. In this study, we reviewed the literature on the cost -effectiveness of hepatitis A vaccination in middle -income countries. Most of the studies confirmed that hepatitis A vaccinati on was cost -effective or even cost -saving under certain conditions. We found that vaccine price, medical costs, incidence and discount rate were the most influential parameters on the sensitivity analyses. Vaccine price has been shown as a barrier for midd le-income countries in implementing universal vaccination of hepatitis A. Given their relatively limited financial resources, implementation of single -dose vaccination could be considered. Despite our findings, we argue that further economic evaluations in middle -income countries are still required in the near future. Chapter 6 90 Introduction Despite the small percentage of patients with hepatitis A virus (HAV) with severe conditions and potentially death, HAV infection caused major economic losses in many parts of the world in recent decades [ 1]. HAV is a non -enveloped virus with positive -stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA), classified into the hepatoviru s genus of the picomavirus family [2,3 ], which can be transmitted from person to person, primarily by the faecal -oral route and the ingestion of contaminated food or drink [4 ]. Approximately 1.5 million cases of HAV infection occur annually with two different manifestation forms, usually asymptomatic in young children and mostly symptomatic in adults of which 85% re flect icteric symptoms [4,5,6 ]. The incidence rate of HAV is strongly and conversely correlated with the rising of socioeconomic status and the hygiene i mprovement of water resources [4,7,8 ]. Potentially, the most effective way to avoid HAV inf ection is th rough vaccination [9 ], which has been implemented in several countrie s, resulting in HAV reduction [10,11 ]. In 2000, the World Health Organization (WHO) started a campaign for the enhancement of hepatitis A vaccination programs by dividing regions based on three endemicity levels of HAV infection, i.e., (i) low -endemic, (ii) intermediate -endemic, and (iii) high -endemic [1 2]. The endemicity level of HAV infection in a country is related to its hygienic condition and its sanitary infrastructur e [13,14 ]. A pre vious study estimated that all high -income countries (HICs) have very low endemicity levels; most middle -income countries (MICs) have a mix of intermediate and low endemicity levels, and all low -income countries (LICs) have high endemicity levels of HAV [1 5]. In MICs with a mixture of intermediate and low prevalence, a substantial proportion of adolescents and adults is susceptible. As the severity of HAV infection increases with age, this might lead to a higher rate of severe conditions an d death [1 2]. Fur thermore, social developments (such as globalization, migration and travel patterns) increase the risk of transferring HAV from high -endemic (LICs) into intermediate -endemic (MICs) [16 ]. Therefore, it is relevant to evaluate the cost -effectiveness of hepat itis A vaccination programs in MICs, both regarding universal and targeted vaccination options. As a consequence of the increased role of economic evaluations in the last decade, systematic reviews of economic evaluations have become an essential tool in t he po licy making process recently [20 -22]. Up to now, a comprehensive review of the potential health and economic benefits of hepatitis A vaccination in MICs has not been performed, whereas this information is important to assist national and international policy makers in different jurisdictions on making effective and rational decisions related to hepatitis A vaccination. Importantly, MICs are unlikely to receive as much financial assistance on vaccination programs as LICs do, in Economic evaluations of hepatitis A vaccination in middle -income countries 91 the context of enhancing the re levance of economic analyses [20,21 ]. In this study, we review the literature on the cost -effectiveness of hepatitis A vaccination in MICs to evidence projected economic attractiveness of hepatitis A vaccination and possibly to provide recommendation s on promoting HAV vaccination in such countries. Methods Literature search We conducted a systematic search on January 7, 2013, to identify relevant articles in the last fifteen years (1998 -2012) on economic evaluations of hepatitis A vaccination in thr ee major databases: PubMed, Embase and LILACS. Reference lists were screened for title and abstract that included keywords. The search used variations of the following keywords: (hepatitis OR hepatitis A) AND (vaccin* OR immune*) AND (cost -minimi* OR cost -effectiveness OR cost - benefit OR cost -utility OR economic evaluation* OR economic analysis). Selection criteria In our study we used the following selection criteria regarding the topics: Study design should be complete economic evaluation, classified in one of the formal health -economic categories of cost -minimization analysis (CMA), cost -effectiveness analysis (CEA), cost -utility analysis (CUA) or cost -benefit analysis (CBA), being done in one of the MICs based on the country -classificati on data from the World Bank [23 ]. Type of intervention should be universal childhood or targeted hepatitis A vaccination program. Retrieved abstracts were independently screened by the research team (in particular, AAS and AR). We excluded incomplete economic evaluations, analyses of the combined hepatitis A/B vaccine, non -MICs' settings, systematic review studies, studies available in abstract only and studies which are not English. From the selected studies, we extracted both qualitative and quantitative data on title, a uthors, country, region (classified by the WHO), publication year, approach, sensitivity analysis, perspective, outcome, economic modeling, discount rates, vaccine costs, epidemiology of HAV, and vaccination strategies (universal or targeted). We classifie d studies into the four categories mentioned above: CMA, CEA, CUA or CBA. Economic results from the analyses were converted to 2012 US dollars by using purchasing power parities (PPPs) and deflators as measured by the annual growth rate in the country -specific GDP implicit deflator [24,25 ]. In the case when a study did not specify the year of cost, we assumed the year of cost would be the same as the year of publication. Chapter 6 92 Quality assessment The quality of reporting was summarized in accordance to the recomm endations by Beutels et al. on economic evaluations of viral he patitis vaccination programs [22 ], and a study by S. Polinder et al. on the quality assess ment of economic evaluations [26 ]. Appraisal items included study design, epidemiology estimates, vacci nation, cost components, outcome measures and results. We applied these items for all included papers, as shown in Table 1. Table 1 Criteria for assessing quality of economic evaluations [19,20] Study design Type of study Study perspective Discounting Time horizon of costs and benefits Epidemiology estimates Transparency on parameters used and assumptions Modeling study Vaccination Vaccination strategy Vaccination schedule Reporting of vaccine coverage Reporting of vaccine efficacy or vaccine effectiveness Reporting of annual rate of protective efficacy Cost components Reporting of direct medical, direct non -medical and indirect costs Reporting of productivity loss Reporting of vaccination cost Costing source Outcome measures Outcome measures stated Cost -effectiveness criteria Results ICERs (incremental cost -effectiveness ratios) Sensitivity analyses Results Literature search The search yielded 235, 153 and 108 articles in PubMed, Embase and LILACS, respectively. We identified 456 articles after removing 40 duplicated articles from all sources. We selected articles by applying further eligibility criteria that studies should be strictly classifiable in one of the formal health -economic ca tegories of CMA, CEA, CUA or CBA and having been done in one of the MICs based on the country -classification data from the World Bank [1]. We selected 19 articles after excluding 437 articles, of which 281 articles were clinical reports and epidemiological studies, 22 articles were focused on the combined vaccine, and 134 articles were not for MICs. From these 19 articles, we further excluded 10 articles as 6 articles were review studies, 3 articles were not written in English and 1 article was an incomplet e economic evaluation. In total, there were 9 studies for final review (see Figure 1). Economic evaluations of hepatitis A vaccination in middle -income countries 93 Figure 1. Flow chart for study selection Study site characteristics Our nine selected studies were from six different countries: Argentina (n=2), Brazil (n=1), Chile [27 -35]. Egypt represented lower - middle -income countries (GDP per capita: US$ 1,026 to US$ 4,035), while Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China and Thailand represented upper -middle -income countries (GDP per capit a: US$ 4,036 to US$ 12,475) [23 ]. From three levels of endemicity, only two levels were represented in this review, with seven studies in intermediate -endemic countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China and Egypt) and two studies in the lo w-endemic cou ntry (Thailand) [36,37 ]. The oldest paper that appeared from our search was from 2002, focusing on the CBA of hepatitis A vaccination in Thailand, and the most recent one was from 2012 addressing the CEA of universal childhood hepatitis A vaccination in Br azil. The most relevant aspects of these studies are summarized in Table 2.

Economic evaluations of hepatitis A vaccination in middle -income countries 95 Assessing economic evaluation quality Study design Based on the economic summary measures, one study was classified as CMA, four as CEAs, one as CUA, two as C BAs and one as mixed CEA -CUA [26,38,39]. Regarding the perspective, five studies adopted the societal perspective and four studies adopted both the societal and healthcare perspectives. The societal perspective includes direct medical costs ( e.g., medical cost of outpatient and inpatient care, fulminant hepatic failure with or without liver transplantation, and follow -up of transplantation), direct non -medical costs ( e.g., transportation, food, etc.), and indirect costs ( e.g., productiv ity loss in patient and caregivers), often preferred to reflect t he full public health impact [17, 40]. Compared to the societal perspective, the healthcare perspective only includes direct medical costs, which are relevant for assisting decision make rs in the health sector only [41 ]. Discounting deals with translating future values to current ones as the costs and consequences of a health technology generally might be sp read out over multiple years [38 ]. Notably, current costs of hepatitis A vaccination program need to be compared to future benefits of prevented disease and reduced healthcare costs. As summarized in Table 3, four studie s applied a 3% discount rate [28 -31] and two studies applied a 5% discount rate [27,32 ]. Two studies did not report any d iscount rate since the cost and effect in these studies were calculated only for one year [34,35 ] and another study did not specifica lly report any discount rate [33 ]. The majority of the studies (n=7) used a long time horizo n (24, 70, 72 and 100 years) [2 7-33] and only two studies used a short time horizon (1 year) [34,35 ]. Preference for a specific time horizon depends on the research question of the study, with time horizon potentially varying from a few weeks to several years or even the whole remaining life expectancy.

Based on the level of endemicity, Sartori et al . performed regional and nationwide CEAs [27 ] by applying hepatitis A seroprevalence data from nationwide population survey in Brazil and developing an age and time dependent susceptible -infectious -recovered -vaccinated (SIRV) dynam ic model. Valenzuela et al . presented the incidence data and conducted both regional and national analyses in Chile by modifying an existing Markov model and considering infection index at 0.142, 0.163, 0.107, 0.102, 0.126 and 0.930 for people at <6, 6-11, 12 -17, 18 -29, 30 -39 and 4 0-49 years old, respectively [28 ]. In the similar way, Ellis et al. estimated the number of hepatitis A infections in Argentina by taking proportions at 7%, 37%, 71%, 76% and 86% for individuals by age group at <5, 5 -9, 10 -14, 15 -49 and >49 years old [30 ]. In dynamic models, which incorporated the epidemiology changing and herd - immunity, Quezada et al. and Lopez et al. provided incidence cases and applied only nationwide CEAs in Chile and Argentina, respectively [29,31 ]. Using a Markov model, Zhuang et al . performed CEAs in five region in China: the lowest, lower, intermediate, higher and the highest prevalence regions by considering the anti -HAV prevalence values at the age of 12 months from the lowest to the highest i nfection region were 7.4%, 12.5%, 23.1%, 31.1% and 47.3%, annual decline of 2% [32 ]. Teppakdee et al. adjusted the incidence data in 3 age groups (3 -11, 12 -18, and 19 -40 years old) and conducted a nationwide CBA in Thailand by developing a Markov model and applying natural immunity of 9.4%, 15% and 70% for the th ree age groups, respectively [33 ]. Focusing only on a Thai adolescent group (12 -18 years old), Soogarun et al. conducted a CBA by considering vaccination strategy with or wi thout screening intervention [35 ]. El -Karaksy et al. carried out a study in 2004 in Egypt to analyze children with chronic liver disease (CLD) in a CMA study [34 ]. Most of the studies classifie d outcomes into four categories: outpatient cases (visits), inpatient cases, transplant ca ses, and deaths. Six studies [27 -32] used epidemiological data from a previou s study in the United States [37 ] to estimate the age -specific proportions of icteric cas es of developing jaundice during acute hepatitis A and three studies did not take this parameter into account [33 -35]. Additionally, four studies [29 -32] applied the US d ata related to case -fatality [42,43 ], and five studies used case -fatality data from na tional studies to perform their estimations [27,28,33 -35]. Most of the studies (n=6) applied static models, and only three studies applied dynamic models. Whereas its benefit is on potentially estimating more accurately, a dynamic model requires larger amo unts of data, such as data on the annual chang es in the force of infection Chapter 6 98 [29,31 ]. Comparing to static models, dynamic models are able to incorporate the epidemiology of hepatitis A, the development of herd immunity and potential age shifts incurred by th e vaccination [44 ]. Notably, in a dynamic model, the probability of an individual to be infected depends on the contact with others and the distribution of infections in the population [45 ]. In our review, herd immunity was consid ered in three dynamic mode ls [27,29,31 ] and partially included in one static model [28 ]. Considering herd immunity in the economic evaluation enhances the accuracy of cost -effectiveness of the vaccination program because the number of prevented cases would be captured more rigorous ly [46 ], although any age shift modeled in the dynamics might impact oppositely. Vaccination Depending on the level of endemicity and the fund availability for implementing hepatitis A vaccination, universal or targeted v accination can be considered [47 ]. We identified eight studies on universal hepatitis A vaccination programs and only one study in Egypt analyzed targeted vacc ination of children with CLD [34 ]. Prevention of HAV infection by universal vaccination has long been acknowledged to effectively reduce healthcare costs related to the disease and the effectiveness of universal HAV vaccination has been confirmed in many countries [29,31,48 -51]. Implementing targeted hepatitis A vaccination is, however, still debatable regarding its effectiveness, in particular regarding its validity in adequately and completely targeting the groups of major interest [52 -56]. All studies evaluated two doses vaccination strategies [27 -35]. One study evaluated both one-dose and two -dose vaccination strategies [30 ]. Most studies considered vaccination of children up to 24 months of age and only two studies evaluated the strategy with a second dose at 54 and 72 months of age [28 ,30]. Three studies did not specify the vaccination schedule [33 -35]. For vaccination coverage, six studies applied v accine coverage of 66.5% - 95% [27 -32], and three studies did not specify the coverage [33 -35]. Vaccine effectiveness was presented in several studies (n=8), ranging from 93 -98% and 94 -100% for first dose and second dose, respectively [2 7-33,35 ]. One study did not specifically report vaccine effic acy or vaccine effectiveness [34 ]. Only five studies considered the annual rate of decrease in protecti ve efficacy in their studies [28 -32]. Three studies [28,30,32 ] used data from a previou s stu dy in the United States [42 ], which was constructed by an expert panel. For the first 10 years, they applied an annual rate of decrease in protective efficacy at 1.62% and 0.31% for first dose and second dose, respectively, and after 10 years they applied increasing annual waning rates at 2.67% and 0.62% for first dose a nd second dose, respectively [42]. Two studies [29,31 ] used an Economic evaluations of hepatitis A vaccination in middle -income countries 99 annual waning rate of seroprotection after vaccination at 0.58% by incorporating the seroprevale nce data from the late 1990s [57] and the early 2000s [58 ]. Four studies did not take any decrease in the annual rate of prot ective efficacy into account [27,33 -35] (see Table 4).

One study only i ncluded direct medical costs [34 ] and five studies included both direc t medical and indirect costs [28 -32]. In the majority of studies, direct medical cost components were the medical cost of hepatitis A outpatient and inpatient care, fulminant hepatic failure with or without liver transplantation, and follow -up of transplantation. Most of the studies (n=8) used national data to estimate direct medical costs and only one study [29] applied international data to estimate direct medical costs. Bas ed on previous studies in US [59 ], Valenzuela et al . and Ellis et al. considered the lifetime cost of graft maintenance for liver transplant patients, which was estimated to cost more than the transplant procedure itself [28,30 ]. Among eight studies, w hich included indirect costs [27 -33,35 ], five studies calcu lated the productivity loss due t o HAV infection for patients [28,30,32,33,35 ], while two studies also included the productivity los s of caregivers [27,29 ]. Additionally, the productivity losses in five studies were calculated by incorporating the daily gr oss-wage -rate in each country [27 -31]. Furthermore, three studies used per -capita gross domestic product (GDP) to estimate the work los s costs due to HAV infection [32,33,35 ]. Sartori et al . estimated the number of lost workdays of 15 days and 24 -30 days f or outpatients and inpatients, respectively [27 ]. Zhuang et al . determined work loss durations of 16, 33 and 40 days for non -hospitalized, hospitalized and ultimately fatal cases, respecti vely, in their CEA -CUA study [32 ]. Valenzuela et al. and Ellis et al . argued that the mean duration o f work loss would be 28 days [28,30 ], based on st udies from the United States [60] and Israel [45 ]. Quezada et al. e s t i m a t e d w o r k l o s s o f 3 a n d 2 5 d a y s f o r p a t i e n t 1 5 y e a r s o l d a n d older patients, respectively [29 ]. Teppak dee et al. and Soogarun et al. conservatively assumed that the work -day-loss were due to hospitalization period only [33,35 ]. Lopez et al. did not specify the indirect costs due to HAV infection in their study [31 ]. Regarding the v accination cost, all stud ies [27 -35] included the vaccine pri ce per dose and five studies [27 -30,32 ] additionally included the administration cost. Most of the studies did not consider costs of potential adverse events (AE) after hepatitis A vaccination since AEs are generally mil d and it might be insignificant. Only one study took the vaccine cost related to AEs into account [29 ] (see Table 5).

The majority of the studies (n=7) confirmed that the implementation of hepatitis A vaccination would be a Chapter 6 102 cost -effective intervention [27 -32,34]. Moreover, four studies estimated that vaccination would be a cost -saving interv ention [27,28,30,32 ]. All CBAs confirmed that vaccination would not be an actual cost beneficial intervention [33,35 ]. Regarding the cost -effectiv eness criteria, five stud ies [28 -32] used a conventional consideration that an intervention would be cost -effective if the ICER does not exceed the GDP per capita [61 ]. Only one study [27 ] used the WHO's definition on cost -effectiveness of universal immunization according to the GDP per capita, whether an intervention would be highly co st-effective (less than one GDP per capita), cost -effective (between 1 and 3 times GDP per capita) or cost -ineffective (more than 3 times GDP per capita) [ 62]. Other three studies did not apply the cost -effectiveness criteria as t hey were CMA and CBA studies [33 - 35]. Interpretation of results Table 6 presents the results of studies. Sartori et al. showed that universal childhood hepatitis A vaccination would be a cost -saving strategy in intermediate and low endemic regions and Brazil in general from both the healthca re and societal perspectives [27 ]. The result was in line with a similar previous study in the context of comparing the current strategy (vaccination of high -risk groups) with universal v accin ation [63 ]. In the absence of Brazilian guidelines on cost -effectiveness, Sartori et al. used the WHO criteria for cost - effectiveness of universal immunization and the GDP per capita as the threshold [27,64 ]. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the pr oportion of icteric cases and the outpatient costs were the most influential on the incremental cos t-effectiveness ratio (ICER) [22 ]. The vaccine price per dose also ha d a major impact on the ICER [27 ]. Even with an increase of 50% of vaccine in the base -case, vaccination remained a cost -saving intervention. Notably, compared to other cost -effectiveness studies of new vaccines (rotavirus, varicella, pneumococcal and meningococcal C conjugate) in Brazil, only hepatitis A vaccination could be confirmed as a cost-saving intervention [38,65,66 ].

Chapter 6 104 In two CBAs from 2002, Soogarun et al. and Teppakdee et al. concluded that vaccination against HAV in Thailand, a low -incidence country, would not be a cost -beneficial intervention [33,35 ]. Comparing two scenarios (vaccination with or without screening), which focused only on the adolescent group (12 -18 years old) , Soogarun et al. confirmed that hepatitis A vaccination would not be a cost -beneficial intervention in Thailand under all scenarios [35 ]. Notably, no vaccination was more beneficial than vaccination with or without screening strategies [35 ]. Differing fro m a study conducted by Soogarun et al. , Teppakdee et al. conducted a CBA study in three age -groups: 3 -11, 12 -18 and 19 -40 years old [33 ]. Nevertheless, the vaccination strategies were still not cost -benefici al in all of those scenarios [33]. Teppakdee et al. carried out sensitivity analyses and confirmed that the incidence rate and the vaccine price were the most critical parameters [33 ]. Valenzuela et al. compared three vaccination strategies in Chile: vaccination at 18 and 24 months, at 18 and 5 4 months, and no vaccination [28 ]. Compared to no vaccination, vaccination would cost US$ 431and US$ 241 per QALY gained for vaccination at 18 and 24 months and at 18 and 54 months, respectively from the healthcare perspective, while from the societal perspective it would be cost -saving fo r both vaccination schedules [28 ]. In the context of cost -effectiveness criteria, this study used a conventional consideration that an intervention would be cost -effective if the ICER does n ot exceed the GDP per capita [28,61 ]. Usin g the GDP per capita in 2012 of US$ 15,363, vaccination would be considered as a cost - effectiveness intervention, even without considering the work loss in the societal perspective [28]. Sensitivity analyses were carried out from the healthcare perspective . It appeared that the ICER was most sensitive to the discount rate, med ical costs and vaccine price [28 ]. Quezada et al. estimated that a two -dose vaccination (12 and 18 months) program for toddlers in Chile would sa ve US$ 3,625 per QALY gained [29 ]. This study analyzed that the total costs (direct costs, indirect costs and vaccination costs) would increase temporarily for 5 years; and both direct and indirect costs wou ld decrease thereafter [29 ]. This would make vaccination a cost -saving program after 6 y ears and within 8 years, even if indire ct costs were not considered [29 ]. Sensitivity analyses confirmed that vaccination coverage, time horizon, annual decrease on force of infection, discount rate, herd immunity and disease costs were the most influentia l parameters. Applying the best -case assumptions, vaccination would annually save US$ 13,575,133 and 3,745 life years for the cohort of toddlers of 12 to 18 months [29 ]. Additionally, the break -even price per dose of hepatitis A vaccine in the base case wa s US$ 35 f rom the societal perspective [29 ]. In Ellis et al. , three vaccination strategies were compared to no vaccination: vaccination at (i) 12 months, (ii) 12 and 18 months , and (iii) 12 and 72 months [30 ]. The study was Economic evaluations of hepatitis A vaccination in middle -income countries 105 conducted in five regions in Arg entina: Northeast, Centra l, South, Cuyo and Northwest [30 ]. The study showed that the ICERs would be at cost -saving, US$ 401 and US$ 690 per QALY gained for vaccination at 12 months, at 12 and 18 months, and at 12 and 72 months , respectively, in Argentina [30]. Comparing the different levels of endemicity, the ICERs would be at cost -saving, US$ 489 and US$ 2,016 per QALY gained in Cuyo (high endemicity), South (intermediate endemicity) and Northeast (low endemicity), respectively, when the vaccination at 12 and 18 months was implemented [30 ]. Ellis et al. used a threshold for cost - effectiveness expressing that medical interventions are conventionally considered a cost - effective strategy if the ICER does n ot exceed the GDP per capita [30,61 ]. Considering the GDP per capita in 2012 of US$ 11,558, vaccination would be accepted as a cost -effective intervention in all regions in Argentina. An increase of 10% and 20% of vaccine prices with protection waning at half and twice the rate in base -case, vaccination remai ned a cost - effective intervention [30 ]. Notably, the implementation of single -dose hepatitis vaccination was the most cost -effective intervention in this study. Implementing the two -doses vaccination program at 12 and 18 months in Argentina, Lopez et al. estimated that vaccination would sa ve US$ 2,838 per QALY gained [31 ]. It would substantially reduce the direct and indirect costs within 10, 20 and 50 years of time [31 ]. The treatment costs, discount rate, level of herd immunity, and decreasing rate on for ce of infection were va ried in sensitivity analyses [31 ]. Cost savings remained in these alternative calculations. In particular, the break -even cost per dose of hepatitis A vaccine in the base - case was US$ 21 [31 ], which was four times higher than the current vaccine price of US$ 5. Zhuang et al. compared the cost -effectiveness of vaccination (at 12 and 18 months) to no vaccination in five regions based on anti -HAV prevalence: the lowest, lower, intermediate, higher and the highest infectious region, co vering 31 provinces of Mainland China [32 ]. Vaccination would be cost -saving in the lowest, lower, intermediate, higher and highest infectious regions from both the healthcare a nd the societal perspectives [32 ]. Yet, in the highest infectious region vaccin ation would require additional costs at US$ 149 and US$ 201 per QALY gained from the healthcare and the societa l perspectives, respectively [32 ]. In sensitivity analyses, varying several parameters within the plausible ranges still indicated vaccinatio n co st-saving in all regions [32 ]. The study in Egypt was the only one study focusing on a specific, targeted g roup, i.e., children with CLD [34 ]. Considering the test cost for anti -HAV at US$ 6 per test and the vaccine price per dose at US$ 15, the study conc luded that children with CLD>2 years old are recommended to be vaccinated to prevent serious complications from superimposed liver insult on their diseased livers at accept able cost -effectiveness [34 ]. It confirmed the result Chapter 6 106 from a previous study in the U nited States that hepatitis A vaccination in peo ple with CLD was recommended [67 ]. Additionally, it showed that pre -screening in the group of children with CLD >5 years old would be cheaper than in the group of children with CLD <5 years old [34]. Discuss ion Our systematic review suggests that universal hepatitis A vaccination of infants, chi ldren and adolescents in MICs is cost -effective in the intermediate -endemic countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China and Egypt, were investigated in detail). In thos e countries, universal vaccination is economically attractive since people are mostly infected during the childhood, the disease is asymptomatic and a large proportion of the adult population is relatively susceptible to HAV. In contrast, for a low -endemic country (Thailand), as infection might occur only among specific risk groups (such as travelers), a large -scale vaccination program is unlikely to be cost -effective. Incidence is one of the major factors, which determine the cost -effectiveness results. In particular, two studies in Thailand confirmed that immunization against HAV was not cost -beneficial since HAV infections might lead to outbreaks only occasionally [33,35 ]. For targeted vaccination, economic attractiveness is obviously more likely to be in fluenced by the level of risk in the target group and less dependent on the full population (except if investigated as an intervention to reduce the spread of infections in dynamic models) [18 ]. The majority of the studies confirmed that vaccine price, med ical costs, incidence and discount rate were the most influential parameters in the sensitivity analyses. A change in these parameters would give a significant effect on the ICERs in both societal and healthcare perspectives. Notably, these findings are congruent with other economic studies of hepatitis A vaccination [18,20,41 ]. Most of the studies on economic evaluations of hepatitis A immunization in MICs confirmed that hepatitis A immunization is cost -effective or even cost -saving under certain condition s. It has been shown that for MICs, it is very essential to make an appropriate design and infrastructure related to the HAV vaccine delivery and acquisition policies in order to implement hepatitis A vaccination effectively, since MICs are unlikely to rec eive financial assistance on vaccination program as much as LICs. Before its widespread introduction, many factors should still be considered regarding HAV vaccination. Firstly, the disease burden related to HAV is an essential factor in the priority deter mination for new and under -used vaccines to be introduced into the national immunization programs (NIP), especially for policy makers in MICs with limited immunization budget and financial assistance. In a MIC with a relatively higher level of endemicity, it would be more urgent to Economic evaluations of hepatitis A vaccination in middle -income countries 107 introduce universal hepatitis A vaccination. Secondly, cost -effectiveness should be applied to determine the price at which hepatitis A vaccination should be introduced into the NIP. Most of the studies in this study confirmed that vaccine price is the most important factor influencing the cost -effectiveness results. Finally, health system characteristics (immunization schedule, vaccine security, possibility of local vaccine and cost) present critical factors whether the proposed intervent ion can be accepted in a MIC [68 ]. Potentially, introducing a new vaccine into the NIP would require a new infrastructure in the healthcare system of the considered MI C [69 ]. In conclusion, the ICERs from various studies are useful to summarize the cost - effectiveness of hepatitis A vaccination programs. Several limitations were found in the review. Applying a static model instead of using a dynamic model tends to underestimate the cost -effectiveness result. The majority of the studies applied static models or straightforward calculations without a formal model design, and only three studies applied dynamic models. Due to the ability to incorporate the epidemiology of hepatitis A and the development of herd immunity, dynamic models are generally preferred in the cost -effectiveness analysis for vaccination strategies. For applying static models, an exception might occur when the vaccine coverage is almost 100% and herd immunity mig ht validly be excluded. However, implementation of 100% vaccine coverage is unlikely for vaccination strategies in MIC. Most of the studies did not apply a dynamic model in this review, possibly because it required larger amounts of data, which were not av ailable in these MICs, and as static models indicate favorable cost -effectiveness, results from dynamic models would be cost -effective. Applying the discount rate for costs and health effects at the same rate is another methodological issue highlighted in this review. Despite the majority of the recent studies applying the same discount rate for health effects and costs at 3% -5%, the practice is debatable. Previously, it was conservatively argued by health economists that costs and health effects should be discounted at the same rate [70,71 ]. Weinstein et al. argued that the opportunity of individuals to transform income into health could only happen if costs and health effects wer e discounted at the same rate [ 72]. On the other hand, Gravelle et al. argued that health effects should be discounted at a lower rate if health effects are measured in quantities ( e.g., QALYs) because the value of health effects increases over time [70 ]. Also, WHO recommended that costs and health effects should be discounted at the same rate, yet considering a lower discount rate of health effects in the sensitivity analyses [73 ]. Notably, it is highly worthwhile to consider a lower discount rate for health effects in sensitivity analyses since this may heavily impact results [73]. Such differential discounting would help policy makers in implementing health interventions more appropriately related to the Chapter 6 108 relative valuation of future life and QALYs. Notably, only five studies in this review applied a lower discount rate for health e ffects in the sensitivity analyses [27 -29,31,32 ]. Another limitation concerns the productivity loss data related to caregivers. Only two studies considered the productivity loss for caregivers. Brouwer et al. argued that the effects of treatments on family members should be incl uded in economic evaluations [74 ]. Economic evaluations are designed to inform policy maker about the most appropriate healthcare intervention. As rec ommended in such evaluations [74,75 ], applying the societal perspective takes all r elevant costs and effects into account. Absence of productivity (or even QALY) losses related to caregivers might yield non -optimal decisions considering overall welfare [76]. A further limitation is associated with the lack of data. In the absence of data on the age - specific proportions of icteric cases, most of studies used US data associated with the epidemiological estimates. Also, four studies applied the US data related to case -fatality, in the absence of local data. Additionally, applying the dynamic model designs in their studies, Quezada et al. and Lopez et al. made an assumption that the force of infection would decrease at an annual rate of 1% in the base case, again in the absence of actual local data. However, the authors varied their estimates extensively in multiple sensitivity analysis in their studies to overcome those limitations . Regarding the resource limitations in MICs, implementation of single -dose vaccination could be considered and the schedule of hepatitis A vaccination should be chosen based on the schedule of other vaccines, which are alrea dy incorporated into the NIP [30 ]. Obviously, vaccine price has been shown as a strong barrier for MICs in implementing universal vaccination of hepatitis A since MICs are unlikely to receive health budgets as HICs do and financial aids from international organizations as LICs do. Despite all studies in this review confirmed that the implementation of hepatitis A vaccination at the base -case would be a cost -effective intervention, saving funds could enhance the implementation of other vaccination programs in MICs. Thus, the most fea sible solution to overcome this problem is through negotiations with the vaccine manufacturing companies to achieve discount prices and using the existing infrastructure for the introduction of new vaccines, such as existing self-sustaining storage, to min imize the required budget. Additionally, using the combined hepatitis A/B vaccine instead of monovalent vaccines could be considered to reduce the administration costs and it might be a solution to produce more favorable cost -effectiveness ratios. Indeed, the combined hepatitis A/B vaccine has proved to be a highly immunogeni c and well -tolerated vaccine [77 ] and in many studies it has been confirmed as a more cost - effective intervention compare d to the monovalent vaccines [78 -80]. Economic evaluations of hepatitis A vaccination in middle -income countries 109 From this review, it can b e concluded that hepatitis A immunization in MICs is generally cost -effective both from the healthcare and societal perspectives, due to savings of the future treatment cost from HAV infection, especially in the intermediate and high endemic countries. The result confirms that immunization is cost -effective next to an effective way to prevent HAV infection. Yet, further high -quality economic evaluations in MICs are still required in the near future. Hopefully, the results of this study could help national a nd international policy makers in making effective decisions related to the implementation of hepatitis A immunization programs in MICs. Expert commentary As countries with a mixture of intermediate and low endemic levels, MICs might experience an increa sed clinical incidence and fatal cases due to the high risk on transferring HAV infection from high -endemic (LICs) into intermediate -endemic (MICs). In this case, universal hepatitis A immunization is likely to be even more cost -effective in most of MICs. To control community -wide outbreaks, a single dose of hepatitis A vaccine has been proven an effective strategy if vaccination was started early and applied with high coverage. Compared to the two-dose schedule, single doses of vaccine are less expensive a nd easier to implement. However, in high -risk groups (such as children with CLD and immune -compromised individuals) for hepatitis A, a two -dose schedule is preferred. In MICs with low endemicity, targeted vaccination of high -risk groups should be considere d although the hepatitis A vaccine in high -risk groups has been associated with lower efficacy and shorter durations of protection, compared to vaccinating a healthy young population. Additionally, vaccination against HAV infection should be part of a comp rehensive plan related to both prevention and control of HAV. It should be integrated into the NIP schedule for children 1 year based on age-specific epidemiological and cost -effectiveness considerations. The decision to implement HAV immunization program s in MICs is definitely influenced by two major factors: the incidence of acute HAV infection and the vaccine price. Five -year view Due to its generally attractive characteristics on financial capability, high -quality economic evaluations of HAV immunizat ion in MICs have to be conducted in different settings in the next 5 years to support rational implementation in these settings. For instance, the cost - effectiveness of the combined hepatitis A/B immunization has to be urgently evaluated, especially as a s olution to reduce the administration costs and so yielding more cost -effective Chapter 6 110 intervention. Although, the price of the combined hepatitis A/B vaccine is higher compared to the prices of the monovalent vaccines, the initial higher cost would be covered in the future by its capabilities on generating savings on the direct and indirect costs of HAV and HBV. Furthermore, the decision makers in MICs have to design the best strategy to spend health budgets effectively with a main barrier of limited financial ass istance from international organizations for those MICs. Collaboration with research communities, both national and international, is required to conduct an ideal intervention/implementation of HAV immunization in MICs. Key issues Approaches to conduct ec onomic evaluations of hepatitis A vaccination in MICs varied widely and we found that several studies did not completely fulfill the criteria on quality assessment. We found evidence that universal hepatitis A vaccination of infants, children and adolescen ts in MICs has favorable cost -effectiveness in high - and intermediate -endemic countries and potentially unfavorable in low -endemic countries. Vaccine price, medical costs for HAV, incidence and discount rates were found as the most influential parameters i n the sensitivity analyses. Implementation of a single -dose hepatitis A vaccine has been proven to potentially be a cost -saving intervention in one of MICs.
