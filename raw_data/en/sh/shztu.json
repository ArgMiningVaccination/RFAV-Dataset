We tested the hypothesis that vaccination against VZV would de-crease the incidence, severity, or both of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgiaamong older adults. methods We enrolled 38,546 adults 60 years of age or older in a randomized, double-blind,placebo- controlled trial of an vaccine (\"zoster vaccine\"). Herpes zoster was diagnosed according to clinical and laboratorycriteria. The pain and discomfort associated with herpes zoster were measured repeat-edly for six months. The primary end point was the burden of illness due to herpes zoster, a measure affected by the incidence, severity, and duration of the associated painand discomfort. The secondary end point was the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia. results More than 95 percent of the subjects continued in the study to its completion, with amedian of 3.12 years of surveillance for herpes zoster. A total of 957 confirmed cases ofherpes zoster (315 among vaccine recipients and 642 among placebo recipients) and107 cases of postherpetic neuralgia (27 among vaccine recipients and 80 among place- bo recipients) were included in the efficacy analysis. The use of the zoster vaccine re-duced the burden of illness due to herpes by 61.1 percent (P<0.001), reduced theincidence of inci-dence of herpes zoster by 51.3 percent (P<0.001). Reactions at the injection site were more frequent among vaccine recipients but were generally mild. conclusions The zoster vaccine markedly reduced morbidity from herpes zoster and postherpeticneuralgia among older adults. n engl j med 352;22 www.nejm.org june 2 , 2005 The new england journal of medicine 2272erpes zoster, or shingles, is characterized by unilateral radicular pain and a vesicular rash that is generally lim- ited to a single within the sensory ganglia. 3,4 The incidence and severity of herpes zoster increase with advanc-ing age; more than half of all persons in whom her-pes zoster develops are older than 60 years. Compli-cations occur in almost 50 percent of older persons with herpes zoster. 3-5 The most frequent debilitat- ing complication is postherpetic neuralgia, a neuro-pathic pain syndrome that persists or develops afterthe dermatomal rash has healed. 5-9 The frequency and severity of postherpetic neuralgia also increasewith increasing age. 9-11 The pain and discomfort as- sociated with herpes zoster can be prolonged and disabling, diminishing the patient's quality of lifeand ability to function to a degree comparable to thatin diseases such as congestive heart failure, myocar-dial infarction, diabetes mellitus type 2, and major depression. 12 Antiviral therapy reduces the severity and duration of herpes zoster but does not preventthe development of postherpetic neuralgia. 2,11 Postherpetic neuralgia may persist for years and is often refractory to treatment. 13 Forty years ago, Hope-Simpson proposed that immunity to VZV plays a pivotal role in the patho-genesis of herpes zoster, 3 and subsequent observa- tions support the thesis that cell-mediated immu-nity to VZV is a major determinant of the risk andseverity of herpes zoster. 3,7,11,14-17 Whereas levels of antibody to VZV remain relatively constant withincreasing age, the increased incidence and sever-ity of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgiaamong older adults are effectively \"immunizing\" 3,4,7,8,22 Previous studies have shown that VZV vaccines can elicit a significant increase in cell-mediatedimmunity to VZV in immunocompetent olderadults 21-25 and reduce the incidence and severity of herpes zoster in recipients of bone marrow al-lografts. 26,27 These observations led us to hypothe- size that immunization of older persons with a VZVvaccine would boost their cell-mediated immunityto VZV and thereby provide against her-pes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia. 22 The Shin-gles Prevention Study (Department of VeteransAffairs [VA] Cooperative Study No. 403) was con-ducted to determine whether vaccination with a liveattenuated VZV vaccine would decrease the inci-dence, severity, or both of herpes zoster and post- herpetic neuralgia in adults 60 years of age or older. A detailed description of the methods used in this study is provided in the Supplementary Appendix(available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org). A brief overview is presented here. study design We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled,double-blind clinical trial at 22 sites, in which adults60 years of age or older received either VZV vaccineor placebo. The study was approved by a humanrights committee of the VA Cooperative Studies Pro-gram (VA CSP) and by the local institutional review boards at all study sites. An independent data andsafety monitoring board reviewed the safety dataand the interim results. study population Eligible subjects had a history of varicella or had re-sided in the continental United States for at least 30years. Immunocompromised persons and thoseunable to adhere to the study protocol were ex-cluded. All subjects provided written informedconsent. intervention Subjects received one subcutaneous injection of 0.5ml of the investigational live attenuated Oka/MerckVZV vaccine (\"zoster vaccine\") or placebo. The esti-mated potency at vaccination of the 12 vaccine lotsused in the study ranged from 18,700 to 60,000plaque-forming units per dose. The median poten-cy was 24,600 plaque-forming units, and more than90 percent of vaccinated subjects received 32,300plaque-forming units or less. follow-up Active follow-up and ascertainment of cases of herpes zoster were ensured by an interactive auto- mated telephone-response system, which subjectscalled monthly. If a subject's responses to a stan-dardized set of questions suggested a possible case of herpes zoster, the subject was instructed to con-tact the local study site immediately, and a fax con-h methods n engl j med 352;22 www.nejm.org june 2, 2005 efficacy of a varicella-zoster virus vaccine 2273 taining the subject's response was sent to the site. Subjects who did not call the automated tele-phone-response system within a pre-establishedlength of time were called by the automated tele-phone-response system. If this effort to reach the subject failed, the local study site was notified by fax to contact the subject directly. At the end of thestudy, subjects were asked to report any previouslyunreported episodes of herpes zoster. safety evaluation All adverse events occurring within 42 days aftervaccination were recorded. Thereafter, only seriousadverse events were recorded if reported by the sub-ject and considered by the study physician to be re- lated to the vaccination. Deaths were identified onthe basis of reports from family members and dur-ing follow-up of missed monthly calls to the auto-mated telephone-response system. Approximately 300 subjects at each of the study sites were enrolled in a substudy that more closelymonitored adverse events. These subjects main-tained a daily log of body temperature and a \"report card\" of symptoms related to the injection site and other clinical symptoms during the 42 days aftervaccination. Thereafter, they were followed to iden-tify all hospitalizations. identification and evaluation of suspected cases of herpes zoster At enrollment, the subjects were educated with re- gard to the signs and symptoms of herpes zoster.Those who had a new rash or new unilateral painwere urged to contact their study site immediately.Study personnel attempted to evaluate all subjectswith new rashes as soon as possible. Subjects withunilateral rashes and no alternative clinical diag-noses were classified as having \"suspected cases ofherpes zoster\" and were followed according to thestudy protocol. The evaluating physician offeredsubjects with clinically diagnosed herpes zoster,without cost, the licensed antiviral drug famciclovir (Famvir, SmithKline Beecham and Novartis Phar-maceuticals), in accordance with the manufactur- er's recommendations, and with standard-of-caretreatment for pain. Pain management was not spec-ified by the study protocol. Herpes zoster-associated pain (including un- pleasant sensations such as allodynia and pruritus,which are not always characterized as pain by per-sons with herpes zoster) was measured with the useof the Zoster Brief Pain Inventory, an assessmenttool in the form of a questionnaire completed bythe subject that was specifically designed to mea-sure pain and discomfort in herpes zoster. 28 This questionnaire and others 29,30 were used to assess the effect of herpes zoster on the subjects' activitiesof daily living, quality of life, and general healthstatus. Characteristics of the rash, associated complications, and medication use were also re-corded. Evaluations based on responses to thequestionnaires were repeated over a period of atleast 182 days, according to a schedule specified bythe study protocol. Digital photographs and speci-mens for laboratory diagnosis were obt ained from subjects with suspected cases of herpes zoster. confirmation of cases Before unblinding, each suspected case of herpeszoster was classified as a confirmed case of herpeszoster or as not a confirmed case with the use of ahierarchical algorithm that incorporated the resultsof the polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay per-formed at the central laboratory of the study, virusculture at the local virology laboratory, and the finalclinical diagnosis of the study's clinical evaluationcommittee, consisting of five physicians with ex-pertise in herpes zoster. The PCR assay, designed to detect among DNA wild-type and from herpes simplex virus (HSV), coulddetect approximately 13 copies of DNA from wild-type or the vaccine strain of VZV . The PCR assaysincluded primers and a probe for the human beta-globin gene to verify the presence of cellular DNAin the specimens from the lesions. If the PCR assay revealed VZV DNA, the suspect- ed case of herpes zoster was classified as a con-firmed case; if the assay was positive for beta-globinor HSV DNA and negative for VZV DNA, the casewas classified as not a case of herpes zoster. If thespecimen obtained for the assay was inadequate(i.e., was negative for both viral and beta-globinDNA) or was missing, the final diagnosis was de-termined by the isolation of VZV or HSV in the local virology laboratory. In the absence of a valid labo-ratory diagnosis, the case was classified on the ba-sis of the clinical diagnosis by the clinical evaluationcommittee. efficacy end points The primary end point was the burden of illnessdue to herpes zoster, a severity-by-duration measureof the total pain and discomfort associated with her- n engl j med 352;22 www.nejm.org june 2 , 2005 The new england journal of medicine 2274 pes zoster in the population of study subjects. 28,31,32 For each confirmed case of herpes zoster, responses to the \"worst pain\" question in the Zoster Brief PainInventory were used to calculate a herpes-zoster se-verity-of-illness score, defined as the area under thecurve (AUC) of herpes-zoster pain plotted againsttime during the 182-day period after the onset ofrash. Subjects in whom herpes zoster developed hadseverity-of-illness scores ranging from 0 to 1813. Increasing mean scores are highly correlated witha decrease in the health-related quality of life and in functional status among older adults. 28,33 A score of 0 was recorded for subjects in whom herpeszoster did not develop during the study period. The \"herpes-zoster burden-of-illness score\" rep- resented the average severity of illness among all subjects in the vaccine or placebo groups; it wascalculated as the sum of the herpes-zoster severity-of-illness scores of all members of a group dividedby the total number of subjects in the group. Thesecondary end point was the incidence of posther-petic neuralgia, defined as pain associated with her-pes zoster that was rated as 3 or more on a scaleranging from 0 (\"no pain\") to 10 (\"pain as bad asyou can imagine\"), persisting or appearing morethan 90 days after the onset of rash. Scores lowerthan 3 were not associated with significant decre-ments in the quality of life or the ability to carry outactivities of daily living and were therefore not con-sidered to represent postherpetic neuralgia. 10,28 statistical analysis A data-analysis plan was completed before thedata were unblinded for analysis. 31,34-38 The analy- sis was performed by the VACSP coordinating center(West Haven, Conn.), with review and approval bythe executive committee of the study. Vaccine effi-cacy with respect to the burden of illness due toherpes zoster (VE BOI ) was defined as the relative re- duction in the burden-of-illness score in the vaccinegroup as compared with that in the placebo group and calculated as 1\u00a1relative risk (i.e., 1\u00a1the herpes-zoster burden-of-illness score in the vaccine group divided by the herpes-zoster burden-of-illnessscore in the placebo group). The prespecified crite- ria for the success of the vaccine with respect to theburden of illness due to herpes zoster required aVE BOI point estimate of 47 percent or more and a lower bound of the 95 percent confidence intervalgreater than 25 percent. A method of assessing thecombined effect of disease incidence, severity, andduration, weighted for age group, was used. 31 Vaccine efficacy with respect to the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia (VE PHN ) was defined as the relative reduction in the incidence of postherpeticneuralgia in the vaccine group as compared withthat in the placebo group. The prespecified criteriafor the success of the vaccine with respect to the in-cidence of postherpetic neuralgia required a VE PHN point estimate of 62 percent or more and a lowerbound of the 95 percent confidence interval greaterthan 25 percent. The VE PHN was calculated with the use of a conditional exact method weighted forage group. 34-36 The VE PHN was also calculated with the use of alternative definitions of postherpeticneuralgia as pain present for more than 30, 60, 120,and 182 days after the onset of rash caused by herpeszoster. Vaccine efficacy with respect to the incidenceof herpes zoster (VE HZ ) was calculated similarly. Efficacy analyses were performed with the use of a follow-up period that excluded the first 30 days af-ter vaccination and excluded subjects who with-drew and those in whom a confirmed case of herpeszoster developed within the first 30 days after vacci-nation. The results were essentially unchangedwhen subjects in whom herpes zoster developedduring the first 30 days were included. All reportedP values are two-sided. conduct of the study The study was designed by the planning and execu-tive committees of the Shingles Prevention StudyGroup, the members of which were selected for rel-evant expertise, with the support of a planning grantfrom the VACSP to the study chairs (details areprovided in the Supplementary Appendix). Merckcontributed to the planning process through twononvoting members on these committees. The sta-tistical methods for analyzing burden of illness weredeveloped and published by Merck statisticians be-fore the initiation of the study. 31 The study was ini- tiated and implemented as a VA Cooperative Studyin collaboration with the National Institute of Al-lergy and Infectious Diseases and Merck. Merck, theholder of the investigational new drug application,participated in the organization of oversight activi-ties and monitored the progress of the study. TheCovalent Group, an independent company, washired by Merck to monitor case report forms andadherence to the study protocol and to report to Merck and the VACSP. The participating investiga-tors and their staff gathered the data. An unblindedstatistician at the VACSP coordinating center, whowas not involved in the operation of the study, pre- n engl j med 352;22 www.nejm.org june 2, 2005 efficacy of a varicella-zoster virus vaccine 2275 sented unblinded safety data to the data and safety monitoring board. Management and consolidation of the data were performed by the VACSP coordinating center.Data-analysis programs were developed and testedby biostatisticians and programmers at the coordi-nating center and at Merck. The data were analyzedat the coordinating center. The executive committeereviewed and approved the data-analysis plan andall analyses of vaccine efficacy and safety andvouches for the study's results. The writing com-mittee, all members of which were also members ofthe executive committee, wrote the manuscript andtakes responsibility for it. characteristics of the study subjects A total of 38,546 subjects were enrolled in thestudy between November 1998 and September 2001(Fig. 1). The numbers enrolled at each study site ranged from 1167 to 2508. Follow-up was complet-ed in April 2004. The demographic characteristicsof the two study groups were similar (Table 1). Themedian age in both groups was 69 years; 6.6 per-cent of the vaccine recipients and 6.9 percent of theplacebo recipients were 80 years of age or older. Atenrollment, most of the subjects had no health-related limitations on their activities (51.3 percent) or mild health-related limitations (38.6 percent).More than 95 percent of the subjects were actively followed to the end of the study (Fig. 1) and com-pleted a closeout interview. The mean duration ofherpes zoster surveillance was 3.13 years (median,3.12 years; range, 1 day to 4.90 years) with no dif-ference in duration between the groups. Only 0.6percent of the subjects withdrew from the study or were lost to follow-up; 4.1 percent died during thestudy. confirmed cases for the efficacy analyses More than 3500 rashes that developed in subjectsin each treatment group were evaluated clinically butwere not considered to be suspected cases of her-pes zoster. A total of 1308 subjects with suspectedherpes zoster were evaluated according to the pro-tocol (Fig. 1). Among these subjects, 317 (156 in thevaccine group and 161 in the placebo group) weredetermined not to have herpes zoster. Of these 317subjects, 49 had rashes that were caused by HSV(24 in the vaccine group and 25 in the placebogroup). Closeout interviews did not identify any pre-viously unreported cases of herpes zoster. Of the1308 suspected cases of herpes di- agnosis in 1156 cases (88.4 percent; 417 in the vac-cine group and 739 in the placebo group) was basedon the results of the PCR assay. Of the 1308 suspected cases, 984 (75.2 percent) were determined to be confirmed cases. In accor-dance with the protocol, 24 cases were excludedfrom the efficacy analyses because they occurredwithin 30 days of vaccination (6 in the vaccine groupand 18 in the placebo group) and 3 because theywere a subject's second episode of herpes zoster(Fig. 1). The remaining 957 confirmed cases of her-pes zoster (315 in the vaccine group and 642 in theplacebo group) constituted the end points of the ef-ficacy analyses. The results of PCR testing were pos-itive for wild-type VZV DNA in more than 93 percentof the confirmed cases of herpes zoster in eachstudy group (Fig. 1). Vaccine virus DNA was not de-tected in any subjects with suspected herpes zoster. The rate of use of antiviral medication among subjects with confirmed cases of herpes zoster wassimilar in the two groups (87.3 percent in the vac-cine group and 85.7 percent in the placebo group),as was the proportion in whom treatment was ini-tiated within 72 hours of the onset of rash \u2014 in64.1 percent in the vaccine group and 65.9 percentin the placebo group. The frequency of use of vari-ous medications to treat pain resulting from her-pes zoster was similar in the two groups, and theaverage duration of the use of opioids and the aver-age quantity of opioids used among subjects withherpes zoster were greater in the placebo groupthan in the vaccine group. Thus, differences in the use of pain medication did not inflate the estimatesof VE BOI or VE PHN . burden of illness to herpes zoster The herpes-zoster burden-of-illness score was sig-nificantly reduced in the vaccine group as comparedwith the placebo group (P<0.001) (Table 2). Over-all, VE BOI was 61.1 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 51.1 to 69.1), a result that met the prespec-ified criteria for success. There were no significantdifferences in the VE BOI when the results were stratified according to sex or age (Table 2). incidence of postherpetic neuralgia There were 107 cases of postherpetic neuralgia, 27in the vaccine group and 80 in the placebo group(0.46 case vs. 1.38 cases per 1000 person-years, re-spectively; P<0.001) (Table 3). Overall, the VE PHNresults n engl j med 352;22 www.nejm.org june 2 , 2005 The new england journal of medicine 2276 Figure 1. Diagram of the Study Design and Results. The intention-to-treat population included all subjects who underwent randomization. Efficacy analyses were performed with the use of a follow-up interval that excluded the first 30 days after vaccination and the modified intention-to-treat populatio n, which excluded subjects who withdrew or in whom a confirmed case of herpes zoster developed within the first 30 days after vaccination. For three subjects in whom more than one confirmed case of herpes zoster developed, only the first case was in-cluded in the modified intention-to-treat in intention-to-treat population from modified intention-to-treat population Cases of herpes zoster within 30 days of vaccination (n=6) Second episode of herpes zoster (n=1)Excluded from modified intention-to-treat population Cases of herpes zoster within 30 days of vaccination (n=18) Second episode of herpes zoster (n=2)Not case of herpes HSV-positive]) Not of herpes zoster in modified Positive PCR testing (n=294 [93.3%]) Positive for VZV on culture by local virology laboratory (n=2 [0.6%]) Diagnosis of herpes zoster by clinical evaluation committee (n=19 [6.0%])Confirmed cases of herpes zoster in modified PCR testing (n=600 [93.5%]) Positive for VZV on culture by local virology laboratory (n=8 [1.2%]) Diagnosis of herpes zoster by engl j med 352;22 www.nejm.org june 2, 2005 efficacy of a varicella-zoster virus vaccine 2277 was 66.5 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 47.5 to 79.2), a result that met the prespecified cri-teria for success. There were no significant differ-ences in the VE PHN when the results were stratified according to sex or age (Table 3). The VE PHN did not change appreciably when postherpetic neuralgia was defined with the use ofalternative cutoff times for the duration (persis-tence) of pain (Table 3). In a time-to-event analysis, the cumulative incidence of postherpetic neuralgiawas significantly lower in the vaccine group than inthe placebo group (P<0.001) (Fig. 2A). incidence of herpes zoster The overall incidence of herpes zoster per 1000 per-son-years was significantly reduced by the zostervaccine, from 11.12 per 1000 person-years in theplacebo group to 5.42 per 1000 person-years in thevaccine group (P<0.001) (Table 2). The VE HZ was 51.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 44.2to 57.6). In a time-to-event analysis, the cumulativeincidence of herpes zoster was significantly lowerin the vaccine group than in the placebo group(P<0.001) (Fig. 2B). The VE HZ was 37.6 percent among subjects 70 years of age or older and 63.9 percent among younger subjects (P<0.001). There was no difference in VE HZ according to sex. duration and severity of herpes zoster The median duration of pain and discomfort amongsubjects with confirmed cases of herpes zoster wassignificantly shorter in the vaccine group than in theplacebo group (21 days vs. 24 days, P=0.03). Simi-larly, the mean herpes-zoster severity-of-illnessscore (A UC) among subjects with confirmed cases of herpes zoster was significantly lower in the vac-cine group than in the placebo group (141.2 vs.180.5, P=0.008). For almost every level of the severi-ty-of-illness score, there were fewer cases of herpes zoster in the vaccine group than in the placebogroup. The effect of the zoster vaccine on the se- verity of illness was greater among older subjects;thus, the VE BOI , the primary end point of the study, was maintained at 55.4 percent. vaccine safety in the total study population Over the entire study period, the numbers and per- centages of deaths were similar in both studygroups (Table 4). During the first 42 days after vac- cination, the number and types of serious adverse events were sim ilar in the two groups (Table 4), as * Not all subjects responded to every question in the questionnaires.

Duringthis period, varicella-like rashes at the injection siteoccurred more frequently among those in the vac-cine group than among those in the placebo group,but varicella-like rashes at other sites occurred atsimilar rates in the two groups (Table 4). Therewere 7 confirmed cases of herpes zoster in the vac-cine group and 24 in the placebo group during thefirst 42 days after vaccination. Five subjects had serious adverse events that were assessed by site investigators as possibly vac-cine-related. Two subjects had received vaccine: a64-year-old woman who had an exacerbation ofasthma two days after receiving the vaccination, andan 80-year-old man in whom symptoms of polymy-algia rheumatica developed on day 3. The remain- ing three subjects, all men, who had serious ad-verse events had received placebo: the first subjectwas 65 years of age and had an anaphylactoid reac-tion 90 minutes after receiving the vaccination (and30 minutes after eating peanuts); the second was 69 years of age and received a diagnosis of polymy-algia rheumatica on day 15; and the third was 78years of age and received a diagnosis of Goodpas-ture's syndrome on day 52. adverse-events substudy In the adverse-events substudy, a significantly great-er number of subjects in the vaccine group had oneor more adverse events than in the placebo group,reflecting a greater frequency of adverse events atthe injection site among subjects in the vaccinegroup (Table 4). In the vaccine group, the most fre-quent adverse events at the injection site wereerythema (in 35.8 percent of the vaccine group), pain or tenderness (in 34.5 percent), swelling (in26.2 percent), and pruritus (in 7.1 percent). No oth-er adverse event at the injection site was observed inmore than 2 percent of the vaccine recipients. Over-all, the proportion of subjects with one or more sys-temic adverse events was similar in the two groups; * Efficacy analyses were performed with the use of a follow-up interval that excluded the first 30 days after vaccination and in a modified intention-to-treat population, which excluded subjects who either withdrew from the study or in whom a confirmed case of herpes zoster developed within the first 30 days after vaccination. Of three subjects in whom more than one case of herpes zoster developed, only the first case was included. VE BOI denotes vaccine efficacy for the burden of illness due to herpes zoster (BOI), and CI confidence interval. For the total population and the subgroups stratified according to sex, the BOI score in each treatment group (vaccine or placebo) was the weighted average of the observed BOI stratified according to age, with weights proportional to the total number of subjects within each age group; subjects in whom herpes zoster did not develop were assigned a score of 0 for severity of illness due to herpes zoster on the basis of the Zoster Brief Pain Inventory, a questionnaire developed for the Shingles Prevention Study. For the total population and for subgroups stratified according to sex, the incidence of herpes zoster in each treatment group was the weighted average of the observed incidence of herpes zoster stratified according to age group, with weights proportional to the total number of person-years of follow-up in each age group. \u00a7V E BOI for all subjects was the protocol-specified primary end point.

In the substudy, during the 42 days after vacci- nation, significantly more subjects in the vaccinegroup had serious adverse events than in the placebogroup (1.9 percent vs. 1.3 percent, respectively; P=0.03); there were no significant differences inthe distribution of serious adverse events accord-ing to body system or type of event (data notshown). A post hoc, subject-by-subject review ofserious adverse events conducted by the writingcommittee revealed no clinically meaningful dif- ferences between the groups in the pathophysiol-ogy, nature, timing, intensity, or outcome of theseevents.The number of subjects who had one or more hospitalizations was similar in the two groups. Nohospitalization among subjects in either group wasconsidered to be related to the vaccine. The pain and discomfort of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia cause substantial morbid-ity among 9-12,15,28 Although herpes zoster is not a reportable disease, we estimate that 1 million or more cases occur each year in the UnitedStates, a number that is likely to increase as the pop-ulation ages. Thus, a means of prevention would of-fer important medical and economic benefits. The zoster vaccine reduced the burden of illnessdiscussion * For the secondary end point, postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) was defined as the pain and discomfort associated with her- pes zoster rated as 3 or more, on a scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine), persisting or appearing more than 90 days after the onset of herpes zoster rash. Efficacy analyses were performed with the use of a fol-low-up interval that excluded the first 30 days after vaccination and the modified intention-to-treat population, which ex-cluded subjects who withdrew or in whom a confirmed case of herpes zoster developed within the first 30 days after vac-cination. Of three subjects in whom more than one confirmed case of herpes zoster developed, only the first case was included. VE PHN denotes vaccine efficacy for the incidence of PHN, and CI confidence interval. For the total population and the subgroups stratified according to sex, the incidence of PHN in each treatment group (vaccine or placebo) was the weighted average of the observed incidence of PHN stratified according to age group, with weights proportional to the total number of person-years of follow-up in each age group. V E PHN for all subjects was the protocol-specified secondary end point. \u00a7 PHN was defined as the pain and discomfort associated with herpes zoster that was rated as 3 or more persisting or ap- pearing more than 30, 60, 90, 120, and 182 days after the onset of herpes zoster rash.

Signifi-cant efficacy with respect to the incidence of post-herpetic neuralgia was demonstrated, regardless of how postherpetic neuralgia was defined, with a trend toward greater efficacy for postherpetic neu-ralgia of longer duration. The vaccine also showedsignificant efficacy for these end points even whenthe results were stratified according to age and sex.Zoster vaccine also reduced the overall incidence ofherpes zoster by 51.3 percent and significantly re-duced the pain and discomfort among subjects inwhom herpes zoster developed. Although the ef-fect of zoster vaccine on the incidence of herpeszoster was less among older subjects than amongyounger subjects, the effect of the vaccine on theseverity of illness was greater among older sub-jects, so that the VE BOI , the primary end point of the study, was maintained at 55.4 percent.We believe that the observed efficacy of the zoster vaccine reflects its ability to boost immunity to VZV in vaccinated subjects \u2014 an issue that willrequire further study. The investigational zostervaccine had low rates of serious adverse events, sys-temic adverse events, hospitalization, and death.Results were similar in the two study groups, andlocal reactions at the vaccination site were general-ly mild. The greater number of early cases of herpeszoster in the placebo group, as compared with thevaccine group, and the fact that no vaccine virusDNA was detected, indicate that the vaccine did notcause or induce herpes zoster. The minimum potency of the zoster vaccine ad- ministered to subjects in the study was at least 14times greater than the minimum potency of Varivax(Merck), the vaccine currently licensed to preventvaricella. A preliminary study indicated that poten-cies of this magnitude are required to elicit a signif-icant increase in the cell-mediated immunity to Figure 2.

Cumulative incidence, ex-pressed as a percentage of the subjects at risk, is the probability of the development of the disease during the period from 30 days after vac-cination to the follow-up time.1.0Cumulative Incidence of PHN (%)0.80.9 0.7 0.6 0.4 0.3 0.10.5 0.2 0.0 0 1 2 3 4 5Zoster vaccinePlacebo Years of Follow-up 3.5 3.0 2.0 1.5 0.52.5 1.0 0.0 0 1 2 3 4 5Zoster vaccinePlacebo Years of Follow-up 2, 2005 efficacy of a varicella-zoster virus vaccine 2281 * The rates of death and of hospitalization are percentages of subjects in each treatment group. Otherwise, percentages are rates weighted in proportion to the number of subjects with safety follow-up in each age group. NC denotes not cal- culated. Three subjects who had withdrawn from the study because of worsening health and subsequently died were in-cluded in the safety analysis. The difference in risk (vaccine group\u00a1placebo group) and the 95 percent confidence intervals for deaths and hospitaliza- tions are based on the rates per 1000 subject-years of follow-up to account for differential follow-up among the study par-ticipants as a result of staggered enrollment. Otherwise, the differences in risk and 95 percent confidence intervals are based on an asymptotic method for the difference of two binomial proportions where the proportions are weighted ac-cording to the number of subjects with safety follow-up in each age group. Negative values for the difference in risk result when the rate in the placebo group is larger than that in the vaccine group. Events classified as possibly related to vaccination were assessed by a blinded investigator at each site.\u00a7 P<0.05 for the comparison with the placebo group.\u00b6A temperature of 38.3\u00b0C or higher was not documented. \u00bf None of the adverse events related to the injection site were considered to be serious adverse events.

Weknow of no data to suggest that the licensed vari-cella vaccine would be efficacious in protectingolder adults from herpes zoster or postherpeticneuralgia. Thus, we do not recommend the use ofthe current varicella vaccine in an attempt to pro-tect against herpes zoster and postherpetic neural-gia. The results of our study show that vaccinationof immunocompetent persons 60 years of age andolder with live attenuated zoster vaccine (Oka/ Merck) markedly decreases the morbidity associat-ed with herpes zoster and the incidence of posther-petic neuralgia.

The members of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors plan to consider clinical trials for publication only if they have been registered (see N Engl J Med 2004;351:1250-1). The National Library of Medicine's www.clinicaltrials.gov is a free registry, open to all investigators, that meets the committee's requirements. "}
