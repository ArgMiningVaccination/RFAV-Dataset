There has never been a cure for any virus ( The common cold is a virus as is the flu. This is about socialism and communism. This is to take away the ri ghts to work and achieve. This is a form of slavery. I will be in slaved to provide housing to people too lazy to work! This is a form of raci sm against people who work and try to achieve success. The government makes me pay my taxes or takes my property! I have to pay my insurance no matter what! I have to pay my mortgage no matter what! I have to fix the roof no matter what! I have to fix the furnace no matter what! I have to fix the window or door even though I didn't break it! I have to fix the dry wall even though I didn't break it! I have to pay the water even though I didn't leave the faucet run! I have to fix the water heater no matter what! I have to mow the lawn because they were too lazy! I have to remove snow because they were too lazy! With this I will have to give them a place to live because they are too lazy to work or just didn't like what they were doing or they just haven't found themselves or their MOMMY quit babysitting them! I would have to pay for those breaking the law. I don't do this for my health! Do any of you have rental property? Put yourself in my shoes. I cannot pay my bills if I do not receive rent.

[CAUTION] This email comes from a sender outside your organization. Good evening : I am associated with several small non-profits taking on hunger and housing issues in our community. Tonight my focus is shelter for our many homeless on the streets. We have a weather crisis facing our community and this crisis n eeds our immediate attention. The Mission is doing a great job of m eeting most needs. But they are stre tched thin and at the max. We need temporary shelter mid-town to help people who can't get to the Mission. Before we have a death, I am asking the city to immediately assess the situ ation and current needs. I know of a local non-profit that will provide manpower, food, coffee etc....if someone could just provide a location downtown; even just one small room.

I am writing in regard to the declaration of emer gency that you put in pl ace March 16, 2020. I am wondering if you are going to end th is emergency and if not, when are you going to allow the public to have some input and be able to speak about this issue at the council meetings? I would also like to address the issue of allowing us to sit in the council chambers. Othe r city councils in the state of Nebraska, such as Omaha and Papilli on have allowed their citizens to sit in the chambers and get up and speak. It seems to me that you as a council, ar e silencing the voices of th e citizens of Lincoln. Also, by not allowing us to sit in the chamber, you are limiting our representation during the council process. May I remind you that you work for us and that we elected you to represent us, not the other way around. Mary Hamilton Taxpayer and citizen of Lincoln, Nebraska Sent from ProtonMail Mobile 5Angela M. Birkett To: Council Packet Subject: Mask Mandate [CAUTION] This email comes from a sender outside your organization. It is way past time to end the mask mandate and let citi zens and businesses make thei r own decisions. Businesses should be able to make decisions on how they want to cond uct business; and citizens should be able to make their own decisions as well. Thank you -- Sheri A. Robertson 6Angela M. Birkett Council Packet Subject: Monday Night's City Council Meeting [CAUTION] This email comes from a sender outside your organization. Hello city council representatives, 1) I am writing to let you know that I am disappointed in the overall response by the counc il regarding what Sam Lyon discussed with you...the emer gency declaration and power given (by you) to the mayor. Wh en he brought up the issue to you Ms. Raybould was quick to interrupt him (were you concerned because he was speaking truth?) with filibuster-type talk, then you bring in the mayor's city attorney (who didn't know the rules for how this situation is handled without some quick research himself). I am asking as a long time citizen of Lincoln and someone concerned about our leadership that you address this situation ASAP, give the citizens of Lincoln the opportunity to have a public forum to discuss/share their concerns and extreme frustration with you ASAP, and then do what is right and take your duties and authority BACK very, very quickly. 2) The image (as I watched the FULL city council meeting via T V due to other obligations this past Monday) of no citizens allowed in the room with you for the first portion of the night was of highly questionable motives and effort on behalf of all o f you. If you did not agree with th e decision to keep the citizens out of the room from the beginning then take a stand... 7Why does it take a citizen (again...no previous political ties or citizen leadership prior to poor choices by the council in the past year) to interrupt your agenda and bring this to your attention??? Why? Why is it that a citizen shows more concern and leadership Monday night than most of you (thank you Mr. Christensen for supporting and standing up for Sam Lyon Monday night...I thought Mr. Shobe would also, as he has been vocal in the past for citize n's rights to be heard). I though t you were leaders and had the fortitude to make the right decisions even if it is against your friends/political party??? Do the RIGHT thing and do not attempt to silence or limit the public from input... Over 100 people crowded around 1 TV (yes, Ms. Raybould people want to SEE and HEAR wh at was going on inside prior to testifying...give me a break, and think of the people you represent wanting to be heard). How can you allow Ms. Lopez to simply walk away from a situation in which her leadership/answer is VITAL and for what we are paying not out of the realm of her job. How can the Mayor and Ms. Lopez be allowed to say/impose mandates on the residents and then not address an egregious violation within their own building (that was caused by YOU...not the citizens). Call our Mayor and have her show up to address the problem...The citizens could not socially distance...you enabled and encouraged it. You expect citizens to be lined up to the entrance doors waitin g because you stay comfortable in the chambers by yourselves? 3) Thank you Lincoln Journal Star for running the article this morning about the recall...I am not surprised, but VERY disappointed in all of you who were up for recall (including Mr. Meginnis who is a Republican who should support what the recall stood for). $1,500 each fr om the city council members up for recall and during the recall you didn't DARE disclose that 8you were financing the counter practice??? So you support the people who were screaming th ings to our female recall volunteers things like \"I hope you get raped\", and such? By bank rolling the effort you did just that. If you disagreed with what the LNK Recall effort was doing then be transparent and let your constituents know that you have been funding the counter effort...like I said above TAKE A STAND AND DO WHAT IS RIGHT! You didn't do what was right, you funded a counter effort and acted as if you had no association with Decline to Sign. Of course our Mayor used reelection $$$ to protect herself by financing the Decline to Sign movement...Ms. Washington / Mr. Shobe / Mr. Christensen...please make a public statement of disassociation with what your fellow council members have done. Ms. Raybould / Mr. Bowers / Mr. Meginnis / Ms. Ward - Your decisions in the past year (and especially the past few months) have hindered the trust from the people you supposedly represent. Ms. Washington / Mr. Shobe / Mr. Christensen - We will kno w in April or May whether you have done enough to continue to represent the citizens of Lincoln. I KNOW you haven't done everything you should have. If I were on our city council I would have taken a stand, done everything I could to allow the citizens of Lincoln to keep as many freedoms as possible thru the past year, and if it didn't make me popular...vote me out. To do nothing and allow Lincoln to go into a decline is simply not acceptable and shouldn't have ever been! ** Mr. Shobe is good at responding to emails and phone calls by the people he represents (thank you)...how about the rest of you? ** To: Packet Cc: Mayor Subject: Dangerous situation in hallway [CAUTION] This email comes from a sender outside your organization. 13Council, When I spoke before you on Februa ry 8th, there seemed to be some confusion regarding the full extent of the consequences of your rule change banishing the public to the hallway. I told you I would send pictures. Please find them attached for your consideration. Councilperson Raybould seemed confused as to why people might be interested in the meeting going on in the council chambers. The pub lic had come to take part in the meeting and they were restricted from it. I spoke with two women who left because th ey were not being accommodated. They had come to watch the meeting, but they were not planning on offering testimony. There was no place for them to safely watch the meeting. One man had trouble hearing from the monitor with the background noise of a busy hallway. Many were uncomfortable crowding around a monitor where no social distancing was possible. This is obviously a huge problem and needs to be addressed before the next meeting. The public must have access to city council meetings! Many people I have spoken with said being for ced to wait in the hallway makes them feel like you think they are less valuable than those on the Council. Some reflected on the similarities to what it is like in other countr ies where a monarchy or a dictator is in power. People have to wait outside and are brought in individually. I'm confident this is not your intention and so I wanted to bri ng it to your attention quickly. If safety and social distancing is the goal, then it would make sense to have the 18 chairs in the council chambers filled to allow for less pe ople in the hallway. Just because you push the problem into the hallway, doesn't make it magi cally disappear. In fact, it makes the problem worse. This simply ensures that you just don't have to look at it. Since the rule change in reality causes less po ssibility for social distancing, it leaves people to assume that perhaps you just don't want to see the faces of those you represent. Please let me know how you intend to solve these issues. Samuel Lyon Lincoln, NE 14Angela M. Birkett From: Brooke 2021 3:41 PM To: Council Packet Subject: I want to speak with a council member ASAP. [CAUTION] This email comes from a sender outside your organization. Hello, I'm a very concerned citizen and parent . I live in the northwest part of Lincoln, specifically in the neighborhood where West Lincoln Elementary School resides. I live less than 3/4 of a mile from that school and have a child who attends school there. I was recently made aware that there are two child sex offenders, living together, two houses away from me. I am aware that it is nearly impossible to find a place to live where NO children are present, and that these offenders still need a home to live in. However to live less than a mile from an elementary school seems a bit suspicious. I was even less pleased when I found out however that th e city of Lincoln only requires these offenders to not live within 500 feet of a school. Are yo u serious? Someone in the city of Lincoln can sexually assault a child and live less than a football field away from a school. Its a sh ame. It's disgusting. It needs to be changed. Every single house surrounding the offenders home has small ch ildren living in it. When I called the police station, the county sheriff, etc, I was told there is nothing that can be done. While I am a firm believer in rehabilitation of criminals ( I truly believe most can turn their liv es around), the state of Nebraska has labeled these offenders as lifetime offenders. Doesn't that say someth ing? The state thinks they are dangerous enough that they are required to register for the rest of their lives. The city of Lincoln on the other hand, they are going to allow these offenders to live right next door to their ta rget victims. There must be something done about this. I expect a response from a council member. I would prefer that they email me back to set up a time to speak with them on the phone. However if you would prefer to reach me by phone the number is 402-217-2818. Thank you, To: Council Packet Subject: Sam lion [CAUTION] This email comes from a sender outside your organization. Sam Lion brings up a very good point that an agenda item cannot be discussed because it's \"pending\" on the agenda and pending with no future date. The point was raised to remove this off th e agenda so a person can actually speak as a citizen of Lincoln, but effectively cannot due to a procedural practice to indefinitely keep the topic from being discussed. Is this really where we are? Cancel any dissenting opinion or voice of people who wish to be heard on a subject that is greater than 300 days old? Is this rea lly the stance and intent of a city council to not a llow a topic to be heard. Clearly this is a process to do that and strongly advocate to vote to remo ve for public comment. I actually can't believe this isn't seen by the council and find myself wondering why it's nece ssary for me to even need to take the time to write this email. What country is this? Sent from my iPhone 16Angela M. Birkett PM To: Council Packet Subject: Let citizens back in your chambers [CAUTION] This email comes from a sender outside your organization. Dear City Council, For weeks and months you have restricted Lincoln's citizens from entering your presence more than one at a time. This is not acceptable. We are now in yellow and there can be no reason related to safety that would require this action. Especially considering that a s it currently stands, citizens are allo wed to enter a few at a time and while waiting for the next speaker, rotate through the same few chairs. These chairs are not sanitized between speakers. Out in the crowded halls, those coming to speak to you are forced to h uddle around one single TV in an attempt to watch what is happening in your meeting. This additionally puts those desiring to speak t o you in additional risk of health. It may surprise you to know that after so many years of inattention from Lincoln's citizens, a growing number are being negativ ely affected by the Mayor. They have looked to you as City Council to intervene for them - as that IS your role. Your position was designed to be a check on our city's execu tive branch and to listen to what the people want/need. However, more and more of us are noticing that you are becoming a check on the people of Lincoln instead. For many years, your uninteresting meetings have not s een the desire of Lincoln's citizens to observe your dealings - That has now changed and it is your responsibility to safely accomm odate them. Shoving them all together in front of 1 TV in the hallwa y while an entire room of seats stand empty is not a reasonable accommodation. Furthermore, it also discrimi nates against those with vi sual and hearing disabilities who are unable to see and hear one small TV in the bustle of an extremely crowded hallway. Which leads us all to ask the question... Was this really for ou r safety in the first place? Or is it that you didn't want to e ven see the faces of you have silenced? One might even think the lack of seating, accommodating th e viewing and sound from the meeting, etc . might be an attempt on your part to make your constituents as uncomfortable and unaccommodated as possible to discourage them from coming to speak to you at all. I would appreciate hearing ba ck from each of you with: - How you intend to remedy this situation - If you support opening the chambers again - If the answer above is \"no,\" what are your reasons as we ll as the facts and statistics su pporting your current position Thank you in advance for your reply, Nicole Lyon Lincoln, NE 17Angela M. Birkett Council Packet Subject: eviction moratorium [CAUTION] This email comes from a sender outside your organization. Please don't allow renters to go rent free.

Birkett From: David B PM To: Mayor; Council Packet Subject: Considerations when evaluating and approv ing actions related to the Lincoln Climate Resiliency Action Plan [CAUTION] This email comes from a sender outside your organization. Mayor and City C ouncil Members, The Climate Resiliency Action Plan th at was developed and released last year places a high value on the transition to renewable sources of energy with a strong emphasis on wind and solar. I am all for renewable energy done right. Below is an email I sent to the Lancaster County Board today specifically addressing the proposed change to offsets (the distance a wind turbine can be from residences) that is currently being considered and the potential health affects that need to be analyzed and assessed. The end of my email focuses on the configuration of future renewable systems to better align with the needs of LES and how we as customer s of use electricity 24x7, not on an intermittent basis as it is generated. This is a very important concept to understand as making renewables function as a baseload generating source like nuc lear, coal or natural gas will re quire the implementation of energy storage systems increasing the CAPEX on these invest ments by up to 50% and extending the ROI over currently stated project costs and projections. Like any good risk management plan, diversity is important. I believe th e same goes for power generation. Wind and solar are great, however they are not the single \"silver bullet\". On cold days like today when the wind is not blowin g and the solar panels are covered with ice and snow, the ability to generate the needed electricity for our city from cheap and abundan t natural gas seems very wise. Advanced natural gas plants with the proper emissions technologie s can have very low lifecycle carbon footprints. Even coal plants with the proper NOx, SOx, and carbon sequestr ation technologies can keep our air fresh and our skies blue. Power generation technologies improv e over time along wi th their efficiencies. Just because a power generation source is not based on wind or solar does not mean it should automatically be discounted as part of Lincoln's future. My suggestion to you is to take a measured approach to transiti oning our power generation mix by placing the same priority on availability, reliability, and cost to the consumer as is being placed on carbon footprint reductions. 19 Thank you in advance for your time and consideration. David R. Blythe Managing Director Monte Cristo Engineering & Development +1-303-330-8547 david @montecristoengdev.com www.montecristoengdev.com Lancaster County Board Members, My name is David Blythe and have worked for powe r utilities and in the fiel d of renewable energy for the past 35 years. We work on wind, solar and hybrid power projects globally. We ar e very familiar with the current issues and regulations in the EU, specifically Ge rmany where they have 5.2 GW of installed onshore wind power. New projects in Germany are increasing setbacks, not reducing them. The current minimum setback is 1 km (.62 miles) and they are pushing to increase that to 1.2km minimum. The reason for this is issues with low frequency sound called \"infrasound\" . Infrasound is not well understood and is just one of the potential health effects when in constant close proximity to large- scale wind turbines. Many health effects studies focused on Infras ound are underway world-wide. The other potential health effects from close proximity to wind turb ines include audible noise, EMF, and shadow flicker. Low audi ble noise of >40 dB(A) contri butes to sleep disturbances. Any planned reductions in wind tu rbine setbacks by Lancaster County are short-sided, the merits will debated, and will likely result in lit igation as has happ ened elsewhere. With the land available in Nebraska and Lancaste r County, reducing the setbacks should not be considered as a viable option until further st udies are completed and liabilities assessed. Furthermore, approving ANY wind project in Lancaster C ountry should include a requirement of a co- located energy storage unit (ie. battery) to en sure the power produced can be supplied on a 20continuous, reliable basis. Intermi ttent power is power, however not the solution we need in Lancaster County. Thank you for your time an d attention to my email. 21Angela M. Birkett From: Robert Borer LB637 is infected with medical tyranny, Sena tor Hunt weighs in with expert religion Follow Up Flag: Follow up Flag Status: Completed [CAUTION] This email comes from a sender outside your organization. Senator Hunt- Thank you for your response and the opportunity to further address LB637 and medical tyranny. #1) You missed, and failed to address, the entire point of my letter\u2014the un constitutionality of medical tyranny. #2) Your faith in medical experts wi th regard to \"infectious diseases\" and alleged pandemics is naive and misplaced. I have queried your/our stat e and local so-called \"p ublic health experts\" (Anthone and Lopez, if interested) and neither they nor thei r hotshot lawyers could point me to any science proving SARS-CoV-2 to be a novel deadly contagion. There were al ready plenty of ways for people to ge t sick (not the least of which is allopathic medicine itself). All th ey needed was a narrative so they could fear-monger the population into accepting radical changes to society. Medi cal science is not a hard science. It's more akin to a cult, a false religion...and I can provide plenty of evidence to support that notion. #3) What entitles you to make the judg ment that medical experts are expe rts, anyway? Do you know everything they know and don't know? If not, then your judgment is entirely faith-based. The most you can say is that they have a certain degree\u2014in a narrow field of pharmaceutical company indoctrination. That degree does not confer critical thinking skills and immunity to logical fallacies . Nor does it confer integrity and immunity to character flaws and corruption. #4) Medical expertism is the new religion. People embr ace it because it exempts them from having to take personal responsibility for their healt h. Politicians embrace it because they th ink it exempts them from having to do the hard work of thinking and making rational argumen ts. There's no place for it in the Constitution, except as the private religion of your choice. You can't force it on the rest of us. We e xpect reason, logic and common sense. The fact that not all \"medical expe rts\" agree should be enough to dest roy anyone's faith in the religion of medical expertism. The fact that big pharma requires immunity from liabili ty for vaccine damage should tell you all you need to know about the integrity of modern medicine and its so-called experts. The fact that pandemic rules aren't consistent from one c ity and state to the next te stifies to the arbitrary and political nature of \"public health expert\" edicts. Medical experts can provide counsel, but that is it. They can't make laws, except as an elected member of a legislative body. 22 #5) I doubt you intended it (I'm sure you were tr ying to soft-sell the DHMs with euphemistic language/newspeak), but thank you for admitting that DH Ms are nothing more than \"guidelines.\" My friends and I will take that to the bank. That's exactly how we 've been treating them and w ill continue to treat them. Good Day- Robert J. Borer On Wed, Feb 17, 2021 at 12:52 PM Megan Hunt < mhunt@leg.ne.gov > wrote: Good Afternoon Robert, Thank you for your email regarding LB 637. I truly appr eciate hearing your perspective on this bill. The Local Public Health Departments in our state are th e experts on public health in their regional areas. They have been on the frontlines in fighting the pandemic a nd any future pandemics. The current statutes do not allow the local public health departments to issue nece ssary Directed Health Measures (DHM) within their regions without sign off from the State of Nebraska. Th is has led to a statewide DHM that does not always align with public health guideline s. LB637 would remove the requirement for the state to sign off on local DHMs. Throughout the current pandemic, there have been questi ons of authority in rela tion to local governments. LB637 also clarifies that local public health departments will have author ity over the spread of contagious diseases and other public health-related issues. Local Public Health Departments ar e required to have at least one physician on the board, one dentist on the board and one county board member from any county that is within the health district. They also include members of the public who ar e interested in public heal th and often include electe d municipal representatives and other local stakeholders. The board composition is intended to weigh public health expertise combined with community needs. The local boards of health ar e subject to the Open Meetings Act and thus require transparency and public input on decisions being made. I will wait to commit my support for LB 637 until it adva nces from committee. Bills are often amended and changed after the committee hearing and between rounds of floor debate, and I expect LB 637 to be no exception. I understand that some individua ls have concerns about the bill, and I expect them to make their views known to the legislature. Thank you again for your time and engagement on this issue. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns. Best, Meg On Wed, Feb 17, 2021 at 11:37 AM Robert Borer < robert.borer@doane.edu > wrote: Family and Friends- Nebraska State Senator Tony Vargas, a democrat and NYC transplant, seeks to expand the powers of local Nebraska \"health\" depa rtments with LB637. Vargas l \"health\" officials \"exclusive contro l and authority over the investigation 23of the existence of any contagious or infectious disease\" and authorize them to \"adopt such measures, which shall have the force and affect of law, as [they de em] necessary to limit the spread and ameliorate the presence of such disease within the territori al boundaries of the health department.\" Here's the problem. If the performance of our local \"health\" officials this past year tells us anything at all, it's that they can't be trusted with th e power they already have. If they didn't take it upon themselves to abuse their power this past year, they played the puppet a nd allowed their power to be abused by unscrupulous politicians. They showed no regard whatso ever for the supreme law of the land. Of course, the corrupt politicians didn't either. But th ey did swear an oath, and this makes them culpable. Mr. Vargas appears to fall into this category. No regard for the Constitution, though he swore an oath. If he did regard it, he wouldn't have proposed LB637. If he did regard it, he would know there is no infectious disease exception in the Constitution to our God-given, inherent and inalienable rights to life, liberty and providing for ourselves and our families. If he did re gard it, he would know we are \"by nature free and independent.\" Listen. We simply don't need his nanny state medical ty ranny. Not in this state. Big pharma germaphobia isn't the only way to deal with so-called infecti ous disease. There are much better ways. With 27 years behind me as an EMT, I have been in close proximity to many patients with the conditions referenced in state statute as infect ious. Not one of these patients ever \"infected\" me. I never worried any of them would infect me. HIV never concerned me. I was never afraid of germs and I never wore a mask. I took the same approach, from day one, with regard to the current s camdemic...and I haven't had a sniffle since it started, despite being over 62 (in big pharma's alleged \"high ri sk\" category), traveling widely and socializing extensively. You can deal with health problems in smart ways or in stupid ways, or you can prevent them. I prefer to prevent them, by building health. Germs aren't the pr oblem\u2014association isn't causa tion. They are certainly no threat to a healthy body and life. Covi d mortality stats testify very loudly to that fact. The stats are the signature of chronic degenerativ e disease, not a contagion. People compromise their health in a thousand differ ent ways through poverty of character, squalor of behavior and ignorance\u2014i.e ., poor lifestyle choices. Th e best thing a doctor can do is teach.

Good day, I have lived in Nebraska a lot of year s, sixties till today. I've lived in the country, small towns and Lincoln. In all that time I have never seen the power purposely shut off unless there was a problem with the local system. That is until this week. In all those years we had hydr o, coal and nuclear power pl ants. Now we looked like a third world country. It's not doing without power for an hour or unwillingne ss to help our fellow citiz ens. I know a little about sacrifice for others. But why, why have we gone backwards? We have always had cycles of cold weather, ice, deep snow. Yes we have had good winters and bad but this is not new. Our friends in Texas know this too. They had the experience, the warnings yet th ey were caught with their pants down, Why, two things greed and the rele ntless crying about climate change. Now I don't believe in pollution yet people still buy water in plas tic bottles while worrying about a cow passi ng gas. Why is this? Because it doesn't affect them if a rancher can't make a living but it does if they can't have their plastic bottle of water. So instead of you live your life and I'll live mine th ey have to ruin life for everyone. I see the same thing happened in the power industry. They 'll be forced to hear the scream about climate and science but never wonder about the f act the fella telling you this makes his living off of telling you this. Whether it's pay roll from government or a university, grants or some reward in some fashion, this goes on. My point is we cannot go down this gopher hole. In extr eme cold, frozen windmills, solar panels covered in snow and ice and battery powered anything are not going to work. They will not work tomorrow and they will not work decades from now. One local power company in Nebraska during this cold had windmills producing 3%, yes 3 percent. That's not even enough to much more than power the warning light s on top of them. But this company was smart, they knew this. So what did they do? They thought ahead and they have multiple sources of power; hydro, coal, nuclear, wind, solar. They didn't bet the farm on wind or solar putting the lives of people counting on 25% of their power from wind or solar. Th ey have a broad spectrum of options , reliable options AND they maintain their grid. Texas has not and we as well as them paid for it. What does Lincoln need to do. Stop list ening to people in California who can't even run their own state and have no idea what it's like to live in the cold AND listening to people that make their living telling you the sky is falling when the earth will do what it wants to do and man is no more than an ant in an elephant stampede. Don't fall into the hole. 26 Sincerely, Dale McIntosh 1Angela M. Birkett From: Jim & Roy A. Christensen; Jane Raybould; James M. Bowers; Tammy J.

Unfortunately, I am quarantining as my oldest daughter returned home from college to isolate after she tested positive for CO VID-19. However, I want to convey that LCHR supports all efforts to address and condemn harmful practices that target Lincoln community members, particularly youth, based upon protected characteristics, such as sexual orientation or gender identity, and has the infrastructure and capacity to enforce the ban on conversion therapy for minors as outlined in Ordinance 21-18. Presently, there appears to be at least 20 states that have some type of anti-conversion therapy laws. These are California, Colorado, Delaware, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Utah. In addition, there are approximately 80 counties or munici palities who have also enacted anti-conversion therapy ordinances. 5While I am a licensed attorney, my role with the City is not in such a role. So I would encourage you to seek the legal opinion of City Attorney Christie or Assistant Ci ty Attorney Abby Littrell (both cc'd). However, there are some misleading statements in Mr. Brooks' letter that I was provided that I would like to address. First, the cited case of NIFLA v. Becerra , 138 S. Ct. 2361 (2018) is not a case where the issue of anti-conversion therapy was decided--rather, the U.S. Supreme Court in NIFLA v. Becerra overruled a principle in more positive cases that did find these anti-conver sion therapy ordinances permissible (such as King v. New Jersey , 767 F.3d 216 (3d Cir. 2014) and Pickup v. Brown , 740 F.3d 1208 (9th Cir. 2014)). This principle in King v. New Jersey and Pickup v. Brown is in both cases the courts distinguished between \"professional speech\" like those from a therapist and \"ordinary speech.\" So, what this si mply means is that any ordinance that the City passes related to the anti-conversion therapy ban will be subject to \"strict scrutiny\" to see if it is permissible for the City to restrict the \"speech\" of these therapists practi cing conversion therapy under t heir freedom of speech rights guaranteed to them by the U.S. Constitution. Secondly, while it is true that the Eleventh Circuit in Otto v. City o f Boca Raton , 981 F.3d 854 (11th Cir. 2020) found an anti-conversion therapy ordinance to be unconstitutional, that decision is an outlier and being challenged on a motion for rehearing before the entire Eleventh Circuit. What I can tell you are that many municipalities hav e continued to pass bans on conversion therapy since the NIFLA v. Becerra case was decided June 26, 2018. See Anchorage, Alaska: https://www.alaskapublic.org/2020/08/27/anchorage-a ssembly-passes-ban-on-conversion-therapy/ ; City . And, not only have similar ordinances have been passed, but courts have found them to be constitutional. See Doyle v. Hogan , 411 F.Supp.3d 337 (2019) where the U.S. District Court for Maryland decided September 2019 that the conversion therapy for minors ban was constitutional. Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.

Birkett 08, 4:09 PM To: Council Subject: Amending Ordinance 21-18 -- Sexual identity/Conversion Therapy [CAUTION] This email comes from a sender outside your organization. City Council Members, Thank you for serving our community. Although I don't reside in Lincoln, I live near Raymond and am employed in Lincoln. I am writing to express concerns regarding the proposed amendments to Ordinance 21-18. First, I would object to th e wording on page 9, line 22. \"Contemporary science recognizes that being lesbian, gay, bisexual, or tran sgender is part of the natural spectrum of human identity...\" These lifestyle \"choices\" are not norma l, as God created men and women with distinct differences. If a person chooses to go against their natural, God-given design, that doesn't necessa rily make it part of the \"natural spectrum of human identity\". One's choice of how they \"identify\" sexua lly does not give them special or protected rights, other than th e ones guaranteed to all people. Second, I disagree with the conclusion found on page 10, lines 7-10 \"Sexual orientation or gender identity change efforts or conversion ther apy lead to critical health risks...\" The same could be said of those who have chosen an alternate lifestyle choice. Depression and suicide among transgenders and lesbian/gay indivi duals is alarming. To say that atte mpting to counsel or inform these individuals who are confused or questioning their sexual identity causes critical health risks is a presumption rather than a factual, data-driven conclusion. Third, and most concerning, is the \"slippery slope\" this legislation could lead to. On Page 9, lines 1-5, the word \" practice \" could be interpreted quite loosel y to refer to any teaching or instruction about sexual identity and gender issues. I am especially concerned with how this might impact our church, and it's ability to communicat e the truth as found in the Holy Sc riptures regarding these topics. Churches and pastors across our country have been the targets of censo rship, including the re quirement of some to submit sermons and teaching materials to government o fficials. This is an obvious violation of the First Amendment which safeguards not only free spe ech, but the free exercise of religion. The phrase \"... including, but not limited to ...\" is also concerning. This leaves the door wide open to a number of other \"practices\" that the Lincoln Commission on Human Rights could in th e future deem \"discriminatory\". Would my pastor be in violation of this ordinance if he taught what the Bible says about sex, marriage, homosexuality, or any other issue that might be considered \"offensive\"? Would I, as a father, be silenced by this ordinance so that I was unable to instruct my own children about these sensitive issues? In conclusion, I would say that I see no need for these am endments to this ordinance. I'm not sure how common this practice of \"conversion therapy\" is actually, but I can't imagine needing to include it in the growing list of 8\"discriminatory\" acts. I am fearful that this will be just the initial steps leading to other \"practices\" to silence those in our community that are c ounter-culture and seen as a threat to a more progressive agenda.

Collins 12801 NW 56th Street Raymond, NE 68428 (402) 613-4721 -- \"The LORD bless you and keep you; The LORD make His face shine upon you, And be gracious to you; The LORD lift up Hi s countenance upon you, And give you peace.\" Numbers 6:24-26 9Angela M.

Dear Council Members: Attached please find our letter of support for the pending ordinance protecting youth from conversion therapy. Sincerely, Shannon Minter Legal Director Council Packet Subject: Ban Conversion Therapy [CAUTION] This email comes from a sender outside your organization. Dear Lincoln City Council Members, My name is Renae Ninneman and I live in Council Pers on Bowers' district. I suppor t the ordinance to ban conversion therapy within Lincoln City limits for minor s 19 and younger. As a resident of Lincoln, I feel strongly about this not being a practice in Lincoln. I do not identify as LGBTQ, but I have spent many many years working with children and teens. I've seen teen agers in a variety of diffe rent positions talking about, learning about, and exploring their sexuality. The most happy, confident a nd powerful kids are the ones who are comfortable in their own skin and pr oud of their sexuality. Conversion ther apy is a dangerous tool used to shame children into being something they cannot and do not want to be. Conversi on therapy causes long-term damage and trauma. It must be banned. I'm a sign of the times. I was raised to believe that being gay was sinful, but havi ng done a 180 degree change, and now I believe that our LGBTQ population are an importa nt and beautiful part of our society. We need to do better to protect our kids from pe rmanent trauma. We need to make Lincoln a safe place for LGBTQ youth. It's easier to prevent trauma than it is to heal it after the damage is done. I've built my career on coaching the younger generations to grow up to make the world a better place, and this ordinance will only keep the path clear for their indomitable souls to thrive. -- ~Renae Ninneman 901 W. Tammy J. Ward; Sandra J. Washington; Council Packet Subject: Ban Conversion Therapy [CAUTION] This email comes from a sender outside your organization. I am a Lincoln resident, Mandy Berlin Coyle, I speak for myself and only myself. I am not representing any group or organization. I am a licensed mental health provider, school social worker, board member of SIFN (human rights and justice advocacy non-profit), most important I am a parent like many of us. As a parent we unconditionally love our child/ren. Ther e are no constraints, no I F's. We foster and nurture who they are. We accept and celebrate their identity, thei r love of music or love of soccer or dogs or comedy. We don't tell them their love is wr ong. We don't tell them they need to be fixed. We don't repair human beings! That is what conversion therapy is, reparative therap y. Being gay is not being broken. Gender variations are not pathological. Two weeks ago I saw this topic on the agenda, and later that day we had a school LGBT support club, I usually attend, there were about 15-20 teenager s in the room. I asked if any of th em were familiar with conversion therapy. A collective wail. It was like I had thrown hot salt water. There was a physical, visceral pain at the mere mention of the word. It hurt to see their faces. People within the LGBTQAI population seek therapy fo r the same reasons as anyone else. For depression, anxiety, for feelings of hopelessness. Not because of who they are but because of those around them. The environment is problematic, not the individual. From th e moment a child is conceived, and sometimes before we set out a mold for their identity, hopes, dreams, a nd expectations but when that mold is broken we can feel loss and grief. That's on us. It's absolutely true that discord can lead to feelings of rejection and self-worth. We know suicide risk is 8 times higher among the LGBT population. I s ee that in my own daily work right here in Lincoln when I look at my suicide risk reports. They're at 6x higher risk of de pression. Homelessness is disp roportionately high. Some estimates are 120% more likely. Every w eek I work with kids who have been kicked out of their house. Every week. In Lincoln. These are KIDS. Why would we do anyt hing that puts harm on this vulnerable population? We shouldn't. More than 20 states have banned conversi on or reparative therapy and at least 70 additional cities and counties. Medical and mental health organiza tions overwhelmingly agree, there is NO NO evidence it works, the evidence actually points to it being harmful. I am a member of School Social Workers of Ne braska and NASW. NASW's official statement is \"People seek mental health services for many reasons. Accordingly, it is fair to assert that lesbians and gay men seek therapy for the same reasons that heterosexual people do. However, the increase in media campaigns, often coupled with coercive messages from family and community members, has created an environment in which lesbians and gay men often are pressured to seek reparative or conversion therapies, which cannot and will not change sexual orientation. Aligned with the American Psychological Association's (1997) position, NCLGB [NASW's National Committee on Lesbian and Gay Issues] believes that such treatment potentially can lead to severe emotional damage. Specifically, 12transformational ministries are fueled by stigmatization of lesbians and gay men, which in turn produces the social climate that pressures some people to seek change in sexual orientation. No data demonstrate that reparative or conversion therapies are effective, and in fact they may be harmful.\" Most health organizations have similar stances. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry American Academy of Pediatrics American Association for Marriage and Family therapy American College of Physicians American Counseling Association American Medical Association American Psychiatric Association and World Psychiatric Association American School Counse ling Association (ASCA) American School Health Association Ect. Etc. etc. We don't need to hurt our kids. Please, for their sake, let's ban conversion therapy. Respectfully, Mandy Berlin To: Council Packet Subject: U6 initiative to ban Conversion Therapy in Lincoln Nebraska [CAUTION] This email comes from a sender outside your organization. I stand for this Initiative to Ban Conversion Therapy in Lincoln Nebraska. I have lived in Lincoln for over 40 years and have witnessed the great harm that conversion therapy does to members of the LGBTQ persons. I have friends and have spoken with young persons who have had the horrors of going thru the conversion therapy treatment and their lives are for ever a struggle afterwards. The treatment does not work and it leave these individuals with low self esteem, inability to function well in society, they struggle with drug and alcohol addition and never feel the are Enough. Individuals treated with conversion therapy often do self harm to themselves and others with the end result often leading to suicide. Lincoln should ban the use of conversion therapy and as it is already banned in many communities already because it's very harmful dangerous practices. I would move that the State of Nebraska should also ban conversion therapy and it should be banned from the USA entirely.

Council Members- It would appear Mr. Bowers took an oa th to tear down the Constitution rather than support it, and to replace it with rights only for a few...ri ghts for people only like him. These rights would include sexual ac tivity/promiscuity as a minor, any se xual activity, without interference from parents, teachers, pastors, counselors, politicians, etc. And minors would also have the right to expect society at large to bear the cost for any negative consequences from this activity. Mr. Bowers would deny that children n eed to be trained, disciplined, nurtur ed and educated, morally, mentally and physically. Mr. Bowers would deny that childre n are very impressionable, in bot h good and bad ways, and that many voices, both spiritual and carnal, vie for their attention, and tr y to get the upper hand, before good character is established. Mr. Bowers would elevate sexuality to the pinnacle of human identity and experience, rather than reason and mind/soul. Mr. Bowers would deny that there is a ny design in our anatomy and physiology. Mr. Bowers would deny that young people can/shoul d control their passions and appetites. Mr. Bowers would deny that sexual appe tite, like other appetites, can b ecome corrupted, distorted, perverted, addictive and corrected.

Birkett From: Kati To: Council Packet Subject: Conversion Therapy Bill [CAUTION] This email comes from a sender outside your organization. Dear City Council, I oppose the current ordinance being considered for conversion therapy because it will have many unintended consequences if passed. There will be victims of sexual abus e that will feel like they cannot get help anywhere if someone of the same sex has been the abuser. Persons who feel that they do not want same sex attraction and would like help for those feelings would not be able to seek out how to change their thought processes through counseling in private places, such as mental health professionals, c hurch counselors/ministers, and peer counselors. This is a harmful legislation to consider because it is not a clear cut issue. It is vague and can be used to harm the people it intends to help-the vulnerable and potentially confused. Please do your best to see that this does not pass, as it will hurt those populations that it intends to help. These matters need to stay between client and helper, and not have legislation introduced to limit, restrict, or eliminate hope-giving counsel. It doesn't matter if you are pro LGBTQIA+ or not, as this has the potential to harm more than help those who do not want to experience SSA or have b een sexually exploited by someone of the same sex and have trauma and confusion from those experiences.

I completely acknowledge that here are always outliers wh ere abuse and hurt happens. However, I expect this is the exception and not the rule. How many people could this ordinance effect? What are the unintended consequences? How many people might never get the help they need becaus e therapists are anxiously avo iding pressing into anything that might fall under this very broad and undefined ordinance? We often hear of the high depression and suicide rates in the LGBTQ community - if this ordinance passes, I fear that we will see it increase due to those who are unable to ge t the talk therapy they need to deal with trauma.

Dear City Council, I oppose the current ordinance being considered for conversi on therapy because it would completely restrict anyone from even looking into the possibility th at trauma, etc. might be the root cause and allowing them to process that trauma. This ordinance is extremely vague and undefined and could be implemented in not only licensed therapists but also to churches, ministries and even families. It is extremely concerning.

This is aimed at Youth who are going through confusing situations. Youth need guidance/mentors even those who do not share the same views Transitioning at a young age is most likely irreversible damage Walt Heyer is a man who was a transgender for 8 years and has a lot of regret and here is his website https://sexchangeregret.com/ We need to stop being so \"politically correct\" that we loose sigh t of what is right and wrong. We are loosing sight of ourselve s and beliefs. Our choices we make today could have strong repercussi ons in the future. God willing we make the right choices and not lead our children and youth down the wrong path. We should be here to guide them to what is right or wrong, not just go along with y oung people who have no idea that the choice they make in doing so, changes them for their lifetime and it's not just something temp orary or like pretend play.

Birkett From: Emmy To: Council Packet Cc: Rick Subject: Ordinance on Conversion Therapy [CAUTION] This email comes from a sender outside your organization. Dear City Council, I oppose the current ordinance being considered for conv ersion therapy because some young people with LGBTQ+ tendencies don't WANT to have those feelings. There is still no scientific evidence that children are \"born\" LGBTQ+ Sometimes, they experienced trauma and feel they way they feel because of it. ( Sexual Assault or Abuse for instance) It will open the door for other useful therapies to be banned in the future. What if my child thinks they are dog or likes killing people or torturing animals are we to just ignore that an d say, it is who they are & we need to embrace it?! As a Foster Mom and spouse of a Mental Health worker, I can tell you that the city IS not the one to be making this decision. Thank You, Emily Pollen 1334 Rose St. 35Angela M. Birkett To: Council Packet Subject: Ordinance regarding conversion therapy [CAUTION] This email comes from a sender outside your organization. Hello City Council, I wanted to email and let you know what I think about your ordinance for conversion therapy. I watched your last meeting online and it broke my heart to hear testimony after testimony of hurt people telling of their experiences. There is real hurt there in the LGBTQ community that must be acknowledged. My biggest concern is how broad and undefined the ordinance is. It includes cruel and inhumane things like shock therapy. Something that I agree absolutely should not be done - but that is also somethi ng that does not really happen anymore making an ordinance such as this one unnecessary. It also seems to include any talk therapy that does not co mpletely encourage them to the LGBTQ identity. I'm extremely concerned about this especially after chatting with my friend who also lives here in Lincoln. Prior to moving here, her daughter in 9th grade was bullied by another girl who took advan tage of her and used bully tactics to try to convince her that she was a lesbian. Her daughter spiraled into depression and eventually attempted suicide. Thankfully, they got her the help she needed through talk therapy where she was able to sift through all the hurt and find that she was not actually a lesbian and to see the damage that the other girl had done. She was able to find the truth of who she was and in her case, her truth was that she was heterosexual. Isn't that what the LGBTQ community is all about? Finding yo ur truth? What if this happened to my friend's daughter after an ordinance was in effect? Would she have been able to find her truth or would her therapist have been afraid to explore the option that in this instance, she was not LGBTQ but it was instead trauma? What about the groups of teenagers who think it's something c ool to do? Statistically speaki ng, it's likely that not each and every one of them are LGTBQ, right? Is it even remotely possible that ev en one of them are just a victim of peer pressure? If so, would they even be able to get the help they needed to find their truth? The fact is, humanity is complicated and messy and everyone is so very different. Generally speaking, who knows and cares more for someone than their parents and their therapist? I completely acknowledge that here are always outliers where abuse and hurt happens. However, I expect this is the exception and not the rule. How many people could this ordinance effect? What are the unintended consequences? Ho w many people might never get the help they need to find the truth of who they really are because therapists ar e anxiously avoiding pressing into anything that might fall under this very broad and undefined ordinance? Is the goal to get as many people in the LGBTQ community as possible? Or is it to help as many people find the truth of who they are, whatever that is - mind, body and soul? If the first option is the goal, this ordinance seems the obvious choice. But if the latter is the goal, we must allow for th erapists to have freedom and not worry about repercussions could happen should they explore this area of their clients lives. Councilman Bowers, I can see you have a big heart for help ing people. I can also see that the LGBTQ community is especially full of hurts. I would caution you that in attempting to help, you may in turn doom a whole group of people who cannot get the help they need to find the truth of who they really are. You speak of the high depression and suicide rates in the LGBTQ community - if you pass this ordinance, I fe ar that we will see it increase due to those who are unable to find the truth of who they are. 36 I hope you each will consider opposing th is ordinance - not out of an affront to the LGBTQ community- but rather out of a goal to allow therapists the freedom to help each and every client the way they personally need, to find the truth of who they are and what they were meant to be.

Hello, my name is Daniel Reinig, an d I live in Lincol n at 859 S 40th St. I am contacting you to ask that you oppo se the proposed Youth Mental Health Protection Ordinance that would violate the free speech and religious freedom rights of counselors and their patients. We can all agree that everyone should be treated with dignity and respect regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. We should also agree that all individuals and fam ilies should be free to choose the counseling goals best for them. These are decisions that should not be imposed on families or individuals by politicians. Professional regulations prohibit abusive and coercive ther apy, but this ordinance uses broad language to encompass any sort of counseling, including basic talk therapy. Freedom of speech is a fundamental right guaranteed by the First Amendment, and this proposed ordinance violates freedom of speech within a very private relationship. In a diverse and pluralistic society like ours, space must be given to people with differing views on how best to approach these sensitive issues. The City Council should not attempt to sanction the moral beliefs of its citizens with regards to human sexuality. This ordinance undermines individual freedom through its re strictions on counseling and unconstitutionally engages in viewpoint discrimination. The proposed ordinance demonstrates hostility toward many of the world's major religions, including Judaism, Islam, and Christianity, that teach about the sa credness of our biological design. These are sincere people of good faith who should not be punished for holding different beliefs on human sexuality than those currently in political power. A counselor shouldn't be used as a tool to im pose the government's views on their patients. I urge you to oppose the proposed Yo uth Mental Health Protection Ordinance.

Not only should Bowers and Leirion be censured for pr omoting such nonsense, they should be denounced, for putting both the present and future physical, mental and emotional health of our youth at risk. Not every child has the protection of good parents. But ev en when they are so graced, their parents shouldn't have to worry about such subversive id eas being crammed down their throats when they are out of sight and/or at \"school.\" Bowers and Leirion will attempt to push this agenda through on the 22nd in the Lincoln City Council Chamber.

Dear City Council, I oppose the current ordinance being consider ed for conversion therapy because I have seen the good that conversion therapy can do. At the same time I have seen how a belief that conversion therapy was bad and th e refusal to use it has been negative. I myself in highschool had a few friends go through a time where they questioned their sexuality. I felt pressured into this 'movement ' of questioning, but thankfully I had the option of talk therapy with a social worker from school and through that I was able to see how this was not a questioning for me, as mu ch as me just feeling 'left out' of this phenomenon/ social fad that swept through our highschool. Of those friends who 'questioned' their sexua lity due to this fad I had 2 of 5 friends who went on to decide that they were defin itely gay. Of those 2 friends both of their families just accepted them for who they 'w ere'. They were never bullied for it and went on with their lives. A few years after hi gh school one of those friends came to the realization that he was not indeed gay, he felt so much regret and anger becoming so depressed due to the unhappiness of their new r eality that they took their own life. It is my (and others) firm belief that if he had th e option of the therapies that I searched out (that he was refused due to his family pus hing for acceptance over discussion) he would still be with us. There are many things covered under this ordi nance that can be extremely healthy and helpful for our youth today. Please do not let this go through, I believe the consequences may have dire consequences. Thank you for your time, Amanda Owens 90Angela M.

To: Council Packet Subject: Conversion Therapy Amendm ent Changes Title 11, 21-18 [CAUTION] This email comes from a sender outside your organization. Council members, I am writing to you in regards to the amendment changes in Title 11 for 21-18 regarding conversion therapy for people 19 years old and younger. The change in this bill is concerning because it does not allow fo r conversation to occur. The teenage years can be a difficult season to navigate, especially alone. The more co nversation is allowed the better. It is not a good rule to live by to silence one or more groups of people's Constitutional freedoms because one does not agree with them. My biggest concern of this amendment is the youth who co nsider themselves transgender and want to start hormone therapy. During this young age they are still going through pube rty. Some medications or treatments they take may not be reversible. Walt Heyer is a man who lived a transgendere d life for years as a woman. He is not the only one who regretted his choice. Please visit his website called sexcha ngeregret.com and read the scientific information and first hand experience. Also, the amendment claims \"the City of Lincoln has a comp elling interest in protecting the physical and psychological well-being of minors, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, a nd transgender youth and in protecting its minors against exposure to serious harm caused by sexual orientation or ge nder identity change efforts or conversion therapy\" (Section 11.09.010, Item 2, Lines 10-13). We know that electroshock therapy is not common practice and I want to go on record saying that electroshock therapy is inhumane and should not be done to any person, but this is not stated in this amendment. Section 11.09.010, Item 2, Li nes 10-13 implies that the City of Linc oln (or the government) knows what is best to do for the youth of the city instead of the parents/ guardians. The City of Lincoln does not have the authority to take parental control over all of the youth of Linc oln, even those who are not in the LGBTQ community. Parents/guardians are also interested in the total well-b eing of the youth they were entrusted to care for. I implore you not to approve this am endment for the sake of the youth. Let them talk and have conversation freely. Additionally, if you decide to move forwar d in adjusting the amendment please consider another public hearing to address the changes.

(Photo: EvgeniiAnd/Getty Images) Children \"have been very seriously damaged\" in receiving treatment at the United Kingdom's premier gender identity facility, a former psychiatrist there says in a bombshell interview. 100Dr. David Bell faced disciplinary action after writing an internal report in 2018 raising concerns about procedures at The Tavistock and Portma n NHS Foundation Trust , which operates the U.K.'s sole \"Gende r Identity Development Service.\" After working with Tavistock a nd Portman for 24 years as a consultant psychiatrist, Bell recently retired. In the interview with London-based Channel 4 News, he speaks openly about his observations about giving children p uberty blockers, treating every girl with a gender or sexual issue as \"conversion thera py,\" and politicizing support for transgender children. Right away, Bell isn't shy about relating the concerns of parents and others about Tavistock's treatment plans. He tells reporter Cathy Newman: Want to keep up with the 24/7 news cycle? Want to know the most important stories of the day for conservatives? Need news you can tr ust? Subscribe to The Daily Signal's email newsletter. Learn more >> I was a representative of the clinical and acade mic staff. The concerns that were brought to me were very, very serious. The main concerns were issues that had to do with ... lack of consent. Many of the people who spoke to me did not think their children were able to consent to the treatment. Then there were concerns of children being inappropriately pushed through to transition, where they had a lot of complex problems that really needed thinking about. The whole attitude of what's called 'affirmation' instead of neutrality and inquiry caused considerable damage to the capacity of the service and clinicians to take on the full complexities of the cases they were dealing with. As a result, children have been very seriously damaged. Newman asks the psychiatrist in the intervie w whether children are at risk while receiving treatments at Tavistock. Bell replies: \"They're less at risk now because the puberty blockers have been stopped. The puberty blockers have been stopped because there is no evidence base for them at all. ... By putting them on that pathway, it rath er becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.\" In December, a panel of three judges on the High Court of Justice issued a landmark ruling restricting Tavistock from issuing puberty bloc kers to children under 16. The High Court is one of the U.K.'s three senior courts under its Supreme Court. 101The judges made their decision in part because of the testimony of Keir a Bell, who is known in the U.K. for speaking out against the use of puberty blockers, which Tavistock prescribed to her when she wanted to become a male. Channel 4's Newman asks Bell a bout the High Court ruling in that case regarding kids under 16. The psychiatrist calls the decision \"really important because it acts to protect them.\" Bell later says that the \"positioning of these girls as only having a gender problem acts to prevent them from developing in a normal way and their own nonconforming gender identity or sexuality\" and adds: \"This is a form of conversion therapy among people that are gay or lesbian.\" Newman asks Bell whether he \"might be on the wrong side of history\" in failing to be as vocally supportive of the transgender movement as one might expect from someone who worked at a gender clinic for decades. He appears to have no qualms about tying the ge nder debate to politics, saying later that \"one of the things gone terribly wrong in the Tavistock and elsewhere is the invasion of the clinical domain by the political ideology.\" Bell articulates the very phenomenon that has grown in the United States as well: This is a very highly politicized area. And leaders from movements with a very powerful ideological commitment have managed to capture policy both medically, professionally, in the media, and in government with no evidence basis, a purely highly politicized movement; we just have these consequences. All I'm saying ... is [the childre n] need to wait. There needs to be a thoughtful engagement with them as opposed to motoring them through to treatment pathways that have irreversible consequences for their bodies. We'r e talking about not doing harm to children. Bell is at his most compelling when he disc usses a real-life example of someone who is struggling with her sexuality. \"Let me put it very simply. A girl of 12 may fi nd that she is sexually attracted to other girls,\" Bell says, adding: It may go through her mind: ... Maybe I'm not a girl. Maybe I'm a boy . If that happened 10-15 years ago, that would have been a passi ng phase and things would have moved on. 102But now because of hugely changed cultural c ontext and the penetration of social media, such a girl may go online and she may easily co me to the belief ... that she is a boy. And that having reached that [conclusion] ... there will be lots of forces around her that will support it, and all her other difficulties w ill be repositioned through that prism. Although Bell says he doesn't believe that Tavi stock tried to push him toward retirement or \"hound him out,\" he says the facility made it cl ear \"that people like me that spoke out will come under the scrutiny in this very negative way.\" \"I think it's like a message to everyone else w ho don't have my seniority , my safety: Oh, my God, I better not speak out, they'll think I'm transphobic.\" Bell's comments during this interview c onfirm that the High Court made the right decision when it ruled that Tavistock must stop givi ng puberty blockers to children under 16. The psychiatrist's articulations about gender ideology as a political movement, whether in the U.K. or the United States, are spot on.

Dear Council Members: I am contacting you to request that you oppose the proposed Youth Mental Health Protection Ordinance currently under consideration. It is extremely important that y oung people and their parents be presented with all factors involved in the emotional and physical issues concerning sexual orientation and gender identity. Recommendations and treatments can have profound and sometimes irreversible effects. Children placed on puberty blockers may have slower rates of growth in height, and an elevated risk of low bone-mineral density. Females given testosterone can develop acne, bear d growth, deepened voice, and may be at risk of heart disease, vaginal and uterine atr ophy, uterine cancer, and sterilization. Males given estrogen may be more likely to have st rokes and heart attacks, and have a higher risk of blood clots. And then there are the long term a nd often irreversible effects of surgery for transitioning. Counselors, psychologists, and doctors should have t he opportunity to objectively discuss these and other critical factors with patient s and their parents, so they can be aware of the seriousness of their decisions. Therefore I respectfully urge you to oppose the Youth Mental Health Protection Ordinance. Sincerely, Stuart P. Westburg, M.D, 1100 Cobblestone Drive 68510 To: Council Packet Subject: Conversion Therapy Amendm ent Changes Title 11, 21-18 [CAUTION] This email comes from a sender outside your organization. Council members, I am writing in regards to the amendment changes in Title 11 fo r 21-18 regarding conversion therapy. I do not support these changes and would like to s ee them removed from consideration. As a parent and a citizen, it is my righ t, not the government's to determine what is proper care for myself and my dependent children. While I agre e that certain forms of conversion therapy, including electroshock are inhumane and should be outlawed, the changes in this proposed amendment go fa r beyond just that. This amendment would make it criminal to even discuss opposing viewpoints re garding transgenderism and sexual orientation. Restricting speech and freedom of religion both violate a number of constitutionally guaranteed freedoms, both in the US and Nebraska constitutions, such as \"All pe rsons have a natural and inde feasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own c onsciences. No person shall be compelled to... nor shall any interference with the rights of conscience be permitted.\" (NE State Constitution section 1-4. Religious Freedom) If my conscience, due to my worship of Almighty God, tells me that transgenderism and homosexuality are sins, I should be able to have a di scussion about my religious beliefs with my children without fear that that discussion will lead to my arrest or censure. If I wish to lead my family based on biblical truth, that is my constitutionally guaranteed ri ght as a citizen of the United States of Am erica and my Biblical duty as a believer in Almighty God. This amendment would abridge both those rights and is a direct violation of both the United States and the State of Nebraska constitutions as it is written, and as such must be remove d from consideration. I request that this e-mail be included as part of the public hearing record. Thank You, Aaron Hiltgen 121Angela M.

Holtzen, a resident at 5430 Stephanie Court in Lincoln: I urge you to oppose the proposed Y outh Mental Health Protection Ordinance. It would not only prohibit counselors from serving their patients, but could also cause clients to be reluctant to seek the type of help they may have a strong desire to receive from their counselor. The city government should not be used to dictate beliefs about human sexuality upon their citizens. This would infringe upon the freedom of free speech of both the counselor and the client and would be unconstitutional.

My name is Chris Oerman, and my address is 5660 NW 11th Circle in Lincoln. I am writing to request that you oppose the proposed Youth Mental Health Protection Ordinanc e. This dangerous proposal would violate the free speech and religious freedom rights of counselors, patients, and their families. While I believe that everyone should be treated with respect regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, we should also agree that all individuals and fa milies should be free to choose the counseling goals they deem best in their situation. Furthermore, counselors must not be reduced to mere tools used to impose the government's preferred view on their patients. In a truly pluralistic society like ours, the freedom of people with differing views regarding how best to approach these sensitive issues must be preserved. The City Council should not overreach by sanctioning the moral beliefs of its citizens with regards to human sexuality. The proposed ordinance demonstrates extreme animus toward many of the world's major religions-- including Judaism, Islam, and Christianity, to name but a few --that teach about and profess the sacredness of our biological desi gn. These are sin cere people of good faith who should not be punished for holding different beliefs on human sexuality than those currently in political power.

Birkett Packet Subject: Concerned Citizen Importance: High [CAUTION] This email comes from a sender outside your organization. Council Members- It would appear Mr. Bowers took an oath to tear down our Constitution rather than support it, and to replace it with rights only for a few...rights for people only like him. These rights would include the right to virtually any sexual activity of their choice, without interference from parents, teachers, pastors, counselors, etc. The effect would be to also grant minors the right to expect society at large to bear the cost for any negative consequences from their illicit and immoral sexual activity. Mr. Bowers would deny that unprotected and untrained children are susceptible and vulnerable to bad/harmful influences, and that many dark voices vie for their attention and try to get the upper hand, before good character is established. Mr. Bowers would deny that children need to be trained, disciplined, nurtured and educated, morally, mentally and physically. Mr. Bowers would elevate sexuality to the pinnacle of human identity and experience, rather than reason and mind/soul. Mr. Bowers would deny that there is any design in our anatomy and physiology. Mr. Bowers would deny that young people can /should control their passions and appetites. Mr. Bowers would deny that sexual appetite, like other appetites, can be corrupted, perverted, addictive and corrected. Mr. Bowers would allow the passions and appetites of our young to become perverted. Mr. Bowers would then have them become slaves to those perverted carnal passions and appetites. Mr. Bowers would deny the pangs of conscience, and blam e difficult feelings on others...on those trying to help those who have fallen for a lie. Mr. Bowers is projecti ng his own insecurities. Mr. Bowers wants to add another dimension to the lockdown lunacy. He wants to lock our young in bondage to sin so he doesn't have to deal with his own conscience. Let even one person discover freedom, and it's all over, should he learn of it. The fight is on, once again, with his own conscience and he can't bear it. Mr. Bowers would have us believe that only those strugg ling with deviant sexual desires experience emotional and mental pain and anguish. Do I exaggerate in any of this? If so, it isn't by much. What Mr. Bowers ought to do, rather than pursue this ordinance change, is repent. Thank you for your time. Very concerned Lincolnite!

Dear Lincoln City Council I am contacting you to ask that yo u oppose the proposed Youth Mental Health Protection Ordinance that would violate the free speech and religious freed om rights of counselors and their patients. First of all, I would like I express my appreciate for those who are trul y concerned about what 'conversion therapy' may cause. I am also sorry to hear that some f eel they have extensively tried this approach, but that it didn't 'work' for them. I must express my concerns in regards to eliminating this option , however. Despite how it may be portrayed in common media outlets, many have been Helped by this type of therapy , which actually encompasses a rather large body of work, and may even include stragies those who testified know not of (ex research and approach es of Joe Dallas-not PC, but widely acclaimed and found helpful by many, none the less). Just like any therap y, it also requires a person to be in a position of wanting and willing to make a change in how they are currently feelin g in these regards.

I will have copies of emails I sent to the Planning Dept, City Council, and Mayors office (available to Hartley Neighborhood Assoc.) telling about th e flooding that happens in the west Wyuka area where the 'Gatehouse Row Project\" is in the planning stages. Hopefully that wi ll help the people living in the project to collect for damages from flooding if the project is allowed. This will happen when dur ing a heavy rain water runs down the alleys (washing the rock to 35the street) and the water runs down the stre ets with no storm water drains from 33rd and O NE to the one storm water drain at 36th and Vine. Along with the water that runs down the roadways of State owned Wyuka and the pond overflows to run to the same area to slowly run away after backing up to 36th and R. Wyuka knows what happens. Th is is the reason the area is unusable to them for burials. BUT i guess (someone thinks) for mone y it is good enough for low income people. Also a few years ago young girls tipped ove r stones in the area. What kind of fence is going to be put up to stop things like this from happening with children playing in the area. Betty and Jerald Hunter 3501 S Street 2Angela M. Birkett Gate House Row, Wyuka [CAUTION] This email comes from a sender outside your organization. To Whom It May Concern, If a development is to happen at Wyuka, NW corner, I hope it is the fewest number of units or smallest development possible. We need more housing in Lincoln so something could be built, but smaller is better in this \"Park\" of a cemetery! Thanks, Tom Dierks 3510 2021 PM To: Council Packet Subject: Gate House Row Wyuka Project Attachments: 35th St Traffic.JPG [CAUTION] This email comes from a sender outside your organization. From: Tom Armstrong <tomarmstrong007@yahoo.com> Sent: Tuesday, February Subject: tom armstrong PM PST Subject: Gate House Row Wyuka Project Greetings to those involved in the decision re garding, the Gate Row House Apartment Project. There are many red flags regarding this project but I will only touch on a couple, as safety for the citizens of Lincoln should always lead the way, I will begin with the traffic problem. Attached is a photo taken at 4pm on a Thursday afternoon on North 35th St., three houses south of Vine St. Eight vehicles are lined up awaiting their turn to go left or right, the only through street between 33rd St. and 48th St., that allows this directional choice. It's this limited acce ss to Vine St. that puts so much traffic in front of my home, making the intersection of 35th & Vine St. one of the most dangerous in Lincoln. Many times over the years I've heard the sound of a collision coming from the corner, with phone in hand I race to the scene calling 911 and checking on, and comforting those involved. The proposal of adding an additional 250 more vehicles , to this already congested neighborhood by building a 98 unit apartment complex along North 36th St., with no other ex its to Vine St. or O St., can only cause more traffic congestion and accidents. If you look closely at the photo you will notice in the upper left corner the green sign that indicates that 35th St. is also a Bicycle Route. Daily I see bicycle commuters travelli ng each direction, likely to UNL East Campus or the Mopac Trail, or a work location. As the weather 4becomes nicer 35th St. becomes busier, adding leisure cy clists to the mix of bicyclists utilizing the only available crossing of Vine St. Again, adding 250 more vehicles to this street will do uble the traffic on the street and in the photo, making 35th St. to dangerous to ride. And since 35th St. is the only throug h north and south street designated as a Bicycle Route that gives such important access to students walking and bicycling to UNL, isn't this something to be considered in the long-ter m planning of this mega apartment proposal? Also, from the twenty years I have lived in the neighbo rhood and taken leisurely walks through Historic Wyuka Cemetery, it's important to know that the creek that runs north and south behi nd the proposed building project floods regularly, as it drains O St., and the neighborhood south of O St. The R St. entrance into Wy uka where the bridge crosses the stream was so badly damaged a few years ago that the bridge was rebuilt and resurfaced. During that particular flood, water swamped the lower region to Vine St., threatening the apartments at 3535 Vine St. In Summary, this proposed project of 98 units in multiple buildings, stretchi ng four blocks with no new access to Vine St. or O St., is overkill, certainly for a neighborhood that CAN NOT handle it. Thank You for your time and consideration, Thomas Armstrong Hartley Resident of 20 years. 5Angela M. Birkett From: Rhonda hartleyneighborhoodassociation@gmail.com Subject: Gate House Row, Wyuka [CAUTION] This email comes from a sender outside your organization. To Whom it May Concern: I am writing in support of cons truction of new affordable housing along the west edge of Wyuka cemetery, at a density of 54 housing units. I oppose co nstruction of the 98 unit complex--Gate House Row Apartments--proposed by Fred Hoppe of Hoppe Homes. Under the banner \"affordable housing\" Hoppe Ho mes' proposed mega-comple x will: create the most physically dense living environment allowed. Th is complex will over-str ess both the natural and human environment, and progressively denigrate the cohesive, vibrant and diverse Hartley neighborhood. A 98 unit complex on the proposed site will double the effective R4 zoning density of the neighborhood. As no new streets will be built, t he projected 700+ trips per day generated by the complex will funnel through existing residential streets. The neighbor hood will turn into a thoroughfare and cease to be a safely walkable and bikeable area, particularly for Hartley elementary students. Wyuka cemetery (under Neighborhood Watch) is curr ently a green space utilized by the city as well as the neighborhood. The proposed complex covers mu ch of this green space, and compromises access to the rest. The developer promises to keep the R street pedestrian gate open, however, given greatly increased local traffi c, it seems inevitable that Wyuka cemetery would soon close this entrance. I support a revised Hartley Neighborhood Association proposal, constructing 54 units on this site. While 54 new units would be more dense that Hart ley's current actual established density, the neighborhood can live with t he increase. With 98 units the projec t is hardly compatible with the existing neighborhood. For example, the project proposes 38 two and three story units along the East side of 36th St between Q and R Sts. Across the str eet are 6 duplexes and 1 house, for 13 units. 13 vs 38 units. That's 3 times as many, with front yard setbacks reduced from 25 to 10 ft, and the same for the backyards, because one third of the land is a floodway. Affordable housing at a densit y with 54 units supports the Resilient Lincoln vision, \"a city that is inclusive, welcoming and fair\". It s upports the long term stability and livability of Hartley Neighborhood, historically a dive rse, vibrant area. Construction of new affordable housing which prioritizes stability and livabilit y is welcome. The 98 unit mega housing complex proposed by Hoppe Homes may rent for below market value, but it simply exploits existing resources--including the current stability of t he neighborhood--to the financ ial gain of the builder. Please oppose Hoppe's 98 unit complex proposal and approve a revised proposal of 54 units. 6 Respectfully, Rhonda Schoenmaker 3411 S Street Lincoln NE 68503-3339 7Angela hartleyneighborhoodassociation@gmail.com Subject: Gate House Row, Wyuka [CAUTION] This email comes from a sender outside your organization. Dear Members of the Lincoln City Council: The Irvingdale Neighborhood Association Board would like to go on record in support of the Hartley Neighborhood Association in the position that they ha ve taken regarding the proposed \"Gate House Row, Wyuka\" project. Like Hartley residents, Irvingdale residents understand the need for, and support the development of, additional affordable housing in Lincoln. Also like Hartley resi dents, Irvingdalers do not feel that the onus to accommodate affordable housing should reside exclusively with the older neighborhood s. We feel that the Hartley neighborhood is being very reasonable in welcoming 54 new hous ing units through the Gate House Row Apartments, even though it will change the esta blished density of thei r neighborhood. The proposed 98 units will not only change the density, but al so the historic charact er of the neighborhood. In addition, the Hartley Neighborhood A ssociation's request for 2 parking spaces per unit, rather than the proposed 1.4 parking spaces per unit is also sensible. The Hartley request is consistent with the current City standard. That standard was determined after mu ch research and was established for a purpose! Please take the position of the Har tley Neighborhood Associati on into account when considering this project. Know that they are not alone in their thinking, as their requests only serv e to make Lincoln a better, safer, more hospitable home for all. Sincerely, Geri Cotter President, Irvingdale Ne Packet; Tammy J. James M. Bowers Subject: Against Gate House Row, Wyuka Proposal [CAUTION] This email comes from a sender outside your organization. Hello, I am against the proposed development referred to as Gate House Row, Wyuka, for a number of reasons. Hartley neighborhood is already one of th e the most densely populated neighborhoods in the city of Lincoln. It is one of the oldest neighborhoods, with a high concentration of racial and ethnic diversity, and our residents disproportionately fall into the low income category. The 'green belt' of land currently zoned as public use, is a vi tal part of the fabric of thi s historic neighborhood. Our families utilize this space as a place to gather, walk pets, exercise and enjoy the historic natural setting. Replacing this unique feature with a 98 uni t apartment complex would have a huge negative impact on the neighborhood, and the city as a whole. It would foreve r alter the historic neighborhood, increase traffic in an already stressed infrastructure, raise th e density to unacceptable levels, and send the message that segregating racially diverse and low income residents into certain areas of the city is a valid strategy for the city to move toward its goals of providing adequate housing to ou r more vulnerable populations. The proposed development cannibalizes historic land and offe rs housing that has no path to homeownership to its residents, not to mention the critical lack of park ing and access to arterial streets (Vine, O Street). Please vote against this proposed development, and work towards meeting housing goals that respect neighborhoods, historic land, homeownership opportunities, neighborhood safety , diversity in housing, and existing zoning practices. We can do better than this! Thank you for your service, and consideration. Sue Burkey 3528 Q Lincoln, NE "}
